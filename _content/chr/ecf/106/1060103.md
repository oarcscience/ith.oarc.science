<span id="vi.v.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—On the Position Given to the
Preaching of John the Baptist in All the Four Evangelists.</span>

<span id="vi.v.vii-p2"></span>18. Now at this point commences the
account of the preaching of John, which is presented by all the four.
For after the words which I have placed last in the order of his
narrative thus far,—the words with which he introduces the testimony
from the prophet, namely, He shall be called a Nazarene,—Matthew
proceeds immediately to give us this recital: “In those days came John
the Baptist, preaching in the wilder<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>
<span id="vi.v.vii-Page_113"></span>ness of Judæa,”  <span
id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762) etc. And Mark, who has told us nothing
of the nativity or infancy or youth of the Lord, has made his Gospel
begin with the same event,—that is to say, with the preaching of John.
For it is thus that he sets out: The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus
Christ, the Son of God; as it is written in the prophet Isaiah, <span
id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763) Behold, I send a messenger <span
id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764) before Thy face, which shall prepare
Thy way before Thee. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare
ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight. John was in the
wilderness baptizing, and preaching the baptism of repentance for the
remission of sins, <span id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765) etc. Luke,
again, follows up the passage in which he says, “And Jesus increased in
wisdom and age, <span id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766) and in favour
with God and man,” by a section in which he speaks of the preaching of
John in these terms: Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius
Cæsar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judæa, and Herod being tetrarch
of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituræa and of the region
of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, Annas and Caiaphas
being the high priests, the word of God came unto John, the son of
Zacharias, in the wilderness,  <span id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767)
etc. The Apostle John, too, the most eminent of the four evangelists,
after discoursing of the Word of God, who is also the Son, antecedent to
all the ages of creaturely existence, inasmuch as all things were made
by Him, has introduced in the immediate context his account of the
preaching and testimony of John, and proceeds thus: There was a man sent
from God, whose name was John. <span id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768)
This will be enough at once to make it plain that the narratives
concerning John the Baptist given by the four evangelists are not at
variance with one another. And there will be no occasion for requiring
or demanding that to be done in all detail in this instance which we
have already done in the case of the genealogies of the Christ who was
born of Mary, to the effect of proving how Matthew and Luke are in
harmony with each other, of showing how we might construct one
consistent narrative out of the two, and of demonstrating on behoof of
those of less acute perception, that although one of these evangelists
may mention what the other omits, or omit what the other mentions, he
does not thereby make it in any sense difficult to accept the veracity
of the account given by the other. For when a single example \[of this
method of harmonizing\] has been set before us, whether in the way in
which it has been presented by me, or in some other method in which it
may more satisfactorily be exhibited, every man can understand that, in
all other similar passages, what he has seen done here may be done
again.

<span id="vi.v.vii-p10"></span>19. Accordingly, let us now study, as I
have said, the harmony of the four evangelists in the narratives
regarding John the Baptist. Matthew proceeds in these terms: In those
days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judæa. <span
id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769) Mark has not used the phrase “In those
days,” because he has given no recital of any series of events at the
head of his Gospel immediately before this narrative, so that he might
be understood to speak in reference to the dates of such events under
the terms, “In those days.” <span id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770)
Luke, on the other hand, with greater precision has defined those times
of the preaching or baptism of John, by means of the notes of the
temporal power. For he says: Now, in the fifteenth year of the reign of
Tiberius Cæsar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judæa, and Herod being
tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of
the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, Annas
and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John, the
son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. <span
id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771) We ought not, however, to understand
that what was actually meant by Matthew when He said, “In those days,”
was simply the space of days literally limited to the specified period
of these powers. On the contrary, it is apparent that he intended the
note of time which was conveyed in the phrase “In those days,” to be
taken to refer to a much longer period. For he first gives us the
account of the return of Christ from Egypt after the death of Herod,—an
incident, indeed, which took place at the time of His infancy or
childhood, and with which, consequently, Luke’s statement of what befell
Him in the temple when He was twelve years of age is quite
consistent. <span id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772) Then, immediately
after this narrative of the recall of the infant or boy out of Egypt,
Matthew continues thus in due order: “Now, in those days came John the
Baptist.” And thus under that phrase he certainly covers not merely the
days of His childhood, but all the days intervening between His nativity
and this period at which John began to preach and to baptize. At this
period, moreover, Christ is found already to have attained to man’s
estate;  <span id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773) for John and he were of
the same age; <span id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774) and it is stated
that He was about <span id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775) thirty years
of age when He was baptized by the former.
