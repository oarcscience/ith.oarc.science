<p class="c39"><a name="vi.v.lxxii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="vi.v.lxxii-p1.1"></A>Chapter LXXI.&#8212;Of the Marriage of the King&#146;s Son, to Which the Multitudes Were Invited; And of the Order in Which Matthew Introduces that Section as Compared with Luke, Who Gives Us a Somewhat Similar Narrative in Another Connection.</span></p>  			 
<p class="c22"><a name="vi.v.lxxii-p2"></A>139. Matthew goes on as follows: &#8220;And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard His parables, they perceived that He spake of them: and when they sought to lay hands on Him, they feared the multitude, because they took Him for a prophet. And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son, and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the 				wedding, and they would not come;&#8221; and so on, down to the words, &#8220;For many are called, but few are chosen.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1162"></A><A HREF="#fn_1162"><FONT SIZE="1">1163</FONT></A>
 This parable concerning the guests who were invited to the wedding is related only by Matthew. Luke also records something which resembles it. But that is really a different passage, as the order itself sufficiently indicates, although there is some similarity between the two.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1163"></A><A HREF="#fn_1163"><FONT SIZE="1">1164</FONT></A>
 The matters introduced, however, by Matthew immediately after the parable concerning the vineyard, and the killing of the son of the head of the house,&#8212;namely, the Jews&#146; perception that this whole discourse was directed against them, and their beginning to contrive treacherous schemes against Him,&#8212;are attested likewise by Mark and Luke, who also keep the same order in inserting them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1164"></A><A HREF="#fn_1164"><FONT SIZE="1">1165</FONT></A>
 But after this paragraph they proceed to another subject, and immediately subjoin a passage which Matthew has also indeed introduced in due order, but only subsequently to this parable of the marriage, which he alone has put on record here.</p>
