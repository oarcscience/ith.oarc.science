<span id="vi.v.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—Of the Occasion on Which He
Calls Them to Take His Yoke and Burden Upon Them, and of the Question as
to the Absence of Any Discrepancy Between Matthew and Luke in the Order
of Narration.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxxiv-p2"></span>80. Matthew proceeds thus: “At that time
Jesus answered and said, I make my acknowledgment to Thee, <span
id="fr_995"></span>[996](#fn_995) O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent,” and so on,
down to where we read, “For my yoke is easy, and my burden is
light.” <span id="fr_996"></span>[997](#fn_996) This passage is also
noticed by Luke, but only in part. For he does not give us the words,
“Come unto me, all ye that labour,” and the rest. It is, however, quite
legitimate to suppose that all this may have been said on one occasion
by the Lord, and yet that Luke has not recorded the whole of what was
said on that occasion. For Matthew’s phrase is, that “at that time Jesus
answered and said;” by which is meant the time after His upbraiding of
the cities. Luke, on the other hand, interposes some matters, although
they are not many, after that upbraiding of the cities; and then he
subjoins this sentence: “In that hour He rejoiced in the Holy
Spirit, <span id="fr_997"></span>[998](#fn_997) and said.” <span
id="fr_998"></span>[999](#fn_998) Thus, too, we see that even if
Matthew’s expression had been, not “at that time,” but “in that very
hour,” still what Luke inserts in the interval is so little that it
would not appear an unreasonable thing to give it as all spoken in the
same hour.
