<span id="v.ii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.</span>

<span id="v.ii.xiv-p2"></span>39. “It hath been said, Whosoever shall
put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement.” This is
the lesser righteousness of the Pharisees, which is not opposed by what
our Lord says: “But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his
wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit
adultery: <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124) and whosoever shall
marry her that is loosed from her husband committeth adultery.” <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125) For He who gave the commandment that a
writing of divorcement should be given, did not give the commandment
that a wife should be put away; but “whosoever shall put away,” says He,
“let him give her a writing of divorcement,” in order that the thought
of such a writing might moderate the rash anger of him who was getting
rid of his wife. And, therefore, He who sought to interpose a delay in
putting away, indicated as far as He could to hard-hearted men that He
did not wish separation. And accordingly the Lord Himself in another
passage, when a question was asked Him as to this matter, gave this
reply: “Moses did so because of the hardness of your hearts.” <span
id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126) For however hard-hearted a man may be
who wishes to put away his wife, when he reflects that, on a writing of
divorcement being given her, she could then without risk marry another,
he would be easily appeased. Our Lord, therefore, in order to confirm
that principle, that a wife should not lightly be put away, made the
single exception of fornication; but enjoins that all other annoyances,
if any such should happen to spring up, be borne with fortitude for the
sake of conjugal fidelity and for the sake of chastity; and he also
calls that man an adulterer who should marry her that has been divorced
by her husband. And the Apostle Paul shows the limit of this state of
affairs, for he says it is to be observed as long as her husband liveth;
but on the husband’s death he gives permission to marry. <span
id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127) For he himself also held by this rule,
and therein brings forward not his own advice, as in the case of some of
his admonitions, but a command by the Lord when he says: “And unto the
married <span id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128) I command, yet not I,
but the Lord, Let not the wife <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129)
depart from her husband: but and if she depart, let her remain
unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put
away his wife.” <span id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130) I believe that,
according to a similar rule, if he shall put her away, he is to remain
unmarried, or be reconciled to his wife. For it may happen that he puts
away his wife for the cause of fornication, which our Lord wished to
make an exception of. But now, if she is not allowed to marry while the
husband is living from whom she has departed, nor he to take another
while the wife is living whom he has put away, much less is it right to
commit unlawful acts of fornication with any parties whomsoever. More
blessed indeed are those marriages to be reckoned, where the parties
concerned, whether after the procreation of children, or even through
contempt of such an earthly progeny, have been able with common consent
to practise self-restraint toward each other: both because nothing is
done contrary to that precept whereby the Lord forbids a spouse to be
put away (for he does not put her away who lives with her not carnally,
but spiritually), and because that principle is observed to which the
apostle gives expression, “It remaineth, that they that have wives be as
though they had none.” <span id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131)
