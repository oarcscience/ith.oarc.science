<span id="vi.vi.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Of the Question Whether the
First Three Evangelists are Quite in Harmony with John in the Accounts
Given of His Burial.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.xxiv-p2"></span>60. Matthew proceeds thus: “And when
Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and
laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he
rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.” <span
id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466) Mark’s version is as follows: “And
he bought fine linen, <span id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467) and
took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen, and laid Him in a sepulchre
which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the
sepulchre.” <span id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468) Luke reports it
in those terms: “And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid
it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was
laid.” <span id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469) So far as these three
narratives are concerned, no allegation of a want of harmony can
possibly be raised. John, however, tells us that the burial of the Lord
was attended to not only by Joseph, but also by Nicodemus. For he begins
with Nicodemus in due connection with what precedes, and goes on with
his narrative as follows: “And there came also Nicodemus (which at the
first came to Jesus by night), and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes,
about an hundred pound weight.”  <span
id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470) Then, introducing Joseph again at
this point, he continues in these terms: “Then took they the body of
Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the <span id="page_208">p.
208</span> <span id="vi.vi.xxiv-Page_208"></span>spices, as the manner
of the Jews is to bury. Now in the place where He was crucified there
was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man
yet laid. There laid they Jesus, therefore, because of the Jews’
preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.”  <span
id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471) But there is really as little
ground for supposing any discrepancy here as there was in the former
case, if we take a correct view of the statement. For those evangelists
who have left Nicodemus unnoticed have not affirmed that the Lord was
buried by Joseph alone, although he is the only one introduced into
their records. Neither does the fact, that these three are all at one in
informing us how the Lord was wrapped in the linen cloth by Joseph,
preclude us from entertaining the idea that other linen stuffs may have
been brought by Nicodemus, and added to what was given by Joseph, so
that John may be perfectly correct in his narrative, especially as what
he tells us is that the Lord was wrapped not in a linen cloth, but in
linen clothes. <span id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472) At the same
time, when we take into account the handkerchief which was used for the
head, and the bandages with which the whole body was swathed, and
consider that all these were made of linen, we can see how, even
although there was really but a single linen cloth \[of the kind
referred to by the first three evangelists\] there, it could still have
been stated with the most perfect truth that “they wound Him in linen
clothes.” For the phrase, linen clothes, is one applied generally to all
textures made of flax.
