<p class="c22"><a name="vi.vii.i-p2"></A>1. As we have examined Matthew&#146;s narrative in its complete connection, and as the comparison which we have carried out between it and the other three on to its conclusion has established the fact, that not one of these evangelists contains anything either at variance with other statements in his own Gospel, or inconsistent with the accounts presented by his fellow-historians, let us now subject Mark to a similar scrutiny. Our plan will be to omit those sections which 				he has in common with Matthew, which we have already investigated as far as seemed requisite and are now done with, and to take up those paragraphs which remain, with the view of submitting them to discussion and comparison, and of demonstrating their thorough harmony with what is related by the other evangelists on to the notice of the Lord&#146;s Supper. For we have already dealt with all the incidents which are reported in all the four Gospels from that point on to the end, and have considered 				the subject of their mutual consistency.</p>
