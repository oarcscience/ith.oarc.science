<p class="c39"><a name="vi.vi.xiii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="vi.vi.xiii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XII.&#8212;Of the Concord Preserved Among All the Four Evangelists on the Subject of the Parting of His Raiment.</span></p>  			 
<p class="c22"><a name="vi.vi.xiii-p2"></A>39. Matthew goes on thus: &#8220;And after they crucified Him, they parted His garments, casting lots: and sitting down, they watched Him.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1380"></A><A HREF="#fn_1380"><FONT SIZE="1">1381</FONT></A>
 Mark reports the same incident, as follows: &#8220;And crucifying Him, they parted His garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1381"></A><A HREF="#fn_1381"><FONT SIZE="1">1382</FONT></A>
 In like manner Luke says: &#8220;And they parted His raiment, and cast lots. And the people stood beholding.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1382"></A><A HREF="#fn_1382"><FONT SIZE="1">1383</FONT></A>
 The occurrence is thus recorded briefly by the first three. But John gives us a more detailed narrative of the method in which the act was gone about. His version runs thus: &#8220;Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also His coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that 				the Scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments, and for my vesture they did cast lots.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1383"></A><A HREF="#fn_1383"><FONT SIZE="1">1384</FONT></A>
