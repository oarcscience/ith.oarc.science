id="vi.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Of the Fact That, on the Subject
of the Destruction of Idols, the Apostles Taught Nothing Different from
What Was Taught by Christ or by the Prophets.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi-p2"></span>24. Nevertheless these persons argue
still to the effect that this demolition of temples, and this
condemnation of sacrifices, and this shattering of all images, are
brought about, not in virtue of the doctrine of Christ Himself, but only
by the hand of His apostles, who, as they contend, taught something
different from what He taught. They think by this device, while
honouring and lauding Christ, to tear the Christian faith in pieces. For
it is at least true, that it is by the disciples of Christ that at once
the works and the words of Christ have been made known, on which this
Christian religion is established, with which a very few people of this
character are still in antagonism, who do not now indeed openly assail
it, but yet continue even in these days to utter their mutterings
against it. But if they refuse to believe that Christ taught in the way
indicated, let them read the prophets, who not only enjoined the
complete destruction of the superstitions of idols, but also predicted
that this subversion would come to pass in Christian times. And if these
spoke falsely, why is their word fulfilled with so mighty a
demonstration? But if they spoke truly, why is resistance offered to
such divine power? <span id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566)
