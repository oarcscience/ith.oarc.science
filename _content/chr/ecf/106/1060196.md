<span id="vi.vi.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Of the Harmony of the Four
Evangelists in Their Notices of the Draught of Vinegar.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.xviii-p2"></span>54. Matthew proceeds in the following
terms: “Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land
unto the ninth hour.” <span id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435) The
same fact is attested by two others of the evangelists. <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436) Luke adds, however, a statement of
the cause of the darkness, namely, that “the sun was darkened.” Again,
Matthew continues thus: “And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a
loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani! that is to say, My God,
my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? And some of them that stood there,
when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.” <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437) Mark’s agreement with this is
almost complete, so far as regards the words, and not only almost, but
altogether complete, so far as the sense is concerned. Matthew next
makes this statement: “And straightway one of them ran, and took a
sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave Him
to drink.” <span id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438) Mark presents it
in a similar form: “And one ran, and filled a sponge full of vinegar,
and put it on a reed, and gave Him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us
see whether Elias will come to take Him down.” <span
id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439) Matthew, however, has represented
these words about Elias to have been spoken, not by the person who
offered the sponge with the vinegar, but by the rest. For his version
runs thus: “But the rest said, Let be; let us see whether Elias will
come to save Him;” <span id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440) —from
which, therefore, we infer that both the man specially referred to and
the others who were there expressed themselves in these terms. Luke,
again, has introduced this notice of the vinegar previous to his report
of the robber’s insolence. He gives it thus: “And the soldiers also
mocked Him, coming to Him, and offering Him vinegar, and saying, If thou
be the King of the Jews, save thyself.” <span
id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441) It has been Luke’s purpose to
embrace in one statement what was done and what was said by the
soldiers. And we ought to feel no difficulty in the circumstance that he
has not said explicitly that it was “one” of them who offered the
vinegar. For, adopting a method of expression which we have discussed
above, <span id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442) he has simply put the
plural number for the singular. <span
id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443) Moreover, John has also given us an
account of the vinegar, where he says: “After this, Jesus, knowing that
all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled,
said, I thirst. Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they
filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to His
mouth.” <span id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444) But although the said
John thus informs us that Jesus said “I thirst,” and also mentions that
there was a vessel full of vinegar there, while the other evangelists
leave these things unspecified, there is nothing to marvel at in this.
