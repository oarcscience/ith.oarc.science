<span id="v.iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p2"></span>47. Then, further, the statement which
follows, “No man can serve two masters,” is to be referred to this very
intent, as He goes on to explain, saying: “For either he will hate the
one, and love the other; or else he will <span
id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373) submit to the one, and despise the
other.” And these words are to be carefully considered; for who the two
masters are he forthwith shows, when He says, “Ye cannot serve God and
mammon.” Riches are said to be called mammon among the Hebrews. The
Punic name also corresponds: for gain is called mammon in Punic. <span
id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374) But he who serves mammon certainly
serves him who, as being set over those earthly things in virtue of his
perversity, is called by our Lord the prince of this world. <span
id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375) A man will therefore “either hate”
this one, “and love the other,” *i.e.* God; “or he will submit to the
one, and despise the other.” For whoever serves mammon submits to a hard
and ruinous master: for, being entangled by his own lust, he becomes a
subject of the devil, and he does not love him; for who is there who
loves the devil? But yet he submits to him; as in any large house he who
is connected with another man’s maid servant submits to hard bondage on
account of his passion. even though he does not love him whose
maid-servant he loves.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p6"></span>48. But “he will despise the other,” He
has said; not, he will hate. For almost no one’s conscience can hate
God; but he despises, *i.e.* he does not fear Him, as if feeling himself
secure in consideration of His goodness. From this carelessness and
ruinous security the Holy Spirit recalls us, when He says by the
prophet, “My son, do not add sin upon sin, and say, The mercy of God is
great ;” <span id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376) and, “Knowest thou not
that the patience <span id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377) of God
inviteth <span id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378) thee to
repentance?” <span id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379) For whose mercy can
be mentioned as being so great as His, who pardons all the sins of those
who return, and makes the wild olive a partaker of the fatness of the
olive? and whose severity as being so great as His, who spared not the
natural branches, but broke them off because of unbelief? <span
id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380) But let not any one who wishes to love
God, and to beware of offending Him, suppose that he can serve two
masters; <span id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381) and let him disentangle
the upright intention of his heart from all doubleness: for thus he will
think of the Lord with a good heart, and in simplicity of heart will
seek Him. <span id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382)

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p4"></span> Augustin is the only one to give this
derivation. His residence in North Africa is the explanation of his
knowledge of the Punic. The word probably comes from the Chaldee and
through the Hebrew word *aman*, “what is trusted in.” (See Thayer,
*Lexicon*.)

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p12"></span> Luther says the world can do it in a
masterly way, and carry the tree (or “water” according to the English
figure) on both shoulders. This verse is a rebuke to those who think
they can combine a supreme affection for heavenly and for earthly things
at the same time, and pursue both with equal zeal.
