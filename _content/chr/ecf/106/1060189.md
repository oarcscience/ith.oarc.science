<span id="vi.vi.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Of the Method in Which We Can
Reconcile the Statement Which is Made by Matthew, Mark, and Luke, to the
Effect that Another Person Was Pressed into the Service of Carrying the
Cross of Jesus, with that Given by John, Who Says that Jesus Bore It
Himself.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.xi-p2"></span>37. Matthew, accordingly, goes on with his
narrative in these terms: “And as they came out, they found a man of
Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear His cross.” <span
id="fr_1372"></span>[1373](#fn_1372) In like manner, Mark says: “And
they led Him out to be crucified. And they compelled one Simon, a
Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of
Alexander and Rufus, to bear His cross.” <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373) Luke’s version is also to this
effect: “And as they led Him away, they laid hold upon one Simon a
Cyrenian, coming out of the country; and on him they laid the cross,
that he might bear it after Jesus.” <span
id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374) On the other hand, John records the
matter as follows: “And they took Jesus, and led Him away. And He
bearing His cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull,
which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha; where they crucified
Him.” <span id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375) From all this we
understand that Jesus was carrying the cross Himself as He went forth
into the place mentioned. But on the way the said Simon, who is named by
the other three evangelists, was pressed into the service, and got the
cross to carry for the rest of the course until the spot was reached.
Thus we find that both circumstances really took place; namely, first
the one noticed by John, and thereafter the one instanced by the other
three.

\[This probably implies that the afterpart of the cross was laid upon
Simon, not the whole of it. This obviates the necessity for the
explanation given by Augustin.—R.\]
