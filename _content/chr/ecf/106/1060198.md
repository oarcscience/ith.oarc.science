id="vi.vi.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Of the Rending of the Veil of the
Temple, and of the Question Whether Matthew and Mark Really Harmonize
with Luke with Respect to the Order in Which that Incident Took
Place.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.xx-p2"></span>56. Matthew proceeds thus: “And, behold,
the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
bottom.” <span id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450) Mark’s version is
also as follows: “And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the
top to the bottom.” <span id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451) Luke
likewise gives a statement in similar terms: “And the veil of the temple
was rent in the midst.” <span id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452) He
does not introduce it, however, in the same order. For, with the
intention of attaching miracle to miracle, he has told us first how “the
sun was darkened,” and then has deemed it right to subjoin the said
sentence in immediate succession, namely, “And the veil of the temple
was rent in the midst.” Thus it would appear that he has introduced at
an earlier point this incident, which really took place when the Lord
expired, so as to give us there a summary description of the
circumstances relating to the drinking of the vinegar, and the loud
voice, and the death itself, which are understood to have taken place
previous to the rending of the veil, and after the darkness had come in.
For Matthew has inserted this sentence, “And, behold, the veil of the
temple was rent,” in immediate succession to the statement, “And Jesus,
crying again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost;” and has thus
given us clearly to understand that the time when the veil was rent was
after Jesus had given up His spirit. If, however, he had not added the
words, “And behold,” but had said simply, “And the veil of the temple
was rent,” it would have been uncertain whether Mark and he had narrated
the incident in the form of a recapitulation, while Luke had kept the
exact order, or whether Luke had given the summary account of what these
others had introduced in the correct historical succession.
