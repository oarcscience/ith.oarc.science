<span id="vi.vi.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Of the Harmony Preserved Among
All the Evangelists on the Subject of the Two Robbers Who Were Crucified
Along with Him.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.xv-p2"></span>51. Matthew continues his narrative in the
following terms: “Then were there two robbers crucified with Him, one on
the right hand, and another on the left.” <span
id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421) Mark and Luke give it also in a
similar form. <span id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422) Neither does
John raise any question of difficulty, although he has made no mention
of those robbers. For he says, “And two other with Him, on either side
one,and Jesus in the midst.” <span id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423)
But there would have been a contradiction if John had spoken of these
others as innocent, while the former evangelists called them robbers.
