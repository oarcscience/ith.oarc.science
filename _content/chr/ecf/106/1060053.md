<span id="v.iii.xxiii-p2"></span>77. But because this belongs to few, He
now begins to speak of searching for and possessing wisdom, which is a
tree of life; and certainly, in searching for and possessing, *i.e.*
contemplating this wisdom, such an eye is led through all that precedes
to a point where there may now be seen the narrow way and the strait
gate. When, therefore, He says in continuation, “Enter ye <span
id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456) in at the strait gate: for wide is the
gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there
be which <span id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span
id="v.iii.xxiii-Page_60"></span>go in thereat: because strait is the
gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be
that find it; <span id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457) He does not say so
for this reason, that the Lord’s yoke is rough, or His burden heavy; but
because few are willing to bring their labours to an end, giving too
little credit to Him who cries, “Come unto me, all ye that labour, and I
will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am
meek and lowly in heart: for my yoke is easy, <span
id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458) and my burden <span
id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459) is light” <span
id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460) (hence, moreover, the sermon before us
took as its starting-point the lowly and meek in heart): and this easy
yoke and light burden which many spurn, few submit to; and on that
account the way becomes narrow which leadeth unto life, and the gate
strait by which it is entered.

<span id="v.iii.xxiii-p4"></span> The narrowness of the way is taken to
represent the self-denial and hardships of disciples (Meyer, Mansel,
etc.), or righteousness (Bengel, Schaff, etc.). “The picture is a dark
one, and yet it represents but too faithfully the impression made, I do
not say on Calvinist or true Christian, but on any ethical teacher, by
the actual state of mankind around us. If there is any wider hope, it is
found in hints and suggestions of the possibilities of the future ([1
