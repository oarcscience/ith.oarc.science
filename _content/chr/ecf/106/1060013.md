<span id="v.ii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.</span>

<span id="v.ii.vii-p2"></span>18. “Let your light,” <span
id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66) says He, “so shine before men, that they
may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.” If
He had merely said, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may
see your good works,” He would seem to have fixed an end in the praises
of men, which hypocrites seek, and those who canvass for honours and
covet glory of the emptiest kind. Against such parties it is said, “If I
yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ;”  <span
id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67) and, by the prophet, “They who please men
are put to shame, because God hath despised them;” and again, “God hath
broken the bones of those who please men;” <span
id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68) and again the apostle, “Let us not be
desirous of vainglory;” <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69) and still
another time, “But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he
have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.” <span
id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70) Hence our Lord has not said merely, “that
they may see your good works,” but has added, “and glorify your Father
who is in heaven:” so that the mere fact that a man by means of good
works pleases men, does not there set it up as an end that he should
please men; but let him subordinate this to the praise of God, and for
this reason please men, that God may be glorified in him. For this is
expedient for them who offer praise, that they should honour, not man,
but God; as our Lord showed in the case of the man who was carried,
where, on the paralytic being healed, the multitude, marvelling at His
powers, as it is written in the Gospel, “feared and glorified God, which
had given such power unto men.” <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71) And
His imitator, the Apostle Paul, says, “But they <span id="page_10">p.
10</span> <span id="v.ii.vii-Page_10"></span>had heard only, that he
which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he
destroyed; and they glorified <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72) God
in me.”

<span id="v.ii.vii-p10"></span>19. And therefore, after He has exhorted
His hearers that they should prepare themselves to bear all things for
truth and righteousness, and that they should not hide the good which
they were about to receive, but should learn with such benevolence as to
teach others, aiming in their good works not at their own praise, but at
the glory of God, He begins now to inform and to teach them what they
are to teach; as if they were asking Him, saying: Lo, we are willing
both to bear all things for Thy name, and not to hide Thy doctrine; but
what precisely is this which Thou forbiddest us to hide, and for which
Thou commandest us to bear all things? Art Thou about to mention other
things contrary to those which are written in the law? “No,” says He;
“for think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am
not come to destroy, but to fulfil.”
