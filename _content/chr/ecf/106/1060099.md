<span id="vi.v.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—An Explanation of the Sense in
Which Christ is the Son of David, Although He Was Not Begotten in the
Way of Ordinary Generation by Joseph the Son of David.</span>

<span id="vi.v.iii-p2"></span>4. Thus, too, even if one were able to
demonstrate that no descent, according to the laws of blood, could be
claimed from David for Mary, we should have warrant enough to hold
Christ to be the son of David, on the ground of that same mode of
reckoning by which also Joseph is called His father. But seeing that the
Apostle Paul unmistakably tells us that “Christ was of the seed of David
according to the flesh,” <span id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667) how
much more ought we to accept without any hesitation the position that
Mary herself also was descended in some way, according to the laws of
blood, from the lineage of David? Moreover, since this woman’s
connection with the priestly family also is a matter not left in
absolute obscurity, inasmuch as Luke inserts the statement that
Elisabeth, whom he records to be of the daughters of Aaron, <span
id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668) was her cousin, <span
id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669) we ought most firmly to hold by the
fact that the flesh of Christ sprang from both lines; to wit, from the
line of the kings, and from that of the priests, in the case of which
persons there was also instituted a certain mystical unction which was
symbolically expressive among this people of the Hebrews. In other
words, there was a chrism; which term makes the import of the name of
Christ patent, and presents it as something indicated so long time ago
by an intimation so very intelligible.
