<span id="vii.xcix-p3"></span>*On the same words of the Gospel of* <span
id="vii.xcix-p3.1"></span>*[John. xxi.
15](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015)<span id="vii.xcix-p3.2"></span>,
“Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more than these?” etc.*

<span id="vii.xcix-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.xcix-p4.1"></span>Ye</span> remember that the Apostle Peter, the
first of all the Apostles, was disturbed at the Lord’s Passion. Of his
own self disturbed, but by Christ renewed. For he was first a bold
presumer, and became afterwards a timid denier. He had promised that he
would die for the Lord, when the Lord was first to die for him. When he
said then, “I will be with Thee even unto death,” and “I will lay down
my life for Thee;” the Lord answered him, “Wilt thou lay down thy life
for Me? Verily I say unto thee, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny Me
thrice.” <span id="fr_4321"></span>[4322](#fn_4321) They came to the
hour; and because that Christ was God, and Peter a man, the Scripture
was fulfilled, “I said in my panic, Every man is a liar.” <span
id="fr_4322"></span>[4323](#fn_4322) And the Apostle says, “For God is
true, and every man a liar.” <span id="fr_4323"></span>[4324](#fn_4323)
Christ true, Peter a liar.

<span id="vii.xcix-p8"></span>2. But what now? The Lord asketh him as ye
heard when the Gospel was being read, and saith to him, “Simon, son of
John, lovest thou Me more than these?” He answered and said, “Yea Lord
Thou knowest that I love Thee.” <span
id="fr_4324"></span>[4325](#fn_4324) And again the Lord asked this
question, and a third time He asked it. And when he asserted in reply
his love, He commended to him the flock. For each several time the Lord
Jesus said to Peter, as he said, “I love thee;” “Feed My lambs,” feed My
“little sheep.” In this one Peter was figured the unity of all pastors,
of good pastors, that is, who know that they feed Christ’s sheep for
Christ, not for themselves. Was Peter at this time a liar, or did he
answer untruly that he loved the Lord? He made this answer truly; for he
made answer of that which he saw in his own heart. Whereas when he said,
“I will lay down my life for Thee,” he would presume on future strength.
Now every man knows it may be what sort of man he is at the time when he
is speaking; what he shall be on the morrow, who knows? So then Peter
turned back his eyes to his own heart, when he was asked by the Lord,
and in confidence made answer of what he saw there: “‘Yea, Lord, Thou
knowest that I love Thee.’ What I tell Thee, Thou knowest; what I see
here in my heart, Thou seest also.” Nevertheless, he did not venture to
say what the Lord had asked. For the Lord had not simply said, “Lovest
Thou me?” but had added, “Lovest thou Me more than these?” that is,
“Lovest thou Me more than these here do?” He was speaking of the other
disciples; Peter could not say ought but, “I love Thee;” he did not
venture to say, “more than these.” He would not be a liar a second time.
It were enough for him to bear testimony to his own heart; it was no
duty of his to be judge of the heart of others.

<span id="page_545">p. 545</span> <span id="vii.xcix-Page_545"></span>

<span id="vii.xcix-p10"></span>3. Peter then was true; or rather was
Christ true in Peter? Now when the Lord Jesus Christ would, He abandoned
Peter, and Peter was found a man; but when it so pleased the Lord Jesus
Christ, He filled Peter, and Peter was found true. The Rock (Petra) made
Peter true, for the Rock was Christ. And what did He announce to him,
when he answered a third time that he loved Christ, and a third time the
Lord commended His little sheep to Peter? He announced to him beforehand
his suffering. “When thou wast young,” saith He, “thou girdedst thyself,
and wentest whither thou wouldest; but when thou shalt be old, thou
shalt stretch forth thine hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry
thee whither thou wouldest not.” <span
id="fr_4325"></span>[4326](#fn_4325) The Evangelist hath explained to us
Christ’s meaning. “This spake He,” saith he, “signifying by what death
he should glorify God;” <span id="fr_4326"></span>[4327](#fn_4326) that
is that he was crucified for Christ; for this is, “Thou shalt stretch
forth thine hands.” Where now is that denier? Then after this the Lord
Christ said, “Follow Me.” Not in the same sense as before, when he
called the disciples. For then too He said, “Follow Me;” but then to
instruction, now to a crown. Was he not afraid to be put to death when
he denied Christ? He was afraid to suffer that which Christ suffered.
But now he must be afraid no more. For he saw Him now Alive in the
Flesh, whom he had seen hanging on the Tree. By His Resurrection Christ
took away the fear of death; and forasmuch as He had taken away the fear
of death, with good reason did He enquire of Peter’s love. Fear had
thrice denied, love thrice confessed. The <span
id="fr_4327"></span>[4328](#fn_4327) threefoldness of denial, the
forsaking of the Truth; the threefoldness of confession, the testimony
of love.
