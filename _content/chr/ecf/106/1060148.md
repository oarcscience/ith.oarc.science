<span id="vi.v.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LI.—Of Matthew’s Declaration That, on
Leaving These Parts, He Came into the Coasts of Magedan; And of the
Question as to His Agreement with Mark in that Intimation, as Well as in
the Notice of the Saying About Jonah, Which Was Returned Again as an
Answer to Those Who Sought a Sign.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lii-p2"></span>106. Matthew continues as follows: “And He
sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of
Magedan;” and so on, down to the words, “A wicked and adulterous
generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto
it but the sign of the prophet Jonas.” <span
id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079) This has already been recorded in
another connection by the same Matthew. <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080) Hence again and again we must hold
by the position that the Lord spake the same words on repeated
occasions; so that when any completely irreconcilable difference appears
between statements of His utterances, we are to understand the words to
have been spoken twice over. In this case, indeed, Mark also keeps the
same order; and after his account of the miracle of the seven loaves,
subjoins the same intimation as is given us in Matthew, only with this
difference, that Matthew’s expression for the locality is not
Dalmanutha, as is read in certain codices, but Magedan. <span
id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081) There is no reason, however, for
questioning the fact that it is the same place that is intended under
both names. For most codices, even of Mark’s Gospel, give no other
reading than that of Magedan. <span id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082)
Neither should any difficulty be felt in the fact that Mark does not
say, as Matthew does, that in the answer which the Lord returned to
those who sought after a sign, He referred to Jonah, but mentions simply
that He replied in these terms: “There shall no sign be given unto it.”
For we are given to understand what kind of sign they asked—namely, one
from heaven. And he has simply omitted to specify the words which
Matthew has introduced regarding Jonas.

reads in Matthew, is poorly supported, and was probably substituted by
some ignorant scribe for “Magadan” (comp. Revised Version). In [Mark

attested. Augustin refers to Latin codices.—R.\]
