<span id="vi.v.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIV.—Of the Order in Which the
Accounts of John’s Imprisonment and Death are Given by These Three
Evangelists.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xlv-p2"></span>92. Matthew then proceeds with his
narrative in the following terms: “For Herod laid hold on John, and
bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother’s
wife;” and so on, down to the words, “And his disciples came and took up
the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.” <span
id="fr_1042"></span>[1043](#fn_1042) Mark gives this narrative in
similar terms. <span id="fr_1043"></span>[1044](#fn_1043) Luke, on the
other hand, does not relate it in the same succession, but introduces it
in connection with his statement of the baptism wherewith the Lord was
baptized. Hence we are to understand him to have acted by anticipation
here, and to have taken the opportunity of recording at this point an
event which took place actually a considerable period later. For he has
first reported those words which John spake with regard to the
Lord—namely, that “His fan is in His hand, and that He will thoroughly
purge His floor, and will gather the wheat into His garner; but the
chaff He will burn up with fire unquenchable;” and immediately
thereafter he has appended his statement of an incident which the
evangelist John demonstrates not to have taken place in direct
historical sequence. For this latter writer mentions that, after Jesus
had been baptized, He went into Galilee at the period when He turned the
water into wine; and that, after a sojourn of a few days in Capharnaum,
He left that district and returned to the land of Judæa, and there
baptized a multitude about the Jordan, previous to the time when John
was imprisoned. <span id="fr_1044"></span>[1045](#fn_1044) Now what
reader, unless he were all the better versed <span
id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045) in these writings, would not take
it to be implied here that it was after the utterance of the words with
regard to the fan and the purged floor that Herod became incensed
against John, and cast him into prison? Yet, that the incident referred
to here did not, as matter of fact, occur in the order in which it is
here recorded, we have already shown elsewhere; and, indeed, Luke
himself puts the proof into our hands. <span
id="fr_1046"></span>[1047](#fn_1046) For if \[he had meant that\] John’s
incarceration took place immediately after the utterance of those words,
then what are we to make of the fact <span id="page_147">p. 147</span>
<span id="vi.v.xlv-Page_147"></span>that in Luke’s own narrative the
baptism of Jesus is introduced subsequently to his notice of the
imprisonment of John? Consequently it is manifest that, recalling the
circumstance in connection with the present occasion, he has brought it
in here by anticipation, and has thus inserted it in his history at a
point antecedent to a number of incidents, of which it was his purpose
to leave us some record, and which, in point of time, were antecedent to
this mishap that befell John. But it is as little the case that the
other two evangelists, Matthew and Mark, have placed the fact of John’s
imprisonment in that position in their narratives which, as is apparent
also from their own writings, belonged to it in the actual order of
events. For they, too, have told us how it was on John’s being cast into
prison that the Lord went into Galilee; <span
id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047) and then, after \[relating\] a
number of things which He did in Galilee, they come to Herod’s
admonition or doubt as to the rising again from the dead of that John
whom he beheaded; <span id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048) and in
connection with this latter occasion, they give us the story of all that
occurred in the matter of John’s incarceration and death.
