<p class="c22"><a name="v.iii.xxiii-p2"></A>77. But because this belongs to few, He now begins to speak of searching for and possessing wisdom, which is a tree of life; and certainly, in searching for and possessing, <i> i.e.</i> contemplating this wisdom, such an eye is led through all that precedes to a point where there may now be seen the narrow way and the strait gate. When, therefore, He says in continuation, &#8220;Enter ye&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_456"></A><A HREF="#fn_456"><FONT SIZE="1">457</FONT></A>
 in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which <A NAME="page_60"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 60</FONT></A> <a name="v.iii.xxiii-Page_60"></A>go in thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_457"></A><A HREF="#fn_457"><FONT SIZE="1">458</FONT></A>
 He does not say so for this reason, that the Lord&#146;s yoke is rough, or His burden heavy; but because few are willing to bring their labours to an end, giving too little credit to Him who cries, &#8220;Come unto me, all ye that labour, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: for my yoke is easy,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_458"></A><A HREF="#fn_458"><FONT SIZE="1">459</FONT></A>
 and my burden&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_459"></A><A HREF="#fn_459"><FONT SIZE="1">460</FONT></A>
 is light&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_460"></A><A HREF="#fn_460"><FONT SIZE="1">461</FONT></A>
 (hence, moreover, the sermon before us took as its starting-point the lowly and meek in heart): and this easy yoke and light burden which many spurn, few submit to; and on that account the way becomes narrow which leadeth unto life, and the gate strait by which it is entered.</p>
