<p class="c55"><a name="vii.xxxix-p3"></A><i>Delivered on the Lord&#146;s Day, on that which is written in the Gospel,</i> <a name="vii.xxxix-p3.1"></A><i><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#001">Matt. xx. 1</a><a name="vii.xxxix-p3.2"></A></i><i>, &#8220;The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that was a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.&#8221;</i></p>  		  
<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xxxix-p4"></A>1. <span class="c13"><a name="vii.xxxix-p4.1"></A>Ye</span> have heard out of the Holy Gospel a parable well suited to the present season, concerning the labourers in the vineyard. For now is the time of the material&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2840"></A><A HREF="#fn_2840"><FONT SIZE="1">2841</FONT></A>
 vintage. Now there is also a spiritual vintage, wherein God rejoiceth in the fruit of His vineyard. For we cultivate God, and God cultivateth us.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2841"></A><A HREF="#fn_2841"><FONT SIZE="1">2842</FONT></A>
 But we do not so cultivate God as to make Him any better thereby. For our cultivation is the labour of the heart, not of the hands.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2842"></A><A HREF="#fn_2842"><FONT SIZE="1">2843</FONT></A>
 He cultivateth us as the husbandman doth his field. In then that He cultivateth us, He maketh us better; because so doth the husbandman make his field better by cultivating it, and the very fruit He seeketh in us is, that we may cultivate Him. The culture He exerciseth on us is, that He ceaseth not to root out by His Word the evil seeds from our hearts, to open our heart, as it were, by the plough of His Word, to plant the seed of His precepts, to wait for the fruit of piety. 			 For when we have so received that culture into our heart, as to cultivate Him well, we are not ungrateful to our Husbandman, but render the fruit wherein He rejoiceth. And our fruit doth not make Him the richer, but us the happier.</p>  		  
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxix-p8"></A>2. See then; hear how, as I have said, &#8220;God cultivateth us.&#8221; For that we cultivate God, there is no need to be proved to you. For all men have this on their tongue, that men cultivate God, but the hearer feels a kind of awe, when he hears that God cultivates man; because it is not after the ordinary usage of men to say, that God cultivateth men, but that men cultivate God. We ought therefore to prove to you, that God also doth cultivate men; lest perchance we be 			 thought to have spoken a word contrary to sound doctrine,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2843"></A><A HREF="#fn_2843"><FONT SIZE="1">2844</FONT></A>
 and men dispute in their heart against us, and as not knowing our meaning, find fault with us. I have determined therefore to show you, that God doth also cultivate us; but as I have said already, as a field, that He may make us better. Thus the Lord saith in the Gospel, &#8220;I am the Vine, ye are the branches, My Father is the Husbandman.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2844"></A><A HREF="#fn_2844"><FONT SIZE="1">2845</FONT></A>
 What doth the Husbandman do? I ask you who are husbandmen. I suppose he cultivates his field. If then God the Father be a Husbandman, He hath a field; and His field He cultivateth, and from it He expecteth fruit.</p>  		  
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxix-p11"></A>3. Again, He &#8220;planted a vineyard,&#8221; as the Lord Jesus Christ Himself saith, &#8220;and let it out to husbandmen, who should render Him the fruit in the proper season. And He sent His servants to them to ask for the hire of the vineyard. But they treated them despitefully, and killed some,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2845"></A><A HREF="#fn_2845"><FONT SIZE="1">2846</FONT></A>
 and contemptuously refused to render the fruits. &#8220;He sent others also,&#8221; they suffered the like treatment. And then the House<A NAME="page_374"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 374</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xxxix-Page_374"></A>holder, the Cultivator of His field, and the Planter, and Letter out of His vineyard, said; &#8220;I will send Mine Only Son, it may be they will at least reverence Him.&#8221; And so He saith, &#8220;He sent His Own Son also. They said among themselves, This is the heir, come, let us kill Him, and the inheritance shall be ours. And they 			 killed Him, and cast Him out of the vineyard. When the Lord of the vineyard cometh, what will He do to those wicked husbandmen? They answered, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out His vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render Him the fruits in their seasons.&#8221; The vineyard was planted when the law was given in the hearts of the Jews. The Prophets were sent, seeking fruit, even their good life: the Prophets were treated despitefully by them, and were killed. 			 Christ also was sent, the Only Son of the Householder; and they killed Him who was the Heir, and so lost the inheritance. Their evil counsel turned out contrary to their designs. They killed Him that they might possess the inheritance; and because they killed Him, they lost it.</p>  		  
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxix-p13"></A>4. Ye have just heard too the parable out of the Holy Gospel; that &#8220;the kingdom of heaven is like unto a householder, which went out to hire labourers into His vineyard. He went out in the morning,&#8221; and hired those whom he found, and agreed with them for a denarius as their hire. He &#8220;went out again at the third hour, and found others,&#8221; and brought them to the labour of the vineyard. &#8220;And the sixth and ninth hour he did likewise. He went out also at the 			 eleventh hour,&#8221; near the end of the day, &#8220;and found some idle and standing still, and he said to them, Why stand ye here?&#8221; Why do ye not work in the vineyard? They answered, &#8220;Because no man hath hired us.&#8221; &#8220;Go ye also,&#8221; said He, &#8220;and whatsoever is right I will give you.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2846"></A><A HREF="#fn_2846"><FONT SIZE="1">2847</FONT></A>
 His pleasure was to fix their hire at a denarius. How could they who had only to work one hour dare hope for a denarius? Yet they congratulated themselves in the hope that they should receive something. So then these were brought in even for one hour. At the end of the day he ordered the hire to be paid to all, from the last to the first. Then he began to pay at those who had come in at the eleventh hour, and he commanded a denarius to be given them. When they who had come at 			 the first hour saw that the others had received a denarius, which he had agreed for with themselves &#8220;they hoped that they should have received more:&#8221; and when their turn came, they also received a denarius. &#8220;They murmured against the good man of the house, saying, Behold, thou hast made us who have borne the burning and heat of the day, equal and like to those who have laboured but one hour in the vineyard.&#8221; And &#8220;the good man,&#8221; returning a most just answer to one of them, said, 			 &#8220;Friend, I do thee no wrong;&#8221; that is, &#8220;I have not defrauded thee, I have paid thee what I agreed for with thee. &#8220;I have done thee no wrong,&#8221; for I have paid thee what I agreed for. To this other it is my will not to render a payment, but to bestow a gift. &#8220;Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?&#8221; If I had taken from any one what did not belong to me, rightly I might be blamed, as fraudulent and unjust: if I had not paid any 			 one his due, rightly might I be blamed as fraudulent, and as withholding what belonged to another; but when I pay what is due, and give besides to whom I will, neither can he to whom I owed find fault, and he to whom I gave ought to rejoice the more.&#8221; They had nothing to answer; and all were made equal; &#8220;and the last became first, and the first last;&#8221; by equality&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2847"></A><A HREF="#fn_2847"><FONT SIZE="1">2848</FONT></A>
 of treatment, not by inverting their order. For what is the meaning of, &#8220;the last were first, and the first last&#8221;? That both the first and last received the same.</p>  		  
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxix-p16"></A>5. How is it that he began to pay at the last? Are not all, as we read, to receive together? For we read in another place of the Gospel, that He will say to those whom He shall set on the right hand, &#8220;Come, ye blessed of My Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2848"></A><A HREF="#fn_2848"><FONT SIZE="1">2849</FONT></A>
 If all then are to receive together, how do we understand in this place, that they received first who began to work at the eleventh hour, and they last who were hired at the first hour? If I shall be able so to speak, as to reach your understanding, God be thanked. For to Him ought ye to render thanks, who distributeth to you by me; for nought of my own do I distribute. If ye ask me, for example, which of the two has received first, he who has received after one hour, or he 			 who after twelve hours; every man would answer that he who has received after one hour, has received before him who received after twelve hours. So then though they all received at the same hour, yet because some received after one hour, others after twelve hours, they who received after so short a time are said to have received first. The first righteous men, as Abel, and Noe, called as it were at the first hour, will receive together with us the blessedness of the resurrection. Other 			 righteous men after them, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all of their age, called as it were at the third hour, will receive together with us the blessedness of the resurrection. Other righteous <A NAME="page_375"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 375</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xxxix-Page_375"></A>men, as Moses, and Aaron, and whosoever with them were called as it were at the sixth hour, will receive together with us the blessedness of the resurrection. After them the Holy Prophets, called as it were at the ninth hour, will receive together with us the same blessedness. In the end 			 of the world all Christians, called as it were at the eleventh hour, will receive with the rest the blessedness of that resurrection. All will receive together; but consider those first men, after how long a time do they receive it? If then those first receive after a long time, we after a short time; though we all receive together, yet we seem to have received first, because our hire will not tarry long in coming.</p>  		  
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxix-p18"></A>6. In that hire then shall we be all equal, and the first as the last, and the last as the first; because that denarius is life eternal, and in the life eternal all will be equal. For although through diversity of attainments&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2849"></A><A HREF="#fn_2849"><FONT SIZE="1">2850</FONT></A>
 the saints will shine, some more, some less; yet as to this respect, the gift of eternal life, it will be equal to all. For that will not be longer to one, and shorter to another, which is alike everlasting; that which hath no end will have no end either for thee or me. After one sort in that life will be wedded chastity, after another virgin purity; in one sort there will be the fruit of good works, in another sort the crown of martyrdom.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2850"></A><A HREF="#fn_2850"><FONT SIZE="1">2851</FONT></A>
 One in one sort, and another in another; yet in respect to the living for ever, this man will not live more than that, nor that than this. For alike without end will they live, though each shall live in his own brightness: and the denarius in the parable is that life eternal. Let not him then who has received after a long time murmur against him who has received after a short time. To the first, it is a payment; to the other, a free gift; yet the same thing is given alike to 			 both.</p>  		  
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxix-p21"></A>7. There is also something like this in this present life, and besides that solution of the parable, by which they who were called at the first hour are understood of Abel and the righteous men of his age, and they at the third, of Abraham and the righteous men of his age, and they at the sixth, of Moses and Aaron and the righteous men of their age, and they at the eleventh, as in the end of the world, of all Christians; besides this solution of the parable, the parable 			 may be seen to have an explanation in respect even of this present life. For they are as it were called at the first hour, who begin to be Christians fresh from their mother&#146;s womb; boys are called as it were at the third, young men at the sixth, they who are verging toward old age, at the ninth hour, and they who are called as if at the eleventh hour, are they who are altogether decrepit; yet all these are to receive the one and the same denarius of eternal life.</p>  		  
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxix-p22"></A>8. But, Brethren, hearken ye and understand, lest any put off to come into the vineyard, because he is sure, that, come when he will, he shall receive this denarius. And sure indeed he is that the denarius is promised him; but this is no injunction to put off. For did they who were hired into the vineyard, when the householder came out to them to hire whom he might find, at the third hour for instance, and did hire them, did they say to him, &#8220;Wait, we are not going 			 thither till the sixth hour&#8221;? or they whom he found at the sixth hour, did they say, &#8220;We are not going till the ninth hour&#8221;? or they whom he found at the ninth hour, did they say, &#8220;We are not going till the eleventh? For he will give to all alike; why should we fatigue ourselves more than we need?&#8221; What He was to give, and what He was to do, was in the secret of His own counsel: do thou come when thou art called. For an equal reward is promised to all; but as to this appointed hour of 			 working, there is an important question. For if, for instance, they who are called at the sixth hour, at that age of life that is, in which as in the full heat of noon, is felt the glow of manhood&#146;s years; if they, called thus in manhood, were to say, &#8220;Wait, for we have heard in the Gospel that all are to receive the same reward, we will come at the eleventh hour, when we shall have grown old, and shall still receive the same. Why should we add to our labour?&#8221; it would be answered them 			 thus, &#8220;Art not thou willing to labour now, who dost not know whether thou shalt live to old age? Thou art called at the sixth hour; come. The Householder hath it is true promised thee a denarius, if thou come at the eleventh hour, but whether thou shalt live even to the seventh, no one hath promised thee. I say not to the eleventh, but even to the seventh hour. Why then dost thou put off him that calleth thee, certain as thou art of the reward, but uncertain of the day? Take heed then lest 			 peradventure what he is to give thee by promise, thou take from thyself by delay.&#8221; Now if this may rightly be said of infants as belonging to the first hour, if it may be rightly said of boys as belonging to the third, if it may be rightly said of men in the vigour of life, as in the full-day heat of the sixth hour; how much more rightly may it be said of the decrepit? Lo, already is it the eleventh hour, and dost thou yet stand still, and art thou yet slow to come?</p>  		  
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxix-p23"></A>9. But perhaps the Householder hath not gone out to call thee? If he hath not gone out, what mean our addresses to you? For we are servants of his household, we are sent to hire labourers. Why standest thou still then? Thou hast now ended the number of thy years; hasten after the denarius. For this is the &#8220;going out&#8221; of the Householder, the making himself known; foras<A NAME="page_376"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 376</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xxxix-Page_376"></A>much as he that is in the house is hidden, he is not seen by those who are without; 			 but when he &#8220;goeth out&#8221; of the house, he is seen by those without. So Christ is in secret, as long as He is not known and acknowledged; but when He is acknowledged, He hath gone out to hire labourers. For now He hath come forth from a hidden place, to be known of men: everywhere Christ is known, Christ is preached; all places whatsoever under the heaven proclaim aloud the glory of Christ. He was in a manner the object of derision and contempt among the Jews, He appeared in low estate and 			 was despised. For He hid His Majesty, and manifested His infirmity. That in Him which was manifested was despised, and that which was hidden was not known. &#8220;For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2851"></A><A HREF="#fn_2851"><FONT SIZE="1">2852</FONT></A>
 But is He still to be despised now that He sitteth in heaven, if He were despised when He was hanging on the tree? They who crucified Him wagged their head, and standing before His Cross, as though they had attained the fruit of their cruel rage, they said in mockery, &#8220;If He be the Son of God, let Him come down from the Cross. He saved others, Himself He cannot save.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2852"></A><A HREF="#fn_2852"><FONT SIZE="1">2853</FONT></A>
 He came not down, because He lay hid. For with far greater ease could He have come down from the Cross, who had power to rise again from the grave. He showed forth an example of patience for our instruction. He delayed His power, and was not acknowledged. For He had not then gone out to hire labourers, He had gone out, He had not made Himself known. On the third day He rose again, He showed Himself to His disciples, ascended into heaven, and sent the Holy Ghost on the fiftieth 			 day after the resurrection, the tenth after the ascension. The Holy Ghost who was sent filled all who were in one room, one hundred and twenty men.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2853"></A><A HREF="#fn_2853"><FONT SIZE="1">2854</FONT></A>
 They &#8220;were filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with the tongues of all nations;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2854"></A><A HREF="#fn_2854"><FONT SIZE="1">2855</FONT></A>
 now was the calling manifest, now He went out to hire. For now the power of truth began to be made known to all. For then even one man having received the Holy Ghost, spake by himself with the tongues of all nations. But now in the Church oneness itself, as one man speaks in the tongues of all nations. For what tongue has not the Christian religion reached? to what limits does it not extend? Now is there no one &#8220;who hideth himself from the heat thereof;&#8221;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2855"></A><A HREF="#fn_2855"><FONT SIZE="1">2856</FONT></A>
 and delay is still ventured by him who stands still at the eleventh hour.</p>  		  
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxix-p29"></A>10. It is plain then, my Brethren, it is plain to all, do ye hold it fast, and be sure of it, that whensoever any one turns himself to the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, from a useless&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2856"></A><A HREF="#fn_2856"><FONT SIZE="1">2857</FONT></A>
 or abandoned way of life, all that is past is forgiven him, and as though all his debts were cancelled, a new account is entered into with him. All is entirely forgiven. Let no one be anxious in the thought that there remains anything which is not forgiven him. But on the other hand, let no one rest in a perverse security. For these two things are the death of souls, despair, and perverse hope. For as a good and right hope saveth, so doth a perverse hope deceive. First, 			 consider how despair deceiveth. There are men, who when they begin to reflect on the evils they have done, think they cannot be forgiven; and whilst they think they cannot be forgiven, forthwith they give up their souls to ruin, and perish through despair, saying in their thoughts, &#8220;Now there is no hope for us; for such great sins as we have committed cannot be remitted or pardoned us; why then should we not satisfy our lusts? Let us at least fill up the pleasure of the time present, seeing 			 we have no reward in that which is to come. Let us do what we list, though it be not lawful; that we may at least have a temporal enjoyment, because we cannot&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2857"></A><A HREF="#fn_2857"><FONT SIZE="1">2858</FONT></A>
 attain to the receiving an eternal.&#8221; In saying such things they perish through despair, either before they believe at all, or when Christians already, they have fallen by evil living into any sins and wickednesses. The Lord of the vineyard goeth forth to them, and by the Prophet Ezekial knocketh, and calleth to them in their despair, and as they turn their backs to Him that calleth them. &#8220;In whatsoever day a man shall turn from his most wicked way, I will forget all his 			 iniquities.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2858"></A><A HREF="#fn_2858"><FONT SIZE="1">2859</FONT></A>
 If they hear and believe this voice, they are recovered from despair, and rise up again from that very deep and bottomless gulf, wherein they had been sunk.</p>  		  
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxix-p33"></A>11. But these must fear, lest they fall into another gulf, and they die through a perverse hope, who could not die through despair. For they change their thoughts, which are far different indeed from what they were before, but not less pernicious, and begin again to say in their hearts, &#8220;If in whatever day I turn from my most evil way, the merciful God, as He truly promiseth by the Prophet, will forget all my iniquities, why should I turn to-day and not to-morrow? Let 			 this day pass as yesterday, in excess of guilty pleasure, in the full flow of licentiousness, let it wallow in deadly delights; to-morrow I shall &#145;turn myself,&#146; and there will be an end to it.&#8221; One may answer thee, An end of what? Of mine iniquities, thou wilt say. Well, rejoice indeed, that to-morrow there will be an end of thine iniquities. But what if before to-morrow thine own end shall be? So then thou dost well indeed to rejoice that <A NAME="page_377"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 377</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xxxix-Page_377"></A>God hath promised thee 			 forgiveness for thine iniquities, if thou art converted; but no one has promised thee to-morrow. Or if perchance some astrologer hath promised it, it is a far different thing from God&#146;s promise. Many have these astrologers deceived, in that they have promised themselves advantages, and have found only losses. Therefore for the sake of these again whose hope is wrong, doth the Householder go forth. As He went forth to those who had despaired wrongly, and were lost in their despair, and called 			 them back to hope; so doth He go forth to these also who would perish through an evil hope; and by another book He saith to them, &#8220;Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2859"></A><A HREF="#fn_2859"><FONT SIZE="1">2860</FONT></A>
 As He had said to the others, &#8220;In whatsoever day a man shall turn from his most wicked way, I will forget all his iniquities,&#8221; and took despair away from them, because they had now given up their soul to perdition, despairing of forgiveness by any means; so doth He go forth to these also who have a mind to perish through hope and delay; and speaketh to them, and chideth them, &#8220;Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put not off from day to day; for suddenly shall the 			 wrath of the Lord come forth, and in the day of vengeance He will destroy thee.&#8221; Therefore put not off, shut not against thyself what now is open. Lo, the Giver of forgiveness openeth the door to thee; why dost thou delay? Thou oughtest to rejoice, were He to open after ever so long a time to thy knocking; thou hast not knocked, yet doth He open, and dost thou remain outside? Put not off then. Scripture saith in a certain place, as touching works of mercy, &#8220;Say not, Go, and come again, and 			 to-morrow I will give;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2860"></A><A HREF="#fn_2860"><FONT SIZE="1">2861</FONT></A>
 when thou canst do the kindness at once; for thou knowest not what may happen on the morrow.&#8221; Here then is a precept of not putting off being merciful to another, and wilt thou by putting off be cruel against thine own self? Thou oughtest not to put off to give bread, and wilt thou put off to receive forgiveness? If thou dost not put off in showing pity towards another, &#8220;pity thine own soul also in pleasing God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2861"></A><A HREF="#fn_2861"><FONT SIZE="1">2862</FONT></A>
 Give alms to thine own soul also. Nay I do not say, give to it, but thrust not back His Hand that would give to thee.</p>  		  
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxix-p37"></A>12. But men continually injure themselves exceedingly in their fear to offend others. For good friends have much influence for good, and evil friends for evil. Therefore it was not the Lord&#146;s will to choose first senators, but fishermen, to teach us for our own salvation to disregard the friendship of the powerful. O signal mercy of the Creator! For He knew that had He chosen the senator, he would say, &#8220;My rank has been chosen.&#8221; If He had first made choice of 			 the rich man, he would say, &#8220;My wealth has been chosen.&#8221; If He had first made choice of an emperor, he would say, &#8220;My power has been chosen.&#8221; If the orator he would say, &#8220;My eloquence has been chosen.&#8221; If of the philosopher, he would say, &#8220;My wisdom has been chosen.&#8221; Meanwhile He says, let these proud ones be put off awhile, they swell too much. Now there is much difference between substantial size and swelling; both indeed are large, but both are not alike sound. Let them then, 			 He says, be put off, these proud ones, they must be cured by something solid. First give Me, He says, this fisherman. &#8220;Come, thou poor one, follow Me; thou hast nothing, thou knowest nothing, follow Me. Thou poor and ignorant&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2862"></A><A HREF="#fn_2862"><FONT SIZE="1">2863</FONT></A>
 one, follow Me. There is nothing in thee to inspire awe, but there is much in thee to be filled.&#8221; To so copious a fountain an empty vessel should be brought. So the fisherman left his nets, the fisherman received grace, and became a divine orator. See what the Lord did, of whom the Apostle says, &#8220;God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty, and base things of the world hath God chosen, yea and things which are not, as if they were, 			 that those things which are may be brought to nought.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2863"></A><A HREF="#fn_2863"><FONT SIZE="1">2864</FONT></A>
 And so now the fishermen&#146;s words are read, and the necks of orators are brought down. Let all empty winds then be taken away, let the smoke be taken away which vanishes as it mounts; let them be utterly despised when the question is of this salvation.</p>  		  
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxix-p40"></A>13. If any one in a city had some bodily sickness, and there was in that place some very skilful physician who was an enemy to the sick man&#146;s powerful friends; if any one, I say, in a city were labouring under some dangerous bodily sickness; and there was in the same city a very skilful physician, an enemy as I said, of the sick man&#146;s powerful friends, and they were to say to their friend, &#8220;Do not call him in, he knows nothing;&#8221; and they were to say this not 			 from any judgment of their mind, but through dislike of him; would he not for his own safety&#146;s sake remove from him the groundless assertions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2864"></A><A HREF="#fn_2864"><FONT SIZE="1">2865</FONT></A>
 of his powerful friends, and with whatever offence to them, in order that he might live but a few days longer, call that physician in, whom common report had given out as most skilful to drive away the disease of his body? Well, the whole race of mankind is sick, not with diseases of the body, but with sin. There lies one great patient from East to West throughout the world. To cure this great patient came the Almighty Physician down. He humbled Himself even to mortal flesh, 			 as it were to the sick man&#146;s bed. <A NAME="page_378"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 378</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xxxix-Page_378"></A>Precepts of health He gives, and is despised; they who do observe them are delivered. He is despised, when powerful friends say, &#8220;He knows nothing.&#8221; If He knew nothing, His power would not fill the nations. If He knew nothing, He would not have been, before He was with us. If He knew nothing, He would not have sent the Prophets before Him. Are not those things which were foretold of old, fulfilled now? Does not this Physician 			 prove the power of His art by the accomplishment of His promises? Are not deadly errors overturned throughout the whole world; and by the threshing of the world lusts subdued? Let no one say, &#8220;The world was better aforetime than now; ever since that Physician began to exercise His art, many dreadful things we witness here.&#8221; Marvel not at this? Before that any were in course of healing, the Physician&#146;s residence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2865"></A><A HREF="#fn_2865"><FONT SIZE="1">2866</FONT></A>
 seemed clean of blood; but now rather as seeing what thou dost, shake off all vain delights, and come to the Physician, it is the time of healing, not of pleasure.</p>  		  
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxix-p43"></A>14. Let us then think, Brethren, of being cured. If we do not yet know the Physician, yet let us not like frenzied men be violent against Him, or as men in a lethargy turn away from Him. For many through this violence have perished, and many have perished through sleep. The frenzied are they who are made mad for want of sleep. The lethargic are they who are weighed down by excessive sleep. Men are to be found of both these kinds. Against this Physician it is the 			 will of some to be violent, and forasmuch as He is Himself sitting in heaven, they persecute His faithful ones on earth. Yet even such as these He cureth. Many of them having been converted from enemies have become friends, from persecutors have become preachers. Such as these were the Jews, whom, though violent as men in frenzy against Him while He was here, He healed, and prayed for them as He hung upon the Cross. For He said, &#8220;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.&#8221;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2866"></A><A HREF="#fn_2866"><FONT SIZE="1">2867</FONT></A>
 Yet many of them when their fury was calmed, their frenzy as it were got under, came to know God, and Christ. When the Holy Ghost was sent after the Ascension, they were converted to Him whom they crucified, and as believers drunk in the Sacrament His Blood, which in their violence they shed.</p>  		  
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxxix-p45"></A>15. Of this we have examples. Saul persecuted the members of Jesus Christ, who is now sitting in heaven; grievously did he persecute them in his frenzy, in the loss of his reason, in the transport of his madness. But He with one word, calling to him out of heaven, &#8220;Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2867"></A><A HREF="#fn_2867"><FONT SIZE="1">2868</FONT></A>
 struck down the frantic one, raised him up whole, killed the persecutor, quickened the preacher. And so again many lethargic ones are healed. For to such are they like, who are not violent against Christ, nor malicious against Christians, but who in their delay are only dull and heavy with drowsy words, are slow to open their eyes to the light, and are annoyed with those who would arouse them. &#8220;Get away from me,&#8221; says the heavy, lethargic man, &#8220;I pray thee, get away from 			 me.&#8221; Why? &#8220;I wish to sleep.&#8221; But you will die in consequence. He through love of sleep will answer, &#8220;I wish to die.&#8221; And Love from above calls out &#8220;I do not wish it.&#8221; Often does the son exhibit this loving affection to an aged father, though he must needs die in a few days; and is now in extreme old age. If he sees that he is lethargic, and knows from the physician that he is oppressed with a lethargic complaint, who tells him &#8220;Arouse your father, do not let him sleep, if you 			 would save his life&#8221;! Then will the son come to the old man, and beat, and squeeze, or pinch, or prick him, or give him any uneasiness, and all through his dutiful affection to him; and will not allow him to die at once, die though he soon must from very age; and if his life is thus saved, the son rejoices that he has now to live some few days more with him who must soon depart to make way for him. With how much greater affection then ought we to be importunate&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2868"></A><A HREF="#fn_2868"><FONT SIZE="1">2869</FONT></A>
 with our friends, with whom we may live not a few days in this world, but in God&#146;s presence for ever! Let them then love us, and do what they hear us say, and worship Him, whom we also worship, that they may receive what we also hope for. &#8220;Let us turn to the Lord,&#8221; etc.</p>
