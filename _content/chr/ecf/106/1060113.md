<span id="vi.v.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Of the Temptation of
Jesus.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xvii-p2"></span>33. Matthew proceeds with his narrative
in these terms: “Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the
wilderness, to be tempted of the devil. And when He had fasted forty
days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungered. And when the
tempter came to Him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that
these stones be made bread. But He answered and said, It is written, Man
shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of
the mouth of God. And so the account continues, until we come to the
words, Then the devil left <span id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814) him:
and, behold, angels came and ministered unto Him.” <span
id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815) This whole narrative is given also in
a similar manner by Luke, although not in the same order. And this makes
it uncertain which of the two latter temptations took place first:
whether it was that the kingdoms of the world were shown Him first, and
then that He Himself was taken up to the pinnacle of the temple
thereafter; or whether it was that this latter act occurred first, and
that the other scene followed it. It is, however, a matter of no real
consequence, provided it be clear that all these incidents did take
place. And as Luke sets forth the same events and ideas in different
words, attention need not ever be called to the fact that no loss
results thereby to truth. Mark, again, does indeed attest the fact that
He was tempted of the devil in the wilderness for forty days and forty
nights; but he gives no statement of what was said to Him, or of the
replies He made. At the same time, he does not fail to notice the
circumstance which is omitted by Luke, namely, that the angels
ministered unto Him. <span id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816) John,
however, has left out this whole passage.
