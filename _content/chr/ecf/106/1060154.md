id="vi.v.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVII.—Of the Harmony Between Matthew
and Mark in the Accounts Given of the Occasion on Which He Spoke to the
Disciples Concerning the Coming of Elias.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lviii-p2"></span>115. Matthew goes on thus: “And His
disciples asked Him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must
first come? And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall
first come and restore all things. But I say unto you, that Elias is
come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever
they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. Then the
disciples understood that He spake unto them of John the Baptist.”
 <span id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099) This same passage is given
also by Mark, who keeps also the same order; and although he exhibits
some diversity of expression, he makes no departure from a truthful
representation of the same sense. <span
id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100) He has not, however, added the
statement, that the disciples understood that the Lord had referred to
John the Baptist in saying that Elias was come already.
