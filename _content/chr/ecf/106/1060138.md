<span id="vi.v.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLI.—Of the Words Which Were Spoken
Out of the Ship on the Subject of the Sower, Whose Seed, as He Sowed It,
Fell Partly on the Wayside, Etc.; And Concerning the Man Who Had Tares
Sowed Over and Above His Wheat; And Concerning the Grain of Mustard Seed
and the Leaven; As Also of What He Said in the House Regarding the
Treasure Hid in the Field, and the Pearl, and the Net Cast into the Sea,
and the Man that Brings Out of His Treasure Things New and Old; And of
the Method in Which Matthew’s Harmony with Mark and Luke is Proved Both
with Respect to the Things Which They Have Reported in Common with Him,
and in the Matter of the Order of Narration.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xlii-p2"></span>88. Matthew continues thus: “In that day
went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the seaside: and great
multitudes were gathered together unto Him, so that He went into a ship
and sat, and the whole multitude stood on the shore. And He spake many
things unto them in parables, saying;” and so on, down to the words,
“Therefore every scribe which is instructed in the kingdom of heaven is
like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his
treasure things new and old.” <span id="fr_1024"></span>[1025](#fn_1024)
That the things narrated in this passage took place immediately after
the incident touching the mother and the <span id="page_144">p.
144</span> <span id="vi.v.xlii-Page_144"></span>brethren of the Lord,
and that Matthew has also retained that historical order in his version
of these events, is indicated by the circumstance that, in passing from
the one subject to the other, he has expressed the connection by this
mode of speech: “In that day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the
sea-side; and great multitudes were gathered together unto Him.” For by
adopting this phrase, “in that day” (unless perchance the word “day,” in
accordance with a use and wont of the Scriptures, may signify simply
“time”), he intimates clearly enough either that the thing now related
took place in immediate succession on what precedes, or that much at
least could not have intervened. This inference is confirmed by the fact
that Mark keeps by the same order. <span
id="fr_1025"></span>[1026](#fn_1025) Luke, on the other hand, after his
account of what happened with the mother and the brethren of the Lord,
passes to a different subject. But at the same time, in making that
transition, he does not institute any such connection as bears the
appearance of a want of consistency with this order. <span
id="fr_1026"></span>[1027](#fn_1026) Consequently, in all those passages
in which Mark and Luke have reported in common with Matthew the words
which were spoken by the Lord, there is no questioning their harmony
with one another. Moreover, the sections which are given by Matthew only
are even much more beyond the range of controversy. And in the matter of
the order of narration, although it is presented somewhat differently by
the various evangelists, according as they have proceeded severally
along the line of historical succession, or along that of the succession
of recollection, I see as little reason for alleging any discrepancy of
statement or any contradiction between any of the writers. <span
