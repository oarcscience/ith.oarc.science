<span id="vi.vii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Of the Statement Which John Made
Concerning the Man Who Cast Out Devils Although He Did Not Belong to the
Circle of the Disciples; And of the Lord’s Reply, “Forbid Them Not, for
He that is Not Against You is on Your Part;” And of the Question Whether
that Response Does Not Contradict the Other Sentence, in Which He Said,
“He that is Not with Me is Against Me.”</span>

<span id="vi.vii.vi-p2"></span>6. Mark proceeds as follows: “In those
days again, <span id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602) the multitude
being very great, and having nothing to eat;” and so on, down to the
words, “John answered Him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils
in Thy name, and he followeth not us; and we forbade him. <span
id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603) But Jesus said, Forbid him not; for
there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly
speak evil of me; for he that is not against you is on your side.” <span
id="fr_1604"></span>[1605](#fn_1604) Luke relates this in similar terms,
with this exception, that he does not insert the clause, “for there is
no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil
of me.” Consequently, there is nothing here to raise the question of any
discrepancy between these two. We must see, however, whether this
sentence must be supposed to stand in opposition to another of the
Lord’s sayings, namely, the one to this effect, “He that is not with me
is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth
abroad.” <span id="fr_1605"></span>[1606](#fn_1605) For how was this man
not against Him, who was not with Him, and of whom John reported that he
did not unite with them in following Him, if he is against Him who is
not with Him? Or if the man was against Him, how does He say to the
disciples, “Forbid him not; for he that is not against you is on your
side”? Will any one aver that it is of consequence to observe that here
He says to the disciples, “He that is not against you is on your side;”
whereas, in the other passage, He spoke of Himself in the terms, “He
that is not with me is against me”? That would make it appear, indeed,
as if it were possible for one not to be with Him, although he was
associated with those disciples of His who are, so to speak, His very
members. Besides, how would the truth of such sayings as these stand
then: “He that receiveth you receiveth me;” <span
id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606) and “Inasmuch as ye have done it
unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto
me”? <span id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607) Or is it possible for
one not to be against Him, although he may be against His disciples?
Nay; for what shall we make then of words like these: “He that despiseth
you, despiseth me;” <span id="fr_1608"></span>[1609](#fn_1608) and,
“Inasmuch as ye did it not unto the least of mine, ye did it not unto
me;” <span id="fr_1609"></span>[1610](#fn_1609) and, “Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me,” <span id="fr_1610"></span>[1611](#fn_1610)
—although it was His disciples that Saul was persecuting? But, in good
truth, the sense intended to be conveyed is just this, that, so far as a
man is not with Him, so far is he against Him; and again, that, so far
as a man is not against Him, so far is he with Him. For example, take
this very case of the individual who was working miracles in the name of
Christ, and yet was not in the company of Christ’s disciples: so far as
this man was working miracles in His name, so far was he with them, and
so far he was not against them. <span
id="fr_1611"></span>[1612](#fn_1611) But, inasmuch as they had
prohibited the man from doing a thing in which, so far forth, he was
really with them, the Lord said to them, “Forbid him not.” For what they
ought to have forbidden was what was outside their fellowship, so that
they might bring him over to the unity of the Church, and not a thing
like this, in which he was at one with them, that is to say, so far as
he commended the name of their Master and Lord in the casting out of
devils. And this is the principle on which the Catholic Church acts, not
condemning common sacraments among heretics; for in these they are with
us, and they are not against us. But she condemns and forbids division
and separation, or any sentiment adverse to peace and truth. For therein
they are against us, just because they are not with us in that, and
because, not gathering with us, they are consequently scattering.
