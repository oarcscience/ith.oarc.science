<span id="vi.iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Of the Fact that John Undertook
the Exposition of Christ’s Divinity.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p2"></span>7. These three evangelists, however, were
for the most part engaged with those things which Christ did through the
vehicle of the flesh of man, and after the temporal fashion. <span
id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517) But John, on the other hand, had in
view that true divinity of the Lord in which He is the Father’s equal,
and directed his efforts above all to the setting forth of the divine
nature in his Gospel in such a way as he believed to be adequate to
men’s needs and notions. <span id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518)
Therefore he is borne to loftier heights, in which he leaves the other
three far behind him; so that, while in them you see men who have their
conversation in a certain manner with the man Christ on earth, in him
you perceive one who has passed beyond the cloud in which the whole
earth is wrapped, and who has reached the liquid heaven from which, with
clearest and steadiest mental eye, he is able to look upon God the Word,
who was in the beginning with God, and by whom all things were
made. <span id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519) And there, too, he can
recognise Him who was made flesh in order that He might dwell amongst
us; <span id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520) \[that Word of whom we
say,\] that He assumed the flesh, not that He was changed into the
flesh. For had not this assumption of the <span id="page_80">p.
80</span> <span id="vi.iv.iv-Page_80"></span>flesh been effected in such
a manner as at the same time to conserve the unchangeable Divinity, such
a word as this could never have been spoken,—namely, “I and the Father
are one.” <span id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521) For surely the Father
and the flesh are not one. And the same John is also the only one who
has recorded that witness which the Lord gave concerning Himself, when
He said: “He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father also;” and, “I am
in the Father, and the Father is in me;” <span
id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522) “that they may be one, even as we are
one;” <span id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523) and, “Whatsoever the
Father doeth, these same things doeth the Son likewise.” <span
id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524) And whatever other statements there
may be to the same effect, calculated to betoken, to those who are
possessed of right understanding, that divinity of Christ in which He is
the Father’s equal, of all these we might almost say that we are
indebted for their introduction into the Gospel narrative to John alone.
For he is like one who has drunk in the secret of His divinity more
richly and somehow more familiarly than others, as if he drew it from
the very bosom of his Lord on which it was his wont to recline when He
sat at meat. <span id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525)
