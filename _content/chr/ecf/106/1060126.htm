<p class="c39"><a name="vi.v.xxx-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="vi.v.xxx-p1.1"></A>Chapter XXIX.&#8212;Of the Two Blind Men and the Dumb Demoniac Whose Stories are Related Only by Matthew.</span></p>  			 
<p class="c22"><a name="vi.v.xxx-p2"></A>69. Matthew proceeds with his narrative in the following terms: &#8220;And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed Him, crying and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us;&#8221; and so on, down to the verse where we read, &#8220;But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_958"></A><A HREF="#fn_958"><FONT SIZE="1">959</FONT></A>
 Matthew is the only one who introduces this account of the two blind men and the dumb demoniac. For those two blind men, whose story is given also by the others,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_959"></A><A HREF="#fn_959"><FONT SIZE="1">960</FONT></A>
 are not the two before us here. Nevertheless there is such similarity in the occurrences, that if Matthew himself had not recorded the latter incident as well as the former, it might have been thought that the one which he relates at present has also been given by these other two evangelists. There is this fact, therefore, which we ought to bear carefully in mind,&#8212;namely, that there are some occurrences which resemble each other. For we have a proof of this in the 				circumstance that the very same evangelist mentions both incidents here. And thus, if at any time we find any such occurrences narrated individually by the several evangelists, and discover some contradiction in the accounts, which seems not to admit of being solved [on the principle of harmonizing], it may occur to us that the explanation simply is, that this [apparently contradictory] circumstance did not take place [on that particular occasion], but that what did happen then was only 				something resembling it, or something which was gone about in a similar manner.</p>
