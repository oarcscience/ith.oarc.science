<span id="v.ii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.</span>

<span id="v.ii.ii-p2"></span>4. “Blessed are the meek, for they shall by
inheritance possess <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16) the earth:”
that earth, I suppose, of which it is said in the Psalm, “Thou art my
refuge, my portion in the land of the living.” <span
id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17) For it signifies a certain firmness and
stability of the perpetual inheritance, where the soul, by means of a
good disposition, rests, as it were, in its own place, just as the body
rests on the earth, and is nourished from it with its own food, as the
body from the earth. This is the very rest and life of the saints. Then,
the meek are those who yield to acts of wickedness, and do not resist
evil, but overcome evil with good. <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18)
Let those, then, who are not meek quarrel and fight for earthly and
temporal things; but “blessed are the meek, for they <span
id="page_5">p. 5</span> <span id="v.ii.ii-Page_5"></span>shall by
inheritance possess the earth,” from which they cannot be driven
out. <span id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19)

<span id="v.ii.ii-p7"></span>5. “Blessed are they that mourn: <span
id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20) for they shall be comforted.” Mourning is
sorrow arising from the loss of things held dear; but those who are
converted to God lose those things which they were accustomed to embrace
as dear in this world: for they do not rejoice in those things in which
they formerly rejoiced; and until the love of eternal things be in them,
they are wounded by some measure of grief. Therefore they will be
comforted by the Holy Spirit, who on this account chiefly is called the
Paraclete, *i.e.* the Comforter, in order that, while losing the
temporal joy, they may enjoy to the full that which is eternal. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21)

<span id="v.ii.ii-p10"></span>6. “Blessed are they which do hunger and
thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.” Now He calls
those parties, lovers of a true and indestructible good. They will
therefore be filled with that food of which the Lord Himself says, “My
meat is to do the will of my Father,” which is righteousness; and with
that water, of which whosoever “drinketh,” as he also says, it “shall be
in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting life.”  <span
id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22)

<span id="v.ii.ii-p12"></span>7. “Blessed are the merciful: for they
shall obtain mercy.” <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23) He says that
they are blessed who relieve the miserable, for it is paid back to them
in such a way that they are freed from misery.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p14"></span>8. “Blessed are the pure in heart: <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24) for they shall see God.” How foolish,
therefore, are those who seek God with these outward eyes, since He is
seen with the heart! as it is written elsewhere, “And in singleness of
heart seek Him.” <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25) For that is a pure
heart which is a single heart: and just as this light cannot be seen,
except with pure eyes; so neither is God seen, unless that is pure by
which He can be seen. <span id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26)

<span id="v.ii.ii-p18"></span>9. “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they
shall be called the children of God.” It is the perfection of peace,
where nothing offers opposition; and the children of God are
peacemakers, because nothing resists God, and surely children ought to
have the likeness of their father. Now, they are peacemakers in
themselves who, by bringing in order all the motions of their soul, and
subjecting them to reason—*i.e.* to the mind and spirit—and by having
their carnal lusts thoroughly subdued, become a kingdom of God: in which
all things are so arranged, that that which is chief and pre-eminent in
man rules without resistance over the other elements, which are common
to us with the beasts; and that very element which is pre-eminent in
man, *i.e.* mind and reason, is brought under subjection to something
better still, which is the truth itself, the only-begotten Son of God.
For a man is not able to rule over things which are inferior, unless he
subjects himself to what is superior. And this is the peace which is
given on earth to men of goodwill; <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27)
this the life of the fully developed and perfect wise man. From a
kingdom of this sort brought to a condition of thorough peace and order,
the prince of this world is cast out, who rules where there is
perversity and disorder. <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28) When this
peace has been inwardly established and confirmed, whatever persecutions
he who has been cast out shall stir up from without, he only increases
the glory which is according to God; being unable to shake anything in
that edifice, but by the failure of his machinations making it to be
known with how great strength it has been built from within outwardly.
Hence there follows: “Blessed are they which are persecuted for
righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”

<span id="v.ii.ii-p6"></span> The order in which Augustin places this
Beatitude is followed in *Cod*. D, and approved by Lachmann,
Tischendorf, Neander, and others (not Westcott and Hort). The meek not
only bear provocation, but quietly submit to God’s dealings, and comply
with His designs. The temporal possession promised is one of the few
temporal promises in the New Testament. The inheritance of the earth is
referred to “earthly good and possessions,” by Chrysostom, Euthymius,
Luther, etc.; to conquest of the world by the kingdom of God, by
Neander, to the actual kingdom on this earth, first in its millennial
then in its blessed state, by Alford; typically to the Messiah kingdom,
by Meyer; to the land of the living beyond the heavens by Gregory of
Nyssa. “Humility and meekness have been proved to be a conquering
principle in the world’s history” (Tholuck).

<span id="fn_20"></span>[5:21](1060008.htm#fr_20) <span

<span id="v.ii.ii-p8"></span> *Lugentes*. Greek, <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.ii-p8.1"></span> πενθοῦντες</span>. The
Vulgate, *qui lugent*, which Augustin follows, p. 7.

id="v.ii.ii-p8.2"></span>

<span id="v.ii.ii-p9"></span> The mourning is a mourning over sins of
their own and others (Chrysostom, etc.); too restricted, as is also
Augustin’s explanation. Spiritual mourning in general (Ambrose, Jerome,
Tholuck, etc.) sorrow according to God ([2 Cor. vii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010)<span id="v.ii.ii-p9.1"></span>). We
are helped to the meaning by comparing the woe on those that laugh
([Luke vi. 22](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#022)<span
id="v.ii.ii-p9.2"></span>); that is, upon those who are satisfied with
earthly things, and avoid the seriousness of repentance.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p13"></span> *Ipsorum miserabitur*; closer to the
Greek than the Vulgate *ipsi misericordiam consequentur*. The same
thought that underlies the fifth petition of the Lord’s Prayer, as
Augustin also says, *Retract*. I. xix. 3.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p15"></span> *Mundi corde*; the Vulgate, *mundo
corde*.

id="v.ii.ii-p16.2"></span>

<span id="v.ii.ii-p17"></span> “Pure in heart.” “Ceremonial purity does
not suffice” (Bengel). The singleness of heart which has God’s will for
its aim, and follows integrity with our fellow-men (Tholuck). “Shall see
God:” the most infinite communion with God (Tholuck). The promise is
fulfilled even here (Lange, Alford, Schaff, etc.). It concerns only the
beatific vision in the spiritual body (Meyer). Not a felicity to the
impure to see God (Henry). Comp. [1 John
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002), [Rev.
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#004)<span id="v.ii.ii-p17.1"></span>,
etc. Augustin has a brilliant description of the future vision of God in
*City of God* (this series, vol. ii. pp. 507–509).

<span id="fn_27"></span>[5:28](1060008.htm#fr_27) <span
id="v.ii.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.ii-p19"></span> [Luke ii.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[5:29](1060008.htm#fr_28) <span
id="v.ii.ii-p19.2"></span>

<span id="v.ii.ii-p20"></span> The “peacemakers” not only establish
peace within themselves as Augustin, encouraged by the Latin word,
explains, but diffuse peace around about them,—heal the alienations and
discords of others, and bring about reconciliations in the world; not
merely peaceful, but peacemakers. “In most kingdoms those stand highest
who make war: in the Messiah’s kingdom the crowning beatitude respects
those who make peace.” The expressions will be remembered, “peace of
God” ([Phil. iv. 7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007)<span
id="v.ii.ii-p20.1"></span>); “peace of Christ” ([Col. iii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015)<span id="v.ii.ii-p20.2"></span>);
“God of peace” ([Rom. xv. 33](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#033)<span
id="v.ii.ii-p20.3"></span>), etc. “If the peacemakers are blessed, woe
to the peacebreakers!” (M. Henry).
