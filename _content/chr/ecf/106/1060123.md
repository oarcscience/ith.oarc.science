<span id="vi.v.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—Of the Calling of Matthew, and
of the Question Whether Matthew’s Own Account is in Harmony with Those
of Mark and Luke When They Speak of Levi the Son of Alphaeus.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxvii-p2"></span>59. Matthew next continues his narrative
in the following terms:—“And as Jesus passed forth from thence, He saw a
man named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and He saith unto
him, Follow me. And he arose and followed Him.” <span
id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920) Mark gives this story also, and keeps
the same order, bringing it in after the notice of the healing of the
man who was sick of the palsy. His version runs thus: “And He went forth
again by the sea-side; and all the multitude resorted unto Him, and He
taught them. And as He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphæus sitting
at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose,
and followed Him.” <span id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921) There is no
contradiction here; for Matthew is the same person with Levi. Luke also
introduces this after the story of the healing of the same man who was
sick of the palsy. He writes in these terms: “And after these things He
went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of
custom: and He said unto him, Follow me. And he left all, rose up, and
followed Him.” <span id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922) Now, from this it
will appear to be the most reasonable explanation to say that Matthew
records these things here in the form of things previously passed over,
and now brought to mind. For certainly we must believe that Matthew’s
calling took place before the delivery of the sermon on the mount. For
Luke tells us that on this mountain on that occasion the election was
made of all these twelve, whom Jesus also named apostles, out of the
larger body of the disciples.  <span id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923)

\[This fact shows that the order of Matthew is not chronological.
Indeed, as Augustin goes on, he is led more and more to accept the order
of the other evangelists.—R.\]
