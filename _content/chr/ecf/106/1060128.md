<span id="vi.v.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—Of the Account Given by
Matthew and Luke of the Occasion When John the Baptist Was in Prison,
and Despatched His Disciples on a Mission to the Lord.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxxii-p2"></span>78. Matthew proceeds with his narrative
in the following terms: “And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end
of commanding His twelve disciples, He departed thence to teach and to
preach in their cities. Now, when John had heard in the prison the works
of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, and said unto Him, Art thou He
that should come, or do we look for another?” and so on, until we come
to the words, “And Wisdom is justified of her children.”  <span
id="fr_990"></span>[991](#fn_990) This whole section relating to John
the Baptist, touching the message which he sent to Jesus, and the tenor
of the reply which those whom he despatched received, and the terms in
which the Lord spoke of John after the departure of these persons, is
introduced also by Luke. <span id="fr_991"></span>[992](#fn_991) The
order, however, is not the same. But it is not made clear which of them
gives the order of his own recollections, and which keeps by the
historical succession of the things themselves. <span
