id="vi.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Of the Two Herods.</span>

<span id="vi.v.viii-p2"></span>20. But with respect to the mention of
Herod, it is well understood that some are apt to be in<span
id="page_114">p. 114</span> <span
id="vi.v.viii-Page_114"></span>fluenced by the circumstance that Luke
has told us how, in the days of John’s baptizing, and at the time when
the Lord, being then a grown man, was also baptized, Herod was tetrarch
of Galilee; <span id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776) whereas Matthew
tells us that the boy <span id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777) Jesus
returned from Egypt after the death of Herod. Now these two accounts
cannot both be true, unless we may also suppose that there were two
different Herods. But as no one can fail to be aware that this is a
perfectly possible case, what must be the blindness in which those
persons pursue their mad follies, who are so quick to launch false
charges against the truth of the Gospels; and how miserably
inconsiderate must they be, not to reflect that two men may have been
called by the same name? Yet this is a thing of which examples abound on
all sides. For this latter Herod is understood to have been the son of
the former Herod: just as Archelaus also was, whom Matthew states to
have succeeded to the throne of Judæa on the death of his father; and as
Philip was, who is introduced by Luke as the brother of Herod the
tetrarch, and as himself tetrarch of Ituræa. For the Herod who sought
the life of the child Christ was king; whereas this other Herod, his
son, was not called king, but tetrarch, which is a Greek word,
signifying etymologically one set over the fourth part of a kingdom.
