<span id="vi.v.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.—Of the Question as to the Manner
of Matthew’s Agreement with Luke in the Accounts Which are Given of the
Lord’s Reply to Certain Persons Who Sought a Sign, When He Spoke of
Jonas the Prophet, and of the Ninevites, and of the Queen of the South,
and of the Unclean Spirit Which, When It Has Gone Out of the Man,
Returns and Finds the House Garnished.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xl-p2"></span>86. Matthew goes on and relates what
followed thus: “Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees
answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign of thee;” and so on, down
to where we read, “Even so shall it be also unto this wicked
generation.” <span id="fr_1015"></span>[1016](#fn_1015) These words are
recorded also by Luke in this connection, although in a somewhat
different order. <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1017](#fn_1016) For he has
mentioned the fact that they sought of the Lord a sign from heaven at an
earlier point in his narrative, which makes it follow immediately on his
version of the miracle wrought on the dumb man. He has not, however,
recorded there the reply which was given to them by the Lord. But
further on, after \[telling us how\] the people were gathered together,
he states that this answer was returned to the persons who, as he gives
us to understand, were mentioned by him in those earlier verses as
seeking of Him a sign from heaven. And that reply he also subjoins, only
after introducing the passage regarding the woman who said to the Lord,
“Blessed is the womb that bare thee.” <span
id="fr_1017"></span>[1018](#fn_1017) This notice of the woman, moreover,
he inserts after relating the Lord’s discourse concerning the unclean
spirit that goes out of the man, and then returns and finds the house
garnished. In this way, then, after the notice of the woman, and after
his statement of the reply which was made to the multitudes on the
subject of the sign which they sought from heaven, he brings in the
similitude of the prophet Jonas; and then, directly continuing the
Lord’s discourse, he next instances what was said concerning the Queen
of the South and the Ninevites. Thus he has rather related something
which Matthew has passed over in silence, than omitted any of the facts
which that evangelist has narrated in this place. And furthermore, who
can fail to perceive that the question as to the precise order in which
these words were uttered by the Lord is a superfluous one? For this
lesson also we ought to learn, on the unimpeachable authority of the
evangelists,—namely, that no offence against truth need be supposed on
the part of a writer, although he may not reproduce the discourse of
some speaker in the precise order in which the person from whose lips it
proceeded might have given it; the fact being, that the mere item of the
order, whether it be this or that, does not affect the subject-matter
itself. And by his present version Luke indicates that this discourse of
the Lord was of greater length than we might otherwise have supposed;
and he records certain topics handled in it, which resemble those which
are mentioned by Matthew in his recital of the sermon which was
delivered on the mount. <span id="fr_1018"></span>[1019](#fn_1018) So
that we take these words to have been spoken twice over, to wit, on that
previous occasion, and <span id="page_143">p. 143</span> <span
id="vi.v.xl-Page_143"></span>again on this one. But on the conclusion of
this discourse Luke proceeds to another subject, as to which it is
uncertain whether, in the account which he gives of it, he has kept by
the order of actual occurrence. For he connects it in this way: “And as
He spake, a certain Pharisee besought Him to dine with him.” <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[1020](#fn_1019) He does not say, however, “as He
spake these words,” but only “as He spake.” For if he had said, “as He
spake these words,” the expression would of course have compelled us to
suppose that the incidents referred to, besides being recorded by him in
this order, also took place on the Lord’s part in that same order.
