<span id="v.ii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.ii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.</span>

<span id="v.ii.viii-p2"></span>20. In this sentence the meaning is
twofold. <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73) We must deal with it in
both ways. For He who says, “I am not come <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74) to destroy the law, but to fulfil,” means
it either in the way of adding what is wanting, or of doing what is in
it. Let us then consider that first which I have put first: for he who
adds what is wanting does not surely destroy what he finds, but rather
confirms it by perfecting it; and accordingly He follows up with the
statement, “Verily I say unto you, <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75)
Till heaven and earth pass, one iota or one tittle shall in nowise pass
from the law, till all be fulfilled.” For, if even those things which
are added for completion are fulfilled, much more are those things
fulfilled which are sent in advance as a commencement. Then, as to what
He says, “One iota or one tittle shall in nowise pass from the law,”
nothing else can be understood but a strong expression of perfection,
since it is pointed out by means of single letters, among which letters
“iota” is smaller than the others, for it is made by a single stroke;
while a “tittle” is but a particle of some sort at the top of even that.
And by these words He shows that in the law all the smallest particulars
even are to be carried into effect. <span id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76)
After that He subjoins: “Whosoever, therefore, shall break one of these
least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least
in the kingdom of heaven.” Hence it is the least commandments that are
meant by “one iota” and “one tittle.” And therefore, “whosoever shall
break and shall teach \[men\] so,”—*i.e.* in accordance with what he
breaks, not in accordance with what he finds and reads,—“shall be called
the least in the kingdom of heaven;” and therefore, perhaps, he will not
be in the kingdom of heaven at all, where only the great can be. “But
whosoever shall do and teach \[men\] so,” <span
id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77) —*i.e.* who shall not break, and shall
teach men so, in accordance with what he does not break,—“shall be
called great in the kingdom of heaven.” But in regard to him who shall
be called great in the kingdom of heaven, it follows that he is also in
the kingdom of heaven, into which the great are admitted: for to this
what follows refers.

<span id="v.ii.viii-p3"></span> Here begins the second part of the
Sermon. In it our Lord sets forth His relation as a lawgiver to the
Mosaic law, especially as currently interpreted according to the letter
only (Meyer, Alford etc.).

<span id="v.ii.viii-p5"></span> A decisive assertion of authority.
*Asseveratio gravissima ei propria, qui per se ipsum et per suam
veritatem asseverat* (Bengel). The prophet’s most emphatic statement
was, “Thus saith the Lord.” Christ speaks in His own name, as the fount
of authority ([John 5.20](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#020)<span
id="v.ii.viii-p5.1"></span> and often: [John
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003), [John
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#012)<span
id="v.ii.viii-p5.2"></span>, etc.).

<span id="fn_76"></span>[10:77](1060014.htm#fr_76) <span
id="v.ii.viii-p5.3"></span>

<span id="v.ii.viii-p6"></span> “Christ’s words are decisive against all
those who would set aside the Old Testament as without significance, or
inconsistent with the New Testament” (Alford). Christ declares the New
to be rooted in the Old; its consummation, not its destruction. The
essence and purport of the law, the “whole law,” was fulfilled by Him
(Meyer). Theophylact well compares the law to a sketch, which Christ
(like the painter) does not destroy, but fills out.
