<span id="vi.iv.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.iv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Of the Fact That, as the
Prophecies Have Been Fulfilled, the God of Israel Has Now Been Made
Known Everywhere.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxx-p2"></span>46. Thus it was with a certain person
named Lucan, one of their great declaimers in verse. For a long time, as
I believe, he endeavored to find out, by his own cogitations, or by the
perusal of the books of his own fellow-countrymen, <span
id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628) who the God of the Jews was; and
failing to prosecute his inquiry in the way of piety, he did not
succeed. Yet he chose rather to speak of Him as the uncertain God whom
he did not find out, than absolutely to deny the title of God to that
Deity of whose existence he perceived proofs so great. For he says:

<span id="vi.iv.xxx-p4"></span>“And Judæa, devoted to the worship

<span id="vi.iv.xxx-p5"></span>Of an uncertain God.” <span
id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629)

<span id="vi.iv.xxx-p8"></span>—<span class="c13"><span
id="vi.iv.xxx-p8.1"></span>Lucan</span>, Book ii. towards the end.

<span id="vi.iv.xxx-p9"></span>And as yet this God, the holy and true
God of Israel, had not done by the name of Christ among all nations
works so great as those which have been wrought after Lucan’s times up
to our own day. But now who is so obdurate as not to be moved, who so
dull <span id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630) as not to be inflamed,
seeing that the saying of Scripture is fulfilled, “For there is not one
that is hid from the heat thereof;” <span
id="fr_631"></span>[632](#fn_631) and seeing also that those other
things which were predicted so long time ago in this same Psalm from
which I have cited one little verse, are now set forth in their
accomplishment in the clearest light? For under this term of the
“heavens” the apostles of Jesus Christ were denoted, because God was to
preside in them with a view to the publishing of the gospel. Now,
therefore, the heavens have declared the glory of God, and the firmament
has proclaimed the works of His hands. Day unto day has given forth
speech, and night unto night has shown knowledge. Now there is no speech
or language where their voices are not heard. Their sound has gone out
into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. Now hath He
set His tabernacle in the sun, that is, in manifestation; which
tabernacle is His Church. For in order to do so (as the words proceed in
the passage) He came forth from His chamber like a bridegroom; that is
to say, the Word, wedded with the flesh of man, came forth from the
Virgin’s womb. Now has He rejoiced as a strong man, and has run His
race. Now has His going forth been made from the height of heaven, and
His return even to the height of heaven. <span
id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632) And accordingly, with the completest
propriety, there follows upon this the verse which I have already
mentioned: “And there is not one that is hid from the heat thereof \[or,
His heat\].” And still these men make choice of their little, weak,
prating objections, which are like stubble to be reduced to ashes in
that fire, rather than like gold to be purged of its dross by it; while
at once the fallacious monuments of their false gods have been brought
to nought, and the veracious promises of that uncertain God have been
proved to be sure.
