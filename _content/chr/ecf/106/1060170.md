<span id="vi.v.lxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.lxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXIII.—Of the Person to Whom the
Two Precepts Concerning the Love of God and the Love of Our Neighbour
Were Commended; And of the Question as to the Order of Narration Which
is Observed by Matthew and Mark, and the Absence of Any Discrepancy
Between Them and Luke.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lxxiv-p2"></span>141. Matthew then proceeds with his
narrative in the following terms: “But when the Pharisees had heard that
He had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together. And
one of them, which was a lawyer, asked Him a question, tempting Him, and
saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said
unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great
commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the
prophets.” <span id="fr_1167"></span>[1168](#fn_1167) This is recorded
also by Mark, and that too in the same order. Neither should there be
any difficulty in the statement made by Matthew, to the effect that the
person by whom the question was put to the Lord tempted Him; whereas
Mark <span id="fr_1168"></span>[1169](#fn_1168) says nothing about that,
but tells us at the end of the paragraph how the Lord said to the man,
as to one who answered discreetly, “Thou art not far from the kingdom of
God.” For it is quite possible that, although the man approached Him
with the view of tempting Him, he may have been set right by the Lord’s
response. Or we need not at any rate take the tempting referred to in a
bad sense, as if it were the device of one who sought to deceive an
adversary; but we may rather suppose it to have been the result of
caution, as if it were the act of one who wished to have further trial
of a person who was unknown to him. For it is not without a good purpose
that this sentence has been written, “He that is hasty to give credit is
light-minded, and shall be impaired.” <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[1170](#fn_1169)

<span id="vi.v.lxxiv-p6"></span>142. Luke, on the other hand, not indeed
in this order, but in a widely different connection, introduces
something which resembles this. <span
id="fr_1170"></span>[1171](#fn_1170) But whether in that passage he is
actually recording this same incident, or whether the person with whom
the Lord \[is represented to have\] dealt in a similar manner there on
the subject of those two commandments is quite another individual, is
altogether uncertain. At the same time, it may appear right to regard
the person who is introduced by Luke as a different individual from the
one before us here, not only on the ground of the remarkable divergence
in the order of narration, but also because he is there reported to have
replied to a question which was addressed to him by the Lord, and in
that reply to have himself mentioned those two precepts. The same
opinion is further confirmed by the fact that, after telling us how the
Lord said to him, “This do, and thou shall live,”—thus instructing him
to do that great thing which, according to his own answer, was contained
in the law,—the evangelist follows up what had passed with the
statement, “But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who
is my neighbour?” <span id="fr_1171"></span>[1172](#fn_1171) Thereupon,
too \[according to Luke\], the Lord told the story of the man who was
going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers.
Consequently, considering that this individual is described at the
outset as tempting Christ, and is represented to have repeated the two
commandments in his reply; and considering, further, that after the
counsel which was given by the Lord in the words, “This do, and thou
shalt live,” he is not commended as good, but, on the contrary, has this
said of him, “But he, willing to justify himself,” etc., whereas the
<span id="page_166">p. 166</span> <span
id="vi.v.lxxiv-Page_166"></span>person who is mentioned in parallel
order both by Mark and by Luke received a commendation so marked, that
the Lord spake to him in these terms, “Thou art not far from the kingdom
of God,”—the more probable view is that which takes the person who
appears on that occasion to be a different individual from the man who
comes before us here.
