<p class="c49"><a name="x.ii.ii.xxiv-p1"></A>  XXIII. <i>That he who confesses the beginning of the world&#146;s existence must necessarily also agree as to its end</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1704"></A><A HREF="#fn_1704"><FONT SIZE="1">1706</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p class="c12"><a name="x.ii.ii.xxiv-p3"></A>But if some one, beholding the present course of the world, by which intervals of time are marked, going on in a certain order, should say that it is not possible that the predicted stoppage of these moving things should take place, such a man clearly also does not believe that in the beginning the heaven and the earth were made by God; for he who admits a beginning of motion surely does not doubt as to its also having an end; and he who does not allow its end, does not admit its beginning either; but as it is by believing that &#8220;we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God,&#8221; as the apostle says, &#8220;so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1705"></A><A HREF="#fn_1705"><FONT SIZE="1">1707</FONT></A>
,&#8221; we must use the same faith as to the word of God when He foretells the necessary stoppage of existing things.</p>  
<p class="c14"><a name="x.ii.ii.xxiv-p5"></A>2. The question of the &#8220;how&#8221; must, however, be put beyond the reach of our meddling; for even in the case mentioned it was &#8220;by faith&#8221; that we admitted that the thing seen was framed from things not yet apparent, omitting the search into things beyond our reach. And yet our reason suggests difficulties on many points, offering no small occasions for doubt as to the things which we believe.</p>  
<p class="c14"><a name="x.ii.ii.xxiv-p6"></A>3. For in that case too, argumentative men might by plausible reasoning upset our faith, so that we should not think that statement true which Holy Scripture delivers concerning the material creation, when it asserts that all existing things have their beginning of being from God. For those who abide by the contrary view maintain that matter is co-eternal with God, and employ in support of their own doctrine some such arguments as these. If God is in His nature simple and immaterial, without quantity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1706"></A><A HREF="#fn_1706"><FONT SIZE="1">1708</FONT></A>
, or size, or combination, and removed from the idea of circumscription by way of figure, while all matter is apprehended in extension measured by intervals, and does not escape the apprehension of our senses, but becomes known to us in colour, and figure, and bulk, and size, and resistance, and the other attributes belonging to it, none of which it is possible to conceive in the Divine nature,&#8212;what method is there for the production of matter from the immaterial, or of the nature that has dimensions from that which is unextended? for if these things are believed to have their existence from that source, they clearly come into existence after being in Him in some mysterious way; but if material existence was in Him, how can He be immaterial while including matter in Himself? and similarly with all the other marks by which the material nature is differentiated; if quantity exists in God, how is God without quantity? if the compound nature exists in Him, how is He simple, without parts and without combination? so that the argument forces us to think either that He is material, because matter has its existence from Him as a source; or, if one avoids this, it is necessary to suppose that matter was imported by Him <i>ab extra</i> for the making of the universe.</p>  
<p class="c14"><a name="x.ii.ii.xxiv-p8"></A>4. If, then, it was external to God, something else surely existed besides God, conceived, in respect of eternity, together with Him Who exists ungenerately; so that the argument supposes two eternal and unbegotten existences, having their being concurrently with each other<A NAME="page_414"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 414</FONT></A> <a name="x.ii.ii.xxiv-Page_414"></A>&#8212;that of Him Who operates as an artificer, and that of the thing which admits this skilled operation; and if any one under pressure of this argument should assume a material substratum for the Creator of all things, what a support will the Manich&aelig;an find for his special doctrine, who opposes by virtue of ungenerateness a material existence to a Good Being. Yet we do believe that all things are of God, as we hear the Scripture say so; and as to the question how they were in God, a question beyond our reason, we do not seek to pry into it, believing that all things are within the capacity of God&#146;s power&#8212;both to give existence to what is not, and to implant qualities at His pleasure in what is.</p>  
<p class="c14"><a name="x.ii.ii.xxiv-p9"></A>5. Consequently, as we suppose the power of the Divine will to be a sufficient cause to the things that are, for their coming into existence out of nothing, so too we shall not repose our belief on anything beyond probability in referring the World-Reformation to the same power. Moreover, it might perhaps be possible, by some skill in the use of words, to persuade those who raise frivolous objections on the subject of matter not to think that they can make an unanswerable attack on our statement.</p>
