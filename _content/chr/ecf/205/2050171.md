<span id="ix.ii.ii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.</span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.xxii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is perfectly clear that no one
can come near the purity of the Divine Being who has not first himself
become such; he must therefore place between himself and the pleasures
of the senses a high strong wall of separation, so that in this his
approach to the Deity the purity of his own heart may not become soiled
again. Such an impregnable wall will be found in a complete estrangement
from everything wherein passion operates.

<span id="ix.ii.ii.xxii-p3"></span>Now pleasure is one in kind, as we
learn from the experts; as water parted into various channels from one
single fountain, it spreads itself over the pleasure-lover through the
various avenues of the senses; so that it has been on his heart that the
man, who through any one particular sensation succumbs to the resulting
pleasure, has received a wound from that sensation. This accords with
the teaching given from the Divine lips, that “he who has satisfied the
lust of the eyes has received the mischief already in his heart <span
id="fr_1493"></span>[1495](#fn_1493) ”; for I take it that our Lord was
speaking in that particular example of any of the senses; so that we
might well carry on His saying, and add, “He who hath heard, to lust
after,” and what follows, “He who hath touched to lust after,” “He who
hath lowered any faculty within us to the service of pleasure, hath
sinned in his heart.”

<span id="ix.ii.ii.xxii-p5"></span>To prevent this, then, we want to
apply to our own lives that rule of all temperance, never to let the
mind dwell on anything wherein pleasure’s bait is hid; but above all to
be specially watchful against the pleasure of taste. For that seems in a
way the most deeply rooted, and to be the mother as it were of all
forbidden enjoyment. The pleasures of eating and drinking, leading to
boundless excess, inflict upon the body the doom of the most <span
id="page_367">p. 367</span> <span
id="ix.ii.ii.xxii-Page_367"></span>dreadful sufferings <span
id="fr_1494"></span>[1496](#fn_1494) ; for over-indulgence is the parent
of most of the painful diseases. To secure for the body a continuous
tranquillity, unstirred by the pains of surfeit, we must make up our
minds to a more sparing regimen, and constitute the need of it on each
occasion not the pleasure of it, as the measure and limit of our
indulgence. If the sweetness will nevertheless mingle itself with the
satisfaction of the need (for hunger knows how to sweeten
everything <span id="fr_1495"></span>[1497](#fn_1495) , and by the
vehemence of appetite she gives the zest of pleasure to every
discoverable supply of the need), we must not because of the resulting
enjoyment reject the satisfaction, nor yet make this latter our leading
aim. In everything we must select the expedient quantity, and leave
untouched what merely feasts the senses <span
id="fr_1496"></span>[1498](#fn_1496) .
