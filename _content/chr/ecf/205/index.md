### Dogmatic Treatises.

[Dogmatic Treatises.](2050012)  
[Against Eunomius.](2050013)  
[Letter I](2050014)  
[To his most pious brother Gregory. Peter greeting in the
Lord.](2050015)  
[Book I](2050016)  
[Section 1](2050017)  
[We have been justly provoked to make this Answer, being stung by
Eunomius' accusations of our brother.](2050018)  
[We see nothing remarkable in logical force in the treatise of Eunomius,
and so embark on our Answer with a just confidence.](2050019)  
[Eunomius displays much folly and fine writing, but very little
seriousness about vital points.](2050020)  
[His peculiar caricature of the bishops, Eustathius of Armenia and Basil
of Galatia, is not well drawn.](2050021)  
[A notice of Aetius, Eunomius' master in heresy, and of Eunomius
himself, describing the origin and avocations of each.](2050022)  
[Eunomius himself proves that the confession of faith which He made was
not impeached.](2050023)  
[Facts show that the terms of abuse which he has employed against Basil
are more suitable for himself.](2050024)  
[In charging Basil with not defending his faith at the time of the
'Trials,' he lays himself open to the same charge.](2050025)  
[All his insulting epithets are shewn by facts to be false.](2050026)  
[The sophistry which he employs to prove our acknowledgment that he had
been tried, and that the confession of his faith had not been
unimpeached, is feeble.](2050027)  
[His charge of cowardice is baseless: for Basil displayed the highest
courage before the Emperor and his Lord-Lieutenants.](2050028)  
[Résumé of his dogmatic teaching. Objections to it in
detail.](2050029)  
[He did wrong, when mentioning the Doctrines of Salvation, in adopting
terms of his own choosing instead of the traditional terms Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit.](2050030)  
[He does wrong in making the being of the Father alone proper and
supreme, implying by his omission of the Son and the Spirit that theirs
is improperly spoken of, and is inferior.](2050031)  
[Examination of the meaning of 'subjection:' in that he says that the
nature of the Holy Spirit is subject to that of the Father and the Son.
It is shewn that the Holy Spirit is of an equal, not inferior, rank to
the Father and the Son.](2050032)  
[Discussion as to the exact nature of the 'energies' which, this man
declares, 'follow' the being of the Father and of the Son.](2050033)  
[He has no reason for distinguishing a plurality of beings in the
Trinity. He offers no demonstration that it is so.](2050034)  
[His acknowledgment that the Divine Being is 'single' is only
verbal.](2050035)  
[He does wrong in assuming, to account for the existence of the
Only-Begotten, an 'energy' that produced Christ's Person.](2050036)  
[The blasphemy of these heretics is worse than the Jewish
unbelief.](2050037)  
[He has no right to assert a greater and less in the Divine being. A
systematic statement of the teaching of the Church.](2050038)  
[These doctrines of our Faith witnessed to and confirmed by Scripture
passages.](2050039)  
[His elaborate account of degrees and differences in 'works' and
'energies' within the Trinity is absurd.](2050040)  
[He who asserts that the Father is 'prior' to the Son with any thought
of an interval must perforce allow that even the Father is not without
beginning.](2050041)  
[It will not do to apply this conception, as drawn out above, of the
Father and Son to the Creation, as they insist on doing: but we must
contemplate the Son apart with the Father, and believe that the Creation
had its origin from a definite point.](2050042)  
[He falsely imagines that the same energies produce the same works, and
that variation in the works indicates variation in the
energies.](2050043)  
[He falsely imagines that we can have an unalterable series of
harmonious natures existing side by side.](2050044)  
[He vainly thinks that the doubt about the energies is to be solved by
the beings, and reversely.](2050045)  
[There is no Word of God that commands such investigations: the
uselessness of the philosophy which makes them is thereby
proved.](2050046)  
[The observations made by watching Providence are sufficient to give us
the knowledge of sameness of Being.](2050047)  
[His dictum that 'the manner of the likeness must follow the manner of
the generation' is unintelligible.](2050048)  
[He declares falsely that 'the manner of the generation is to be known
from the intrinsic worth of the generator'.](2050049)  
[The Passage where he attacks the ῾Ομοούσιον, and the contention in
answer to it.](2050050)  
[Proof that the Anomœan teaching tends to Manichæism.](2050051)  
[A passing repetition of the teaching of the Church.](2050052)  
[Defence of S. Basil's statement, attacked by Eunomius, that the terms
'Father' and 'The Ungenerate' can have the same meaning.](2050053)  
[Several ways of controverting his quibbling syllogisms.](2050054)  
[Answer to the question he is always asking, “Can He who is be
begotten?”](2050055)  
[His unsuccessful attempt to be consistent with his own statements after
Basil has confuted him.](2050056)  
[The thing that follows is not the same as the thing that it
follows.](2050057)  
[Explanation of 'Ungenerate,' and a 'study' of Eternity.](2050058)  
[Book II](2050059)  
[Section 1](2050060)  
[Gregory then makes an explanation at length touching the eternal
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.](2050061)  
[Gregory proceeds to discuss the relative force of the unnameable name
of the Holy Trinity and the mutual relation of the Persons, and moreover
the unknowable character of the essence, and the condescension on His
part towards us, His generation of the Virgin, and His second coming,
the resurrection from the dead and future retribution.](2050062)  
[He next skilfully confutes the partial, empty and blasphemous statement
of Eunomius on the subject of the absolutely existent.](2050063)  
[He next marvellously overthrows the unintelligible statements of
Eunomius which assert that the essence of the Father is not separated or
divided, and does not become anything else.](2050064)  
[He then shows the unity of the Son with the Father and Eunomius' lack
of understanding and knowledge in the Scriptures.](2050065)  
[Gregory further shows that the Only-Begotten being begotten not only of
the Father, but also impassibly of the Virgin by the Holy Ghost, does
not divide the substance; seeing that neither is the nature of men
divided or severed from the parents by being begotten, as is ingeniously
demonstrated from the instances of Adam and Abraham.](2050066)  
[He further very appositely expounds the meaning of the term
“Only-Begotten,“ and of the term “First born,“ four times used by the
Apostle.](2050067)  
[Gregory again discusses the generation of the Only-Begotten, and other
different modes of generation, material and immaterial, and nobly
demonstrates that the Son is the brightness of the Divine glory, and not
a creature.](2050068)  
[He explains the phrase “The Lord created Me,” and the argument about
the origination of the Son, the deceptive character of Eunomius'
reasoning, and the passage which says, “My glory will I not give to
another,” examining them from different points of view.](2050069)  
[After expounding the high estate of the Almighty, the Eternity of the
Son, and the phrase “being made obedient,” he shows the folly of
Eunomius in his assertion that the Son did not acquire His sonship by
obedience.](2050070)  
[He thus proceeds to a magnificent discourse of the interpretation of
“Mediator,” “Like,” “Ungenerate,” and “generate,” and of “The likeness
and seal of the energy of the Almighty and of His Works.”](2050071)  
[He expounds the passage of the Gospel, “The Father judgeth no man,” and
further speaks of the assumption of man with body and soul wrought by
the Lord, of the transgression of Adam, and of death and the
resurrection of the dead.](2050072)  
[He proceeds to discuss the views held by Eunomius, and by the Church,
touching the Holy Spirit; and to show that the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost are not three Gods, but one God. He also discusses different
senses of “Subjection,” and therein shows that the subjection of all
things to the Son is the same as the subjection of the Son to the
Father.](2050073)  
[Lastly he displays at length the folly of Eunomius, who at times speaks
of the Holy Spirit as created, and as the fairest work of the Son, and
at other times confesses, by the operations attributed to Him, that He
is God, and thus ends the book.](2050074)  
[Book III](2050075)  
[Section 1](2050076)  
[He then once more excellently, appropriately, and clearly examines and
expounds the passage, “The Lord Created Me.“](2050077)  
[He then shows, from the instance of Adam and Abel, and other examples,
the absence of alienation of essence in the case of the “generate” and
“ungenerate.”](2050078)  
[He thus shows the oneness of the Eternal Son with the Father the
identity of essence and the community of nature (wherein is a natural
inquiry into the production of wine), and that the terms “Son” and
“product” in the naming of the Only-Begotten include a like idea of
relationship.](2050079)  
[He discusses the incomprehensibility of the Divine essence, and the
saying to the woman of Samaria, “Ye worship ye know not
what.“](2050080)  
[Thereafter he expounds the appellation of “Son,” and of “product of
generation,” and very many varieties of “sons,” of God, of men, of rams,
of perdition, of light, and of day.](2050081)  
[Then he ends the book with an exposition of the Divine and Human names
of the Only-Begotten, and a discussion of the terms “generate” and
“ungenerate.”](2050082)  
[Book IV](2050083)  
[Section 1](2050084)  
[He convicts Eunomius of having used of the Only-begotten terms
applicable to the existence of the earth, and thus shows that his
intention is to prove the Son to be a being mutable and
created.](2050085)  
[He then again admirably discusses the term πρωτότοκος as it is four
times employed by the Apostle.](2050086)  
[He proceeds again to discuss the impassibility of the Lord's
generation; and the folly of Eunomius, who says that the generated
essence involves the appellation of Son, and again, forgetting this,
denies the relation of the Son to the Father: and herein he speaks of
Circe and of the mandrake poison.](2050087)  
[He again shows Eunomius, constrained by truth, in the character of an
advocate of the orthodox doctrine, confessing as most proper and
primary, not only the essence of the Father, but the essence also of the
Only-begotten.](2050088)  
[He then exposes argument about the “Generate,” and the “product of
making,” and “product of creation,” and shows the impious nature of the
language of Eunomius and Theognostus on the “immediate” and “undivided”
character of the essence, and its “relation to its creator and
maker.”](2050089)  
[He then clearly and skilfully criticises the doctrine of the
impossibility of comparison with the things made after the Son, and
exposes the idolatry contrived by Eunomius, and concealed by the
terminology of “Son” and “Only-begotten,” to deceive his
readers.](2050090)  
[He proceeds to show that there is no “variance” in the essence of the
Father and the Son: wherein he expounds many forms of variation and
harmony, and explains the “form,” the “seal,” and the “express
image.”](2050091)  
[Then, distinguishing between essence and generation, he declares the
empty and frivolous language of Eunomius to be like a rattle. He
proceeds to show that the language used by the great Basil on the
subject of the generation of the Only-begotten has been grievously
slandered by Eunomius, and so ends the book.](2050092)  
[Book V](2050093)  
[Section 1](2050094)  
[He then explains the phrase of S. Peter, “Him God made Lord and
Christ.” And herein he sets forth the opposing statement of Eunomius,
which he made on account of such phrase against S. Basil, and his
lurking revilings and insults.](2050095)  
[A remarkable and original reply to these utterances, and a
demonstration of the power of the Crucified, and of the fact that this
subjection was of the Human Nature, not that which the Only-Begotten has
from the Father. Also an explanation of the figure of the Cross, and of
the appellation “Christ,” and an account of the good gifts bestowed on
the Human Nature by the Godhead which was commingled with
it.](2050096)  
[He shows the falsehood of Eunomius' calumnious charge that the great
Basil had said that “man was emptied to become man,” and demonstrates
that the “emptying” of the Only-begotten took place with a view to the
restoration to life of the Man Who had suffered.](2050097)  
[Thereafter he shows that there are not two Christs or two Lords, but
one Christ and one Lord, and that the Divine nature, after mingling with
the Human, preserved the properties of each nature without confusion,
and declares that the operations are, by reason of the union, predicated
of the two natures in common, in the sense that the Lord took upon
Himself the sufferings of the servant, and the humanity is glorified
with Him in the honour that is the Lord's, and that by the power of the
Divine Nature that is made anew, conformably with that Divine Nature
Itself.](2050098)  
[Book VI](2050099)  
[Section 1](2050100)  
[Then he again mentions S. Peter's word, “made,” and the passage in the
Epistle to the Hebrews, which says that Jesus was made by God “an
Apostle and High Priest”: and, after giving a sufficient answer to the
charges brought against him by Eunomius, shows that Eunomius himself
supports Basil's arguments, and says that the Only-begotten Son, when He
had put on the flesh, became Lord.](2050101)  
[He then gives a notable explanation of the saying of the Lord to
Philip, “He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father;” and herein he
excellently discusses the suffering of the Lord in His love to man, and
the impassibility, creative power, and providence of the Father, and the
composite nature of men, and their resolution into the elements of which
they were composed.](2050102)  
[Then returning to the words of Peter, “God made Him Lord and Christ,”
he skilfully explains it by many arguments, and herein shows Eunomius as
an advocate of the orthodox doctrine, and concludes the book by showing
that the Divine and Human names are applied, by reason of the
commixture, to either Nature.](2050103)  
[Book VII](2050104)  
[Section 1](2050105)  
[He then declares that the close relation between names and things is
immutable, and thereafter proceeds accordingly, in the most excellent
manner, with his discourse concerning “generated” and
“ungenerate.”](2050106)  
[Thereafter he discusses the divergence of names and of things,
speaking, of that which is ungenerate as without a cause, and of that
which is non-existent, as the Scindapsus, Minotaur, Blityri, Cyclops,
Scylla, which never were generated at all, and shows that things which
are essentially different, are mutually destructive, as fire of water,
and the rest in their several relations. But in the case of the Father
and the Son, as the essence is common, and the properties reciprocally
interchangeable, no injury results to the Nature.](2050107)  
[He says that all things that are in creation have been named by man,
if, as is the case, they are called differently by every nation, as also
the appellation of “Ungenerate” is conferred by us: but that the proper
appellation of the Divine essence itself which expresses the Divine
Nature, either does not exist at all, or is unknown to us.](2050108)  
[After much discourse concerning the actually existent, and ungenerate
and good, and upon the consubstantiality of the heavenly powers, showing
the uncharted character of their essence, yet the difference of their
ranks, he ends the book.](2050109)  
[Book VIII](2050110)  
[Section 1](2050111)  
[He then discusses the “willing” of the Father concerning the generation
of the Son, and shows that the object of that good will is from
eternity, which is the Son, existing in the Father, and being closely
related to the process of willing, as the ray to the flame, or the act
of seeing to the eye.](2050112)  
[Then, thus passing over what relates to the essence of the Son as
having been already discussed, he treats of the sense involved in
“generation,” saying that there are diverse generations, those effected
by matter and art, and of buildings,--and that by succession of
animals,--and those by efflux, as by the sun and its beam. The lamp and
its radiance, scents and ointments and the quality diffused by
them,--and the word produced by the mind; and cleverly discusses
generation from rotten wood; and from the condensation of fire, and
countless other causes.](2050113)  
[He further shows the operations of God to be expressed by human
illustrations; for what hands and feet and the other parts of the body
with which men work are, that, in the case of God, the will alone is, in
place of these. And so also arises the divergence of generation;
wherefore He is called Only-begotten, because He has no community with
other generation such as is observed in creation, but in that He is
called the “brightness of glory,” and the “savour of ointment,” He shows
the close conjunction and co-eternity of His Nature with the
Father.](2050114)  
[Then, after showing that the Person of the Only-begotten and Maker of
things has no beginning, as have the things that were made by Him, as
Eunomius says, but that the Only-begotten is without beginning and
eternal, and has no community, either of essence or of names, with the
creation, but is co-existent with the Father from everlasting, being, as
the all-excellent Wisdom says, “the beginning and end and midst of the
times,” and after making many observations on the Godhead and eternity
of the Only-begotten, and also concerning souls and angels, and life and
death, he concludes the book.](2050115)  
[Book IX](2050116)  
[Section 1](2050117)  
[He then ingeniously shows that the generation of the Son is not
according to the phrase of Eunomius, “The Father begat Him at that time
when He chose, and not before:” but that the Son, being the fulness of
all that is good and excellent, is always contemplated in the Father;
using for this demonstration the support of Eunomius' own
arguments.](2050118)  
[He further shows that the pretemporal generation of the Son is not the
subject of influences drawn from ordinary and carnal generation, but is
without beginning and without end, and not according to the fabrications
constructed by Eunomius, in ignorance of His power, from the statements
of Plato concerning the soul and from the sabbath rest of the
Hebrews.](2050119)  
[Then, having shown that Eunomius' calumny against the great Basil, that
he called the Only-begotten “Ungenerate,” is false, and having again
with much ingenuity discussed the eternity, being, and endlessness of
the Only-begotten, and the creation of light and of darkness, he
concludes the book.](2050120)  
[Book X](2050121)  
[Section 1](2050122)  
[He then wonderfully displays the Eternal Life, which is Christ, to
those who confess Him not, and applies to them the mournful lamentation
of Jeremiah over Jehoiakim, as being closely allied to Montanus and
Sabellius.](2050123)  
[He then shows the eternity of the Son's generation, and the inseparable
identity of His essence with Him that begat Him, and likens the folly of
Eunomius to children playing with sand.](2050124)  
[After this he shows that the Son, who truly is, and is in the bosom of
the Father, is simple and uncompounded, and that, He Who redeemed us
from bondage is not under dominion of the Father, nor in a state of
slavery: and that otherwise not He alone, but also the Father Who is in
the Son and is One with Him, must be a slave; and that the word “being”
is formed from the word to “be.” And having excellently and notably
discussed all these matters, he concludes the book.](2050125)  
[Book XI](2050126)  
[Section 1](2050127)  
[He also ingeniously shows from the passage of the Gospel which speaks
of “Good Master,” from the parable of the Vineyard, from Isaiah and from
Paul, that there is not a dualism in the Godhead of good and evil, as
Eunomius' ally Marcion supposes, and declares that the Son does not
refuse the title of “good” or “Existent,” or acknowledge His alienation
from the Father, but that to Him also belongs authority over all things
that come into being.](2050128)  
[He then exposes the ignorance of Eunomius, and the incoherence and
absurdity of his arguments, in speaking of the Son as “the Angel of the
Existent,” and as being as much below the Divine Nature as the Son is
superior to the things created by Himself. And in this connection there
is a noble and forcible counter-statement and an indignant refutation,
showing that He Who gave the oracles to Moses is Himself the Existent,
the Only-begotten Son, Who to the petition of Moses, “If Thou Thyself
goest not with us, carry me not up hence,” said, “I will do this also
that thou hast said”; Who is also called “Angel” both by Moses and
Isaiah: wherein is cited the text, “Unto us a Child is
born.”](2050129)  
[After this, fearing to extend his reply to great length, he passes by
most of his adversary's statements as already refuted. But the
remainder, for the sake of those who deem them of much force, he briefly
summarizes, and refutes the blasphemy of Eunomius, who says of the Lord
also that He is what animals and plants in all creation are,
non-existent before their own generation; and so with the production of
frogs; alas for the blasphemy!](2050130)  
[Eunomius again speaks of the Son as Lord and God, and Maker of all
creation intelligible and sensible, having received from the Father the
power and the commission for creation, being entrusted with the task of
creation as if He were an artizan commissioned by some one hiring Him,
and receiving His power of creation as a thing adventitious, ab extra,
as a result of the power allotted to Him in accordance with such and
such combinations and positions of the stars, as destiny decrees their
lot in life to men at their nativity. Thus, passing by most of what
Eunomius had written, he confutes his blasphemy that the Maker of all
things came into being in like manner with the earth and with angels,
and that the subsistence of the Only-begotten differs not at all from
the genesis of all things, and reproaches Him with reverencing neither
the Divine mystery nor the custom of the Church, nor following in his
attempt to discover godliness any teacher of pious doctrine, but
Manichæus, Colluthus, Arius, Aetius, and](2050131)  
[Book XII](2050132)  
[Section 1](2050133)  
[Then referring to the blasphemy of Eunomius, which had been refuted by
the great Basil, where he banished the Only-begotten God to the realm of
darkness, and the apology or explanation which Eunomius puts forth for
his blasphemy, he shows that his present blasphemy is rendered by his
apology worse than his previous one; and herein he very ably discourses
of the “true” and the “unapproachable” Light.](2050134)  
[He further proceeds notably to interpret the language of the Gospel,
“In the beginning was the Word,” and “Life” and “Light,” and “The Word
was made flesh,” which had been misinterpreted by Eunomius; and
overthrows his blasphemy, and shows that the dispensation of the Lord
took place by loving-kindness, not by lack of power, and with the
co-operation of the Father.](2050135)  
[He then again charges Eunomius with having learnt his term ἀγεννησία
from the hieroglyphic writings, and from the Egyptian mythology and
idolatry, and with bringing in Anubis, Osiris, and Isis to the creed of
Christians, and shows that, considered as admitting His sufferings of
necessity and not voluntarily, the Only-begotten is entitled to no
gratitude from men: and that fire has none for its warmth, nor water for
its fluidity, as they do not refer their results to self-determining
power, but to necessity of nature.](2050136)  
[Then, again discussing the true Light and unapproachable Light of the
Father and of the Son, special attributes, community and essence, and
showing the relation of “generate” and “ungenerate,” as involving no
opposition in sense, but presenting an opposition and contradiction
admitting of no middle term, he ends the book.](2050137)
