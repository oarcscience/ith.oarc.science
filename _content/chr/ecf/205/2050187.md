<span id="x.ii.ii.vi-p1"></span> V. *That man is a likeness of the
Divine sovereignty* <span id="fr_1597"></span>[1599](#fn_1597) .

<span id="x.ii.ii.vi-p3"></span>1. It is true, indeed, that the Divine
beauty is not adorned with any shape or endowment of form, by any beauty
of colour, but is contemplated as excellence in unspeakable bliss. As
then painters transfer human forms to their pictures by the means of
certain colours, laying on their copy the proper and corresponding
tints, so that the beauty of the original may be accurately transferred
to the likeness, so I would have you understand that our Maker also,
painting the portrait to resemble His own beauty, by the addition of
virtues, as it were with colours, shows in us His own sovereignty: and
manifold and varied are the tints, so to say, by which His true form is
portrayed: not red, or white <span id="fr_1598"></span>[1600](#fn_1598)
, or the blending of these, whatever it may be called, nor a touch of
black that paints the eyebrow and the eye, and shades, by some
combination, the depressions in the figure, and all such arts which the
hands of painters contrive, but instead of these, purity, freedom from
passion, blessedness, alienation from all evil, and all those attributes
of the like kind which help to form in men the likeness of God: with
such hues as these did the Maker of His own image mark our nature.

<span id="x.ii.ii.vi-p5"></span>2. And if you were to examine the other
points also by which the Divine beauty is expressed, you will find that
to them too the likeness in the image which we present is perfectly
preserved. The Godhead is mind and word: for “in the beginning was the
Word <span id="fr_1599"></span>[1601](#fn_1599) ” and the followers of
Paul “have the mind of Christ” which “speaks” in them <span
id="fr_1600"></span>[1602](#fn_1600) : humanity too is not far removed
from these: you see in yourself word and understanding, an imitation of
the very Mind and Word. Again, God is love, and the fount of love: for
this the great John declares, that “love is of God,” and “God is
love <span id="fr_1601"></span>[1603](#fn_1601) ”: the Fashioner of our
nature has made this to be our feature too: for “hereby,” He says,
“shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye love one
another <span id="fr_1602"></span>[1604](#fn_1602) ”:—thus, if this be
absent, the whole stamp of the likeness is transformed. The Deity
beholds and hears all things, and searches all things out: you too have
the power of apprehension of things by means of sight and hearing, and
the understanding that inquires into things and searches them out.
