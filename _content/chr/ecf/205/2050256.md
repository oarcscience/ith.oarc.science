<span id="xi.ii.xxxviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxviii-p2.1"></span>For</span> common sense as well as the
teaching of Scripture shows that it is impossible for one who has not
thoroughly cleansed himself from all the stains arising from evil to be
admitted amongst the heavenly company. This is a thing which, though
little in itself, is the beginning and foundation of great blessings. I
call it little on account of the facility of the means of amendment. For
what difficulty is there in this matter? viz. to believe that God is
everywhere, and that being in all things He is also present with those
who call upon Him for His life-supporting power, and that, thus present,
He does that which properly belongs to Him to do. Now, the work properly
belonging to the Divine energy is the salvation of those who need it;
and this salvation proves effectual <span
id="fr_2033"></span>[2035](#fn_2033) by means of the cleansing in the
water; and he that has been so cleansed will participate in Purity; and
true Purity is Deity. You see, then, how small a thing it is in its
beginning, and how easily effected; I mean, faith and water; the first
residing within the will, the latter being the nursery companion of the
life of man. But as to the blessing which springs from these two things,
oh! how great and how wonderful it is, that it should imply relationship
with Deity itself!
