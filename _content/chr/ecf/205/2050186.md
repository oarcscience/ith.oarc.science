<span id="x.ii.ii.v-p1"></span> IV. *That the construction of man
throughout signifies his ruling power* <span
id="fr_1595"></span>[1597](#fn_1595) .

<span id="x.ii.ii.v-p3"></span>1. For as in our own life artificers
fashion a tool in the way suitable to its use, so the best Artificer
made our nature as it were a formation fit for the exercise of royalty,
preparing it at once by superior advantages of soul, and by the very
form of the body, to be such as to be <span id="page_391">p. 391</span>
<span id="x.ii.ii.v-Page_391"></span>adapted for royalty: for the soul
immediately shows its royal and exalted character, far removed as it is
from the lowliness of private station, in that it owns no lord, and is
self-governed, swayed autocratically by its own will; for to whom else
does this belong than to a king? And further, besides these facts, the
fact that it is the image of that Nature which rules over all means
nothing else than this, that our nature was created to be royal from the
first. For as, in men’s ordinary use, those who make images <span
id="fr_1596"></span>[1598](#fn_1596) of princes both mould the figure of
their form, and represent along with this the royal rank by the vesture
of purple, and even the likeness is commonly spoken of as “a king,” so
the human nature also, as it was made to rule the rest, was, by its
likeness to the King of all, made as it were a living image, partaking
with the archetype both in rank and in name, not vested in purple, nor
giving indication of its rank by sceptre and diadem (for the archetype
itself is not arrayed with these), but instead of the purple robe,
clothed in virtue, which is in truth the most royal of all raiment, and
in place of the sceptre, leaning on the bliss of immortality, and
instead of the royal diadem, decked with the crown of righteousness; so
that it is shown to be perfectly like to the beauty of its archetype in
all that belongs to the dignity of royalty.

<span id="x.ii.ii.v-p2"></span> The title in the Bodleian Latin <span

kingly dignity of the human form.”

<span id="x.ii.ii.v-p4"></span> It is not clear whether the reference
here is to painting or to sculpture, of which the product was afterwards
painted. The combination of <span class="Greek"><span

suggests the latter.
