<span id="x.ii.ii.iv-p1"></span> III. *That the nature of man is more
precious than all the visible creation* <span
id="fr_1593"></span>[1595](#fn_1593)

<span id="x.ii.ii.iv-p3"></span>1. But it is right that we should not
leave this point without consideration, that while the world, great as
it is, and its parts, are laid as an elemental foundation for the
formation of the universe, the creation is, so to say, made offhand by
the Divine power, existing at once on His command, while counsel
precedes the making of man; and that which is to be is foreshown by the
Maker in verbal description, and of what kind it is fitting that it
should be, and to what archetype it is fitting that it should bear a
likeness, and for what it shall be made, and what its operation shall be
when it is made, and of what it shall be the ruler,—all these things the
saying examines beforehand, so that he has a rank assigned him before
his genesis, and possesses rule over the things that are before his
coming into being; for it says, “God said, Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
and the beasts of the earth, and the fowls of the heaven, and the
cattle, and all the earth <span id="fr_1594"></span>[1596](#fn_1594) .”

<span id="x.ii.ii.iv-p5"></span>2. O marvellous! a sun is made, and no
counsel precedes; a heaven likewise; and to these no single thing in
creation is equal. So great a wonder is formed by a word alone, and the
saying indicates neither when, nor how, nor any such detail. So too in
all particular cases, the æther, the stars, the intermediate air, the
sea, the earth, the animals, the plants,—all are brought into being with
a word, while only to the making of man does the Maker of all draw near
with circumspection, so as to prepare beforehand for him material for
his formation, and to liken his form to an archetypal beauty, and,
setting before him a mark for which he is to come into being, to make
for him a nature appropriate and allied to the operations, and suitable
for the object in hand.
