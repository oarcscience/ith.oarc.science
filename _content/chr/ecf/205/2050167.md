<span id="ix.ii.ii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.</span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.xviii-p2.1"></span>Let</span> that which was then said by
our Lord be the general maxim for every life; especially let it be the
maxim for those who are coming nearer God through the gateway of
virginity, that they should never in watching for a perfection in one
direction present an unguarded side in another and contrary one; but
should in all directions realize the good, so that they may guarantee in
all things their holy life against failure. A soldier does not arm
himself only on some points, leaving the rest of his body to take its
chance unprotected. If he were to receive his death-wound upon that,
what would have been the advantage of this partial armour? Again, who
would call that feature faultless, which from some accident had lost one
of those requisites which go to make up the sum of beauty? The
disfigurement of the mutilated part mars the grace of the part
untouched. The Gospel im<span id="page_363">p. 363</span> <span
id="ix.ii.ii.xviii-Page_363"></span>plies that he who undertakes the
building of a tower, but spends all his labour upon the foundations
without ever reaching the completion, is worthy of ridicule; and what
else do we learn from the Parable of the Tower, but to strive to come to
the finish of every lofty purpose, accomplishing the work of God in all
the multiform structures of His commandments? One stone, indeed, is no
more the whole edifice of the Tower, than one commandment kept will
raise the soul’s perfection to the required height. The foundation must
by all means first be laid but over it, as the Apostle says <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[1455](#fn_1453) , the edifice of gold and precious
gems must be built; for so is the doing of the commandment put by the
Prophet who cries, “I have loved Thy commandment above gold and many a
precious stone <span id="fr_1454"></span>[1456](#fn_1454) .” Let the
virtuous life have for its substructure the love of virginity; but upon
this let every result of virtue be reared. If virginity is believed to
be a vastly precious thing and to have a divine look (as indeed is the
case, as well as men believe of it), yet, if the whole life does not
harmonize with this perfect note, and it be marred by the
succeeding <span id="fr_1455"></span>[1457](#fn_1455) discord of the
soul, this thing becomes but “the jewel of gold in the swine’s
snout <span id="fr_1456"></span>[1458](#fn_1456) ” or “the pearl that is
trodden under the swine’s feet.” But we have said enough upon this.
