<p class="c49"><a name="viii.i.iii.viii-p1"></A>  &sect;8. <i>Facts show that the terms of abuse which he has employed against Basil are more suitable for himself.</i></p>  
<p class="c12"><a name="viii.i.iii.viii-p2"></A>But these remarks are by the way, and come from our not keeping close to our argument. We had to inquire not how he ought to have made his apology, but whether he had ever made one at all. But now let us return to our former position, viz., that he is convicted by his own statements. This hater of falsehood first of all tells us that he was condemned because the jury which was assigned him defied the law, and that he was driven over sea and land and suffered much from the burning sun and the dust. Then in trying to conceal his falsehood he drives out one nail with another nail, as the proverb says, and puts one falsehood right by cancelling it with another. As every one knows as well as he does that he never uttered one word in court, he declares that he begged to be let off coming into a hostile court and was condemned by default. Could there <A NAME="page_XLIII"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. XLIII</FONT></A> <a name="viii.i.iii.viii-Page_XLIII"></A>be a plainer case than this of a man contradicting both the truth and himself? When he is pressed about the title of his book, he makes his trial the constraining cause of this &#145;apology;&#146; but when he is pressed with the fact that he spoke not one word to the jury, he denies that there was any trial and says that he declined&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">83</FONT></A>
 such a jury. See how valiantly this doughty champion of the truth fights against falsehood! Then he dares to call our mighty Basil &#145;a malicious rascal and a liar;&#146; and besides that, &#145;a bold ignorant parvenu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">84</FONT></A>
,&#146; &#145;no deep divine,&#146; and he adds to his list of abusive terms, &#145;stark mad,&#146; scattering an infinity of such words over his pages, as if he imagined that his own bitter invectives could outweigh the common testimony of mankind, who revere that great name as though he were one of the saints of old. He thinks in fact that he, if no one else, can touch with calumny one whom calumny has never touched; but the sun is not so low in the heavens that any one can reach him with stones or any other missiles; they will but recoil upon him who shot them, while the intended target soars far beyond his reach. If any one, again, accuses the sun of want of light, he has not dimmed the brightness of the sunbeams with his scoffs; the sun will still remain the sun, and the fault-finder will only prove the feebleness of his own visual organs; and, if he should endeavour, after the fashion of this &#145;apology,&#146; to persuade all whom he meets and will listen to him not to give in to the common opinions about the sun, nor to attach more weight to the experiences of all than to the surmises of one individual by &#145;assigning victory to mere quantity,&#146; his nonsense will be wasted on those who can use their eyes.</p>  
<p class="c14"><a name="viii.i.iii.viii-p5"></A>Let some one then persuade Eunomius to bridle his tongue, and not give the rein to such wild talk, nor kick against the pricks in the insolent abuse of an honoured name; but to allow the mere remembrance of Basil to fill his soul with reverence and awe. What can he gain by this unmeasured ribaldry, when the object of it will retain all that character which his life, his words, and the general estimate of the civilized world proclaims him to have possessed? The man who takes in hand to revile reveals his own disposition as not being able, because it is evil, to speak good things, but only &#8220;to speak from the abundance of the heart,&#8221; and to bring forth from that evil treasure-house. Now, that his expressions are merely those of abuse quite divorced from actual facts, can be proved from his own writings.</p>
