<span id="xi.ii.xxxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>Yet</span>, even in their reply to this,
or the like, they are not at a loss for a contentious rejoinder. For
they assert that God, if He had been so pleased, might have forcibly
drawn those, who were not inclined to yield, to accept the Gospel
message. But where then would have been their free will? Where their
virtuous merit? Where their meed of praise from their moral directors?
It belongs only to inanimate or irrational creatures to be brought round
by the will of another to his purpose; whereas the reasoning and
intelligent nature, if it lays aside its freedom of action, loses at the
same time the gracious gift of intellect. For upon what is he to employ
any faculty of thought, if his power of choosing anything according to
his inclination lies in the will of another? But then, if the will
remains without the capacity of action, virtue necessarily disappears,
since it is shackled by the enforced quiescence of the will. Then, if
virtue does not exist, life loses its value, reason moves in accordance
with fatalism, the praise of moral guardians <span
id="fr_2010"></span>[2012](#fn_2010) is gone, sin may be indulged in
without risk, and the difference between the courses of life is
obliterated. For who, henceforth, could with any reason condemn
profligacy, or praise sobriety? Since <span
id="fr_2011"></span>[2013](#fn_2011) every one would have this ready
answer, that nothing of all the things we are inclined to is in our own
power, but that by some superior and ruling influence the wills of men
are brought round to the purpose of one who has the mastery over them.
The conclusion, then is that it is not the goodness of God that is
chargeable with the fact that the Faith is not engendered in all men,
but rather the disposition of those by whom the preaching of the Word is
received.
