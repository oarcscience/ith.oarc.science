<span id="xiii.vi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xiii.vi-p2.1"></span>That</span> for which the king of the
Macedonians is most admired by people of understanding,—for he is
admired not so much for his famous victories <span
id="fr_2177"></span>[2179](#fn_2177) over the Persians and Indians, and
his penetrating as far the Ocean, as for his saying that he had his
treasure in his friends;—in this respect I dare to compare myself with
his marvellous exploits, and it will be right for me to utter such a
sentiment too. Now because I am rich in friendships, perhaps I surpass
in that kind of property even that great man who plumed himself upon
that very thing. For who was such a friend to him as you are to me,
perpetually endeavouring to surpass yourself in every kind of
excellence? For assuredly no one would ever charge me with flattery,
when I say this, if he were to look at my age and your life: for grey
hairs are out of season for flattery, and old age is ill-suited for
complaisance, and as for you, even if you are ever in season for
flattery, yet praise would not fall under the suspicion of flattery, as
your life shows forth your praise before words. But since, when men are
rich in blessings, it is a special gift to know how to use what one has,
and the best use of superfluities is to let one’s friends share them
with one, and since my be<span id="page_531">p. 531</span> <span
id="xiii.vi-Page_531"></span>loved son Alexander is most of all a friend
united to me in all sincerity, be persuaded to show him my treasure, and
not only to show it to him, but also to put it at his disposal to enjoy
abundantly, by extending to him your protection in those matters about
which he has come to you, begging you to be his patron. He will tell you
all with his own lips. For it is better so than that I should go into
details in a letter.

<span id="xiii.vi-p3"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.vi-p3.1"></span>διηγήμασιν</span>. “He believed in fidelity,
and was capable of the sublimest, most intimate friendships. He loved
Hephæstion so fervently, that.…he remained inconsolable for his
loss.”—F. Schlegel. Achilles was his hero: for he too knew the delight
of a constant friendship.
