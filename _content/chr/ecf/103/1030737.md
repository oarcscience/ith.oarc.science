<span id="v.vii.vi-p1"></span> 5. I would, however, proceed to a more
searching <span id="fr_2485"></span>[2486](#fn_2485) and diligent
consideration and handling of these words, had I not other places of his
Epistles much more manifest, by comparing which, both these are made
more clearly manifest, and if these were not in existence, those others
would suffice. To the Corinthians, namely, writing of this same thing,
he saith thus, “Am I not free? am I not an Apostle? <span
id="fr_2486"></span>[2487](#fn_2486) Have I not seen Christ Jesus our
Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord? If to others I am not an Apostle,
to you assuredly I am. For the seal of mine Apostleship are ye in the
Lord. My defense to them which interrogate me is this. Have we not power
to eat and to drink? Have we not power to lead about a woman who is a
sister, <span id="fr_2487"></span>[2488](#fn_2487) as also the other
Apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?” See how first he
shows what is lawful to him, and therefore lawful for that he is an
Apostle. For with that he began, “Am I not free? am I not an Apostle?”
and proves himself to be an Apostle, saying, “Have I not seen Christ
Jesus our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord?” Which being proved, he
shows that to be lawful to him which was so to the other Apostles; that
is, that he should not work with his hands, but live by the Gospel, as
the Lord appointed, which in what follows he has most <span
id="page_506">p. 506</span> <span id="v.vii.vi-Page_506"></span>openly
demonstrated; for to this end did also faithful women which had earthly
substance go with them, and minister unto them of their substance, that
they might lack none of those things which pertain to the necessities of
this life. Which thing blessed Paul demonstrates to be lawful indeed
unto himself, as also the other Apostles did it, but that he had not
chosen to use this power he afterwards mentions. This thing some not
understanding, have interpreted not “a woman which is a sister,” when he
said, “Have we not power to lead about a sister a woman;” but, “a sister
a wife.” They were misled by the ambiguity of the Greek word, because
both “wife” and “woman” is expressed in Greek by the same word. Though
indeed the Apostle has so put this that they ought not to have made this
mistake; for that he neither says “a woman” merely, but “a sister
woman;” nor “to take” (as in marriage), but “to take about” (as on a
journey). Howbeit other interpreters have not been misled by this
ambiguity, and they have interpreted “woman” not “wife.”
