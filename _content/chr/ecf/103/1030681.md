<span id="v.v.xxxviii-p1"></span> 37. Likewise, touching that which is
written, “A son which receiveth the word shall be far from destruction:
but receiving, he receiveth it for himself, and no falsehood proceedeth
out of his mouth:” <span id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365) some one
may say, that what is here set down, “A son which receiveth the word,”
is to be taken for no other than the word of God, which is truth.
Therefore, “A son receiving the truth shall be far from destruction,”
refers to that which is written, “Thou wilt destroy all that speak
leasing.” But when it follows, “Receiving he receiveth for himself,”
what other doth this insinuate than what the Apostle saith, “But let
every man prove his own work, and then he shall have glorying in
him<span id="page_474">p. 474</span> <span
id="v.v.xxxviii-Page_474"></span>self and not in another?” <span
id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366) For he that receiveth the word,
that is, truth, not for himself, but for men-pleasing, keepeth it not
when he sees they can be pleased by a lie. But whoso receiveth it for
himself, no falsehood proceedeth out of his mouth: because even when the
way to please men is to lie, that man lieth not, who receiving the truth
not thereby to please them but to please God, hath received it for
himself. Therefore there is no reason why it should be said here He will
destroy all who speak leasing, but not all leasing: because all lies,
universally, are cut off in this saying, “And no falsehood proceedeth
out of his mouth.” But another saith, it is to be so taken as the
Apostle Paul took our Lord’s saying, “But I say unto you, Swear not at
all.” <span id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367) For here also all
swearing is cut off; but from the mouth of the heart, that it should
never be done with approbation of the will, but through necessity of the
weakness of another; that is, “from the evil” of another, when it shows
that he cannot otherwise be got to believe what is said, unless faith be
wrought by an oath; or, from that “evil” of our own, that while as yet
involved in the skins of this mortality we are not able to show our
heart: which thing were we able to do, of swearing there were no need.
Though moreover in this whole sentence, if the saying, “A son receiving
the word shall be far from destruction,” be said of none other than that
Truth, <span id="fr_2368"></span>[2369](#fn_2368) by Whom all things
were made, which remaineth ever incommutable; then, because the doctrine
of Religion strives to bring men to the contemplation of this Truth, it
may seem that the saying, “And no falsehood proceedeth out of his
mouth,” is said to this purpose, that he speaketh no falsehood that
pertaineth to doctrine. Which sort of lie is upon no compensation
whatever to be gone into, and is utterly and before all to be eschewed.
Or if the saying, “No falsehood,” is absurdly taken if it be not
referred to every lie, the saying, “From his mouth,” should, as was
argued above, be taken to mean the mouth of the heart, in the opinion of
him who accounts that sometimes one may tell a lie.
