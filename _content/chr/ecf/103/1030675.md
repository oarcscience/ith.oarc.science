<span id="v.v.xxxii-p1"></span> 31. Thus then what is written, “The
mouth that lieth, slayeth the soul;” <span
id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350) of what mouth it speaketh, is the
question. For in general when the Scripture speaks of the mouth, it
signifies the very seat of our conception <span
id="fr_2351"></span>[2352](#fn_2351) in the heart, where is approved and
decreed whatever also by the voice, when we speak the truth, is uttered:
so that he lieth with the heart who approveth a lie; yet that man may
possibly not lie with the heart, who uttereth other than is in his mind,
in such sort that he knows it to be for the sake of avoiding a greater
evil that he admitteth an evil, disapproving withal both the one and the
other. And they who assert this, say that thus also is to be understood
that which is written, “He that speaketh the truth in his heart:” <span
id="fr_2352"></span>[2353](#fn_2352) because always in the heart truth
must be spoken; but not always in the mouth of the body, if any cause of
avoiding a greater evil require that other than is in the mind be
uttered with the voice. And that there is indeed a mouth of the heart,
may be understood even from this, that where there is speech, there a
mouth is with no absurdity understood: nor would it be right to say,
“Who speaketh in his heart,” unless it were right to understand that
there is also a mouth in the heart. Though in that very place where it
is written, “The mouth that lieth, slayeth the soul,” if the context of
the lesson be considered, it may peradventure be taken for no other than
the mouth of the heart. For there is an obscure response there, where it
is hidden from men, to whom the mouth of the heart, unless the mouth of
the body sound therewith, is not audible. But that mouth, the Scripture
in that place saith, doth reach to the hearing of the Spirit of the
Lord, Who hath filled the whole earth; at the same time mentioning lips
and voice and tongue in that place; yet all these the sense permitteth
not to be taken, but concerning the heart, because it saith of the Lord,
that what is spoken is not hidden from Him: now that which is spoken
with that sound which reacheth to our ears, is not hidden from men
either. Thus, namely, is it written: “The Spirit of wisdom is loving,
and will not acquit an evil-speaker of his lips: for of his reins God is
witness, and of his heart a true searcher, and of his tongue a hearer.
For the Spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole earth, and that which
containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice. Therefore he that
speaketh unrighteous things cannot be hid: but neither shall the
judgment when it punisheth pass by him. For in the thoughts of the
ungodly shall there be interrogation; and the hearing of his words shall
come from the Lord, to the punishment of his iniquities. <span
id="fr_2353"></span>[2354](#fn_2353) For the ear of jealousy heareth all
things, and the tumult of murmurings will not be hid. Therefore keep
yourselves from murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and from backbiting
refrain your tongue: because an obscure response will not go into the
void. <span id="fr_2354"></span>[2355](#fn_2354) But the mouth that
lieth, slayeth the soul.” <span id="fr_2355"></span>[2356](#fn_2355) It
seems then to threaten them who think that to be obscure and secret,
which they agitate and turn over in their heart. And this, it would
show, is so clear to the ears of God, that it even calls it “tumult.”
