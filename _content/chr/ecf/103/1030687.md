<span id="v.v.xliv-p1"></span> 43. So great blindness, moreover, hath
occupied men’s minds, that to them it is too little if we pronounce some
lies not to be sins; but they must needs pronounce it to be sin in some
things if we refuse to lie: and to such a pass have they been brought by
defending lying, that even that first kind which is of all the most
abominably wicked they pronounce to have been used by the Apostle Paul.
For in the Epistle to the Galatians, written as it was, like the rest,
for doctrine of religion and piety, they say that he has told a lie, in
the passage where he says concerning Peter and Barnabas, “When I saw
that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the
Gospel.” <span id="fr_2379"></span>[2380](#fn_2379) For, while they wish
to defend Peter from error, and from that pravity of way into which he
had fallen; the very way of religion in which is salvation for all men,
they by breaking and mincing the authority of the Scriptures do endeavor
themselves to overthrow. In which they do not see that it is not only
lying, but perjury that they lay to the charge of the Apostle in the
very doctrine of piety, that is, in an Epistle in which he preaches the
Gospel; seeing that he there saith, before he relates that matter, “What
I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.” <span
id="fr_2380"></span>[2381](#fn_2380) But it is time that we set bounds
to this disputation: in the consideration and treatment whereof
altogether there is nothing more meet to be, before all else, borne in
mind and made our prayer, than that which the same Apostle saith: “God
is faithful, Who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are
able to bear, but will with the temptation make also a way to escape,
that ye may be able to bear it.” <span
