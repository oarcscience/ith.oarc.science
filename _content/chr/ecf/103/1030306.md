<span id="iv.ii.lviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 56.—The Holy Spirit and the Church.
The Church is the Temple of God.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lviii-p2"></span>And now, having spoken of Jesus Christ,
the only Son of God, our Lord, with the brevity suitable to a confession
of our faith, we go on to say that we believe also in the Holy
Ghost,—thus completing the Trinity which constitutes the Godhead. Then
we mention the Holy Church. And thus we are made to understand that the
intelligent creation, which constitutes the free Jerusalem, <span
id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186) ought to be subordinate in the
order of speech to the Creator, the Supreme Trinity: for all that is
said of the man Christ Jesus has reference, of course, to the unity of
the person of the Only-begotten. Therefore the true order of the Creed
demanded that the Church should be made subordinate to the Trinity, as
the house to Him who dwells in it, the temple to God who occupies it,
and the city to its builder. And we are here to understand the whole
Church, not that part of it only which wanders as a stranger on the
earth, praising the name of God from the rising of the sun to the going
down of the same, and singing a new song of deliverance from its old
captivity; but that part also which has always from its creation
remained steadfast to God in heaven, and has never experienced the
misery consequent upon a fall. This part is made up of the holy angels,
who enjoy uninterrupted happiness; and (as it is bound to do) it renders
assistance to the part which is still wandering among strangers: for
these two parts shall be one in the fellowship of eternity, and now they
are one in the bonds of love, the whole having been ordained for the
worship of the one God. Wherefore, neither the whole Church, nor any
part of it, has any desire to be worshipped instead of God, nor to be
God to any one who belongs to the temple of God—that temple which is
built up of the saints who were created by the uncreated God. And
therefore the Holy Spirit, if a creature, could not be the Creator, but
would be a part <span id="page_256">p. 256</span> <span
id="iv.ii.lviii-Page_256"></span>of the intelligent creation. He would
simply be the highest creature, and therefore would not be mentioned in
the Creed before the Church; for He Himself would belong to the Church,
to that part of it which is in the heavens. And He would not have a
temple, for He Himself would be part of a temple. Now He has a temple,
of which the apostle says: “Know ye not that your body is the temple of
the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God?” <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187) Of which body he says in another
place: “Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?” <span
id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188) How, then, is He not God, seeing
that He has a temple? and how can He be less than Christ, whose members
are His temple? Nor has He one temple, and God another, seeing that the
same apostle says: “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?” <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[1190](#fn_1189) and adds, as proof of this, “and
that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you.” <span
id="fr_1190"></span>[1191](#fn_1190) God, then, dwells in His temple:
not the Holy Spirit only, but the Father also, and the Son, who says of
His own body, through which He was made Head of the Church upon earth
(“that in all things He might have the pre-eminence):” <span
id="fr_1191"></span>[1192](#fn_1191) “Destroy this temple, and in three
days I will raise it up.” <span id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192) The
temple of God, then, that is, of the Supreme Trinity as a whole, is the
Holy Church, embracing in its full extent both heaven and earth.
