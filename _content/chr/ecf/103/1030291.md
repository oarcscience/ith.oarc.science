<span id="iv.ii.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41.—Christ, Who Was Himself Free
from Sin, Was Made Sin for Us, that We Might Be Reconciled to
God.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xliii-p2"></span>Begotten and conceived, then, without
any indulgence of carnal lust, and therefore bringing with Him no
original sin, and by the grace of God joined and united in a wonderful
and unspeakable way in one person with the Word, the Only-begotten of
the Father, a son by nature, not by grace, and therefore having no sin
of His own; nevertheless, on account of the likeness of sinful flesh in
which He came, He was called sin, that He might be sacrificed to wash
away sin. For, under the Old Covenant, sacrifices for sin were called
sins. <span id="fr_1158"></span>[1159](#fn_1158) And He, of whom all
these sacrifices were types and shadows, was Himself truly made sin.
Hence the apostle, after saying, “We pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye
reconciled to God,” forthwith adds: “for He hath made Him to be sin for
us who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in
Him.” <span id="fr_1159"></span>[1160](#fn_1159) He does not say, as
some incorrect copies read, “He who knew no sin did sin for us,” as if
Christ had Himself sinned for our sakes; but he says, “Him who knew no
sin,” that is, Christ, God, to whom we are to be reconciled, “hath made
to be sin for us,” that is, hath made Him a sacrifice for our sins, by
which we might be reconciled to God. He, then, being made sin, just as
we are made righteousness (our righteousness being not our own, but
God’s, not in ourselves, but in Him); He being made sin, not His own,
but ours, not in Himself, but in us, showed, by the likeness of sinful
flesh in which He was crucified, that though sin was not in Him, yet
that in a certain sense He died to sin, by dying in the flesh which was
the likeness of sin; and that although He Himself had never lived the
old <span id="page_252">p. 252</span> <span
id="iv.ii.xliii-Page_252"></span>life of sin, yet by His resurrection He
typified our new life springing up out of the old death in sin.
