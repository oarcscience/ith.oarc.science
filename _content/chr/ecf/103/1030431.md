<span id="iv.vi.v-p1"></span> 4. For you well know that the Manichees
move the unlearned by finding fault with the Catholic Faith, and chiefly
by rending in pieces and tearing the Old Testament: and they are utterly
ignorant, how far <span id="fr_1696"></span>[1697](#fn_1696) these
things are to be taken, and how drawn out they descend with profit into
the veins and marrows of souls as yet as it were but able to cry. <span
id="fr_1697"></span>[1698](#fn_1697) And because there are in them
certain things which are some slight offense to minds ignorant and
careless of themselves, (and there are very many such,) they admit of
being accused in a popular way: but defended in a popular way they
cannot be, by any great number of persons, by reason of the mysteries
that are contained in them. But the few, who know how to do this, do not
love public and much talked of controversies and disputes: <span
id="fr_1698"></span>[1699](#fn_1698) and on this account are very little
known, save to such as are most earnest in seeking them out. Concerning
then this rashness of the Manichees, whereby they find fault with the
Old Testament and the Catholic Faith, listen, I entreat you, to the
considerations which move me. But I desire and hope that you will
receive them in the same spirit in which I say them. For God, unto Whom
are known the secrets of my conscience knows, that in this discourse I
am doing nothing of evil craft; but, as I think it should be received,
for the sake of proving the truth, for which one thing we have now long
ago determined to live; and with incredible anxiety, lest it may have
been most easy for me to err with you, but most difficult, to use no
harder term, to hold the right way with you. But I venture <span
id="fr_1699"></span>[1700](#fn_1699) to anticipate that, in this hope,
wherein I hope that you will hold with us the way of wisdom, He will not
fail me, unto Whom I have been consecrated; Whom day and night I
endeavor to gaze upon: and since, by reason of my sins, and by reason of
past habit, having the eye of the mind wounded by strokes of feeble
opinions, I know that I am without strength, I often entreat with tears,
and as, after long blindness and darkness the eyes being hardly opened,
and as yet, by frequent throbbing and turning away, refusing the light
which yet they long after; specially if one endeavor to show to them the
very sun; so it has now befallen me, who do not deny that there is a
certain unspeakable and singular good of the soul, which the mind sees;
and who with tears and groaning confess that I am not yet worthy of it.
He will not then fail me, if I feign nothing, if I am led by duty, if I
love truth, if I esteem friendship, if I fear much lest you be deceived.
