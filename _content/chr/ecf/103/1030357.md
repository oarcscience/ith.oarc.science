<span id="iv.ii.cix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.cix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 107.—Eternal Life, Though the Reward
of Good Works, is Itself the Gift of God.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.cix-p2"></span>Wherefore, even eternal life itself,
which <span id="page_272">p. 272</span> <span
id="iv.ii.cix-Page_272"></span>is surely the reward of good works, the
apostle calls the gift of God. “For the wages of sin,” he says, “is
death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our
Lord.” <span id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299) Wages (*stipendium*)
is paid as a recompense for military service; it is not a gift:
wherefore he says, “the *wages* of sin is death,” to show that death was
not inflicted undeservedly, but as the due recompense of sin. But a
gift, unless it is wholly unearned, is not a gift at all. <span
id="fr_1300"></span>[1301](#fn_1300) We are to understand, then, that
man’s good deserts are themselves the gift of God, so that when these
obtain the recompense of eternal life, it is simply grace given for
grace. Man, therefore, was thus made upright that, though unable to
remain in his uprightness without divine help, he could of his own mere
will depart from it. And whichever of these courses he had chosen, God’s
will would have been done, either by him, or concerning him. Therefore,
as he chose to do his own will rather than God’s, the will of God is
fulfilled concerning him; for God, out of one and the same heap of
perdition which constitutes the race of man, makes one vessel to honor,
another to dishonor; to honor in mercy, to dishonor in judgment; <span
id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301) that no one may glory in man, and
consequently not in himself.
