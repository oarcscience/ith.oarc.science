<span id="v.vi.ii-p1"></span> 1. A great deal for me to read hast thou
sent, my dearest brother Consentius: a great deal for me to read: to the
which while I am preparing an answer, and am drawn off first by one,
then by another, more urgent occupation, the year has measured out its
course, and has thrust me into such straits, that I must answer in what
sort I may, lest the time for sailing being now favorable, and the
bearer desirous to return, I should too long detain him. Having
therefore unrolled and read through all that Leonas, servant of God,
brought me from thee, both soon after I received it, and afterwards when
about to dictate this reply, and having weighed it with all the
consideration in my power, I am greatly delighted with thy eloquence,
and memory of the holy Scripture, and cleverness of wit, and the
resentment with which thou bitest negligent Catholics, and the zeal with
which thou gnashest against even latent heretics. But I am not persuaded
that it is right to unearth them out of their hiding places by our
telling lies. For to what end do we take such pains in tracking them out
and running them down, but that having taken them and brought them forth
into open day, we may either teach them the truth, or at least having
convicted them by the truth, may not allow them to hurt others? to this
end, therefore, that their lie may be blotted out, or shunned, and God’s
truth increased. How then by a lie shall I rightly be able to prosecute
lies? Or is it by robbery that robberies and by sacrilege that
sacrileges, and by adultery that adulteries, are to be prosecuted? “But
if the truth of God shall abound by my lie,” are we too to say, “Let us
do evil that good may come?” <span id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383)
A thing which thou seest how the Apostle detesteth. For what else is,
“Let us lie, that we may bring heretic liars to the truth,” but, “Let us
do evil that good may come?” Or, is a lie sometimes good, or sometimes a
lie not evil? Why then is it written, “Thou hatest, Lord, all that work
iniquity; Thou wilt destroy all that speak leasing.” <span
id="fr_2384"></span>[2385](#fn_2384) For he hath not excepted some, or
said indefinitely, “Thou wilt destroy them that speak leasing;” so as to
permit some, not all, to be understood: but it is an universal sentence
that he hath passed, saying, “Thou wilt destroy all who speak leasing.”
Or, be<span id="page_482">p. 482</span> <span
id="v.vi.ii-Page_482"></span>cause it is not said, Thou wilt destroy all
who speak all leasing, or, who speak any leasing whatsoever; is it
therefore to be thought that there is place allowed for some lie; to
wit, that there should be some leasing, and them who speak it, God
should not destroy, but destroy them all which speak unjust leasing, not
what lie soever, because there is found also a just lie, which as such
ought to be matter of praise, not of crime?
