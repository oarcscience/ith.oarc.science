<span id="v.ii.xiii-p1"></span> 12. For, whereas that natural use, when
it pass beyond the compact of marriage, that is, beyond the necessity of
begetting, is pardonable in the case of a wife, damnable in the case of
an harlot; that which is against nature is execrable when done in the
case of an harlot, but more execrable in the case of a wife. Of so great
power is the ordinance of the Creator, and the order of Creation, that,
in matters allowed us to use, even when the due measure is exceeded, it
is far more tolerable, than, in what are not allowed, either a single,
or rare excess. And, therefore, in a matter allowed, want of moderation,
in a husband or wife, is to be borne with, in order that lust break not
forth into a matter that is not allowed. Hence is it also that he sins
far less, who is ever so unceasing in approaches to his wife, than he
who approaches ever so seldom to commit fornication. But, when the man
shall wish to use the member of the wife not allowed for this purpose,
the wife is more shameful, if she suffer it to take place in her own
case, than if in the case of another woman. Therefore the ornament of
marriage is chastity of begetting, and faith of yielding <span

of the flesh: this is the work of marriage, this the Apostle defends
from every charge, in saying, “Both if thou shall have taken a wife,
thou hast not sinned: and if a virgin shall have been married, she
sinneth not:” and, “Let her do what she will: she sinneth not if she be
married.” <span id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969) But an advance
beyond moderation in demanding the due of either sex, for the reasons
which I have stated above, is allowed to married persons as matter of
pardon.
