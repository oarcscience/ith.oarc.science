<span id="v.iii.ix-p1"></span> 8. Therefore no fruitfulness of the flesh
can be compared to holy virginity even of the flesh. For neither is
itself also honored because it is virginity, but because it hath been
dedicated to God, and, although it be kept in the flesh, yet is it kept
by religion and devotion of the Spirit. And by this means even virginity
of body is spiritual, which continence of piety vows and keeps. For,
even as no one makes an immodest use of the body, unless the sin have
been before conceived in the spirit, so no one keeps modesty in the
body, unless chastity have been before implanted in the spirit. But,
further, if modesty of married life, although it be guarded in the
flesh, is yet attributed to the soul, not to the flesh, under the rule
and guidance of which, the flesh itself hath no intercourse with any
beside its own proper estate of marriage; how much more, and with how
much greater honor, are we to reckon among the goods of the soul that
continence, whereby the virgin purity of the flesh is vowed,
consecrated, and kept, for the Creator Himself of the soul and flesh.
