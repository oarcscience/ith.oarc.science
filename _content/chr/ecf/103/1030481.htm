<p class="c10"><a name="iv.vii.xvii-p1"></A>  17. We believe also &#8220;the resurrection of the flesh,&#8221; which went before in Christ: that the body too may have hope of that which went before in its Head. The Head of the Church, Christ: the Church, the body of Christ. Our Head is risen, ascended into heaven: where the Head, there also the members. In what way the resurrection of the flesh? Lest any should chance to think it like as Lazarus&#146;s resurrection, that thou mayest know it to be not so, it is added, &#8220;Into life everlasting.&#8221; God regenerate you! God preserve and keep you! God bring you safe unto Himself, Who is the Life Everlasting. Amen.</p>
