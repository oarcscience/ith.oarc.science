<span id="iv.ii.lxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 75.—The Wicked and the Unbelieving
are Not Made Clean by the Giving of Alms, Except They Be Born
Again.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxxvii-p2"></span>Assuredly, then, those who live in
gross wickedness, and take no care to reform their lives and manners,
and yet amid all their crimes and vices do not cease to give frequent
alms, in vain take comfort to themselves from the saying of our Lord:
“Give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean
unto you.” <span id="fr_1236"></span>[1237](#fn_1236) For they do not
understand how far this saying reaches. But that they may understand
this, let them hear what He says. For we read in the Gospel as follows:
“And as He spake, a certain Pharisee besought Him to dine with him; and
He went in, and sat down to meat. And when the Pharisee saw it, he
marvelled that He had not first washed before dinner. And the Lord said
unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the
platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness. Ye
fools, did not he that made that which is without, make that which is
within also? But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and,
behold, all things are clean unto you.” <span
id="fr_1237"></span>[1238](#fn_1237) Are we to understand this as
meaning that to the Pharisees who have not the faith of Christ all
things are clean, if only they give alms in the way these men count
almsgiving, even though they have never believed in Christ, nor been
born again of water and of the Spirit? But the fact is, that all are
unclean who are not made clean by the faith of Christ, according to the
expression, “purifying their hearts by faith;” <span
id="fr_1238"></span>[1239](#fn_1238) and that the apostle says, “Unto
them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their
mind and conscience is defiled.” <span
id="fr_1239"></span>[1240](#fn_1239) How, then, could all things be
clean to the Pharisees, even though they gave <span id="page_262">p.
262</span> <span id="iv.ii.lxxvii-Page_262"></span>alms, if they were
not believers? And how could they be believers if they were not willing
to have faith in Christ, and to be born again of His grace? And yet what
they heard is true: “Give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold,
all things are clean unto you.”
