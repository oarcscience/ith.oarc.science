<span id="v.ix.v-p1"></span> 4. “But” (say I) “in such a slaughter-heap
of dead bodies, could they not even be buried? not this, either, doth
pious faith too greatly dread, holding that which is foretold that not
even consuming beasts will be an hindrance to the rising again of bodies
of which not a hair of the head shall perish. <span
id="fr_2715"></span>[2716](#fn_2715) Nor in any wise would Truth say,
“Fear not them which kill the body, but cannot kill the soul;” if it
could at all hinder the life to come whatever enemies might choose to do
with the bodies of the slain. Unless haply any is so absurd as to
contend that they ought not to be feared before death, lest they kill
the body, but ought to be feared after death, lest, having killed the
body, they suffer it not to be buried. Is that then false which Christ
says, “Who kill the body, and afterwards have no more that they can do,”
if they have so great things that they can do on dead bodies? Far be the
thought, that that should be false which Truth hath said. For the thing
said is, that they do somewhat when they kill, because in the body there
is feeling while it is in killing, but afterward they have nothing more
that they can do because there is no feeling in the body when killed.
Many bodies, then, of Christians the earth hath not covered: but none of
them hath any separated from heaven and earth, the whole of which He
filleth with presence of Himself, Who knoweth whence to resuscitate that
which He created. It is said indeed in the Psalm, “The dead bodies of
thy servants have they given for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the
flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth: they have shed their
blood like water round about Jerusalem, and there was no man to bury
them:” <span id="fr_2716"></span>[2717](#fn_2716) but more to heighten
the cruelty of them who did these things, not to the <span
id="page_541">p. 541</span> <span id="v.ix.v-Page_541"></span>infelicity
of them who suffered them. For, however, in sight of men these things
may seem hard and dire, yet “precious in the sight of the Lord is the
death of His saints.” <span id="fr_2717"></span>[2718](#fn_2717) So,
then, all these things, care of funeral, bestowal in sepulture, pomp of
obsequies, are more for comfort of the living, than for help to the
dead. If it at all profit the ungodly to have costly sepulture, it shall
harm the godly to have vile sepulture or none. Right handsome obsequies
in sight of men did that rich man who was clad in purple receive of the
crowd of his housefolk; but far more handsome did that poor man who was
full of sores obtain of the ministry of Angels; who bore him not out
into a marble tomb, but into Abraham’s bosom bore him on high. <span
id="fr_2718"></span>[2719](#fn_2718) All this they laugh at, against
whom we have undertaken to defend the City of God: but for all that
their own philosophers, even, held care of sepulture in contempt; and
often whole armies, while dying for their earthly country, cared not
where they should after lie, or to what beasts they should become meat;
and the poets had leave to say of this matter with applause

<span id="v.ix.v-p6"></span>“though all unurn’d he lie,

<span id="v.ix.v-p7"></span>His cov’ring is the overarching sky.” <span
id="fr_2719"></span>[2720](#fn_2719)

<span id="v.ix.v-p9"></span>How much less ought they to make a vaunting
about unburied bodies of Christians, to whom the flesh itself with all
its members, re-fashioned, not only from the earth, but even from the
other elements, yea, from their most secret windings, whereinto these
evanished corpses have retired, is assured to be in an instant of time
rendered back and made entire as at the first, according to His promise?
