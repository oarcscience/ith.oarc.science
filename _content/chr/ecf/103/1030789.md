<span id="v.viii.xv-p1"></span> 14. They which say these things, do not
understand that as well each one of the wicked is in that measure for
endurance of any ills more hard, in what measure the lust of the world
is mightier in him; as also that each one of the just is in that measure
for endurance of any ills more brave, in what measure in him the love of
God is mightier. But lust of the world hath its beginning from choice of
the will, its progress from enjoyableness of pleasure, its confirmation
from the chain of custom, whereas “the love of God is shed abroad in our
hearts,” <span id="fr_2660"></span>[2661](#fn_2660) not verily from
ourselves, but “by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us.” And
therefore from Him cometh the patience of the just, by Whom is shed
abroad their love (of Him). Which love (of charity) the Apostle praising
and setting off, among its other good qualities, saith, that it “beareth
all things.” <span id="fr_2661"></span>[2662](#fn_2661) “Charity,” saith
he, “is magnanimous.” <span id="fr_2662"></span>[2663](#fn_2662) And a
little after he saith, “endureth all things.” The greater then is in
saints the charity (or love) of God, the more do they endure all things
for Him whom they love, and the greater in sinners the lust of the
world, the more do they endure all things for that which they lust
after. And consequently from that same source cometh true patience of
the righteous, from which there is in them the love of God; and from
that same source the false patience of the unrighteous, from which is in
them the lust of the world. With regard to which the Apostle John saith;
“Love not the world, neither the things that be in the world. If any man
love the world, the love of the Father is not in him: because all that
is in the world, is lust of the flesh, and lust of the eyes, and pride
of life; <span id="fr_2663"></span>[2664](#fn_2663) which is not of the
Father, but is of the world.” <span id="fr_2664"></span>[2665](#fn_2664)
This concupiscence, then, which is not of the Father, but is of the
world, in what measure it shall in any man be more vehement and ardent,
in that measure becometh each more patient of all troubles and sorrows
for that which he lusteth after. Therefore, as we said above, this is
not the patience which descendeth from above, but the patience of the
godly is from above, coming down from the Father of lights. And so that
is earthly, this heavenly; that animal, this spiritual; that devilish,
this Godlike. <span id="fr_2665"></span>[2666](#fn_2665) Because
concupiscence, whereof it cometh that persons sinning suffer all things
stubbornly, is of the world; but charity, whereof cometh that persons
living aright suffer all things bravely, is of God. And therefore to
that false patience it is possible that, without aid of God, the human
will may suffice; harder, in proportion as it is more eager of lust, and
bearing ills with the more endurance the worse itself becometh: while to
this, which is true patience, the human will, unless aided and inflamed
from above, doth not suffice, for the very reason that the Holy Spirit
is the fire thereof; by Whom unless it be kindled to love that
impassible Good, it is not able to bear the ill which it suffereth.
