<span id="v.i.xxvii-p1"></span> 27. There are also they who, in doing
open service to evil demons, contain from pleasures of the body, that,
through their means, they may satisfy unlawful pleasures, the violence
and glow whereof they contain not. Whence also, (to name one case, and
pass over the rest in silence by reason of the length of the discourse,)
certain come not near even unto their own wives, whilst, as though
clean, they essay through magic arts to gain access unto the wives of
others. O marvellous continence, nay rather, singular wickedness and
uncleanness! For, if it were true continence, the lust of the flesh
ought rather to contain from adultery, than, in order to commit
adultery, from marriage. Forsooth marriage continence is wont to ease
this lust of the flesh, and to check its curb but thus far, that neither
in marriage itself it run riot by immoderate license, but that a measure
be observed, either such as is due to the weakness of the spouse, unto
whom the Apostle enjoins not this, as of command, but yields it as of
permission; <span id="fr_1910"></span>[1911](#fn_1910) or such as is
suited for the begetting of sons, which was formerly the one alone
occasion of sexual intercourse to both holy fathers and mothers. But
continence doing this, that is, moderating, and in a certain way
limiting in married persons the lust of the flesh, and ordering in a
certain way within fixed limits its unquiet and inordinate motion, uses
well the evil of man, whom it makes and wills to make perfect good: as
God uses even evil men, for their sake whom He perfects in goodness.
