<span id="v.iv.vii-p1"></span> 6. Wherefore this in the first place you
ought to know, that by the good, which you have chosen, second marriages
are not condemned, but are set in lower honor. For, even as the good of
holy virginity, which thy daughter hath chosen, doth not condemn thy one
marriage; so neither doth thy widowhood the second marriage of any. For
hence, specially, the heresies of the Cataphryges and of the Novatians
swelled, which Tertullian also, inflated with cheeks full of sound not
of wisdom, whilst with railing tooth he attacks <span
id="fr_2229"></span>[2230](#fn_2229) second marriages, as though
unlawful, which the Apostle with sober mind allows <span
id="fr_2230"></span>[2231](#fn_2230) to be altogether lawful. From this
soundness of doctrine let no man’s reasoning, be he unlearned, or be he
learned, move thee; nor do thou so extol thy own good, as to charge as
evil that of another’s which is not evil; but do thou rejoice so much
the more of thy own good, the more thou seest, that, by it, not only are
evils shunned, but some goods too surpassed. For adultery and
fornication are evils. But from these unlawful things she is very far
removed, who hath bound herself by liberty of vow, and, not by command
of law, but by counsel of charity, hath brought to pass that even things
lawful should not be lawful to her. And marriage chastity is a good, but
widowed continence is a better good. Therefore this better good is
honored by the submission of that other, not that other condemned by the
praise of this that is better.
