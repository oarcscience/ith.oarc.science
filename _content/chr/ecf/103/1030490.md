<span id="v.i.vii-p1"></span> 7. This conflict none experience in
themselves, save such as war on the side of the virtues, and war down
the vices: nor doth any thing storm the evil of lust, save the good of
Continence. But there are, who, being utterly ignorant of the law of
God, account not evil lusts among their enemies, and through wretched
blindness being slaves to them, over and above think themselves also
blessed, by satisfying them rather than taming them. But whoso through
the Law have come to know them, (“For through the Law is the knowledge
of sin,” <span id="fr_1822"></span>[1823](#fn_1822) and, “Lust,” saith
he, “I knew not, unless the Law should say, Thou shalt not lust
after,” <span id="fr_1823"></span>[1824](#fn_1823) and yet are overcome
by their assault, because they live under the Law, whereby what is good
is commanded, but not also given: they live not under Grace, which gives
through the Holy Spirit what is commanded through the Law: unto these
the Law therefore entered, that in them the offense might abound. The
prohibition in<span id="page_382">p. 382</span> <span
id="v.i.vii-Page_382"></span>creased the lust, and made it
unconquered: <span id="fr_1824"></span>[1825](#fn_1824) that there might
be transgression also, which without the Law was not, although there was
sin, “For where there is not Law, neither is there transgression.” <span
id="fr_1825"></span>[1826](#fn_1825) Thus the Law, Grace not helping,
forbidding sin, became over and above the strength of sin; whence the
Apostle saith, “The Law is the strength of sin.” <span
id="fr_1826"></span>[1827](#fn_1826) Nor is it to be wondered at, that
man’s weakness even from the good Law added strength to evil, whilst it
trusts to fulfill the Law itself of its own strength. Forsooth being
ignorant of the righteousness of God, <span
id="fr_1827"></span>[1828](#fn_1827) which He gives unto the weak, and
wishing to establish his own, of which the weak is void, he was not made
subject to the righteousness of God, reprobate and proud. But if the
Law, as a schoolmaster, lead unto Grace one made an offender, as though
for this purpose more grievously wounded, that he may desire a
Physician; against the baneful sweetness, whereby lust prevailed, the
Lord gives a sweetness that worketh good, that by it Continence may the
more delight, and “our land giveth her fruit,” <span
id="fr_1828"></span>[1829](#fn_1828) whereby the soldier is fed, who by
the help of the Lord wars down sin.
