<span id="iv.i.iv.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—That Some Ways of Speaking
Concerning the Son are to Be Understood According to Either Rule.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.iii-p2"></span>4. There are, then, some things in the
sacred books, as I began by saying, so put, that it is doubtful to which
they are to be referred: whether to that rule whereby the Son is less on
account of His having taken the creature; or whether to that whereby it
is intimated that although equal, yet He is of the Father. And in my
opinion, if this is in such way doubtful, that which it really is can
neither be explained nor discerned, then such passages may without
danger be understood according to either rule, as that, for instance,
“My doctrine is not mine, but His that sent me.” <span
id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218) For this may both be taken according
to the form of a servant, as we have already treated it in the former
book; <span id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219) or according to the form
of God, in which He is in such way equal to the Father, that He is yet
of the Father. For according to the form of God, as the Son is not one
and His life another, but the life itself is the Son; so the Son is not
one and His doctrine another, but the doctrine itself is the Son. And
hence, as the text, “He hath given life to the Son,” is no otherwise to
be understood than, He hath begotten the Son, who is life; so also when
it is said, He hath given doctrine to the Son, it may be rightly
understood to mean, He hath begotten the Son, who is doctrine so that,
when it is said, “My doctrine is not mine, but His who sent me,” it is
so to be understood as if it were, I am not from myself, but from Him
who sent me.
