<span id="v.ii.viii-p1"></span> 7. But I marvel, if, as it is allowed to
put away a wife who is an adulteress, so it be allowed, having put her
away, to marry another. For holy Scripture causes a hard knot in this
matter, in that the Apostle says, that, by commandment of the Lord, the
wife ought not to depart from her husband, but, in case she shall have
departed, to remain unmarried, or to be reconciled to her husband; <span
id="fr_1949"></span>[1950](#fn_1949) whereas surely she ought not to
depart and remain unmarried, save from an husband that is an adulterer,
lest by withdrawing from him, who is not an adulterer, she cause him to
commit adultery. But perhaps she may justly be reconciled to her
husband, either he being to be borne with, if she cannot contain
herself, or being now corrected. But I see not how the man can have
permission to marry another, in case he have left an adulteress, when a
woman has not to be married to another, in case she have left an
adulterer. And, this being the case, so strong is that bond of
fellowship in married persons, that, although it be tied for the sake f
begetting children, not even for the sake of begetting children is it
loosed. For it is in a man’s power to put away a wife that is barren,
and marry one of whom to have children. And yet it is not allowed; and
now indeed in our times, and after the usage of Rome, neither to marry
in addition, so as to have more than one wife living: and, surely, in
case of an adulteress or adulterer being left, it would be possible that
more men should be born, if either the woman were married to another, or
the man should marry another. And yet, if this be not lawful, as the
Divine Rule seems to prescribe, who is there but it must make him
attentive to learn, what is the meaning of this so great strength of the
marriage bond? Which I by no means think could have been of so great
avail, were it not that there were taken a certain sacrament of some
greater matter from out this weak mortal state of men, so that, men
deserting it, and seeking to dissolve it, it should remain unshaken for
their punishment. Seeing that the compact of marriage is not done away
by divorce intervening; so that they continue wedded persons one to
another, even after separation; and commit adultery with those, with
whom they shall be joined, even after their own divorce, either the
woman with a man, or the man with a woman. And yet, save in the City of
our God, in His Holy Mount, the case is not such with the wife. <span
id="fr_1950"></span>[1951](#fn_1950) But, that the laws of the Gentiles
are otherwise, who is there that knows not; where, by the interposition
of divorce, without any offense of which man takes cognizance, both the
woman is married to whom she will, and the man marries whom he will. And
something like this custom, on account of the hardness of the
Israelites, Moses seems to have allowed, concerning a bill of
divorcement. <span id="fr_1951"></span>[1952](#fn_1951) In which matter
there appears rather a rebuke, than an approval, of divorce. <span
id="fr_1952"></span>[1953](#fn_1952)
