<span id="v.iii.xliii-p1"></span> 42. Wherefore let this be the first
thought for the putting on of humility, that God’s virgin think not that
it is of herself that she is such, and not rather that this best “gift
cometh down from above from the Father of Lights, with Whom is no change
nor shadow of motion.” <span id="fr_2171"></span>[2172](#fn_2171) For
thus she will not think that little hath been forgiven her, so as for
her to love little, and, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and
wishing to establish her own, not to be made subject to the
righteousness of God. In which fault was that Simon who was surpassed by
the woman, unto whom many sins were forgiven, because she loved much.
But she will have more cautious and true thoughts, that we are so to
account all sins as though forgiven, from which God keeps us that we
commit them not. Witnesses are those expressions of pious prayers in
holy Scriptures, whereby it is shown, that those very things, which are
commanded by God, are not done save by His Gift and help, Who commands.
For there is a falsehood in the asking for them, if we could do them
without the help of His grace. What is there so generally and chiefly
charged, as obedience whereby the Commandments of God are kept? And yet
we find this wished for. “Thou,” saith he, “hast charged, that Thy
commandments be greatly kept.” Then it follows, “O that my ways were
directed to keep Thy righteousnesses: then shall I not be confounded,
whilst I look unto all Thy commandments.” <span
id="fr_2172"></span>[2173](#fn_2172) That which he had set down above
that God had commanded, that he wished might of himself be fulfilled.
This is done assuredly, that there be not sin; but, if there hath been
sin, the command is that one repent; lest by defense and excuse of sin
he perish through pride, who hath done it, whilst he is unwilling that
what he hath done perish through repentance. This also is asked of God,
so that it may be understood that it is not done, save by His grant from
Whom it is asked. “Set,” saith he, “O Lord, a watch to my mouth, and a
door of continence around my lips: let not my heart turn away unto evil
words, to make excuses in sins, with men that work
unrighteousness.” <span id="fr_2173"></span>[2174](#fn_2173) If,
therefore, both obedience, whereby we keep His commandments, and
repentance whereby we excuse not our sins, are wished for and asked, it
is plain that, when it is done, it is by His gift that it is possessed,
by His help that it is fulfilled, yet more openly is it said by reason
of obedience, “By the Lord the steps of a man are directed, and He shall
will His way:” <span id="fr_2174"></span>[2175](#fn_2174) and of
repentance the Apostle says, “if haply God may grant unto them
repentance.” <span id="fr_2175"></span>[2176](#fn_2175)
