<span id="v.iv.v-p1"></span> 4. Lo, there is your good compared to that
good, which the Apostle calls his own, if faith be present: yea, rather,
because faith is present. Short is this teaching, yet not on this
account to be despised, because it is short; but on this account to be
retained the more easily and the more dearly, in that in shortness it is
not cheap. For it is not every kind of good soever, which the Apostle
would here set forth, which he hath unambiguously placed above the faith
of married women. But how great good the faith of married women, that
is, of Christian and religious women joined in marriage, hath, may be
understood from this, that, when he was giving charge for the avoiding
of fornication, wherein assuredly he was addressing married persons
also, he saith, “Know ye not that your bodies are the members of
Christ?” <span id="fr_2225"></span>[2226](#fn_2225) So great then is the
good of faithful marriage, that even the very members are (members) of
Christ. But, forasmuch as the good of widowed continence is better than
this good, the purpose of this profession is, not that a catholic widow
be any thing more than a member of Christ, but that she have a better
place, than a married woman, among the members of Christ. Forsooth the
same Apostle says, “For, as in one body we have many members, but all
members have not the same course of action; so being many we are one
body in Christ, and each members one of another: having gifts diverse
according unto the grace, which hath been given unto us.” <span
