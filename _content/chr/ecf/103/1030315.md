id="iv.ii.lxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 65.—God Pardons Sins, But on
Condition of Penitence, Certain Times for Which Have Been Fixed by the
Law of the Church.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxvii-p2"></span>But even crimes themselves, however
great, may be remitted in the Holy Church; and the mercy of God is never
to be despaired of by men who truly repent, each according to the
measure of his sin. And in the act of repentance, where a crime has been
committed of such a nature as to cut off the sinner from the body of
Christ, we are not to take account so much of the measure of time as of
the measure of sorrow; for a broken and a contrite heart God doth not
despise. <span id="fr_1211"></span>[1212](#fn_1211) But as the grief of
one heart is frequently hid from another, and is not made known to
others by words or other signs, when it is manifest to Him of whom it is
said, “My groaning is not hid from Thee,” <span
id="fr_1212"></span>[1213](#fn_1212) those who govern the Church have
rightly appointed times of penitence, that the Church in which the sins
are remitted may be satisfied; and outside the Church sins are not
remitted. For the Church alone has received the pledge of the Holy
Spirit, without which there is no remission of sins—such, at least, as
brings the pardoned to eternal life.
