<span id="v.vi.xxxi-p1"></span> 30. But why do these persons think they
may imitate Tamar telling a lie, and not think they may imitate Judah
committing fornication? <span id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439) For
there they have read both, and nought of these hath that Scripture
either blamed or praised, but has merely narrated both, and to our
judgment dismissed both: but it is marvellous if it hath permitted aught
of these to be imitated with impunity. For, that Tamar not through lust
of playing the harlot, but through wish of conceiving seed, did tell the
lie, we know. But fornication also, howbeit Judah’s was not such, yet
some man’s may be such whereby to procure that a man may be delivered,
just as her lie was in order that a man might be conceived; is it right
then to commit fornication on this account, if on that account it is
thought that it was right to lie? Not therefore concerning lying only,
but concerning all works of men in which there arise as it were
compensative sins, must we consider what sentence we ought to pass; lest
we open a way not only to small sins whatsoever, but even to all
wickednesses, and there remain no outrageous, flagitious, sacrilegious
deed, in which there may not arise a cause upon which it may rightly
seem a thing meet to be done, and so universal probity of life be by
that opinion subverted.
