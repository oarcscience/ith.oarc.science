<span id="iv.i.vi.i-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.vi.i-p1.1"></span>Preface.—The Knowledge of God is to Be Sought
from God.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vi.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.i.vi.i-p2.1"></span> The</span>knowledge of things terrestrial
and celestial is commonly thought much of by men. Yet those doubtless
judge better who prefer to that knowledge, the knowledge of themselves;
and that mind is more praiseworthy which knows even its own weakness,
than that which, without regard to this, searches out, and even comes to
know, the ways of the stars, or which holds fast such knowledge already
acquired, while ignorant of the way by which itself to enter into its
own proper health and strength. But if any one has already become awake
towards God, kindled by the warmth of the Holy Spirit, and in the love
of God has become vile in his own eyes; and through wishing, yet not
having strength to come in unto Him, and through the light He gives, has
given heed to himself, and has found himself, and has learned that his
own filthiness cannot mingle with His purity; and feels it sweet to weep
and to entreat Him, that again and again He will have compassion, until
he have put off all his wretchedness; and to pray confidently, as having
already received of free gift the pledge of salvation through his only
Saviour and Enlightener of man:—such an one, so acting, and so
lamenting, knowledge does not puff up, because charity edifieth; <span
id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437) for he has preferred knowledge to
knowledge, he has preferred to know his own weakness, rather than to
know the walls of the world, the foundations of the earth, and the
pinnacles of heaven. And by obtaining this knowledge, he has obtained
also sorrow; <span id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438) but sorrow for
straying away from the desire of reaching his own proper country, and
the Creator of it, his own blessed God. And if among men such as these,
in the family of Thy Christ, O Lord my God, I groan among Thy poor, give
me out of Thy bread to answer men who do not hunger and thirst after
righteousness, but are sated and abound. <span
id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439) But it is the vain image of those
things that has sated them, not Thy truth, which they have repelled and
shrunk from, and so fall into their own vanity. I certainly know how
many figments the human heart gives birth to. And what is my own heart
but a human heart? But I <span id="page_70">p. 70</span> <span
id="iv.i.vi.i-Page_70"></span>pray the God of my heart, that I may not
vomit forth (*eructuem*) into these writings any of these figments for
solid truths, but that there may pass into them only what the breath of
His truth has breathed into me; cast out though I am from the sight of
His eyes, <span id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440) and striving from afar
to return by the way which the divinity of His only-begotten Son has
made by His humanity. And this truth, changeable though I am, I so far
drink in, as far as in it I see nothing changeable: neither in place and
time, as is the case with bodies; nor in time alone, and in a certain
sense place, as with the thoughts of our own spirits; nor in time alone,
and not even in any semblance of place, as with some of the reasonings
of our own minds. For the essence of God, whereby He is, has altogether
nothing changeable, neither in eternity, nor in truth, nor in will;
since there truth is eternal, love eternal; and there love is true,
eternity true; and there eternity is loved, and truth is loved.
