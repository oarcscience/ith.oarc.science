<span id="v.ii.xx-p1"></span> 19. Therefore as many women as there are
now, unto whom it is said, “if they contain not, let them be
married, <span id="fr_1985"></span>[1986](#fn_1985) ” are not to be
compared to the holy women then, even when they married. Marriage itself
indeed in all nations is for the same cause of begetting sons, and of
what character soever these may be afterward, yet was marriage for this
purpose instituted, that they may be born in due and honest order. But
men, who contain not, as it were ascend unto marriage by a step of
honesty: but they, who without doubt would contain, if the purpose of
that time had allowed this, in a certain measure descended unto marriage
by a step of piety. And, on this account, although the marriages of
both, so far as they are marriages, in that they are for the sake of
begetting, are equally good, yet these men when married are not to be
compared with those men as married. For these have, what is allowed them
by the way of leave, on account of the honesty of marriage, although it
pertain not to marriage; that is, the advance which goes beyond the
necessity of begetting, which they had not. But neither can these, if
haply there be now any found, who neither seek, nor desire, in marriage
any thing, save that wherefore marriage was instituted, be made equal to
those men. For in these the very desire of sons is carnal, but in those
it was spiritual, in that it was suited to the sacrament of that time.
Forsooth now no one who is made perfect in piety seeks to have sons,
save after a spiritual sense; but then it was the work of piety itself
to beget sons even after a carnal sense: in that the begetting of that
people was fraught with tidings of things to come, and pertained unto
the prophetic dispensation.
