<span id="v.iii.xvii-p1"></span> 16. Yet he added, “But such shall have
tribulation of the flesh, but I spare you:” <span
id="fr_2052"></span>[2053](#fn_2052) in this manner exhorting unto
virginity, and continual continence, so as some little to alarm also
from marriage, with all modesty, not as from a matter evil and unlawful,
but as from one burdensome and troublesome. For it is one thing to incur
dishonor of the flesh, and another to have tribulation of the flesh: the
<span id="page_422">p. 422</span> <span
id="v.iii.xvii-Page_422"></span>one is matter of crime to do, the other
of labor to suffer, which for the most part men refuse not even for the
most honorable duties. But for the having of marriage, now at this time,
wherein there is no service done unto Christ about to come through
descent of flesh by the begetting of the family itself, to take upon one
to bear that tribulation of the flesh, which the Apostle foretells to
such as shall be married, would be extremely foolish, did not
incontinent persons fear, lest, through the temptation of Satan, they
should fall into damnable sins. But whereas he says that he spares them,
who he saith will have tribulation of the flesh, there suggests itself
to me in the mean while no sounder interpretation, than that he was
unwilling to open, and unfold in words, this self-same tribulation of
the flesh which he fore-announced to those who choose marriage, in
suspicions of jealousy of married life, in the begetting and nurture of
children, in fears and sorrows of childlessness. For how very few, after
they have bound themselves with the bonds of marriage, are not drawn and
driven to and fro by these feelings? And this we ought not to
exaggerate, lest we spare not the very persons, who the Apostle thought
were to be spared.
