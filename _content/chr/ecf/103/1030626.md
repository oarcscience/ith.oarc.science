<span id="v.iv.xiv-p1"></span> 13. Wherefore they who say that the
marriages of such are not marriages, but rather adulteries, seem not to
me to consider with sufficient acuteness and care what they say;
forsooth they, are misled by a semblance of truth. For, whereas they,
who of Christian sanctity marry not, are said to choose the marriage of
Christ, hence certain argue saying, If she, who during the life of her
husband is married to another, be an adulteress, even as the Lord
Himself hath laid down in the Gospel; therefore, during the life of
Christ, over Whom death hath no more dominion, <span
id="fr_2251"></span>[2252](#fn_2251) if she who had chosen His marriage,
be married to a man, she is an adulteress. They, who say this, are moved
indeed with acuteness, but fail to observe, how great absurdity in fact
follows on this reasoning. For whereas it is praiseworthy that, even
during the life of her husband, by his consent, a female vow continence
unto Christ, now, according to the reasoning of these persons, no one
ought to do this, lest she make Christ Himself, what is impious to
imagine, an adulterer, by being married to Him during the life of her
husband. Next, whereas first marriages are of better desert than second,
far be it that this be the thought of holy widows, that Christ seem unto
them as a second husband. For Himself they used heretofore also to have,
(when they were subject and did faithful service to their own husbands,)
not after the flesh, but after the Spirit a Husband; unto Whom the
Church herself, of which they are members, is the wife; who by soundness
of faith, of hope, of charity, not in the virgins alone, but in widows
also, and faithful married women, is altogether a virgin. Forsooth unto
the universal Church, of which they all are members, the Apostle saith,
“I joined you unto one husband a chaste virgin to present unto
Christ.” <span id="fr_2252"></span>[2253](#fn_2252) But He knoweth how
to make fruitful, without marring of chastity, a wife a virgin, Whom
even in the flesh itself His Mother could without violation of chastity
conceive. But there is brought to pass by means of this ill-considered
notion, (whereby they think that the marriages of women who have fallen
away from this holy purpose, in case they shall have married, are no
marriages,) no small evil, that wives be separated from their husbands,
as though they were adulteresses, not wives; and wishing to restore to
continence the women thus separated, they make their husbands real
adulterers, in that during the life of their wives they have married
others.
