<span id="iv.i.xiv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xiv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—The Image of the Beast in
Man.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xiv.xi-p2"></span>16. For as a snake does not creep on
with open steps, but advances by the very minutest efforts of its
several scales; so the slippery motion of falling away \[from what is
good\] takes possession of the negligent only gradually, and beginning
from a perverse desire for the likeness of God, arrives in the end at
the likeness of beasts. Hence it is that being naked of their first
garment, they earned by mortality coats of skins. <span
id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770) For the true honor of man is the image
and likeness of God, which is not preserved except it be in relation to
Him by whom it is impressed. The less therefore that one loves what is
one’s own, the more one cleaves to God. But through the desire of making
trial of his own power, man by his own bidding falls down to himself as
to a sort of intermediate grade. And so, while he wishes to be as God
is, that is, under no one, he is thrust on, even from his own middle
grade, by way of punishment, to that which is lowest, that is, to those
things in which beasts delight: and thus, while his honor is the
likeness of God, but his dishonor is the likeness of the beast, “Man
being in honor abideth not: he is compared to the beasts that are
foolish, and is made like to them.” <span
id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771) By what path, then, could he pass so
great a distance from the highest to the lowest, except through his own
intermediate grade? For when he neglects the love of wisdom, which
remains always after the same fashion, and lusts after knowledge by
experiment upon things temporal and mutable, that knowledge puffeth up,
it does not edify: <span id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772) so the mind
is overweighed and thrust out, as it were, by its own weight from
blessedness; and learns by its own punishment, through that trial of its
own intermediateness, what the difference is between the good it has
abandoned and the bad to which it has committed itself; and having
thrown away and destroyed its strength, it cannot return, unless by the
grace of its Maker calling it to repentance, and forgiving its sins. For
who will deliver the unhappy soul from the body of this death, unless
the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord? <span
id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773) of which grace we will discourse in
its place, so far as He Himself enables us.
