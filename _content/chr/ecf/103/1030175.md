<span id="iv.i.xiv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xiv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—The Opinion of Those Who Have
Thought that the Mind Was Signified by the Man, the Bodily Sense by the
Woman.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xiv.xiii-p2"></span>20. Nor does it escape me, that some
who before us were eminent defenders of the Catholic faith and
expounders of the word of God, while they looked for these two things in
one human being, whose entire soul they perceived to be a sort of
excellent paradise, asserted that the man was the mind, but that the
woman was the bodily sense. And according to this distribution, by which
the man is assumed to be the mind, but the woman the bodily sense, all
things seem aptly to agree together if they are handled with due
attention: unless that it is written, that in all the beasts and flying
things there was not found for man an helpmate like to himself; and then
the woman was made out of his side. <span
id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779) And on this account I, for my part,
have not thought that the bodily sense should be taken for the woman,
which we see to be common to our<span id="page_163">p. 163</span> <span
id="iv.i.xiv.xiii-Page_163"></span>selves and to the beasts; but I have
desired to find something which the beasts had not; and I have rather
thought the bodily sense should be understood to be the serpent, whom we
read to have been more subtle than all beasts of the field. <span
id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780) For in those natural good things which
we see are common to ourselves and to the irrational animals, the sense
excels by a kind of living power; not the sense of which it is written
in the epistle addressed to the Hebrews, where we read, that “strong
meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of
use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil;” <span
id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781) for these “senses” belong to the
rational nature and pertain to the understanding; but that sense which
is divided into five parts in the body, through which corporeal species
and motion is perceived not only by ourselves, but also by the beasts.

<span id="iv.i.xiv.xiii-p6"></span>21. But whether that the apostle
calls the man the image and glory of God, but the woman the glory of the
man, <span id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782) is to be received in this,
or that, or in any other way; yet it is clear, that when we live
according to God, our mind which is intent on the invisible things of
Him ought to be fashioned with proficiency from His eternity, truth,
charity; but that something of our own rational purpose, that is, of the
same mind, must be directed to the using of changeable and corporeal
things, without which this life does not go on; not that we may be
conformed to this world, <span id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783) by
placing our end in such good things, and by forcing the desire of
blessedness towards them, but that whatever we do rationally in the
using of temporal things, we may do it with the contemplation of
attaining eternal things, passing through the former, but cleaving to
the latter.
