<span id="v.iv.ix-p1"></span> 8. Whence, also, what the Apostle Paul
said of the unmarried woman, “that she may be holy both in body and
spirit;” <span id="fr_2236"></span>[2237](#fn_2236) we are not so to
understand, as though a faithful woman being married and chaste, and
according to the Scriptures subject unto her husband, be not holy in
body, but only in spirit. For it cannot come to pass, that when the
spirit is sanctified, the body also be not holy, of which the sanctified
spirit maketh use: but, that we seem not to any to argue rather than
<span id="page_444">p. 444</span> <span id="v.iv.ix-Page_444"></span>to
prove this by divine saying; since the Apostle Peter, making mention of
Sarah, saith only “holy women,” and saith not, “and in body;” let us
consider that saying of the same Paul, where forbidding fornication he
saith, “Know ye not, that your bodies are members of Christ? Taking,
therefore, members of Christ, shall I make them members of an harlot?
Far be it.” <span id="fr_2237"></span>[2238](#fn_2237) Therefore let any
one dare to say that the members of Christ are not holy; or let him not
dare to separate from the members of Christ the bodies of the faithful
that are married. Whence, also, a little after he saith, “Your body is
the temple within you of the Holy Spirit, Whom ye have from God; and ye
are not your own; for ye have been bought with a great price.” <span
id="fr_2238"></span>[2239](#fn_2238) He saith that the body of the
faithful is both members of Christ, and the temple of the Holy Spirit,
wherein assuredly the faithful of both sexes are understood. There
therefore are married women, there unmarried women also; but distinct in
their deserts, and as members preferred to members, whilst yet neither
are separated from the body. Whereas, therefore, he saith, speaking of
an unmarried woman, “that she may be holy both in body and spirit,” he
would have understood a fuller sanctification both in body and in
spirit, and hath not deprived the body of married women of all
sanctification.
