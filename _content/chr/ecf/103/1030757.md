<span id="v.vii.xxvi-p1"></span> 25. If at the least they once had in
this world wherewithal they might easily without handiwork sustain this
life, which property, when they were converted unto God, they disparted
to the needy, then must we both believe their infirmity, and bear with
it. For usually such persons, having been, not better brought up, as
many think, but what is the truth, more languidly brought up, are not
able to bear the labor of bodily works. Such peradventure were many in
Jerusalem. For it is also written, that they sold their houses and
lands, and laid the prices of them at the Apostles’ feet, that
distribution might be made to every one as he had need. <span
id="fr_2556"></span>[2557](#fn_2556) Because they were found, being
near, and were useful to the Gentiles, who, being afar off, <span
id="fr_2557"></span>[2558](#fn_2557) were thence called from the worship
of idols, as it is said, “Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the
word of the Lord from Jerusalem,” <span
id="fr_2558"></span>[2559](#fn_2558) therefore hath the Apostle called
the Christians of the Gentiles their debtors: “their debtors,” saith he,
“they are:” and hath added the reason why, “For if in their spiritual
things the Gentiles have communicated, they ought also in carnal things
to minister unto them.” <span id="fr_2559"></span>[2560](#fn_2559) But
now there come into this profession of the service of God, both persons
from the condition of slaves, or also freed-men, or persons on this
account freed by their masters or about to be freed, likewise from the
life of peasants, and from the exercise and plebeian labor of
handicraftsmen, persons whose bringing up doubtless has been all the
better for them, the harder it has been: whom not to admit, is a heavy
sin. For many of that sort have turned out truly great men and meet to
be imitated. For on this account also “hath God chosen the weak things
of the world to confound the things which are mighty, and the foolish
things of the world hath He chosen to confound them who are wise; and
ignoble things of the world, and things which are not, as though they
were, that the things that are may be brought to nought: that no flesh
may glory before God.” <span id="fr_2560"></span>[2561](#fn_2560) This
pious and holy thought, accordingly, causeth that even such be admitted
as bring no proof of a change of life for the better. For it doth not
appear whether they come of purpose for the service of God, or whether
running away empty from a poor and laborious life they want to be fed
and clothed; yea, moreover, to be honored by them of whom they were wont
to be despised and trampled on. Such persons therefore because they
cannot excuse themselves from working by pleading infirmity of body,
seeing they are convicted by the custom of their past life, do therefore
shelter themselves under the screen of an ill scholarship, that from the
Gospel badly understood they should essay to pervert precepts
apostolical: truly “fowls of the air,” but in lifting themselves on high
through pride; and “grass of the field,” but in being carnally minded.
