What They Ought to Do Who Do Not Understand These Things.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-p2"></A>48. But because it is most difficult to distinguish generation from procession in that co-eternal, and equal, and incorporeal, and ineffably unchangeable and indivisible Trinity, let it suffice meanwhile to put before those who are not able to be drawn on further, what we said upon this subject in a sermon to be delivered in the ears of Christian people, and after saying wrote it down. For when, among other things, I had taught them by testimonies of the Holy Scriptures that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both, I continue: &#8220;If, then, the Holy Spirit proceeds both from the Father and from the Son, why did the Son say, &#145;He proceedeth from the Father?&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1069"></A><A HREF="#fn_1069"><FONT SIZE="1">1070</FONT></A>
 Why, think you, except as He is wont to refer to Him, that also which is His <A NAME="page_226"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 226</FONT></A> <a name="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-Page_226"></A>own, from whom also He Himself is? Whence also is that which He saith, &#145;My doctrine is not mine own, but His that sent me?&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1070"></A><A HREF="#fn_1070"><FONT SIZE="1">1071</FONT></A>
 If, therefore, it is His doctrine that is here understood, which yet He said was not His own, but His that sent Him, how much more is it there to be understood that the Holy Spirit proceeds also from Himself, where He so says, He proceedeth from the Father, as not to say, He proceedeth not from me? From Him, certainly, from whom the Son had his Divine nature, for He is God of God, He has also, that from Him too proceeds the Holy Spirit; and hence the Holy Spirit has from the Father Himself, that He should proceed from the Son also, as He proceeds from the Father. Here, too, in some way may this also be understood, so far as it can be understood by such as we are, why the Holy Spirit is not said to be born, but rather to proceed;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1071"></A><A HREF="#fn_1071"><FONT SIZE="1">1072</FONT></A>
 since if He, too, was called a Son, He would certainly be called the Son of both, which is most absurd, since no one is son of two, save of father and mother. But far be it from us to surmise any such thing as this between God the Father and God the Son. Because not even the son of men proceeds at the same time from both father and mother; but when he proceeds from the father into the mother, he does not at that time proceed from the mother; and when he proceeds from the mother into this present light, he does not at that time proceed from the father. But the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Father into the Son, and from the Son proceed to sanctify the creature, but proceeds at once from both; although the Father has given this to the Son, that He should proceed, as from Himself, so also from Him. For we cannot say that the Holy Spirit is not life, while the Father is life, and the Son is life: and hence as the Father, while He has life in Himself, has given also to the Son to have life in Himself; so has He given also to Him that life should proceed from Him, as it also proceeds from Himself.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1072"></A><A HREF="#fn_1072"><FONT SIZE="1">1073</FONT></A>
 I have transferred this from that sermon into this book, but I was speaking to believers, not to unbelievers.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-p7"></A>49. But if they are not competent to gaze upon this image, and to see how true these things are which are in their mind, and yet which are not so three as to be three persons, but all three belong to a man who is one person; why do they not believe what they find in the sacred books respecting that highest Trinity which is God, rather than insist on the clearest reason being rendered them, which cannot be comprehended by the human mind, dull and infirm as it is? And to be sure, when they have steadfastly believed the Holy Scriptures as most true witnesses, let them strive, by praying and seeking and living well, that they may understand, <i>i.e.</i> that so far as it can be seen, that may be seen by the mind which is held fast by faith. Who would forbid this? Nay, who would not rather exhort them to it? But if they think they ought to deny that these things are, because they, with their blind minds, cannot discern them, they, too, who are blind from their birth, ought to deny that there is a sun. The light then shineth in darkness; but if the darkness comprehend it not,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1073"></A><A HREF="#fn_1073"><FONT SIZE="1">1074</FONT></A>
 let them first be illuminated by the gift of God, that they may be believers, and let them begin to be light in comparison with the unbelievers; and when this foundation is first laid, let them be built up to see what they believe, that at some time they may be able to see. For some things are so believed, that they cannot be seen at all. For Christ is not to be seen a second time on the cross; but unless this be believed which has been so done and seen, that it is not now to be hoped for as about to be and to be seen, there is no coming to Christ, such as without end He is to be seen. But as far as relates to the discerning in some way by the understanding that highest, ineffable, incorporeal, and unchangeable nature the sight of the human mind can nowhere better exercise itself, so only that the rule of faith govern it, than in that which man himself has in his own nature better than the other animals, better also than the other parts of his own soul, which is the mind itself, to which has been assigned a certain sight of things invisible, and to which, as though honorably presiding in a higher and inner place, the bodily senses also bring word of all things, that they may be judged, and than which there is no higher, to which it is to be subject, and by which it is to be governed, except God.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-p9"></A>50. But among these many things which I have now said, and of which there is nothing <A NAME="page_227"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 227</FONT></A> <a name="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-Page_227"></A>that I dare to profess myself to have said worthy of the ineffableness of that highest Trinity, but rather to confess that the wonderful knowledge of Him is too great for me, and that I cannot attain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1074"></A><A HREF="#fn_1074"><FONT SIZE="1">1075</FONT></A>
 to it: O thou, my soul, where dost thou feel thyself to be? where dost thou lie? where dost thou stand? until all thy infirmities be healed by Him who has forgiven all thy iniquities.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1075"></A><A HREF="#fn_1075"><FONT SIZE="1">1076</FONT></A>
 Thou perceivest thyself assuredly to be in that inn whither that Samaritan brought him whom he found with many wounds inflicted by thieves, half-dead.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1076"></A><A HREF="#fn_1076"><FONT SIZE="1">1077</FONT></A>
 And yet thou hast seen many things that are true, not by those eyes by which colored objects are seen, but by those for which he prayed who said, &#8220;Let mine eyes behold the things that are equal.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1077"></A><A HREF="#fn_1077"><FONT SIZE="1">1078</FONT></A>
 Certainly, then, thou hast seen many things that are true, and hast distinguished them from that light by the light of which thou hast seen them. Lift up thine eyes to the light itself, and fix them upon it if thou canst. For so thou wilt see how the birth of the Word of God differs from the procession of the Gift of God, on account of which the only-begotten Son did not say that the Holy Spirit is begotten of the Father, otherwise He would be His brother, but that lie proceeds from Him. Whence, since the Spirit of both is a kind of consubstantial communion of Father and Son, He is not called, far be it from us to say so, the Son of both. But thou canst not fix thy sight there, so as to discern this lucidly and clearly; I know thou canst not. I say the truth, I say to myself, I know what I cannot do; yet that light itself shows to thee these three things in thyself, wherein thou mayest recognize an image of the highest Trinity itself, which thou canst not yet contemplate with steady eye. Itself shows to thee that there is in thee a true word, when it is born of thy knowledge, <i>i.e.</i> when we say what we know: although we neither utter nor think of any articulate word that is significant in any tongue of any nation, but our thought is formed by that which we know; and there is in the mind&#146;s eye of the thinker an image resembling that thought which the memory contained, will or love as a third combining these two as parent and offspring. And he who can, sees and discerns that this will proceeds indeed from thought (for no one wills that of which he is absolutely ignorant what or of what sort it is), yet is not an image of the thought: and so that there is insinuated in this intelligible thing a sort of difference between birth and procession, since to behold by thought is not the same as to desire, or even to enjoy will. Thou, too, hast been able [to discern this], although thou hast not been, neither art, able to unfold with adequate speech what, amidst the clouds of bodily likenesses, which cease not to flit up and down before human thoughts, thou hast scarcely seen. But that light which is not thyself shows thee this too, that these incorporeal likenesses of bodies are different from the truth, which, by rejecting them, we contemplate with the understanding. These, and other things similarly certain, that light hath shown to thine inner eyes. What reason, then, is there why thou canst not see that light itself with steady eye, except certainly infirmity? And what has produced this in thee, except iniquity? Who, then, is it that healeth all thine infirmities, unless it be He that forgiveth all thine iniquities? And therefore I will now at length finish this book by a prayer better than by an argument.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-p5"></A> [Generation and procession are each an emanation of the essence by which it is modified. Neither of them is a creation <i>ex nihilo</i>. The school-men attempted to explain the difference between the two emanations, by saying that the generation of the Son is by the mode of the intellect&#8212;hence the Son is called Wisdom, or Word (Logos); but the procession of the Spirit is by the mode of the will&#8212;hence the Spirit is called Love. Turrettin distinguishes the difference by the following particulars: 1. In respect to the source. Generation is from the Father alone; procession is from Father and Son. 2. In respect to effects. Generation yields not only personality, but resemblance. The Son is the &#8220;image&#8221; of the Father, but the Spirit is not the image of the Father and Son. Generation is accompanied with the power to communicate the essence; procession is not. 3. In respect to order of relationship. Generation is second, procession is third. In the order of nature, not of time (for both generation and procession are eternal, therefore simultaneous), procession is after generation. <i>Institutio</i> III. xxxi. 3.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p>
