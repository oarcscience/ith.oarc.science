<p class="c39"><a name="iv.i.iii.xii-p1"></A>  <span class="c2"><a name="iv.i.iii.xii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 12.&#8212;In What Manner the Son is Said Not to Know the Day and the Hour Which the Father Knows. Some Things Said of Christ According to the Form of God, Other Things According to the Form of a Servant. In What Way It is of Christ to Give the Kingdom, in What Not of Christ. Christ Will Both Judge and Not Judge.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.i.iii.xii-p2"></A>Again, &#8220;Of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven; neither the Son, but the Father.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">136</FONT></A>
 For He is ignorant of this, as <i> making others ignorant</i>; that is, in that He did not so know as at that time to show His disciples:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">137</FONT></A>
 as it was said to Abraham, &#8220;Now I know that thou fearest God,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">138</FONT></A>
 that is, now I have caused thee to know it; because he himself, being tried in that temptation, became known to himself. For He was certainly going to tell this same thing to His disciples at the fitting time; speaking of which yet future as if past, He says, &#8220;Henceforth I call you not servants, but friends; for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">139</FONT></A>
 which He had not yet done, but spoke as though He had already done it, because He certainly would do it. For He says to the disciples themselves, &#8220;I have yet many things to say unto you; but ye cannot bear them now.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">140</FONT></A>
 Among which is to be understood also, &#8220;Of the day and hour.&#8221; For the apostle also says, &#8220;I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">141</FONT></A>
 because he was speaking to those who were not able to receive higher things concerning the Godhead of Christ. To whom also a little while after he says, &#8220;I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_141"><FONT SIZE="1">142</FONT></A>
 He was &#8220;ignorant,&#8221; therefore, among them of that which they were not able to know from him. And that only he said that he knew, which it was fitting that they should know from him. In short, he knew among the perfect what he knew not among babes; for he there says: &#8220;We speak wisdom among them that are perfect.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">143</FONT></A>
 For a man is said <A NAME="page_31"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 31</FONT></A> <a name="iv.i.iii.xii-Page_31"></A>not to know what he hides, after that kind of speech, after which a ditch is called blind which is hidden. For the Scriptures do not use any other kind of speech than may be found in use among men, because they speak to men.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.i.iii.xii-p11"></A>24. According to the form of God, it is said &#8220;Before all the hills He begat me,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">144</FONT></A>
 that is, before all the loftinesses of things created and, &#8220;Before the dawn I begat Thee,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">145</FONT></A>
 that is, before all times and temporal things: but according to the form of a servant, it is said, &#8220;The Lord created me in the beginning of His ways.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">146</FONT></A>
 Because, according to the form of God, He said, &#8220;I am the truth;&#8221; and according to the form of a servant, &#8220;I am the way.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">147</FONT></A>
 For, because He Himself, being the first-begotten of the dead,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_147"></A><A HREF="#fn_147"><FONT SIZE="1">148</FONT></A>
 made a passage to the kingdom of God to life eternal for His Church, to which He is so the Head as to make the body also immortal, therefore He was &#8220;created in the beginning of the ways&#8221; of God in His work. For, according to the form of God, He is the beginning,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_148"><FONT SIZE="1">149</FONT></A>
 that also speaketh unto us, in which &#8220;beginning&#8221; God created the heaven and the earth;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">150</FONT></A>
 but according to the form of a servant, &#8220;He is a bridegroom coming out of His chamber.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_150"></A><A HREF="#fn_150"><FONT SIZE="1">151</FONT></A>
 According to the form of God, &#8220;He is the first-born of every creature, and He is before all things and by him all things consist;&#8221; according to the form of a servant, &#8220;He is the head of the body, the Church.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_151"></A><A HREF="#fn_151"><FONT SIZE="1">152</FONT></A>
 According to the form of God, &#8220;He is the Lord of glory.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_152"></A><A HREF="#fn_152"><FONT SIZE="1">153</FONT></A>
 From which it is evident that He Himself glorifies His saints: for, &#8220;Whom He did predestinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He justified, them He also glorified.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_153"></A><A HREF="#fn_153"><FONT SIZE="1">154</FONT></A>
 Of Him accordingly it is said, that He justifieth the ungodly;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_154"></A><A HREF="#fn_154"><FONT SIZE="1">155</FONT></A>
 of Him it is said, that He is just and a justifier.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_155"></A><A HREF="#fn_155"><FONT SIZE="1">156</FONT></A>
 If, therefore, He has also glorified those whom He has justified, He who justifies, Himself also glorifies; who is, as I have said, the Lord of glory. Yet, according to the form of a servant, He replied to His disciples, when inquiring about their own glorification: &#8220;To sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give, but [it shall be given to them] for whom it is prepared by my Father.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_156"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">157</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.i.iii.xii-p26"></A>25. But that which is prepared by His Father is prepared also by the Son Himself, because He and the Father are one.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_157"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">158</FONT></A>
 For we have already shown, by many modes of speech in the divine Scriptures, that, in this Trinity, what is said of each is also said of all, on account of the indivisible working of the one and same substance. As He also says of the Holy Spirit, &#8220;If I depart, I will send Him unto you.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">159</FONT></A>
 He did not say, <i>We</i> will send; but in such way as if the Son only should send Him, and not the Father; while yet He says in another place, &#8220;These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you; but the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, He shall teach you all things.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">160</FONT></A>
 Here again it is so said as if the Son also would not send Him, but the Father only. As therefore in these texts, so also where He says, &#8220;But for them for whom it is prepared by my Father,&#8221; He meant it to be understood that He Himself, with the Father, prepares seats of glory for those for whom He will. But some one may say: There, when He spoke of the Holy Spirit, He so says that He Himself will send Him, as not to deny that the Father will send Him; and in the other place, He so says that the Father will send Him, as not to deny that He will do so Himself; but here He expressly says, &#8220;It is not mine to give,&#8221; and so goes on to say that these things are prepared by the Father. But this is the very thing which we have already laid down to be said according to the form of a servant: <i>viz.</i>, that we are so to understand &#8220;It is not mine to give,&#8221; as if it were said, This is not in the power of man to give; that so He may be understood to give it through that wherein He is God equal to the Father. &#8220;It is not mine,&#8221; He says, &#8220;to give;&#8221; that is, I do not give these things by human power, but &#8220;to those for whom it is prepared by my Father;&#8221; but then take care you understand also, that if &#8220;all things which the Father hath are mine,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">161</FONT></A>
 then this certainly is mine also, and I with the Father have prepared these things.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.i.iii.xii-p31"></A>26. For I ask again, in what manner this is said, &#8220;If any man hear not my words, I will not judge him?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">162</FONT></A>
 For perhaps He has said here, &#8220;I will not judge him,&#8221; in the same sense as there, &#8220;It is not mine to give.&#8221; But what follows here? &#8220;I came not,&#8221; He says, &#8220;to judge the world, but to save the world;&#8221; and then He adds, &#8220;He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him.&#8221; Now here we should understand the Father, unless He had added, &#8220;The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.&#8221; Well, then, will neither the Son judge, because He says, &#8220;I will not judge him,&#8221; nor the Father, but the word which the Son hath spoken? Nay, <A NAME="page_32"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 32</FONT></A> <a name="iv.i.iii.xii-Page_32"></A>but hear what yet follows: &#8220;For I,&#8221; He says, &#8220;have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, He gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak; and I know that His commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.&#8221; If therefore the Son judges not, but &#8220;the word which the Son hath spoken;&#8221; and the word which the Son hath spoken therefore judges, because the Son &#8220;hath not spoken of Himself, but the Father who sent Him gave Him a commandment what He should say, and what He should speak:&#8221; then the Father assuredly judges, whose word it is which the Son hath spoken; and the same Son Himself is the very Word of the Father. For the commandment of the Father is not one thing, and the word of the Father another; for He hath called it both a word and a commandment. Let us see, therefore, whether perchance, when He says, &#8220;I have not spoken of myself,&#8221; He meant to be understood thus,&#8212;I am not born of myself. For if He speaks the word of the Father, then He speaks Himself,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">163</FONT></A>
 because He is Himself the Word of the Father. For ordinarily He says, &#8220;The Father gave to me;&#8221; by which He means it to be understood that the Father begat Him: not that He gave anything to Him, already existing and not possessing it; but that the very meaning of, To have given that He might have, is, To have begotten that He might be. For it is not, as with the creature so with the Son of God before the incarnation and before He took upon Him our flesh, the Only-begotten by whom all things were made; that He <i>is</i> one thing, and has another: but He <i>is</i> in such way as to <i> be</i> what He <i>has</i>. And this is said more plainly, if any one is fit to receive it, in that place where He says: &#8220;For as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">164</FONT></A>
 For He did not give to Him, already existing and not having life, that He should have life in Himself; inasmuch as, in that He <i>is</i>, He is life. Therefore &#8220;He gave to the Son to have life in Himself&#8221; means, He begat the Son to be unchangeable life, which is life eternal. Since, therefore, the Word of God is the Son of God, and the Son of God is &#8220;the true God and eternal life,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">165</FONT></A>
 as John says in his Epistle; so here, what else are we to acknowledge when the Lord says, &#8220;The word which I have spoken, the same shall judge him at the last day,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">166</FONT></A>
 and calls that very word the word of the Father and the commandment of the Father, and that very commandment everlasting life?&#8221; &#8220;And I know,&#8221; He says, &#8220;that His commandment is life everlasting.&#8221;</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.i.iii.xii-p37"></A>27. I ask, therefore, how we are to understand, &#8220;I will not judge him; but the Word which I have spoken shall judge him:&#8221; which appears from what follows to be so said, as if He would say, I will not judge; but the Word of the Father will judge. But the Word of the Father is the Son of God Himself. Is it to be so understood: I will not judge, but I will judge? How can this be true, unless in this way: <i>viz</i>., I will not judge by human power, because I am the Son of man; but I will judge by the power of the Word, because I am the Son of God? Or if it still seems contradictory and inconsistent to say, I will not judge, but I will judge; what shall we say of that place where He says, &#8220;My doctrine is not mine?&#8221; How &#8220;mine,&#8221; when &#8220;not mine?&#8221; For He did not say, <i>This</i> doctrine is not mine, but &#8220;<i>My</i> doctrine is not mine:&#8221; that which He called His own, the same He called not His own. How can this be true, unless He has called it His own in one relation; not His own, in another? According to the form of God, His own; according to the form of a servant, not His own. For when He says, &#8220;It is not mine, but His that sent me,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">167</FONT></A>
 He makes us recur to the Word itself. For the doctrine of the Father is the Word of the Father, which is the Only Son. And what, too, does that mean, &#8220;He that believeth on me, believeth not on me?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">168</FONT></A>
 How believe on Him, yet not believe on Him? How can so opposite and inconsistent a thing be understood&#8212;&#8220;Whoso believeth on me,&#8221; He says, &#8220;believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me;&#8221;&#8212;unless you so understand it, Whoso believeth on me believeth not on that which he sees, lest our hope should be in the creature; but on Him who took the creature, whereby He might appear to human eyes, and so might cleanse our hearts by faith, to contemplate Himself as equal to the Father? So that in turning the attention of believers to the Father, and saying, &#8220;Believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me,&#8221; He certainly did not mean Himself to be separated from the Father, that is, from Him that sent Him; but that men might so believe on Himself, as they believe on the Father, to whom He is equal. And this He says in express terms in another place, &#8220;Ye believe in God, believe also in me:&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_168"></A><A HREF="#fn_168"><FONT SIZE="1">169</FONT></A>
 that is, in the same way as you believe in God, so also believe in me; because I and the Father are One God. As therefore, here, He has as it were withdrawn <A NAME="page_33"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 33</FONT></A> <a name="iv.i.iii.xii-Page_33"></A>the faith of men from Himself, and transferred it to the Father, by saying, &#8220;Believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me,&#8221; from whom nevertheless He certainly did not separate Himself; so also, when He says, &#8220;It is not mine to give, but [it shall be given to them] for whom it is prepared by my Father,&#8221; it is I think plain in what relation both are to be taken. For that other also is of the same kind, &#8220;I will not judge;&#8221; whereas He Himself shall judge the quick and dead.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_169"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">170</FONT></A>
 But because He will not do so by human power, therefore, reverting to the Godhead, He raises the hearts of men upwards; which to lift up, He Himself came down.</p>
