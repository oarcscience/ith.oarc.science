id="iv.ii.lxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 74.—God Does Not Pardon the Sins of
Those Who Do Not from the Heart Forgive Others.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxxvi-p2"></span>Now, he who asks forgiveness of the man
against whom he has sinned, being moved by his sin to ask forgiveness,
cannot be counted an enemy in such a sense that it should be as
difficult to love him now as it was when he was engaged in active
hostility. And the man who does not from his heart forgive him who
repents of his sin, and asks forgiveness, need not suppose that his own
sins are forgiven of God. For the Truth cannot lie. And what reader or
hearer of the Gospel can have failed to notice, that the same person who
said, “I am the Truth,” <span id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234)
taught us also this form of prayer; and in order to impress this
particular petition deeply upon our minds, said, “For if ye forgive men
their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if ye
forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your
trespasses”? <span id="fr_1235"></span>[1236](#fn_1235) The man whom the
thunder of this warning does not awaken is not asleep, but dead; and yet
so powerful is that voice, that it can awaken even the dead.
