<span id="iv.i.iv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—The Glorification of the Son by
the Father Does Not Prove Inequality.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.v-p2"></span>6. But here also let them wake up if they
can, who have thought this, too, to be a testimony on their side, to
show that the Father <span id="page_40">p. 40</span> <span
id="iv.i.iv.v-Page_40"></span>is greater than the Son, because the Son
hath said, “Father, glorify me.” Why, the Holy Spirit also glorifies
Him. Pray, is the Spirit, too, greater than He? Moreover, if on that
account the Holy Spirit glorifies the Son, because He shall receive of
that which is the Son’s, and shall therefore receive of that which is
the Son’s because all things that the Father has are the Son’s also; it
is evident that when the Holy Spirit glorifies the Son, the Father
glorifies the Son. Whence it may be perceived that all things that the
Father hath are not only of the Son, but also of the Holy Spirit,
because the Holy Spirit is able to glorify the Son, whom the Father
glorifies. But if he who glorifies is greater than he whom he glorifies,
let them allow that those are equal who mutually glorify each other. But
it is written, also, that the Son glorifies the Father; for He says, “I
have glorified Thee on the earth.” <span
id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223) Truly let them beware lest the Holy
Spirit be thought greater than both, because He glorifies the Son whom
the Father glorifies, while it is not written that He Himself is
glorified either by the Father or by the Son.
