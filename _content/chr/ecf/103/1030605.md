<span id="v.iii.lii-p1"></span> 51. But I contend not with those, who
assert that a man can in this life live without any sin: I contend not,
I gainsay not. For perhaps we take measure of the great from out our own
misery, and, comparing ourselves with ourselves, understand not. <span
id="fr_2207"></span>[2208](#fn_2207) One thing I know, that those great
ones, such as we are not, such as we have not as yet made proof of, by
how much they are great, by so much humble themselves in all things,
that they may find grace before God. For, let them be how great soever
they will, “there is no servant greater than his Lord, nor disciple
greater than his master.” <span id="fr_2208"></span>[2209](#fn_2208) And
assuredly He is the Lord, Who saith, “All things have been delivered
unto Me of My Father;” <span id="fr_2209"></span>[2210](#fn_2209) and He
is the Master, Who saith, “Come unto Me, all ye who labor, and learn of
Me;” and yet what learn we? “In that I am meek,” saith He, “and lowly of
heart.”
