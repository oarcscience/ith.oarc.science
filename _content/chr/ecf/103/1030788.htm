<p class="c10"><a name="v.viii.xiv-p1"></A>  13. But they answer and speak, saying, &#8220;If the will of man without any aid of God by strength of free choice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2659"></A><A HREF="#fn_2659"><FONT SIZE="1">2660</FONT></A>
 bears so many grievous and horrible distresses, whether in mind or body, that it may enjoy the delight of this mortal life and of sins, why may it not be that in the same manner the self-same will of man by the same strength of free-choice, not thereunto looking to be aided of God, but unto itself by natural possibility sufficing, doth, in all of labor or sorrow that is put upon it, for righteousness and eternal life&#146;s sake most patiently sustain the same? Or is it so, say they, that the will of the unjust is sufficient, without aid of God, for them, yea even to exercise themselves in undergoing torture for iniquity, and before they be tortured by others; sufficient the will of them which love the respiting of this life that, without aid of God, they should in the midst of <A NAME="page_532"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 532</FONT></A> <a name="v.viii.xiv-Page_532"></A>most atrocious and protracted torments persevere in a lie, lest confessing their misdeeds they be ordered to be put to death; and not sufficient the will of the just, unless strength be put into them from above, that whatever be their pains, they should, either for beauty&#146;s sake of very righteousness or for love of eternal life, bear the same?&#8221;</p>
