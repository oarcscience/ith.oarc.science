<span id="iv.i.vi.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—How We are Rendered Apt for the
Perception of Truth Through the Incarnate Word.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vi.iii-p2"></span>4. But “the light shineth in darkness,
and the darkness comprehended it not.” Now the “darkness” is the foolish
minds of men, made blind by vicious desires and unbelief. And that the
Word, by whom all things were made, might care for these and heal them,
“The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.” For our enlightening is
the partaking of the Word, namely, of that life which is the light of
men. But for this partaking we were utterly unfit, and fell short of it,
on account of the uncleanness of sins. Therefore we were to be cleansed.
And further, the one cleansing of the unrighteous and of the proud is
the blood of the Righteous One, and the humbling of God Himself; <span
id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447) that we might be cleansed through Him,
made as He was what we are by nature, and what we are not by sin, that
we might contemplate God, which by nature we are not. For by nature we
are not God: by nature we are men, by sin we are not righteous.
Wherefore God, made a righteous man, interceded with God for man the
sinner. For the sinner is not congruous to the righteous, but man is
congruous to man. By joining therefore to us the likeness of His
humanity, He took away the unlikeness of our unrighteousness; and by
being made partaker of our mortality, He made us partakers of His
divinity. For the death of the sinner springing from the necessity of
comdemnation is deservedly abolished by the death of the Righteous One
springing from the free choice of His compassion, while His single
\[death and resurrection\] answers to our double \[death and
resurrection\]. <span id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448) For this
congruity, or suitableness, or concord, or consonance, or whatever more
appropriate word there may be, whereby one is \[united\] to two, is of
great weight in all compacting, or better, perhaps, co-adaptation, of
the creature. For (as it just occurs to me) what I mean is precisely
that co-adaptation which the Greeks call <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.vi.iii-p4.1"></span>ἁρμονία</span>. However this is not the
place to set forth the power of that consonance of single to double
which is found especially in us, and which is naturally so implanted in
us (and by whom, except by Him who created us?), that not even the
ignorant can fail to perceive it, whether when singing themselves or
hearing others. For by this it is that treble and bass voices are in
harmony, so that any one who in his note departs from it, offends
extremely, not only trained skill, of which the most part of men are
devoid, but the very sense of hearing. To demonstrate this, needs no
doubt a long discourse; but any one who knows it, may make it plain to
the very ear in a rightly ordered monochord.
