id="iv.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—God is to Be Worshipped Through
Faith, Hope, and Love.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.v-p2"></span>Now if I should answer, that God is to be
worshipped with faith, hope, and love, you will at once say that this
answer is too brief, and will ask me briefly to unfold the objects of
each of these three graces, *viz.*, what we are to believe, what we are
to hope for, and what we are to love. And when I have done this, you
will have an answer to all the questions you asked in your letter. If
you have kept a copy of your letter, you can easily turn it up and read
it over again: if you have not, you will have no difficulty in recalling
it when I refresh your memory.
