<span id="v.viii.xxvii-p1"></span> 26. Cry we therefore with the spirit
of charity, and until we come to the inheritance in which we are alway
to remain, let us be, through love which becometh the free-born, not
through fear which becometh bondmen, patient of suffering. Cry we, so
long as we are poor, until we be with that inheritance made rich. Seeing
how great earnest thereof we have received, in that Christ to make us
rich made Himself poor; Who being exalted unto the riches which are
above, there was sent One Who should breathe into our hearts holy
longings, the Holy Spirit. Of these poor, as yet believing, not yet
beholding; as yet hoping, not yet enjoying; as yet sighing in desire,
not yet reigning in felicity; as yet hungering <span id="page_536">p.

yet satisfied: of these poor, then, “the patience shall not perish for
ever:” <span id="fr_2705"></span>[2706](#fn_2705) not that there will be
patience there also, where aught to endure shall not be; but “will not
perish,” meaning that it will not be unfruitful. But its fruit it will
have for ever, therefore it “shall not perish for ever.” For he who
labors in vain, when his hope fails for which he labored, says with good
cause, “I have lost so much labor:” but he who comes to the promise of
his labor says, congratulating himself, I have not lost my labor. Labor
then is said not to perish (or be lost), not because it lasts
perpetually, but because it is not spent in vain. So also the patience
of the poor of Christ (who yet are to be made rich as heirs of Christ)
shall not perish for ever: not because there also we shall be commanded
patiently to bear, but because for that which we have here patiently
borne, we shall enjoy eternal bliss. He will put no end to everlasting
felicity, Who giveth temporal patience unto the will: because both the
one and the other is of Him bestowed as a gift upon charity, Whose gift
that charity is also.
