<span id="iv.ii.lxxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lxxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 81.—There are Two Causes of Sin,
Ignorance and Weakness; And We Need Divine Help to Overcome Both.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxxxiii-p2"></span>I shall now say this, which I have
often said before in other places of my works. There are two causes that
lead to sin: either we do not yet know our duty, or we do not perform
the duty that we know. The former is the sin of ignorance, the latter of
weakness. Now against these it is our duty to struggle; but we shall
certainly be beaten in the fight, unless we are helped by God, not only
to see our duty, but also, when we clearly see it, to make the love of
righteousness stronger in us than the love of earthly things, the eager
longing after which, or the fear of losing which, leads us with our eyes
open into known sin. In the latter case we are not only sinners, for we
are so even when we err through ignorance, but we are also transgressors
of the law; for we leave undone what we know we ought to do, and we do
what we know we ought not to do. Wherefore not only ought we to pray for
pardon when we have sinned, saying, “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive
our debtors;” but we ought to pray for guidance, that we may be kept
from sinning, saying, “and lead us not into temptation.” And we are to
pray to Him of whom the Psalmist says, “The Lord is my light and my
salvation:” <span id="fr_1262"></span>[1263](#fn_1262) my light, for He
removes my ignorance; my salvation, for He takes away my infirmity.
