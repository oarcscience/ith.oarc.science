it were too long to treat thoroughly of all that in that “Pound” <span
id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457) of Dictinius are set down as
precedents of lying, meet to be imitated, it seemeth to me that this is
the rule to which not only these, but whatever such there be, must be
reduced. Namely, either what is believed to be a lie must be shown not
to be such; whether it be where a truth is left untold, and yet no
falsehood told; or where a true signification willeth one thing to be
understood of another, which kind of figurative either sayings or doings
abounds in the prophetical writings. Or, those which are convicted to be
lies, must be proved to be not meet to be imitated: and if any (as other
sins) should stealthily creep in upon us, we are not to attribute
righteousness to them, but to ask pardon for them. So indeed it seems to
me, and to this sentence the things above disputed do compel me.
