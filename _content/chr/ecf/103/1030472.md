<span id="iv.vii.viii"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.viii-p1"></span> 8. He was begotten before all times,
before all worlds. “Begotten before.” Before what, He in Whom is no
before? Do not in the least imagine any time before that Nativity of
Christ whereby He was begotten of the Father; of that Nativity I am
speaking by which He is Son of God Almighty, His Only Son our Lord; of
that am I first speaking. Do not imagine in this Nativity a beginning of
time; do not imagine any space of eternity in which the Father was and
the Son was not. Since when the Father was, since then the Son. And what
is that “since,” where is no beginning? Therefore ever Father without
beginning, ever Son without beginning. And how, thou wilt say, was He
begotten, if He have no beginning? Of eternal, coeternal. At no time was
the Father, and the Son not, and yet Son of Father was begotten. Whence
is any manner of similitude to be had? We are among things of earth, we
are in the visible creature. Let the earth give me a similitude: it
gives none. Let the element of the waters give me some similitude: it
hath not whereof to give. Some animal give me a similitude: neither can
this do it. An animal indeed engenders, both what engenders and what is
engendered: but first is the father, and then is born the son. Let us
find the coeval and imagine it coeternal. If we shall be able to find a
father coeval with his son, and son coeval with his father, let us
believe God the Father coeval with His Son, and God the Son coeternal
with His Father. On earth we can find some coeval, we cannot find any
coeternal. Let us stretch <span id="fr_1773"></span>[1774](#fn_1773) the
coeval and imagine it coeternal. Some one, it may be, will put you on
the stretch, <span id="fr_1774"></span>[1775](#fn_1774) by saying, “When
is it possible for a father to be found coeval with his son, or son
coeval with his father? That the father may beget he goes before in age;
that the son may be begotten, he comes after in age: but this father
coeval with son, or son with father, how can it be?” Imagine to
yourselves fire as father, its shining as son; see, we have found the
coevals. From the instant that the fire begins to be, that instant it
begets the shining: neither fire before shining, nor shining after fire.
And if we ask, which begets which? the fire the shining, or the shining
the fire? Immediately ye conceive by natural sense, by the innate wit of
your minds ye all cry out, The fire the shining, not the shining the
fire. Lo, here you have a father beginning; lo, a son at the same time,
neither going before nor coming after. Lo, here then is a father
beginning, lo, a son at the same time beginning. If I have shown you a
father beginning, and a son at the same time beginning, believe the
Father not beginning, and with Him the Son not beginning either; the one
eternal, the other coeternal. If ye get on with your learning, ye
understand: take <span id="page_372">p. 372</span> <span
id="iv.vii.viii-Page_372"></span>pains to get on. The being born, ye
have; but also the growing, ye ought to have; because no man begins with
being perfect. As for the Son of God, indeed, He could be born perfect,
because He was begotten without time, coeternal with the Father, long
before all things, not in age, but in eternity. He then was begotten
coeternal, of which generation the Prophet said, “His generation who
shall declare?” <span id="fr_1775"></span>[1776](#fn_1775) begotten of
the Father without time, He was born of the Virgin in the fullness of
times. This nativity had times going before it. In opportunity of time,
when He would, when He knew, then was He born: for He was not born
without His will. None of us is born because he will, and none of us
dies when he will: He, when He would, was born; when He would, He died:
how He would, He was born of a Virgin: how He would, He died; on the
cross. Whatever He would, He did: because He was in such wise Man that,
unseen, <span id="fr_1776"></span>[1777](#fn_1776) He was God; God
assuming, Man assumed; <span id="fr_1777"></span>[1778](#fn_1777) One
Christ, God and Man.
