<span id="iv.vii.xiii-p1"></span> 13. It follows in the Creed, “And in
the Holy Ghost.” This Trinity, one God, one nature, one substance, one
power; highest equality, no division, no diversity, perpetual dearness
of love. <span id="fr_1794"></span>[1795](#fn_1794) Would ye know the
Holy Ghost, that He is God? Be baptized, and ye will be His temple. The
Apostle says, “Know ye not that your bodies are the temple within you of
the Holy Ghost, Whom ye have of God?” <span
id="fr_1795"></span>[1796](#fn_1795) A temple is for God: thus also
Solomon, king and prophet, was bidden to build a temple for God. If he
had built a temple for the sun or moon or some star or some angel, would
not God condemn him? Because therefore he built a temple for God he
showed that he worshipped God. And of what did he build? Of wood and
stone, because God deigned to make unto Himself by His servant an house
on earth, where He might be asked, where He might be had in mind. Of
which blessed Stephen says, “Solomon built Him an house; howbeit the
Most High dwelleth not in temples made by hand.” <span
id="fr_1796"></span>[1797](#fn_1796) If then our bodies are the temple
of the Holy Ghost, what manner of God is it that built a temple for the
Holy Ghost? But it was God. For if our bodies be a temple of the Holy
Ghost, the same built this temple for the Holy Ghost, that built our
bodies. Listen to the Apostle saying, “God hath tempered the body,
giving unto that which lacked the greater honor;” <span
id="fr_1797"></span>[1798](#fn_1797) when he was speaking of the
different members that there should be no schisms in the body. God
created our body. The grass, God created; our body Who created? How do
we prove that the grass is God’s creating? He that clothes, the same
creates. Read the Gospel, “If then the grass of the fields,” saith it,
“which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, God so
clotheth.” <span id="fr_1798"></span>[1799](#fn_1798) He, then, creates
Who clothes. And the Apostle: “Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not
quickened except it die; and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not
that body that shall be, but a bare grain, as perchance of wheat, or of
some other corn; but God giveth it a body as He would, and to each one
of seeds its proper body.” <span id="fr_1799"></span>[1800](#fn_1799) If
then it be God that builds our bodies, God that builds our members, and
our bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost, doubt not that the Holy
Ghost is God. And do not add as it were a third God; because Father and
Son and Holy Ghost is One God. So believe ye.
