<span id="v.iii.xiv-p1"></span> 13. Whence they are marvellously void of
wisdom, who think that the good of this continence is not necessary for
the sake of the kingdom of heaven, but for the sake of the present
world: in that, forsooth, married persons are strained different ways by
earthly cares more and more straitened, from which trouble virgins and
continent persons are free: as though on this account only it were
better not to be married, that the straits of this present time may be
escaped, not that it is of any profit unto a future life. And, that they
may not seem to have put forth this vain opinion from out the vanity of
their own heart, they take the Apostle to witness, where he saith, “But
concerning virgins I have not command of the Lord, but I give counsel,
as having obtained mercy from God to be faithful. Therefore I think that
this is good on account of the present necessity, because it is good for
a man so to be.” <span id="fr_2044"></span>[2045](#fn_2044) Lo, say
<span id="page_421">p. 421</span> <span
id="v.iii.xiv-Page_421"></span>they, where the Apostle shows “that this
is good on account of the present necessity,” not on account of the
future eternity. As though the Apostle would have regard for the present
necessity, otherwise than as providing and consulting for the future;
whereas all his dealing <span id="fr_2045"></span>[2046](#fn_2045) calls
not save unto life eternal.
