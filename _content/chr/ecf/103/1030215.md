<span id="iv.i.xvi.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—How the Image of God is Formed
Anew in Man.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvi.xvi-p2"></span>22. But those who, by being reminded,
are turned to the Lord from that deformity whereby they were through
worldly lusts conformed to this world, are formed anew from the world,
when they hearken to the apostle, saying, “Be not conformed to this
world, but be ye formed again in the renewing of your mind;” <span
id="fr_905"></span>[906](#fn_905) that that image may begin to be formed
again by Him by whom it had been formed at first. For that image cannot
form itself again, as it could deform itself. He says again elsewhere:
“Be ye renewed in the spirit of your mind; and put ye on the new man,
which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.” <span
id="fr_906"></span>[907](#fn_906) That which is meant by “created after
God,” is expressed in another place by “after the image of God.” <span
id="fr_907"></span>[908](#fn_907) But it lost righteousness and true
holiness by sinning, through which that image became defaced and
tarnished; and this it recovers when it is formed again and renewed. But
when he says, “In the spirit of your mind,” he does not intend to be
understood of two things, as though mind were one, and the spirit of the
mind another; but he speaks thus, because all mind is spirit, but all
spirit is not mind. For there is a Spirit also that is God, <span
id="fr_908"></span>[909](#fn_908) which cannot be renewed, because it
cannot grow old. And we speak also of a spirit in man distinct from the
mind, to which spirit belong the images that are formed after the
likeness of bodies; and of this the apostle speaks to the Corinthians,
where he says, “But if I shall have prayed with a tongue, my spirit
prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.” <span
id="fr_909"></span>[910](#fn_909) For he speaks thus, when that which is
said is not understood; since it cannot even be said, unless the images
of the corporeal articulate sounds anticipate the oral sound by the
thought of the spirit. The soul of man is also called spirit, whence are
the words in the Gospel, “And He bowed His head, and gave up His
spirit;” <span id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910) by which the death of
the body, through the spirit’s leaving it, is signified. We speak also
of the spirit of a beast, as it is expressly written in the book of
Solomon called Ecclesiastes; “Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth
upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the
earth?” <span id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911) It is written too in
Genesis, where it is said that by the deluge all flesh died which “had
in it the spirit of life.” <span id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912) We
speak also of the spirit, meaning the wind, a thing most manifestly
corporeal; whence is that in the Psalms, “Fire and hail, snow and ice,
the spirit of the storm.” <span id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913) Since
spirit, then, is a word of so many meanings, the apostle intended to
express by “the spirit of the mind” that spirit which is called the
mind. As the same apostle also, when he says, “In putting off the body
of the flesh,” <span id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914) certainly did not
intend two things, as though flesh were one, and the body of the flesh
another; but because body is the name of many things that have no flesh
(for besides the flesh, there are many bodies celestial and bodies
terrestrial), he expressed by the body of the flesh that body which is
flesh. In like manner, therefore, by the spirit of the mind, that spirit
which is mind. Elsewhere, too, he has even more plainly called it an
image, while enforcing the same thing in other words. “Do you,” he says,
“putting off the old man with his deeds, put on the new man, which is
renewed in the knowledge of God after the image of Him that created
him.” <span id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915) Where the one passage
reads, “Put ye on the new man, which is created after God,” the other
has, “Put ye on the new man, which is renewed after the image of Him
that created him.”

<span id="iv.i.xvi.xvi-p14"></span>In the one place he says, “After
God;” in the other, “After the image of Him that created him.” But
instead of saying, as in the former passages “In righteousness and true
holiness,” he has put in the latter, “In the knowledge of God.” This
renewal, then, and forming again of the mind, is wrought either after
God, or after the image of God. But it is said to be after God, in order
that it may not be supposed to be after another creature; and to be
after the image of God, in order that this renewing may be understood to
take place in that wherein is the image of God, *i.e.* in the mind. Just
as we say, that he who has departed from the body a faithful and
righteous man, is dead after the body, not after the spirit. For what do
we mean by dead after the body, unless as to <span id="page_196">p.
196</span> <span id="iv.i.xvi.xvi-Page_196"></span>the body or in the
body, and not dead as to the soul or in the soul? Or if we want to say
he is handsome after the body, or strong after the body, not after the
mind; what else is this, than that he is handsome or strong in body, not
in mind? And the same is the case with numberless other instances. Let
us not therefore so understand the words, “After the image of Him that
created him,” as though it were a different image after which he is
renewed, and not the very same which is itself renewed.
