<span id="v.vi.xxxiii-p1"></span> 32. But, as for that which is written,
that God did good to the Hebrew midwives, and to Rahab the harlot of
Jericho, <span id="fr_2443"></span>[2444](#fn_2443) this was not because
they lied, but because they were merciful to God’s people. That
therefore which was rewarded in them was, not their deceit, but their
benevolence; benignity of mind, not iniquity of lying. <span
id="fr_2444"></span>[2445](#fn_2444) For, as it would not be marvellous
and absurd if God on ac<span id="page_496">p. 496</span> <span
id="v.vi.xxxiii-Page_496"></span>count of good works after done by them
should be willing to forgive some evil works at another time before
committed, so it is not to be marvelled at that God beholding at one
time, in one cause, both these, that is, the thing done of mercy and the
thing done of deceit, did both reward the good, and for the sake of this
good forgive that evil. For if sins which are done of carnal
concupiscence, not of mercy, are for the sake of after works of mercy
remitted, <span id="fr_2445"></span>[2446](#fn_2445) why are not those
through merit of mercy remitted which of mercy itself are committed? For
more grievous is a sin which with purpose of hurting, than that which
with purpose of helping, is wrought. And consequently if that is blotted
out by a work of mercy thereafter following, why is this, which is less
heinous, not blotted out by the mercy itself of the man, both going
before that he may sin, and going along with him while he sins? So
indeed it may seem: but in truth it is one thing to say, “I ought not to
have sinned, but I will do works of mercy whereby I may blot out the sin
which I did before;” and another to say, “I ought to sin, because I
cannot else show mercy.” It is, I say, one thing to say, “Because we
have already sinned, let us do good,” and another to say, “Let us sin,
that we may do good.” There it is said, “Let us do good, because we have
done evil;” but here, “Let us do evil that good may come.” <span
id="fr_2446"></span>[2447](#fn_2446) And, consequently, there we have to
drain off the sink of sin, here to beware of a doctrine which teacheth
to sin.
