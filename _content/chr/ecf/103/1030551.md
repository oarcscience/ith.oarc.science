<span id="v.ii.xxxv-p1"></span> 34. But those of ours who have wives we
advise, with all our power, that they dare not to judge of those holy
fathers after their own weakness, comparing, as the Apostle says,
themselves with themselves; <span id="fr_2021"></span>[2022](#fn_2021)
and therefore, not understanding how great strength the soul hath, doing
service unto righteousness against lusts, that it acquiesce not in
carnal motions of this sort, or suffer them to glide on or advance unto
sexual intercourse beyond the necessity of begetting children, so far as
the order of nature, so far as the use of custom, so far as the decrees
of laws prescribe. Forsooth it is on this account that men have this
suspicion concerning those fathers, in that they themselves have either
chosen marriage through incontinence, or use their wives with
intemperance. But however let such as are continent, either men, who, on
the death of their wives, or, women, who, on the death of their
husbands, or both, who, with mutual consent, have vowed continence unto
God, know that to them indeed there is due a greater recompense than
marriage chastity demands; but, (as regards) the marriages of the holy
Fathers, who were joined after the manner of prophecy, who neither in
sexual intercourse sought aught save children, nor in children
themselves aught save what should set forward Christ coming hereafter in
the flesh, not only let them not despise them in comparison of their own
purpose, but let them without any doubting prefer them even to their own
purpose.
