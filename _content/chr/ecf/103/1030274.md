<span id="iv.ii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—The Secondary Causes of Evil are
Ignorance and Lust.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxvi-p2"></span>This is the first evil that befell the
intelli<span id="page_246">p. 246</span> <span
id="iv.ii.xxvi-Page_246"></span>gent creation—that is, its first
privation of good. Following upon this crept in, and now even in
opposition to man’s will, *ignorance* of duty, and *lust* after what is
hurtful: and these brought in their train *error* and *suffering*,
which, when they are felt to be imminent, produce that shrinking of the
mind which is called *fear*. Further, when the mind attains the objects
of its desire, however hurtful or empty they may be, error prevents it
from perceiving their true nature, or its perceptions are overborne by a
diseased appetite, and so it is puffed up with a *foolish joy*. From
these fountains of evil, which spring out of defect rather than
superfluity, flows every form of misery that besets a rational nature.
