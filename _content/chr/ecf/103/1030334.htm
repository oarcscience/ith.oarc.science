<p class="c10"><a name="iv.ii.lxxxvi-p2"></A>Now, as to the resurrection of the body, &#8212;not a resurrection such as some have had, who came back to life for a time and died again, but a resurrection to eternal life, as the body of Christ Himself rose again,&#8212;I do not see how I can discuss the matter briefly, and at the same time give a satisfactory answer to all the questions that are ordinarily raised about it. Yet that the bodies of all men&#8212;both those who have been born and those who shall be born, both those who have died and those who shall die&#8212;shall be raised again, no Christian ought to have the shadow of a doubt.</p>
