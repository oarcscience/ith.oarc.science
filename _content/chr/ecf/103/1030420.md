<span id="iv.v.vi-p1"></span> 6. If this Queen ye see not, now rich also
with royal progeny. If she see not that fulfilled which she heard to
have been promised, she, unto whom it was said, “Hear, O daughter, and
see.” If she hath not left the ancient rites of the world, she, unto
whom it was said, “Forget thy own people and thy Father’s house.” If she
confesses not every where Christ the Lord, she, unto whom it was said,
“The King hath desired thy beauty, for He is the Lord thy God.” If she
sees not the cities of the nations pour forth prayers and offer gifts
unto Christ, concerning Whom it was said unto her, “There shall worship
Him the daughters of Tyre with gifts.” If the pride also of the rich is
not laid aside, and they do not entreat help of the Church, unto whom it
was said, “Thy face shall all the rich of the people entreat.” If He
acknowledges not the King’s daughter, unto Whom she was bidden to say,
“Our Father Who art in Heaven;” <span
id="fr_1663"></span>[1664](#fn_1663) and in her saints in the inner man
she is not renewed from day to day, concerning whom it was said, “All
the glory of that King’s daughter is within:” although she strike upon
the eyes of them also that are without with the blaze <span
id="fr_1664"></span>[1665](#fn_1664) of the fame of her preachers, in
diversity of tongues, as “in fringes of gold, and raiment of divers
colors.” If there be not, now that His fame is spread abroad in every
place by His good odor, <span id="fr_1665"></span>[1666](#fn_1665)
virgins also brought unto Christ to be consecrated, of Whom it is said,
and to Whom it is said, “There shall be brought unto the King the
virgins after her, her companions shall be brought unto Thee.” And that
they might not seem to be brought like captives, into some, as it were,
prison, he says, “They shall be brought in joy and gladness, they shall
be brought into the King’s temple.” If she brings not forth sons, that
of them she may have, as it were, fathers, whom she may appoint unto
herself every where as rulers, she, unto whom it is said, “Instead of
thy fathers there are born unto thee sons, thou shall set them as
princes over the whole earth:” unto whose prayers their mother both
preferred and made subject, commends herself, “They shall be mindful of
thy name, even from generation to generation.” If, by reason of the
preaching of those same fathers, wherein they have without ceasing made
mention of her name, there are not so great multitudes in her gathered
together, and without end in their own tongues unto her confess the
praise of grace, unto whom it is said, “Therefore shall the people
confess unto thee for ever, and for ever and ever.” If these things are
not so shown to be clear, as that the eyes of enemies find not in what
direction to turn aside, where the same clearness strikes them not, so
as by it to be obliged to confess what is evident: you perhaps assert
with reason, that no proofs are shown to you, by seeing which you may
believe those things also which you see not. But if those things, which
you see, both have been foretold long before, and are so clearly
fulfilled; if the truth itself makes itself clear to you, by
effects <span id="fr_1666"></span>[1667](#fn_1666) going before and
following after, O remnant of unbelief, that ye may believe the things
which you see not, blush at those things which ye see.
