<span id="v.vii.iv-p1"></span> 3. Nor do they attend to this, that if
another should say, that the Lord indeed, speaking in parables and in
similitudes concerning spiritual food and clothing, did warn that not on
these accounts should His servants be solicitous; (as He saith, “When
they shall drag you to judgment-seats, take no thought what ye shall
speak. For it will be given you in that hour what ye shall speak: but it
is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in
you.” <span id="fr_2478"></span>[2479](#fn_2478) For the discourse of
spiritual wisdom is that for which He would not that they should take
thought, promising that it should be given unto them, nothing solicitous
thereof;) but the Apostle now, in manner Apostolical, more openly
discoursing and more properly, than figuratively speaking, as is the
case with much, indeed well-nigh all, in his Apostolic Epistles, said it
properly of corporal work and food, “If any will not work, neither let
him eat:” by those would their sentence be rendered doubtful, unless,
considering the other words of the Lord, they should find somewhat
whereby they might prove it to have been of not caring for corporal food
and raiment that He spoke when He said, “Be not solicitous what ye shall
eat, or what ye shall drink, or wherewithal ye shall be clothed.” As, if
they should observe what He saith, “For all these things do the Gentiles
seek;” for there He shows that it was of very corporal and temporal
things that He spake. So then, were this the only thing that the Apostle
has said on this subject, “If any will not work, neither let him eat;”
these words might be drawn over to another mean<span id="page_505">p.
505</span> <span id="v.vii.iv-Page_505"></span>ing: but since in many
other places of his Epistles, what is his mind on this point, he most
openly teaches, they superfluously essay to raise a mist before
themselves and others, that what that charity adviseth they may not only
refuse to do, but even to understand it themselves, or let it be
understood by others; not fearing that which is written, “He would not
understand that he might do good.” <span
