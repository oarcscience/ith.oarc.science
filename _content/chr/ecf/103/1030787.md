<span id="v.viii.xiii-p1"></span> 12. But concerning true patience,
worthy of the name of this virtue, whence it is to be had, must now be
inquired. For there are some <span id="fr_2649"></span>[2650](#fn_2649)
who attribute it to the strength of the human will, not which it hath by
Divine assistance, but which it hath of free-will. Now this error is a
proud one: for it is the error of them which abound, of whom it is said
in the Psalm, “A scornful reproof to them which abound, and a despising
to the proud.” <span id="fr_2650"></span>[2651](#fn_2650) It is not
therefore that “patience of the poor” which “perisheth not
forever.” <span id="fr_2651"></span>[2652](#fn_2651) For these poor
receive it from that Rich One, to Whom is said, “My God art Thou,
because my goods Thou needest not:” <span
id="fr_2652"></span>[2653](#fn_2652) of Whom is “every good gift, and
every perfect gift;” <span id="fr_2653"></span>[2654](#fn_2653) to Whom
crieth the needy and the poor, and in asking, seeking, knocking, saith,
“My God, deliver me from the hand of the sinner, and from the hand of
the lawless and unjust: because Thou art my patience, O Lord, my hope
from my youth up.” <span id="fr_2654"></span>[2655](#fn_2654) But these
which abound, and disdain to be in want before God, lest they receive of
Him true patience, they which glory in their own false patience, seek to
“confound the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his hope.” <span
id="fr_2655"></span>[2656](#fn_2655) Nor do they regard, seeing they are
men, and attribute so much to their own, that is, to the human will,
that they run into that which is written, “Cursed is every one who
putteth his hope in man.” <span id="fr_2656"></span>[2657](#fn_2656)
Whence even if it chance them that they do bear up under any hardships
or difficulties, either that they may not displease men, or that they
may not suffer worse, or in self-pleasing and love of their own
presumption, do with most proud will bear up under these same, it is
meet that concerning patience this be said unto them, which concerning
wisdom the blessed Apostle James saith, “This wisdom cometh not from
above, but is earthly, animal, devilish.” <span
id="fr_2657"></span>[2658](#fn_2657) For why may there not be a false
patience of the proud, as there is a false wisdom of the proud? But from
Whom cometh true wisdom, from Him cometh also true patience. For to Him
singeth that poor in spirit, “Unto God is my soul subjected, because
from Him is my patience.” <span id="fr_2658"></span>[2659](#fn_2658)
