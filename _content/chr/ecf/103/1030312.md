id="iv.ii.lxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 62.—By the Sacrifice of Christ All
Things are Restored, and Peace is Made Between Earth and Heaven.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxiv-p2"></span>And, of course, the holy angels, taught
by God, in the eternal contemplation of whose truth their happiness
consists, know how great a number of the human race are to supplement
their ranks, and fill up the full tale of their citizenship. Wherefore
the apostle says, that “all things are gathered together in one in
Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth.” <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[1204](#fn_1203) The things which are in heaven are
gathered together when what was lost therefrom in the fall of the angels
is restored from among men; and the things which are on earth are
gathered together, when those who are predestined to eternal life are
redeemed from their old corruption. And thus, through that single
sacrifice in which the Mediator was offered up, the one sacrifice of
which the many victims under the law were types, heavenly things are
brought into peace with earthly things, and earthly things with
heavenly. Wherefore, as the same apostle says: “For it pleased the
Father that in Him should all fullness dwell: and, having made peace
through the blood of His cross, by Him to reconcile all things to
Himself: by Him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in
heaven.” <span id="fr_1204"></span>[1205](#fn_1204)
