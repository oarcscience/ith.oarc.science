id="iv.ii.cviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 106.—The Grace of God Was Necessary
to Man’s Salvation Before the Fall as Well as After It.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.cviii-p2"></span>The former immortality man lost through
the exercise of his free-will; the latter he shall obtain through grace,
whereas, if he had not sinned, he should have obtained it by desert.
Even in that case, however, there could have been no merit without
grace; because, although the mere exercise of man’s free-will was
sufficient to bring in sin, his free-will would not have sufficed for
his maintenance in righteousness, unless God had assisted it by
imparting a portion of His unchangeable goodness. Just as it is in man’s
power to die whenever he will (for, not to speak of other means, any one
can put an end to himself by simple abstinence from food), but the mere
will cannot preserve life in the absence of food and the other means of
life; so man in paradise was able of his mere will, simply by abandoning
righteousness, to destroy himself; but to have maintained a life of
righteousness would have been too much for his will, unless it had been
sustained by the Creator’s power. After the fall, however, a more
abundant exercise of God’s mercy was required, because the will itself
had to be freed from the bondage in which it was held by sin and death.
And the will owes its freedom in no degree to itself, but solely to the
grace of God which comes by faith in Jesus Christ; so that the very
will, through which we accept all the other gifts of God which lead us
on to His eternal gift, is itself prepared of the Lord, as the Scripture
says. <span id="fr_1298"></span>[1299](#fn_1298)
