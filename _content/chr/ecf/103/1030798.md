<span id="v.viii.xxiv-p1"></span> 23. But if moreover any not having
charity, which pertaineth to the unity of spirit and the bond of peace
whereby the Catholic Church is gathered and knit together, being
involved in any schism, doth, that he may not deny Christ, suffer
tribulations, straits, hunger, nakedness, persecution, perils, prisons,
bonds, torments, swords, or flames, or wild beasts, or the very cross,
through fear of hell and everlasting fire; in nowise is all this to be
blamed, nay rather this also is a patience meet to be praised. For we
cannot say that it would have been better for him that by denying Christ
he should suffer none of these things, which he did suffer by confessing
Him: but we must account that it will perhaps be more tolerable for him
in the judgment, than if by denying Christ he should avoid all those
things: so that what the Apostle saith, “If I shall give my body to be
burned, but have not charity, it profiteth me nothing,” <span
id="fr_2697"></span>[2698](#fn_2697) should be understood to profit
nothing for obtaining the kingdom of heaven, but not for having more
tolerable punishment to undergo in the last judgment.
