<p class="c39"><a name="iv.i.iv.v-p1"></A>  <span class="c2"><a name="iv.i.iv.v-p1.1"></A>Chapter 4.&#8212;The Glorification of the Son by the Father Does Not Prove Inequality.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.i.iv.v-p2"></A>6. But here also let them wake up if they can, who have thought this, too, to be a testimony on their side, to show that the Father <A NAME="page_40"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 40</FONT></A> <a name="iv.i.iv.v-Page_40"></A>is greater than the Son, because the Son hath said, &#8220;Father, glorify me.&#8221; Why, the Holy Spirit also glorifies Him. Pray, is the Spirit, too, greater than He? Moreover, if on that account the Holy Spirit glorifies the Son, because He shall receive of that which is the Son&#146;s, and shall therefore receive of that which is the Son&#146;s because all things that the Father has are the Son&#146;s also; it is evident that when the Holy Spirit glorifies the Son, the Father glorifies the Son. Whence it may be perceived that all things that the Father hath are not only of the Son, but also of the Holy Spirit, because the Holy Spirit is able to glorify the Son, whom the Father glorifies. But if he who glorifies is greater than he whom he glorifies, let them allow that those are equal who mutually glorify each other. But it is written, also, that the Son glorifies the Father; for He says, &#8220;I have glorified Thee on the earth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">224</FONT></A>
 Truly let them beware lest the Holy Spirit be thought greater than both, because He glorifies the Son whom the Father glorifies, while it is not written that He Himself is glorified either by the Father or by the Son.</p>
