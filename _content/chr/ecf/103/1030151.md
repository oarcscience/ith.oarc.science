<span id="iv.i.xiii.i-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xiii.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—A Trace of the Trinity Also In
the Outer Man.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xiii.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="c19"><span
id="iv.i.xiii.i-p2.1"></span> No</span> one doubts that, as the inner
man is endued with understanding, so is the outer with bodily sense. Let
us try, then, if we can, to discover in this outer man also, some trace,
however slight, of the Trinity, not that itself also is in the same
manner the image of God. For the opinion of the apostle is evident,
which declares the *inner* man to be renewed in the knowledge of God
after the image of Him that created him: <span
id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728) whereas he says also in another place,
“But though our *outer* man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by
day.” <span id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729) Let us seek, then, so far
as we can, in that which perishes, some image of the Trinity, if not so
express, yet perhaps more easy to be discerned. For that outer man also
is not called man to no purpose, but because there is in it some
likeness of the inner man. And owing to that very order of our condition
whereby we are made mortal and fleshly, we handle things visible more
easily and more familiarly than things intelligible; since the former
are outward, the latter inward; and the former are perceived by the
bodily sense, the latter are understood by the mind; and we ourselves,
*i.e.* our minds, are not sensible things, that is, bodies, but
intelligible things, since we are life. And yet, as I said, we are so
familiarly occupied with bodies, and our thought has projected itself
outwardly with so wonderful a proclivity towards bodies, that, when it
has been withdrawn from the uncertainty of things corporeal, that it may
be fixed with a much more certain and stable knowledge in that which is
spirit, it flies back to those bodies, and seeks rest there whence it
has drawn weakness. And to this its feebleness we must suit our
argument; so that, if we would endeavor at any time to distinguish more
aptly, and intimate more readily, the inward spiritual thing, we must
take examples of likenesses from outward things pertaining to the body.
The outer man, then, endued as he is with the bodily sense, is
conversant with bodies. And this bodily sense, as is easily observed, is
fivefold; seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching. But it is both a
good deal of trouble, and is not necessary, that we should inquire of
all these five senses about that which we seek. For that which one of
them declares to us, holds also good in the rest. Let us use, then,
principally the testimony of the eyes. For this bodily <span
id="page_145">p. 145</span> <span id="iv.i.xiii.i-Page_145"></span>sense
far surpasses the rest; and in proportion to its difference of kind, is
nearer to the sight of the mind.
