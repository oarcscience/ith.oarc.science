<span id="iv.ii.c-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.c-p1.1"></span>Chapter 98.—Predestination to Eternal Life is
Wholly of God’s Free Grace.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.c-p2"></span>And, moreover, who will be so foolish and
blasphemous as to say that God cannot change the evil wills of men,
whichever, whenever, and wheresoever He chooses, and direct them to what
is good? But when He does this He does it of mercy; when He does it not,
it is of justice that He does it not for “He hath mercy on whom He will
have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth.” <span
id="fr_1278"></span>[1279](#fn_1278) And when the apostle said this, he
was illustrating the grace of God, in connection with which he had just
spoken of the twins in the womb of Rebecca, “who being not yet born,
neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according
to election might stand, not of works, but of Him that calleth, it was
said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.” <span
id="fr_1279"></span>[1280](#fn_1279) And in reference to this matter he
quotes another prophetic testimony: “Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I
hated.” <span id="fr_1280"></span>[1281](#fn_1280) But perceiving how
what he had said might affect those who could not penetrate by their
understanding the depth of this grace: “What shall we say then?” he
says: “Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.” <span
id="fr_1281"></span>[1282](#fn_1281) For it seems unjust that, in the
absence of any merit or demerit, from good or evil works, God should
love the one and hate the other. Now, if the apostle had wished us to
understand that there were future good works of the one, and evil works
of the other, which of course God foreknew, he would never have said,
“not of works,” but, “of future works,” and in that way would have
solved the difficulty, or rather there would then have been no
difficulty to solve. As it is, however, after answering, “God forbid;”
that is, God forbid that there should be unrighteousness with God; he
goes on to prove that there is no unrighteousness in God’s doing this,
and says: “For He saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have
mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.” <span
id="fr_1282"></span>[1283](#fn_1282) Now, who but a fool would think
that God was unrighteous, either in inflicting penal justice on those
who had earned it, or in extending mercy to the unworthy? Then he draws
his conclusion: “So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that
runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.” <span
id="fr_1283"></span>[1284](#fn_1283) Thus both the twins were born
children of wrath, not on account of any works of their own, but because
they were bound in the fetters of that original condemnation which came
through Adam. But He who said, “I will have mercy on whom I will have
mercy,” loved Jacob of His undeserved grace, and hated Esau of His
deserved judgment. And as this judgment was due to both, the former
learnt from the case of the latter that the fact of the same punishment
not falling upon himself gave him no room to glory in any merit of his
own, but only in the riches of the divine grace; because “it is not of
him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth
mercy.” And indeed the whole face, and, if I may use the expression,
every lineament of the countenance of Scripture conveys by a very
profound analogy this wholesome warning to every one who looks carefully
into it, that he who glories should glory in the Lord. <span
