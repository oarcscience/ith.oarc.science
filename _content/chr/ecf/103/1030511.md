<span id="v.i.xxviii-p1"></span> 28. Far be it therefore that we say of
continence, of which Scripture saith. “And this very thing was wisdom,
to know whose gift it was,” <span id="fr_1911"></span>[1912](#fn_1911)
that even they possess it, who, by containing, either serve errors, or
overcome any lesser desires for this purpose, that they may fulfill
others, by the greatness of which they are overcome. But that continence
which is true, coming from above, wills not to repress some evils by
other evils, but to heal all evils by goods. And, briefly to comprehend
its mode of action, it is the place of continence to keep watch to
restrain and heal all delights whatsoever of lust, which are opposed to
the delight of wisdom. Whence without doubt they set it within too
narrow bounds, who limit it to restraining the lusts of the body alone:
certainly they speak better, who say that it pertains to Continence to
rule in general lust or desire. Which desire is set down as a fault, nor
is it only of the body, but also of the soul. For, if the desire of the
body be in fornications and drunkennesses; hard enmities, strifes,
emulations, lastly, hatreds, their exercise in the pleasure of the body,
and not rather in the motion and troubled states of the soul? Yet the
Apostle called all these “works of the flesh,” whether what pertained to
the soul, or what pertained properly to the flesh, calling forsooth the
man himself by the name of the flesh. <span
id="fr_1912"></span>[1913](#fn_1912) Forsooth they are the works of man,
whatsoever are not called works of God; forasmuch as man, who does
these, lives after himself, not after God, so far as he does these. But
there are other works of man, which are rather to be called works of
God. “For it is God,” <span id="fr_1913"></span>[1914](#fn_1913) saith
the Apostle, “Who <span id="page_392">p. 392</span> <span
id="v.i.xxviii-Page_392"></span>worketh in you both to will and to do,
according to His good pleasure.” Whence also is that, “For as many as
are led by the spirit of God, these are sons of God.” <span
