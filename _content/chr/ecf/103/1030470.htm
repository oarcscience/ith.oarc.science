<p class="c10"><a name="iv.vii.vi-p1"></A>  6. But this Only Son of God, the Father Almighty, let us see what He did for us, what He suffered for us. &#8220;Born of the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary.&#8221; He, so great God, equal with the Father, born of the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, born lowly, that thereby He might heal the proud. Man exalted himself and fell; God humbled Himself and raised him up. Christ&#146;s lowliness, what is it? God hath stretched out an hand to man laid low. We fell, He descended: we lay low, He stooped. Let us lay hold and rise, that we fall not into punishment. So then His stooping to us is this, &#8220;Born of the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary.&#8221; His very Nativity too as man, it is lowly, and it is lofty. Whence lowly? That as man He was born of men. Whence lofty? That He was born of a virgin. A virgin conceived, a virgin bore, and after the birth was a virgin still.</p>
