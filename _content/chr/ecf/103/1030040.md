<span id="iv.i.iv.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—The Vision of Daniel.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.xix-p2"></span>33. <span
id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342) I do not know in what manner these men
understand that the Ancient of Days appeared to Daniel, from whom the
Son of man, which He deigned to be for our sakes, is understood to have
received the kingdom; namely, from Him who says to Him in the Psalms,
“Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten Thee; ask of me, and I shall
give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance;” <span
id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343) and who has “put all things under His
feet.” <span id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344) If, however, both the
Father giving the kingdom, and the Son receiving it, appeared to Daniel
in bodily form, how can those men say that the Father never appeared to
the prophets, and, therefore, that He only ought to be understood to be
invisible whom no man has seen, nor can see? For Daniel has told us
thus: “I beheld,” he says, “till the thrones were set, <span
id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345) and the Ancient of Days did sit, whose
garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head like the pure wool:
His throne was like the fiery flame, and His wheels as burning fire; a
fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him: thousand thousands
ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before
Him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened,” etc. And a little
after, “I saw,” he says, “in the night visions, and behold, one like the
Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of
Days, and they brought Him near before Him. And there was given Him
dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and
languages should serve Him: His dominion is an everlasting dominion,
which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be
destroyed.” <span id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346) Behold the Father
giving, and the Son receiving, an eternal kingdom; and both are in the
sight of him who prophesies, in a visible form. It is not, therefore,
unsuitably believed that God the Father also was wont to appear in that
manner to mortals.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xix-p8"></span>34. Unless, perhaps, some one shall
say, that the Father is therefore not visible, because He appeared
within the sight of one who was dreaming; but that therefore the Son and
the Holy Spirit are visible, because Moses saw all those things being
awake; as if, forsooth, Moses saw the Word and the Wisdom of God with
fleshly eyes, or that even the human spirit which quickens that flesh
can be seen, or even that corporeal thing which is called wind;—how much
less can that Spirit of God be seen, who transcends the minds of all
men, and of angels, by the ineffable excellence of the divine substance?
Or can any one fall headlong into such an error as to dare to say, that
the Son and the Holy Spirit are visible also to men who are awake, but
that the Father is not visible except to those who dream? How, then, do
they understand that of the Father alone, “Whom no man hath seen, nor
can see.”? When men sleep, are they then not men? Or cannot He, who can
fashion the likeness of a body to signify Himself through the visions of
dreamers, also fashion that same bodily creature to signify Himself to
the eyes of those who are awake? Whereas His own very substance, whereby
He Himself is that which He is, cannot be shown by any bodily likeness
to one who sleeps, or by any bodily appearance to one who is awake; but
this not of the Father only, but also of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
And certainly, as to those who are moved by the visions of waking men to
believe that not the Father, but only the Son, or the Holy Spirit,
appeared to the corporeal sight of men,—to omit the great extent of the
sacred pages, and their manifold interpretation, such that no one of
sound reason ought to affirm that the person of the Father was nowhere
shown to the eyes of waking men by any corporeal appearance;—but, as I
said, to omit this, what do they say of our father Abraham, who was
certainly awake and ministering, when, after Scripture had premised,
“The Lord appeared unto Abraham,” not one, or two, but three men
appeared to him; no one of whom is said to have stood prominently above
the others, no one more than the others to have shone with greater
glory, or to have acted more authoritatively? <span
id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347)

<span id="iv.i.iv.xix-p10"></span>35. Wherefore, since in that our
threefold division we determined to inquire, <span
id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348) first, <span id="page_54">p. 54</span>
<span id="iv.i.iv.xix-Page_54"></span>whether the Father, or the Son, or
the Holy Spirit; or whether sometimes the Father, sometimes the Son,
sometimes the Holy Spirit; or whether, without any distinction of
persons, as it is said, the one and only God, that is, the Trinity
itself, appeared to the fathers through those forms of the creature: now
that we have examined, so far as appeared to be sufficient what places
of the Holy Scriptures we could, a modest and cautious consideration of
divine mysteries leads, as far as I can judge, to no other conclusion,
unless that we may not rashly affirm which person of the Trinity
appeared to this or that of the fathers or the prophets in some body or
likeness of body, unless when the context attaches to the narrative some
probable intimations on the subject. For the nature itself, or
substance, or essence, or by whatever other name that very thing, which
is God, whatever it be, is to be called, cannot be seen corporeally: but
we must believe that by means of the creature made subject to Him, not
only the Son, or the Holy Spirit, but also the Father, may have given
intimations of Himself to mortal senses by a corporeal form or likeness.
And since the case stands thus, that this second book may not extend to
an immoderate length, let us consider what remains in those which
follow.
