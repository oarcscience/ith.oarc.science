<span id="v.vii.xix-p1"></span> 18. And a little after he saith, “For as
touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to
write to you. For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast
of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your
zeal hath provoked very many. Yet have we sent the brethren, lest our
boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye
may be ready: lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you
unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this
substance. Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that
they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand this your long
promised benediction, that the same might be ready, as benediction, and
not as covetousness. But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall
reap also sparingly; and he which soweth in benediction shall reap also
in benediction. Every man according as he hath purposed in his heart,
not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. And
God is able to make all grace abound in you; that ye, always having all
sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work: as it is
written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his
righteousness remaineth for ever. But He that ministereth seed to the
sower will both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed
sown, and increase the growing fruits of your righteousness; that ye may
be enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through
us thanksgiving to God: for the administration of this service not only
supplieth the want of the saints, but makes them also to abound by
thanksgiving unto God of many, while by the proof of this ministration
they glorify God for the obedience of your confession unto the Gospel of
Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;
and in the praying for you of them which long after you for the
excellent grace of God in you. Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable
gift.” <span id="fr_2537"></span>[2538](#fn_2537) In what richness of
holy gladness must the Apostle have been steeped, while he speaks of the
mutual supply of the need of Christ’s soldiers and His other
subjects, <span id="fr_2538"></span>[2539](#fn_2538) on the one part of
carnal things to those, on the other of spiritual things to these, to
exclaim as he does, and as it were in repletion of holy joys to burst
out <span id="fr_2539"></span>[2540](#fn_2539) with, “Thanks be to God
for His unspeakable gift!”
