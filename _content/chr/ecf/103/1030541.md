<span id="v.ii.xxv-p1"></span> 24. Marriage, I say, is a good, and may
be, by sound reason, defended against all calumnies. But with the
marriage of the holy fathers, I inquire not what marriage, but what
continence, is on a level: or rather not marriage with marriage; for it
is an equal gift in all cases given to the mortal nature of men; but men
who use marriage, forasmuch as I find not, to compare with other men who
used marriage in a far other spirit, we must require what continent
persons admit of being compared with those married persons. Unless,
haply, Abraham could not contain from marriage, for the sake of the
kingdom of heaven, he who, for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, could
fearless sacrifice his only pledge of offspring, for whose sake marriage
was dear!
