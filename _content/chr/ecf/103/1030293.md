id="iv.ii.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 43.—Baptism and the Grace Which It
Typifies are Open to All, Both Infants and Adults.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xlv-p2"></span>For from the infant newly born to the old
man bent with age, as there is none shut out from baptism, so there is
none who in baptism does not die to sin. But infants die only to
original sin; those who are older die also to all the sins which their
evil lives have added to the sin which they brought with them.
