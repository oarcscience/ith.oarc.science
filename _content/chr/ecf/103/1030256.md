id="iv.ii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Controversy Out of Place in a
Handbook Like the Present.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.viii-p2"></span>Now you ask of me a handbook, that is,
one that can be carried in the hand, not one to load your shelves. To
return, then, to the three graces through which, as I have said, God
should be worshipped—faith, hope, and love: to state what are the true
and proper objects of each of these is easy. But to defend this true
doctrine against the assaults of those who hold an opposite opinion,
requires much fuller and more elaborate instruction. And the true way to
obtain this instruction is not to have a short treatise put into one’s
hands, but to have a great zeal kindled in one’s heart.
