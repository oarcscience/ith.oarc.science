<span id="iv.v.ix-p1"></span> 9. If they suspect this, let them examine
carefully the copies <span id="fr_1680"></span>[1681](#fn_1680) of our
enemies the Jews. There let them read those things of which we have made
mention, foretold concerning Christ in Whom we believe, and the Church
whom we discern from the toilsome beginning of faith even unto the
eternal blessedness of the kingdom. But, whilst they read, let them not
wonder that they, whose are the books, understand not by reason of the
darkness of enmity. For that they would not understand was foretold
beforehand by the same Prophets; which it behoved should be fulfilled in
like manner as the rest, and that by the secret and just judgment of God
due punishment should be rendered to their deserts. He indeed, Whom they
crucified, and unto Whom they gave gall and vinegar, although when
hanging upon the Tree, by reason of those whom He had been about to lead
forth from darkness into light, He said unto the Father, “Forgive them,
for they know not what they do;” <span
id="fr_1681"></span>[1682](#fn_1681) yet by reason of those whom through
more hidden causes He had been about to desert, by the Prophet so long
before foretold, “They gave Me gall for My meat, and in My thirst they
gave Me vinegar to drink; let their table become a snare before them,
and a recompense, and a stumbling-block: let their eyes be darkened that
they see not, and ever bow Thou down their back.” <span
id="fr_1682"></span>[1683](#fn_1682) Thus, having with them the clearest
testimonies of our cause, they walk round about with eyes darkened, that
by their means those testimonies may be proved, wherein they themselves
are disapproved. Therefore was it brought to pass, that they should not
be so blotted out, as that this same sect should altogether exist not:
but it was scattered abroad upon the earth, in order that, carrying with
it the prophecies of the grace conferred upon us, more surely to
convince unbelievers, it might every where profit us. And this very
thing which I assert, receive ye after what manner it was prophesied of:
“Slay them not,” saith He, “lest at any time they forget Thy law, but
scatter them abroad in Thy might.” <span
id="fr_1683"></span>[1684](#fn_1683) Therefore they were not slain, in
that they forgot not those things which were read and heard among them.
For if they were altogether to forget, albeit they understand not, the
Holy Scriptures, they would be slain in the Jewish ritual itself;
because, when the Jews should know nothing of the Law and of the
Prophets, they would be unable to profit us. Therefore they were not
slain, but scattered abroad; in order that, although they should not
have in faith, whence they might be saved; yet they should retain in
their memory, whence we might be helped; in their books our supporters,
in their hearts our enemies, in their copies our witnesses.
