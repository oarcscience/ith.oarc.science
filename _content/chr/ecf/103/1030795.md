<span id="v.viii.xxi-p1"></span> 20. Let thus much have been said with
regard to charity, without which in us there cannot be true patience,
because in good men it is the love of God which endureth all things, as
in bad men the lust of the world. But this love is in us by the Holy
Spirit which was given us. Whence, of Whom cometh in us love, of Him
cometh patience. But the lust of the world, when it patiently bears the
burdens of any manner of calamity, boasts of the strength of its own
will, like as of the stupor of disease, not robustness of health. This
boasting is insane: it is not the language of patience, but of dotage. A
will like this in that degree seems more patient of bitter ills, in
which it is more greedy of temporal good things, because more empty of
eternal.
