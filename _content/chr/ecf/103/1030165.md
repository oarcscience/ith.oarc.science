id="iv.i.xiv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—The Higher Reason Which Belongs
to Contemplation, and the Lower Which Belongs to Action, are in One
Mind.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xiv.iii-p2"></span>3. But that of our own which thus has
to do with the handling of corporeal and temporal things, is indeed
rational, in that it is not common to us with the beasts; but it is
drawn, as it were, out of that rational substance of our mind, by which
we depend upon and cleave to the intelligible and unchangeable truth,
and which is deputed to handle and direct the inferior things. For as
among all the beasts there was not found for the man a help like unto
him, unless one were taken from himself, and formed to be his consort:
so for that mind, by which we consult the supernal and inward truth,
there is no like help for such employment as man’s nature requires among
things corporeal out of those parts of the soul which we have in common
with the beasts. And so a certain part of our reason, not separated so
as to sever unity, but, as it were, diverted so as to be a help to
fellowship, is parted off for the performing of its proper work. And as
the twain is one flesh in the case of male and female, so in the mind
one nature embraces our intellect and action, or our counsel and
performance, or our reason and rational appetite, or whatever other more
significant terms there may be by which to express them; so that, as it
was said of the former, “And they two shall be in one flesh,” <span
id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744) it may be said of these, they two are
in one mind.
