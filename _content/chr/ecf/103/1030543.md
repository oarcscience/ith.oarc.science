<span id="v.ii.xxvii-p1"></span> 26. But, in order that it may be more
clearly understood, how there may be virtue in habit, although it be not
in work, I speak of an example, about which no Catholic Christian can
doubt. For that our Lord Jesus Christ in truth of flesh hungered and
thirsted, ate and drank, no one doubts of such as out of the Gospel are
believers. What, then, was there not in Him the virtue of continence
from meat and drink, as great as in John Baptist? “For John came neither
eating nor drinking; and they said, He hath a devil; the Son of Man came
both eating and drinking; and they said, “Lo, a glutton and wine-bibber,
a friend of publicans and sinners.” <span
id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006) What, are not such things said also
against them of His household, our fathers, from another kind of using
of things earthy, so far as pertains to sexual intercourse; “Lo, men
lustful and unclean, lovers of women and lewdness?” And yet as in Him
that was not true, although it were true that He abstained not, even as
John, from eating and drinking, for Himself saith most plainly and
truly, “John came, not eating, nor drinking; the Son of Man came eating
and drinking:” so neither is this true in these Fathers; although there
hath come now the Apostle of Christ, not wedded, nor begetting, so that
the heathen say of him, He was a magician; but there came then the
Prophet of Christ, marrying and begetting sons, so that the Manichees
say of him, He was a man fond of women: “And wisdom,” saith He, “hath
been justified of her children.” <span
id="fr_2007"></span>[2008](#fn_2007) What the Lord there added, after He
had thus spoken of John and of Himself; “But wisdom,” saith He, “hath
been justified of her children.” Who see that the virtue of continence
ought to exist even in the habit of the soul, but to be shown forth in
deed, according to opportunity of things and times; even as the virtue
of patience of holy martyrs appeared in deed; but of the rest equally
holy was in habit. Wherefore, even as there is not unequal desert of
patience in Peter, who suffered, and in John, who suffered not; so there
is not unequal desert of continence in John who made no trial of
marriage, <span id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008) and in Abraham, who
begat sons. For both the celibate of the one, and the marriage estate of
the other, did service as soldiers to Christ, as times were allotted;
but John had continence in work also, but Abraham in habit alone.
