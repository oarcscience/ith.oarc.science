<span id="v.iii.li-p1"></span> 50. But, again, lest by occasion of this
sentence, any one should sin with deadly security, and should allow
himself to be carried away, as though his sins were soon by easy
confession to be blotted out, he straightway added, “My little children,
these things have I written unto you, that ye sin not; and, if one shall
have sinned, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
righteous, and Himself is a propitiation of our sins.” <span
id="fr_2206"></span>[2207](#fn_2206) Let no one therefore depart from
sin as though about to return to it, nor bind himself as it were by
compact of alliance of this kind with unrighteousness, so as to take
delight rather to confess it than to shun it. But, forasmuch as even
upon such as are busy and on the watch not to sin, there creep by
stealth, in a certain way, from human weakness, sins, however small,
however few, yet not none; these same themselves become great and
grievous, in case pride shall have added to them increase and weight:
but by the Priest, Whom we have in the heavens, if by pious humility
they be destroyed, they are with all ease cleansed.
