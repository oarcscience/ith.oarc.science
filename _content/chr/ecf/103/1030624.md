<span id="v.iv.xii-p1"></span> 11. But thou who both hast sons, and
livest in that end of the world, wherein now is the time not of casting
stones, but of gathering; not of embracing, but of abstaining from
embracing; <span id="fr_2243"></span>[2244](#fn_2243) when the Apostle
cries out, “But this I say, brethren, the time is short; it remains,
that both they who have wives be as not having;” <span
id="fr_2244"></span>[2245](#fn_2244) assuredly if thou hadst sought a
second marriage, it would have been no obedience of prophecy or law, no
carnal desire even of family, but a mark of incontinence alone. For you
would have done what the Apostle says, after he had said, “It is good
for them, if they shall have so continued, even as I;” <span
id="fr_2245"></span>[2246](#fn_2245) forsooth he straightway added, “But
if they contain not themselves, let them marry; for I had rather that
they marry than be burned.” For this he said, in order that the evil of
unbridled desire might not be carried headlong into criminal baseness,
being taken up by the honest estate of marriage. But thanks be to the
Lord, in that thou hast given birth to what thou wouldest not be, and
the virginity of thy child hath compensated for the loss of thy
virginity. For Christian doctrine, having diligent question made of it,
makes answer, that a first marriage also now at this time is to be
despised, unless incontinence stand in the way. For he, who said, “If
they contain not themselves, let them marry,” could have said, “If they
have not sons, let them marry,” if, when now after theResurrection and
Preaching of Christ, there is unto all nations so great and abundant
supply of sons to be spiritually begotten, it were any such duty to
beget sons after the flesh as it was in the first times. And, whereas in
another place he saith, “But I will that the younger marry, bear
children, be mothers of families,” <span
id="fr_2246"></span>[2247](#fn_2246) he commends with apostolic sobriety
and authority the good of marriage, but doth not impose the duty of
bearing, as though in order to obey the law, even on those who “receive”
the good of continence. Lastly, why he had said this, he unfolds, when
he adds and says, “To give no occasion of speaking evil to the
adversary; for already certain have turned back after Satan:” that by
these words of his we may understand, that those, whom he would have
marry, could have done better to contain than marry; but better to marry
than to go back after Satan, that is, to fall away from that excellent
purpose of virginal or widowed chastity, by looking back to things that
are behind, and perish. Wherefore, such as contain not themselves, let
them marry before they make profession of continence, before they vow
unto God, what, if they pay not, they are justly condemned. Forsooth in
another place he saith of such, “For when they have lived in delights in
Christ, they wish to marry: having condemnation, in that they have made
of none effect their first faith;” <span
id="fr_2247"></span>[2248](#fn_2247) that is, they have turned aside
their will from the purpose of continence unto marriage. Forsooth they
have made of none effect the faith, whereby they formerly vowed what
they were unwilling by perseverance to fulfill. Therefore the good of
marriage is indeed ever a good: but in the people of God it was at one
time an act of obedience unto the law; now it is a remedy for weakness,
but in certain a solace of human nature. Forsooth to be engaged in the
getting of children, not after the fashion of dogs by promiscuous use of
females, but by honest order of marriage, is not an affection such as we
are to blame in a man; yet this affection itself the Christian mind,
having thoughts of heavenly things, in a more praiseworthy manner
surpasses and overcomes.
