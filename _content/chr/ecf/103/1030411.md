Judgment.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ix-p2"></span>15. We believe also, that at the most
seasonable time <span class="c19"><span id="iv.iv.ix-p2.1"></span>He
Will Come from Thence, and Will Judge the Quick and the Dead</span>:
whether by these terms are signified the righteous and sinners, or
whether it be the case that those persons are here called the *quick*,
whom at that period He shall find, previous to \[their\] death, <span
id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585) upon the earth, while the *dead*
denote those who shall rise again at His advent. This temporal
dispensation not only *is*, as holds good of that generation which
respects His being God, but also *hath been* and *shall be*. For our
Lord hath been upon the earth, and at present He is in heaven, and
\[hereafter\] He *shall be* in His brightness as the Judge of the quick
and the dead. For He shall yet come, even so as He has ascended,
according to the authority which is contained in the Acts of the
Apostles. <span id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586) It is in accordance
with this temporal dispensation, therefore, that He speaks in the
Apocalypse, where it is written in this wise: “These things saith He,
who is, and who was, and who is to come.” <span
