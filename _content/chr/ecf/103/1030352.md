id="iv.ii.civ-p1.1"></span>Chapter 102.—The Will of the Omnipotent God
is Never Defeated, and is Never Evil.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.civ-p2"></span>But however strong may be the purposes
either of angels or of men, whether of good or bad, whether these
purposes fall in with the will of God or run counter to it, the will of
the Omnipotent is never defeated; and His will never can be evil;
because even when it inflicts evil it is just, and what is just is
certainly not evil. The omnipotent God, then, whether in mercy He
pitieth whom He will, or in judgment hardeneth whom He will, is never
unjust in what He does, never does anything except of His own free-will,
and never wills anything that He does not perform.
