id="iv.ii.lxxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 84.—The Resurrection of the Body
Gives Rise to Numerous Questions.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxxxvi-p2"></span>Now, as to the resurrection of the
body, —not a resurrection such as some have had, who came back to life
for a time and died again, but a resurrection to eternal life, as the
body of Christ Himself rose again,—I do not see how I can discuss the
matter briefly, and at the same time give a satisfactory answer to all
the questions that are ordinarily raised about it. Yet that the bodies
of all men—both those who have been born and those who shall be born,
both those who have died and those who shall die—shall be raised again,
no Christian ought to have the shadow of a doubt.
