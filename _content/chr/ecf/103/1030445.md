of any law, or power of gainsayers, or vile character of persons
consecrated, or shameful report, or newness of institution, or hidden
profession, to recall us from, and forbid us, the search? There is
nothing of these. All laws divine and human allow us to seek the
Catholic Faith; but to hold and exercise it is allowed us at any rate by
human law, even if so long as we are in error there be a doubt
concerning divine law; no enemy alarms our weakness, (although truth and
the salvation of the soul, in case being diligently sought it be not
found where it may with most safety, ought to be sought at any risk);
the degrees of all ranks and powers most devotedly minister to this
divine worship; the name of religion is most honorable and most famous.
What, I pray, hinders to search out and discuss with pious and careful
enquiry, whether there be here that which it must needs be few know and
guard in entire purity, although the goodwill and affection of all
nations conspire in its favor?
