<span id="v.vi.xii-p1"></span> 11. “But, hidden wolves,” thou wilt say,
“clad in sheep’s clothing, and privily and grievously wasting the Lord’s
flock, can we no otherwise find out.” Whence then have the
Priscillianists become known, ere this way of hunting for them with lies
was ex-cogitated? Whence was their very author, more cunning doubtless,
and therefore more covert, got at in his bed? Whence so many and so
great persons made manifest and condemned, and the others innumerable
partly corrected, partly as if corrected, and in the Church’s compassion
gathered into her fold? For many ways giveth the Lord, when He hath
compassion, whereby we may come to the discovery of them: two of which
are more happy than others; namely, that either they whom they have
wished to seduce, or they whom they had already seduced, shall, when
they repent and are converted, point them out. Which is more easily
effected, if their nefarious error, not by lying tricks, but by truthful
<span id="page_486">p. 486</span> <span
id="v.vi.xii-Page_486"></span>reasonings be overthrown. In the writing
of which it behoves thee to bestow thy pains, since God hath bestowed
the gift that thou canst do this: which wholesome writings whereby their
insane perversity is destroyed, becoming more and more known, and being
by catholics, whether prelates who speak in the congregations, or any
studious men full of zeal for God, every where diffused, these will be
holy nets in which they may be caught truthfully, not with lies hunted
after. For so being taken, either, of their own accord, they will
confess what they have been, and others whom they know to be of the evil
fellowship they will either kindly <span
id="fr_2394"></span>[2395](#fn_2394) correct, or mercifully betray. Or
else, if they shall be ashamed to confess what with long-continued
simulation they have concealed, by the hidden hand of God healing them
shall they be made whole.
