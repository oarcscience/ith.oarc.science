<span id="v.viii.xxvi-p1"></span> 25. So then, as we are not to deny
that this is the gift of God, we are thus to understand that there be
some gifts of God possessed by the sons of that Jerusalem which is
above, <span id="fr_2699"></span>[2700](#fn_2699) and free, and mother
of us all, (for these are in some sort the hereditary possessions in
which we are “heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ:”) but some other
which may be received even by the sons of concubines to whom carnal Jews
and schismatics or heretics are compared. For though it be written,
“Cast out the bondmaid and her son, for the son of the bondmaid shall
not be heir with my son Isaac:” <span
id="fr_2700"></span>[2701](#fn_2700) and though God said to Abraham, “In
Isaac shall thy seed be called:” which the Apostle hath so interpreted
as to say, “That is, not they which be sons of the flesh, these be the
sons of God; but the sons of the promise are counted for the
seed;” <span id="fr_2701"></span>[2702](#fn_2701) that we might
understand the seed of Abraham in regard of Christ to pertain by reason
of Christ to the sons of God, who are Christ’s body and members, that is
to say, the Church of God, one, true, very-begotten, catholic, holding
the godly faith; not the faith which works through elation or fear, but
“which worketh by love;” <span id="fr_2702"></span>[2703](#fn_2702)
nevertheless, even the sons of the concubines, when Abraham sent them
away from his son Isaac, he did not omit to bestow upon them some gifts,
that they might not be left in every way empty, but not that they should
be held as heirs. For so we read: “And Abraham gave all his estate unto
Isaac; and to the sons of his concubines gave Abraham gifts, and sent
them away from his son Isaac.” <span
id="fr_2703"></span>[2704](#fn_2703) If then we be sons of Jerusalem the
free, let us understand that other be the gifts of them which are put
out of the inheritance, other the gifts of them which be heirs. For
these be the heirs, to whom is said, “Ye have not received the spirit of
bondage again to fear, but ye have received the spirit of adoption of
sons, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.” <span
