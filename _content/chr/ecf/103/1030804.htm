<p class="c10"><a name="v.ix.ii-p1"></A>  1. Long time, my venerable fellow-bishop Paulinus, have I been thy Holiness&#146;s debtor for an answer; even since thou wrotest to me by them of the household&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2707"></A><A HREF="#fn_2707"><FONT SIZE="1">2708</FONT></A>
 of our most religious daughter Flora, asking of me whether it profit any man after death that his body is buried at the memorial of some Saint. This, namely, had the said widow begged of thee for her son deceased in those parts, and thou hadst written her an answer, consoling her, and announcing to her concerning the body of the faithful young man Cynegius, that the thing which she with motherly and pious affection desired was done, to wit, by placing it in the basilica of most blessed Felix the Confessor. Upon which occasion it came to pass, that by the same bearers of thy letter thou didst write also to me, raising the like question, and craving that I would answer what I thought of this matter, at the same time not forbearing to say what are thine own sentiments. For thou sayest that to thy thinking these be no empty motions of religious and faithful minds, which take this care for their deceased friends. Thou addest, moreover, that it cannot be void of effect&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2708"></A><A HREF="#fn_2708"><FONT SIZE="1">2709</FONT></A>
 that the whole Church is wont to supplicate for the departed: so that hence it may be further conjectured that it doth profit a person after death, if by the faith of his friends for the interment of his body such a spot be provided wherein may be apparent the aid, likewise in this way sought, of the Saints.</p>
