<span id="v.ix.x-p1"></span> 9. And yet, by reason of that affection of
the human heart, whereby “no man ever hateth his own flesh,” <span
id="fr_2730"></span>[2731](#fn_2730) if men have reason to know that
after their death their bodies will lack any thing which in each man’s
nation or country the wonted order of sepulture demandeth, it makes them
sorrowful as men; and that which after death reacheth not unto them,
they do before death fear for their bodies: so that we find in the Books
of Kings, God by one prophet threatening another prophet who had
transgressed His word, that his carcase should not be brought into the
sepulchre of his fathers. Which the Scripture hath on this wise: “Thus
saith the Lord, Because thou hast been disobedient to the mouth of the
Lord, and hast not kept the charge which the Lord thy God commanded
thee, and hast returned and eaten bread and drunk water in the place in
which He commanded thee not to eat bread, nor drink water, thy carcase
shall not be brought into the sepulchre of thy fathers.” <span
id="fr_2731"></span>[2732](#fn_2731) Now if in considering what account
is to be made of this punishment, we go by the Gospel, where we have
learned that after the slaying of the body there is no cause to fear
lest the lifeless members should suffer any thing, it is not even to be
called a punishment. But if we consider a man’s human affection towards
his own flesh, it was possible for him to be frightened or saddened,
while living, by that of which he would have no sense when dead: and
this was a punishment, because the mind was pained by that thing about
to happen to its body, howsoever when it did happen it would feel no
pain. To this intent, namely, it pleased the Lord to punish His servant,
who not of his own contumacy had spurned to fulfill His command, but by
deceit of another’s falsehood thought himself to be obeying when he
obeyed not. For it is not to be thought that he was killed by the teeth
of the beast as one whose soul should be thence snatched away to the
torments of hell: seeing that over his very body the same lion which had
killed it did keep watch, while moreover the beast on which he rode was
left unhurt, and along with that fierce beast did with intrepid presence
stand there beside his master’s corpse. By which marvellous sign it
appeareth, that the man of God was, say rather, checked temporally even
unto death, than punished after death. Of which matter, the Apostle when
on account of certain offenses he had mentioned the sicknesses and
deaths of many, says, “For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be
judged of the Lord. But when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord,
that we may not be condemned with the world.” <span
id="fr_2732"></span>[2733](#fn_2732) That Prophet, truly, the very man
who had beguiled him, did with much respect bury in his own tomb, and
took order for his own burying beside his bones: in hope that thereby
his own bones might be spared, when, according to the prophecy of that
man <span id="page_544">p. 544</span> <span
id="v.ix.x-Page_544"></span>of God, Josiah king of Judah did in that
land disinter the bones of many dead, and with the same bones defile the
sacrilegious altars which had been set up for the graven images. For he
spared that tomb in which lay the prophet who more than three hundred
years before predicted those things, and for his sake neither was the
sepulture of him who had seduced him violated. By that affection namely,
which causes that no man ever hateth his own flesh, this man had taken
forethought for his carcase, who had slain with a lie his own soul. By
reason then of this, the natural love which every man hath for his own
flesh, it was both to the one a punishment to learn that he should not
be in the sepulchre of his fathers, and to the other a care to take
order beforehand that his own bones should be spared, if he should lie
beside him whose sepulchre no man should violate.
