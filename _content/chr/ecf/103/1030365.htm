<p class="c39"><a name="iv.ii.cxvii-p1"></A>  <span class="c2"><a name="iv.ii.cxvii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 115.&#8212;The Seven Petitions of the Lord&#146;s Prayer, According to Matthew.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.ii.cxvii-p2"></A>Accordingly, in the Gospel according to Matthew the Lord&#146;s Prayer seems to embrace seven petitions, three of which ask for eternal blessings, and the remaining four for temporal; these latter, however, being necessary antecedents to the attainment of the eternal. For when we say, &#8220;Hallowed be Thy name: Thy kingdom come: Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1310"></A><A HREF="#fn_1310"><FONT SIZE="1">1311</FONT></A>
 (which some have interpreted, not unfairly, in body as well as in spirit), we ask for blessings that are to be enjoyed for ever; which are indeed begun in this world, and grow in us as we grow in grace, but in their perfect state, which is to be looked for in another life, shall be a possession for evermore. But when we say, &#8220;Give us this day our daily bread: and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors: and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1311"></A><A HREF="#fn_1311"><FONT SIZE="1">1312</FONT></A>
 who does not see that we ask for blessings that have reference to the wants of this present life? In that eternal life, where we hope to live for ever, the hallowing of God&#146;s name, and His kingdom, and His will in our spirit and body, shall be brought to perfection, and shall endure to everlasting. But our <i>daily</i> bread is so called because there is here constant need for as much nourishment as the spirit and the flesh demand, whether we understand the expression spiritually, or carnally, or in both senses. It is here too that we need the forgiveness that we ask, for it is here that we commit the sins; here are the temptations which allure or drive us into sin; here, in a word, is the evil from which we desire deliverance: but in that other world there shall be none of these things.</p>
