<span id="iv.i.xiv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xiv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—The Opinion Which Devises an
Image of the Trinity in the Marriage of Male and Female, and in Their
Offspring.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xiv.v-p2"></span>5. Accordingly they do not seem to me to
advance a probable opinion, who lay it down that a trinity of the image
of God in three persons, so far as regards human nature, can so be
discovered as to be completed in the marriage of male and female and in
their offspring; in that the man himself, as it were, indicates the
person of the Father, but that which has so proceeded from him as to be
born, that of the Son; and so the third person as of the Spirit, is,
they say, the woman, who has so proceeded from the man as not herself to
be either son or daughter, <span id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745)
although it was by her conception that the offspring was born. For the
Lord hath said of the Holy Spirit that He proceedeth from the
Father, <span id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746) and yet he is not a son.
In this erroneous opinion, then, the only point probably alleged, and
indeed sufficiently shown according to the faith of the Holy Scripture,
is this,—in the account of the original creation of the woman,—that what
so comes into existence from some person as to make another person,
cannot in every case be called a son; since the person of the woman came
into existence from the person of the man, and yet she is not called his
daughter. All the rest of this opinion is in truth so absurd, nay indeed
so false, that it is most easy to refute it. For I pass over such a
thing, as to think the Holy Spirit to be the mother of the Son of God,
and the wife of the Father; since perhaps it may be answered that these
things offend us in carnal things, because we think of bodily
conceptions and births. Although these very things themselves are most
chastely thought of by the pure, to whom all things are pure; but to the
defiled and unbelieving, of whom <span id="page_157">p. 157</span> <span
id="iv.i.xiv.v-Page_157"></span>both the mind and conscience are
polluted, nothing is pure; <span id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747) so
that even Christ, born of a virgin according to the flesh, is a
stumbling-block to some of them. But yet in the case of those supreme
spiritual things, after the likeness of which those kinds of the
inferior creature also are made although most remotely, and where there
is nothing that can be injured and nothing corruptible, nothing born in
time, nothing formed from that which is formless, or whatever like
expressions there may be; yet they ought not to disturb the sober
prudence of any one, lest in avoiding empty disgust he run into
pernicious error. Let him accustom himself so to find in corporeal
things the traces of things spiritual, that when he begins to ascend
upwards from thence, under the guidance of reason, in order to attain to
the unchangeable truth itself through which these things were made, he
may not draw with himself to things above what he despises in things
below. For no one ever blushed to choose for himself wisdom as a wife,
because the name of wife puts into a man’s thoughts the corruptible
connection which consists in begetting children; or because in truth
wisdom itself is a woman in sex, since it is expressed in both Greek and
Latin tongues by a word of the feminine gender.
