<p class="c10"><a name="iv.vi.vii-p1"></A>  6. All these ways our Lord Jesus Christ and His Apostles used. For when it had been objected that His disciples had plucked the ears of corn on the sabbath-day, the instance was taken from history; &#8220;Have ye not read,&#8221; saith He, &#8220;what David did when he was an hungered, and they that were with him; how he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but only for the priests?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1700"></A><A HREF="#fn_1700"><FONT SIZE="1">1701</FONT></A>
