<span id="v.vi.xiii-p1"></span> 12. “But,” thou wilt say, “we more
easily penetrate their concealment if we pretend to be ourselves what
they are.” If this were lawful or expedient, Christ might have
instructed his sheep that they should come clad in wolves’ clothing to
the wolves, and by the cheat of this artifice discover them: which He
hath not said, no, not when He foretold that He would send them forth in
the midst of wolves. <span id="fr_2395"></span>[2396](#fn_2395) But thou
wilt say: “They needed not at that time to have inquisition made for
them, being most manifest wolves; but their bite and savageness were to
be endured.” What, when foretelling later times, He said that ravening
wolves would come in sheep’s clothing? Was there not room there to give
this advice and say, And do ye, that ye may find them out, assume
wolves’ clothing, but within be ye sheep still? Not this saith He: but
when he had said, “Many will come to you in sheep’s clothing, but within
are ravening wolves;” <span id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396) He went
on to say, not, By your lies, but, “By their fruits ye shall know them.”
By truth must we beware of, by truth must we take, by truth must we
kill, lies. Be it far from us, that the blasphemies of the ignorant we
by wittingly blaspheming should overcome: far from us, that the evils of
deceitful men we by imitating should guard against. For how shall we
guard against them if in order to guard against them we shall have them?
For if in order that he may be caught who blasphemes unwittingly, I
shall blaspheme wittingly, worse is the thing I do than that which I
catch. If in order that he may be found who denies Christ unwittingly, I
shall deny Him wittingly, to his undoing will he follow me whom I shall
so find, since in order that I may find him out, I first am undone.
