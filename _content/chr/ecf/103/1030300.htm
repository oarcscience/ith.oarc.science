<p class="c39"><a name="iv.ii.lii-p1"></A>  <span class="c2"><a name="iv.ii.lii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 50.&#8212;Christ Took Away Not Only the One Original Sin, But All the Other Sins that Have Been Added to It.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.ii.lii-p2"></A>With this difference: the first man brought one sin into the world, but this man took away not only that one sin, but all that He found added to it. Hence the apostle says: <A NAME="page_254"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 254</FONT></A> <a name="iv.ii.lii-Page_254"></A>&#8220;And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1173"></A><A HREF="#fn_1173"><FONT SIZE="1">1174</FONT></A>
 For it is evident that the one sin which we bring with us by nature would, even if it stood alone, bring us under condemnation; but the free gift justifies man from many offenses: for each man, in addition to the one sin which, in common with all his kind, he brings with him by nature, has committed many sins that are strictly his own.</p>
