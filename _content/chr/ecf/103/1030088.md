<span id="iv.i.vii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.vii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—What is Said Relatively in the
Trinity.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vii.xi-p2"></span>12. But whereas, in the same Trinity,
some things severally are specially predicated, these are in no way said
in reference to themselves in themselves, but either in mutual
reference, or in respect to the creature; and, therefore, it is manifest
that such things are spoken relatively, not in the way of substance. For
the Trinity is called one God, great, good, eternal, omnipotent; and the
same God Himself may be called His own deity, His own magnitude, His own
goodness, His own eternity, His own omnipotence: but the Trinity cannot
in the same way be called the Father, except perhaps metaphorically, in
respect to the creature, on account of the adoption of sons. For that
which is written, “Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord,” <span
id="fr_582"></span>[583](#fn_582) ought certainly not to be understood
as if the Son were excepted, or the Holy Spirit were excepted; which one
Lord our God we rightly call also our Father, as regenerating us by His
grace. Neither can the Trinity in any wise be called the Son, but it can
be called, in its entirety, the Holy Spirit, according to that which is
written, “God is a Spirit;” <span id="fr_583"></span>[584](#fn_583)
because both the Father is a spirit and the Son is a spirit, and the
Father is holy and the Son is holy. Therefore, since the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit are one God, and certainly God is holy, and God is a
spirit, the Trinity can be called also the Holy Spirit. But yet that
Holy Spirit, who is not the Trinity, but is understood as in the
Trinity, is spoken of in His proper name of the Holy Spirit relatively,
since He is referred both to the Father and to the Son, because the Holy
Spirit is the Spirit both of the Father and of the Son. But the relation
is not itself apparent in that name, but it is apparent when He is
called the gift of God; <span id="fr_584"></span>[585](#fn_584) for He
is the gift of the Father and of the Son, because “He proceeds from the
Father,” <span id="fr_585"></span>[586](#fn_585) as the Lord says; and
because that which the apostle says, “Now, if any man have not the
Spirit of Christ, he is none of His,” <span
id="fr_586"></span>[587](#fn_586) he says certainly of the Holy Spirit
Himself. When we say, therefore, the gift of the giver, and the giver of
the gift, we speak in both cases relatively in reciprocal reference.
Therefore the Holy Spirit is a certain unutterable communion of the
Father and the Son; and on that account, perhaps, He is so called,
because the same name is suitable to both the Father and the Son. For He
Himself is called specially that which they are called in common;
because both the Father is a spirit and the Son a spirit, both the
Father is holy and the Son holy. <span id="fr_587"></span>[588](#fn_587)
In order, therefore, that the communion of both may be signified from a
name which is suitable to both, the Holy Spirit is called the gift of
both. And this Trinity is one God, alone, good, great, eternal,
omnipotent; itself its own unity, deity, greatness, goodness, eternity,
omnipotence.

<span id="iv.i.vii.xi-p8"></span> \[The reason which Augustin here
assigns, why the name Holy Spirit is given to the third person—namely,
because spirituality is a characteristic of both the Father and Son,
from both of whom he proceeds—is not that assigned in the more developed
trinitarianism. The explanation in this latter is, that the third person
is denominated the Spirit because of the peculiar manner in which the
divine essence is *communicated* to him—namely, by *spiration* or
out-breathing: *spiritus quia spiratus*. This is supported by the
etymological signification of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.vii.xi-p8.1"></span> πνεῦμα</span>, which is breath; and by the
symbolical action of Christ in [John
20.22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022)<span
id="iv.i.vii.xi-p8.2"></span>[John xx.
22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022)<span id="iv.i.vii.xi-p8.3"></span>,
which suggests the eternal spiration, or out-breathing of the third
person. The third trinitarian person is no more spiritual, in the sense
of immaterial, than the first and second persons, and if the term
“Spirit” is to be taken in this the ordinary signification, the
“trinitarian relation,” or personal peculiarity, as Augustin remarks,
“is not itself apparent in this name;” because it would mention nothing
distinctive of the third person, and not belonging to the first and
second. But taken technically to denote the spiration or out-breathing
by the Father and Son, the trinitarian peculiarity is apparent in the
name.

<span id="iv.i.vii.xi-p9"></span>And the epithet “Holy” is similarly
explained. The third person is the Holy Spirit, not because he is any
more holy than the first and second, but because he is the *source* and
*author* of holiness in all created spirits. This is eminently and
officially his work. In this way also, the epithet “Holy”—which in its
ordinary use would specify nothing peculiar to the third
person,—mentions a characteristic that differentiates him from the
Father and Son.—W.G.T.S.\]
