<span id="v.iv.xvi"></span>

<span id="v.iv.xvi-p1"></span> 15. Men are wont to move a question
concerning a third or fourth marriage, and even more numerous marriages
than this. On which to make answer strictly, I dare neither to condemn
any marriage, nor to take from these the shame of their great number.
But, lest the brevity of this my answer may chance to displease any, I
am prepared to listen to my reprover <span id="page_447">p. 447</span>
<span id="v.iv.xvi-Page_447"></span>treating more fully. For perhaps he
alleges some reason, why second marriages be not condemned, but third be
condemned. For I, as in the beginning of this discourse I gave warning,
dare not to be more wise than it behoveth to be wise. <span
id="fr_2253"></span>[2254](#fn_2253) For who am I, that I should think
that that must be defined which I see that the Apostle hath not defined?
For he saith, “A woman is bound, so long as her husband liveth.” <span
id="fr_2254"></span>[2255](#fn_2254) He said not, her first; or, second;
or, third; or, fourth; <span id="fr_2255"></span>[2256](#fn_2255) but,
“A woman,” saith he, “is bound, so long as her husband liveth; but if
her husband shall be dead, she is set free; let her be married to whom
she will, only in the Lord: but she shall be more blessed, if she shall
have so continued.” I know not what can be added to, or taken from, this
sentence, so far as relates to this matter. Next I hear Himself also,
the Master and Lord of the Apostles and of us, answering the Sadducees,
when they had proposed to Him a woman not once-married, or
twice-married, but, if it can be said, seven-married, <span
id="fr_2256"></span>[2257](#fn_2256) whose wife she should be in the
resurrection? For rebuking them, He saith, “Ye do err, not knowing the
Scriptures, nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they shall
neither be married, nor marry wives; <span
id="fr_2257"></span>[2258](#fn_2257) for they shall not begin to die,
but shall be equal to the Angels of God.” <span
id="fr_2258"></span>[2259](#fn_2258) Therefore He made mention of their
resurrection, who shall rise again unto life, not who shall rise again
unto punishment. Therefore He might have said, Ye do err, knowing not
the Scriptures, nor the power of God: for in that resurrection it will
not be possible that there be those that were wives of many; and then
added, that neither doth any there marry. But neither, as we see, did He
in this sentence show any sign of condemning her who was the wife of so
many husbands. Wherefore neither dare I, contrary to the feeling of
natural shame, say, that, when her husbands are dead, a woman marry as
often as she will; nor dare I, out of my own heart, beside the authority
of holy Scripture, condemn any number of marriages whatever. But, what I
say to a widow, who hath had one husband, this I say to every widow; you
will be more blessed, if you shall have so continued.
