<p class="c39"><a name="iv.ii.xlix-p1"></A>  <span class="c2"><a name="iv.ii.xlix-p1.1"></A>Chapter 47.&#8212;It is Difficult to Decide Whether the Sins of a Man&#146;s Other Progenitors are Imputed to Him.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.ii.xlix-p2"></A>But about the sins of the other progenitors who intervene between Adam and a man&#146;s own parents, a question may very well be raised. Whether every one who is born is involved in all their accumulated evil acts, in all their multiplied original guilt, so that the later he is born, so much the worse is his condition; or whether God threatens to visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generations, because in His mercy He does not extend His wrath against the sins of the progenitors further than that, lest those who do not obtain the grace of regeneration might be crushed down under too heavy a burden if they were compelled to bear as original guilt all the sins of all their progenitors from the very beginning of the human race, and to pay the penalty due to them; or whether any other solution of this great question may or may not be found in Scripture by a more diligent search and a more careful interpretation, I dare not rashly affirm.</p>
