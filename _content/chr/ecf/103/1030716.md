<span id="v.vi.xxviii-p1"></span> 27. There are some things of this sort
even of our Saviour in the Gospel, because the Lord of the Prophets
deigned to be Himself also a Prophet. Such are those where, concerning
the woman which had an issue of blood, He said, “Who touched Me?” <span
id="fr_2430"></span>[2431](#fn_2430) and of Lazarus. “Where have ye laid
him?” <span id="fr_2431"></span>[2432](#fn_2431) He asked, namely, as if
not knowing that which in any wise He knew. And He did on this account
feign that He knew not, that He might signify somewhat else by that His
seeming ignorance: and since this signification was truthful, it was
assuredly not a lie. For those were signified, whether by her which had
the issue, or by him which had been four days dead, whom even He Who
knew all things did in a certain sort know not. For both she bore the
type of the people of the Gentiles, whereof the prophecy had gone
before, “A people whom I have not known hath served Me:” <span
id="fr_2432"></span>[2433](#fn_2432) and Lazarus, removed from the
living, did as it were in that place lie in significative similitude
where He lay, Whose voice that is, “I am cast out of the sight of thine
eyes.” <span id="fr_2433"></span>[2434](#fn_2433) And with that intent,
as though it were not known by Christ, both who she was and where he was
laid, by His words of interrogating a figure was enacted and by truthful
signification all lying left apart.
