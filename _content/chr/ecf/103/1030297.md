id="iv.ii.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 47.—It is Difficult to Decide
Whether the Sins of a Man’s Other Progenitors are Imputed to Him.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xlix-p2"></span>But about the sins of the other
progenitors who intervene between Adam and a man’s own parents, a
question may very well be raised. Whether every one who is born is
involved in all their accumulated evil acts, in all their multiplied
original guilt, so that the later he is born, so much the worse is his
condition; or whether God threatens to visit the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children unto the third and fourth generations, because in His
mercy He does not extend His wrath against the sins of the progenitors
further than that, lest those who do not obtain the grace of
regeneration might be crushed down under too heavy a burden if they were
compelled to bear as original guilt all the sins of all their
progenitors from the very beginning of the human race, and to pay the
penalty due to them; or whether any other solution of this great
question may or may not be found in Scripture by a more diligent search
and a more careful interpretation, I dare not rashly affirm.
