<p class="c10"><a name="iv.ii.xii-p2"></A>By the Trinity, thus supremely and equally and unchangeably good, all things were created; and these are not supremely and equally and unchangeably good, but yet they are good, even taken separately. Taken as a whole, however, they are very good, because their <i>ensemble</i> constitutes the universe in all its wonderful order and beauty.</p>
