<span id="v.vi.xxxiv-p1"></span> 33. It remains then that we understand
as concerning those women, whether in Egypt or in Jericho, that for
their humanity and mercy they received a reward, in any wise temporal,
which indeed itself, while they wist not of it, should by prophetical
signification prefigure somewhat eternal. But whether it be ever right,
even for the saving of a man’s life, to tell a lie, as it is a question
in resolving which even the most learned do weary themselves, it did
vastly surpass the capacity of those poor women, set in the midst of
those nations, and accustomed to those manners. Therefore their
ignorance in this as well as in those other things of which they were
alike unknowing, but which are to be known by the children not of this
world but of that which is to come, the patience of God did bear withal:
Who yet, for their human kindness which they had shown to His servants,
rendered unto them rewards of an earthly sort, albeit signifying
somewhat of an heavenly. And Rahab, indeed, delivered out of Jericho,
made transition into the people of God, where, being proficient, she
might attain to eternal and immortal prizes which are not to be sought
by any lie. Yet at that time when she did for the Israelite spies that
good, and, for her condition of life, laudable work, she was not as yet
such that it should be required of her, “In your mouth let Yea be yea,
Nay nay.” <span id="fr_2447"></span>[2448](#fn_2447) But as for those
midwives, albeit Hebrewesses, if they savored only after the flesh, what
or how great is the good they got of their temporal reward in that they
made them houses, unless by making proficiency they attained unto that
house of which is sung unto God, “Blessed are they that dwell in thine
house; for ever and ever they will praise thee?” <span
id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448) It must be confessed, however, that
it approacheth much unto righteousness, and though not yet in reality,
even now in respect of hopefulness and disposition that mind is to be
praised, which never lies except with intention and will to do good to
some man, but to hurt no man. But as for us, when we ask whether it be
the part of a good man sometimes to lie, we ask not concerning a person
pertaining to Egypt, or to Jericho, or to Babylon, or still to Jerusalem
itself, the earthly, which is in bondage with her children; <span
id="fr_2449"></span>[2450](#fn_2449) but concerning a citizen of that
city which is above and free, our mother, eternal in the heavens. And to
our asking it is answered, “No lie is of the truth.” <span
id="fr_2450"></span>[2451](#fn_2450) The sons of that city, are sons of
the Truth. That city’s sons are they of whom it is written,“In their
mouth was found no lie:” <span id="fr_2451"></span>[2452](#fn_2451) son
of that city is he of whom is also written, “A son receiving the word
shall be far from destruction: but receiving, he hath received that for
himself, and nothing false proceedeth out of his mouth.” <span
id="fr_2452"></span>[2453](#fn_2452) These sons of Jerusalem on high,
and of the holy city eternal, if ever, as they be men, a lie of what
kind soever doth worm itself into them, they ask humbly for pardon, not
therefrom seek moreover glory.
