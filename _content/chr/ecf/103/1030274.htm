Following upon this crept in, and now even in opposition to man&#146;s will, <i>ignorance</i> of duty, and <i>lust</i> after what is hurtful: and these brought in their train <i>error</i> and <i> suffering</i>, which, when they are felt to be imminent, produce that shrinking of the mind which is called <i>fear</i>. Further, when the mind attains the objects of its desire, however hurtful or empty they may be, error prevents it from perceiving their true nature, or its perceptions are overborne by a diseased appetite, and so it is puffed up with a <i>foolish joy</i>. From these fountains of evil, which spring out of defect rather than superfluity, flows every form of misery that besets a rational nature.</p>
