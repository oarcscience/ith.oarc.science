<span id="v.iii.xl"></span>

<span id="v.iii.xl-p1"></span> 39. I fear, I say, greatly for thee,
lest, when thou boastest that thou wilt follow the Lamb wheresoever He
shall have gone, thou be unable by reason of swelling pride to follow
Him through strait ways. It is good for thee, O virgin soul, that thus,
as thou art a virgin, thus altogether keeping in thy heart that thou
hast been born again, keeping in thy flesh that thou hast been born,
thou yet conceive of the fear of the Lord, and give birth to the spirit
of salvation. <span id="fr_2141"></span>[2142](#fn_2141) “Fear,” indeed,
“there is not in charity, but perfect charity,” as it is written,
“casteth out fear:” <span id="fr_2142"></span>[2143](#fn_2142) but fear
of men, not of God: fear of temporal evils, not of the Divine Judgment
at the last. “Be not thou high-minded, but fear.” <span
id="fr_2143"></span>[2144](#fn_2143) Love thou the goodness of God; fear
thou His severity: neither suffers thee to be proud. For by loving you
fear, lest you grievously offend One Who is loved and loves. For what
more grievous offense, than that by pride thou displease Him, Who for
thy sake hath been displeasing to the proud? And where ought there to be
more that “chaste fear abiding for ever and ever,” <span
id="fr_2144"></span>[2145](#fn_2144) than in thee, who hast no thought
of the things of this world, how to please a wedded partner; but of the
things of the Lord, how to please the Lord? <span
id="fr_2145"></span>[2146](#fn_2145) That other fear is not in charity,
but this chaste fear quitteth not charity. If you love not, fear lest
you perish; if you love, fear lest you displease. That fear charity
casteth out, with this it runneth within. The Apostle Paul also says,
“For we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but we
have received the spirit of adoption of sons, wherein we cry, Abba,
Father.” <span id="fr_2146"></span>[2147](#fn_2146) I believe that he
speaks of that fear, which had been given in the Old Testament, lest the
temporal goods should be lost, which God had promised unto those not yet
sons under grace, but as yet slaves under the law. There is also the
fear of eternal fire, to serve God in order to avoid which is assuredly
not yet of perfect charity. For the desire of the reward is one thing,
the fear of punishment another. They are different sayings, “Whither
shall I go away from Thy Spirit, and from Thy face whither shall I
flee?” <span id="fr_2147"></span>[2148](#fn_2147) and, “One thing I have
sought of the Lord, this I will seek after; that I may dwell in the
house of the Lord through all the days of my life, that I may consider
the delight of the Lord, that I be protected in His temple:” <span
id="fr_2148"></span>[2149](#fn_2148) and, “Turn not away Thy face from
me:” <span id="fr_2149"></span>[2150](#fn_2149) and, “My soul longeth
and fainteth unto the courts of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_2150"></span>[2151](#fn_2150) Those sayings let him have had, who
dared not to lift up his eyes to heaven; and she who was watering with
tears His feet, in order to obtain pardon for her grievous sins; but
these do thou have, who art careful about the things of the Lord, to be
holy both in body and spirit. With those sayings there companies fear
which hath torment, which <span id="page_432">p. 432</span> <span
id="v.iii.xl-Page_432"></span>perfect charity casteth forth; but with
these sayings there companies chaste fear of the Lord, that abideth for
ever and ever. And to both kinds it must be said, “Be not thou
high-minded, but fear;” <span id="fr_2151"></span>[2152](#fn_2151) that
man neither of defense of his sins, nor of presumption of righteousness
set himself up. For Paul also himself, who saith, “For ye have not
received the spirit of bondage again to fear;” <span
id="fr_2152"></span>[2153](#fn_2152) yet, fear being a companion of
charity, saith, “With fear and much trembling was I towards you:” <span
id="fr_2153"></span>[2154](#fn_2153) and that saying, which I have
mentioned, that the engrafted wild olive tree be not proud against the
broken branches of the olive tree, himself made use of, saying, “Be not
thou high-minded, but fear;” himself admonishing all the members of
Christ in general, saith, “With fear and trembling work out your own
salvation; for it is God Who worketh in you both to will and to do,
according to His good pleasure;” <span
id="fr_2154"></span>[2155](#fn_2154) that it seem not to pertain unto
the Old Testament what is written, “Serve the Lord in fear, and rejoice
unto Him with trembling.” <span id="fr_2155"></span>[2156](#fn_2155)
