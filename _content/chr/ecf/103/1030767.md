<span id="v.vii.xxxvi-p1"></span> 35. And that which follows concerning
birds of the air and lilies of the field, He saith to this end, that no
man may think that God careth not for the needs of His servants; when
His most wise Providence reacheth unto these in creating and governing
those. For it must not be deemed that it is not He that feeds and
clothes them also which work with their hands. But lest they turn aside
the Christian service of warfare unto their purpose of getting these
things, the Lord in this premonisheth His servants that in this ministry
which is due to His Sacrament, we should take thought, not for these,
but for His kingdom and righteousness: and all these things shall be
added unto us, whether working by our hands, or whether by infirmity of
body hindered from working, or whether bound by such occupation of our
very warfare that we are able to do nothing else. For neither does it
follow that because the Lord hath said, “Call upon Me in the day of
tribulation and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me,” <span
id="fr_2586"></span>[2587](#fn_2586) therefore the Apostle ought not to
have fled, and to be let down by the wall in a basket that he might
escape the hands of a pursuer, <span
id="fr_2587"></span>[2588](#fn_2587) but should rather have waited to be
taken, that, like the three children from the midst of the fires, the
Lord might deliver him. Or for this reason ought not the Lord either to
have said this, “If they shall persecute you in one city, flee ye to
another,” <span id="fr_2588"></span>[2589](#fn_2588) namely, because He
hath said, “If ye shall ask of the Father any thing in My name, He will
give it you.” <span id="fr_2589"></span>[2590](#fn_2589) As then whoever
to Christ’s disciples when fleeing from persecution should cast up this
sort of question, why they did not rather stand, and by calling upon God
obtain through His marvellous works in such wise deliverance, as Daniel
from the lions, as Peter from his chains, they would answer that they
ought not to tempt God, but He would then and then only do the like for
them, if it should please Him, when they had nothing that they could do;
but when He put flight in their power, although they were thereby
delivered, yet were they not delivered but by Him: so likewise to
servants of God having time and strength after the example and precept
of the Apostle to get their living by their own hands, if any from the
Gospel shall raise a question concerning the birds of the air, which sow
not nor reap nor gather into stores, and concerning lilies of the field
that they toil not neither do they spin; they will easily answer, “If we
also, by reason of any either infirmity or occupation cannot work, He
will so feed and clothe us, as He doth the birds and the lilies, which
do no work of this kind: <span id="page_521">p. 521</span> <span
id="v.vii.xxxvi-Page_521"></span>but when we are able, we ought not to
tempt our God; because this very ability of ours, we have it by His
gift, and in living by it, we live by His bounty Who hath bounteously
bestowed upon us that we should have this ability. And therefore
concerning these necessary things we are not solicitous; because when we
are able to do these things, He by Whom mankind are fed and clothed doth
feed and clothe us: but when we are not able to do these things, He
feeds and clothes us by Whom the birds are fed and the lilies clothed,
because we are more worth than they. Wherefore in this our warfare,
neither for the morrow take we thought: because not for the sake of
these temporal things, whereunto pertaineth To-morrow, but for the sake
of those eternal things, where it is evermore To-day, have we proved
ourselves unto Him, that, entangled in no secular business, we may
please Him. <span id="fr_2590"></span>[2591](#fn_2590)
