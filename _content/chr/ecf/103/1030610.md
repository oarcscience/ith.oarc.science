<span id="v.iii.lvii-p1"></span> 56. It is well that He seeks your
beauty within, where He hath given unto you power to become daughters of
God: <span id="fr_2217"></span>[2218](#fn_2217) He seeks not of you a
fair flesh, but fair conduct, whereby to bridle also the flesh. He is
not one unto Whom any one can lie concerning you, and make him rage
through jealousy. See with how great security ye love Him, Whom ye fear
not to offend by false suspicions. Husband and wife love each other, in
that they see each other: and what they see not, that they fear between
themselves: nor have they sure delight in what is visible, while in what
is concealed they usually suspect what is not. Ye in Him, Whom ye see
not with the eyes, and behold by faith, neither have what is real to
blame, nor fear lest haply ye offend Him by what is false. If therefore
ye should owe great love to husbands, Him, for Whose sake ye would not
have husbands, how greatly ought ye to love? Let Him be fixed in your
whole heart, Who for you was fixed on the Cross: let Him possess in your
soul all that, whatever it be, that ye would not have occupied by
marriage. It is not lawful for you to love little Him, for Whose sake ye
have not loved even what were lawful. So loving Him Who is meek and
lowly of heart, I have no fear for you of pride.
