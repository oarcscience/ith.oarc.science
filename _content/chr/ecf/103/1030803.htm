<p class="c52"><a name="v.ix.i-p1"></A> <i>From the Retractations</i>, Book ii. Chap. 64.</p>  
<p class="c49"><a name="v.ix.i-p2"></A>The book, <i>On care to be had for the dead</i>, I wrote, having been asked by letter whether it profits any person after death that his body shall be buried at the memorial of any Saint.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2706"></A><A HREF="#fn_2706"><FONT SIZE="1">2707</FONT></A>
 The book begins thus: <i>Long time unto your Holiness, my venerable fellow-bishop Paulinus</i>.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="v.ix.i-p3"></A> The date may be conjectured from the order of the <i>Retractations</i>, where this book is mentioned next after the <i>Enchiridion ad Laurentium</i>, which was not finished earlier than A.D. 421. The first two paragraphs of this treatise will be found quoted by Augustin in his Book <i>On Eight Questions of Dulcitius</i>, Qu&aelig;st. ii. 2, 3. <i>Ben. ed.</i> Paulinus, to whom it was addressed, was Bishop of Nol&aelig;, and took great pains to honor the memory of St. Felix, who is mentioned in the beginning of it. Several poems of his on the subject are extant.</p>
