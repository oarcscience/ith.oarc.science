<span id="iv.ii.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36.—The Grace of God is Clearly
and Remarkably Displayed in Raising the Man Christ Jesus to the Dignity
of the Son of God.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxxviii-p2"></span>Now here the grace of God is
displayed with the greatest power and clearness. For what merit had the
human nature in the man Christ earned, that it should in this
unparalleled way be taken up into the unity of the person of the only
Son of God? What goodness of will, what goodness of desire and
intention, what good works, had gone before, which made this man worthy
to become one person with God? Had He been a man previously to this, and
had He earned this unprecedented reward, that He should be thought
worthy to become God? Assuredly <span id="page_250">p. 250</span> <span
id="iv.ii.xxxviii-Page_250"></span>nay; from the very moment that He
began to be man, He was nothing else than the Son of God, the only Son
of God, the Word who was made flesh, and therefore He was God so that
just as each individual man unites in one person a body and a rational
soul, so Christ in one person unites the Word and man. Now wherefore was
this unheard of glory conferred on human nature,—a glory which, as there
was no antecedent merit, was of course wholly of grace,—except that here
those who looked at the matter soberly and honestly might behold a clear
manifestation of the power of God’s free grace, and might understand
that they are justified from their sins by the same grace which made the
man Christ Jesus free from the possibility of sin? And so the angel,
when he announced to Christ’s mother the coming birth, saluted her thus:
“Hail, thou that art full of grace;” <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150) and shortly afterwards, “Thou hast
found grace with God.” <span id="fr_1151"></span>[1152](#fn_1151) Now
she was said to be full of grace, and to have found grace with God,
because she was to be the mother of her Lord, nay, of the Lord of all
flesh. But, speaking of Christ Himself, the evangelist John, after
saying, “The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,” adds, “and we
beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full
of grace and truth.” <span id="fr_1152"></span>[1153](#fn_1152) When he
says, “The Word was made flesh,” this is “full of grace;” when he says,
“the glory of the only-begotten of the Father,” this is “full of truth.”
For the Truth Himself, who was the only-begotten of the Father, not by
grace, but by nature, by grace took our humanity upon Him, and so united
it with His own person that He Himself became also the Son of man.
