<span id="iv.ii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—There Can Be No Evil Where There
is No Good; And an Evil Man is an Evil Good.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xv-p2"></span>Accordingly, there is nothing of what we
call evil, if there be nothing good. But a good which is wholly without
evil is a perfect good. A good, on the other hand, which contains evil
is a faulty or imperfect good; and there can be no evil where there is
no good. From all this we arrive at the curious result: that since every
being, so far as it is a being, is good, when we say that a faulty being
is an evil being, we just seem to say that what is good is evil, and
that nothing but what is good can be evil, seeing that every being is
good, and that no evil can exist except in a being. Nothing, then, can
be evil except something which is good. And although this, when stated,
seems to be a contradiction, yet the strictness of reasoning leaves us
no escape from the conclusion. We must, however, beware of incurring the
prophetic condemnation: “Woe unto them that call evil good, and good
evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put
bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.” <span
id="fr_1103"></span>[1104](#fn_1103) And yet our Lord says: “An evil man
out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is
evil.” <span id="fr_1104"></span>[1105](#fn_1104) Now, what is evil man
but an evil being? for a man is a being. Now, if a man is a good thing
because he is a being, what is an evil man but an evil good? Yet, when
we accurately distinguish these two things, we find that it is not
because he is a man that he is an evil, or because he is wicked that he
is a good; but that he is a good because he is a man, and an evil
because he is wicked. Whoever, then, says, “To be a man is an evil,” or,
“To be wicked is a good,” falls under the prophetic denunciation: “Woe
unto them that call evil good, and good evil!” For he condemns the work
of God, which is the man, and praises the defect of man, which is the
wickedness. Therefore every being, even if it be a defective one, in so
far as it is a being is good, and in so far as it is defective is evil.
