<span id="v.iii.xv-p1"></span> 14. It is, therefore, the present
necessity that we are to avoid, but yet such as is a hindrance to
somewhat of the good things to come; by which necessity the married life
is forced to have thought of the things of the world, how to please, the
husband the wife or the wife the husband. Not that these separate from
the kingdom of God, as there are sins, which are restrained by command,
not by counsel, on this account, because it is matter of condemnation
not to obey the Lord when He commands: but that, which, within the
kingdom of God itself, might be more largely possessed, if there were
larger thoughts how they were to please God, will assuredly be less,
when as this very thing is less thought of by necessity of marriage.
Therefore he says, “Concerning virgins I have not command of the
Lord.” <span id="fr_2046"></span>[2047](#fn_2046) For whosoever obeys
not a command, is guilty and liable for punishment. Wherefore, because
it is not sin to marry a wife or to be married, (but if it were a sin,
it would be forbidden by a “Command,”) on this account there is no
“Command” of the Lord concerning virgins. But since, after we have
shunned or had forgiveness of sins, we must approach eternal life,
wherein is a certain or more excellent glory, to be assigned not unto
all who shall live for ever, but unto certain there; in order to obtain
which it is not enough to have been set free from sins, unless there be
vowed unto Him, Who setteth us free, something, which it is no matter of
fault not to have vowed, but matter of praise to have vowed and
performed; he saith, “I give counsel, as having obtained mercy from God
that I should be faithful.” For neither ought I to grudge faithful
counsel, who not by my own merits, but by the mercy of God, am faithful.
“I think therefore that this is good, by reason of the present
necessity.” <span id="fr_2047"></span>[2048](#fn_2047) This, saith he,
on which I have not command of the Lord, but give counsel, that is
concerning virgins, I think to be good by reason of the present
necessity. For I know what the necessity of the present time, unto which
marriages serve, compels, that the things of God be less thought of than
is enough for the obtaining that glory, which shall not be of all,
although they abide in eternal life and salvation: “For star differeth
from star in brightness; so also the Resurrection of the dead. <span
id="fr_2048"></span>[2049](#fn_2048) It is,” therefore, “good for a man
so to be.”
