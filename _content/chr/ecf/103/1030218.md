<span id="iv.i.xvi.xix"></span>

<span id="iv.i.xvi.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.xvi.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—John is Rather to Be
Understood of Our Perfect Likeness with the Trinity in Life Eternal.
Wisdom is Perfected in Happiness.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xvi.xix-p2"></span>25. But in respect to that image
indeed, of which it is said, “Let us make man after our image and
likeness,” <span id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927) we believe,—and,
after the utmost search we have been able to make, understand,—that man
was made after the image of the Trinity, because it is not said, After
my, or After thy image. And therefore that place too of the Apostle John
must be understood rather according to this image, when he says, “We
shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is;” because he spoke too
of Him of whom he had said, “We are the sons of God.” <span
id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928) And the immortality of the flesh will
be perfected in that moment of the resurrection, of which the Apostle
Paul says, “In the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; and the dead
shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.” <span
id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929) For in that very twinkling of an eye,
before the judgment, the spiritual body shall rise again in power, in
incorruption, in glory, which is now sown a natural body in weakness, in
corruption, in dishonor. But the image which is renewed in the spirit of
the mind in the knowledge of God, not outwardly, but inwardly, from day
to day, shall be perfected by that sight itself; which then after the
judgment shall be face to face, but now makes progress as through a
glass in an enigma. <span id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930) And we must
understand it to be said on account of this perfection, that “we shall
be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.” For this gift will be given
to us at that time, when it shall have been said, “Come, ye blessed of
my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you.” <span
id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931) For then will the ungodly be taken
away, so that he shall not see the glory of the Lord, <span
id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932) when those on the left hand shall go
into eternal punishment, while those on the right go into life
eternal. <span id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933) But “this is eternal
life,” as the Truth tells us; “to know Thee,” He says, “the one true
God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.” <span
id="fr_934"></span>[935](#fn_934)

<span id="iv.i.xvi.xix-p11"></span>26. This contemplative wisdom, which
I believe is properly called wisdom as distinct from knowledge in the
sacred writings; but wisdom only of man, which yet man has not except
from Him, by partaking of whom a rational and intellectual mind can be
made truly wise;—this contemplative wisdom, I say, it is that Cicero
commends, in the end of the dialogue *Hortensius*, when he says: “While,
then, we consider these things night and day, and sharpen our
understanding, which is the eye of the mind, taking care that it be not
ever dulled, that is, while we live in philosophy; we, I say, in so
doing, have great hope that, if, on the one hand, this sentiment and
wisdom of ours is mortal and perishable, we shall still, when we have
discharged our human offices, have a pleasant setting, and a not painful
extinction, and as it were a rest from life: or if, on the other, as
ancient philosophers thought,—and those, too, the greatest and far the
most celebrated,—we have souls eternal and divine, then must we needs
think, that the more these shall have always kept in their own proper
course, *i.e.* in reason and in the desire of inquiry, and the less they
shall have mixed and entangled themselves in the vices and errors of
men, the more easy ascent and return they will have to heaven.” And then
he says, adding this short sentence, and finishing his discourse by
repeating it: “Wherefore, to end my discourse at last, if we wish either
for a tranquil extinction, after living in the pursuit of these
subjects, or if to migrate without delay from this present home to
another in no little measure better, we must bestow all our labor and
care upon these pursuits.” And here I marvel, that a man of such great
ability should promise to men living in philosophy, which makes man
blessed by contemplation of truth, “a pleasant setting after the
discharge of human offices, if this our sentiment and wisdom is mortal
and perishable;” as if that which we did not love, or rather which we
fiercely hated, were then to die and come to nothing, so that its
setting would be pleasant to us! But indeed he had not learned this from
the philosophers, whom he extols with great praise; but this sentiment
is redolent of that New Academy, wherein it pleased him to doubt of even
<span id="page_198">p. 198</span> <span
id="iv.i.xvi.xix-Page_198"></span>the plainest things. But from the
philosophers that were greatest and far most celebrated, as he himself
confesses, he had learned that souls are eternal. For souls that are
eternal are not unsuitably stirred up by the exhortation to be found in
“their own proper course,” when the end of this life shall have come,
*i.e.* “in reason and in the desire of inquiry,” and to mix and entangle
themselves the less in the vices and errors of men, in order that they
may have an easier return to God. But that course which consists in the
love and investigation of truth does not suffice for the wretched,
*i.e.* for all mortals who have only this kind of reason, and are
without faith in the Mediator; as I have taken pains to prove, as much
as I could, in former books of this work, especially in the fourth and
thirteenth.
