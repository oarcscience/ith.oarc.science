<p class="c10"><a name="v.iii.xlv-p1"></A>  44. Next let not man, now that he knoweth that by the grace of God he is what he is, fall into another snare of pride, so as by lifting up himself for the very grace of God to despise the rest. By which fault that other Pharisee both gave thanks unto God for the goods which he had, and yet vaunted himself above the Publican confessing his sins. What therefore should a virgin do, what should she think, that she vaunt not herself above those, men or women, who have not this so great gift? For she ought not to feign humility, <A NAME="page_434"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 434</FONT></A> <a name="v.iii.xlv-Page_434"></A>but to set it forth: for the feigning of humility is greater pride. Wherefore Scripture wishing to show that humility ought to be true, after having said, &#8220;By how much thou art great, by so much humble thyself in all things,&#8221; added soon after, &#8220;And thou shalt find grace before God:&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2184"></A><A HREF="#fn_2184"><FONT SIZE="1">2185</FONT></A>
 assuredly where one could not humble one&#146;s self deceitfully.</p>
