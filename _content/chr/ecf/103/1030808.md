<span id="v.ix.vi-p1"></span> 5. Yet it follows not that the bodies of
the departed are to be despised and flung aside, and above all of just
and faithful men, which bodies as organs and vessels to all good works
their spirit hath holily used. For if a father’s garment and ring, and
whatever such like, is the more dear to those whom they leave behind,
the greater their affection is towards their parents, in no wise are the
bodies themselves to be spurned, which truly we wear in more familiar
and close conjunction than any of our putting on. For these pertain not
to ornament or aid which is applied from without, but to the very nature
of man. Whence also the funerals of the just men of old were with
dutiful piety cared for, and their obsequies celebrated, and sepulture
provided: <span id="fr_2720"></span>[2721](#fn_2720) and themselves
while living did touching burial or even translation of their bodies
give charge to their sons. Tobias also, to have by burying of the dead
obtained favor with God, is by witness of an Angel commended. <span
id="fr_2721"></span>[2722](#fn_2721) The Lord Himself also, about to
rise on the third day, both preaches, and commends to be preached, the
good work of a religious woman, that she poured out a precious ointment
over His limbs, and did it for His burial: <span
id="fr_2722"></span>[2723](#fn_2722) and they are with praise
commemorated in the Gospel, who having received His Body from the cross
did carefully and with reverend honor see it wound and laid in the
sepulchre. <span id="fr_2723"></span>[2724](#fn_2723) These authorities
however do not put us upon thinking that there is in dead bodies any
feeling; but rather, that the Providence of God (Who is moreover pleased
with such offices of piety) doth charge itself with the bodies also of
the dead, this they betoken, to the intent our faith of resurrection
might be stayed up thereby. Where also is wholesomely learned, how great
may be the reward for alms which we do unto the living and feeling, if
not even that be lost before God, whatever of duty and of diligence is
paid to the lifeless members of men. There are indeed also other things,
which in speaking of the bestowal or removal of their bodies the holy
Patriarchs willed to be understood as spoken by the prophetic Spirit:
but this is not the place to treat thoroughly of these things, seeing
that sufficeth which we have said. But if the lack of those things which
are necessary for sustentation of the living, as food and clothing,
however heavy affliction attend the lacking, do not break in good men
the manly courage of bearing and enduring, nor eradicate piety from the
mind, but by exercising make it more fruitful; how much more doth lack
of those things which are wont to be applied for care of funerals and
bestowal of bodies of the departed, not make them wretched, now that in
the hidden abodes of the pious they are at rest! And therefore, when
these things have to dead bodies of Christians in that devastation of
the great City or of other towns also been lacking, there is neither
fault of the living, who could not afford these things, nor pain of the
dead who could not feel the same. <span
id="fr_2724"></span>[2725](#fn_2724) This is my opinion concerning the
ground and reason of sepulture. Which I have therefore from another book
of mine transferred to this, because it was easier to rehearse this,
than to express the same matter in another way.
