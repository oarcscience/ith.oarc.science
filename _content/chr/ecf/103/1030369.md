id="iv.ii.cxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 119.—The Grace of Regeneration
Washes Away All Past Sin and All Original Guilt.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.cxxi-p2"></span>Now in whichever of these four stages
(as we may call them) the grace of regeneration finds any particular
man, all his past sins are there and then pardoned, and the guilt which
he contracted in his birth is removed in his new birth; and so true is
it that “the wind bloweth where it listeth,” <span
id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321) that some have never known the
second stage, that of slavery under the law, but have received the
divine assistance as soon as they received the commandment.
