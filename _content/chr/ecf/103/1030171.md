Continued.</span>

<span id="iv.i.xiv.ix-p2"></span>14. For the soul loving its own power,
slips onwards from the whole which is common, to a part, which belongs
especially to itself. And that apostatizing pride, which is called “the
beginning of sin,” <span id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765) whereas it
might have been most excellently governed by the laws of God, if it had
followed Him as its ruler in the universal creature, by seeking
something more than the whole, and struggling to govern this by a law of
its own, is thrust on, since nothing is more than the whole, into caring
for a part; and thus by lusting after something more, is made less;
whence also covetousness is called “the root of all evil.” <span
id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766) And it administers that whole, wherein
it strives to do something of its own against the laws by which the
whole is governed, by its own body, which it possesses only in part; and
so being delighted by corporeal forms and motions, because it has not
the things themselves within itself, and because it is wrapped up in
their images, which it has fixed in the memory, and is foully polluted
by fornication of the phantasy, while it refers all its functions to
those ends, for which it curiously seeks corporeal and temporal things
through the senses of the body, either it affects with swelling
arrogance to be more excellent than other souls that are given up to the
corporeal senses, or it is plunged into a foul whirlpool of carnal
pleasure.
