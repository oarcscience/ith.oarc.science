<span id="iv.vi.xxxiii-p1"></span> 32. But if they say that we are not
even to believe in Christ, unless undoubted reason shall be given us,
they are not Christians. For this is what certain pagans say against us,
foolishly indeed, yet not contrary to, or inconsistent with, themselves.
But who can endure that these profess to belong to Christ, <span
id="page_363">p. 363</span> <span id="iv.vi.xxxiii-Page_363"></span>who
contend that they are to believe nothing, unless they shall bring
forward to fools most open reason concerning God? But we see that He
Himself, so far as that history, which they themselves believe, teaches,
willed nothing before, or more strongly than, that He should be believed
in: whereas they, with whom He had to do, were not yet qualified to
receive the secret things of God. For, for what other purpose are so
great and so many miracles, He Himself also saying, that they are done
for no other cause, than that He may be believed in? He used to lead
fools by faith, you lead by reason. He used to cry out, that He should
be believed in, ye cry out against it. He used to praise such as believe
in Him, ye blame them. But unless either He should change water into
wine, <span id="fr_1749"></span>[1750](#fn_1749) to omit other
(miracles), if men would follow Him, doing no such, but (only) teaching;
either we must make no account of that saying, “Believe ye God, believe
also Me;” <span id="fr_1750"></span>[1751](#fn_1750) or we must charge
him with rashness, who willed not that He should come into his house,
believing that the disease of his servant would depart at His mere
command. <span id="fr_1751"></span>[1752](#fn_1751) Therefore He
bringing to us a medicine such as should heal our utterly corrupt
manners, by miracles procured to Himself authority, <span
id="fr_1752"></span>[1753](#fn_1752) by authority obtained Himself
belief, by belief drew together a multitude, by a multitude possessed
antiquity, by antiquity strengthened religion: so that not only the
utterly foolish novelty of heretics dealing deceitfully, but also the
inveterate error of the nations opposing with violence, should be unable
on any side to rend it asunder.
