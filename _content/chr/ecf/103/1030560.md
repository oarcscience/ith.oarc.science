<span id="v.iii.vii-p1"></span> 6. And on this account, that one female,
not only in the Spirit, but also in the flesh, is both a mother and a
virgin. And a mother indeed in the Spirit, not of our Head, Which is the
Saviour Himself, of Whom rather she was born after the Spirit: forasmuch
as all, who <span id="page_419">p. 419</span> <span
id="v.iii.vii-Page_419"></span>have believed in Him, among whom is
herself also, are rightly called “children of the Bridegroom:” <span
id="fr_2032"></span>[2033](#fn_2032) but clearly the mother of His
members, which are we: in that she wrought together by charity, that
faithful ones should be born in the Church, who are members of That
Head: but in the flesh, the mother of the Head Himself. For it behoved
that our Head, on account of a notable miracle, should be born after the
flesh of a virgin, that He might thereby signify that His members would
be born after the Spirit, of the Church a virgin: therefore Mary alone
both in Spirit and in flesh is a mother and a virgin: both the mother of
Christ, and a virgin of Christ; but the Church, in the Saints who shall
possess the kingdom of God, in the Spirit indeed is altogether the
mother of Christ, altogether a virgin of Christ: but in the flesh not
altogether, but in certain a virgin of Christ, in certain a mother, but
not of Christ. Forsooth both faithful women who are married, and virgins
dedicated to God, by holy manners, and charity out of a pure
heart, <span id="fr_2033"></span>[2034](#fn_2033) and good conscience,
and faith unfeigned, because they do the will of the Father, are after a
spiritual sense mothers of Christ. But they who in married life give
birth to (children) after the flesh, give birth not to Christ, but to
Adam, and therefore run, that their offspring having been dyed <span
id="fr_2034"></span>[2035](#fn_2034) in His Sacraments, may become
members of Christ, forasmuch as they know what they have given birth to.
