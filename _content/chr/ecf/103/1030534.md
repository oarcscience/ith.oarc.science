<span id="v.ii.xviii-p1"></span> 17. That marriage can take place of
persons first ill joined, an honest decree following after, is manifest.
But a marriage once for all entered upon in the City of our God, where,
even from the first union of the two, the man and the woman, marriage
bears a certain sacramental character, can no way be dissolved but by
the death of one of them. For the bond of marriage remains, although a
family, for the sake of which it was entered upon, do not follow through
manifest barrenness; so that, when now married persons know that they
shall not have children, yet it is not lawful for them to separate even
for the very sake of children, and to join themselves unto others. And
if they shall so do, they commit adultery with those unto whom they join
themselves, but themselves remain husbands and wives. Clearly with the
good will of the wife to take another woman, that from her may be born
sons common to both, by the sexual intercourse and seed of the one, but
by the right and power of the other, was lawful among the ancient
fathers: whether it be lawful now also, I would not hastily pronounce.
For there is not now necessity of begetting children, as there then was,
when, even when wives bare children, it was allowed, in order to a more
numerous posterity, to marry other wives in addition, which now is
certainly not lawful. For the difference that separates times causes the
due season to have so great force unto the justice and doing or not
doing any thing, that now a man does better, if he marry not even one
wife, unless he be unable to contain. But then they married even several
without any blame, even <span id="page_407">p. 407</span> <span
id="v.ii.xviii-Page_407"></span>those who could much more easily
contain, were it not that piety at that time had another demand upon
them. For, as the wise and just man, <span
id="fr_1981"></span>[1982](#fn_1981) who now desires to be dissolved and
to be with Christ, and takes more pleasure in this, the best, now not
from desire of living here, but from duty of being useful <span
id="fr_1982"></span>[1983](#fn_1982) , takes food that he may remain in
the flesh, which is necessary for the sake of others; so to have
intercourse with females in right of marriage, was to holy men at that
time a matter of duty not of lust.
