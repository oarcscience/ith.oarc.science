<span id="iv.ii.cxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.cxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 118.—The Four Stages of the
Christian’s Life, and the Four Corresponding Stages of the Church’s
History.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.cxx-p2"></span>When, sunk in the darkest depths of
ignorance, man lives according to the flesh undisturbed by any struggle
of reason or conscience, this is his first state. Afterwards, when
through the law has come the knowledge of sin, and the Spirit of God has
not yet interposed His aid, man, striving to live according to the law,
is thwarted in his efforts and falls into conscious sin, and so, being
overcome of sin, becomes its slave (“for of whom a man is overcome, of
the same is he brought in bondage” <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318) ); and thus the effect produced by
the knowledge of the commandment is this, that sin worketh in man all
manner of concupiscence, and he is involved in the additional guilt of
willful transgression, and that is fulfilled which is written: “The, law
entered that the offense might abound.” <span
id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319) This is man’s second state. But if
God has regard to him, and inspires him with faith in God’s help, and
the Spirit of God begins to work in him, then the mightier power of love
strives against the power of the flesh; and although there is still in
the man’s own nature a power that fights against him (for his disease is
not completely cured), yet he lives the life of the just by faith, and
lives in righteousness so far as he does not yield to evil lust, but
conquers it by the love of holiness. This is the third state of a man of
good hope; and he who by steadfast piety advances in this course, shall
attain at last to peace, that peace which, after this life is over,
shall be perfected in the repose of the spirit, and finally in the
resurrection of the body. Of these four different stages the first is
before the law, the second is under the law, the third is under grace,
and the fourth is in full and perfect peace. Thus, too, has the history
of God’s people been ordered according to His pleasure who disposeth all
things in number, and measure, and weight. <span
id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320) For the church existed at first
before the law; then under the law, which was given by Moses; then under
grace, which was first made manifest in the coming of the Mediator. Not,
indeed, that this grace was absent previously, but, in harmony with the
arrangements of the time, it was veiled and hidden. For none, even of
the just men of old, could find salvation apart from the faith of
Christ; nor unless He had been known to them could their ministry have
been used to convey prophecies concerning Him to us, some more plain,
and some more obscure.
