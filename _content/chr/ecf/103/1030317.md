<span id="iv.ii.lxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 67.—Faith Without Works is Dead, and
Cannot Save a Man.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxix-p2"></span>It is believed, moreover, by some, that
men who do not abandon the name of Christ, and who have been baptized in
the Church by His baptism, and who have never been cut off from the
Church by any schism or heresy, though they should live in the grossest
sin and never either wash it away in penitence nor redeem it by
almsgiving, but persevere in it persistently to the last day of their
lives, shall be saved by fire; that is, that although they shall suffer
a punishment by fire, lasting for a time proportionate to the magnitude
of their crimes and misdeeds, they shall not be punished with
everlasting fire. But those who believe this, and yet are Catholics,
seem to me to be led astray by a kind of benevolent feeling natural to
humanity. For Holy Scripture, when consulted, gives a very different
answer. I have written a book on this subject, entitled *Of Faith and
Works*, in which, to the best of my ability, God assisting me, I have
shown from Scripture, that the faith which saves us is that which the
Apostle Paul clearly enough describes when he says: “For in Jesus Christ
neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith
which worketh by love.” <span id="fr_1215"></span>[1216](#fn_1215) But
if it worketh evil, and not good, then without doubt, as the Apostle
James says, “it is dead, being alone.” <span
id="fr_1216"></span>[1217](#fn_1216) The same apostle says again, “What
doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have
not works? Can faith save him?” <span
id="fr_1217"></span>[1218](#fn_1217) And further, if a wicked man shall
be saved by fire on account of his faith alone, and if this is what the
blessed Apostle Paul means when he says, “But he himself shall be saved,
yet so as by fire;” <span id="fr_1218"></span>[1219](#fn_1218) then
faith without works can save a man, and what his fellow-apostle James
says must be false. And that must be false which Paul himself says in
another place: “Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor
thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners;
shall inherit the kingdom of God.” <span
id="fr_1219"></span>[1220](#fn_1219) For if those who persevere in these
wicked courses shall nevertheless be saved on account of their faith in
Christ, how can it be true that they shall not inherit the kingdom of
God?
