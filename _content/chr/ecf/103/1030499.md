<span id="v.i.xvi-p1"></span> 16. But God wanted not power to make man
such as that he should not be able to sin: but He chose rather to make
him such, as that it should lie in his power <span
id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858) to sin, if he would; not to sin, if
he would not; forbidding the one, enjoining the other; that it might be
to him first a good desert not to sin, and after a just reward not to be
able to sin. For such also at the last will He makes His Saints, as to
be without all power to sin. Such forsooth even now hath He His angels,
whom in Him we so love, as to have no fear for any of them, lest by
sinning he become a devil. And this we presume not of any just man in
this mortal life. But we trust that all will be such in that immortal
life. For Almighty God Who worketh good even of our evils, what good
will He give, when He shall have set us free from all evils? Much may be
said more fully and more subtilely on the good use of evil; but this is
not what we have undertaken in our present discourse, and we must avoid
in it excess of length.
