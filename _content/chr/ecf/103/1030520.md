<span id="v.ii.iv-p1"></span> 3. This we now say, that, according to
this condition of being born and dying, which we know, and in which we
have been created, the marriage of male and female is some good; the
compact whereof divine Scripture so commends, as that neither is it
allowed one put away by her husband to marry, so long as her husband
lives: nor is it allowed one put away by his wife to marry another,
unless she who have separated from him be dead. Therefore, concerning
the good of marriage, which the Lord also confirmed in the Gospel, not
only in that He forbade to put away a wife, <span
id="fr_1939"></span>[1940](#fn_1939) save because of fornication, but
also in that He came by invitation to a marriage, <span
id="fr_1940"></span>[1941](#fn_1940) there is good ground to inquire for
what reason it be a good. And this seems not to me to be merely on
account of the begetting of children, but also on account of the natural
society itself in a difference of sex. Otherwise it would not any longer
be called marriage in the case of old persons, especially if either they
had lost sons, or had given birth to none. But now in good, although
aged, marriage, albeit there hath withered away the glow of full age
between male and female, yet there lives in full vigor the order of
charity between husband and wife: because, the better they are, the
earlier they have begun by mutual consent to contain from sexual
intercourse with each other: not that it should be matter of necessity
afterwards not to have power to do what they would, but that it should
be matter of praise to have been unwilling at the first, to do what they
had power to do. If therefore there be kept good faith of honor, and of
services mutually due from either sex, although the members of either be
languishing and almost corpse-like, yet of souls duly joined together,
the chastity <span id="fr_1941"></span>[1942](#fn_1941) continues, the
purer by how much it is the more proved, the safer, by how much it is
the calmer. Marriages have this good also, that carnal or youthful
incontinence, although it be faulty, is brought unto an honest use in
the begetting of children, in order that out of the evil of lust the
marriage union may bring to pass some good. Next, in that the lust of
the flesh is repressed, and rages in a way more modestly, being tempered
by parental affection. For there is interposed a certain gravity of
glowing pleasure, when in that wherein husband and wife cleave to one
another, they have in mind that they be father and mother.
