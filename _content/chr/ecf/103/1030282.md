<span id="iv.ii.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32.—The Freedom of the Will is Also
the Gift of God, for God Worketh in Us Both to Will and to Do.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxxiv-p2"></span>And further, should any one be inclined
to boast, not indeed of his works, but of the freedom of his will, as if
the first merit belonged to him, this very liberty of good action being
given to him as a reward he had earned, let him listen to this same
preacher of grace, when he says: “For it is God which worketh in you,
both to will and to do of His own good pleasure;” <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[1133](#fn_1132) and in another place: “So, then, it
is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
showeth mercy.” <span id="fr_1133"></span>[1134](#fn_1133) Now as,
undoubtedly, if a man is of the age to use his reason, he cannot
believe, hope, love, unless he will to do so, nor obtain the prize of
the high calling of God unless he voluntarily run for it; in what sense
is it “not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
showeth mercy,” except that, as it is written, “the preparation of the
heart is from the Lord?” <span id="fr_1134"></span>[1135](#fn_1134)
Otherwise, if it is said, “It is not of him that willeth, nor of him
that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy,” because it is of both,
that is, both of the will of man and of the mercy of God, so that we are
to understand the saying, “It is not of him that willeth, nor of him
that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy,” as if it meant the will of
man alone is not sufficient, if the mercy of God go not with it,—then it
will follow that the mercy of God alone is not sufficient, if the will
of man go not with it; and therefore, if we may rightly say, “it is not
of man that willeth, but of God that showeth mercy,” because the will of
man by itself is not enough, why may we not also rightly put it in the
converse way: “It is not of God that showeth mercy, but of man that
willeth,” because the mercy of God by itself does not suffice? Surely,
if no Christian will dare to say this, “It is not of God that showeth
mercy, but of man that willeth,” lest he should openly contradict the
apostle, it follows that the true interpretation of the saying, “It is
not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
showeth mercy,” is that the whole work belongs to God, who both makes
the will of man righteous, and thus prepares it for assistance, and
assists it when it is prepared. For the man’s righteousness of will
precedes many of God’s gifts, but not all; and it must itself be
included among those which it does not precede. We read in Holy
Scripture, both that God’s mercy “shall meet me,” <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[1136](#fn_1135) and that His mercy “shall follow
me.” <span id="fr_1136"></span>[1137](#fn_1136) It goes before the
unwilling to make him willing; it follows the willing to make his will
effectual. Why are we taught to pray for our enemies, <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137) who are plainly unwilling to lead a
holy life, unless that God may work willingness in them? And why are we
ourselves taught to ask that we may receive, <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[1139](#fn_1138) unless that He who has created in
us the wish, may Himself satisfy the wish? We pray, then, for our
enemies, that the mercy of God may prevent them, as it has prevented us:
we pray for ourselves that His mercy may follow us.
