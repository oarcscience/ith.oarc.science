<span id="iv.ii.xciii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xciii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 91.—The Bodies of the Saints Shall
at The Resurrection Be Spiritual Bodies.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xciii-p2"></span>The bodies of the saints, then, shall
rise again free from every defect, from every blemish, as from all
corruption, weight, and impediment. For their ease of movement shall be
as complete as their happiness. Whence their bodies have been called
*spiritual*, though undoubtedly they shall be bodies and not spirits.
For just as now the body is called *animate*, though it is a body, and
not a soul \[*anima*\], so then the body shall be called spiritual,
though it shall be a body, not a spirit. <span
id="fr_1267"></span>[1268](#fn_1267) Hence, as far as regards the
corruption which now weighs down the soul, and the vices which urge the
flesh to lust against the spirit, <span
id="fr_1268"></span>[1269](#fn_1268) it shall not then be flesh, but
body; for there are bodies which are called celestial. Wherefore it is
said, “Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God;” and, as if in
explanation of this, “neither doth corruption inherit
incorruption.” <span id="fr_1269"></span>[1270](#fn_1269) What the
apostle first called “flesh and blood,” he afterwards calls
“corruption;” and what he first called “the kingdom of God,” he
afterwards calls “incorruption.” But as far as regards the substance,
even then it shall be flesh. For even after the resurrection the body of
Christ was called flesh. <span id="fr_1270"></span>[1271](#fn_1270) The
apostle, however, says: “It is sown a natural body; it is raised a
spiritual body;” <span id="fr_1271"></span>[1272](#fn_1271) because so
perfect shah then be the harmony between flesh and spirit, the spirit
keeping alive the subjugated flesh without the need of any nourishment,
that no part of our nature shall be in discord with another; but as we
shall be free from enemies without, so we shall not have ourselves for
enemies within.
