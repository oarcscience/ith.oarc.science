id="iv.ii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—Through Adam’s Sin His Whole
Posterity Were Corrupted, and Were Born Under the Penalty of Death,
Which He Had Incurred.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxviii-p2"></span>Thence, after his sin, he was driven
into exile, and by his sin the whole race of which he was the root was
corrupted in him, and thereby subjected to the penalty of death. And so
it happens that all descended from him, and from the woman who had led
him into sin, and was condemned at the same time with him,—being the
offspring of carnal lust on which the same punishment of disobedience
was visited,—were tainted with the original sin, and were by it drawn
through divers errors and sufferings into that last and endless
punishment which they suffer in common with the fallen angels, their
corrupters and masters, and the partakers of their doom. And thus “by
one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death
passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[1122](#fn_1121) By “the world” the apostle, of
course, means in this place the whole human race.
