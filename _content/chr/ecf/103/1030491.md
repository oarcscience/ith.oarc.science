<span id="v.i.viii-p1"></span> 8. Such soldiers the Apostolic trumpet
enkindles for battle with that sound, “Therefore let not,” saith he,
“sin reign in your mortal body to obey its lusts; nor yield your members
weapons of unrighteousness unto sin; but yield yourselves unto God, as
living in place of dead, and your members weapons of righteousness unto
God. For sin shall not rule over you. For ye are not under the law, but
under Grace.” <span id="fr_1829"></span>[1830](#fn_1829) And in another
place, “Therefore,” saith he, “brethren, we are debtors, not to the
flesh, to live after the flesh. For if ye shall live after the flesh, ye
shall die; but if by the Spirit ye shall mortify the deeds of the flesh,
ye shall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are
sons of God.” <span id="fr_1830"></span>[1831](#fn_1830) This therefore
is the business in hand, so long as this our mortal life under Grace
lasts, that sin, that is the lust of sin, (for this he in this place
calls by the name of sin,) reign not in this our mortal body. But it is
then shown to reign, if obedience be yielded to its desires. There is
therefore in us lust of sin, which must not be suffered to reign; there
are its desires, which we must not obey, lest obeying it reign over us.
Wherefore let not lust usurp our members, but let Continence claim them
for herself; that they be weapons of righteousness unto God, that they
be not weapons of unrighteousness unto sin; for thus sin shall not rule
over us. For we are not under the Law, which indeed commandeth what is
good yet giveth it not: but we are under Grace, which, making us to love
that which the Law commands, is able to rule over the free.
