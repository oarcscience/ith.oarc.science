<span id="iv.i.viii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.viii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—The Holy Spirit Also is Equal to
the Father and the Son in All Things.</span>

<span id="iv.i.viii.v-p2"></span>7. Wherefore also the Holy Spirit
consists in the same unity of substance, and in the same equality. For
whether He is the unity of both, or the holiness, or the love, or
therefore the unity because the love, and therefore the love because the
holiness, it is manifest that He is not one of the two, through whom the
two are joined, through whom the Begotten is loved by the Begetter, and
loves Him that begat Him, and through whom, not by participation, but by
their own essence, neither by the gift of any superior, but by their
own, they are “keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
peace;” <span id="fr_610"></span>[611](#fn_610) which we are commanded
to imitate by grace, both towards God and towards ourselves. “On which
two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” <span
id="fr_611"></span>[612](#fn_611) So those three are God, one, alone,
great, wise, holy, blessed. But we are blessed from Him, and through
Him, and in Him; because we ourselves are one by His gift, and one
spirit with Him, because our soul cleaves to Him so as to follow Him.
And it is good for us to cleave to God, since He will destroy every man
who is estranged from Him. <span id="fr_612"></span>[613](#fn_612)
Therefore the Holy Spirit, whatever it is, is something common both to
the Father and Son. But that communion itself is consubstantial and
co-eternal; and if it may fitly be called friendship, let it be so
called; but it is more aptly called love. And this is also a substance,
since God is a substance, and “God is love,” as it is written. <span
id="fr_613"></span>[614](#fn_613) But as He is a substance together with
the Father and the Son, so that substance is together with them great,
and together with them good, and together with them holy, and whatsoever
else is said in reference to substance; since it is not one thing to God
to be, and another to be great or to be good, and the rest, as we have
shown above. For if love is less great therein \[*i.e.* in God\] than
wisdom, then wisdom is loved in less degree than according to what it
is; love is therefore equal, in order that wisdom may be loved according
to its being; but wisdom is equal with the Father, as we have proved
above; therefore also the Holy Spirit is equal; and if equal, equal in
all things, on account of the absolute simplicity which is in that
substance. And therefore they are not more than three: One who loves Him
who is from Himself, and One who loves Him from whom He is, and Love
itself. And if this last is nothing, how is “God love”? If it is not
substance, how is God substance?
