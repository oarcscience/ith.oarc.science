<span id="v.iii.xxiii-p1"></span> 22. And now by plainest witnesses of
divine Scriptures, such as according to the small measure of our memory
we shall be able to remember, let it more clearly appear, that, not on
account of the present life of this world, but on account of that future
life which is promised in the kingdom of heaven, we are to choose
perpetual continence. But who but must observe this in that which the
same Apostle says a little after, “Whoso is without a wife has thought
of the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord: but whoso is joined
in marriage has thought of the things of the world, how to please his
wife. And a woman unmarried and a virgin is divided; <span
id="fr_2062"></span>[2063](#fn_2062) she that is unmarried is careful
about the things of the Lord, to be holy both in body and spirit: but
she that is married is careful about the things of the world, how to
please her husband.” <span id="fr_2063"></span>[2064](#fn_2063)
Certainly he saith not, hath thought of the things of a state without
care in this world, to pass her time without weightier troubles; nor
doth he say that a woman unmarried and a virgin is divided, that is,
distinguished, and separated from her who is married, for this end, that
the unmarried woman be without care in this life, in order to avoid
temporal troubles, which the married woman is not free from: but, “She
hath thought,” saith he, “of the things of the Lord, how to please the
Lord; and is careful about the things of the Lord, to be holy both in
body and spirit.” Unless to such a degree, perchance, each be foolishly
contentious, as to essay to assert, that it is not on account of the
kingdom of heaven, but on account of this present world, that we wish to
“please the Lord,” or that it is on account of this present life, not on
account of life eternal, that they are “holy both in body and spirit.”
To believe this, what else is it, than to be more miserable than all
men? For so the Apostle saith, “If in this life only we are hoping in
Christ, we are more miserable than all men.” <span
id="fr_2064"></span>[2065](#fn_2064) What? is he who breaks his bread to
the hungry, if he do it only on account of this life, a fool; and shall
he be prudent, who chastens his own body even unto continence, whereby
he hath no intercourse even in marriage, if it shall profit him nought
in the kingdom of heaven?
