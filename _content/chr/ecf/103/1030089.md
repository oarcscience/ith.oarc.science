Reciprocal, Names are Sometimes Wanting.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vii.xii-p2"></span>13. Neither ought it to influence
us—since we have said that the Holy Spirit is so called relatively, not
the Trinity itself, but He who is in the Trinity—that the designation of
Him to whom He is referred, does not seem to answer in turn to His
designation. For we cannot, as we say the servant of a master, and the
master of a servant, the son of a father and the father of a son, so
also say here—because these things are said relatively. For we speak of
the Holy Spirit of the Father; but, on the other hand, we do not speak
of the Father of the Holy Spirit, lest the Holy Spirit should be
understood to be His Son. So also we speak of the Holy Spirit of the
Son; but we do not speak of the Son of the <span id="page_94">p.
94</span> <span id="iv.i.vii.xii-Page_94"></span>Holy Spirit, lest the
Holy Spirit be understood to be His Father. For it is the case in many
relatives, that no designation is to be found by which those things
which bear relation to each other may \[in name\] mutually correspond to
each other. For what is more clearly spoken relatively than the word
earnest? Since it is referred to that of which it is an earnest, and an
earnest is always an earnest of something. Can we then, as we say, the
earnest of the Father and of the Son, <span
id="fr_588"></span>[589](#fn_588) say in turn, the Father of the earnest
or the Son of the earnest? But, on the other hand, when we say the gift
of the Father and of the Son, we cannot indeed say the Father of the
gift, or the Son of the gift; but that these may correspond mutually to
each other, we say the gift of the giver and the giver of the gift;
because here a word in use may be found, there it cannot.
