<span id="v.vii.xviii-p1"></span> 17. On account then of these either
occupations of the servants of God, or bodily infirmities, which cannot
be altogether wanting, not only doth the Apostle permit the needs of
saints to be supplied by good believers, but also most wholesomely
exhorteth. For, setting apart that power, which he saith himself had not
used, which yet that the faithful must serve unto, he enjoins, saying,
“Let him that is catechised in the word, communicate unto him that doth
catechise him, in all good things:” <span
id="fr_2530"></span>[2531](#fn_2530) setting apart, then, this power,
which that the preachers of the word have over them to whom they preach,
he often testifieth; speaking, moreover, of the saints who had sold all
that they had and distributed the same, and were dwelling at Jerusalem
in an holy communion of life, not saying that any thing was their own,
to whom all things were in common, <span
id="fr_2531"></span>[2532](#fn_2531) and their soul and heart one in the
Lord: that these by the Churches of the Gentiles should have what they
needed bestowed upon them, he chargeth and exhorteth. Thence is also
that to the Romans: “Now therefore I will go unto Jerusalem, to minister
unto the saints. For it hath pleased Macedonia and Achaia to make a
certain contribution for the poor of the saints which are at Jerusalem.
For it hath pleased them; and their debtors they are. For if in their
spiritual things the Gentiles have communicated, they ought also in
carnal things to minister unto them.” <span
id="fr_2532"></span>[2533](#fn_2532) This is like that which he says to
the Corinthians: “If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a
great thing if we reap your carnal things?” <span
id="fr_2533"></span>[2534](#fn_2533) Also to the Corinthians in the
second Epistle: “Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of
God bestowed on the Churches of Macedonia; how that in a great trial of
affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded in
the riches of their liberality; for to their power, I bear record, yea,
and beyond their power, they were willing of themselves; with many
prayers beseeching of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministering
to the saints: and not as we hoped, but first they gave their own selves
to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God, insomuch, that we desired
Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same
grace also. But as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance,
and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye
abound in this grace also. I speak not by commandment, but by occasion
of the forwardness of others, and to prove the exceeding dearness of
your love. For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though
He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His
poverty might be made rich. And herein I give advice: for this is
expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be
willing a year ago; now therefore perfect it in the doing; that as there
is a readiness to will, so of performance also out of that which each
hath. For if there be first a ready mind, it is acceptable according to
that a man hath, not according to that he hath not. Not, namely, that
others may have ease, and ye straits; but by an equality, that <span
id="page_513">p. 513</span> <span id="v.vii.xviii-Page_513"></span>now
at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their
abundance also may become a supply for your want: that there may be
equality, as it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over;
and he that had gathered little had no lack. But thanks be to God, which
put the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus: for indeed he
accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he
went forth unto you. And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise
is in the Gospel throughout all the Churches; and not that only, but he
was also ordained of the Churches as a companion of our travail, with
this grace which is administered by us to the glory of the Lord, and our
ready mind: avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance
which is administered by us. For we provide for honest things, not only
in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.” <span
id="fr_2534"></span>[2535](#fn_2534) In these words appeareth how
much <span id="fr_2535"></span>[2536](#fn_2535) the Apostle willed it
not only to be the care of the holy congregations <span
id="fr_2536"></span>[2537](#fn_2536) to minister necessaries to the holy
servants of God, giving counsel in this, because this was profitable
more to the persons themselves who did this, than to them towards whom
they did it, (for to those another thing was profitable, that is, that
they should make of this service of their brethren towards them an holy
use, and not with an eye to this serve God, nor take these things but to
supply necessity, not to feed laziness:) but likewise his own care the
blessed Apostle saith to be so great in this ministration which was now
in transmitting through Titus, that a companion of his journey was on
this account, he tells us, ordained by the Churches, a man of God well
reported of, “whose praise,” says he, “is in the Gospel throughout all
the Churches.” And to this end, he says, was the same ordained to be his
companion, that he might avoid men’s reprehensions, lest, without
witness of saints associated with him in this ministry, he should be
thought by weak and impious men to receive for himself and turn aside
into his own bosom, what he was receiving for supplying the necessities
of the saints, by him to be brought and distributed to the needy.
