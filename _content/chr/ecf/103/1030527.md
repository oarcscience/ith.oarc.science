<span id="v.ii.xi-p1"></span> 10. But I am aware of some that murmur:
What, say they, if all men should abstain from all sexual intercourse,
whence will the human race exist? Would that all would this, only in
“charity out of a pure heart, and good conscience, and faith
unfeigned;” <span id="fr_1961"></span>[1962](#fn_1961) much more
speedily would the City of God be filled, and the end of the world
hastened. For what else doth the Apostle, as is manifest, exhort to,
when he saith, speaking on this head, “I would that all were as
myself;” <span id="fr_1962"></span>[1963](#fn_1962) or in that passage,
“But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remains that both they
who have wives, be as though not having: and they who weep, as though
not weeping: and they who rejoice, as though not rejoicing: and they who
buy, as though not buying: and they who use this world as though they
use it not. For the form of this world passeth by. I would have you
without care.” Then he adds, “Whoso is without a wife thinks of the
things of the Lord, how to please the Lord: but whoso is joined in
marriage, thinks of the things of the world, how to please his wife: and
a woman that is unmarried and a virgin is different: she that is
unmarried is anxious about the things of the Lord, to be holy both in
body and spirit: but she that is married, is anxious about the things of
the world, how to please her husband.” <span
id="fr_1963"></span>[1964](#fn_1963) Whence it seems to me, that at this
time, those only, who contain not, ought to marry, according to that
sentence of the same Apostle, “But if they contain not, let them be
married: for it is better to be married than to burn.” <span
