<span id="iv.ii.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37.—The Same Grace is Further
Clearly Manifested in This, that the Birth of Christ According to the
Flesh is of the Holy Ghost.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxxix-p2"></span>For the same Jesus Christ who is the
only-begotten, that is, the only Son of God, our Lord, was born of the
Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary. And we know that the Holy Spirit is
the gift of God, the gift being Himself indeed equal to the Giver. And
therefore the Holy Spirit also is God, not inferior to the Father and
the Son. The fact, therefore, that the nativity of Christ in His human
nature was by the Holy Spirit, is another clear manifestation of grace.
For when the Virgin asked the angel how this which he had announced
should be, seeing she knew not a man, the angel answered, “The Holy
Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall
overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of
thee shall be called the Son of God.” <span

her away, suspecting her of adultery, as he knew she was not with child
by himself, he was told by the angel, “Fear not to take unto thee Mary
thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy
Ghost:” <span id="fr_1154"></span>[1155](#fn_1154) that is, what thou
suspectest to be begotten of another man is of the Holy Ghost.
