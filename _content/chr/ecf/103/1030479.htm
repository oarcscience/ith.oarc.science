<p class="c10"><a name="iv.vii.xv-p1"></A>  15. &#8220;Forgiveness of sins.&#8221; Ye have [this article of] the Creed perfectly in you when ye receive Baptism. Let none say, &#8220;I have done this or that sin: perchance that is not forgiven me.&#8221; What hast thou done? How great a sin hast thou done? Name any heinous thing thou hast committed, heavy, horrible, which thou shudderest even to think of: have done what thou wilt: hast thou killed Christ? There is not than that deed any worse, because also than Christ there is nothing better. What a dreadful thing is it to kill Christ! Yet the Jews killed Him, and many afterwards believed on Him and drank His blood: they are forgiven the sin which they committed. When ye have been baptized, hold fast a good life in the commandments of God, that ye may guard your Baptism even unto the end. I do not tell you that ye will live here without sin; but they are venial, without which this life is not. For the sake of all sins was Baptism provided; for the sake of light sins, without which we cannot be, was prayer provided.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1802"></A><A HREF="#fn_1802"><FONT SIZE="1">1803</FONT></A>
 What hath <A NAME="page_375"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 375</FONT></A> <a name="iv.vii.xv-Page_375"></A>the Prayer? &#8220;Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1803"></A><A HREF="#fn_1803"><FONT SIZE="1">1804</FONT></A>
 Once for all we have washing in Baptism, every day we have washing in prayer. Only, do not commit those things for which ye must needs be separated from Christ&#146;s body: which be far from you! For those whom ye have seen doing penance,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1804"></A><A HREF="#fn_1804"><FONT SIZE="1">1805</FONT></A>
 have committed heinous things, either adulteries or some enormous crimes: for these they do penance. Because if theirs had been light sins, to blot out these daily prayer would suffice.</p>
