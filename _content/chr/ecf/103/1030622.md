<span id="v.iv.x-p1"></span> 9. Learn, therefore, that thy good, yea,
rather, remember what thou hast learned, that thy good is more praised,
because there is another good than which this is better, than if this
could not on any other condition be a good, unless that were an evil, or
altogether were not. The eyes have great honor in the body, but they
would have less, if they were alone, and there were not other members of
less honor. In heaven itself the sun by its light surpasses, not chides,
the moon; and star from star differs in glory, <span
id="fr_2239"></span>[2240](#fn_2239) not is at variance through pride.
Therefore, “God made all things, and, lo, very good;” <span
id="fr_2240"></span>[2241](#fn_2240) not only “good,” but also “very;”
for no other reason, than because “all.” For of each several work
throughout it was also said, “God saw that it is good.” But, when “all”
were named, “very” was added; and it was said, “God saw all things which
He made, and, lo, very good.” For certain several things were better
than other several, but all together better than any several. Therefore,
may the sound doctrine of Christ make thee in His Body sound through His
Grace, that, what thou hast better than others in body and spirit, the
self-same thy spirit, which ruleth the body, may neither extol with
insolence, nor distinguish with lack of knowledge.
