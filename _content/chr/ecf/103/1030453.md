<span id="iv.vi.xxvii-p1"></span> 26. For I ask, if what is not known
must not be believed, in what way may children do service to their
parents, and love with mutual affection those whom they believe not to
be their parents? For it cannot, by any means, be known by reason. But
the authority of the mother comes in, that it be believed of the father;
but of the mother it is usually not the mother that is believed, but
midwives, nurses, servants. For she, from whom a son may be stolen and
another put in his place, may she not being deceived deceive? Yet we
believe, and believe without any doubt, what we confess we cannot know.
For who but must see, that unless it be so, filial affection, the most
sacred bond of the human race, is violated by extreme pride of
wickedness? For what madman even would think him to be blamed who
discharged the duties that were due to those whom he believed to be his
parents, although they were not so? Who, on the other hand, would not
judge him to deserve banishment, who failed to love those who were
perhaps his true parents, through fear lest he should love pretended.
Many things may be alleged, whereby to show that nothing at all of human
society remains safe, if we shall determine to believe nothing, which we
cannot grasp by full apprehension. <span
