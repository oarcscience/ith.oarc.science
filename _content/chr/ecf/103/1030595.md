<span id="v.iii.xlii-p1"></span> 41. Or are we indeed to believe that it
is for any other reason, that God suffers to be mixed up with the number
of your profession, many, both men and women, about to fall, than that
by the fall of these your fear may be increased, whereby to repress
pride; which God so hates, as that against this one thing The Highest
humbled Himself? Unless haply, in truth, thou shalt therefore fear less,
and be more puffed up, so as to love little Him, Who hath loved thee so
much, as to give up Himself for thee, <span
id="fr_2161"></span>[2162](#fn_2161) because He hath forgiven thee
little, living, forsooth from childhood, religiously, piously, with
pious chastity, with inviolate virginity. As though in truth you ought
not to love with much greater glow of affection Him, Who, whatsoever
things He hath forgiven unto sinners upon their being turned to Him,
suffered you not to fall into them. Or indeed that Pharisee, <span
id="fr_2162"></span>[2163](#fn_2162) who therefore loved little, because
he thought that little was forgiven him, was it for any other reason
that he was blinded by this error, than because being ignorant of the
righteousness of God, and seeking to establish his own, he had not been
made subject unto the righteousness of God? <span
id="fr_2163"></span>[2164](#fn_2163) But you, an elect race, and among
the elect more elect, virgin choirs that follow the Lamb, even you “by
grace have been saved through faith; and this not of yourselves, but it
is the gift of God: not of works, lest haply any be elated. For we are
His workmanship, created in Jesus Christ in good works, which God hath
prepared, that in them we may walk.” <span
id="fr_2164"></span>[2165](#fn_2164) What therefore, by how much the
more ye are adorned by His gifts, shall ye by so much the less love Him?
May He Himself turn away so dreadful madness! Wherefore forasmuch as the
Truth has spoken the truth, that he, unto whom little is forgiven,
loveth little; do ye, in order that ye may love with full glow of
affection Him, Whom ye are free to love, being loosened from ties of
marriage, account as altogether forgiven unto you, whatever of evil, by
His governance, ye have not committed. For “your eyes ever unto the
Lord, forasmuch as He shall pluck out of the net your feet,” <span
id="fr_2165"></span>[2166](#fn_2165) and, “Except the Lord shall have
kept the city, in vain hath he watched who keepeth it.” <span
id="fr_2166"></span>[2167](#fn_2166) And speaking of Continence itself
the Apostle says, “But I would that all men were as I myself; but each
one hath his own proper gift from God; one in this way, and another in
that way.” <span id="fr_2167"></span>[2168](#fn_2167) Who therefore
bestoweth these gifts? Who distributeth his own proper gifts unto each
as He will? <span id="fr_2168"></span>[2169](#fn_2168) Forsooth God,
with Whom there is not unrighteousness, <span
id="fr_2169"></span>[2170](#fn_2169) and by this means with what equity
He makes some in this way, and others in that way, for man to know is
either impossible or altogether hard: but that with <span
id="page_433">p. 433</span> <span id="v.iii.xlii-Page_433"></span>equity
He maketh, it is not lawful to doubt. “What,” therefore, “hast thou,
which thou hast not received?” <span
id="fr_2170"></span>[2171](#fn_2170) And by what perversity dost thou
less love Him, of Whom thou hast received more?
