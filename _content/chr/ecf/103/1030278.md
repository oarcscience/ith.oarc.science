id="iv.ii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—When the Rebellious Angels Were
Cast Out, the Rest Remained in the Enjoyment of Eternal Happiness with
God.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxx-p2"></span>Whilst some of the angels, then, in their
<span id="page_247">p. 247</span> <span
id="iv.ii.xxx-Page_247"></span>pride and impiety rebelled against God,
and were cast down from their heavenly abode into the lowest darkness,
the remaining number dwelt with God in eternal and unchanging purity and
happiness. For all were not sprung from one angel who had fallen and
been condemned, so that they were not all, like men, involved by one
original sin in the bonds of an inherited guilt, and so made subject to
the penalty which one had incurred; but when he, who afterwards became
the devil, was with his associates in crime exalted in pride, and by
that very exaltation was with them cast down, the rest remained
steadfast in piety and obedience to their Lord, and obtained, what
before they had not enjoyed, a sure and certain knowledge of their
eternal safety, and freedom from the possibility of falling.
