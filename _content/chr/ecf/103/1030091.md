<span id="iv.i.vii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.vii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—The Father and the Son the
Only Beginning (Principium) of the Holy Spirit.</span>

<span id="iv.i.vii.xiv-p2"></span>15. But in their mutual relation to
one another in the Trinity itself, if the begetter is a beginning in
relation to that which he begets, the Father is a beginning in relation
to the Son, because He begets Him; but whether the Father is also a
beginning in relation to the Holy Spirit, since it is said, “He proceeds
from the Father,” is no small question. Because, if it is so, He will
not only be a beginning to that thing which He begets or makes, but also
to that which He gives. And here, too, that question comes to light, as
it can, which is wont to trouble many, Why the Holy Spirit is not also a
son, since He, too, comes forth from the Father, as it is read in the
Gospel. <span id="fr_591"></span>[592](#fn_591) For the Spirit came
forth, not as born, but as given; and so He is not called a son, because
He was neither born, as the Only-begotten, nor made, so that by the
grace of God He might be born into adoption, as we are. For that which
is born of the Father, is referred to the Father only when called Son,
and so the Son is the Son of the Father, and not also our Son; but that
which is given is referred both to Him who gave, and to those to whom He
gave; and so the Holy Spirit is not only the Spirit of the Father and of
the Son who gave Him, but <span id="page_95">p. 95</span> <span
id="iv.i.vii.xiv-Page_95"></span>He is also called ours, who have
received Him: as “The salvation of the Lord,” <span
id="fr_592"></span>[593](#fn_592) who gives salvation, is said also to
be our salvation, who have received it. Therefore, the Spirit is both
the Spirit of God who gave Him, and ours who have received Him. Not,
indeed, that spirit of ours by which we are, because that is the spirit
of a man which is in him; but this Spirit is ours in another mode,
*viz*. that in which we also say, “Give us this day our bread.” <span
id="fr_593"></span>[594](#fn_593) Although certainly we have received
that spirit also, which is called the spirit of a man. “For what hast
thou,” he says, “which thou didst not receive?” <span
id="fr_594"></span>[595](#fn_594) But that is one thing, which we have
received that we might be; another, that which we have received that we
might be holy. Whence it is also written of John, that he “came in the
spirit and power of Elias;” <span id="fr_595"></span>[596](#fn_595) and
by the spirit of Elias is meant the Holy Spirit, whom Elias received.
And the same thing is to be understood of Moses, when the Lord says to
him, “And I will take of thy spirit, and will put it upon them;” <span
id="fr_596"></span>[597](#fn_596) that is, I will give to them of the
Holy Spirit, which I have already given to thee. If, therefore, that
also which is given has him for a beginning by whom it is given, since
it has received from no other source that which proceeds from him; it
must be admitted that the Father and the Son are a Beginning of the Holy
Spirit, not two Beginnings; but as the Father and Son are one God, and
one Creator, and one Lord relatively to the creature, so are they one
Beginning relatively to the Holy Spirit. But the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Spirit is one Beginning in respect to the creature, as also one
Creator and one God. <span id="fr_597"></span>[598](#fn_597)

<span id="iv.i.vii.xiv-p9"></span> \[The term “beginning”
(*principium*), when referring to the relation of the Trinity, or of any
person of the Trinity, to the creature, denotes *creative* energy,
whereby a new substance is originated from nothing. This is the
reference in chapter 13. But when the term refers to the relations of
the persons of the Trinity to each other, it denotes only a *modifying*
energy, whereby an existing uncreated substance is communicated by
generation and spiration. This is the reference in chapter 14.

<span id="iv.i.vii.xiv-p10"></span>When it is said that the Father is
the “beginning” of the Son, and the Father and Son are the “beginning”
of the Spirit, it is not meant that the substance of the Son is created
*ex nihilo* by the Father, and the substance of the Spirit is created by
the Father and Son, but only that the Son by eternal generation receives
from the Father the one uncreated and undivided substance of the
Godhead, and the Spirit by eternal spiration receives the same numerical
substance from the Father and Son. The term “beginning” relates not to
the essence, but to the personal peculiarity. Sonship originates in
fatherhood; but deity is unoriginated. The Son as the second person
“begins” from the Father, because the Father communicates the essence to
him. His sonship, not his deity or godhood, “begins” from the Father.
And the same holds true of the term “beginning” as applied to the Holy
Spirit. The “procession” of the Holy Spirit “begins” by spiration from
the Father and Son, but not his deity or godhood.—W.G.T.S.\]
