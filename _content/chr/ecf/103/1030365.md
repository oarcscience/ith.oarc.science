<span id="iv.ii.cxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.cxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 115.—The Seven Petitions of the
Lord’s Prayer, According to Matthew.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.cxvii-p2"></span>Accordingly, in the Gospel according to
Matthew the Lord’s Prayer seems to embrace seven petitions, three of
which ask for eternal blessings, and the remaining four for temporal;
these latter, however, being necessary antecedents to the attainment of
the eternal. For when we say, “Hallowed be Thy name: Thy kingdom come:
Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven” <span
id="fr_1310"></span>[1311](#fn_1310) (which some have interpreted, not
unfairly, in body as well as in spirit), we ask for blessings that are
to be enjoyed for ever; which are indeed begun in this world, and grow
in us as we grow in grace, but in their perfect state, which is to be
looked for in another life, shall be a possession for evermore. But when
we say, “Give us this day our daily bread: and forgive us our debts, as
we forgive our debtors: and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us
from evil,” <span id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311) who does not see
that we ask for blessings that have reference to the wants of this
present life? In that eternal life, where we hope to live for ever, the
hallowing of God’s name, and His kingdom, and His will in our spirit and
body, shall be brought to perfection, and shall endure to everlasting.
But our *daily* bread is so called because there is here constant need
for as much nourishment as the spirit and the flesh demand, whether we
understand the expression spiritually, or carnally, or in both senses.
It is here too that we need the forgiveness that we ask, for it is here
that we commit the sins; here are the temptations which allure or drive
us into sin; here, in a word, is the evil from which we desire
deliverance: but in that other world there shall be none of these
things.
