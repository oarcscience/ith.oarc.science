<span id="v.ii.xxii"></span>

<span id="v.ii.xxii-p1"></span> 21. But since out of many souls there
shall be hereafter one City of such as have one soul and one heart <span
id="fr_1987"></span>[1988](#fn_1987) towards God; which perfection of
our unity shall be hereafter, after this sojourn in a strange land,
wherein the thoughts of all shall neither be hidden one from another,
nor shall be in any matter opposed one to another; on this account the
Sacrament of marriage of our time hath been so reduced to one man and
one wife, as that it is not lawful to ordain any as a steward of the
Church, save the husband of one wife. <span
id="fr_1988"></span>[1989](#fn_1988) And this they have understood more
acutely who have been of opinion, that neither is he to be
ordained, <span id="fr_1989"></span>[1990](#fn_1989) who as a catechumen
or as a heathen <span id="fr_1990"></span>[1991](#fn_1990) had a second
wife. For it is a matter of sacrament, not of sin. For in baptism all
sins are put away. But he who said, “If thou shall have taken a wife,
thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin shall have been married, she
sinneth not:” <span id="fr_1991"></span>[1992](#fn_1991) and, “Let her
do what she will, she sinneth not, if she be married,” hath made it
plain enough that marriage is no sin. But on account of the sanctity of
the Sacrament, as a female, although it be as a catechumen that she hath
suffered violence, cannot after Baptism be consecrated among the virgins
of God: so there was no absurdity in supposing of him who had exceeded
the number of one wife, not that he had committed any sin, but that he
had lost a certain prescript rule <span
id="fr_1992"></span>[1993](#fn_1992) of a sacrament necessary not unto
desert of good life, but unto the seal of ecclesiastic ordination; and
thus, as the many wives of the old Fathers signified our future Churches
out of all nations made subject unto one husband, Christ: so our
chief-priest, <span id="fr_1993"></span>[1994](#fn_1993) the husband of
one wife, signifies unity out of all nations, made subject unto one
husband, Christ: which shall then be perfected, when He shall have
unveiled the hidden things of darkness, <span
id="fr_1994"></span>[1995](#fn_1994) and shall have made manifest the
thoughts of the heart, that then each may have praise from God. But now
there are manifest, there are hidden, dissensions, even where charity is
safe between those, who shall be hereafter one, and in one; which shall
then certainly have no existence. As therefore the Sacrament of marriage
with several of that time signified the multitude that should be
hereafter made subject unto God in all nations of the earth, so the
Sacrament of marriage with one of our times signifies the unity of us
all made subject to God, which shall be hereafter in one Heavenly City.
Therefore as to serve two or more, so to pass over from a living husband
into marriage with another, was neither lawful then, nor is it lawful
now, nor will it ever be lawful. Forsooth to apostatise from the One
God, and to go into adulterous superstition of another, is ever an evil.
Therefore not even for the sake of a more numerous family did our Saints
do, what the Roman Cato is said to have done, <span
id="fr_1995"></span>[1996](#fn_1995) to give up his wife, during his own
life, to fill even another’s house with sons. Forsooth in the marriage
of one woman the sanctity of the Sacrament is of more avail than the
fruitfulness of the womb.
