<span id="v.iii.liii-p1"></span> 52. Here some one will say, This is now
not to write of virginity, but of humility. As though truly it were any
kind of virginity, and not that which is after God, which we had
undertaken to set forth. And this good, by how much I see it to be
great, by so much I fear for it, lest it be lost, the thief pride.
Therefore there is none that guardeth the virginal good, save God
Himself Who gave it: and God is Charity. <span
id="fr_2210"></span>[2211](#fn_2210) The Guardian therefore of virginity
is Charity: but the place of this Guardian is humility. There forsooth
He dwelleth, Who said, that on the lowly and quiet, and that trembleth
at His words, His Spirit resteth. <span
id="fr_2211"></span>[2212](#fn_2211) What, therefore, have I done
foreign from my purpose, if wishing the good, which I have praised, to
be more securely guarded, I have taken care also to prepare a place for
the Guardian? For I speak with confidence, nor have I any fear lest they
be angry with me, whom I admonish with care to fear for themselves
together with me. More easily do follow the Lamb, although not
whithersoever He shall have gone, yet so far as they shall have had
power, married persons who are humble, than virgins who are proud. For
how doth one follow Him, unto Whom one wills not to approach or how doth
one approach Him, unto Whom one comes not to learn, “in that I am meek
and lowly of heart?” Wherefore those the Lamb leadeth following
whithersoever He shall have gone, in whom first Himself shall have found
where to lay His Head. For also a certain proud and crafty person had
said to Him, “Lord, I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou shalt have
gone;” <span id="fr_2212"></span>[2213](#fn_2212) to whom He made
answer, “Foxes have dens, and fowls of heaven nests: but the Son of Man
hath not where to lay His Head.” By the term of foxes He reproved wily
craftiness, and by the name of birds puffed-up arrogance, wherein He
found not pious humility to rest in. And by this no where at all did he
follow the Lord, who had promised that he would follow Him, not unto a
certain point of progress, but altogether whithersoever He should have
gone.
