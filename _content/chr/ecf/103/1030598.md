<span id="v.iii.xlv-p1"></span> 44. Next let not man, now that he
knoweth that by the grace of God he is what he is, fall into another
snare of pride, so as by lifting up himself for the very grace of God to
despise the rest. By which fault that other Pharisee both gave thanks
unto God for the goods which he had, and yet vaunted himself above the
Publican confessing his sins. What therefore should a virgin do, what
should she think, that she vaunt not herself above those, men or women,
who have not this so great gift? For she ought not to feign humility,

id="v.iii.xlv-Page_434"></span>but to set it forth: for the feigning of
humility is greater pride. Wherefore Scripture wishing to show that
humility ought to be true, after having said, “By how much thou art
great, by so much humble thyself in all things,” added soon after, “And
thou shalt find grace before God:” <span
