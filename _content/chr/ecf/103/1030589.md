<span id="v.iii.xxxvi-p1"></span> 35. Certainly we are to contemplate in
Christ Himself, the chief instruction and pattern of virginal purity.
What further precept then concerning humility shall I give to the
continent, than what He saith to all, “Learn of Me, in that I am meek
and lowly of heart?” <span id="fr_2119"></span>[2120](#fn_2119) when He
had made mention above of His greatness, and, wishing to show this very
thing, how great He was, and how <span id="page_430">p. 430</span> <span
id="v.iii.xxxvi-Page_430"></span>little He had been made for our sakes,
saith, “I confess to Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, in that
Thou hast hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and hast
revealed them unto little children. Even so, O Father, in that so it
hath been pleasing before Thee. All things have been delivered unto Me
of My Father: and no one knoweth the Son, save the Father; and no one
knoweth the Father, save the Son, and he to whom the Son shall have
willed to reveal Him. Come unto Me, all ye who labor and are burdened,
and I will refresh you. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me, in that
I am meek and lowly of heart.” <span
id="fr_2120"></span>[2121](#fn_2120) He, He, unto Whom the Father hath
delivered all things, and Whom no one knoweth but the Father, and Who
alone, (and he, unto whom He shall have willed to reveal Him), knoweth
the Father, saith not, “Learn of Me” to make the world, or to raise the
dead, but, “in that I am meek and lowly of heart.” O saving teaching? O
Teacher and Lord of mortals, unto whom death was pledged and passed on
in the cup of pride, He would not teach what Himself was not, He would
not bid what Himself did not. I see Thee, O good Jesu, with the eyes of
faith, which Thou hast opened for me, as in an assembly of the human
race, crying out and saying, “Come unto Me, and learn of Me.” What, I
beseech Thee, through Whom all things were made, O Son of God, and the
Same Who was made among all things, O Son of Man: to learn what of Thee,
come we to Thee? “For that I am meek,” saith He, “and lowly of heart.”
Is it to this that all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden in
Thee <span id="fr_2121"></span>[2122](#fn_2121) are brought, that we
learn this of Thee as a great thing, that Thou art “meek and lowly of
heart?” Is it so great a thing to be little, that it could not at all be
learned unless it were brought to pass by Thee, Who art so great? So
indeed it is. For by no other way is there found out rest for the soul,
save when the unquiet swelling hath been dispersed, whereby it was great
unto itself, when it was not sound unto Thee.
