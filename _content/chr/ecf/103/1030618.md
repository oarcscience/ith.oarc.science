<span id="v.iv.vi-p1"></span> 5. Wherefore also when he was advising
married persons not to defraud one another of the due of carnal
intercourse; lest, by this means, the one of them, (the due of marriage
being denied to him,) being through his own incontinence tempted of
Satan, should fall away into fornication, he saith, “But this I say of
leave, not of command; but I would that all men were as I myself; but
each one hath his own proper gift from God; but one in this way, and
another in that.” <span id="fr_2227"></span>[2228](#fn_2227) You see
that wedded chastity also, and the marriage faith of the Christian bed,
is a “gift,” and this of God; so that, when as carnal lust exceeds
somewhat the measure of sensual intercourse, beyond what is necessary
for the begetting of children, this evil is not of marriage, but venial
by reason of the good of marriage. For not concerning marriage, which is
contracted for the begetting of children, and the faith of wedded
chastity, and the sacrament (indissoluble, so long as both live) of
matrimony, all which are good; but concerning that immoderate use of the
flesh, which is recognized in the weakness of married persons, and is
pardoned by the intervention of the good of marriage, the Apostle saith,
<span id="page_443">p. 443</span> <span id="v.iv.vi-Page_443"></span>“I
speak of leave, not of command.” Also, when he says, “The woman is
bound, so long as her husband lives: but, in case her husband shall have
died, she is set free: let her be married to whom she will, only in the
Lord: but she shall be more blessed, if she shall have so continued,
according to my counsel;” <span id="fr_2228"></span>[2229](#fn_2228) he
shows sufficiently that a faithful woman is blessed in the Lord, even
when she marries a second time after the death of her husband, but that
a widow is more blessed in the same Lord; that is, to speak not only in
the words, but by instances also, of the Scriptures, that Ruth is
blessed, but that Anna is more blessed.
