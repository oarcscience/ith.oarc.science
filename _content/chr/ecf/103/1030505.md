<span id="v.i.xxii-p1"></span> 22. I say not, therefore, with what
error, but with what utter madness, do the Manichees attribute our flesh
to some, I know not what, fabled “race of darkness,” <span
id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881) which they will have hath had its
own nature without any beginning ever evil: whereas the true teacher
exhorts men to love their own wives by the pattern of their own flesh,
and exhorts them unto this very thing by the pattern also of Christ and
the Church. Lastly, we must call to mind the whole place itself of the
Epistle of the Apostle, relating greatly unto the matter in hand.
“Husbands,” saith he, “love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church,
and delivered Himself up for it, that He might sanctify it, cleansing it
by the laver of the water in the word: that He might set forth unto
Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such
thing, but that it may be holy and unspotted. So,” saith he, “husbands
also ought to love their own wives, as their own bodies. Whoso loveth
his own wife, loveth himself.” <span
id="fr_1882"></span>[1883](#fn_1882) Then he added, what we have already
made mention of, “For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth
it, and cherisheth it; as also Christ the Church.” <span
id="fr_1883"></span>[1884](#fn_1883) What saith the madness of most
impure impiety in answer to these things? What say ye in answer to these
things, ye Manichees; ye who wish to bring in upon us, as if out of the
Epistles of the Apostles, two natures without beginning, one of good,
the other of evil: and will not listen to the Epistles of the Apostles,
that they may correct you from that sacrilegious perverseness? As ye
read, “The flesh lusteth against the spirit,” <span
id="fr_1884"></span>[1885](#fn_1884) and, “There dwelleth not in my
flesh any good;” <span id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885) so read ye,
“No one ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as
also Christ the Church.” <span id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886) As
ye read, “I see another law in my members, opposed to the law of my
mind;” <span id="fr_1887"></span>[1888](#fn_1887) so read ye, “As Christ
loved the Church, so also ought men to love their own wives, as their
own bodies.” Be not ye crafty in the former witnesses of Holy Scripture,
and deaf in this latter, and ye shall be correct in both. For, if ye
receive the latter as right is, ye will endeavor to understand the
former also as truth is.
