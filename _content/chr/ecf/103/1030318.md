<span id="iv.ii.lxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 68.—The True Sense of the Passage
(</span>[1 Cor. 3.11-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011)<span
id="iv.ii.lxx-p1.2"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lxx-p1.3"></span>) About Those Who are Saved, Yet So as by
Fire.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxx-p2"></span>But as these most plain and unmistakeable
declarations of the apostles cannot be false, that obscure saying about
those who build upon the foundation, Christ, not gold, silver, and
precious stones, but wood, hay, and stubble (for it is these who, it is
said, shall be saved, yet so as by fire, the merit of the foundation
saving them <span id="fr_1220"></span>[1221](#fn_1220) ), must be so
interpreted as not to conflict with the plain statements quoted above.
Now wood, hay, and stubble may, without incongruity, be understood to
signify such an attachment to worldly things, however lawful these may
be in themselves, that they cannot be lost without grief of mind. And
though this grief burns, yet if Christ hold the place of foundation in
the heart,—that is, if nothing be preferred to Him, and if the man,
though burning with grief, is yet more willing to lose the things he
loves so much than to lose Christ,—he is saved by fire. If, however, in
time of temptation, he prefer to hold by temporal and earthly things
rather than by Christ, he has not Christ as his foundation; for he puts
earthly things in the first place, and in a building nothing comes
before the foundation. Again, the fire of which the apostle speaks in
this place must be such a fire as both men are made to pass through,
that is, both the man who builds upon the foundation, gold, silver,
precious stones, and the man who builds wood, hay, stubble. For he
immediately adds: “The fire shall try every man’s work, of what sort it
is. If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall
receive a reward. If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer
loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.” <span
id="fr_1221"></span>[1222](#fn_1221) The fire then shall prove, not the
work of one of them only, but of both. Now the trial of adversity is a
kind of fire which is plainly spoken of in another place: “The furnace
proveth the potter’s vessels: and the furnace of adversity just
men.” <span id="fr_1222"></span>[1223](#fn_1222) And this fire does in
the course of this life act exactly in the way the apostle says. If it
come into contact with two believers, one “caring for the things that
belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord,” <span
id="fr_1223"></span>[1224](#fn_1223) that is, building upon Christ the
foundation, gold, silver, precious stones; the other “caring for the
things that are of the <span id="page_260">p. 260</span> <span
id="iv.ii.lxx-Page_260"></span>world, how he may please his wife,” <span
id="fr_1224"></span>[1225](#fn_1224) that is, building upon the same
foundation wood, hay, stubble,—the work of the former is not burned,
because he has not given his love to things whose loss can cause him
grief; but the work of the latter is burned, because things that are
enjoyed with desire cannot be lost without pain. But since, by our
supposition, even the latter prefers to lose these things rather than to
lose Christ, and since he does not desert Christ out of fear of losing
them, though he is grieved when he does lose them, he is saved, but it
is so as by fire; because the grief for what he loved and has lost burns
him. But it does not subvert nor consume him; for he is protected by his
immoveable and incorruptible foundation.
