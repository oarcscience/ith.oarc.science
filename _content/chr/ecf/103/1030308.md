<span id="iv.ii.lx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.lx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 58.—We Have No Certain Knowledge of
the Organization of the Angelic Society.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lx-p2"></span>Now, what the organization is of that
supremely happy society in heaven: what the differences of rank are,
which explain the fact that while all are called by the general name
*angels*, as we read in the Epistle to the Hebrews, “but to which of the
angels said God at any time, Sit on my right hand?” <span
id="fr_1194"></span>[1195](#fn_1194) (this form of expression being
evidently designed to embrace all the angels without exception), we yet
find that there are some called *archangels*; and whether the archangels
are the same as those called *hosts*, so that the expression, “Praise ye
Him, all His angels: praise ye Him, all His hosts,” <span
id="fr_1195"></span>[1196](#fn_1195) is the same as if it had been said,
“Praise ye Him, all His angels: praise ye Him, all His archangels;” and
what are the various significations of those four names under which the
apostle seems to embrace the whole heavenly company without exception,
“whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or
powers:” <span id="fr_1196"></span>[1197](#fn_1196) —let those who are
able answer these questions, if they can also prove their answers to be
true; but as for me, I confess my ignorance. I am not even certain upon
this point: whether the sun, and the moon, and all the stars, do not
form part of this same society, though many consider them merely
luminous bodies, without either sensation or intelligence.
