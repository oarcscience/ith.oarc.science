<span id="iv.ii.liii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 51.—All Men Born of Adam are Under
Condemnation, and Only If New Born in Christ are Freed from
Condemnation.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.liii-p2"></span>But what he says a little after,
“Therefore, as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to
condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came
upon all men unto justification of life,” <span
id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174) shows clearly enough that there is
no one born of Adam but is subject to condemnation, and that no one,
unless he be new born in Christ, is freed from condemnation.
