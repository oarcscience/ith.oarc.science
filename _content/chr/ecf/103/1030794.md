<span id="v.viii.xx-p1"></span> 19. Since the case is so, what is man,
while in this life he uses his own proper will, ere he choose and love
God, but unrighteous and ungodly? “What,” I say, “is man,” a creature
going astray from the Creator, unless his Creator “be mindful of
him,” <span id="fr_2682"></span>[2683](#fn_2682) and choose <span
id="fr_2683"></span>[2684](#fn_2683) him freely, and love <span
id="fr_2684"></span>[2685](#fn_2684) him freely? Because he is himself
not able to choose or love, unless being first chosen and loved he be
healed, because by choosing blindness he perceiveth not, and by loving
laziness is soon wearied. But perchance some man may say: In what manner
is it that God first chooses and loves unjust men, that He may justify
them, when it is written, “Thou hatest, Lord, all that work
iniquity?” <span id="fr_2685"></span>[2686](#fn_2685) In what way, think
we, but in a wonderful and ineffable manner? And yet even we are able to
conceive, that the good Physician both hates and loves the sick man:
hates him, because he is sick; loves him, that he may drive away his
sickness.
