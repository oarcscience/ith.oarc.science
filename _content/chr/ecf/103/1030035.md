<span id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—The Appearance in the
Bush.</span>

<span id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p2"></span>23. But when Moses was sent to lead the
children of Israel out of Egypt, it is written that the Lord appeared to
him thus: “Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the
priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back side of the desert,
and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the Angel of the
Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire, out of the midst of a bush;
and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was
not consumed. And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great
sight, why the bush is not burnt. And when the Lord saw that he turned
aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and
said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob.” <span id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287) He is
here also first called the Angel of the Lord, and then God. Was an
angel, then, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob? Therefore He may be rightly understood to be the Saviour Himself,
of whom the apostle says, “Whose are the fathers, and of whom as
concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for
ever.” <span id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288) He, therefore, “who is
over all, God blessed for ever,” is not unreasonably here understood
also to be Himself the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob. But why is He previously called the Angel of the Lord, when He
appeared in a flame of fire out of the bush? Was it because it was one
of many angels, who by an economy \[or arrangement\] bare the person of
his Lord? or was something of the creature assumed by Him in order to
bring about a visible appearance for the business in hand, and that
words might thence be audibly uttered, whereby the presence of the Lord
might be shown, in such way as was fitting, to the corporeal senses of
man, by means of the creature made subject? For if he was one of the
angels, who could easily affirm whether it was the person of the Son
which was imposed upon him to announce, or that of the Holy Spirit, or
that of God the Father, or altogether of the Trinity itself, who is the
one and only God, in order that he might say, “I am the God of Abraham,
and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?” For we cannot say that the
Son of God is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob, and that the Father is not; nor will any one dare to deny that
either the Holy Spirit, or the Trinity itself, whom we believe and
understand to be the one God, is the God of Abraham, and the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For he who is not God, is not the God of
those fathers. Furthermore, if not only the Father is God, as all, even
heretics, admit; but also the Son, which, whether they will or not, they
are compelled to acknowledge, since the apostle says, “Who is over all,
God blessed for ever;” and the Holy Spirit, since the same apostle says,
“Therefore glorify God in your body;” when he had said above, “Know ye
not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you,
which ye have of God?” <span id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289) and these
three are one God, as catholic soundness believes: it is not
sufficiently apparent which person of the Trinity that angel bare, if he
was one of the rest of the angels, and whether any person, and not
rather that of the Trinity itself. But if the creature was assumed for
the purpose of the business in hand, whereby both to appear to human
eyes, and to sound in human ears, and to be called the Angel of the
Lord, and the Lord, and God; then cannot God here be understood to be
the Father, but either the Son or the Holy Spirit. Although I cannot
call to mind that the Holy Spirit is anywhere else called an angel,
which yet may be understood from His work; for it is said of Him, “And
He will show you <span id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290) things to
come;” <span id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291) and “angel” in Greek is
certainly equivalent to “messenger” <span
id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292) in Latin: but we read most evidently
of the Lord Jesus Christ in the prophet, that He is <span
id="page_49">p. 49</span> <span id="iv.i.iv.xiv-Page_49"></span>called
“the Angel of Great Counsel,” <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293)
while both the Holy Spirit and the Son of God is God and Lord of the
angels.
