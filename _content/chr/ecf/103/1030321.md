id="iv.ii.lxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 71.—The Daily Prayer of the
Believer Makes Satisfaction for the Trivial Sins that Daily Stain His
Life.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.lxxiii-p2"></span>Now the daily prayer of the believer
makes satisfaction for those daily sins of a momentary and trivial kind
which are necessary incidents of this life. For he can say, “Our Father
which art in heaven,” <span id="fr_1228"></span>[1229](#fn_1228) seeing
that to such a Father he is now born again of water and of the
Spirit. <span id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229) And this prayer
certainly takes away the very small sins of daily life. It takes away
also those which at one time made the life of the believer very wicked,
but which, now that he is changed for the better by repentance, he has
given up, provided that as truly as he says, “Forgive us our debts” (for
there is no want of debts to be forgiven), so truly does he say, “as we
forgive our debtors;” <span id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230) that
is, provided he does what he says he does: for to forgive a man who asks
for pardon, is really to give alms.
