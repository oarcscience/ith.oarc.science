<span id="iv.vii.iv-p1"></span> 4. We do not bring in two Gods as some
do, who say, “God the Father and God the Son, but greater God the Father
and lesser God the Son.” They both are what? Two Gods? Thou blushest to
speak it, blush to believe it. Lord God the Father, thou sayest, and
Lord God the Son: and the Son Himself saith, “No man can serve two
Lords.” <span id="fr_1767"></span>[1768](#fn_1767) In His family shall
we be in such wise, that, like as in a great house where there is the
father of a family and he hath a son, so we should say, the greater
Lord, the lesser Lord? Shrink from such a thought. If ye make to
yourselves such like in your heart, ye set up idols in the “one soul.”
Utterly repel it. First believe, then understand. Now to whom God gives
that when he has believed he soon understands; that is God’s gift, not
human frailness. Still, if ye do not yet understand, believe: One God
the Father, God Christ the Son of God. Both are what? One God. And how
are both said to be One God? How? Dost thou marvel? In the Acts of the
Apostles, “There was,” it says, “in the believers, one soul and one
heart.” <span id="fr_1768"></span>[1769](#fn_1768) There were many
souls, faith had made them one. So many thousands of souls were there;
they loved each other, and many are one: they loved God in the fire of
charity, and from being many they are come to the oneness of beauty. If
all those many souls the dearness of love <span
id="fr_1769"></span>[1770](#fn_1769) made one soul, what must be the
dearness of love in God, where is no diversity, but entire equality! If
on earth and among men there could be so great charity as of so many
souls to make one soul, where Father from Son, Son from Father, hath
been ever inseparable, could They both be other than One God? Only,
those souls might be called both many souls and one soul; but God, in
Whom is ineffable and highest conjunction, may be called One God, not
two Gods.
