<span id="v.vii.xxviii-p1"></span> 27. As it is, however, they, against
the Apostle of Christ, recite a Gospel of Christ. For so marvellous are
the works of the sluggards, hindered that they want to have that very
thing by Gospel, which the Apostle enjoined and did on purpose that the
Gospel itself should not be hindered. And yet, if from the very words of
the Gospel we should compel them to live agreeably with their way of
understanding it, they will be the first to endeavor to persuade us how
they are not to be understood so as they do understand them. For
certainly, they say that they therefore ought not to work, for that the
birds of the air neither sow nor reap, of which the Lord hath given us a
similitude that we should take no thought about such necessaries. Then
why do they not attend to that which follows? For it is not only said,
that “they sow not, neither reap;” <span
id="fr_2564"></span>[2565](#fn_2564) but there is added, “nor gather in
apothecas.” Now “apothecæ” may be called either “barns,” or word for
word, “repositories.” Then why do these persons want to have idle hands
and full repositories? Why do they lay by and keep what they receive of
the labors of others, that thereof may be every day somewhat
forthcoming? Why, in short, do they grind and cook? For the birds do not
this. Or, if they find some whom they may persuade to this work also,
namely, to bring unto them day by day viands ready made; at least their
water they either fetch them from springs, or from cisterns and wells
draw and set it by: this the fowls do not. But if so please them, let it
be the study of good believers and most devoted subjects of the Eternal
King, to carry their service to His most valiant soldiers even to that
length, that they shall not be forced even to fill a vessel of water for
themselves, if now-a-days people have surpassed even them which at that
time were at Jerusalem, in a new grade of righteousness, stepping out
beyond them. To them, namely, by reason of famine being imminent, and
foretold by the Prophets which were at that time, <span
id="fr_2565"></span>[2566](#fn_2565) good believers sent out of Greece
supplies of corn; of which I suppose they made them bread, or at least
procured to be made; which thing the birds do not. But if now-a-days
these persons, as I began to say, have surpassed these in some grade of
righteousness, and do altogether in things pertaining to the maintenance
of this life, as do the birds; let them show us men doing such service
unto birds as they wish to be done unto them, except indeed birds caught
and caged because they are not trusted, lest if they fly they come not
back: and yet these would rather enjoy liberty and receive from the
fields what is enough, than take their food by men laid before them and
made ready.
