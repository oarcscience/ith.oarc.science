<span id="v.viii.xvi-p1"></span> 15. For, as the Divine utterances
testify, “God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and
God dwelleth in him.” <span id="fr_2666"></span>[2667](#fn_2666) Whoso
therefore contends that love of God may be had without aid of God, what
else does he contend, but that God may be had without God? Now what
Christian would say this, which no madman would venture to say?
Therefore in the Apostle, true, pious, faithful patience, saith
exultingly, and by the mouth of the Saints; “Who shall separate us from
the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For Thy sake
we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the
slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through
Him that loved us:” not through ourselves, but, “through Him that loved
us.” <span id="fr_2667"></span>[2668](#fn_2667) And then he goes on and
adds; “For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” This is that
“love of God” which “is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit
which is given unto us.” But the concupiscence of the bad, by reason of
which there is in them a false patience, “is not of the Father,” <span
id="fr_2668"></span>[2669](#fn_2668) as saith the Apostle John, but is
of the world.
