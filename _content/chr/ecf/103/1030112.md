<span id="iv.i.x-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="iv.i.x-p3"></span>Explains and proves that not only the Father
is not greater than the Son, but neither are both together anything
greater than the Holy Spirit, nor any two together in the same trinity
anything greater than one, nor all three together anything greater than
each severally. It is then shown how the nature itself of God may be
understood from our understanding of truth, and from our knowledge of
the supreme good, and from the innate love of righteousness, whereby a
righteous soul is loved even by a soul that is itself not yet righteous.
But it is urged above all, that the knowledge of God is to be sought by
love, which God is said to be in the Scriptures; and in this love is
also pointed out the existence of some trace of a trinity.
