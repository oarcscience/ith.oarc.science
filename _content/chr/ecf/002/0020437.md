##### <span id="vi.iv.viii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—On the Causes of Doubt or Assent.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vii-p1"></span>The causes productive of scepticism
are two things principally. One is the changefulness and instability of
the human mind, whose nature it is to generate dissent, either that of
one with another, or that of people with themselves. And the second is
the discrepancy which is in things; which, as to be expected, is
calculated to be productive of scepticism.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vii-p2"></span>For, being unable either to believe
in all views, on account of their conflicting nature; or to disbelieve
all, because that which says that all are untrustworthy is included in
the number of those that are so; or to believe some and disbelieve
others on account of the equipoise, we are led to scepticism.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vii-p3"></span>But among the principal causes of
scepticism is the instability of the mind, which is productive of
dissent. And dissent is the proximate cause of doubt. Whence life is
full of tribunals and councils; and, in fine, of selection in what is
said to be good and bad; which are the signs of a mind in doubt, and
halting through feebleness on account of conflicting matters. And there
are libraries full of books, <span id="fr_3708"></span>[3709](#fn_3708)
and compilations and treatises of those who differ in dogmas, and are
confident that they themselves know the truth that there is in things.
