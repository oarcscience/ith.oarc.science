##### <span id="vi.iii.iii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Behaviour in the Baths.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.v-p1"></span>And of what sort are their baths?
Houses skilfully constructed, compact, portable, transparent, covered
with fine linen. And gold-plated chairs, and silver ones, too, and ten
thousand vessels of gold and silver, some for drinking, some for eating,
some for bathing, are carried about with them. Besides these, there are
even braziers of coals; for they have arrived at such a pitch of
self-indulgence, that they sup and get drunk while bathing. And articles
of silver with which they make a show, they ostentatiously set out in
the baths, and thus display perchance their wealth out of excessive
pride, but chiefly the capricious ignorance, through which they brand
effeminate men, who have been vanquished by women; proving at least that
they themselves cannot meet and cannot sweat without a multitude of
vessels, although poor women who have no display equally enjoy their
baths. The dirt of wealth, then, has an abundant covering of censure.
With this, as with a bait, they hook the miserable creatures that gape
at the glitter of gold. For dazzling thus those fond of display, they
artfully try to win the admiration of their lovers, who after a little
insult them naked. They will scarce strip before their own husbands
affecting a plausible pretence of modesty; but any others who wish, may
see them at home shut up naked in their baths. For there they are not
ashamed to strip before spectators, as if exposing their persons for
sale. But Hesiod advises

> <span id="vi.iii.iii.v-p1.1"></span> “Not to wash the skin in the
> women’s bath.” <span id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626)  

<span id="vi.iii.iii.v-p3"></span>The baths are opened promiscuously to
men and women; and there they strip for licentious indulgence (for from
looking, men get to loving), as if their modesty had been washed away in
the bath. <span id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627) Those who have not
become utterly destitute of modesty shut out strangers; but bathe with
their own servants, and strip naked before their slaves, and are rubbed
by them; giving to the crouching menial liberty to lust, by permitting
fearless handling. For those who are introduced before their naked
mistresses while in the bath, study to strip themselves in order to
audacity in lust, casting off fear in consequence of the wicked custom.
The ancient athletes, <span id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628) ashamed
to exhibit a man naked, preserved their modesty by going through the
contest in drawers; but these women, divesting themselves of their
modesty along with their tunic, wish to appear beautiful, but contrary
to their wish are simply proved to be wicked. <span
id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629) For through the body itself the
wantonness of lust shines clearly; as in the case of dropsical people,
the water covered by the skin. Disease in both is known from the look.
Men, therefore, affording to women a noble example of truth, ought to be
ashamed at their stripping before them, and guard against these
dangerous sights; “for he who has looked curiously,” it is said, “hath
sinned already.” <span id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630) At home,
therefore, they ought to regard with modesty parents and domestics; in
the ways, those they meet; in the baths, women; in solitude, themselves;
and everywhere the Word, who is everywhere, “and without Him was not
anything.” <span id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631) For so only shall
one remain without falling, if he regard God as ever present with him.
