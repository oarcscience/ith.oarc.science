##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Cain’s Family and Their Inventions.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxx-p1"></span>Cain also himself had a son, whose
name was Enoch; and he built a city, which he called by the name of his
son, Enoch. From that time was there made a beginning of the building of
cities, and this before the flood; not as Homer falsely says: <span
id="fr_609"></span>[610](#fn_609) —

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxx-p2.1"></span> “Not yet had men a city built.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxx-p3"></span>And to Enoch was born a son, by name
Gaidad; who begat a son called Meel; and Meel begat Mathusala; and
Mathusala, Lamech. And Lamech took unto him two wives, whose names were
Adah and Zillah. At that time there was made a beginning of polygamy,
and also of music. For Lamech had three sons: Jabal, Jubal, Tubal. And
Jabal became a keeper of cattle, and dwelt in tents; but Jubal is he who
made known the psaltery and the harp; and Tubal became a smith, a forger
in brass and iron. So far the seed of Cain is registered; and for the
rest, the seed of his line has sunk into oblivion, on account of his
fratricide of his brother. And, in place of Abel, God granted to Eve to
conceive and bear a son, who was called Seth; from whom the remainder of
the human race proceeds until now. And to those who desire to be
informed regarding all generations, it is easy to give explanations by
means of the holy Scriptures. For, as we have already mentioned, this
subject, the order of the genealogy of man, has been partly handled by
us in another discourse, in the first book of *The History.* <span
id="fr_610"></span>[611](#fn_610) And all these things the Holy Spirit
teaches us, who speaks through Moses and the rest of the prophets, so
that the writings which belong to us godly people are more ancient, yea,
and are shown to be more truthful, than all writers and poets. But also,
concerning music, some have fabled that Apollo was the inventor, and
others say that Orpheus discovered the art of music from the sweet
voices of the birds. Their story is shown to be empty and vain, for
these inventors lived many years after the flood. And what relates to
Noah, who is called by some Deucalion, has been explained by us in the
book before mentioned, and which, if you wish it, you are at liberty to
read.
