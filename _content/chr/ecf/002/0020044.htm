<p><a name="iii.ii.viii-p1"></A>But men form the material (<span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ii.viii-p1.1"></A>&#8017;&#960;&#8057;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>) of their apostasy. For, having shown them a plan of the position of the stars, like dice-players, they introduced Fate, a flagrant injustice. For the judge and the judged are made so by Fate; the murderers and the murdered, the wealthy and the needy, are the offspring of the same Fate; and every nativity is regarded as a theatrical entertainment by those beings of whom Homer says,&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.viii-p1.2"></A> &#8220;Among the gods<br>  Rose laughter irrepressible.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_441"></A><A HREF="#fn_441"><FONT SIZE="1">442</FONT></A>
<br>  </blockquote>  
<p class="continue"><a name="iii.ii.viii-p3"></A>But must not those who are spectators of single combats and are partisans on one side or the other, and he who marries and is a p&aelig;derast and an adulterer, who laughs and is angry, who flees and is wounded, be regarded as mortals? For, by whatever actions they manifest to men their characters, by these they prompt their hearers to copy their example. And are not the demons themselves, with Zeus at their head, subjected to Fate, being overpowered by the same passions as men? And, besides, how are those beings to be worshipped among whom there exists such a great contrariety of opinions? For Rhea, whom the inhabitants of the Phrygian mountains call Cybele, enacted emasculation on account of Attis, of whom she was enamoured; but Aphrodit&eacute; is delighted with conjugal embraces. Artemis is a poisoner; Apollo heals diseases. And after the decapitation of the Gorgon, the beloved of Poseidon, whence sprang the horse Pegasus and Chrysaor, Athen&eacute; and Asclepios divided between them the drops of blood; and, while he saved men&#146;s lives by means of them, she, by the same blood, became a homicide and the instigator of wars. From regard to her reputation, as it appears to me, the Athenians attributed to the earth the son born of her connection with Heph&aelig;stos, that Athen&eacute; might not be thought to be deprived of her virility by Heph&aelig;stos, as Atalanta by Meleager. This limping manufacturer of buckles and earrings, as is likely, deceived the motherless child and orphan with these girlish ornaments. Poseidon frequents the seas; Ares delights in wars; Apollo is a player on the cithara; Dionysus is absolute sovereign of the Thebans; Kronos is a tyrannicide; Zeus has intercourse with his own daughter, who becomes pregnant by him. I may instance, too, Eleusis, and the mystic Dragon, and Orpheus, who says,&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.viii-p3.1"></A> &#8220;Close the gates against the profane!&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>  
<p class="continue"><a name="iii.ii.viii-p4"></A>A&iuml;doneus carries off Kor&eacute;, and his deeds have been made into mysteries; Demeter bewails her daughter, and some persons are deceived by the Athenians. In the precincts of the temple of the son of Leto is a spot called Omphalos; but Omphalos is the burial-place of Dionysus. You now I laud, O Daphne!&#8212;by conquering the incontinence of Apollo, you disproved his power of vaticination; for, not foreseeing what would occur to you,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_442"></A><A HREF="#fn_442"><FONT SIZE="1">443</FONT></A>
 he derived no advantage from his art. Let the far-shooting god tell me how Zephyrus slew Hyacinthus. Zephyrus conquered him; and in accordance with the saying of the tragic poet,&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.viii-p5.1"></A> &#8220;A breeze is the most honourable chariot of the gods,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_443"></A><A HREF="#fn_443"><FONT SIZE="1">444</FONT></A>
&#8212;<br>   </blockquote>  
<p class="continue"><a name="iii.ii.viii-p7"></A>conquered by a slight breeze, Apollo lost his beloved.</p>
