##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—The World Compared to the Sea.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiv-p1"></span>Consider, further, their variety, and
diverse beauty, and multitude, and how through them resurrection is
exhibited, for a pattern of the resurrection of all men which is to be.
For who that considers it will not marvel that a fig-tree is produced
from a fig-seed, or that very huge trees grow from the other very little
seeds? And we say that the world resembles the sea. For as the sea, if
it had not had the influx and supply of the rivers and fountains to
nourish it, would long since have been parched by reason of its
saltness; so also the world, if it had not had the law of God and the
prophets flowing and welling up sweetness, and compassion, and
righteousness, and the doctrine of the holy commandments of God, would
long ere now have come to ruin, by reason of the wickedness and sin
which abound in it. And as in the sea there are islands, some of them
habitable, and well-watered, and fruitful, with havens and harbours in
which the storm-tossed may find refuge,—so God has given to the world
which is driven and tempest-tossed by sins, assemblies <span
id="fr_578"></span>[579](#fn_578) —we mean holy churches <span
id="fr_579"></span>[580](#fn_579) —in which survive the doctrines of the
truth, as in the island-harbours of good anchorage; and into these run
those who desire to be saved, being lovers of the truth, and wishing to
escape the wrath and judgment of God. And as, again, there are other
islands, rocky and without water, and barren, and infested by wild
beasts, and uninhabitable, and serving only to injure navigators and the
storm-tossed, on which ships are wrecked, and those driven among them
perish,—so there are doctrines of error—I mean heresies <span
id="fr_580"></span>[581](#fn_580) —which destroy those who approach
them. For they are not guided by the word of truth; but as pirates, when
they have filled their vessels, <span id="fr_581"></span>[582](#fn_581)
drive them on the fore-mentioned places, that they may spoil them: so
also it happens in the case of those who err from the truth, that they
are all totally ruined by their error.
