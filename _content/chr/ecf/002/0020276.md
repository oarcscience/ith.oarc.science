##### <span id="vi.iii.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XII.—On Shoes.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.xii-p1"></span>Women fond of display act in the same
manner with regard to shoes, showing also in this matter great
luxuriousness. Base, in truth, are those sandals on which golden
ornaments are fastened; but they are thought worth having nails driven
into the soles in winding rows. Many, too, carve on them <span
id="fr_1549"></span>[1550](#fn_1549) amorous embraces, as if they would
by their walk communicate to the earth harmonious movement, and impress
on it the wantonness of their spirit. Farewell, therefore, must be
bidden to gold-plated and jewelled mischievous devices of sandals, and
Attic and Sicyonian half-boots, and Persian and Tyrrhenian buskins; and
setting before us the right aim, as is the habit with our truth, we are
bound to select what is in accordance with nature.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.xii-p3"></span>For the use of shoes is partly for
covering, partly for defence in case of stumbling against objects, and
for saving the sole of the foot from the roughness of hilly paths.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.xii-p4"></span>Women are to be allowed a white shoe,
except when on a journey, and then a greased shoe must be used. When on
a journey, they require nailed shoes. Further, they ought for the most
part to wear shoes; for it is not suitable for the foot to be shown
naked: besides, woman is a tender thing, easily hurt. But for a man bare
feet are quite in keeping, except when he is on military service. “For
being shod is near neighbour to being bound.” <span
id="fr_1550"></span>[1551](#fn_1550)

<span id="vi.iii.ii.xii-p6"></span>To go with bare feet is most suitable
for exercise, and best adapted for health and ease, unless where
necessity prevents. But if we are not on a journey, and cannot endure
bare feet, we may use slippers or white shoes; dusty-foots <span
id="fr_1551"></span>[1552](#fn_1551) the Attics called them, on account
of their bringing the feet near the dust, as I think. As a witness for
simplicity in shoes let John suffice, who avowed that “he was not worthy
to unloose the latchet of the Lord’s shoes.” <span
id="fr_1552"></span>[1553](#fn_1552) For he who exhibited to the Hebrews
the type of the true philosophy wore no elaborate shoes. What else this
may imply, will be shown elsewhere.
