##### <span id="iv.ii.i.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Attributes of God.

<span id="iv.ii.i.iv-p1"></span>And He is without beginning, because He
is unbegotten; and He is unchangeable, because He is immortal. And he is
called God \[<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.i.iv-p1.1"></span>Θεός</span>\] on account of His having
placed \[<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.i.iv-p1.2"></span>τεθεικέναι</span>\] all things on security
afforded by Himself; and on account of \[<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.i.iv-p1.3"></span>θέειν</span>\], for <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.ii.i.iv-p1.4"></span>θέειν</span> means
running, and moving, and being active, and nourishing, and foreseeing,
and governing, and making all things alive. But he is Lord, because He
rules over the universe; Father, because he is before all things;
Fashioner and Maker, because He is creator and maker of the universe;
the Highest, because of His being above all; and Almighty, because He
Himself rules and embraces all. For the heights of heaven, and the
depths of the abysses, and the ends of the earth, are in His hand, and
there is no place of His rest. For the heavens are His work, the earth
is His creation, the sea is His handiwork; man is His formation and His
image; sun, moon, and stars are His elements, made for signs, and
seasons, and days, and years, that they may serve and be slaves to man;
and all things God has made out of things that were not <span
id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530) into things that are, in order that
through His works His greatness may be known and understood.
