##### <span id="vi.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The Poets Also Bear Testimony to the Truth.

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p1"></span>Let poetry also approach to us (for
philosophy alone will not suffice): poetry which is wholly occupied with
falsehood—which scarcely will make confession of the truth, but will
rather own to God its deviations into fable. Let whoever of those poets
chooses advance first. Aratus considers that the power of God pervades
all things:—

> <span id="vi.ii.vii-p1.1"></span> “That all may be secure,  
> Him ever they propitiate first and last,  
> Hail, Father I great marvel, great gain to man.”  

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p2"></span>Thus also the Ascræan Hesiod dimly speaks
of God:—

> <span id="vi.ii.vii-p2.1"></span> “For He is the King of all, and
> monarch  
> Of the immortals; and there is none that may vie  
> with Him in power.”  

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p3"></span>Also on the stage they reveal the truth:—

> <span id="vi.ii.vii-p3.1"></span> “Look on the ether and heaven, and
> regard that as God,”  

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p4"></span>says Euripides. And Sophocles, the son of
Sophilus, says:—

> <span id="vi.ii.vii-p4.1"></span> “One, in truth, one is God,  
> Who made both heaven and the far-stretching earth,  
> And ocean’s blue wave, and the mighty winds;  
> But many of us mortals, deceived in heart,  
> Have set up for ourselves, as a consolation in our afflictions,  
> Images of the gods of stone, or wood, or brass,  
> Or gold, or ivory;  
> And, appointing to those sacrifices and vain festal assemblages,  
> Are accustomed thus to practice religion.”  

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p5"></span> <span id="page_193">p. 193</span> <span
id="vi.ii.vii-Page_193"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p6"></span>In this venturous manner has he on the
stage brought truth before the spectators. But the Thracian Orpheus, the
son of Œagrus, hierophant and poet at once, after his exposition of the
orgies, and his theology of idols, introduces a palinode of truth with
true solemnity, though tardily singing the strain:—

> <span id="vi.ii.vii-p6.1"></span> “I shall utter to whom it is lawful;
> but let the doors be closed,  
> Nevertheless, against all the profane. But do thou hear,  
> O Musæus, offspring of the light-bringing moon,  
> For I will declare what is true. And let not these things  
> Which once appeared in your breast rob you of dear life;  
> But looking to the divine word, apply yourself to it,  
> Keeping right *the seat of intellect and feeling;* and walk well  
> In the straight path, and to the immortal King of the universe alone  
> Direct your gaze.”  

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p7"></span>Then proceeding, he clearly adds:—

> <span id="vi.ii.vii-p7.1"></span> “He is one, self-proceeding; and
> from Him alone all things proceed,  
> And in them He Himself exerts his activity: no mortal  
> Beholds Him, but He beholds all.”  

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p8"></span>Thus far Orpheus at last understood that
he had been in error:—

> <span id="vi.ii.vii-p8.1"></span> “But linger no longer, O man, endued
> with varied wisdom;  
> But turn and retrace your steps, and propitiate God.”  

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p9"></span>For if, at the most, the Greeks, having
received certain scintillations of the divine word, have given forth
some utterances of truth, they bear indeed witness that the force of
truth is not hidden, and at the same time expose their own weakness in
not having arrived at the end. For I think it has now become evident to
all, that those who do or speak aught without the word of truth are like
people compelled to walk without feet. Let the strictures on your gods,
which the poets, impelled by the force of truth, introduce in their
comedies, shame you into salvation. Menander, for instance, the comic
poet, in his drama of the *Charioteer,* says:—

> <span id="vi.ii.vii-p9.1"></span> “No God pleases me that goes about  
> With an old woman, and enters houses  
> Carrying a trencher.”  

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p10"></span>For such are the begging priests of
Cybele. Hence Antisthenes replies appropriately to their request for
alms:—

> <span id="vi.ii.vii-p10.1"></span> “I do not maintain the mother of
> the gods,  
> For the gods maintain her.”  

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p11"></span>Again, the same writer of comedy,
expressing his dissatisfaction with the common usages, tries to expose
the impious arrogance of the prevailing error in the drama of the
*Priestess,* sagely declaring:—

> <span id="vi.ii.vii-p11.1"></span> “If a man drags the Deity  
> Whither he will by the sound of cymbals,  
> He that does this is greater than the Deity;  
> But these are the instruments of audacity and means of living  
> Invented by men.”  

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p12"></span>And not only Menander, but Homer also,
and Euripides, and other poets in great numbers, expose your gods, and
are wont to rate them, and that soundly too. For instance, they call
Aphrodite dog-fly, and Hephæstus a cripple. Helen says to Aphrodite:—

> <span id="vi.ii.vii-p12.1"></span> “Thy godship abdicate!  
> Renounce Olympus!” <span id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925)  

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p14"></span>And of Dionysus, Homer writes without
reserve:—

> <span id="vi.ii.vii-p14.1"></span> “He, mid their frantic orgies, in
> the groves  
> Of lovely Nyssa, put to shameful rout  
> The youthful Bacchus’ nurses; they in fear,  
> Dropped each her thyrsus, scattered by the hand  
> Of fierce Lycurgus, with an ox-goad armed.” <span
> id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926)  

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p16"></span>Worthy truly of the Socratic school is
Euripides, who fixes his eye on truth, and despises the spectators of
his plays. On one occasion, Apollo,

> <span id="vi.ii.vii-p16.1"></span> “Who inhabits the sanctuary that is
> in the middle of the earth,  
> Dispensing most certain oracles to mortals,”  

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p17"></span>is thus exposed:—

> <span id="vi.ii.vii-p17.1"></span> “It was in obedience to him that I
> killed her who brought me forth;  
> Him do you regard as stained with guilt—put him to death;  
> It was he that sinned, not I, uninstructed as I was  
> In right and justice.” <span id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927)  

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p19"></span>He introduces Heracles, at one time mad,
at another drunk and gluttonous. How should he not so represent the god
who, when entertained as a guest, ate green figs to flesh, uttering
discordant howls, that even his barbarian host remarked it? In his drama
of *Ion,* too, he barefacedly brings the gods on the stage:—

> <span id="vi.ii.vii-p19.1"></span> “How, then, is it right for you,
> who have given laws to mortals,  
> To be yourselves guilty of wrong?  
> And if—what will never take place, yet I will state the supposition—  
> You will give satisfaction to men for your adulteries,  
> You, Poseidon, and you, Zeus, the ruler of heaven,—  
> You will, in order to make recompense for your misdeeds,  
> Have to empty your temples.” <span id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928)
