<span id="ii.iv.i"></span>

#### <span id="ii.iv.i-p0.1"></span>Similitude First. <span id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243)

##### <span id="ii.iv.i-p3.2"></span>As in This World We Have No Abiding City, We Ought to Seek One to Come.

<span id="ii.iv.i-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.i-p4.1"></span>He</span> says to me, “You know that you who
are the servants of God dwell in a strange land; for your city is far
away from this one. <span id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244) If, then,”
he continues, “you know your city in which you are to dwell, why do ye
here provide lands, and make expensive preparations, and accumulate
dwellings and useless buildings? He who makes such preparations for this
city cannot return again to his own. Oh foolish, and unstable, and
miserable man! Dost thou not understand that all these things belong to
another, and are under the power of another? for the lord of this city
will say, ‘I do not wish thee to dwell in my city; but depart from this
city, because thou obeyest not my laws.’ Thou, therefore, although
having fields and houses, and many other things, when cast out by him,
what wilt thou do with thy land, and house, and other possessions which
thou hast gathered to thyself? For the lord of this country justly says
to thee, ‘Either obey my laws or depart from my dominion.’ What, then,
dost thou intend to do, having a law in thine own city, on account of
thy lands, and the rest of thy possessions? <span
id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245) Thou shalt altogether deny thy law,
and walk according to the law of this city. See lest it be to thy hurt
to deny thy law; <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246) for if thou
shalt desire to return to thy city, thou wilt not be received, because
thou hast denied the law of thy city, but wilt be excluded from it. Have
a care, therefore: as one living in a foreign land, make no further
preparations for thyself than such merely as may be sufficient; and be
ready, when the master of this city shall come to cast thee out for
disobeying his law, to leave his city, and to depart to thine own, and
to obey thine own law without being exposed to annoyance, but in great
joy. Have a care, then, ye who serve the Lord, and have Him in your
heart, that ye work the works of God, remembering His commandments and
promises which He promised, and believe that He will bring them to pass
if His commandments be observed. Instead of lands, therefore, buy
afflicted souls, according as each one is able, and visit <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247) widows and orphans, and do not
overlook them; and spend your wealth and all your preparations, which ye
received from the Lord, upon such lands and houses. For to this end did
the Master make you rich, that you might perform these services unto
Him; and it is much better to purchase such lands, and possessions, and
houses, as you will find in your own city, when you come to reside in
it. This is a noble and sacred expenditure, attended neither with sorrow
nor fear, but with joy. Do not practice the expenditure <span
id="page_32">p. 32</span> <span id="ii.iv.i-Page_32"></span>of the
heathen, <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248) for it is injurious to
you who are the servants of God; but practice an expenditure of your
own, in which ye can rejoice; and do not corrupt <span
id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249) nor touch what is another’s nor covet
it, for it is an evil thing to covet the goods of other men; but work
thine own work, and thou wilt be saved.”

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_243"></span>[31:244](0020023.htm#fr_243) <span
id="ii.iv.i-p0.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.i-p1"></span> \[We have seen in Justin and Irenæus what
seem to us an overstrained allegorizing, and more will be encountered in
Origen. On this whole subject, however, as it struck the Oriental and
primitive instincts, take the following very illustrative remarks,
attributed to *Hartley of Winwich:*—

<span id="ii.iv.i-p2"></span>“Nature, in its proper order, is the book
of God, and exhibits spiritual things in material forms. The knowledge
of *correspondences* being so little understood, is one main cause of
the obscurity of the Scriptures of the Old Testament, *which were
chiefly written by the rules of this science:* and not Scripture alone,
but man, also, as an image of the spiritual and natural worlds, contains
in himself the correspondences of both: of the former, in his interior,
and of the latter in his exterior or bodily, part, and so is called the
*microcosm*, or little world.”

<span id="ii.iv.i-p3"></span>Such texts as [Heb.
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024),
[1](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001)<span id="ii.iv.i-p3.1"></span> Cor.
ii. 13, 14, go far to explain to us the childlike faith of the Fathers.
See note on *Leighton’s St. Peter*, p. 238, vol. iii. Ed. Of William
West, B.A. 1870.\]

<span id="fn_244"></span>[31:245](0020023.htm#fr_244) <span
id="ii.iv.i-p4.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.i-p5"></span> \[[Heb. xiii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014)<span id="ii.iv.i-p5.1"></span> is
the text of this very beautiful chapter. But he original Greek of [Phil.
iii. 20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020)<span id="ii.iv.i-p5.2"></span>
seems, also, to be in the author’s mind. St. Paul addressed it to the
church of a Roman “colony,” whose *citizenship* was not Macedonian but
Roman: hence its beautiful propriety.\]

<span id="fn_245"></span>[31:246](0020023.htm#fr_245) <span
id="ii.iv.i-p5.3"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.i-p6"></span> This sentence may be also rendered thus,
giving <span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iv.i-p6.1"></span>ἕνεκεν</span>
the meaning of “as regards,” “respecting”—a usual enough signification:
“What then do you intend to do, as you have a law in your own city
regarding your lands and the rest of your possessions?” The Vatican
punctuates the passage so that it runs as follows: “What then will you
do, who have a law in your own city? Will you, on account of your land,
or any other of your preparations, be able to deny your law?” The
Vatican also omits several clauses that are in the Greek, down to “for
if thou shalt deny, and shalt desire to return,” etc.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[31:247](0020023.htm#fr_246) <span
id="ii.iv.i-p6.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.i-p7"></span> *See … law*, omitted in Lips. \[The <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iv.i-p7.1"></span>θρησκεία</span> of [Jas. i.
27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027)<span id="ii.iv.i-p7.2"></span>.\]

<span id="fn_247"></span>[31:248](0020023.htm#fr_247) <span
id="ii.iv.i-p7.3"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.i-p8"></span> The Vatican has: “Acquit widows, and do
justice to orphans.”

<span id="fn_248"></span>[32:249](0020023.htm#fr_248) <span
id="ii.iv.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.i-p9"></span> The Vatican renders, “Do not covet,
therefore, the riches of the heathen.” \[Here follows, in the Lambeth
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.i-p9.1"></span>ms.</span>, an allusion
to [Luke xix. 15](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#015)<span
id="ii.iv.i-p9.2"></span>, which Wake renders: “Trade with your own
riches.” See, also, [Luke xii. 33](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#033)<span
id="ii.iv.i-p9.3"></span>.\]

<span id="fn_249"></span>[32:250](0020023.htm#fr_249) <span
id="ii.iv.i-p9.4"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.i-p10"></span> The Vatican, rendering <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iv.i-p10.1"></span>παραχαράσσετε</span>,
*adulterare*, proceeds as if the reference were to adultery. “Neither
touch another man’s wife, nor lust after her, but desire your own work,
and you will be saved.”
