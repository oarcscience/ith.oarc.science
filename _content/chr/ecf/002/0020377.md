##### <span id="vi.iv.v.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—The Objects of Faith and Hope Perceived by the Mind Alone.

<span id="vi.iv.v.iii-p1"></span>For he who hopes, as he who believes,
sees intellectual objects and future things with the mind. If, then, we
affirm that aught is just, and affirm it to be good, and we also say
that truth is something, yet we have never seen any of such objects with
our eyes, but with our mind alone. Now the Word of God says, “I am the
truth.” <span id="fr_2975"></span>[2976](#fn_2975) The Word is then to
be contemplated by the mind. “Do you aver,” it was said, <span
id="fr_2976"></span>[2977](#fn_2976) “that there are any true
philosophers?” “Yes,” said I, “those who love to contemplate the truth.”
In the *Phœdrus* also, Plato, speaking of the truth, shows it as an
idea. Now an idea is a conception of God; and this the barbarians have
termed the Word of God. The words are as follow: “For one must then dare
to speak the truth, especially in speaking of the truth. For the essence
of the soul, being colourless, formless, and intangible, is visible only
to God, <span id="fr_2977"></span>[2978](#fn_2977) its guide.” Now the
Word issuing forth was the cause of creation; then also he generated
himself, “when the Word had become flesh,” <span
id="fr_2978"></span>[2979](#fn_2978) that He might be seen. The
righteous man will seek the discovery that flows from love, to which if
he hastes he prospers. For it is said, “To him that knocketh, it shall
be opened: ask, and it shall be given to you.” <span
id="fr_2979"></span>[2980](#fn_2979) “For the violent that storm the
kingdom” <span id="fr_2980"></span>[2981](#fn_2980) are not so in
disputatious speeches; but by continuance in a right life and unceasing
prayers, are said “to take it by force,” wiping away the blots left by
their previous sins.

> <span id="vi.iv.v.iii-p7.2"></span> “You may obtain wickedness, even
> in great abundance. <span id="fr_2981"></span>[2982](#fn_2981)  
> And him who toils God helps;  
> For the gifts of the Muses, hard to win,  
> Lie not before you, for any one to bear away.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.iii-p9"></span>The knowledge of ignorance is, then,
the first lesson in walking according to the Word. An ignorant man has
sought, and having sought, he finds the teacher; and finding has
believed, and believing has hoped; and henceforward having loved, is
assimilated to what was loved—endeavouring to be what he first loved.
Such is the method Socrates shows Alcibiades, who thus questions: “Do
you not think that I shall know about what is right otherwise?” “Yes, if
you have found out.” “But you don’t think I have found out?” “Certainly,
if you have sought.”

<span id="vi.iv.v.iii-p10"></span>“Then you don’t think that I have
sought?” “Yes, if you think you do not know.” <span
id="fr_2982"></span>[2983](#fn_2982) So with the lamps of the wise
virgins, lighted at night in the great darkness of ignorance, which the
Scripture signified by “night.” Wise souls, pure as virgins,
understanding themselves to be situated amidst the ignorance of the
world, kindle the light, and rouse the mind, and illumine the darkness,
and dispel ignorance, and seek truth, and await the appearance of the
Teacher.

> <span id="vi.iv.v.iii-p11.1"></span> “The mob, then,” said I, “cannot
> become philosopher.” <span id="fr_2983"></span>[2984](#fn_2983)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.iii-p13"></span>“Many rod-bearers there are, but few
Bacchi,” according to Plato. “For many are called, but few
chosen.” <span id="fr_2984"></span>[2985](#fn_2984) “Knowledge is not in
all,” <span id="fr_2985"></span>[2986](#fn_2985) says the apostle. “And
pray that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all
men have not faith.” <span id="fr_2986"></span>[2987](#fn_2986) And the
*Poetics* of Cleanthes, the Stoic, writes to the following effect:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.iii-p16.2"></span> “Look not to glory, wishing to be
> suddenly wise,  
> And fear not the undiscerning and rash opinion of the many;  
> For the multitude has not an intelligent, or wise, or right
> judgment,  
> And it is in few men that you will find this.” <span
> id="fr_2987"></span>[2988](#fn_2987)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.iii-p18"></span>And more sententiously the comic poet
briefly says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.iii-p18.1"></span> “It is a shame to judge of what
> is right by much noise.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.iii-p19"></span>For they heard, I think, that
excellent wisdom, which says to us, “Watch your opportunity in the midst
of the foolish, and in the midst of the intelligent continue.” <span
id="fr_2988"></span>[2989](#fn_2988) And again, “The wise will conceal
sense.” <span id="fr_2989"></span>[2990](#fn_2989) For the many demand
demonstration as a pledge of truth, not satisfied with the bare
salvation by faith.

> <span id="vi.iv.v.iii-p21.2"></span> “But it is strongly incumbent to
> disbelieve the dominant wicked,  
> And as is enjoined by the assurance of our muse,  
> Know by dissecting the utterance within your breast.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.iii-p22"></span>“For this is habitual to the wicked,”
says Empedocles, “to wish to overbear what is true by disbelieving it.”
And that our tenets are probable and worthy of belief, the Greeks shall
know, the point being more thoroughly investigated in what follows. For
we are taught what is like by what is like. For says Solomon, “Answer a
fool according to his folly.” <span id="fr_2990"></span>[2991](#fn_2990)
Wherefore also, to those that ask the wisdom that is with us, we are to
hold out things suitable, that with the greatest possible ease they may,
through their own ideas, be likely to arrive at faith in the truth. For
“I <span id="page_449">p. 449</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.iii-Page_449"></span>became all things to all men, that I
might gain all men.” <span id="fr_2991"></span>[2992](#fn_2991) Since
also “the rain” of the divine grace is sent down “on the just and the
unjust.” <span id="fr_2992"></span>[2993](#fn_2992) “Is He the God of
the Jews only, and not also of the Gentiles? Yes, also of the Gentiles:
if indeed He is one God,” <span id="fr_2993"></span>[2994](#fn_2993)
exclaims the noble apostle.
