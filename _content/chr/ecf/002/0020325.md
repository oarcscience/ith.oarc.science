<span id="vi.iv.ii.i"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Introductory. <span id="fr_2152"></span>[2153](#fn_2152)

<span id="vi.iv.ii.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.i-p2.1"></span>As</span> Scripture has called the Greeks
pilferers of the Barbarian <span id="fr_2153"></span>[2154](#fn_2153)
philosophy, it will next have to be considered how this may be briefly
demonstrated. For we shall not only show that they have imitated and
copied the marvels recorded in our books; but we shall prove, besides,
that they have plagiarized and falsified (our writings being, as we have
shown, older) the chief dogmas they hold, both on faith and knowledge
and science, and hope and love, and also on repentance and temperance
and the fear of God,—a whole swarm, verily, of the virtues of truth.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.i-p4"></span>Whatever the explication necessary on
the point in hand shall demand, shall be embraced, and especially what
is occult in the barbarian philosophy, the department of symbol and
enigma; which those who have subjected the teaching of the ancients to
systematic philosophic study have affected, as being in the highest
degree serviceable, nay, absolutely necessary to the knowledge of truth.
In addition, it will in my opinion form an appropriate sequel to defend
those tenets, on account of which the Greeks assail us, making use of a
few Scriptures, if perchance the Jew also may listen <span
id="fr_2154"></span>[2155](#fn_2154) and be able quietly to turn from
what he has believed to Him on whom he has not believed. The ingenuous
among the philosophers will then with propriety be taken up in a
friendly exposure both of their life and of the discovery of new dogmas,
not in the way of our avenging ourselves on our detractors (for that is
far from being the case with those who have learned to bless those who
curse, even though they needlessly discharge on us words of blasphemy),
but with a view to their conversion; if by any means these adepts in
wisdom may feel ashamed, being brought to their senses by barbarian
demonstration; so as to be able, although late, to see clearly of what
sort are the intellectual acquisitions for which they make pilgrimages
over the seas. Those they have stolen are to be pointed out, that we may
thereby pull down their conceit; and of those on the discovery of which
through investigation they plume themselves, the refutation will be
furnished. By consequence, also we must treat of what is called the
curriculum of study—how far it is serviceable; <span
id="fr_2155"></span>[2156](#fn_2155) and of astrology, and mathematics,
and magic, and sorcery. For all the Greeks boast of these as the highest
sciences. “He who reproves boldly is a peacemaker.” <span
id="fr_2156"></span>[2157](#fn_2156) We lave often said already that we
have neither practiced nor do we study the expressing ourselves in pure
Greek; for this suits those who seduce the multitude from the truth. But
true philosophic demonstration will contribute to the profit not of the
listeners’ tongues, but of their minds. And, in my opinion, he who is
solicitous about truth ought not to frame his language with artfulness
and care, but only to try to express his meaning as he best can. For
those who are particular about words, and devote their time to them,
miss the things. <span id="fr_2157"></span>[2158](#fn_2157) It is a feat
fit for the gardener to pluck without injury the rose that is growing
among the thorns; and for the craftsman to find out the pearl buried in
the oyster’s flesh. And they say that fowls have flesh of the most
agreeable quality, when, through not being supplied with abundance of
food, they pick their sustenance with difficulty, scraping with their
feet. If any one, then, speculating on what is <span id="page_348">p.
348</span> <span id="vi.iv.ii.i-Page_348"></span>similar, wants to
arrive <span id="fr_2158"></span>[2159](#fn_2158) at the truth \[that
is\] in the numerous Greek plausibilities, like the real face beneath
masks, he will hunt it out with much pains. For the power that appeared
in the vision to Hermas said, “Whatever may be revealed to you, shall be
revealed.” <span id="fr_2159"></span>[2160](#fn_2159)

<span id="vi.iv.ii.i-p1"></span> \[“The Epistles of the New Testament
have all a particular reference *to the condition and usages of the
Christian world at the time they were written.* Therefore as they cannot
be thoroughly understood, unless that condition and those usages are
known and attended to, so futher, though they be known, yet if they be
discontinued or changed … references to such circumstances, now ceased
or altered, cannot, at this time, be urged in that manner and with that
force which they were to the primitive Christians.” This quotation from
one of Bishop Butler’s *Ethical Sermons* has many bearings on the study
of our author; but the sermon itself, with its sequel, *On Human
Nature*, may well be read in connection with the *Stromata*. See Butler,
*Ethical Discourses*, p. 77. Philadelphia, 1855.\]
