##### <span id="vi.iv.i.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The Eclectic Philosophy Paves the Way for Divine Virtue.

<span id="vi.iv.i.vii-p1"></span>The Greek preparatory culture,
therefore, with philosophy itself, is shown to have come down from God
to men, not with a definite direction but in the way in which showers
fall down on the good land, and on the dunghill, and on the houses. And
similarly both the grass and the wheat sprout; and the figs and any
other reckless trees grow on sepulchres. And things that grow, appear as
a type of truths. For they enjoy the same influence of the rain. But
they have not the same grace as those which spring up in rich soil,
inasmuch as they are withered or plucked up. And here we are aided by
the parable of the sower, which the Lord interpreted. For the husbandman
of the soil which is among men is one; He who from the beginning, from
the foundation of the world, sowed nutritious seeds; He who in each age
rained down the Lord, the Word. But the times and places which received
\[such gifts\], created the differences which exist. Further, the
husbandman sows not only wheat (of which there are many varieties), but
also other seeds—barley, and beans, and peas, and vetches, and vegetable
and flower seeds. And to the same husbandry belongs both planting and
the operations necessary in the nurseries, and gardens, and orchards,
and the planning and rearing of all sorts of trees.

<span id="vi.iv.i.vii-p2"></span>In like manner, not only the care of
sheep, but the care of herds, and breeding of horses, and dogs, and
bee-craft, all arts, and to speak comprehensively, the care of flocks
and the rearing of animals, differ from each other more or less, but are
all useful for life. And philosophy—I do not mean the Stoic, or the
Platonic, or the Epicurean, or the Aristotelian, but whatever has been
well said by each of those sects, which teach righteousness along with a
science pervaded by piety,—this eclectic whole I call philosophy. <span
id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875) But such conclusions of human
reasonings, as men have cut away and falsified, I would never call
divine.

<span id="vi.iv.i.vii-p4"></span>And now we must look also at this, that
if ever those who know not how to do well, live well; <span
id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876) for they have lighted on
well-doing. Some, too, have aimed well at the word of truth through
understanding. “But Abraham was not justified by works, but by
faith.” <span id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877) It is therefore of no
advantage to them after the end of life, even if they do good works now,
if they have not faith. Wherefore also the Scriptures <span
id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878) were translated into the language
of the Greeks, in order that they might never be able to allege the
excuse of ignorance, inasmuch as they are able to hear also what we have
in our hands, if they only wish. One speaks in one way of the truth, in
another way the truth interprets itself. The guessing at truth is one
thing, and truth itself is another. Resemblance is one thing, the thing
itself is another. And the one results from learning and practice, the
other from power and faith. For the teaching of piety is a gift, but
faith is grace. “For by doing the will of God we know the will of
God.” <span id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879) “Open, then,” says the
Scripture, “the gates of righteousness; and I will enter in, and confess
to the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.i.vii-p8.2"></span>Lord</span>.” <span
id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880) But the paths to righteousness
(since God saves in many ways, for He is good) are many and various, and
lead to the Lord’s way and gate. And if you ask the royal and true
entrance, you will hear, “This is the gate of the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.i.vii-p9.2"></span>Lord</span>, the righteous shall enter in
by it.” <span id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881) While there are many
gates open, that in righteousness is in Christ, by which all the blessed
enter, and direct their steps in the sanctity of knowledge. Now Clemens,
in his Epistle to the Corinthians, while expounding the differences of
those who are approved according to the Church, says expressly, “One may
be a believer; one may be powerful in uttering knowledge; one may be
wise in discriminating between words; one may be terrible in
deeds.” <span id="fr_1882"></span>[1883](#fn_1882)
