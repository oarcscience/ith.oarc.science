##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—The Love of All, Even of Our Enemies.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xiii-p1"></span>How great also is benignity! “Love
your enemies,” it is said, “bless them who curse you, and pray for them
who despitefully use you,” <span id="fr_2808"></span>[2809](#fn_2808)
and the like; to which it is added, “that ye may be the children of your
Father who is in heaven,” in allusion to resemblance to God. Again, it
is said, “Agree with thine adversary quickly, whilst thou art in the way
with him.” <span id="fr_2809"></span>[2810](#fn_2809) The adversary is
not the body, as some would have it, but the devil, and those
assimilated to him, who walks along with us in the person of men, who
emulate his deeds in this earthly life. It is inevitable, then, that
those who confess themselves to belong to Christ, but find themselves in
the midst of the devil’s works, suffer the most hostile treatment. For
it is written, “Lest he deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver
thee to the officers of Satan’s kingdom.” “For I am persuaded that
neither death,” through the assault of persecutors, “nor life” in this
world, “nor angels,” the apostate ones, “nor powers” (and Satan’s power
is the life which he chose, for such are the powers and principalities
of darkness belonging to him), “nor things present,” amid which we exist
during the time of life, as the hope entertained by the soldier, and the
merchant’s gain, “nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature,” in
consequence of the energy proper to a man,—opposes the faith of him who
acts according to free choice. “Creature” is synonymous with activity,
being our work, and such activity “shall not be able to separate us from
the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” <span
id="fr_2810"></span>[2811](#fn_2810) You have got a compendious account
of the gnostic martyr.
