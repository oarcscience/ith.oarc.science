##### <span id="v.ii.xxxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—Chastity of the Christians with Respect to Marriage.

<span id="v.ii.xxxiii-p1"></span>Therefore, having the hope of eternal
life, we despise the things of this life, even to the pleasures of the
soul, each of us reckoning her his wife whom he has married according to
the laws laid down by us, and that only for the purpose of having
children. For as the husbandman throwing the seed into the ground awaits
the harvest, not sowing more upon it, so to us the procreation of
children is the measure of our indulgence in appetite. Nay, you would
find many among us, both men and women, growing old unmarried, in hope
of living in closer communion with God. <span
id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824) But if the remaining in virginity and
in the state of an eunuch brings nearer to God, while the indulgence of
carnal thought and desire leads away from Him, in those cases in which
we shun the thoughts, much more do we reject the deeds. For we bestow
our attention, not on the study of words, but on the exhibition and
teaching of actions,—that a person should either remain as he was born,
or be content with one marriage; for a second marriage is only a
specious adultery. <span id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825) “For
whosoever puts away his wife,” says He, “and <span id="page_147">p.
147</span> <span id="v.ii.xxxiii-Page_147"></span>marries another,
commits adultery;” <span id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826) not
permitting a man to send her away whose virginity he has brought to an
end, nor to marry again. For he who deprives himself of his first wife,
even though she be dead, is a cloaked adulterer, <span
id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827) resisting the hand of God, because in
the beginning God made one man and one woman, and dissolving the
strictest union of flesh with flesh, formed for the intercourse of the
race.
