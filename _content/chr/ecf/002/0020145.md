##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Wickedness Attributed to the Gods by Heathen Writers.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p1"></span>For, denying that there are gods,
they again acknowledge their existence, and they said they committed
grossly wicked deeds. And, first, of Jove the poets euphoniously sing
the wicked actions. And Chrysippus, who talked a deal of nonsense, is he
not found publishing that Juno had the foulest intercourse with Jupiter?
For why should I recount the impurities of the so-called mother of the
gods, or of Jupiter Latiaris thirsting for human blood, or the castrated
Attis; or of Jupiter, surnamed Tragedian, and how he defiled himself, as
they say, and now is worshipped among the Romans as a god? I am silent
about the temples of Antinous, and of the others whom you call gods. For
when related to sensible persons, they excite laughter. They who
elaborated such a philosophy regarding either the non-existence of God,
or promiscuous intercourse and beastly concubinage, are themselves
condemned by their own teachings. Moreover, we find from the writings
they composed that the eating of human flesh was received among them;
and they record that those whom they honour as gods were the first to do
these things.
