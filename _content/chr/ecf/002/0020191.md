##### <span id="v.ii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Impure Loves Ascribed to the Gods.

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p1"></span>But should it be said that they only had
fleshly forms, and possess blood and seed, and the affections of anger
and sexual desire, even then we must regard such assertions as
nonsensical and ridiculous; for there is neither anger, nor desire and
appetite, nor procreative seed, in gods. Let them, then, have fleshly
forms, but let them be superior to wrath and anger, that Athênâ may not
be seen

> <span id="v.ii.xxi-p1.1"></span> “Burning with rage and inly wroth
> with Jove;” <span id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764)  

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p3"></span>nor Hera appear thus:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxi-p3.1"></span> “Juno’s breast  
> Could not contain her rage.” <span id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765)  

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p5"></span>And let them be superior to grief:—

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span> <span id="v.ii.xxi-Page_139"></span>

> <span id="v.ii.xxi-p5.1"></span> “A woful sight mine eyes behold: a
> man  
> I love in flight around the walls! My heart  
> For Hector grieves.” <span id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766)  

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p7"></span>For I call even men rude and stupid who
give way to anger and grief. But when the “father of men and gods”
mourns for his son,—

> <span id="v.ii.xxi-p7.1"></span> “Woe, woe! that fate decrees my best
> belov’d  
> Sarpedon, by Patroclus’ hand to fall;” <span
> id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767)  

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p9"></span>and is not able while he mourns to rescue
him from his peril:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxi-p9.1"></span> “The son of Jove, yet Jove preserv’d
> him not;” <span id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768)  

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p11"></span>who would not blame the folly of those
who, with tales like these, are lovers of the gods, or rather, live
without any god? Let them have fleshly forms, but let not Aphrodité be
wounded by Diomedes in her body:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxi-p11.1"></span> “The haughty son of Tydeus,
> Diomed,  
> Hath wounded me;” <span id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769)  

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p13"></span>or by Arês in her soul:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxi-p13.1"></span> “Me, awkward me, she scorns; and
> yields her charms  
> To that fair lecher, the strong god of arms.” <span
> id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770)  
> “The weapon pierced the flesh.” <span
> id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771)  

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p16"></span>He who was terrible in battle, the ally
of Zeus against the Titans, is shown to be weaker than Diomedes:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxi-p16.1"></span> “He raged, as Mars, when brandishing
> his spear.” <span id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772)  

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p18"></span>Hush! Homer, a god never rages. But you
describe the god to me as blood-stained, and the bane of mortals:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxi-p18.1"></span> “Mars, Mars, the bane of mortals,
> stained with blood;” <span id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773)  

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p20"></span>and you tell of his adultery and his
bonds:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxi-p20.1"></span> “Then, nothing loth, th’ enamour’d
> fair he led,  
> And sunk transported on the conscious bed.  
> Down rushed the toils.” <span id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774)  

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p22"></span>Do they not pour forth impious stuff of
this sort in abundance concerning the gods? Ouranos is mutilated; Kronos
is bound, and thrust down to Tartarus; the Titans revolt; Styx dies in
battle: yea, they even represent them as mortal; they are in love with
one another; they are in love with human beings:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxi-p22.1"></span> “Æneas, amid Ida’s jutting peaks,  
> Immortal Venus to Anchises bore.” <span
> id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775)  

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p24"></span>Are they not in love? Do they not suffer?
Nay, verily, they are gods, and desire cannot touch them! Even though a
god assume flesh in pursuance of a divine purpose, <span
id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776) he is therefore the slave of desire.

> <span id="v.ii.xxi-p25.2"></span> “For never yet did such a flood of
> love,  
> For goddess or for mortal, fill my soul;  
> Not for Ixion’s beauteous wife, who bore  
> Pirithöus, sage in council as the gods;  
> Nor the neat-footed maiden Danäe,  
> A crisius’ daughter, her who Perséus bore,  
> Th’ observ’d of all; nor noble Phœnix’ child;  
> .  .  .  .  .  .  nor for Semele;  
> Nor for Alcmena fair;  .  .  .  
> No, nor for Ceres, golden-tressèd queen;  
> Nor for Latona bright; nor for thyself.” <span
> id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777)  

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p27"></span>He is created, he is perishable, with no
trace of a god in him. Nay, they are even the hired servants of men:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxi-p27.1"></span> “Admetus’ halls, in which I have
> endured  
> To praise the menial table, though a god.” <span
> id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778)  

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p29"></span>And they tend cattle:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxi-p29.1"></span> “And coming to this land, I cattle
> fed,  
> For him that was my host, and kept this house.” <span
> id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779)  

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p31"></span>Admetus, therefore, was superior to the
god. prophet and wise one, and who canst foresee for others the things
that shall be, thou didst not divine the slaughter of thy beloved, but
didst even kill him with thine own hand, dear as he was:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxi-p31.1"></span> “And I believed Apollo’s mouth
> divine  
> Was full of truth, as well as prophet’s art.”  

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p32"></span>(Æschylus is reproaching Apollo for being
a false prophet:)—

> <span id="v.ii.xxi-p32.1"></span> “The very one who sings while at the
> feast,  
> The one who said these things, alas! is he  
> Who slew my son.” <span id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780)
