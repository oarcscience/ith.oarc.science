##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—Of Humanity to Strangers.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.x-p1"></span>Since therefore they were strangers in
the land of Egypt, being by birth Hebrews from the land of Chaldæa,—for
at that time, there being a famine, they were obliged to migrate to
Egypt for the sake of buying food there, where also for a time they
sojourned; and these things befell them in accordance with a prediction
of God,—having sojourned, then, in Egypt for 430 years, when Moses was
about to lead them out into the desert, God taught them by the law,
saying, “Ye shall not afflict a stranger; for ye know the heart of a
stranger: for yourselves were strangers in the land of Egypt.” <span
