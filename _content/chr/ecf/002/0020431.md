##### <span id="vi.iv.viii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—The Object of Philosophical and Theological Inquiry—The Discovery of Truth. <span id="fr_3702"></span>[3703](#fn_3702)

<span id="vi.iv.viii.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.viii.i-p2.1"></span>But</span> the most ancient of the
philosophers were not carried away to disputing and doubting, much less
are we, who are attached to the really true philosophy, on whom the
Scripture enjoins examination and investigation. For it is the more
recent of the Hellenic philosophers who, by empty and futile love of
fame, are led into useless babbling in refuting and wrangling. But, on
the contrary, the Barbarian philosophy, expelling all contention, said,
“Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you; ask,
and it shall be given you.” <span id="fr_3703"></span>[3704](#fn_3703)

<span id="vi.iv.viii.i-p4"></span>Accordingly, by investigation, the
point proposed for inquiry and answer knocks at the door of truth,
according to what appears. And on an opening being made through the
obstacle in the process of investigation, there results scientific
contemplation. To those who thus knock, according to my view, the
subject under investigation is opened.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.i-p5"></span>And to those who thus ask questions,
in the Scriptures, there is given from God (that at which they aim) the
gift of the God-given knowledge, by way of comprehension, through the
true illumination of logical investigation. For it is impossible to
find, without having sought; or to have sought, without having examined;
or to have examined, without having unfolded and opened up the question
by interrogation, to produce distinctness; or again, to have gone
through the whole investigation, without thereafter receiving as the
prize the knowledge of the point in question.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.i-p6"></span>But it belongs to him who has sought,
to find; and to him to seek, who thinks previously that he does not
know. Hence drawn by desire to the discovery of what is good, he seeks
thoughtfully, without love of strife or glory, asking, answering, and
besides considering the statements made. For it is incumbent, in
applying ourselves not only to the divine Scriptures, but also to common
notions, to institute investigations, the discovery ceasing at some
useful end.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.i-p7"></span>For another place and crowd await
turbulent people, and forensic sophistries. But it is suitable for him,
who is at once a lover and disciple of the truth, to be pacific even in
investigations, advancing by scientific demonstration, without love of
self, but with love of truth, to comprehensive knowledge.
