<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Continuation: with Texts from Scripture.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p1"></span>I would counsel the married never to
kiss their wives in the presence of their domestics. For Aristotle does
not allow people to laugh to their slaves. And by no means must a wife
be seen saluted in their presence. It is moreover better that, beginning
at home with marriage, we should exhibit propriety in it. For it is the
greatest bond of chastity, breathing forth pure pleasure. Very admirably
the tragedy says:—

> <span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p1.1"></span> “Well! well! ladies, how is it,
> then, that among men,  
> Not gold, not empire, or luxury of wealth,  
> Conferred to such an extent signal delights,  
> As the right and virtuous disposition  
> Of a man of worth and a dutiful wife?”  

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p2"></span>Such injunctions of righteousness
uttered by those who are conversant with worldly wisdom are not to be
refused. Knowing, then, the duty of each, “pass the time of your
sojourning here in fear: forasmuch as ye know that ye were not deemed
with corruptible things, such as silver or gold, from your vain
conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the
precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without
spot.” <span id="fr_1736"></span>[1737](#fn_1736) “For,” says Peter,
“the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of
the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine,
revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries.” <span
id="fr_1737"></span>[1738](#fn_1737) We have as a limit the cross of the
Lord, by which we are fenced and hedged about from our former sins.
Therefore, being regenerated, let us fix ourselves to it in truth, and
return to sobriety, and sanctify ourselves; “for the eyes of the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p4.2"></span>Lord</span> are on the
righteous, and His ears are open to their prayer; but the face of the
<span class="sc"><span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p4.3"></span>Lord</span> is
against them that do evil.” <span id="fr_1738"></span>[1739](#fn_1738)
And who is he that will harm us, if we <span id="page_292">p. 292</span>
<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-Page_292"></span>be followers of that which is
good?” <span id="fr_1739"></span>[1740](#fn_1739) —“us” for “you.” But
the best training is good order, which is perfect decorum, and stable
and orderly power, which in action maintains consistence in what it
does. If these things have been adduced by me with too great asperity,
in order to effect the salvation which follows from your correction;
they have been spoken also, says the Instructor, by me: “Since he who
reproves with boldness is a peacemaker.” <span
id="fr_1740"></span>[1741](#fn_1740) And if ye hear me, ye shall be
saved. And if ye attend not to what is spoken, it is not my concern. And
yet it is my concern thus: “For he desires the repentance rather than
the death of a sinner.” <span id="fr_1741"></span>[1742](#fn_1741) “If
ye shall hear me, ye shall eat the good of the land,” the Instructor
again says, calling by the appellation “the good of the land,” beauty,
wealth, health, strength, sustenance. For those things which are really
good, are what “neither ear hath heard, not hath ever entered into the
heart” <span id="fr_1742"></span>[1743](#fn_1742) respecting Him who is
really King, and the realities truly good which await us. For He is the
giver and the guard of good things. And with respect to their
participation, He applies the same names of things in this world, the
Word thus training in God the feebleness of men from sensible things to
understanding.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p10"></span>What has to be observed at home,
and how our life is to be regulated, the Instructor has abundantly
declared. And the things which He is wont to say to children by the
way, <span id="fr_1743"></span>[1744](#fn_1743) while He conducts them
to the Master, these He suggests, and adduces the Scriptures themselves
in a compendious form, setting forth bare injunctions, accommodating
them to the period of guidance, and assigning the interpretation of them
to the Master. <span id="fr_1744"></span>[1745](#fn_1744) For the
intention of His law is to dissipate fear, emancipating free-will in
order to faith. “Hear,” He says, “O child,” who art rightly instructed,
the principal points of salvation. For I will disclose my ways, and lay
before thee good commandments; by which thou wilt reach salvation. And I
lead thee by the way of salvation. Depart from the paths of deceit.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p13"></span>“For the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p13.1"></span>Lord</span> knoweth the way of the
righteous, and the way of the ungodly shall perish.” <span
id="fr_1745"></span>[1746](#fn_1745) “Follow, therefore, O son, the good
way which I shall describe, lending to me attentive ears.” “And I will
give to thee the treasures of darkness, hidden and unseen” <span
id="fr_1746"></span>[1747](#fn_1746) by the nations, but seen by us. And
the treasures of wisdom are unfailing, in admiration of which the
apostle says, “O the depth of the riches and the wisdom!” <span
id="fr_1747"></span>[1748](#fn_1747) And by one God are many treasures
dispensed; some disclosed by the law, others by the prophets; some to
the divine mouth, and others to the heptad of the spirit singing
accordant. And the Lord being one, is the same Instructor by all these.
Here is then a comprehensive precept, and an exhortation of life,
all-embracing: “As ye would that men should do unto you, do ye likewise
to, them.” <span id="fr_1748"></span>[1749](#fn_1748) We may comprehend
the commandments in two, as the Lord says, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy strength;
and thy neighbour as thyself.” Then from these He infers, “on this hang
the law and the prophets.” <span id="fr_1749"></span>[1750](#fn_1749)
Further, to him that asked, “What good thing shall I do, that I may
inherit eternal life?” He answered, “Thou knowest the commandments?” And
on him replying Yea, He said, “This do, and thou shalt be saved.”
Especially conspicuous is the love of the Instructor set forth in
various salutary commandments, in order that the discovery may be
readier, from the abundance and arrangement of the Scriptures. We have
the Decalogue <span id="fr_1750"></span>[1751](#fn_1750) given by Moses,
which, indicating by an elementary principle, simple and of one kind,
defines the designation of sins in a way conducive to salvation: “Thou
shall not commit adultery. Thou shall not worship idols. Thou shalt not
corrupt boys. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shall not bear false witness.
Honour thy father and thy mother.” <span
id="fr_1751"></span>[1752](#fn_1751) And so forth. These things are to
be observed, and whatever else is commanded in reading the Bible. And He
enjoins on us by Isaiah: “Wash you, and make you clean. Put away
iniquities from your souls before mine eyes. Learn to do well. Seek
judgment. Deliver the wronged. Judge for the orphan, and justify the
widow. And come, and let us reason together, saith the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1752"></span>[1753](#fn_1752) And we shall find many examples
also in other places,—as, for instance, respecting prayer: “Good works
are an acceptable prayer to the Lord,” says the Scripture. <span
id="fr_1753"></span>[1754](#fn_1753) And the manner of prayer is
described. “If thou seest,” it is said, “the naked, cover him; and thou
shalt not overlook those who belong to thy seed. Then shall thy light
spring forth early, and thy healing shall spring up quickly; and thy
righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of God shall encompass
thee.” What, then, is the fruit of such prayer? “Then shall thou call,
and God will hear thee; whilst thou art yet speaking, He will say, I am
here.” <span id="fr_1754"></span>[1755](#fn_1754)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p24"></span>In regard to fasting it is said,
“Wherefore do <span id="page_293">p. 293</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.xii-Page_293"></span>ye fast to me? saith the Lord. Is it
such a fast that I have chosen, even a day for a man to humble his soul?
Thou shall not bend thy neck like a circle, and spread sackcloth and
ashes under thee. Not thus shall ye call it an acceptable fast.”

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p25"></span>What means a fast, then? “Lo, this
is the fast which I have chosen, saith the Lord. Loose every band of
wickedness. Dissolve the knots of oppressive contracts. Let the
oppressed go free, and tear every unjust bond. Break thy bread to the
hungry; and lead the houseless poor into thy house. If thou see the
naked cover him.” <span id="fr_1755"></span>[1756](#fn_1755) About
sacrifices too: “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to
me? saith the Lord. I am full of burnt-offerings and of rams; and the
fat of lambs, and the blood of bulls and kids I do not wish; nor that ye
should come to appear before me. Who hath required this at your hands?
You shall no more tread my court. If ye bring fine flour, the vain
oblation is an abomination to me. Your new moons and your sabbaths I
cannot away with.” <span id="fr_1756"></span>[1757](#fn_1756) How, then,
shall I sacrifice to the Lord? “The sacrifice of the Lord is,” He says,
“a broken heart.” <span id="fr_1757"></span>[1758](#fn_1757) How, then,
shall I crown myself, or anoint with ointment, or offer incense to the
Lord? “An odour of a sweet fragrance,” it is said, <span
id="fr_1758"></span>[1759](#fn_1758) “is the heart that glorifies Him
who made it.” These are the crowns and sacrifices, aromatic odours, and
flowers of God.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p30"></span>Further, in respect to forbearance.
“If thy brother,” it is said, “sin against thee, rebuke him; and if he
repent, forgive him. If he sin against thee seven times in a day, and
turn to thee the seventh time, and say, I repent, forgive him.” <span
id="fr_1759"></span>[1760](#fn_1759) Also to the soldiers, by John, He
commands, “to be content with their wages only;” and to the publicans,
“to exact no more than is appointed.” To the judges He says, “Thou shalt
not show partiality in judgment. For gifts blind the eyes of those who
see, and corrupt just words. Rescue the wronged.”

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p32"></span>And to householders: “A possession
which is acquired with iniquity becomes less.” <span
id="fr_1760"></span>[1761](#fn_1760)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p34"></span>Also of “love.” “Love,” He says,
“covers a multitude of sins.” <span id="fr_1761"></span>[1762](#fn_1761)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p36"></span>And of civil government: “Render to
Cæsar the things which are Cæsar’s; and unto God the things which are
God’s.” <span id="fr_1762"></span>[1763](#fn_1762)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p38"></span>Of swearing and the remembrance of
injuries: “Did I command your fathers, when they went out of Egypt, to
offer burnt-offerings and sacrifices? But I commanded them, Let none of
you bear malice in his heart against his neighbour, or love a false
oath.” <span id="fr_1763"></span>[1764](#fn_1763)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p40"></span>The liars and the proud, too, He
threatens; the former thus: “Woe to them that call bitter sweet, and
sweet bitter;” and the latter: “Woe unto them that are wise in their own
eyes, and prudent in their own sight.” <span
id="fr_1764"></span>[1765](#fn_1764) “For he that humbleth himself shall
be exalted, and he that exalteth himself shall be humbled.” <span
id="fr_1765"></span>[1766](#fn_1765)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p43"></span>And “the merciful” He blesses, “for
they shall obtain mercy.”

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p44"></span>Wisdom pronounces anger a wretched
thing, because “it will destroy the wise.” <span
id="fr_1766"></span>[1767](#fn_1766) And now He bids us “love our
enemies, bless them that curse us, and pray for them that despitefully
use us.” And He says: “If any one strike thee on the one cheek, turn to
him the other also; and if any one take away thy coat, hinder him not
from taking thy cloak also.” <span id="fr_1767"></span>[1768](#fn_1767)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p47"></span>Of faith He says: “Whatsoever ye
shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.” <span
id="fr_1768"></span>[1769](#fn_1768) “To the unbelieving nothing is
trustworthy,” according to Pindar.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p49"></span>Domestics, too, are to be treated
like ourselves; for they are human beings, as we are. For God is the
same to free and bond, if you consider.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p50"></span>Such of our brethren as transgress,
we must not punish, but rebuke. “For he that spareth the rod hateth his
son.” <span id="fr_1769"></span>[1770](#fn_1769)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p52"></span>Further, He banishes utterly love
of glory, saying, “Woe to you, Pharisees! for ye love the chief seat in
the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.” <span
id="fr_1770"></span>[1771](#fn_1770) But He welcomes the repentance of
the sinner—loving repentance—which follows sins. For this Word of whom
we speak alone is sinless. For to sin is natural and common to all. But
to return \[to God\] after sinning is characteristic not of any man, but
only of a man of worth.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p54"></span>Respecting liberality He said:
“Come to me, ye blessed, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world: for I was an hungry, and ye gave Me meat; I was
thirsty, and ye gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took Me in;
naked, and ye clothed Me; sick, and ye visited Me; in prison, and ye
came unto Me.” And when have we done any of these things to the Lord?

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p55"></span>The Instructor Himself will say
again, loving to refer to Himself the kindness of the brethren,
“Inasmuch as ye have done it to these least, ye have done it to Me. And
these shall go away into everlasting life.” <span
id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771)

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.xii-Page_294"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p57"></span>Such are the laws of the Word, the
consolatory words not on tables of stone which were written by the
finger of the Lord, but inscribed on men’s hearts, on which alone they
can remain imperishable. Wherefore the tablets of those who had hearts
of stone are broken, that the faith of the children may be impressed on
softened hearts.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p58"></span>However, both the laws served the
Word for the instruction of humanity, both that given by Moses and that
by the apostles. What, therefore, is the nature of the training by the
apostles, appears to me to require to be treated of. Under this head, I,
or rather the Instructor by me, <span
id="fr_1772"></span>[1773](#fn_1772) will recount; and I shall again set
before you the precepts themselves, as it were in the germ.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p60"></span>“Putting away lying, speak every
man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another. Let not
the sun go down upon your wrath; neither give place to the devil. Let
him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with
his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that
needeth. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and
evil-speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: and be ye kind one
to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ hath
forgiven you. Be therefore wise, <span
id="fr_1773"></span>[1774](#fn_1773) followers of God, as dear children;
and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us. Let wives be subject to
their own husbands, as to the Lord. And let husbands love their wives as
Christ also hath loved the Church.” Let those who are yoked together
love one another “as their own bodies.” “Children, be obedient to your
parents. Parents, provoke not your children to wrath; but bring them up
in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Servants, be obedient to
those that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and
trembling, in the singleness of your hearts, as unto Christ; with
good-will from the soul doing service. ye masters, treat your servants
well, forbearing threatening: knowing that both their and your Lord is
in heaven; and there is no respect of persons with Him.” <span
id="fr_1774"></span>[1775](#fn_1774)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p63"></span>“If we live in the Spirit, let us
walk in the Spirit. Let us not be desirous of vainglory, provoking one
another, envying one another. Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so
fulfil the law of Christ. Be not deceived; God is not mocked. Let us not
be weary in well-doing: for in due time we shall reap, if we faint
not.” <span id="fr_1775"></span>[1776](#fn_1775)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p65"></span>“Be at peace among yourselves. Now
we admonish you, brethren, warn them who are unruly, comfort the
feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. See that
none render evil for evil to any man. Quench not the Spirit. Despise not
prophesyings. Prove all things: hold fast that which is good. Abstain
from every form of evil.” <span id="fr_1776"></span>[1777](#fn_1776)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p67"></span>“Continue in prayer, watching
thereunto with thanksgiving. Walk in wisdom towards them that are
without, redeeming the time. Let your speech be always with grace,
seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every
man.” <span id="fr_1777"></span>[1778](#fn_1777)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p69"></span>“Nourish yourselves up in the words
of faith. Exercise yourselves unto godliness: for bodily exercise
profiteth little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having the
promise of the life which now is, and that which is to come.” <span
id="fr_1778"></span>[1779](#fn_1778)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p71"></span>“Let those who have faithful
masters not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them
service, because they are faithful.” <span
id="fr_1779"></span>[1780](#fn_1779)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p73"></span>“He that giveth, let him do it with
simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with
cheerfulness. Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is
evil; cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one to another
with brotherly love, in honour preferring one another. Not slothful in
business; fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. Rejoicing in hope;
patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer. Given to
hospitality; communicating to the necessities of the saints.” <span
id="fr_1780"></span>[1781](#fn_1780)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p75"></span>Such are a few injunctions out of
many, for the sake of example, which the Instructor, running over the
divine Scriptures, sets before His children; by which, so to speak, vice
is cut up by the roots, and iniquity is circumscribed.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p76"></span>Innumerable commands such as these
are written in the holy Bible appertaining to chosen persons, some to
presbyters, some to bishops, some to deacons, others to widows, <span
id="fr_1781"></span>[1782](#fn_1781) of whom we shall have another
opportunity of speaking. Many things spoken in enigmas, many in
parables, may benefit such as fall in with them. But it is not my
province, says the Instructor, to teach these any longer. But we need a
Teacher of the exposition of those sacred words, to whom we must direct
our steps.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p78"></span>And now, in truth, it is time for
me to cease from my instruction, and for you to listen to the
Teacher. <span id="fr_1782"></span>[1783](#fn_1782) And He, receiving
you who have been trained up in excellent discipline, will teach you the
oracles. To noble purpose has <span id="page_295">p. 295</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.xii-Page_295"></span>the Church sung, and the Bridegroom
also, the only Teacher, the good Counsel, of the good Father, the true
Wisdom, the Sanctuary of knowledge. “And He is the propitiation for our
sins,” as John says; Jesus, who heals both our body and soul—which are
the proper man. “And not for our sins only, but also for the whole
world. And by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His
commandments. He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His
commandments, is a liar; and the truth is not in Him. But whoso keepeth
His word, in him verily is the love of God perfected. Hereby know we
that we are in Him. He that saith he abideth in Him, ought himself to
walk even as He also walked.” <span id="fr_1783"></span>[1784](#fn_1783)
O nurslings of His blessed training! let us complete the fair face of
the church; and let us run as children to our good mother. And if we
become listeners to the Word, let us glorify the blessed dispensation by
which man is trained and sanctified as a child of God, and has his
conversation in heaven, being trained from earth, and there receives the
Father, whom he learns to know on earth. The Word both does and teaches
all things, and trains in all things.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p81"></span>A horse is guided by a bit, and a
bull is guided by a yoke, and a wild beast is caught in a noose. But man
is transformed by the Word, by whom wild beasts are tamed, and fishes
caught, and birds drawn down. He it is, in truth, who fashions the bit
for the horse, the yoke for the bull, the noose for the wild beast, the
rod for the fish, the snare for the bird. He both manages the state and
tills the ground; commands, and helps, and creates the universe.

> <span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p81.1"></span> “There were figured earth, and
> sky, and sea,  
> The ever-circling sun, and full-orbed moon,  
> And all the signs that crown the vault of heaven.” <span
> id="fr_1784"></span>[1785](#fn_1784)  

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p83"></span>O divine works! O divine commands!
“Let this water undulate within itself; let this fire restrain its
wrath; let this air wander into ether; and this earth be consolidated,
and acquire motion! When I want to form man, I want matter, and have
matter in the elements. I dwell with what I have formed. If you know me,
the fire will be your slave.”

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p84"></span>Such is the Word, such is the
Instructor, the Creator of the world and of man: and of Himself, now the
world’s Instructor, by whose command we and the universe subsist, and
await judgment. “For it is not he who brings a stealthy vocal word to
men,” as Bacchylidis says, “who shall be the Word of Wisdom;” but “the
blameless, the pure, and faultless sons of God,” according to Paul, “in
the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, to shine as lights in
the world.” <span id="fr_1785"></span>[1786](#fn_1785)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p86"></span>All that remains therefore now, in
such a celebration of the Word as this, is that we address to the Word
our prayer.

##### <span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p86.1"></span>Prayer to the Pædagogus.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p87"></span>Be gracious, O Instructor, to us
Thy children, Father, Charioteer of Israel, Son and Father, both in One,
O Lord. Grant to us who obey Thy precepts, that we may perfect the
likeness of the image, and with all our power know Him who is the good
God and not a harsh judge. And do Thou Thyself cause that all of us who
have our conversation in Thy peace, who have been translated into Thy
commonwealth, having sailed tranquilly over the billows of sin, may be
wafted in calm by Thy Holy Spirit, by the ineffable wisdom, by night and
day to the perfect day; and giving thanks may praise, and praising thank
the Alone Father and Son, Son and Father, the Son, Instructor and
Teacher, with the Holy Spirit, all in One, in whom is all, for whom all
is One, for whom is eternity, whose members we all are, whose glory the
æons <span id="fr_1786"></span>[1787](#fn_1786) are; for the All-good,
All-lovely, All-wise, All-just One. To whom be glory both now and for
ever. Amen.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p89"></span>And since the Instructor, by
translating us into His Church, has united us to Himself, the teaching
and all-surveying Word, it were right that, having got to this point, we
should offer to the Lord the reward of due thanksgiving—praise suitable
to His fair instruction.

#### <span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p89.1"></span>A Hymn to Christ the Saviour.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p90"></span>Composed by St. Clement. <span

*Defence of the Nicene Creed.* \[I wish a more definite reference had
been furnished by the learned translator. Even Kaye’s reference is not
precise. Consulting Grabe’s annotations in vain, I was then obliged to
go through the foot-notes, where, at last (vol. v. part i. p. 246.), I
found in comparative obscurity Grabe’s language. It may be rendered:
“These words I think should be thus construed—*cujus gloria sunt
sœcula*—whose glory are the *heavenly spirits* or angels. Concerning
which signification of <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p91"></span> \[Elucidation III.\] The
translator has done what he could to render this hymn literally. He has
been obliged, however, to add somewhat to it in the way of expansion,
for otherwise it would have been impossible to secure anything
approaching the flow of English versification. The original is in many
parts a mere string of epithets, which no ingenuity could render in
rhymed verse without some additions.

the author of the first Christian hymn, *The Magnificat*. It is a sequel
to the psalms of her father David, and interprets them. To Clement of
Alexandria belongs the praise of leading the choir of uninspired
Christian poets, whom he thus might seem to invoke to carry on the
strain through all time.\]

*Seasons* might seem to have been suggested by this ancient example of
praise to the Maker. But, to *feel* this hymn, we must reflect upon its
superiority, in a moral point of view, to all the Attic Muse had ever
produced before.\]
