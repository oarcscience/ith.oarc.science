#### <span id="ii.iii.iii-p0.1"></span>Commandment Third.

##### <span id="ii.iii.iii-p0.2"></span>On Avoiding Falsehood, and on the Repentance of Hermas for His Dissimulation.

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p1"></span>Again he said to me, “Love the truth,
and let nothing but truth proceed from your mouth, <span
id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158) that the spirit which God has placed
in your flesh may be found truthful before all men; and the Lord, who
dwelleth in you, <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159) will be
glorified, because the Lord is truthful in every word, and in Him is no
falsehood. They therefore who lie deny the Lord, and rob Him, not giving
back to Him the deposit which they have received. For they received from
Him a spirit free from falsehood. <span
id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160) If they give him back this spirit
untruthful, they pollute the commandment of the Lord, and become
robbers.” On hearing these words, I wept most violently. When he saw me
weeping, he said to me, “Why do you weep?” And I said, “Because, sir, I
know not if I can be saved.” “Why?” said he. And I said, “Because, sir,
I never spake a true word in my life, but have ever spoken cunningly to
all, <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161) and have affirmed a lie for
the truth to all; and no one ever contradicted me, but credit was given
to my word. How then can I live, since I have acted thus?” And he said
to me, “Your feelings are indeed right and sound, for you ought as a
servant of God to have walked in truth, and not to have joined an evil
conscience with the spirit of truth, nor to have caused sadness to the
holy and true Spirit.” <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162) And I
said to him, “Never, sir, did I listen to these words with so much
attention.” And he said to me, “Now you hear them, and keep them, that
even the falsehoods which you formerly told in your transactions may
come to be believed through the truthfulness of your present statements.
For even they can become worthy of credit. If you keep these precepts,
and from this time forward you speak nothing but the truth, <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163) it will be possible for you to obtain
life. And whosoever shall hear this commandment, and depart from that
great wickedness falsehood, shall live to God.”
