##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Christian Doctrine of God and His Law.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p1"></span>Now we also confess that God exists,
but that He is one, the creator, and maker, and fashioner of this
universe; and we know that all things are arranged by His providence,
but by Him alone. And we have learned a holy law; but we have as
lawgiver Him who is really God, who teaches us to act righteously, and
to be pious, and to do <span id="page_114">p. 114</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii.ix-Page_114"></span>good. And concerning piety <span
id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646) He says, “Thou shalt have no other
gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any
likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow
down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I am the <span
class="sc"><span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p2.1"></span>Lord</span> thy
God.” <span id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647) And of doing good He said:
“Honour thy father and thy mother; that it may be well with thee, and
that thy days may be long in the land which I the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p3.2"></span>Lord</span> God give thee.” Again,
concerning righteousness: “Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt
not kill. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness
against thy neighbour. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, thou
shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, nor his land, nor his
man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his beast of burden,
nor any of his cattle, nor anything that is thy neighbour’s. Thou shalt
not wrest the judgment of the poor in his cause. <span
id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648) From every unjust matter keep thee
far. The innocent and righteous thou shalt not slay; thou shalt not
justify the wicked; and thou shalt not take a gift, for gifts blind the
eyes of them that see and pervert righteous words.” Of this divine law,
then, Moses, who also was God’s servant, was made the minister both to
all the world, and chiefly to the Hebrews, who were also called Jews,
whom an Egyptian king had in ancient days enslaved, and who were the
righteous seed of godly and holy men—Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. God,
being mindful of them, and doing marvellous and strange miracles by the
hand of Moses, delivered them, and led them out of Egypt, leading them
through what is called the desert; whom He also settled again in the
land of Canaan, which afterwards was called judæa, and gave them a law,
and taught them these things. Of this great and wonderful law, which
tends to all righteousness, the ten heads are such as we have already
rehearsed.
