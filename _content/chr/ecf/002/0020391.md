##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Plan. <span id="fr_3192"></span>[3193](#fn_3192)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.i-p2.1"></span>The</span> sixth and also the seventh
Miscellany of gnostic notes, in accordance with the true philosophy,
having delineated as well as possible the ethical argument conveyed in
them, and having exhibited what the Gnostic is in his life, proceed to
show the philosophers that he is by no means impious, as they suppose,
but that he alone is truly pious, by a compendious exhibition of the
Gnostic’s form of religion, as far as it is possible, without danger, to
commit it to writing in a book of reference. For the Lord enjoined “to
labour for the meat which endureth to eternity.” <span
id="fr_3193"></span>[3194](#fn_3193) And the prophet says, “Blessed is
he that soweth into all waters, whose ox and ass tread,” <span
id="fr_3194"></span>[3195](#fn_3194) \[that is,\] the people, from the
Law and from the Gentiles, gathered into one faith.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.i-p5"></span>“Now the weak eateth herbs,” according
to the noble apostle. <span id="fr_3195"></span>[3196](#fn_3195) *The
Instructor*, divided by us into three books, has already exhibited the
training and nurture up from the state of childhood, that is, the course
of life which from elementary instruction grows by faith; and in the
case of those enrolled in the number of men, prepares beforehand the
soul, endued with virtue, for the reception of gnostic knowledge. The
Greeks, then, clearly learning, from what shall be said by us in these
pages, that in profanely persecuting the God-loving man, they themselves
act impiously; then, as the notes advance, in accordance with the style
of the *Miscellanies*, we must solve the difficulties raised both by
Greeks and Barbarians with respect to the coming of the Lord.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.i-p7"></span>In a meadow the flowers blooming
variously, and in a park the plantations of fruit trees, are not
separated according to their species from those of other kinds. If some,
culling varieties, have composed learned collections, Meadows, and
Helicons, and Honeycombs, and Robes; then, with the things which come to
recollection by haphazard, and are expurgated neither in order nor
expression, but purposely scattered, the form of the *Miscellanies* is
promiscuously variegated like a meadow. And such being the case, my
notes shall serve as kindling sparks; and in the case of him, who is fit
for knowledge, if he chance to fall in with them, research made with
exertion will turn out to his benefit and advantage. For it is right
that labour should precede not only food but also, much more knowledge,
in the case of those that are advancing to the eternal and blessed
salvation by the “strait and narrow way,” which is truly the Lord’s.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.i-p8"></span>Our knowledge, and our spiritual garden,
is the Saviour Himself; into whom we are planted, being transferred and
transplanted, from our old life, into the good land. And transplanting
contributes to fruitfulness. The Lord, then, into whom we have been
transplanted, is the Light and the true Knowledge.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.i-p9"></span>Now knowledge is otherwise spoken of in
a twofold sense: that, commonly so called, which appears in all men
(similarly also comprehension and apprehension), universally, in the
knowledge of individual objects; in which not only the rational powers,
but equally the irrational, share, which I would never term knowledge,
inasmuch as the apprehension of things through the senses comes
naturally. But that which *par excellence* is termed knowledge, bears
the impress of judgment and reason, in the exercise of which there will
be rational cognitions alone, applying purely to objects of thought, and
resulting from the bare energy of the soul. “He is a good man,” says
David, <span id="fr_3196"></span>[3197](#fn_3196) “who pities” (those
ruined through error), “and lends” (from the communication of the word
of truth) not at haphazard, for “he will dispense his words in
judgment:” with profound calculation, “he hath dispersed, he hath given
to the poor.”
