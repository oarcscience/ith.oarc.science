##### <span id="vi.iv.v.ii-p0.1"></span>Chap. II.—On Hope.

<span id="vi.iv.v.ii-p1"></span>Respecting faith we have adduced
sufficient testimonies of writings among the Greeks. But in order not to
exceed bounds, through eagerness to collect a very great many also
respecting hope and love, suffice it merely to say that in the *Crito*
Socrates, who prefers a good life and death to life itself, thinks that
we have hope of another life after death.

<span id="vi.iv.v.ii-p2"></span>Also in the *Phœdrus* he says, “That
only when in a separate state can the soul become partaker of the wisdom
which is true, and surpasses human power; and when, having reached the
end of hope by philosophic love, desire shall waft it to heaven, then,”
says he, “does it receive the commencement of another, an immortal
life.” And in the *Symposium* he says, “That there is instilled into all
the natural love of generating what is like, and in men of generating
men alone, and in the good man of the generation of the counterpart of
himself. But it is impossible for the good man to do this without
possessing the perfect virtues, in which he will train the youth who
have recourse to him.” And as he says in the *Theœtetus,*“He will beget
and finish men. For some procreate by the body, others by the soul;”
since also with the barbarian philosophers to teach and enlighten is
called to regenerate; and “I have begotten you in Jesus Christ,” <span
id="fr_2974"></span>[2975](#fn_2974) says the good apostle somewhere.

<span id="vi.iv.v.ii-p4"></span>Empedocles, too, enumerates friendship
among the elements, conceiving it as a combining love:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.ii-p4.1"></span> “Which do you look at with your
> mind; and don’t sit gaping with your eyes.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.ii-p5"></span>Parmenides, too, in his poem, alluding
to hope, speaks thus:—

<span id="page_448">p. 448</span> <span id="vi.iv.v.ii-Page_448"></span>

> <span id="vi.iv.v.ii-p5.1"></span> “Yet look with the mind certainly
> on what is absent as present,  
> For it will not sever that which is from the grasp it has of that
> which is  
> Not, even if scattered in every direction over the world or
> combined.”
