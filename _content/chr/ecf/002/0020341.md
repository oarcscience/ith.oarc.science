##### <span id="vi.iv.ii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—On the Various Kinds of Knowledge.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xvii-p1"></span>As, then, Knowledge (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.ii.xvii-p1.1"></span>ἐπιστήμη</span>) is
an intellectual state, from which results the act of knowing, and
becomes apprehension irrefragable by reason; so also ignorance is a
receding impression, which can be dislodged by reason. And that which is
overthrown as well as that which is elaborated by reason, is in our
power. Akin to Knowledge is *experience*, cognition (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.ii.xvii-p1.2"></span>εἴδησις</span>),
Comprehension (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.xvii-p1.3"></span>σύνεσις</span>), perception, and Science.
Cognition (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.xvii-p1.4"></span>εἴδησις</span>) is the knowledge of
universals by species; and Experience is comprehensive knowledge, which
investigates the nature of each thing. Perception (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.ii.xvii-p1.5"></span>νόησις</span>) is the
knowledge of intellectual objects; and Comprehension (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.ii.xvii-p1.6"></span>σύνεσις</span>) is
the knowledge of what is compared, or a comparison that cannot be
annulled, or the faculty of comparing the objects with which Judgment
and Knowledge are occupied, both of one and each and all that goes to
make up one reason. And Science (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.xvii-p1.7"></span>γνῶσις</span>) is the knowledge of the
thing in itself, or the knowledge which harmonizes with what takes
place. Truth is the knowledge of the true; and the mental habit of truth
is the knowledge of the things which are true. Now knowledge is
constituted by the reason, and cannot be overthrown by another
reason. <span id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329) What we do not, we do
not either from not being able, or not being willing—or both.
Accordingly we don’t fly, since we neither can nor wish; we do not swim
at present, for example, since we can indeed, but do not choose; and we
are not as the Lord, since we wish, but cannot be: “for no disciple is
above his master, and it is sufficient if we be as the master:” <span
id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330) not in essence (for it is
impossible for that, which is by adoption, to be equal in substance to
that, which is by nature); but \[we are as Him\] only in our <span
id="fr_2331"></span>[2332](#fn_2331) having been made immortal, and our
being conversant with the contemplation of realities, and beholding the
Father through what belongs to Him.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xvii-p5"></span>Therefore volition takes the
precedence of all; for the intellectual powers are ministers of the
Will. “Will,” it is said, “and thou shalt be able.” <span
id="fr_2332"></span>[2333](#fn_2332) And in the Gnostic, Will, Judgment,
and Exertion are identical. For if the determinations are the same, the
opinions and judgments will be the same too; so that both his words, and
life, and conduct, are conformable to rule. “And a right heart seeketh
knowledge, <span id="page_365">p. 365</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ii.xvii-Page_365"></span>and heareth it.” “God taught me
wisdom, and I knew the knowledge of the holy.” <span
id="fr_2333"></span>[2334](#fn_2333)

for the imperative.
