##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—On Avoiding Offence.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xiv-p1"></span>“We know that we all have
knowledge”—common knowledge in common things, and the knowledge that
there is one God. For he was writing to believers; whence he adds, “But
knowledge (*gnosis*) is not in all,” being communicated to few. And
there are those who say that the knowledge about things sacrificed to
idols is not promulgated among all, “lest our liberty prove a
stumbling-block to the weak. For by <span id="page_427">p. 427</span>
<span id="vi.iv.iv.xiv-Page_427"></span>thy knowledge he that is weak is
destroyed.” <span id="fr_2811"></span>[2812](#fn_2811) Should they say,
“Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, ought that to be bought?” adding,
by way of interrogation, “asking no questions,” <span
id="fr_2812"></span>[2813](#fn_2812) as if equivalent to “asking
questions,” they give a ridiculous interpretation. For the apostle says,
“All other things buy out of the shambles, asking no questions,” with
the exception of the things mentioned in the Catholic epistle of all the
apostles, <span id="fr_2813"></span>[2814](#fn_2813) “with the consent
of the Holy Ghost,” which is written in the Acts of the Apostles, and
conveyed to the faithful by the hands of Paul himself. For they
intimated “that they must of necessity abstain from things offered to
idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication,
from which keeping themselves, they should do well.” It is a different
matter, then, which is expressed by the apostle: “Have we not power to
eat and to drink? Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as
the rest of the apostles, as the brethren of the Lord and Cephas? But we
have not used this power,” he says, “but bear all things, lest we should
occasion hindrance to the Gospel of Christ;” namely, by bearing about
burdens, when it was necessary to be untrammelled for all things; or to
become an example to those who wish to exercise temperance, not
encouraging each other to eat greedily of what is set before us, and not
to consort inconsiderately with woman. And especially is it incumbent on
those entrusted with such a dispensation to exhibit to disciples a pure
example. “For though I be free from all men, I have made myself servant
to all,” it is said, “that I might gain all. And every one that striveth
for mastery is temperate in all things.” <span
id="fr_2814"></span>[2815](#fn_2814) “But the earth is the Lord’s, and
the fulness thereof.” <span id="fr_2815"></span>[2816](#fn_2815) For
conscience’ sake, then, we are to abstain from what we ought to abstain.
“Conscience, I say, not his own,” for it is endued with knowledge, “but
that of the other,” lest he be trained badly, and by imitating in
ignorance what he knows not, he become a despiser instead of a
strong-minded man. “For why is my liberty judged of by another
conscience? For if I by grace am a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for
that for which I give thanks? Whatever ye do, do all to the glory of
God” <span id="fr_2816"></span>[2817](#fn_2816) —what you are commanded
to do by the rule of faith.
