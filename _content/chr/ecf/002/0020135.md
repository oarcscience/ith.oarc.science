##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.—The Testimonies of the Poets.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p1"></span>And that evil-doers must
necessarily be punished in proportion to their deeds, has already been,
as it were, oracularly uttered by some of the poets, as a witness both
against themselves and against the wicked, declaring that they shall be
punished. Æschylus said:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span> “He who has done must also
> suffer.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p2"></span>And Pindar himself said:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p2.1"></span> “It is fit that suffering
> follow doing.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p3"></span>So, too, Euripides:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p3.1"></span> “The deed rejoiced
> you—suffering endure;  
> The taken enemy must needs be pain’d.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p4"></span>And again:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p4.1"></span> “The foe’s pain is the hero’s
> meed.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p5"></span>And, similarly, Archilochus:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p5.1"></span> “One thing I know, I hold it
> ever true,  
> The evil-doer evil shall endure.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p6"></span>And that God sees all, and that
nothing escapes His notice, but that, being long-suffering, He refrains
until the time when He is to judge—concerning this, too, Dionysius
said:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p6.1"></span> “The eye of Justice seeing
> all,  
> Yet seemeth not to see.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p7"></span>And that God’s judgment is to be,
and that evils will suddenly overtake the wicked,—this, too, Æschylus
declared, saying:—

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-Page_110"></span>

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p7.1"></span> “Swift-footed is the approach
> of fate,  
> And none can justice violate,  
> But feels its stern hand soon or late.  
> “’Tis with you, though unheard, unseen;  
> You draw night’s curtain in between,  
> But even sleep affords no screen.  
> “’Tis with you if you sleep or wake;  
> And if abroad your way you take,  
> Its still, stern watch you cannot break.  
> “’Twill follow you, or cross your path;  
> And even night no virtue hath  
> To hide you from th’ Avenger’s wrath.  
> “To show the ill the darkness flees;  
> Then, if sin offers joy or ease,  
> Oh stop, and think that some one sees!”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p8"></span>And may we not cite Simonides
also?—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p8.1"></span> “To men no evil comes
> unheralded;  
> But God with sudden hand transforms all things.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p9"></span>Euripides again:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p9.1"></span> “The wicked and proud man’s
> prosperity  
> Is based on sand: his race abideth not;  
> And time proclaims the wickedness of men.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p10"></span>Once more Euripides:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p10.1"></span> “Not without judgment is the
> Deity,  
> But sees when oaths are struck unrighteously,  
> And when from men unwilling they are wrung.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p11"></span>And Sophocles:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p11.1"></span> “If ills you do, ills also
> you must bear.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvii-p12"></span>That God will make inquiry both
concerning false swearing and concerning every other wickedness, they
themselves have well-nigh predicted. And concerning the conflagration of
the world, they have, willingly or unwillingly, spoken in conformity
with the prophets, though they were much more recent, and stole these
things from the law and the prophets. The poets corroborate the
testimony of the prophets.
