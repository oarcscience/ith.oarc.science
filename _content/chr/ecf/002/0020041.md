##### <span id="iii.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—The Doctrine of the Christians as to the Creation of the World.

<span id="iii.ii.v-p1"></span>God was in the beginning; but the
beginning, we have been taught, is the power of the Logos. For the Lord
of the universe, who is Himself the necessary ground (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.ii.v-p1.1"></span>ὑπόστασις</span>) of all
being, inasmuch as no creature was yet in existence, was alone; but
inasmuch as He was all power, Himself the necessary ground of things
visible and invisible, with Him were all things; with Him, by
Logos-power (<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.ii.v-p1.2"></span>διὰ
λογικῆς δυνάμεως</span>), the Logos Himself also, who was in Him,
subsists. <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432) And by His simple will
the Logos springs forth; and the Logos, not coming forth in vain,
becomes the first-begotten work of the Father. Him (the Logos) we know
to be the beginning of the world. But He came into being by
participation, <span id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433) not by
abscission; for what is cut off is separated from the original
substance, but that which comes by participation, making its choice of
function, <span id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434) does not render him
deficient from whom it is taken. For just as from one torch many fires
are lighted, but the light of the first torch is not lessened by the
kindling of many torches, so the Logos, coming forth from the
Logos-power of the Father, has not divested of the Logos-power Him who
begat Him. I myself, for instance, talk, and you hear; yet, certainly, I
who converse do not become destitute of speech (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.ii.v-p4.4"></span>λόγος</span>) by the
transmission of speech, but by the utterance of my voice I endeavour to
reduce to order the unarranged matter in your minds. And as the
Logos, <span id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435) begotten in the
beginning, begat in turn our world, having first created for Himself the
necessary matter, so also I, in imitation of the Logos, being begotten
again, <span id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436) and having become
possessed of the truth, am trying to reduce to order the confused matter
which is kindred with myself. For matter is not, like God, without
beginning, nor, as having no beginning, is of equal power with God; it
is begotten, and not produced by any other being, but brought into
existence by the Framer of all things alone.

<span id="iii.ii.v-p3"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ii.v-p3.1"></span>κατὰ μερισμόν</span>. Some translate, “by
division,” but the above is preferable. The sense, according to Otto, is
that the Logos, having received a peculiar nature, shares in the
*rational power* of the Father as a lighted torch partakes of the light
of the torch from which it is kindled. Comp. Just. Mar., *Dial. c. T.*,

above seems the simplest rendering of this difficult passage, but
several others have been proposed. \[See note 4, cap. ix., *infra*, p.

beginning the history of our planet and the visible universe.\]

his conversion and baptism. As to “*confused* matter,” it should be
*kindred* matter, and must be set over “*kindred spirit.*” See p. 71,
