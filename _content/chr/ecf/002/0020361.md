##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The Objection, Why Do You Suffer If God Cares for You, Answered.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.x-p1"></span>But, say they, if God cares for you, why
are you persecuted and put to death? Has He delivered you to this? No,
we do not suppose that the Lord wishes us to be involved in calamities,
but that He foretold prophetically what would happen—that we should be
persecuted for His name’s sake, slaughtered, and impaled. So that it was
not that He wished us to be persecuted, but He intimated beforehand what
we shall suffer by the prediction of what would take place, training us
to endurance, to which He promised the inheritance, although we are
punished not alone, but along with many. But those, it is said, being
malefactors, are righteously punished. Accordingly, they unwillingly
bear testimony to our righteousness, we being unjustly punished for
righteousness’ sake. But the injustice of the judge does not affect the
providence of God. For the judge must be master of his own opinion—not
pulled by strings, like inanimate machines, set in motion only by
external causes. Accordingly he is judged in respect to his judgment, as
we also, in accordance with our choice of things desirable, and our
endurance. Although we do not wrong, yet the judge looks on us as doing
wrong, for he neither knows nor wishes to know about us, but is
influenced by unwarranted prejudice; wherefore also he is judged. <span
id="fr_2793"></span>[2794](#fn_2793) Accordingly they persecute us, not
from the supposition that we are wrong-doers, but imagining that by the
very fact of our being Christians we sin against life in so conducting
ourselves, and exhorting others to adopt the like life.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.x-p3"></span>But why are you not helped when
persecuted? say they. What wrong is done us, as far as we are concerned,
in being released by death to go to the Lord, and so undergoing a change
of life, as if a change from one time of life to another? Did we think
rightly, we should feel obliged to those who have afforded the means for
speedy departure, if it is for love that we bear witness; and if not, we
should appear to the multitude to be base men. Had they also known the
truth, all would have bounded on to the way, and there would have been
no choice. But our faith, being the light of the world, reproves
unbelief. “Should Anytus and Melitus kill me, they will not hurt me in
the least; for I do not think it right for the better to be hurt by the
worse,” \[says Socrates\]. So that each one of us may with confidence
say, “The Lord is my helper; I will not fear: what shall man do to
me?” <span id="fr_2794"></span>[2795](#fn_2794) “For the souls of the
righteous are in the hand of the Lord, and no plague shall touch
them.” <span id="fr_2795"></span>[2796](#fn_2795)

\[This is pronounced canonical Scripture by the Trent theology, and yet
the same theology asserts a purgatory to which none but the faithful are
committed.\]
