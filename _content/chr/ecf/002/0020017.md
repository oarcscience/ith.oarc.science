#### <span id="ii.iii.viii-p0.1"></span>Commandment Eighth.

##### <span id="ii.iii.viii-p0.2"></span>We Ought to Shun that Which is Evil, and Do that Which is Good.

<span id="ii.iii.viii-p1"></span>“I told you,” said he, “that the
creatures of God are double, <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200) for
restraint also is double; for in some cases restraint has to be
exercised, in others there is no need of restraint.” “Make known to me,
sir,” say I, “in what cases restraint has to be exercised, and in what
cases it has not.” “Restrain yourself in regard to evil, and do it not;
but exercise no restraint in regard to good, but do it. For if you
exercise restraint in the doing of good, you will commit a great
sin; <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201) but if you exercise
restraint, so as not to do that which is evil, you are practising great
righteousness. Restrain yourself, therefore, from all iniquity, and do
that which is good.” “What, sir,” say I, “are the evil deeds from which
we must restrain ourselves?” “Hear,” says he: “from adultery and
fornication, from unlawful revelling, <span
id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202) from wicked luxury, from indulgence in
many kinds of food and the extravagance of riches, and from
boastfulness, and haughtiness, and insolence, and lies, and backbiting,
and hypocrisy, from the remembrance of wrong, and from all slander.
These are the deeds that are most wicked in the life of men. From all
these deeds, therefore, the servant of God must restrain himself. For he
who does not restrain himself from these, cannot live to God. Listen,
then, to the deeds that accompany these.” “Are there, sir,” said I, “any
other evil deeds?” “There are,” says he; “and many of them, too, from
which the servant of God must restrain himself—theft, lying, robbery,
false witness, overreaching, wicked lust, deceit, vainglory,
boastfulness, and all other vices like to these.” “Do you not think that
these are really wicked?” “Exceedingly wicked in the servants of God.
From all of these the servant of God must restrain himself. Restrain
yourself, then, from all these, that you may live to God, and you will
be enrolled amongst those who restrain themselves in regard to these
matters. These, then, are the things from which you must restrain
yourself.”

<span id="ii.iii.viii-p5"></span>“But listen,” says he, “to the things
in regard to which you have not to exercise self-restraint, but which
you ought to do. Restrain not yourself in regard to that which is good,
but do it.” “And tell me, sir,” say I, “the nature of the good deeds,
that I may walk in them and wait on them, so that doing them I can be
saved.” “Listen,” says he, “to the good deeds which you ought to do, and
in regard to which there is no self-restraint requisite. First of
all <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203) there is faith, then fear of
the Lord, love, concord, words of righteousness, truth, patience. Than
these, nothing is better in the life of men. If any one attend to these,
and restrain himself not from them, blessed is he in his life. Then
there are the following attendant on these: helping widows, looking
after orphans and the needy, rescuing the servants of God from
necessities, the being hospitable—for in hospitality good-doing finds a
field—never opposing any one, the being quiet, having fewer needs than
all men, reverencing the aged, practising righteousness, watching the
brotherhood, bearing insolence, being long-suffering, encouraging those
who are sick in soul, not casting those who have fallen into sin from
the faith, but turning them back and restoring them to peace of mind,
admonishing sinners, not oppressing debtors and the needy, and if there
are any other actions like these. <span
id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204) Do these seem to you good?” says he.
“For what, sir,” say I, “is better than these?” “Walk then in them,”
says he, “and restrain not yourself from them, and you will live to
God. <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205) Keep, therefore, this
commandment. If you do good, and restrain not yourself from it, you will
live to God. All who act thus will live to God. And, again, if you
refuse to do evil, and restrain yourself from it, you will live to God.
And all will live to God who keep these commandments, and walk in them.”
