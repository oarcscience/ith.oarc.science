<p> <a name="v.ii.xx"></A> <h5 align="center"><a name="v.ii.xx-p0.1"></A>Chapter XX.&#8212;Absurd Representations of the Gods.</h5>  
<p><a name="v.ii.xx-p1"></A>If the absurdity of their theology were confined to saying that the gods were created, and owed their constitution to water, since I have demonstrated that nothing is made which is not also liable to dissolution, I might proceed to the remaining charges. But, on the one hand, they have described their bodily forms: speaking of Hercules, for instance, as a god in the shape of a dragon coiled up; of others as hundred-handed; of the daughter of Zeus, whom he begat of his mother Rhea; or of Demeter, as having two eyes in the natural order, and two in her forehead, and the face of an animal on the back part of her neck, and as having also horns, so that Rhea, frightened at her monster of a child, fled from her, and did not give her the breast (<span class="Greek"><a name="v.ii.xx-p1.1"></A>&#952;&#951;&#955;&#8053;</span>), whence mystically she is called Ath&ecirc;l&acirc;, but commonly Phersephon&eacute; and Kor&eacute;, though she is not the same as Ath&ecirc;n&acirc;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_761"></A><A HREF="#fn_761"><FONT SIZE="1">762</FONT></A>
 who is called Kor&eacute; from the pupil of the eye;&#8212;and, on the other hand, they have described their admirable&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_762"></A><A HREF="#fn_762"><FONT SIZE="1">763</FONT></A>
 achievements, as they deem them: how Kronos, for instance, mutilated his father, and hurled him down from his chariot, and how he murdered his children, and swallowed the males of them; and how Zeus bound his father, and cast him down to Tartarus, as did Ouranos also to his sons, and fought with the Titans for the government; and how he persecuted his mother Rhea when she refused to wed him, and, she becoming a she-dragon, and he himself being changed into a dragon, bound her with what is called the Herculean knot, and accomplished his purpose, of which fact the rod of Hermes is a symbol; and again, how he violated his daughter Phersephon&eacute;, in this case also assuming the form of a dragon, and became the father of Dionysus. In face of narrations like these, I must say at least this much, What that is becoming or useful is there in such a history, that we must believe Kronos, Zeus, Kor&eacute;, and the rest, to be gods? Is it the descriptions of their bodies? Why, what man of judgment and reflection will believe that a viper was begotten by a god (thus Orpheus:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="v.ii.xx-p3.1"></A> &#8220;But from the sacred womb Phanes begat<br>  Another offspring, horrible and fierce,<br>  In sight a frightful viper, on whose head<br>  Were hairs: its face was comely; but the rest,<br>  From the neck downwards, bore the aspect dire<br>  Of a dread dragon&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_763"></A><A HREF="#fn_763"><FONT SIZE="1">764</FONT></A>
);<br>  </blockquote>  
<p class="continue"><a name="v.ii.xx-p5"></A>or who will admit that Phanes himself, being a first-born god (for he it was that was produced from the egg), has the body or shape of a dragon, or was swallowed by Zeus, that Zeus might be too large to be contained? For if they differ in no respect from the lowest brutes (since it is evident that the Deity must differ from the things of earth and those that are derived from matter), they are not gods. How, then, I ask, can we approach them as suppliants, when their origin resembles that of cattle, and they themselves have the form of brutes, and are ugly to behold?</p>
