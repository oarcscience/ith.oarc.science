<p> <a name="iv.ii.ii.xii"></A> <h5 align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ii.xii-p0.1"></A>Chapter XII.&#8212;The Glory of the Six Days&#146; Work.</h5>  
<p><a name="iv.ii.ii.xii-p1"></A>Of this six days&#146; work no man can give a worthy explanation and description of all its parts, not though he had ten thousand tongues and ten thousand mouths; nay, though he were to live ten thousand years, sojourning in this life, not even so could he utter anything worthy of these things, on account of the exceeding greatness and riches of the wisdom of God which there is in the six days&#146; work above narrated. Many writers indeed have imitated [the narration], and essayed to give an explanation of these things; yet, though they thence derived some suggestions, both concerning the creation of the world and the nature of man, they have emitted no slightest spark of truth. And the utterances of the philosophers, and writers, and poets have an appearance of trustworthiness, on account of the beauty of their diction; but their discourse is proved to be foolish and idle, because the multitude of their nonsensical frivolities is very great; and not a stray morsel of truth is found in them. For even if any truth seems to have been uttered by them, it has a mixture of error. And as a deleterious drug, when mixed with honey or wine, or some other thing, makes the whole [mixture] hurtful and profitless; so also eloquence is in their case found to be labour in vain; yea, rather an injurious thing to those who credit it. Moreover, [they spoke] concerning the seventh day, which all men acknowledge; but the most know not that what among the Hebrews is called the &#8220;Sabbath,&#8221; is translated into Greek the &#8220;Seventh&#8221; (<span class="Greek"><a name="iv.ii.ii.xii-p1.1"></A>&#7953;&#946;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#8049;&#962;</span>), a name which is adopted by every nation, although they know not the reason of the appellation. And as for what the poet Hesiod says of Erebus being produced from chaos, as well as the earth and love which lords it over <i>his</i> [Hesiod&#146;s] gods and men, his dictum is shown to be idle and frigid, and quite foreign to the truth. For it is not meet that God be conquered by pleasure; since even men of temperance abstain from all base pleasure and wicked lust.</p>
