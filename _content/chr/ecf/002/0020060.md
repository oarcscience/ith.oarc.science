##### <span id="iii.ii.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Of the Other Public Amusements.

<span id="iii.ii.xxiv-p1"></span>What advantage should I gain from him
who is brought on the stage by Euripides raving mad, and acting the
matricide of Alcmæon; who does not even retain his natural behaviour,
but with his mouth wide open goes about sword in hand, and, screaming
aloud, is burned to death, habited in a robe unfit for man? Away, too,
with the mythical tales of Acusilaus, and Menander, a versifier of the
same class! And why should I admire the mythic piper? Why should I busy
myself about the Theban Antigenides, <span
id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487) like Aristoxenus? We leave you to
these worthless things; and do you either believe our doctrines, or,
like us, give up yours.
