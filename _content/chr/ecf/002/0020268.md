##### <span id="vi.iii.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—How to Conduct Ourselves at Feasts.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.iv-p1"></span>Let revelry keep away from our
rational entertainments, and foolish vigils, too, that revel in
intemperance. For revelry is an inebriating pipe, the chain <span
id="fr_1399"></span>[1400](#fn_1399) of an amatory bridge, that is, of
sorrow. And let love, and intoxication, and senseless passions, be
removed from our choir. Burlesque singing is the boon companion of
drunkenness. A night spent over drink invites drunkenness, rouses lust,
and is audacious in deeds of shame. For if people occupy their time with
pipes, and psalteries, and choirs, and dances, and Egyptian clapping of
hands, and such disorderly frivolities, they become quite immodest and
intractable, beat on cymbals and drums, and make a noise on instruments
of delusion; for plainly such a banquet, as seems to me, is a theatre of
drunkenness. For the apostle decrees that, “putting off the works of
darkness, we should put on the armour of light, walking honestly as in
the day, not spending our time in rioting and drunkenness, in chambering
and wantonness.” <span id="fr_1400"></span>[1401](#fn_1400) Let the pipe
be resigned to the shepherds, and the flute to the superstitious who are
engrossed in idolatry. For, in truth, such instruments are to be
banished from the temperate banquet, being more suitable to beasts than
men, and the more irrational portion of mankind. For we have heard of
stags being charmed by the pipe, and seduced by music into the toils,
when hunted by the huntsmen. And when mares are being covered, a tune is
played on the flute—a nuptial song, as it were. And every improper sight
and sound, to speak in a word, and every shameful sensation of
licentiousnes—which, in truth, is privation of sensation—must by all
means be excluded; and we must be on our guard against whatever pleasure
titillates eye and ear, and effeminates. For the various spells of the
broken strains and plaintive numbers of the Carian muse corrupt men’s
morals, drawing to perturbation of mind, by the licentious and
mischievous art of music. <span id="fr_1401"></span>[1402](#fn_1401)

<span id="vi.iii.ii.iv-p5"></span>The Spirit, distinguishing from such
revelry the divine service, sings, “Praise Him with the sound of
trumpet;” for with sound of trumpet He shall raise the dead. “Praise Him
on the psaltery;” for the tongue is the psaltery of the Lord. “And
praise Him on the lyre.” <span id="fr_1402"></span>[1403](#fn_1402) By
the lyre is meant the mouth struck by the Spirit, as it were by a
plectrum. “Praise with the timbrel and the dance,” refers to the Church
meditating on the resurrection of the dead in the resounding skin.
“Praise Him on the chords and organ.” Our body He calls an organ, and
its nerves are the strings, by which it has received harmonious tension,
and when struck by the Spirit, it gives forth human voices. “Praise Him
on the clashing cymbals.” He calls the tongue the cymbal of the mouth,
which resounds with the pulsation of the lips. Therefore He cried to
humanity, “Let every breath praise the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iii.ii.iv-p6.2"></span>Lord</span>,” because He cares for every
breathing thing which He hath made. For man is truly a pacific
instrument; while other instruments, if you investigate, you will find
to be warlike, inflaming to lusts, or kindling up amours, or rousing
wrath.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.iv-p7"></span>In their wars, therefore, the
Etruscans use the trumpet, the Arcadians the pipe, the Sicilians the
<span id="page_249">p. 249</span> <span
id="vi.iii.ii.iv-Page_249"></span>pectides, the Cretans the lyre, the
Lacedæmonians the flute, the Thracians the horn, the Egyptians the drum,
and the Arabians the cymbal. The one instrument of peace, the Word alone
by which we honour God, is what we employ. We no longer employ the
ancient psaltery, and trumpet, and timbrel, and flute, which those
expert in war and contemners of the fear of God were wont to make use of
also in the choruses at their festive assemblies; that by such strains
they might raise their dejected minds. But let our genial feeling in
drinking be twofold, in accordance with the law. For “if thou shalt love
the Lord thy God,” and then “thy neighbour,” let its first manifestation
be towards God in thanksgiving and psalmody, and the second toward our
neighbour in decorous fellowship. For says the apostle, “Let the Word of
the Lord dwell in you richly.” <span
id="fr_1403"></span>[1404](#fn_1403) And this Word suits and conforms
Himself to seasons, to persons, to places.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.iv-p9"></span>In the present instance He is a guest
with us. For the apostle adds again, “Teaching and admonishing one
another in all wisdom, in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs,
singing with grace in your heart to God.” And again, “Whatsoever ye do
in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to
God and His Father.” This is our thankful revelry. And even if you wish
to sing and play to the harp or lyre, there is no blame. <span
id="fr_1404"></span>[1405](#fn_1404) Thou shalt imitate the righteous
Hebrew king in his thanksgiving to God. “Rejoice in the Lord, ye
righteous; praise is comely to the upright,” <span
id="fr_1405"></span>[1406](#fn_1405) says the prophecy. “Confess to the
Lord on the harp; play to Him on the psaltery of ten strings. Sing to
Him a new song.” And does not the ten-stringed psaltery indicate the
Word Jesus, who is manifested by the element of the decad? And as it is
befitting, before partaking of food, that we should bless the Creator of
all; so also in drinking it is suitable to praise Him on partaking of
His creatures. <span id="fr_1406"></span>[1407](#fn_1406) For the psalm
is a melodious and sober blessing. The apostle calls the psalm “a
spiritual song.” <span id="fr_1407"></span>[1408](#fn_1407)

<span id="vi.iii.ii.iv-p14"></span>Finally, before partaking of sleep,
it is a sacred duty to give thanks to God, having enjoyed His grace and
love, and so go straight to sleep. <span
id="fr_1408"></span>[1409](#fn_1408) “And confess to Him in songs of the
lips,” he says, “because in His command all His good pleasure is done,
and there is no deficiency in His salvation.” <span
id="fr_1409"></span>[1410](#fn_1409)

<span id="vi.iii.ii.iv-p17"></span>Further, among the ancient Greeks, in
their banquets over the brimming cups, a song was sung called a skolion,
after the manner of the Hebrew psalms, all together raising the pæan
with the voice, and sometimes also taking turns in the song while they
drank healths round; while those that were more musical than the rest
sang to the lyre. But let amatory songs be banished far away, and let
our songs be hymns to God. “Let them praise,” it is said, “His name in
the dance, and let them play to Him on the timbrel and psaltery.” <span
id="fr_1410"></span>[1411](#fn_1410) And what is the choir which plays?
The Spirit will show thee: “Let His praise be in the congregation
(church) of the saints; let them be joyful in their King.” <span
id="fr_1411"></span>[1412](#fn_1411) And again he adds, “The <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iii.ii.iv-p19.2"></span>Lord</span> will take
pleasure in His people.” <span id="fr_1412"></span>[1413](#fn_1412) For
temperate harmonies <span id="fr_1413"></span>[1414](#fn_1413) are to be
admitted; but we are to banish as far as possible from our robust mind
those liquid harmonies, which, through pernicious arts in the
modulations of tones, train to effeminacy and scurrility. But grave and
modest strains say farewell to the turbulence of drunkenness. <span
id="fr_1414"></span>[1415](#fn_1414) Chromatic harmonies are therefore
to be abandoned to immodest revels, and to florid and meretricious
music.
