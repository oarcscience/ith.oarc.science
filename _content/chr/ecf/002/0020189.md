##### <span id="v.ii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—The Philosophers Agree with the Poets Respecting the Gods.

<span id="v.ii.xix-p1"></span>Such was the beginning of the existence
both of their gods and of the universe. Now what are we to make of this?
For each of those things to which divinity is ascribed is conceived of
as having existed from the first. For, if they have come into being,
having previously had no existence, as those say who treat of the gods,
they do not exist. For, a thing is either uncreated and eternal, or
created and perishable. Nor do I think one thing and the philosophers
another. “What is that which always is, and has no origin; or what is
that which has been originated, yet never is?” <span
id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759) Discoursing of the intelligible and
the sensible, Plato teaches that <span id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span
id="v.ii.xix-Page_138"></span>that which always is, the intelligible, is
unoriginated, but that which is not, the sensible, is originated,
beginning to be and ceasing to exist. In like manner, the Stoics also
say that all things will be burnt up and will again exist, the world
receiving another beginning. But if, although there is, according to
them, a twofold cause, one active and governing, namely providence, the
other passive and changeable, namely matter, it is nevertheless
impossible for the world, even though under the care of Providence, to
remain in the same state, because it is created—how can the constitution
of these gods remain, who are not self-existent, <span
id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760) but have been originated? And in what
are the gods superior to matter, since they derive their constitution
from water? But not even water, according to them, is the beginning of
all things. From simple and homogeneous elements what could be
constituted? Moreover, matter requires an artificer, and the artificer
requires matter. For how could figures be made without matter or an
artificer? Neither, again, is it reasonable that matter should be older
than God; for the efficient cause must of necessity exist before the
things that are made.
