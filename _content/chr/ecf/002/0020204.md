##### <span id="v.ii.xxxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—The Vast Difference in Morals Between the Christians and Their Accusers.

<span id="v.ii.xxxiv-p1"></span>But though such is our character (Oh!
why should I speak of things unfit to be uttered?), the things said of
us are an example of the proverb, “The harlot reproves the chaste.” For
those who have set up a market for fornication and established infamous
resorts for the young for every kind of vile pleasure,—who do not
abstain even from males, males with males committing shocking
abominations, outraging all the noblest and comeliest bodies in all
sorts of ways, so dishonouring the fair workmanship of God (for beauty
on earth is not self-made, but sent hither by the hand and will of
God),—these men, I say, revile us for the very things which they are
conscious of themselves, and ascribe to their own gods, boasting of them
as noble deeds, and worthy of the gods. These adulterers and pæderasts
defame the eunuchs and the once-married (while they themselves live like
fishes; <span id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828) for these gulp down
whatever falls in their way, and the stronger chases the weaker: and, in
fact, this is to feed upon human flesh, to do violence in contravention
of the very laws which you and your ancestors, with due care for all
that is fair and right, have enacted), so that not even the governors of
the provinces sent by you suffice for the hearing of the complaints
against those, to whom it even is not lawful, when they are struck, not
to offer themselves for more blows, nor when defamed not to bless: for
it is not enough to be just (and justice is to return like for like),
but it is incumbent on us to be good and patient of evil.
