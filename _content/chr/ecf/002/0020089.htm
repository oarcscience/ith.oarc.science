<p><a name="iv.ii.i.vi-p1"></A>Consider, O man, His works,&#8212;the timely rotation of the seasons, and the changes of temperature; the regular march of the stars; the well-ordered course of days and nights, and months, and years; the various beauty of seeds, and plants, and fruits; and the divers species&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_532"></A><A HREF="#fn_532"><FONT SIZE="1">533</FONT></A>
 of quadrupeds, and birds, and reptiles, and fishes, both of the rivers and of the sea; or consider the instinct implanted in these animals to beget and rear offspring, not for their own profit, but for the use of man; and the providence with which God provides nourishment for all flesh, or the subjection in which He has ordained that all things subserve mankind. Consider, too, the flowing of sweet fountains and never-failing rivers, and the seasonable supply of dews, and showers, and rains; the manifold movement of the heavenly bodies, the morning star rising and heralding the approach of the perfect luminary; and the constellation of Pleiades, and Orion, and Arcturus, and the orbit of the other stars that circle through the heavens, all of which the manifold wisdom of   <A NAME="page_91"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 91</FONT></A> <a name="iv.ii.i.vi-Page_91"></A>God has called by names of their own. He is God alone who made light out of darkness, and brought forth light from His treasures, and formed the chambers of the south wind,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_533"></A><A HREF="#fn_533"><FONT SIZE="1">534</FONT></A>
 and the treasure-houses of the deep, and the bounds of the seas, and the treasuries of snows and hail-storms, collecting the waters in the storehouses of the deep, and the darkness in His treasures, and bringing forth the sweet, and desirable, and pleasant light out of His treasures; &#8220;who causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: He maketh lightnings for the rain;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_534"></A><A HREF="#fn_534"><FONT SIZE="1">535</FONT></A>
 who sends forth His thunder to terrify, and foretells by the lightning the peal of the thunder, that no soul may faint with the sudden shock; and who so moderates the violence of the lightning as it flashes out of heaven, that it does not consume the earth; for, if the lightning were allowed all its power, it would burn up the earth; and were the thunder allowed all its power, it would overthrow all the works that are therein.</p>
