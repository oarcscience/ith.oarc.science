<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The Heathens Made Gods Like Themselves, Whence Springs All Superstition.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p1"></span>Now, as the Greeks represent the gods
as possessing human forms, so also do they as possessing human passions.
And as each of them <span id="page_529">p. 529</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vii.iv-Page_529"></span>depict their forms similar to
themselves, as Xenophanes says, “Ethiopians as black and apes, the
Thracians ruddy and tawny;” so also they assimilate their souls to those
who form them: the Barbarians, for instance, who make them savage and
wild; and the Greeks, who make them more civilized, yet subject to
passion.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p2"></span>Wherefore it stands to reason, that
the ideas entertained of God by wicked men must be bad, and those by
good men most excellent. And therefore he who is in soul truly kingly
and gnostic, being likewise pious and free from superstition, is
persuaded that He who alone is God is honourable, venerable, august,
beneficent, the doer of good, the author of all good things, but not the
cause of evil. And respecting the Hellenic superstition we have, as I
think, shown enough in the book entitled by us *The Exhortation,*
availing ourselves abundantly of the history bearing on the point. There
is no need, then, again to make a long story of what has already been
clearly stated. But in as far as necessity requires to be pointed out on
coming to the topic, suffice it to adduce a few out of many
considerations in proof of the impiety of those who make the Divinity
resemble the worst men. For either those Gods of theirs are injured by
men, and are shown to be inferior to men on being injured by us; or, if
not so, how is it that they are incensed at those by whom they are not
injured, like a testy old wife roused to wrath?

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p3"></span>As they say that Artemis was enraged
at the Ætolians on account of Œneus. <span
id="fr_3538"></span>[3539](#fn_3538) For how, being a goddess, did she
not consider that he had neglected to sacrifice, not through contempt,
but out of inadvertence, or under the idea that he had sacrificed?

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p5"></span>And Latona, <span
id="fr_3539"></span>[3540](#fn_3539) arguing her case with Athene, on
account of the latter being incensed at her for having brought forth in
the temple, says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p6.3"></span> “Man-slaying spoils  
> Torn from the dead you love to see. And these  
> To you are not unclean. But you regard  
> My parturition here a horrid thing,  
> Though other creatures in the temple do  
> No harm by bringing forth their young.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p7"></span>It is natural, then, that having a
superstitious dread of those irascible \[gods\], they imagine that all
events are signs and causes of evils. If a mouse bore through an altar
built of clay, and for want of something else gnaw through an oil flask;
if a cock that is being fattened crow in the evening, they determine
this to be a sign of something.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p8"></span>Of such a one Menander gives a comic
description in *The Superstitious Man:*—

> <span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p8.1"></span> “*A.* Good luck be mine, ye
> honoured gods!  
> Tying my, right shoe’s string,  
> I broke it.”  
> “*B.* Most likely, silly fool,  
> For it was rotten, and you, niggard, you  
> Would not buy new ones.” <span id="fr_3540"></span>[3541](#fn_3540)  

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p10"></span>It was a clever remark of Antiphon,
who (when one regarded it as an ill omen that the sow had eaten her
pigs), on seeing her emaciated through the niggardliness of the person
that kept her, said, Congratulate yourself on the omen that, being so
hungry, she did not eat your own children.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p11"></span>“And what wonder is it,” says Bion,
“if the mouse, finding nothing to eat, gnaws the bag?” For it were
wonderful if (as Arcesilaus argued in fun) “the bag had eaten the
mouse.”

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p12"></span>Diogenes accordingly remarked well to
one who wondered at finding a serpent coiled round a pestle: “Don’t
wonder; for it would have been more surprising if you had seen the
pestle coiled round the serpent, and the serpent straight.”

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p13"></span>For the irrational creatures must
run, and scamper, and fight, and breed, and die; and these things being
natural to them, can never be unnatural to us.

> <span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p13.1"></span> “And many birds beneath the
> sunbeams walk.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p14"></span>And the comic poet Philemon treats
such points in comedy:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p14.1"></span> “When I see one who watches who
> has sneezed,  
> Or who has spoke; or looking, who goes on,  
> I straightway in the market sell him off.  
> Each one of us walks, talks, and sneezes too,  
> For his own self, not for the citizens:  
> According to their nature things turn out.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p15"></span>Then by the practice of temperance
men seek health: and by cramming themselves, and wallowing in potations
at feasts, they attract diseases.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p16"></span>There are many, too, that dread
inscriptions set up. Very cleverly Diogenes, on finding in the house of
a bad man the inscription, “Hercules, for victory famed, dwells here;
let nothing bad enter,” remarked, “And how shall the master of the house
go in?”

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p17"></span>The same people, who worship every
stick and greasy stone, as the saying is, dreads tufts of tawny wool,
and lumps of salt, and torches, and squills, and sulphur, bewitched by
sorcerers, in certain impure rites of expiation. But God, the true God,
recognises as holy only the character of the righteous man,—as unholy,
wrong and wickedness.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p18"></span>You may see the eggs, <span
id="fr_3541"></span>[3542](#fn_3541) taken from those who have been
purified, hatched if subjected to the necessary warmth. But this could
not take <span id="page_530">p. 530</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vii.iv-Page_530"></span>place if they had had transferred to
them the sins of the man that had undergone purification. Accordingly
the comic poet Diphilus facetiously writes, in comedy, of sorcerers, in
the following words:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p19.3"></span> “Purifying Prœtus’ daughters,
> and their father  
> Prœtus Abantades, and fifth, an old wife to boot,  
> So many people’s persons with one torch, one squill,  
> With sulphur and asphalt of the loud-sounding sea,  
> From the placid-flowing, deep-flowing ocean.  
> But blest air through the clouds send Anticyra  
> That I may make this bug into a drone.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p20"></span>For well Menander remarks: <span
id="fr_3542"></span>[3543](#fn_3542) —

> <span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p21.1"></span> “Had you, O Phidias, any real
> ill,  
> You needs must seek for it a real cure;  
> Now ’tis not so. And for the unreal ill  
> I’ve found an unreal cure. Believe that it  
> Will do thee good. Let women in a ring  
> Wipe thee, and from three fountains water bring.  
> Add salt and lentils; sprinkle then thyself.  
> Each one is pure, who’s conscious of no sin.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p22"></span>For instance, the tragedy says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p22.1"></span> *Menelaus*. “What disease,
> Orestes, is destroying thee?”  
> *Orestes*. “Conscience. For horrid deeds I know I’ve done.” <span
> id="fr_3543"></span>[3544](#fn_3543)  

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p24"></span>For in reality there is no other
purity but abstinence from sins. Excellently then Epicharmus says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p24.1"></span> “If a pure mind thou hast,  
> In thy whole body thou art pure.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iv-p25"></span>Now also we say that it is requisite
to purify the soul from corrupt and bad doctrines by right reason; and
so thereafter to the recollection of the principal heads of doctrine.
Since also before the communication of the mysteries they think it right
to apply certain purifications to those who are to be initiated; so it
is requisite for men to abandon impious opinion, and thus turn to the
true tradition.
