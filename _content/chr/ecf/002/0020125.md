##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—The Nature of Man.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxvii-p1"></span>But some one will say to us, Was man
made by nature mortal? Certainly not. Was he, then, immortal? Neither do
we affirm this. But one will say, Was he, then, nothing? Not even this
hits the mark. He was by nature neither mortal nor immortal. For if He
had made him immortal from the beginning, He would have made him God.
Again, if He had made him mortal, God would seem to be the cause of his
death. Neither, then, immortal nor yet mortal did He make him, but, as
we have said above, capable of both; so that if he should incline to the
things of immortality, keeping the commandment of God, he should receive
as reward from Him immortality, and should become God; but if, on the
other hand, he should turn to the things of death, disobeying God, he
should himself be the cause of death to himself. For God made man free,
and with power over himself. <span id="fr_602"></span>[603](#fn_602)
That, then, which man brought upon himself through carelessness and
disobedience, this God now vouchsafes to him as a gift through His own
philanthropy and pity, when men obey Him. <span
id="fr_603"></span>[604](#fn_603) For as man, disobeying, drew death
upon himself; so, obeying the will of God, he who desires is able to
procure for himself life everlasting. For God has given us a law and
holy commandments; and every one who keeps these can be saved, and,
obtaining the resurrection, can inherit incorruption.

αὐτεξούσιον ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον</span>.\]

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxvii-p3"></span> Apparently meaning, that God turns
death, which man brought on himself by disobedience, into a blessing.
