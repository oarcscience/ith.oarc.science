##### <span id="vi.iii.iii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—The Christian Alone Rich.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.vi-p1"></span>Riches are then to be partaken of
rationally, bestowed lovingly, not sordidly, or pompously; nor is the
love of the beautiful to be turned into self-love and ostentation; lest
perchance some one say to us, “His horse, or land, or domestic, or gold,
is worth fifteen talents; but the man himself is dear at three coppers.”

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.vi-Page_280"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.vi-p2"></span>Take away, then, directly the
ornaments from women, and domestics from masters, and you will find
masters in no respect different from bought slaves in step, or look, or
voice, so like are they to their slaves. But they differ in that they
are feebler than their slaves, and have a more sickly upbringing.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.vi-p3"></span>This best of maxims, then, ought to
be perpetually repeated, “That the good man, being temperate and just,”
treasures up his wealth in heaven. He who has sold his worldly goods,
and given them to the poor, finds the imperishable treasure, “where is
neither moth nor robber.” Blessed truly is he, “though he be
insignificant, and feeble, and obscure;” and he is truly rich with the
greatest of all riches. “Though a man, then, be richer than Cinyras and
Midas, and is wicked,” and haughty as he who was luxuriously clothed in
purple and fine linen, and despised Lazarus, “he is miserable, and lives
in trouble,” and shall not live. Wealth seems to me to be like a
serpent, which will twist round the hand and bite; unless one knows how
to lay hold of it without danger by the point of the tail. And riches,
wriggling either in an experienced or inexperienced grasp, are dexterous
at adhering and biting; unless one, despising them, use them skilfully,
so as to crush the creature by the charm of the Word, and himself escape
unscathed.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.vi-p4"></span>But, as is reasonable, he alone, who
possesses what is worth most, turns out truly rich, though not
recognised as such. And it is not jewels, or gold, or clothing, or
beauty of person, that are of high value, but virtue; which is the Word
given by the Instructor to be put in practice. This is the Word, who
abjures luxury, but calls self-help as a servant, and praises frugality,
the progeny of temperance. “Receive,” he says, “instruction, and not
silver, and knowledge rather than tested gold; for Wisdom is better than
precious stones, nor is anything that is valuable equal in worth to
her.” <span id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632) And again: “Acquire me
rather than gold, and precious stones, and silver; for my produce is
better than choice silver.” <span id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.vi-p7"></span>But if we must distinguish, let it be
granted that he is rich who has many possessions, loaded with gold like
a dirty purse; but the righteous alone is graceful, because grace is
order, observing a due and decorous measure in managing and
distributing. “For there are those who sow and reap more,” <span
id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634) of whom it is written, “He hath
dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for
ever.” <span id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635) So that it is not he
who has and keeps, but he who gives away, that is rich; and it is giving
away, not possession, which renders a man happy; and the fruit of the
Spirit is generosity. It is in the soul, then, that riches are. Let it,
then, be granted that good things are the property only of good men; and
Christians are good. Now, a fool or a libertine can neither have any
perception of what is good, nor obtain possession of it. Accordingly,
good things are possessed by Christians alone. And nothing is richer
than these good things; therefore these alone are rich. For
righteousness is true riches; and the Word is more valuable than all
treasure, not accruing from cattle and fields, but given by God—riches
which cannot be taken away. The soul alone is its treasure. It is the
best possession to its possessor, rendering man truly blessed. For he
whose it is to desire nothing that is not in our power, and to obtain by
asking from God what he piously desires, does he not possess much, nay
all, having God as his everlasting treasure? “To him that asks,” it is
said, “shall be given, and to him that knocketh it shall be
opened.” <span id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636) If God denies
nothing, all things belong to the godly.
