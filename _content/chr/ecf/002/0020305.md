##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.—The Mysteries of the Faith Not to Be Divulged to All.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xii-p1"></span>But since this tradition is not
published alone for him who perceives the magnificence of the word; it
is requisite, therefore, to hide in a mystery the wisdom spoken, which
the Son of God taught. Now, therefore, Isaiah the prophet has his tongue
purified by fire, so that he may be able to tell the vision. And we must
purify not the tongue alone, but also the ears, if we attempt to be
partakers of the truth.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xii-p2"></span>Such were the impediments in the way of
my writing. And even now I fear, as it is said, “to cast the pearls
before swine, lest they tread them under foot, and turn and rend
us.” <span id="fr_1939"></span>[1940](#fn_1939) For it is difficult to
exhibit the really pure and transparent words respecting the true light,
to swinish and untrained hearers. For scarcely could anything which they
could hear be more ludicrous than these to the multitude; nor any
subjects <span id="page_313">p. 313</span> <span
id="vi.iv.i.xii-Page_313"></span>on the other hand more admirable or
more inspiring to those of noble nature. “But the natural man receiveth
not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness to
him.” <span id="fr_1940"></span>[1941](#fn_1940) But the wise do not
utter with their mouth what they reason in council. “But what ye hear in
the ear,” says the Lord, “proclaim upon the houses;” <span
id="fr_1941"></span>[1942](#fn_1941) bidding them receive the secret
traditions <span id="fr_1942"></span>[1943](#fn_1942) of the true
knowledge, and expound them aloft and conspicuously; and as we have
heard in the ear, so to deliver them to whom it is requisite; but not
enjoining us to communicate to all without distinction, what is said to
them in parables. But there is only a delineation in the memoranda,
which have the truth sowed sparse <span
id="fr_1943"></span>[1944](#fn_1943) and broadcast, that it may escape
the notice of those who pick up seeds like jackdaws; but when they find
a good husbandman, each one of them will germinate and produce corn.
