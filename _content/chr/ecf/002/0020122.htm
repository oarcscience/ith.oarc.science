<p><a name="iv.ii.ii.xxiv-p1"></A>God, then, caused to spring out of the earth every tree that is beautiful in appearance, or good for food. For at first there were only those things which were produced on the third day,&#8212;plants, and seeds, and herbs; but the things which were in Paradise were made of a   <A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A> <a name="iv.ii.ii.xxiv-Page_104"></A>superior loveliness and beauty, since in it the plants were said to have been planted by God. As to the rest of the plants, indeed, the world contained plants like them; but the two trees,&#8212;the tree of life and the tree of knowledge,&#8212;the rest of the earth possessed not, but only Paradise. And that Paradise is earth, and is planted on the earth, the Scripture states, saying:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_598"></A><A HREF="#fn_598"><FONT SIZE="1">599</FONT></A>
 &#8220;And the <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ii.ii.xxiv-p2.2"></A>Lord</span> God planted Paradise in Eden eastwards, and placed man there; and out of the ground made the <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ii.ii.xxiv-p2.3"></A>Lord</span> God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food.&#8221; By the expressions, therefore, &#8220;out of the ground,&#8221; and &#8220;eastwards,&#8221; the holy writing clearly teaches us that Paradise is under this heaven, under which the east and the earth are. And the Hebrew word Eden signifies &#8220;delight.&#8221; And it was signified that a river flowed out of Eden to water Paradise, and after that divides into four heads; of which the two called Pison and Gihon water the eastern parts, especially Gihon, which encompasses the whole land of Ethiopia, and which, they say, reappears in Egypt under the name of Nile. And the other two rivers are manifestly recognisable by us&#8212;those called Tigris and Euphrates&#8212;for these border on our own regions. And God having placed man in Paradise, as has been said, to till and keep it, commanded him to eat of all the trees,&#8212;manifestly of the tree of life also; but only of the tree of knowledge He commanded him not to taste. And God transferred him from the earth, out of which he had been produced, into Paradise, giving him means of advancement, in order that, maturing and becoming perfect, and being even declared a god, he might thus ascend into heaven in possession of immortality. For man had been made a middle nature, neither wholly mortal, nor altogether immortal, but capable of either; so also the place, Paradise, was made in respect of beauty intermediate between earth and heaven. And by the expression, &#8220;till it,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_599"></A><A HREF="#fn_599"><FONT SIZE="1">600</FONT></A>
 no other kind of labour is implied than the observance of God&#146;s command, lest, disobeying, he should destroy himself, as indeed he did destroy himself, by sin.</p>
