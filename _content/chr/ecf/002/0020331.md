##### <span id="vi.iv.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The Utility of Fear. Objections Answered.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.vii-p1"></span>Those, who denounce fear, assail the
law; and if the law, plainly also God, who gave the law. For these three
elements are of necessity presented in the subject on hand: the ruler,
his administration, and the ruled. If, then, according to hypothesis,
they abolish the law; then, by necessary consequence, each one who is
led by lust, courting pleasure, must neglect what is right and despise
the Deity, and fearlessly indulge in impiety and injustice together,
having dashed away from the truth.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.vii-p2"></span>Yea, say they, fear is an irrational
aberration, <span id="fr_2222"></span>[2223](#fn_2222) and perturbation
of mind. What sayest thou? And how can this definition be any longer
maintained, seeing the commandment is given me by the Word? But the
commandment forbids, hanging fear over the head of those who have
incurred <span id="fr_2223"></span>[2224](#fn_2223) admonition for their
discipline.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.vii-p5"></span>Fear is not then irrational. It is
therefore rational. How could it be otherwise, exhorting as it does,
*Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not
steal, Than shalt not bear false witness?* But if they will quibble
about the names, let the philosophers term the fear of the law, cautious
fear, (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.vii-p5.1"></span>εὐλάβεια</span>) <span id="page_355">p.
355</span> <span id="vi.iv.ii.vii-Page_355"></span>which is a shunning
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.vii-p5.2"></span>ἔκκλισις</span>) agreeable to reason. Such
Critolaus of Phasela not inaptly called fighters about names (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.ii.vii-p5.3"></span>ὀνοματομάκοι</span>).
The commandment, then, has already appeared fair and lovely even in the
highest degree, when conceived under a change of name. Cautious fear
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.vii-p5.4"></span>εὐλάβεια</span>) is therefore shown to be
reasonable, being the shunning of what hurts; from which arises
repentance for previous sins. “For the fear of the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.ii.vii-p5.5"></span>Lord</span> is the
beginning of wisdom; good understanding is to all that do it.” <span
id="fr_2224"></span>[2225](#fn_2224) He calls wisdom a doing, which is
the fear of the Lord paving the way for wisdom. But if the law produces
fear, the knowledge of the law is the beginning of wisdom; and a man is
not wise without law. Therefore those who reject the law are unwise; and
in consequence they are reckoned godless (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.vii-p6.2"></span>ἄθεοι</span>). Now instruction is the
beginning of wisdom. “But the ungodly despise wisdom and
instruction,” <span id="fr_2225"></span>[2226](#fn_2225) saith the
Scripture.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.vii-p8"></span>Let us see what terrors the law
announces. If it is the things which hold an intermediate place between
virtue and vice, such as poverty, disease, obscurity, and humble birth,
and the like, these things civil laws hold forth, and are praised for so
doing. And those of the Peripatetic school, who introduce three kinds of
good things, and think that their opposites are evil, this opinion
suits. But the law given to us enjoins us to shun what are in reality
bad things—adultery, uncleanness, pæderasty, ignorance, wickedness,
soul-disease, death (not that which severs the soul from the body, but
that which severs the soul from truth). For these are vices in reality,
and the workings that proceed from them are dreadful and terrible. “For
not unjustly,” say the divine oracles, “are the nets spread for birds;
for they who are accomplices in blood treasure up evils to
themselves.” <span id="fr_2226"></span>[2227](#fn_2226) How, then, is
the law still said to be not good by certain heresies that clamorously
appeal to the apostle, who says, “For by the law is the knowledge of
sin?” <span id="fr_2227"></span>[2228](#fn_2227) To whom we say, The law
did not cause, but showed sin. For, enjoining what is to be done, it
reprehended what ought not to be done. And it is the part of the good to
teach what is salutary, and to point out what is deleterious; and to
counsel the practice of the one, and to command to shun the other. Now
the apostle, whom they do not comprehend, said that by the law the
knowledge of sin was manifested, not that from it it derived its
existence. And how can the law be not good, which trains, which is given
as the instructor (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.vii-p10.2"></span>παιδαγωγός</span>) to Christ, <span
id="fr_2228"></span>[2229](#fn_2228) that being corrected by fear, in
the way of discipline, in order to the attainment of the perfection
which is by Christ? “I will not,” it is said, “the death of the sinner,
as his repentance.” <span id="fr_2229"></span>[2230](#fn_2229) Now the
commandment works repentance; inasmuch as it deters <span
id="fr_2230"></span>[2231](#fn_2230) from what ought not to be done, and
enjoins good deeds. By ignorance he means, in my opinion, death. “And he
that is near the Lord is full of stripes.” <span
id="fr_2231"></span>[2232](#fn_2231) Plainly, he, that draws near to
knowledge, has the benefit of perils, fears, troubles, afflictions, by
reason of his desire for the truth. “For the son who is instructed turns
out wise, and an intelligent son is saved from burning. And an
intelligent son will receive the commandments.” <span
id="fr_2232"></span>[2233](#fn_2232) And Barnabas the apostle having
said, “Woe to those who are wise in their own conceits, clever in their
own eyes,” <span id="fr_2233"></span>[2234](#fn_2233) added, “Let us
become spiritual, a perfect temple to God; let us, as far as in us lies,
practice the fear of God, and strive to keep His commands, that we may
rejoice in His judgments.” <span id="fr_2234"></span>[2235](#fn_2234)
Whence “the fear of God” is divinely said to be the beginning of
wisdom. <span id="fr_2235"></span>[2236](#fn_2235)
