##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Accurate Account of the Deluge.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xix-p1"></span>And neither does he make out that
there was a second flood: on the contrary, he said that never again
would there be a flood of water on the world; as neither indeed has
there been, nor ever shall be. And he says that eight human beings were
preserved in the ark, in that which had been prepared by God’s
direction, not by Deucalion, but by Noah; which Hebrew word means in
English <span id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676) “rest,” as we have
elsewhere shown that Noah, when he announced to the men then alive that
there was a flood coming, prophesied to them, saying, Come thither, God
calls you to repentance. On this account he was fitly called
Deucalion. <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677) And this Noah had
three sons (as we mentioned in the second book), whose names <span
id="page_117">p. 117</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii.xix-Page_117"></span>were Shem, and Ham, and Japhet; and
these had three wives, one wife each; each man and his wife. This man
some have surnamed Eunuchus. All the eight persons, therefore, who were
found in the ark were preserved. And Moses showed that the flood lasted
forty days and forty nights, torrents pouring from heaven, and from the
fountains of the deep breaking up, so that the water overtopped every
high hill 15 cubits. And thus the race of all the men that then were was
destroyed, and those only who were protected in the ark were saved; and
these, we have already said, were eight. And of the ark, the remains are
to this day to be seen in the Arabian mountains. This, then, is in sum
the history of the deluge.
