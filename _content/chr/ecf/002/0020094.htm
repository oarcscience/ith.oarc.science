<p><a name="iv.ii.i.xi-p1"></A>Wherefore I will rather honour the king [than your gods], not, indeed, worshipping him, but praying for him. But God, the living and true God, I worship, knowing that the king is made by Him. You will say, then, to me, &#8220;Why do you not worship the king?&#8221; Because he is not made to be worshipped, but to be reverenced with lawful honour, for he is not a god, but a man appointed by God, not to be worshipped, but to judge justly. For in a kind of way his government is committed to him by God: as He will not have those called kings whom He has appointed under Himself; for &#8220;king&#8221; is his title, and it is not lawful for another to use it; so neither is it lawful for any to be worshipped but God only. Wherefore, O man, you are wholly in error. Accordingly, honour the king, be subject to him, and pray for him with loyal mind; for if you do this, you do the will of God. For the law that is of God, says, &#8220;My son, fear thou the Lord and the king, and be not disobedient to them; for suddenly they shall take vengeance on their enemies.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_539"></A><A HREF="#fn_539"><FONT SIZE="1">540</FONT></A>
