<span id="v.ii.xviii"></span>

##### <span id="v.ii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—The Gods Themselves Have Been Created, as the Poets Confess.

<span id="v.ii.xviii-p1"></span>But, since it is affirmed by some that,
although these are only images, yet there exist gods in honour of whom
they are made; and that the supplications and sacrifices presented to
the images are to be referred to the gods, and are in fact made to the
gods; <span id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751) and that there is not any
other way of coming to them, for

> <span id="v.ii.xviii-p2.1"></span> “’Tis hard for man  
> To meet in presence visible a God;” <span
> id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752)  

<span id="v.ii.xviii-p4"></span>and whereas, in proof that such is the
fact, they adduce the energies possessed by certain images, let us
examine into the power attached to their names. And I would beseech you,
greatest of emperors, before I enter on this discussion, to be indulgent
to me while I bring forward true considerations; for it is not my design
to show the fallacy of idols, but, by disproving the calumnies vented
against us, to offer a reason for the course of life we follow. May you,
by considering yourselves, be able to discover the heavenly kingdom
also! For as all things are subservient to you, father and son, <span
id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753) who have received the kingdom from
above (for “the king’s soul is in the hand of God,” <span
id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754) saith the prophetic Spirit), so to the
one God and the Logos proceeding from Him, the Son, apprehended by us as
inseparable from Him, all things are in like manner subjected. This then
especially I beg you carefully to consider. The gods, as they affirm,
were not from the beginning, but every one of them has come into
existence just like ourselves. And in this opinion they all agree. Homer
speaks of

> <span id="v.ii.xviii-p6.2"></span> “Old Oceanus,  
> The sire of gods, and Tethys;” <span
> id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755)  

<span id="v.ii.xviii-p8"></span>and Orpheus (who, moreover, was the
first to invent their names, and recounted their births, and narrated
the exploits of each, and is believed by them to treat with greater
truth than others of divine things, whom Homer himself follows in most
matters, especially in reference to the gods)—he, too, has fixed their
first origin to be from water:—

> <span id="v.ii.xviii-p8.1"></span> “Oceanus, the origin of all.”  

<span id="v.ii.xviii-p9"></span>For, according to him, water was the
beginning of all things, and from water mud was formed, and from both
was produced an animal, a dragon with the head of a lion growing to it,
and between the two heads there was the face of a god, named Heracles
and Kronos. This Heracles generated an egg of enormous size, which, on
becoming full, was, by the powerful friction of its generator, burst
into two, the part at the top receiving the form of heaven (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.xviii-p9.1"></span>οὐρανός</span>), and the
lower part that of earth (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.xviii-p9.2"></span>γῆ</span>). The goddess Gê moreover, came
forth with a body; and Ouranos, by his union with Gê, begat females,
Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos; and males, the hundred-handed Cottys,
Gyges, Briareus, and the Cyclopes Brontes, and Steropes, and Argos, whom
also he bound and hurled down to Tartarus, having learnt that he was to
be ejected from his government by his children; whereupon Gê, being
enraged, brought forth the Titans. <span
id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756)

> <span id="v.ii.xviii-p10.1"></span> “The godlike Gaia bore to
> Ouranos  
> Sons who are by the name of Titans known,  
> Because they vengeance <span id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757) took on
> Ouranos,  
> Majestic, glitt’ring with his starry crown.” <span
> id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758)
