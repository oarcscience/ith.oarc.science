##### <span id="vi.iv.vii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII—The Distinction Between Clean and Unclean Animals in the Law Symbolical of the Distinction Between the Church, and Jews, and Heretics.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xviii-p1"></span>After showing a little peep-hole to
those who love to contemplate the Church from the law of sacrifices
respecting clean and unclean animals (inasmuch as thus the common Jews
and the heretics are distinguished mystically from the divine Church),
let us bring the discourse to a close.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xviii-p2"></span>For such of the sacrifices as part
the hoof, and ruminate, the Scripture represents as clean and acceptable
to God; since the just obtain access to the Father and to the Son by
faith. For this is the stability of those who part the hoof, those who
study the oracles of God night and day, and ruminate them in the soul’s
receptacle for instructions; which gnostic exercise the Law expresses
under the figure of the rumination of the clean animal. But such as have
neither the one nor the other of those qualities it separates as
unclean.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xviii-p3"></span>Now those that ruminate, but do not
part the hoof, indicate the majority of the Jews, who have indeed the
oracles of God, but have not faith, and the step which, resting on the
truth, conveys to the Father by the Son. Whence also this kind of cattle
are apt to slip, not having a division in the foot, and not resting on
the twofold support of faith. For “no man,” it is said, “knoweth the
Father, but he to whom the Son shall reveal Him.” <span
id="fr_3693"></span>[3694](#fn_3693)

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xviii-p5"></span>And again, those also are likewise
unclean that part the hoof, but do not ruminate. <span
id="fr_3694"></span>[3695](#fn_3694) For these point out the heretics,
who indeed go upon the name of the Father and the Son, but are incapable
<span id="page_556">p. 556</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vii.xviii-Page_556"></span>of triturating and grinding down
the clear declaration of the oracles, and who, besides, perform the
works of righteousness coarsely and not with precision, if they perform
them at all. To such the Lord says, “Why will ye call me Lord, Lord, and
do not the things which I say?” <span
id="fr_3695"></span>[3696](#fn_3695)

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xviii-p8"></span>And those that neither part the
hoof nor chew the cud are entirely unclean.

> <span id="vi.iv.vii.xviii-p8.1"></span> “But ye Megareans,” says
> Theognis, “are neither third, nor fourth,  
> Nor twelfth, neither in reckoning nor in number,”  

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xviii-p9"></span>“but as chaff which the wind drives
away from the face of the earth,” <span
id="fr_3696"></span>[3697](#fn_3696) and as a drop from a vessel.” <span
id="fr_3697"></span>[3698](#fn_3697)

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xviii-p12"></span>These points, then, having been
formerly thoroughly treated, and the department of ethics having been
sketched summarily in a fragmentary way, as we promised; and having here
and there interspersed the dogmas which are the germs <span
id="fr_3698"></span>[3699](#fn_3698) of true knowledge, so that the
discovery of the sacred traditions may not be easy to any one of the
uninitiated, let us proceed to what we promised.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xviii-p14"></span>Now the Miscellanies are not like
parts laid out, planted in regular order for the delight of the eye, but
rather like an umbrageous and shaggy hill, planted with laurel, and ivy,
and apples, and olives, and figs; the planting being purposely a mixture
of fruit-bearing and fruitless trees, since the composition aims at
concealment, on account of those that have the daring to pilfer and
steal the ripe fruits; from which, however, the husbandmen,
transplanting shoots and plants, will adorn a beautiful park and a
delightful grove.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xviii-p15"></span>The Miscellanies, then, study
neither arrangement nor diction; since there are even cases in which the
Greeks on purpose wish that ornate diction should be absent, and
imperceptibly cast in the seed of dogmas, not according to the truth,
rendering such as may read laborious and quick at discovery. For many
and various are the baits for the various kinds of fishes.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xviii-p16"></span>And now, after this seventh
Miscellany of ours, we shall give the account of what follows in order
from another commencement. <span id="fr_3699"></span>[3700](#fn_3699)
