##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Occasion of Writing This Book.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.i-p1.1"></span>When</span> we had formerly some
conversation, my very good friend Autolycus, and when you inquired who
was my God, and for a little paid attention to my discourse, I made some
explanations to you concerning my religion; and then having bid one
another adieu, we went with much mutual friendliness each to his own
house, although at first you had borne somewhat hard upon me. For you
know and remember that you supposed our doctrine was foolishness. As you
then afterwards urged me to do, I am desirous, though not educated to
the art of speaking, of more accurately demonstrating, by means of this
tractate, the vain labour and empty worship in which you are held; and I
wish also, from a few of your own histories which you read, and perhaps
do not yet quite understand, to make the truth plain to you.
