#### <span id="ii.iii.vi-p0.1"></span>Commandment Sixth.

##### <span id="ii.iii.vi-p0.2"></span>How to Recognise the Two Spirits Attendant on Each Man, and How to Distinguish the Suggestions of the One from Those of the Other.

##### <span id="ii.iii.vi-p0.3"></span>Chap. I.

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p1"></span>“I gave you,” he said, “directions in the
first commandment to attend to faith, and fear, and self-restraint.”
“Even so, sir,” said I. And he said, “Now I wish to show you the powers
of these, that you may know what power each possesses. For their powers
are double, and have relation alike to the righteous and the
unrighteous. Trust you, therefore, the righteous, but put no trust in
the unrighteous. For the path of righteousness is straight, but that of
unrighteousness is crooked. But walk in the straight and even way, and
mind not the crooked. For the crooked path has no roads, but has many
pathless places and stumbling-blocks in it, and it is rough and thorny.
It is injurious to those who walk therein. But they who walk in the
straight road walk evenly without stumbling, because it is neither rough
nor thorny. You see, then, that it is better to walk in this road.” “I
wish to go by this road,” said I. “You will go by it,” said he; “and
whoever turns to the Lord with all his heart will walk in it.”

##### <span id="ii.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chap. II.

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p2"></span>“Hear now,” said he, “in regard to faith.
There are two angels <span id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190) with a
man—one of righteousness, and the other of iniquity.” And I said to him,
“How, sir, am I to know the powers of these, for both angels dwell with
me?” “Hear,” said he, and “understand them. The angel of righteousness
is gentle and modest, meek and peaceful. When, therefore, he ascends
into your heart, forthwith <span id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191) he
talks to you of righteousness, purity, chastity, contentment, and of
every righteous deed and glorious virtue. When all these ascend into
your heart, know that the angel of righteousness is with you. These are
the deeds of the angel of righteousness. Trust him, then, and his works.
Look now at the works of the angel of iniquity. First, he is wrathful,
and bitter, and foolish, and his works are evil, and ruin the servants
of God. When, then, he ascends into your heart, know him by his works.”
And I said to him, “How, sir, I shall perceive him, I do not know.”
“Hear and understand” said he. “When anger comes upon you, or harshness,
know that he is in you; and you will know this to be the case also, when
you are attacked by a longing after many transactions, <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192) and the richest delicacies, and
drunken revels, and divers luxuries, and things improper, and by a
hankering after women, and by overreaching, and pride, and blustering,
and by whatever is like to these. When these ascend into your heart,
know that the angel of iniquity is in you. Now that you know his works,
depart from him, and in no respect trust him, because his deeds are
evil, and unprofitable to the servants of God. These, then, are the
actions of both angels. Understand them, and trust the angel of
righteousness; but depart from the angel of iniquity, because his
instruction is bad in every deed. <span
id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193) For though a man be most
faithful, <span id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194) and the thought of
this angel ascend into his heart, that man or woman must sin. On the
other hand, be a man or woman ever so bad, yet, if the works of the
angel of righteousness ascend into his or her heart, he or she must do
something good. You see, therefore, that it is good to follow the angel
of righteousness, but to bid farewell <span
id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195) to the angel of iniquity.”

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p9"></span>“This commandment exhibits the deeds of
faith, that you may trust the works of the angel of righteousness, and
doing them you may live to God. But believe the works of the angel of
iniquity are hard. If you refuse to do them, you will live to God.”

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p3"></span> \[See [Tob.

[17](../../../bib/apo/tob003.htm#017)<span id="ii.iii.vi-p3.1"></span>.
The impure spirit, and the healing angel. This apocryphal book greatly
influenced the Church’s ideas of angels, and may have suggested this
early reference to one’s good and evil angel. The mediæval ideas on this
subject are powerfully illustrated in the German legends preserved by
Sir. W. Scott in *The Wild Huntsman* and *The Fire-King*.\]

<span id="fn_191"></span>[24:192](0020015.htm#fr_191) <span

id="ii.iii.vi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p5"></span> *Transactions*. I think the writer
means, when a longing is felt to engage with too great devotedness to
business and the pursuit of wealth. \[“That ye may attend upon the Lord
without distraction.” [1 Cor. vii.
35](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#035)<span id="ii.iii.vi-p5.1"></span>.\]

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p6"></span> *Trust … deed*. Trust the angel of
righteousness, beacause his instruction is good.—*Vat*.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[24:195](0020015.htm#fr_194) <span
id="ii.iii.vi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p7"></span> *Faithful*. Most happy.—*Vat*.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[24:196](0020015.htm#fr_195) <span
id="ii.iii.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p8"></span> *But to bid farewell.* The Vat. ends
quite differently from this point: If, then, you follow him, and trust
to his works, you will live to God; and they who trust to his works will
live to God.—*Vat*.
