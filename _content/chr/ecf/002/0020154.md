##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Accurate Information of the Christians.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xvii-p1"></span>It behoved, therefore, that he
should the rather become a scholar of God in this matter of legislation,
as he himself confessed that in no other way could he gain accurate
information than by God’s teaching him through the law. And did not the
poets Homer and Hesiod and Orpheus profess that they themselves had been
instructed by Divine Providence? Moreover, it is said that among your
writers there were prophets and prognosticators, and that those wrote
accurately who were informed by them. How much more, then, shall *we*
know the truth who are instructed by the holy prophets, who were
possessed by <span id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673) the Holy Spirit of
God! On this account all the prophets spoke harmoniously and in
agreement with one another, and foretold the things that would come to
pass in all the world. For the very accomplishment of predicted and
already consummated events should demonstrate to those who are fond of
information, yea rather, who are lovers of truth, that those things are
really true which they declared concerning the epochs and eras before
the deluge: <span id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674) to wit, how the
years have run on since the world was created until now, so as to
manifest the ridiculous mendacity of your authors, and show that their
statements are not true.
