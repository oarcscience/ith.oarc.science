##### <span id="iii.ii.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—How He Resolved to Resist the Devil.

<span id="iii.ii.xxx-p1"></span>Therefore, being initiated and
instructed in these things, I wish to put away my former errors as the
follies of childhood. For we know that the nature of wickedness is like
that of the smallest seeds; since it has waxed strong from a small
beginning, but will again be destroyed if we obey the words of God and
do not scatter ourselves. For He has become master of all we have by
means of a certain “hidden treasure,” <span
id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499) which while we are digging for we are
indeed covered with dust, but we secure it as our fixed possession. He
who receives the whole of this treasure has obtained command of the most
precious wealth. Let these things, then, be said to our friends. But to
you Greeks what can I say, except to request you not to rail at those
who are better than yourselves, nor if they are called Barbarians to
make that an occasion of banter? For, if you are willing, you will be
able to find out the cause of men’s not being able to understand one
another’s language; for to those who wish to examine our principles I
will give a simple and copious account of them.
