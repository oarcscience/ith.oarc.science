##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Their Contradictions.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.iii-p1"></span>For all these, having fallen in love
with vain and empty reputation, neither themselves knew the truth, nor
guided others to the truth: for the things which they said themselves
convict them of speaking inconsistently; and most of them demolished
their own doctrines. For not only did they refute one another, but some,
too, even stultified their own teachings; so that their reputation has
issued in shame and folly, for they are condemned by men of
understanding. For either they made assertions concerning the gods, and
afterwards taught that there was no god; or if they spoke even of the
creation of the world, they finally said that all things were produced
spontaneously. Yea, and even speaking of providence, they taught again
that the world was not ruled by providence. But what? Did they not, when
they essayed to write even of honourable conduct, teach the perpetration
of lasciviousness, and fornication, and adultery; and did they not
introduce hateful and unutterable wickedness? And they proclaim that
their gods took the lead in committing unutterable acts of <span
id="page_112">p. 112</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii.iii-Page_112"></span>adultery, and in monstrous banquets.
For who does not sing Saturn devouring his own children, and Jove his
son gulping down Metis, and preparing for the gods a horrible feast, at
which also they say that Vulcan, a lame blacksmith, did the waiting; and
how Jove not only married Juno, his own sister, but also with foul mouth
did abominable wickedness? And the rest of his deeds, as many as the
poets sing, it is likely you are acquainted with. Why need I further
recount the deeds of Neptune and Apollo, or Bacchus and Hercules, of the
bosom-loving Minerva, and the shameless Venus, since in another
place <span id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638) we have given a more
accurate account of these?
