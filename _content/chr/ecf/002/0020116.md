##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—The Creation of Man.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xviii-p1"></span>But as to what relates to the
creation of man, his own creation cannot be explained by man, though it
is a succinct account of it which holy Scripture gives. For when God
said, “Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness,” He first
intimates the dignity of man. For God having made all things by His
Word, and having reckoned them all mere bye-works, reckons the creation
of man to be the only work worthy of His own hands. Moreover, God is
found, as if needing help, to say, “Let Us make man in Our image, after
Our likeness.” But to no one else than to His own Word and wisdom did He
say, “Let Us make.” And when He had made and blessed him, that he might
increase and replenish the earth, He put all things under his dominion,
and at his service; and He appointed from the first that he should find
nutriment from the fruits of the earth, and from seeds, and herbs, and
acorns, having at the same time appointed that <span id="page_102">p.

habits similar to man’s, that they also might eat of an the seeds of the
earth.
