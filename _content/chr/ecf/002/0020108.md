##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—The World Created by God Through the Word.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p1"></span>And first, they taught us with one
consent that <span id="page_98">p. 98</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii.x-Page_98"></span>God made all things out of nothing; for
nothing was coeval with God: but He being His own place, and wanting
nothing, and existing before the ages, willed to make man by whom He
might be known; for him, therefore, He prepared the world. For he that
is created is also needy; but he that is uncreated stands in need of
nothing. God, then, having His own Word internal <span
id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565) within His own bowels, begat Him,
emitting <span id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566) Him along with His own
wisdom before all things. He had this Word as a helper in the things
that were created by Him, and by Him He made all things. He is called
“governing principle” \[<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.x-p3.4"></span>ἁρκή</span>\], because He rules, and is Lord
of all things fashioned by Him. He, then, being Spirit of God, and
governing principle, and wisdom, and power of the highest, came down
upon the prophets, and through them spoke of the creation of the world
and of all other things. For the prophets were not when the world came
into existence, but the wisdom of God which was in Him, and His holy
Word which was always present with Him. Wherefore He speaks thus by the
prophet Solomon: “When He prepared the heavens I was there, and when He
appointed the foundations of the earth I was by Him as one brought up
with Him.” <span id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567) And Moses, who lived
many years before Solomon, or, rather, the Word of God by him as by an
instrument, says, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the
earth.” First he named the “beginning,” <span
id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568) and “creation,” <span
id="fr_569"></span>[570](#fn_569) then he thus introduced God; for not
lightly and on slight occasion is it right to name God. For the divine
wisdom foreknew that some would trifle and name a multitude of gods that
do not exist. In order, therefore, that the living God might be known by
His works, and that \[it might be known that\] by His Word God created
the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, he said, “In the
beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” Then having spoken of
their creation, he explains to us: “And the earth was without form, and
void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God
moved upon the water.” This, sacred Scripture teaches at the outset, to
show that matter, from which God made and fashioned the world, was in
some manner created, being produced by God. <span

<span id="fn_565"></span>[98:566](0020108.htm#fr_565) <span
id="iv.ii.ii.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p2"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.x-p2.1"></span>ἐνδιάθτον</span>. \[Here the Logos is spoken
of in the entire spirit of the Nicene Council. [Ps. xlv.
1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001)<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p2.2"></span> is
a favourite text against Arius; and (*Advs. Judæos*. b. ii. 3) Cyprian
presses it against the Jews, which shows that they accepted the *Hebrew*
and the *LXX*. in a mystical sense.\]

<span id="fn_566"></span>[98:567](0020108.htm#fr_566) <span
id="iv.ii.ii.x-p2.3"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p3"></span> Literally, belching or vomiting. \[The
reference is to [Ps. xlv.](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#000)<span
id="iv.ii.ii.x-p3.1"></span> where the LXX. read <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p3.2"></span>ἐξηρεύξατο ἡ καρδία μου
λόγον ἀγαθὸν</span>, and the Latin <span
id="iv.ii.ii.x-p3.3"></span>*eructavit cor meum bonum Verbum*; i.e., “My
heart hath breathed forth a glorious Word.” The well-chosen language of
the translator (emitted) is degraded by his note.\]

<span id="fn_567"></span>[98:568](0020108.htm#fr_567) <span
id="iv.ii.ii.x-p3.5"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p4"></span> [Prov. viii.
27](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#027)<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p4.1"></span>.
Theophilus reads with the Septuagint, “I was with Him, putting things
into order,” instead of “I was by Him as one brought up with Him.”
\[Here the Logos is the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.x-p4.2"></span>σοφία</span> as with the Fathers generally;
e.g. Cyprian, *Advs. Judæos*, book ii. 2. But see cap. xv. p. 101,
*infra*.\]

<span id="fn_568"></span>[98:569](0020108.htm#fr_568) <span
id="iv.ii.ii.x-p4.3"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p5"></span> That is, the first principle, whom he
has just shown to be the Word.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[98:570](0020108.htm#fr_569) <span
id="iv.ii.ii.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p6"></span> In the Greek version of [Gen. i.
1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001)<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p6.1"></span>,
the word “created” stands before “God.”

<span id="fn_570"></span>[98:571](0020108.htm#fr_570) <span
id="iv.ii.ii.x-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p7"></span> Theophilus, therefore, understands that
when in the first verse it is said that God created the earth, it is
meant that he created the matter of which the earth is formed.
