##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Gods are Despised When They are Made; But Become Valuable When Bought.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.ii-p1"></span>And in truth it does seem to me absurd
that statuaries and carvers, or painters, or moulders, should both
design and paint, and carve, and mould, and prepare gods, who, when they
are produced by the artificers, are reckoned of no value; but as soon as
they are purchased <span id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548) by some and
placed in some so-called temple, or in some house, not only do those who
bought them sacrifice to them, but also those who made and sold them
come with much devotion, and apparatus of sacrifice, and libations, to
worship them; and they reckon them gods, not seeing that they are just
such as when they were made by themselves, whether stone, or brass, or
wood, or colour, or some other material. And this is your case, too,
when you read the histories and genealogies of the so-called gods. For
when you read of their births, you think of them as men, but afterwards
you call them gods, and worship them, not reflecting nor understanding
that, when born, they are exactly such beings as ye read of before.
