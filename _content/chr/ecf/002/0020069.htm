<p><a name="iii.ii.xxxiii-p1"></A>Therefore I have been desirous to prove from the things which are esteemed honourable among you, that our institutions are marked by sober-mindedness, but that yours are in close affinity with madness.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">504</FONT></A>
 You who say that we talk nonsense among women and boys, among maidens and old women, and scoff at us for not being with you, hear what silliness prevails among the Greeks. For their works of art are devoted to worthless objects, while they are held in higher estimation by you than even your gods; and you behave yourselves unbecomingly in what relates to woman. For Lysippus cast a statue of Praxilla, whose poems contain nothing useful, and Menestratus one of Learchis, and Selanion one of Sappho the courtezan, and Naucydes one of Erinna the Lesbian, and Boiscus one of Myrtis, and Cephisodotus one of Myro of Byzantium, and Gomphus one of Praxigoris, and Amphistratus one of Clito. And what shall I say about Anyta, Telesilla, and Mystis? Of the first Euthycrates and Cephisodotus made a statue, and of the second Niceratus, and of the third Aristodotus; Euthycrates made one of Mnesiarchis the Ephesian, Selanion one of Corinna, and Euthycrates one of Thalarchis the Argive. My object in referring to these women is, that you may not regard as something strange what  <A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.xxxiii-Page_79"></A>you find among us, and that, comparing the statues which are before your eyes, you may not treat the women with scorn who among us pursue philosophy. This Sappho is a lewd, love-sick female, and sings her own wantonness;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_504"><FONT SIZE="1">505</FONT></A>
 but all our women are chaste, and the maidens at their distaffs sing of divine things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_505"></A><A HREF="#fn_505"><FONT SIZE="1">506</FONT></A>
 more nobly than that damsel of yours. Wherefore be ashamed, you who are professed disciples of women yet scoff at those of the sex who hold our doctrine, as well as at the solemn assemblies they frequent.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_506"></A><A HREF="#fn_506"><FONT SIZE="1">507</FONT></A>
 What a noble infant did Glaucipp&eacute; present to you, who brought forth a prodigy, as is shown by her statue cast by Niceratus, the son of Euctemon the Athenian! But, if Glaucipp&eacute; brought forth an elephant, was that a reason why she should enjoy public honours? Praxiteles and Herodotus made for you Phryn&eacute; the courtezan, and Euthycrates cast a brazen statue of Panteuchis, who was pregnant by a whoremonger; and Dinomenes, because Besantis queen of the P&aelig;onians gave birth to a black infant, took pains to preserve her memory by his art. I condemn Pythagoras too, who made a figure of Europa on the bull; and you also, who honour the accuser of Zeus on account of his artistic skill. And I ridicule the skill of Myron, who made a heifer and upon it a Victory because by carrying off the daughter of Agenor it had borne away the prize for adultery and lewdness. The Olynthian Herodotus made statues of Glycera the courtezan and Argeia the harper. Bryaxis made a statue of Pasipha&euml;; and, by having a memorial of her lewdness, it seems to have been almost your desire that the women of the present time should be like her.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_507"></A><A HREF="#fn_507"><FONT SIZE="1">508</FONT></A>
 A certain Melanipp&euml; was a wise woman, and for that reason Lysistratus made her statue. But, forsooth, you will not believe that among us there are wise women!</p>

The growing asceticism and fanatical views of sexual relations, which were now rising in the Church, were a morbid but virtuous revolt of faith against these impurities.]</p>
