<p> <a name="vi.iii.ii.viii"></A> <h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p0.1"></A>Chapter VIII.&#8212;On the Use of Ointments and Crowns.</h5>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p1"></A>The use of crowns and ointments is not necessary for us; for it impels to pleasures and indulgences, especially on the approach of night. I know that the woman brought to the sacred supper &#8220;an alabaster box of ointment,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1452"></A><A HREF="#fn_1452"><FONT SIZE="1">1453</FONT></A>
 and anointed the feet of the Lord, and refreshed Him; and I know that the ancient kings of the Hebrews were crowned with gold and precious stones. But the woman not having yet received the Word (for she was still a sinner), honoured the Lord with what she thought the most precious thing in her possession&#8212;the ointment; and with the ornament of her person, with her hair, she wiped off the superfluous ointment, while she expended on the Lord tears of repentance: &#8220;wherefore her sins are forgiven.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1453"></A><A HREF="#fn_1453"><FONT SIZE="1">1454</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p4"></A>This may be a symbol of the Lord&#146;s teaching, and of His suffering. For the feet anointed with fragrant ointment mean divine instruction travelling with renown to the ends of the earth.  &#8220;For their sound hath gone forth to the ends of the earth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1454"></A><A HREF="#fn_1454"><FONT SIZE="1">1455</FONT></A>
 And if I seem not to insist too much, the feet of the Lord which were anointed are the apostles, having, according to prophecy, received the fragrant unction of the Holy Ghost. Those, therefore, who travelled over the world and preached the Gospel, are figuratively called the feet of the Lord, of whom also the Holy Spirit foretells in the psalm, &#8220;Let us adore at the place where His feet stood,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1455"></A><A HREF="#fn_1455"><FONT SIZE="1">1456</FONT></A>
 that is, where the apostles, His feet, arrived; since, preached by them, He came to the ends of the earth. And tears are repentance; and the loosened hair proclaimed deliverance from the love of finery, and the affliction in patience which, on account of the Lord, attends preaching, the old vainglory being done away with by reason of the new faith.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1456"></A><A HREF="#fn_1456"><FONT SIZE="1">1457</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p8"></A>Besides, it shows the Lord&#146;s passion, if you understand it mystically thus: the oil (<span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p8.1"></A>&#7956;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>) is the Lord Himself, from whom comes the mercy (<span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p8.2"></A>&#7956;&#955;&#949;&#959;&#962;</span>) which reaches us. But the ointment,  <A NAME="page_254"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 254</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-Page_254"></A>which is adulterated oil, is the traitor Judas, by whom the Lord was anointed on the feet, being released from His sojourn in the world. For the dead are anointed. And the tears are we repentant sinners, who have believed in Him, and to whom He has forgiven our sins. And the dishevelled hair is mourning Jerusalem, the deserted, for whom the prophetic lamentations were uttered. The Lord Himself shall teach us that Judas the deceitful is meant: &#8220;He that dippeth with Me in the dish, the same shall betray Me.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1457"></A><A HREF="#fn_1457"><FONT SIZE="1">1458</FONT></A>
 You see the treacherous guest, and this same Judas betrayed the Master with a kiss. For he was a hypocrite, giving a treacherous kiss, in imitation of another hypocrite of old. And He reproves that people respecting whom it was said, &#8220;This people honour Me with their lips; but their heart is far from Me.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1458"></A><A HREF="#fn_1458"><FONT SIZE="1">1459</FONT></A>
 It is not improbable, therefore, that by the oil He means that disciple to whom was shown mercy, and by the tainted and poisoned oil the traitor.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p11"></A>This was, then, what the anointed feet prophesied&#8212;the treason of Judas, when the Lord went to His passion. And the Saviour Himself washing the feet of the disciples,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1459"></A><A HREF="#fn_1459"><FONT SIZE="1">1460</FONT></A>
 and despatching them to do good deeds, pointed out their pilgrimage for the benefit of the nations, making them beforehand fair and pure by His power. Then the ointment breathed on them its fragrance, and the work of sweet savour reaching to all was proclaimed; for the passion of the Lord has filled us with sweet fragrance, and the Hebrews with guilt. This the apostle most clearly showed, when he said, &#8220;thanks be to God, who always makes us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of His knowledge by us in every place. For we are to God a sweet savour of the Lord, in them that are saved, and them that are lost; to one a savour of death unto death, to the other a savour of life unto life.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1460"></A><A HREF="#fn_1460"><FONT SIZE="1">1461</FONT></A>
 And the kings of the Jews using gold and precious stones and a variegated crown, the anointed ones wearing Christ symbolically on the head, were unconsciously adorned with the head of the Lord. The precious stone, or pearl, or emerald, points out the Word Himself. The gold, again, is the incorruptible Word, who admits not the poison of corruption. The Magi, accordingly, brought to Him on His birth, gold, the symbol of royalty. And this crown, after the image of the Lord, fades not as a flower.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p14"></A>I know, too, the words of Aristippus the Cyrenian. Aristippus was a luxurious man. He asked an answer to a sophistical proposition in the following terms: &#8220;A horse anointed with ointment is not injured in his excellence as a horse, nor is a dog which has been anointed, in his excellence as a dog; no more is a man,&#8221; he added, and so finished. But the dog and horse take no account of the ointment, whilst in the case of those whose perceptions are more rational, applying girlish scents to their persons, its use is more censurable. Of these ointments there are endless varieties, such as the Brenthian, the Metallian, and the royal; the Plangonian and the Psagdian of Egypt. Simonides is not ashamed in Iambic lines to say,&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p14.1"></A> &#8220;I was anointed with ointments and perfumes,<br>  And with nard.&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>  
<p class="continue"><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p15"></A>For a merchant was present. They use, too, the unguent made from lilies, and that from the cypress. Nard is in high estimation with them, and the ointment prepared from roses and the others which women use besides, both moist and dry, scents for rubbing and for fumigating; for day by day their thoughts are directed to the gratification of insatiable desire, to the exhaustless variety of fragrance. Wherefore also they are redolent of an excessive luxuriousness. And they fumigate and sprinkle their clothes, their bed-clothes, and their houses. Luxury all but compels vessels for the meanest uses to smell of perfume.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p16"></A>There are some who, annoyed at the attention bestowed on this, appear to me to be rightly so averse to perfumes on account of their rendering manhood effeminate, as to banish their compounders and vendors from well-regulated states, and banish, too, the dyers of flower-coloured wools. For it is not right that ensnaring garments and unguents should be admitted into the city of truth; but it is highly requisite for the men who belong to us to give forth the odour not of ointments, but of nobleness and goodness. And let woman breathe the odour of the true royal ointment, that of Christ, not of unguents and scented powders; and let her always be anointed with the ambrosial chrism of modesty, and find delight in the holy unguent, the Spirit. This ointment of pleasant fragrance Christ prepares for His disciples, compounding the ointment of celestial aromatic ingredients.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p17"></A>Wherefore also the Lord Himself is anointed with an ointment, as is mentioned by David: &#8220;Wherefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows; myrrh, and stacte, and cassia from thy garments.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1461"></A><A HREF="#fn_1461"><FONT SIZE="1">1462</FONT></A>
 But let us not unconsciously abominate unguents, like vultures or like beetles (for these, they say, when smeared with ointment, die); and let a few unguents be selected by women, such as will not be overpowering to a husband. For excessive anointings with unguents savour of a funeral  <A NAME="page_255"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 255</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-Page_255"></A>and not of connubial life. Yet oil itself is inimical to bees and insects; and some men it benefits, and some it summons to the fight; and those who were formerly friends, when anointed with it, it turns out to deadly combat.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p19"></A>Ointment being smooth oil, do you not think that it is calculated to render noble manners effeminate? Certainly. And as we have abandoned luxury in taste, so certainly do we renounce voluptuousness in sights and odours; lest through the senses, as through unwatched doors, we unconsciously give access into the soul to that excess which we have driven away. If, then, we say that the Lord the great High Priest offers to God the incense of sweet fragrance, let us not imagine that this is a sacrifice and sweet fragrance of incense;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1462"></A><A HREF="#fn_1462"><FONT SIZE="1">1463</FONT></A>
 but let us understand it to mean, that the Lord lays the acceptable offering of love, the spiritual fragrance, on the altar.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p21"></A>To resume: oil itself suffices to lubricate the skin, and relax the nerves, and remove any heavy smell from the body, if we require oil for this purpose. But attention to sweet scents is a bait which draws us in to sensual lust. For the licentious man is led on every hand, both by his food, his bed, his conversation, by his eyes, his ears, his jaws, and by his nostrils too. As oxen are pulled by rings and ropes, so is the voluptuary by fumigations and unguents, and the sweet scents of crowns. But since we assign no place to pleasure which is linked to no use serviceable to life, come let us also distinguish here too, selecting what is useful. For there are sweet scents which neither make the head heavy nor provoke love, and are not redolent of embraces and licentious companionship, but, along with moderation, are salutary, nourishing the brain when labouring under indisposition, and strengthening the stomach. One must not therefore refrigerate himself with flowers when he wishes to supple his nerves.  For their use is not wholly to be laid aside, but ointment is to be employed as a medicine and help in order to bring up the strength when enfeebled, and against catarrhs, and colds, and ennui, as the comic poet says:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p21.1"></A> &#8220;The nostrils are anointed; it being<br>  A most essential thing for health to fill the brain with good odours.&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>  
<p class="continue"><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p22"></A>The rubbing of the feet also with the fatness of warming or cooling unguents is practiced on account of its beneficial effects; so consequently, in the case of those who are thus saturated, an attraction and flow take place from the head to the inferior members.  But pleasure to which no utility attaches, induces the suspicion of meretricious habits, and is a drug provocative of the passions. Rubbing one&#146;s self with ointment is entirely different from anointing one&#146;s self with ointment. The former is effeminate, while anointing with ointment is in some cases beneficial. Aristippus the philosopher, accordingly, when anointed with ointment, said &#8220;that the wretched Cin&#339;di deserved to perish miserably for bringing the utility of ointment into bad repute.&#8221; &#8220;Honour the physician for his usefulness,&#8221; says the Scripture, &#8220;for the Most High made him; and the art of healing is of the Lord.&#8221; Then he adds, &#8220;And the compounder of unguents will make the mixture,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1463"></A><A HREF="#fn_1463"><FONT SIZE="1">1464</FONT></A>
 since unguents have been given manifestly for use, not for voluptuousness. For we are by no means to care for the exciting properties of unguents, but to choose what is useful in them, since God hath permitted the production of oil for the mitigation of men&#146;s pains.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p24"></A>And silly women, who dye their grey hair and anoint their locks, grow speedily greyer by the perfumes they use, which are of a drying nature. Wherefore also those that anoint themselves become drier, and the dryness makes them greyer. For if greyness is an exsiccation of the hair, or defect of heat, the dryness drinking up the moisture which is the natural nutriment of the hair, and making it grey, how can we any longer retain a liking for unguents, through which ladies, in trying to escape grey hair, become grey? And as dogs with fine sense of smell track the wild beasts by the scent, so also the temperate scent the licentious by the superfluous perfume of unguents.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p25"></A>Such a use of crowns, also, has degenerated to scenes of revelry and intoxication. Do not encircle my head with a crown, for in the springtime it is delightful to while away the time on the dewy meads, while soft and many-coloured flowers are in bloom, and, like the bees, enjoy a natural and pure fragrance.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1464"></A><A HREF="#fn_1464"><FONT SIZE="1">1465</FONT></A>
 But to adorn one&#146;s self with &#8220;a crown woven from the fresh mead,&#8221; and wear it at home, were unfit for a man of temperance. For it is not suitable to fill the wanton hair with rose-leaves, or violets, or lilies, or other such flowers, stripping the sward of its flowers. For a crown encircling the head cools the hair, both on account of its moisture and its coolness. Accordingly, physicians, determining by physiology that the brain is cold, approve of anointing the breast and the points of the nostrils, so that the warm exhalation passing gently through, may salutarily warm the chill. A man ought not therefore to cool himself with flowers. Besides, those who crown themselves destroy the pleasure there is in flowers: for they enjoy neither the sight of them, since they wear the crown  <A NAME="page_256"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 256</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-Page_256"></A>above their eyes; nor their fragrance, since they put the flowers away above the organs of respiration. For the fragrance ascending and exhaling naturally, the organ of respiration is left destitute of enjoyment, the fragrance being carried away. As beauty, so also the flower delights when looked at; and it is meet to glorify the Creator by the enjoyment of the sight of beautiful objects.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1465"></A><A HREF="#fn_1465"><FONT SIZE="1">1466</FONT></A>
 The use of them is injurious, and passes swiftly away, avenged by remorse. Very soon their evanescence is proved; for both fade, both the flower and beauty. Further, whoever touches them is cooled by the former, inflamed by the latter. In one word, the enjoyment of them except by sight is a crime, and not luxury. It becomes us who truly follow the Scripture to enjoy ourselves temperately, as in Paradise. We must regard the woman&#146;s crown to be her husband, and the husband&#146;s crown to be marriage; and the flowers of marriage the children of both, which the divine husbandman plucks from meadows of flesh. &#8220;Children&#146;s children are the crown of old men.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1466"></A><A HREF="#fn_1466"><FONT SIZE="1">1467</FONT></A>
 And the glory of children is their fathers, it is said; and our glory is the Father of all; and the crown of the whole church is Christ. As roots and plants, so also have flowers their individual properties, some beneficial, some injurious, some also dangerous. The ivy is cooling; nux emits a stupefying effluvium, as the etymology shows. The narcissus is a flower with a heavy odour; the name evinces this, and it induces a torpor (<span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p28.2"></A>&#957;&#8049;&#961;&#954;&#951;&#957;</span>) in the nerves. And the effluvia of roses and violets being mildly cool, relieve and prevent headaches. But we who are not only not permitted to drink with others to intoxication, but not even to indulge in much wine,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1467"></A><A HREF="#fn_1467"><FONT SIZE="1">1468</FONT></A>
 do not need the crocus or the flower of the cypress to lead us to an easy sleep. Many of them also, by their odours, warm the brain, which is naturally cold, volatilizing the effusions of the head. The rose is hence said to have received its name (<span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p29.1"></A>&#8165;&#8057;&#948;&#959;&#957;</span>) because it emits a copious stream (<span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p29.2"></A>&#8165;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;</span>) of odour (<span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p29.3"></A>&#8000;&#948;&#969;&#948;&#8053;</span>). Wherefore also it quickly fades.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p30"></A>But the use of crowns did not exist at all among the ancient Greeks; for neither the suitors nor the luxurious Ph&aelig;acians used them. But at the games there was at first the gift to the athletes; second, the rising up to applaud; third, the strewing with leaves; lastly, the crown, Greece after the Median war having given herself up to luxury.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p31"></A>Those, then, who are trained by the Word are restrained from the use of crowns; and do not think that this Word, which has its seat in the brain, ought to be bound about, not because the crown is the symbol of the recklessness of revelry, but because it has been dedicated to idols. Sophocles accordingly called the narcissus &#8220;the ancient coronet of the great gods,&#8221; speaking of the earth-born divinities; and Sappho crowns the Muses with the rose:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p31.1"></A> &#8220;For thou dost not share in roses from Pieria.&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>  
<p class="skip"><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p32"></A>They say, too, that Here delights in the lily, and Artemis in the myrtle. For if the flowers were made especially for man, and senseless people have taken them not for their own proper and grateful use, but have abused them to the thankless service of demons, we must keep from them for conscience sake. The crown is the symbol of untroubled tranquillity. For this reason they crown the dead, and idols, too, on the same account, by this fact giving testimony to their being dead. For revellers do not without crowns celebrate their orgies; and when once they are encircled with flowers, at last they are inflamed excessively. We must have no communion with demons. Nor must we crown the living image of God after the manner of dead idols. For the fair crown of amaranth is laid up for those who have lived well. This flower the earth is not able to bear; heaven alone is competent to produce it.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1468"></A><A HREF="#fn_1468"><FONT SIZE="1">1469</FONT></A>
 Further, it were irrational in us, who have heard that the Lord was crowned with thorns,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1469"></A><A HREF="#fn_1469"><FONT SIZE="1">1470</FONT></A>
 to crown ourselves with flowers, insulting thus the sacred passion of the Lord. For the Lord&#146;s crown prophetically pointed to us, who once were barren, but are placed around Him through the Church of which He is the Head.  But it is also a type of faith, of life in respect of the substance of the wood, of joy in respect of the appellation of crown, of danger in respect of the thorn, for there is no approaching to the Word without blood. But this platted crown fades, and the plait of perversity is untied, and the flower withers. For the glory of those who have not believed on the Lord fades. And they crowned Jesus raised aloft, testifying to their own ignorance. For being hard of heart, they understood not that this very thing, which they called the disgrace of the Lord, was a prophecy wisely uttered: &#8220;The Lord was not known by the people&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1470"></A><A HREF="#fn_1470"><FONT SIZE="1">1471</FONT></A>
 which erred, which was not circumcised in understanding, whose darkness was not enlightened, which knew not God, denied the Lord, forfeited the place of the true Israel, persecuted God, hoped to reduce the Word to disgrace; and Him whom they crucified as a malefactor they crowned as a king. Wherefore the Man on whom they believed not, they shall  <A NAME="page_257"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 257</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-Page_257"></A>know to be the loving God the Lord, the Just. Whom they provoked to show Himself to be the Lord, to Him when lifted up they bore witness, by encircling Him, who is exalted above every name, with the diadem of righteousness by the ever-blooming thorn. This diadem, being hostile to those who plot against Him, coerces them; and friendly to those who form the Church, defends them. This crown is the flower of those who have believed on the glorified One, but covers with blood and chastises those who have not believed. It is a symbol, too, of the Lord&#146;s successful work, He having borne on His head, the princely part of His body, all our iniquities by which we were pierced. For He by His own passion rescued us from offences, and sins, and such like thorns; and having destroyed the devil, deservedly said in triumph, &#8220;O Death, where is thy sting?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1471"></A><A HREF="#fn_1471"><FONT SIZE="1">1472</FONT></A>
 And we eat grapes from thorns, and figs from thistles; while those to whom He stretched forth His hands&#8212;the disobedient and unfruitful people&#8212;He lacerates into wounds. I can also show you another mystic meaning in it.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1472"></A><A HREF="#fn_1472"><FONT SIZE="1">1473</FONT></A>
 For when the Almighty Lord of the universe began to legislate by the Word, and wished His power to be manifested to Moses, a godlike vision of light that had assumed a shape was shown him in the burning bush (the bush is a thorny plant); but when the Word ended the giving of the law and His stay with men, the Lord was again mystically crowned with thorn. On His departure from this world to the place whence He came, He repeated the beginning of His old descent, in order that the Word beheld at first in the bush, and afterwards taken up crowned by the thorn, might show the whole to be the work of one power, He Himself being one, the Son of the Father, who is truly one, the beginning and the end of time.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p39"></A>But I have made a digression from the p&aelig;dagogic style of speech, and introduced the didactic.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1473"></A><A HREF="#fn_1473"><FONT SIZE="1">1474</FONT></A>
 I return accordingly to my subject.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii.viii-p41"></A>To resume, then: we have showed that in the department of medicine, for healing, and sometimes also for moderate recreation, the delight derived from flowers, and the benefit derived from unguents and perfumes, are not to be overlooked. And if some say, What pleasure, then, is there in flowers to those that do not use them? let them know, then, that unguents are prepared from them, and are most useful. The Susinian ointment is made from various kinds of lilies; and it is warming, aperient, drawing, moistening, abstergent, subtle, antibilious, emollient. The Narcissinian is made from the narcissus, and is equally beneficial with the Susinian. The Myrsinian, made of myrtle and myrtle berries, is a styptic, stopping effusions from the body; and that from roses is refrigerating. For, in a word, these also were created for our use. &#8220;Hear me,&#8221; it is said, &#8220;and grow as a rose planted by the streams of waters, and give forth a sweet fragrance like frankincense, and bless the Lord for His works.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1474"></A><A HREF="#fn_1474"><FONT SIZE="1">1475</FONT></A>
 We should have much to say respecting them, were we to speak of flowers and odours as made for necessary purposes, and not for the excesses of luxury. And if a concession must be made, it is enough for people to enjoy the fragrance of flowers; but let them not crown themselves with them. For the Father takes great care of man, and gives to him alone His own art. The Scripture therefore says, &#8220;Water, and fire, and iron, and milk, and fine flour of wheat, and honey, the blood of the grape, and oil, and clothing,&#8212;all these things are for the good of the godly.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1475"></A><A HREF="#fn_1475"><FONT SIZE="1">1476</FONT></A>
