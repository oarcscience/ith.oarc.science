##### <span id="vi.ii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—The True Doctrine is to Be Sought in the Prophets.

<span id="vi.ii.viii-p1"></span>It is now time, as we have despatched in
order the other points, to go to the prophetic Scriptures; for the
oracles present us with the appliances necessary for the attainment of
piety, <span id="page_194">p. 194</span> <span
id="vi.ii.viii-Page_194"></span>and so establish the truth. The divine
Scriptures and institutions of wisdom form the short road to salvation.
Devoid of embellishment, of outward beauty of diction, of wordiness and
seductiveness, they raise up humanity strangled by wickedness, teaching
men to despise the casualties of life; and with one and the same voice
remedying many evils, they at once dissuade us from pernicious deceit,
and clearly exhort us to the attainment of the salvation set before us.
Let the Sibyl <span id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929) prophetess, then,
be the first to sing to us the song of salvation:—

> <span id="vi.ii.viii-p2.1"></span> “So He is all sure and unerring:  
> Come, follow no longer darkness and gloom;  
> See, the sun’s sweet-glancing light shines gloriously.  
> Know, and lay up wisdom in your hearts:  
> There is one God, who sends rains, and winds, and earthquakes,  
> Thunderbolts, famines, plagues, and dismal sorrows,  
> And snows and ice. But why detail particulars?  
> He reigns over heaven, He rules earth,  
> He truly is;”—  

<span id="vi.ii.viii-p3"></span>where, in remarkable accordance with
inspiration <span id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930) she compares
delusion to darkness, and the knowledge of God to the sun and light, and
subjecting both to comparison, shows the choice we ought to make. For
falsehood is not dissipated by the bare presentation of the truth, but
by the practical improvement of the truth it is ejected and put to
flight.

<span id="vi.ii.viii-p5"></span>Jeremiah the prophet, gifted with
consummate wisdom, <span id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931) or rather the
Holy Spirit in Jeremiah, exhibits God. “Am I a God at hand,” he says,
“and not a God afar off? Shall a man do ought in secret, and I not see
him? Do I not fill heaven and earth? Saith the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.ii.viii-p6.1"></span>Lord</span>.” <span
id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932)

<span id="vi.ii.viii-p8"></span>And again by Isaiah, “Who shall measure
heaven with a span, and the whole earth with his hand?” <span
id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933) Behold God’s greatness, and be filled
with amazement. Let us worship Him of whom the prophet says, “Before Thy
face the hills shall melt, as wax melteth before the fire!” <span
id="fr_934"></span>[935](#fn_934) This, says he, is the God “whose
throne is heaven, and His footstool the earth; and if He open heaven,
quaking will seize thee.” <span id="fr_935"></span>[936](#fn_935) Will
you hear, too, what this prophet says of idols? “And they shall be made
a spectacle of in the face of the sun, and their carcases shall be meat
for the fowls of heaven and the wild beasts of the earth; and they shall
putrefy before the sun and the moon, which they have loved and served;
and their city shall be burned down.” <span
id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936) He says, too, that the elements and
the world shall be destroyed. “The earth,” he says, “shall grow old, and
the heaven shall pass away; but the word of the Lord endureth for ever.”
What, then, when again God wishes to show Himself by Moses: “Behold ye,
behold ye, that <span class="sc"><span id="vi.ii.viii-p12.2"></span>I
Am</span>, and there is no other God beside Me. I will kill, and I will
make to live; I will strike, and I will heal; and there is none who
shall deliver out of My hands.” <span id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937)
But do you wish to hear another seer? You have the whole prophetic
choir, the associates of Moses. What the Holy Spirit says by Hosea, I
will not shrink from quoting: “Lo, I am He that appointeth the thunder,
and createth spirit; and His hands have established the host of
heaven.” <span id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938) And once more by
Isaiah. And this utterance I will repeat: “I am,” he says, “I am the
<span class="sc"><span id="vi.ii.viii-p14.2"></span>Lord</span>; I who
speak righteousness, announce truth. Gather yourselves together, and
come. Take counsel together, ye that are saved from the nations. They
have not known, they who set up the block of wood, their carved work,
and pray to gods who will not save them.” <span
id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939) Then proceeding: “I am God, and there
is not beside Me a just God, and a Saviour: there is none except Me.
Turn to Me, and ye will be saved, ye that are from the end of the earth.
I am God, and there is no other; by Myself I swear.” <span
id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940) But against the worshippers of idols
he is exasperated, saying, “To whom will ye liken the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.ii.viii-p16.2"></span>Lord</span>, or to what
likeness will ye compare Him? Has not the artificer made the image, or
the goldsmith melted the gold and plated it with gold?” <span
id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941) —and so on. Be not therefore
idolaters, but even now beware of the threatenings; “for the graven
images and the works of men’s hands shall wail, or rather they that
trust in them,” <span id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942) for matter is
devoid of sensation. Once more he says, “The <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.ii.viii-p18.2"></span>Lord</span> will shake the cities that are
inhabited, and grasp the world in His hand like a nest.” <span
id="fr_943"></span>[944](#fn_943) Why repeat to you the mysteries of
wisdom, and sayings from the writings of the son of the Hebrews, the
master of wisdom? “The <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.ii.viii-p19.2"></span>Lord</span> created me the beginning of His
ways, in order to His works.” <span id="fr_944"></span>[945](#fn_944)
And, “The <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.ii.viii-p20.2"></span>Lord</span> giveth wisdom, and from His
face proceed knowledge and understanding.” <span
id="fr_945"></span>[946](#fn_945) “How long wilt thou lie in bed, O
sluggard; and when wilt thou be aroused from sleep?” <span
id="fr_946"></span>[947](#fn_946) “but if thou show thyself no <span
id="page_195">p. 195</span> <span
id="vi.ii.viii-Page_195"></span>sluggard, as a fountain thy harvest
shall come,” <span id="fr_947"></span>[948](#fn_947) the “Word of the
Father, the benign light, the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.ii.viii-p23.2"></span>Lord</span> that bringeth light, faith to
all, and salvation.” <span id="fr_948"></span>[949](#fn_948) For “the
<span class="sc"><span id="vi.ii.viii-p24.2"></span>Lord</span> who
created the earth by His power,” as Jeremiah says, “has raised up the
world by His wisdom;” <span id="fr_949"></span>[950](#fn_949) for
wisdom, which is His word, raises us up to the truth, who have fallen
prostrate before idols, and is itself the first resurrection from our
fall. Whence Moses, the man of God, dissuading from all idolatry,
beautifully exclaims, “Hear, O Israel, the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.ii.viii-p25.2"></span>Lord</span> thy God is one <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.ii.viii-p25.3"></span>Lord</span>; and thou
shall worship the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.ii.viii-p25.4"></span>Lord</span> thy God, and Him only shall
thou serve.” <span id="fr_950"></span>[951](#fn_950) “Now therefore be
wise, O men,” according to that blessed psalmist David; “lay hold on
instruction, lest the Lord be angry, and ye perish from the way of
righteousness, when His wrath has quickly kindled. Blessed are all they
who put their trust in Him.” <span id="fr_951"></span>[952](#fn_951) But
already the Lord, in His surpassing pity, has inspired the song of
salvation, sounding like a battle march, “Sons of men, how long will ye
be slow of heart? Why do you love vanity, and seek after a lie?” <span
id="fr_952"></span>[953](#fn_952) What, then, is the vanity, and what
the lie? The holy apostle of the Lord, reprehending the Greeks, will
show thee: “Because that, when they knew God, they glorified Him not as
God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and
changed the glory of God into the likeness of corruptible man, and
worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator.” <span
id="fr_953"></span>[954](#fn_953) And verily this is the God who “in the
beginning made the heaven and the earth.” <span
id="fr_954"></span>[955](#fn_954) But you do not know God, and worship
the heaven, and how shall you escape the guilt of impiety? Hear again
the prophet speaking: “The sun, shall suffer eclipse, and the heaven be
darkened; but the Almighty shall shine for ever: while the powers of the
heavens shall be shaken, and the heavens stretched out and drawn
together shall be rolled as a parchment-skin (for these are the
prophetic expressions), and the earth shall flee away from before the
face of the Lord.” <span id="fr_955"></span>[956](#fn_955)
