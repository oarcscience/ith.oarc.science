##  Introductory Note to the Instructions of Commodianus.

\[a.d.; 240.\] Our author seems to have been a North-African bishop, of
whom little is known save what we learn from his own writings. He has
been supposed to incline to some ideas of Praxeas, and also to the
Millenarians, but perhaps on insufficient grounds. His Millenarianism
reflects the views of a very primitive age, and that without the corrupt
Chiliasm of a later period, which brought about a practical repudiation
of the whole system.<sup>[1](footnote/fn58.htm#P5805_945393)</sup> Of
his writings, two poems only remain, and of these the second, a very
recent discovery, has no place in the Edinburgh series. I greatly regret
that it cannot be included in ours.As a poetical work the following
prose version probably does it no injustice. His versification is
pronounced very crabbed, and his diction is the wretched patois of North
Africa. But the piety and earnestness of a practical Christian seem
everywhere conspicuous in this fragment of antiquity.
