<span id="P4914_768062"></span> <sup>258</sup> C*ae*lataque sancta. We
might conjecture "c*e*lataque sancta," = "and the sanctuaries formerly
hidden."

<span id="P4921_768423"></span> <sup>259</sup> This sense appears
intelligible, as the writer's aim seems to be to distinguish between the
"actual" commands of God, i.e., the spiritual, essential ones, which the
spiritual people "follow," and which "bind" - not the ceremonial
observance of a "shadow of the future blessings" (see Heb. x. 1), but
"real persons," i.e., living souls. But, as Migne has said, the passage
is probably faulty and mutilated.

<span id="P4923_768886"></span> <sup>260</sup> Comp. Heb. vii. 19, x. 1,
xi. 11, 12.

<span id="P4926_769023"></span> <sup>261</sup> "Lignum:" here probably =
"the flesh," which He took from Mary; the "rod" (according to our
author) which Isaiah had foretold.

<span id="P4928_769188"></span> <sup>262</sup> AÃ«rial, i.e., as he said
above, "dyed with *heaven's hue*."

<span id="P4930_769310"></span> <sup>263</sup> "Ligno," i.e., "the
cross," represented by the "wood" of which the tabernacle's boards, on
which the coverings were stretched (but comp. 147-8, above), were made.

<span id="P4932_769527"></span> <sup>264</sup> As the flame of the lamps
appeared to grow out of and be fused with the "golden semblance" or
"form" of the lampstand or candlestick.

<span id="P4935_769734"></span> <sup>265</sup> Of which the olive - of
which the pure oil for the lamps was to be made: Ex. xxvii. 20; Lev.
xxiv. 2 - is a type. "Peace" is granted to "the flesh" through Christ's
work and death in flesh.

<span id="P4941_770177"></span> <sup>266</sup> Traditus.

<span id="P4955_770731"></span> <sup>267</sup> In ligno. The passage is
again in an almost desperate state.

<span id="P4960_770964"></span> <sup>268</sup> Isa. xi. 1, 2.

<span id="P4968_771251"></span> <sup>269</sup> Matt. v. 23, 24.

<span id="P4973_771440"></span> <sup>271</sup> See Rev. viii. 3, 4.

<span id="P4974_771481"></span> <sup>272</sup> Here ensues a confused
medley of all the cherubic figures of Moses, Ezekiel, and St. John.

<span id="P4977_771668"></span> <sup>273</sup> i.e., by the four
evangelists.

<span id="P4982_771859"></span> <sup>274</sup> The cherubim, (or,
"seraphim" rather,) of Isa. vi. have each *six* wings. Ezekiel mentions
*four* cherubim, or "living creatures." St. John likewise mentions
*four* "living creatures." Our author, combining the passages, and
thrusting them into the subject of the Mosaic cherubim, multiplies the
*six* (wings) by the *four* (cherubs), and so attains his end - the
desired number "*twenty-four*" - to represent the books of the Old
Testament, which (by combining certain books) may be reckoned to be
*twenty-four* in number.

<span id="P4985_772480"></span> <sup>275</sup> These wings.

<span id="P4997_772961"></span> <sup>276</sup> There is again some great
confusion in the text. The elders could not "*stand enthroned*:" nor do
they stand "*over*," but "*around*" God's throne; so that the "insuper
solio" could not apply to that.
