<span id="P4218_729738"></span> <sup>129</sup> Speculo vultus. The two
words seem to me to go together, and, unless the second be indeed
redundant, to mean perhaps a small *hand-mirror*, which affords more
facilities for minute examination of the face than a larger fixed one.

<span id="P4222_730052"></span> <sup>130</sup> "Sortis;" lit. "lot,"
here = "the line or family chosen *by lot*." Compare the similar
derivation of "clergy."

<span id="P4238_730821"></span> <sup>131</sup> Lignum.

<span id="P4241_730922"></span> <sup>132</sup> I have ventured to
substitute "Christ*o*" for "Christ*i*;" and thus, for

"Cum Christ*i* populo manifeste multa locutus,"read,

"Cum Christo (populo manifeste) multa locutus."The reference is to the
fact, on which such special stress is laid, of the Lord's "speaking to
Moses *face to face, as a man speaketh with his friend*." See especially
Num. xii. 5-8, Deut. xxxiv. 9-12, with Deut. xviii. 17-19, Acts iii. 22,
23, vii. 37.

<span id="P4245_731469"></span> <sup>133</sup> The Latin in Oehler and
Migne is thus:

"Accepram legem per paucos fudit in orbem;"and the reference seems to me
to be to Ex. xxxii. 15-20, though the use of "orbem" for "ground" is
perhaps strange; but "humum" would have been against the metre, if that
argument be of any weight in the case of a writer so prolific of false
quantities. Possibly the lines may mean that "he diffused through some
few" - i.e., through the Jews, "few" as compared with the total
inhabitants of the orb - "the Law which he had received;" but then the
following line seems rather to favour the former view, because the
tables of the Law - called briefly "the Law" - broken by Moses so soon
after he had received them, were typical of the inefficacy of all Moses'
own toils, which, after all, ended in disappointment, as he was
forbidden, on account of a sin committed in the very last of the forty
years, to lead the people into "the land," as 'he had fondly hoped to
do. Only I suspect some error in "per paucos;" unless it be lawful to
supply "dies," and take it to mean "received during but few days," i.e.,
"*within* few days," "only a few days before," and "accepted" or "kept"
by the People "during but a few days." Would it be lawful to conjecture
"perpau*cis*" as one word, with "ante diebus" to be understood?

<span id="P4249_732913"></span> <sup>134</sup> i.e., the sign of the
cross. See Tertullian, *adv. Marc.*, l. iii. c. xviii. *sub. fin*.; also
*adv. Jud*., c. x. *med*.

<span id="P4251_733088"></span> <sup>135</sup> i.e., all the acts and
the experiences of Moses.

<span id="P4254_733204"></span> <sup>136</sup> Moses.

<span id="P4258_733359"></span> <sup>137</sup> See Ex. xxiii. 20-23; and

<span id="P4266_733711"></span> <sup>138</sup> Legitima, i.e., reverent
of law.

<span id="P4270_733891"></span> <sup>139</sup> i.e., virtuous acts.

<span id="P4280_734224"></span> <sup>140</sup> Or, "valour."

<span id="P4281_734263"></span> <sup>141</sup> The Latin runs thus:

Non virtute sua trtelam acquirere genti."I have ventured to read
"su*ae*," and connect it with "genti;" and thus have obtained what seems
to me a probable sense. See Judg. viii. 22, 23.

<span id="P4283_734522"></span> <sup>142</sup> I read "firm*andus*" for
"firm*atus*."

<span id="P4291_734855"></span> <sup>144</sup> I have again ventured a
correction, "coa*r*escere" for "coa*l*escere." It makes at least *some*
sense out of an otherwise (to *me*) unintelligible passage, the "palm"
being taken as the well-known symbol of bloom and triumph. So David in
Ps. xcii. 12 (xci. 13 in LXX.), "The righteous shall *flourish* like the
*palm-tree*." To "dry" here is, of course, neuter, and means to
"wither."

<span id="P4295_735350"></span> <sup>145</sup> I have changed "e*a*dem"
- which must agree with "nocte," and hance give a false sense; for it
was not, of course, on "*the same night*," but on the next, that his
second sign was given - into "e*o*dem," to agree with "liquore," which
gives a true one, as the "moisture," of course, *was* the same, - dew,
namely.

<span id="P4299_735814"></span> <sup>146</sup> Equite. It appears to be
used loosely for "men of war" generally.
