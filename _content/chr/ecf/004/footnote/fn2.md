<span id="P201_31446"></span> <sup>49</sup> Or, "which are now
attributed to Novius." Novius was a writer of that kind of farce called
"Atellanae favulae;" and one of his farces - or one attributed to him in
Tertullian's day - was called "The Fullers."

Oehler).

<span id="P210_34054"></span> <sup>56</sup> I have adopted Oehler's
suggestion, and inserted these words.

<span id="P211_34258"></span> <sup>57</sup> i.e., of Cloacina or
Cluacina (= "the Purifier," a name of Venue; comp. White and Riddle),
which Tertullian either purposely connects with "cloaca," a sewer (with
which, indeed, it may be *really* connected, as coming derivatively from
the same root), and takes to mean "the nymphs of the sewers" apparently.

<span id="P212_34678"></span> <sup>58</sup> The nymphs above named
(Oehler).

<span id="P213_37793"></span> <sup>59</sup> i.e., are worn by his

<span id="P219_39185"></span> <sup>62</sup> Or, "forcipes."

<span id="P220_40204"></span> <sup>63</sup> Of course the meaning is,
"on the doffing of which a man congratulates himself more," etc.; but
Tertullian as it were personifies the act of doffing, and represents it
as congratulating the doffer; and I have scrupulously retained all his
extravagances, believing them (in the present treatise at least) to be
intentional.

"involving superhuman effort."

<span id="P223_41385"></span> <sup>66</sup> Oehler attempts to defend
the common reading, "humerum *velans* exponit vel includit;" but the
correction of Salmasius and Lud. de la Cerda which he quotes, "*vel
exponit*," is followed in preference. If Oehler's reading be retained,
we may render: "a covering for the shoulder, it exposes or encloses it
at will."

<span id="P224_42134"></span> <sup>67</sup> i.e., the "shoeing"
appropriate to the *mantle* will consist at most of *sandals;* "*shoes*"
being (as has been said) suited to the *gown*.

<span id="P225_43186"></span> <sup>68</sup> "Erat." - Oehler, who refers
to "errat" as the general reading, and (if adopted) renders: "This
sentiment errs (Or wanders) in all directions;" making *olim* =
*passim.*
