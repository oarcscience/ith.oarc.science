<SUP>188 </SUP>This is the way Oehler's punctuation reads. Migne's reads as follows: -</P>

    <UL><UL><P> ... "Of whom the first</P>

    <P>Whom mightiest Rome bade take his place and sit</P>

</UL></UL><P>Upon the chair where Peter's self had sat," etc.</P>

<P><A NAME="P4607_750775"></A>
<SUP>189 </SUP>"Is spostolicis bene notus." This may mean (<I>a</I>) as in our text; (<I>b</I>) by his apostolically-minded writings - writings like an apostle's; or (<I>c</I>) by the apostolic writings, i.e., by the mention made of him, supposing him to be the same, in Phil. iv. 3.</P>

<SUP>194 </SUP>Our author makes the name Anicetus. Rig. (as quoted by Oehler) observes that a comparison of the list of bishops of Rome here given with that given by Tertullian in <I>de Praescr</I>., c. xxxii., seems to show that this metrical piece cannot be his.</P>

<SUP>195 </SUP>The state of the text in some parts of this book is frightful. It has been almost hopeless to extract any sense whatever out of the Latin in many passages - indeed, the renderings are in these cases little better than guess-work - and the confusion of images, ideas, and quotations is extraordinary.</P>

<P><A NAME="P4656_753319"></A>

<SUP>198 </SUP>Molem belli deducere terrae.</P>

<P><A NAME="P4682_754637"></A>

<SUP>207 </SUP>These lines are capable, according to their punctuation, of various renderings, which for brevity's sake I must be content to omit.</P>
