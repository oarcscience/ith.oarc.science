Full many sighs may furnish anxious food."

<span id="P2714_652531"></span> <sup>35</sup> The writer makes
"cherubim" - or "cherubin" - singular. I have therefore retained his
mistake. What the "hot point" - "calidus apex" - is, is not clear. It
may be an allusion the "flaming sword" (see Gen. iii. 24); or it may
mean the top of the flame.

correct, the words *gelida* and *incanduit* seem to be intentionally
contrasted, unless *incandescere* be used here in a supposed sense of
"growing white," "turning pale." *Urere* is used in Latin of heat and
cold indifferently. Calida would, of course, be a ready emendation; but
*gelida* has the advantage of being far more startling.

bear in mind, in reading this piece, tedious in its elaborate struggles
after effect, that the constant repetitions of words and expressions
with which his patience will be tried, are due to the original. It was
irksome to reproduce them; but fidelity is a translator's first law.
