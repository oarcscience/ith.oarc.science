<SUP>89 </SUP>Viro. This use of "<I>man</I>" may be justified, to say nothing of other arguments, from Jer. xliv. 19, where "<I>our men</I>" seem plainly = "our husbands." See marg.</P>

<SUP>90 </SUP>Virgo: a play on the word in connection with the "viro" and what follows.</P>

<SUP>92 </SUP>i.e., Adam's. The constructions, as will be seen, are oddly confused throughout, and I rather suspect some transposition of lines.</P>

<SUP>101 </SUP>This would seem to refer to Lazarus; but it seems to be an assumption that his raising took place on a Sabbath.</P>

<SUP>106 </SUP>I read "prim<I>um</I>" here for "prim<I>us</I>."</P>
