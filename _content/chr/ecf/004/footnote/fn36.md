and the temple there.

<span id="P3610_697852"></span> <sup>31</sup> Mundi.

<span id="P3633_698751"></span> <sup>32</sup> Oehler's "versus" (=
"changed the man rises") is set aside for Migne's "verus." Indeed it is
probably a misprint.

<span id="P3636_698963"></span> <sup>33</sup> i.e., her own dwelling or
"quarters," - the body, to wit, if the reading "sua parte" be correct.

<span id="P3649_699553"></span> <sup>34</sup> Egestas.

<span id="P3650_699577"></span> <sup>35</sup> Eget.

<span id="P3662_700011"></span> <sup>36</sup> I have ventured to alter
the "*e*t viven*ti*" of Oehler and Migne into "*u*t viven*di*," which
seems to improve the sense.

<span id="P3669_700401"></span> <sup>37</sup> It seems to me that these
ideas should all be expressed interrogatively, and I have therefore so
expressed them in my text.

Whether the meaning be that, as the *soul* will be able (as it should
seem) to retrace all that she has experienced since she left the body,
so the *body*, when revived, will be able as it were to look back upon
all that has happened to her since the soul left her, - something after
the manner in which Hamlet traces the imaginary vicissitudes of Caesar's
dust, - or whether there be some great error in the Latin, I leave the
reader to judge.

<span id="P3689_701780"></span> <sup>40</sup> i.e., apparently
remembering that she *was* so *before*.

<span id="P3691_701877"></span> <sup>41</sup> Vivida virtus.

<span id="P3695_702001"></span> <sup>42</sup> I rather incline to read
for "haec captiva fuit mortis," "haec cartiva fuat mortis" =

To be death's thrall?'""This" is, of course, the flesh.
