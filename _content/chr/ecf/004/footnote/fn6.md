<span id="P627_149189"></span> <sup>37</sup> So Oehler and others. But
one ms. reads "concupiscentiae fructum" for "concupiscentiam fructus;"
which would make the sense somewhat plainer, and hence is perhaps less
likely to be the genuine reading.

<span id="P639_154843"></span> <sup>42</sup> Oehler's "*immutare*"

"on account of the angels" of c. xi.

<span id="P646_156557"></span> <sup>46</sup> i.e., for the sake of *the
brethren*, who (after all) are *men*, as the *heathens* are (Oehler,
after Rig.).

<span id="P655_160215"></span> <sup>52</sup> So Oehler, with Rig., seems
to understand "publicato bono suo." But it may be doubted whether the
use of the singular "bono," and the sense in which "publicare" and
"bonum" have previously occurred in this treatise, do not warrant the
rendering, "and elated by the public announcement of their good deed" -
in self-devotion. Comp. "omnis publicatio virginis bonae" in c. iii.,
and similar phrases. Perhaps the two meanings may be intentionally
implied.

<span id="P656_161321"></span> <sup>53</sup> Matt. x. 26. Again
apparently a double meaning, in the word "*revelabitus*" = "unveiled,"
which (of course) is the strict sense of "*re*vealed," i.e.,
"re-veiled."
