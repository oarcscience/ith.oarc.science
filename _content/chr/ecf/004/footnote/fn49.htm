<P><A NAME="P4921_768423"></A>
<SUP>259 </SUP>This sense appears intelligible, as the writer's aim seems to be to distinguish between the "actual" commands of God, i.e., the spiritual, essential ones, which the spiritual people "follow," and which "bind" - not the ceremonial observance of a "shadow of the future blessings" (see Heb. x. 1), but "real persons," i.e., living souls. But, as Migne has said, the passage is probably faulty and mutilated.</P>

<SUP>272 </SUP>Here ensues a confused medley of all the cherubic figures of Moses, Ezekiel, and St. John.</P>

<P><A NAME="P4982_771859"></A>
<SUP>274 </SUP>The cherubim, (or, "seraphim" rather,) of Isa. vi. have each <I>six</I> wings. Ezekiel mentions <I>four</I> cherubim, or "living creatures." St. John likewise mentions <I>four</I> "living creatures." Our author, combining the passages, and thrusting them into the subject of the Mosaic cherubim, multiplies the <I>six</I> (wings) by the <I>four</I> (cherubs), and so attains his end - the desired number "<I>twenty-four</I>" - to represent the books of the Old Testament, which (by combining certain books) may be reckoned to be <I>twenty-four</I> in number.</P>

<P><A NAME="P4985_772480"></A>
<SUP>275 </SUP>These wings.</P>

<P><A NAME="P4997_772961"></A>
<SUP>276 </SUP>There is again some great confusion in the text. The elders could not "<I>stand enthroned</I>:" nor do they stand "<I>over</I>," but "<I>around</I>" God's throne; so that the "insuper solio" could not apply to that.</P>
