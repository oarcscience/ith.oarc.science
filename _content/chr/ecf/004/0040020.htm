<p><a></a> I</p>  
<p>The Shepherd of Hermas, p. 85.</p>  
<p>Here, and in chap. xx. below, Tertullian's rabid utterances against the <i>Shepherd</i> may be balanced by what he had said, less unreasonably, in his better mood.<sup><a href="footnote/fn16.htm#P1681_495591">299</a></sup> Now he refers to the <i>Shepherd's</i> (ii. 1)<sup><a href="footnote/fn16.htm#P1682_495714">300</a></sup> view of pardon, even to adulterers. But surely it might be objected even more plausibly against "the Shepherd," whom he prefers, in common with all Christians, as see John 8:1-11, which I take to be canonical Scripture. A curious question is suggested by what he says of the figure of the Good Shepherd portrayed on the chalice: Is this <i>irony</i>, as if the figure so familiar from illustrations of the catacombs must be meant for the <i>Shepherd</i> of Hermas? Regarding all pictures as idolatrous, he may intend to intimate that adultery (=idolatry) was thus symbolized.</p>  
<p><a></a> II</p>  
<p>Clasping the knees of all, p. 86.</p>  
<p>Here is a portrait of the early penitential discipline sufficiently terrible, and it conforms to the apostolic pictures of the same. "Tell it unto the Church," says our Lord (Matt. xviii. 17). In 1 Cor. v. 4 the apostle ("present in spirit") gives judgment, but the whole Church is "gathered together." In James 5:16 the "confession to one another" seems to refer to this public discipline, as also the prayer for healing enjoined on <i>one another</i>. St. Chrysostom, however, reflecting the discipline of his day, in which great changes were made, says, on Matthew 18:17, unless it be a gloss, "Dic Ecclesuoeid est Proesidibus = prooeligddreuou/sin." (Tom. vii. p. 536, ed. Migne.)</p>  
<p><a></a> III'</p>  
<p>Remedial discipline, p. 87.</p>  
<p>Powerfully as Tertullian states his view of this apostolic "delivering unto Satan" as for final perdition, it is not to be gainsaid that (1 Corinthians 5:5) the object was salvation and hope, "that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus." Thus, the power of Satan to inflict bodily suffering (Job 2:6), when divinely permitted, is recognised under the Gospel (Luke 13:16; 2 Corinthians 12:7). The remedial mercy of trials and sufferings may be inferred when providentially occurring.</p>  
<p><a></a> IV</p>  
<p>Personally upon Peter, p. 99.</p>  
<p>See what has been said before. But note our author (now writing against the Church, and as a Montanist) has no idea that the <i>personal</i> prerogative of St. Peter had descended to any bishop. More when we come to Cyprian, and see vol. iii. p. 630, this series. </p>
