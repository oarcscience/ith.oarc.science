<p>Albeit they be laics, p. 54.</p>  
<p>In the tract on <i>Baptism</i><sup><a href="footnote/fn10.htm#P1065_271082">70</a></sup> Tertullian uses language implying that three persons compose a Church. But here we find it much more strongly pronounced,-Ubi tres, Ecclesia est, licet Laici. The question of lay-baptism we may leave till we come to Cyprian, only noting here, that, while Cyprian abjures his "master" on this point, his adversary, the Bishop of Rome, adopts Tertullian's principle in so far. But, in view of Matthew 19:20, surely we may all allow that three are a quorum when so "gathered together in Christ's name," albeit not for all purposes. Three women may claim the Saviour's promise when lawfully met together for social devotions, nor can it be denied that they have a share in the priesthood of the "peculiar people." So, too, even of three pious children. But it does not follow that they are a church <i>for all purposes</i>,-preaching, celebrating sacraments, ordaining, and the like. The late Dean Stanley was fond of this passage of Tertullian, but obviously it might be abused to encourage a state of things which all orderly and organized systems of religion must necessarily discard.<sup><a href="footnote/fn10.htm#P1066_272205">71</a></sup> On p. 58 there is a reference, apparently, to <i>deaconesses</i> as "women in Ecclesiastical Orders." </p>
