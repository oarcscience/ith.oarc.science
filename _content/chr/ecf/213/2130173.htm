<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii.ii.ix-p2"></A>The specimens of Ephraim&#146;s compositions offered in these selections are:&#8212;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii.ix-p3"></A>(1) The <i>Nisibene Hymns</i>, (2) The <i>Hymns of the Nativity</i>, (3) The <i>Hymns for the Epiphany</i>, (4) Three <i>Homilies</i> (i., <i>On our Lord</i>; ii., <i>On Reproof and Repentance</i>; iii., <i>On the Sinful Woman</i>).</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii.ix-p4"></A>Of (2) the <i>Nativity</i> Hymns, the first thirteen are reprinted from the version by the Rex. J. B. Morris (Oxford, 1847), made from the Roman Edition of the Syriac <i>Works of Ephraim</i>.&#160; The rest of the series as translated (six&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_311"></A><A HREF="#fn_311"><FONT SIZE="1">312</FONT></A>
 in number, making nineteen in all) were unknown when that edition was completed in 1743.&#160; These latter, and also (3) the <i>Epiphany</i> Hymns (with one exception)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_312"></A><A HREF="#fn_312"><FONT SIZE="1">313</FONT></A>
 have since come to light in the Nitrian collection of the British Museum, and were printed by Professor Lamy in his <i>St. Ephraim</i> <A NAME="page_151"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 151</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iii.ii.ix-Page_151"></A> (Tom. I, cc. 1&#8211;144; Tom. II., cc. 427&#8211;504), 1882&#8211;1889.&#160; In the same edition (Tom. I., cc. 145&#8211;274; 311&#8211;338) were first printed (4) the three Homilies.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_313"></A><A HREF="#fn_313"><FONT SIZE="1">314</FONT></A>
&#160; Our translations of these follow Lamy&#146;s text, with here and there a slight variation where errors seem to exist.&#160; These two series of Hymns belong to the ecclesiastical class:&#160; their titles appropriate them to two great Festivals of the Church, and portions of these are embodied in Syriac Rituals still in use.&#160; Of the two Homilies, the former was written for the Feast of the Epiphany, like the Hymns which precede it.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii.ix-p8"></A>The <i>Nisibene Hymns</i> (1) are translated from the text as first printed by Dr. Bickell (1866), whose edition, like that of Dr. Lamy, rests upon <span class="sc"><a name="iii.iii.ii.ix-p8.1"></A>mss.</span> of the Nitrian collection.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_314"></A><A HREF="#fn_314"><FONT SIZE="1">315</FONT></A>
&#160; They also were unknown to the Roman editors of the last century, and to the English translator of 1847; and they have not till now appeared in English.&#160; The series when complete consisted of 77 Hymns.&#160; Of these the first division (I.&#8211;XXXIV.) treat of the fortunes of the Church in Nisibis, Carrhena [Haran], and an unnamed city (probably Edessa).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_315"></A><A HREF="#fn_315"><FONT SIZE="1">316</FONT></A>
&#160; The remainder (XXXV. to end) deal with the topics of Death and the Resurrection.&#160; The present selection comprises 46 of these, namely:&#8212;of the <i>first</i> division, the first 21, those which relate to Nisibis and which are the <i>Nisibene Hymns</i> proper; of the <i>second</i> division, two series&#8212;one of 8 hymns (XXXV.&#8211;XLII.) in which Death and Satan hold monologue or dialogue,&#8212;the other of 17 (LII.&#8211;LXVIII.), similar in character, but with Man as a third interlocutor.</p>
