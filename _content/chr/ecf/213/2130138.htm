<p class="c18"><a name="ii.ix.viii-p2"></A><i>To Paschasius, Bishop of Neapolis (Naples</i>).</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="ii.ix.viii-p3"></A>Gregory to Paschasius, &amp;c.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ix.viii-p4"></A>Those who with pure intent desire to bring to the true faith aliens from the Christian religion should study kindness, and not asperity; lest such as reason rendered with smoothness might have appealed to should be driven far off by opposition.&#160; For whosoever act otherwise, and under cover of such intention would suspend people from their accustomed observance of their own rites, are proved to be intent on their own cause rather than on God&#146;s.&#160; To wit, the Jews dwelling in Naples have complained to us, asserting that certain persons are endeavouring unreasonably to drive them from certain solemnities of their holidays, so that it may not be lawful for them to observe the solemnities of their festivals, as up to this time since long ago <A NAME="page_97"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 97</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ix.viii-Page_97"></A>it has been lawful for them and their forefathers to keep and observe them.&#160; Now, if this is true, these people appear to be taking trouble to no purpose.&#160; For what is the use, when even such long unaccustomed prohibition is of no avail for their faith and conversion?&#160; Or why should we lay down rules for the Jews as to how they should observe their ceremonies, if we cannot thereby win them?&#160; We should therefore so act that, being rather appealed to by reason and kindness they may wish to follow us, and not to fly from us; and that proving to them from their own Scriptures what we tell them, we may be able, with God&#146;s help, to convert them to the bosom of Mother Church.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ix.viii-p5"></A>Wherefore let thy Fraternity, so far as may be possible, with the help of God, kindle them to conversion, and not allow them any more to be disquieted with respect to their solemnities; but let them have free licence to observe and celebrate all their festivals and holidays, even as hitherto both they and their forefathers for a long time back have kept and held them.</p>
