<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xlvii-p2"></A>1. Come ye, let us hear how Death convicts the People:&#160; that harsher than Death was their sword, against the just.&#8212;2. <i>R., To Thee be glory, Who by Thy sacrifice, hast redeemed our disgrace:&#160; and Whose death was instead of all deaths, that Thou mightst raise all!</i>&#8212;3. It was not Death indeed that crucified Jesus, but <i>it was</i> the People:&#160; how hateful then the People, that are yet more hateful than I!&#8212;4. Into the pit they cast Jeremiah, the miry <i>pit</i>:&#160; but I in Sheol allotted, honour to his bones.&#8212;5. Naboth they bruised <i>to death</i> with stones, as though <i>he were</i> a dog:&#160; how good am I who have never stoned, even a dog!&#8212;6. The Hebrew women in famine, ate their children:&#160; Sheol <i>is</i> good who delivers and gives them up, without difficulty.&#8212;7. To the widow I gave her son, by the hand of Elijah:&#160; to the Shunamite her beloved, by the hand of Elisha.&#8212;8. The Hebrew women in greed, ate their children:&#160; Sheol gave up the dead and learned, to fast soberly.&#8212;9. Sheol was not indeed Sheol, but <i>its</i> semblance:&#160; Jezebel was the true Sheol, who devoured the just.&#8212;10. The sons of the prophets and the prophets, she slew and cast down:&#160; to heaven Elijah escaped, from her fury.&#8212;11. How many deaths instead of one Death, were among the People! and how many Sheols instead of one, were there also!&#8212;12. Samaria and Jezrael her daughters, in Israel:&#160; and Zion and Jerusalem her sister, in Judea.&#8212;13. Prophets and just men in Judea, and in Israel:&#160; in these two abysses, they were drowned.&#8212;14. Why then is Sheol hated, and she alone:&#160; though there be many that are hateful, rather than she?&#8212;15. The dead of the men of Judah, to me are right hateful:&#160; yea, abhorred by me are their bones, in the midst of Sheol.&#8212;16. Would that then I had a way to cast them out:&#160; <i>to cast</i> their bones thence from Sheol, for they cause her to rot.&#8212;17. I wonder at the Holy Spirit, that He thus dwelt:&#160; in the midst of a People whose savour stank, as their conversation.&#8212;18. Onions and garlic <i>are</i> the heralds of their doings:&#160; as is the food so is the understanding, of this defiled people.&#8212;19. Through the supplication of all that bow, and worship Thy Father:&#160; have mercy on Thy worshipper, who is thankless for Thy love.&#8212;20. From Hebrews and Aram&aelig;ans, and also from the Watchers:&#160; to Thee <i>be</i> praise and through Thee to Thy Father, be also glory!&#8212;21. For that I have a mouth to Death, who is without mouth:&#160; may the Son Who is all mouths, hold back my offence from His Father!</p>
