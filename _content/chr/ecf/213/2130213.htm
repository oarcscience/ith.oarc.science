<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xxxvii-p2"></A>1. Listen, my brethren, to Death, mocking the Evil One:&#160; that caused the head of our race to sin, and its mother.&#8212;2. <i>R., To Thee be glory that by Thy humiliation, Satan is subdued:&#160; and that Thy abasement has exalted Adam, who was abased.</i>&#8212;3. <i>D</i>., Thy great nakedness shall be seen, by the sons of Adam; as thou mockedst his nakedness, when thou madest him sin.&#8212;4. Eve will cease from that serpent, and rail at thee:&#160; for thou, O Dragon, wast he that beguiled her simpleness.&#8212;5. Abel will see him, even, Cain, who has come to thee:&#160; the disciple of his wrath will blame his cursed master.&#8212;6. <i>S</i>., Noah who conquered the flood, as it were death:&#160; by the mouth of Ham I laughed at, when wine overcame him.&#8212;7. <i>D</i>., Noah was not harmed, but thy garment, wherewith thou clothedst him:&#160; even cursings, he put on, and became a slave.&#8212;8. <i>S</i>., Lot who overcame anger which is, thy likeness, Death:&#160; to his daughters I gave such counsels, as were pleasing to me.&#8212;9. <i>D</i>., And Lot&#146;s wife who was thy vessel hearkened, to thy counsel:&#160; may half of thee be dried up, as thy whole vessel was dried up!&#8212;10. Gehenna be overturned, upon thy head:&#160; as thy malice overturned Sodom, its dwellers!&#8212;11. Floods of fire be stirred against thee, in the resurrection:&#160; who against Moses and Elijah, didst stir the people!&#8212;12. Let the just mock thee at the last, and Joseph rejoice! whose brethren mocked him, set on by thee!&#8212;13. Let vapour of smoke come in, and choke thy senses:&#160; as the waters of the sea choked, the senses of the wicked! &#8212;14. Let chaste women also mock thee, by whose counsel:&#160; the daughters of Midian <A NAME="page_211"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 211</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.xxxvii-Page_211"></A>mocked, the foolish people!&#8212;15. Flame be kindled on thy head, for Samson&#146;s sake:&#160; for by a woman thou shavedst his locks, that lion of strength!&#8212;16. <i>S</i>., Saul whom I conquered by envy, by witchcraft conquered thee:&#160; for he asked for and brought up Samuel, out of his grave.&#8212;17. <i>D</i>., Slander not the living dead, for he came not up:&#160; thou wast he that came up in the phantom for thou wast worthy.&#8212;18. Let the commandment hang thee over the flame, thou Evil One! for by thee they hanged Absalom, upon a tree.&#8212;19. In the fire mayst thou see thyself humbled, among vile women! for Solomon by thee was degraded, among profane women.&#8212;20. Justice be measured to thee, as thou didst inflame her! even Jezebel who devoured the prophets, thou kindledst her.&#8212;21. In fire mayst thou justly burn, who madest them drunken! the two whom Elijah burnt up, when they went up and assailed <i>him</i>.&#8212;22. On thee also be coals heaped! may he see and rejoice:&#160; that Naboth in whom thou heapedst, a pile of stones!&#8212;23. Be thou clad in scorn in the day of judgment, before all beholders! who clothedst Gehasi in a leprosy, by means of thy theft.&#8212;24. With lightning for a dart be thou pierced, O Satan! who in the heart of Josiah, didst fix <i>thy</i> darts.&#8212;25. Sink thou in the dregs of Gehenna, O Satan! who didst sink Jeremiah in the mire of the pit.&#8212;26. Daniel escaped from the pit, whither thou didst cast him:&#160; may he have comfort in seeing thee, in the furnace for ever!&#8212;27. Be thy wickedness returned on thy head, Hater of man:&#160; as his wickedness was returned on the head, of Haman thy fellow! &#8212;28. May the King&#146;s Bride mock thee, as did Esther:&#160; when thou beseechest her in the judgment-day, to plead for thee!&#8212;29. Fire released the righteous ones, whom thou hadst bound:&#160; a mighty bond be to thee, the flame of fire!&#8212;30. Be thou torn in sunder, and may the seven brothers, see thy defeat:&#160; the sons of Shemuni who by thy wolves, were torn in sunder!&#8212;31. May fire triumph over thy pate, as thou didst mock:&#160; the two heads of Nazarites, sons of the barren!&#8212;32. May fire make mock of thy head, for mother and daughter:&#160; triumphed over John&#146;s head, when thou didst madden them!&#8212;33. Flame triumphed over thy head, O Evil One:&#160; for on the charges thou didst triumph, over John&#146;s head!</p>
