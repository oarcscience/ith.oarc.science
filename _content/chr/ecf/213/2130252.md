<span id="iii.vi.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>Hymn V.</span>

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p2"></span>(<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.vi.vi-p2.1"></span>Resp</span>.—*Blessed be He that ordained
baptism, for the atonement of the sons of Adam!*)

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p3"></span>1.  Descend, my brethren, put on from the
waters of baptism the Holy Spirit;—be joined with the spirits that
minister to the Godhead!

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p4"></span>2.  For lo! He is the fire that secretly,
seals also His flock,—by the Three spiritual Names, wherein the Evil One
is put to flight.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p5"></span>3.  John when he cried and said “This is
the Lamb of God,”—thereby showed concerning the Gentiles that they are
Abraham’s children.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p6"></span>4.  This is he that testified of our
Saviour, that with fire and the Spirit He should baptize.—Lo! the fire
and the Spirit, my brethren, in the baptism of truth.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p7"></span>5.  For greater is Baptism than Jordan
that little river;—for that in streams of water and oil, the misdeeds of
all men are washed out.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p8"></span>6.  Elisha by seven times *washing*,
cleansed Naaman’s leprosy:—in Baptism are cleansed the secret misdeeds
in the soul.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p9"></span>7.  Moses baptized the People in the
midst of the sea, yet availed not—to wash their heart within, that was
full of the defilements of misdeeds.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p10"></span><span id="page_273">p. 273</span> <span
id="iii.vi.vi-Page_273"></span>8.  Lo! the priest in the likeness of
Moses purges the defilements of the soul;—and with oil of anointing, lo!
he seals new lambs for the Kingdom.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p11"></span>9.  Samuel anointed David to be king
among the People:—but lo! the priest anoints you to be heirs in the
Kingdom.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p12"></span>10.  For with the armour that David put
on, after the anointing he fought—and laid low the giant who sought to
subdue Israel.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p13"></span>11.  Lo! again in the chrism of Christ,
and in the armour that is from the water—the haughtiness of the Evil One
is humbled, who sought to subdue the Gentiles.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p14"></span>12.  By the water that flowed from the
rock, the thirst of the People was quenched.  Lo! in the fountain of
Christ, the thirst of the peoples is quenched.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p15"></span>13.  The rod of Moses opened the rock,
and the streams flowed forth; and they were refreshed by its draught,
who had grown faint with thirst.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p16"></span>14.  Lo! from the side of Christ flowed
the stream that bestowed life.—The Gentiles drank that were weary, and
in it forgot their pains.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p17"></span>15.  With Thy dew besprinkle my
vileness, and my crimes in Thy blood shall be atoned!—And I shall be, O
my Lord, at Thy right hand, and with Thy Saints I shall be joined!
