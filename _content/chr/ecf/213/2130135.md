id="ii.ix.v-p1.1"></span>Epistle VIII.</span>

<span id="ii.ix.v-p2"></span>To Senator, Abbot.

<span id="ii.ix.v-p3"></span>Gregory to Senator, presbyter and abbot of
a hospital (or guest-house, *xenodochii*).

<span id="ii.ix.v-p5"></span>\[See the epistle following (Ep. ix.<span
id="ii.ix.v-p5.1"></span>), with which this agrees throughout, as does
also Epistle X. to Lupo, except for the different designations of the
persons addressed and places referred to, and the addition in epistles
VIII. and IX., after the words “or absolve her (*him*) as innocent,” of
the following paragraph.\]

<span id="ii.ix.v-p6"></span>By a similar definition, according to the
desire of the founders, we decree that none of those who may in future
have been ordained as abbot or presbyter to the same guest-house and
monastery shall dare by any secret scheming whatever to take the office
of the Episcopate, unless he has been first deprived of the office of
abbot, and another has been substituted in his place; lest, by consuming
the property of the guest-house or monastery in unfair expenditure, he
should cause most serious pressure of want to the poor and strangers, or
to others who live from its resources.  Moreover, we forbid that the
bishop have licence, without the consent of the abbot and presbyter, to
remove from the same place any monk for promotion to an ecclesiastical
order, or for any cause whatever, lest usurpation in this regard should
be carried to such an extent that places which have to be built up by
the acquisition of men be destroyed by their removal.
