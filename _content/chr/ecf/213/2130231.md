<span id="iii.v.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.v.vi-p1.1"></span>Hymn V.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi-p2.1"></span>At</span> the birth of the Son, there was a
great shouting in Bethlehem; for the Angels came down, and gave praise
there.  Their voices were a great thunder:  at that voice of praise the
silent ones came, and gave praise to the Son.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p3"></span>Blessed be that Babe in whom Eve and Adam
were restored to youth!  The shepherds also came laden with the best
gifts of their flock:  sweet milk, clean flesh, befitting praise!  They
put a difference, and gave Joseph the flesh, Mary the milk, and the Son
the praise!  They brought and presented a suckling lamb to the Paschal
Lamb, a first-born to the First-born, a sacrifice to the Sacrifice, a
lamb of time to the Lamb of Truth.  Fair sight \[to see\] the lamb
offered to The Lamb!

<span id="iii.v.vi-p4"></span>The lamb bleated as it was offered before
the First-born.  It praised the Lamb, that had come to set free the
flocks and the oxen from sacrifices: <span
id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448)   yea that Paschal Lamb, Who handed
down and brought in the Passover of the Son.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p6"></span>The shepherds came near and worshipped Him
with their staves.  They saluted Him with peace, prophesying the while,
“Peace, O Prince of the Shepherds.”  The rod of Moses <span
id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449) praised Thy Rod, O Shepherd of all;
for Thee Moses praises, although his lambs have become wolves, and his
flocks as it were dragons, and his sheep fanged beasts.  In the fearful
wilderness his flocks became furious, and attacked him.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p8"></span><span id="page_238">p. 238</span> <span
id="iii.v.vi-Page_238"></span>Thee then the Shepherds praise, because
Thou hast reconciled the wolves and the lambs within the fold; O Babe,
that art older than Noah and younger than Noah, that reconciled all
within the ark amid the billows!

<span id="iii.v.vi-p9"></span>David Thy father for a lamb’s sake
slaughtered a lion.  Thou, O Son of David, hast killed the unseen wolf
that murdered Adam, the simple lamb who fed and bleated in Paradise.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p10"></span>At that voice of praise, brides were
moved to hallow themselves, and virgins to be chaste, and even young
girls became grave:  they advanced and came in multitudes, and
worshipped the Son.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p11"></span>Aged women of the city of David came to
the daughter of David; they gave thanks and said, “Blessed be our
country, whose streets are lightened with the rays of Jesse!  Today is
the throne of David established by Thee, O Son of David.”

<span id="iii.v.vi-p12"></span>The old men cried, “Blessed be that Son
Who restored Adam to youth, Who was vexed to see that he was old and
worn out, and that the serpent who had killed him, had changed his skin
and had gotten himself away.  Blessed be the Babe in Whom Adam and Eve
were restored to youth.”

<span id="iii.v.vi-p13"></span>The chaste women said, O Blessed Fruit,
bless the fruit of our wombs; to Thee may they be given as first-born. 
They waxed fervent and prophesied concerning their children, who, when
they were killed for Him, were cut off, as it were first-fruits.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p14"></span>The barren also fondled Him, and carried
Him; they rejoiced and said, Blessed Fruit born without marriage, bless
the wombs of us that are married; have mercy on our barrenness, Thou
wonderful Child of Virginity!
