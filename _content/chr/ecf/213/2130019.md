id="ii.v.xiii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XVII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p2"></span>To Demetrian and Valerian.

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p3"></span>Gregory to Demetrian and Valerian, clerks
of Firmum (*Fermo*).

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p4"></span>Both the ordinances of the sacred canons
and legal authority permit that ecclesiastical property may be lawfully
expended for the redemption of captives.  And so, since we are informed
by you that, nearly eighteen years ago, the most reverend Fabius, late
bishop of the Church of Firmum, paid to the enemy eleven pounds of the
silver of that Church for your redemption, and that of your father
Passivus, now our brother and fellow-bishop, but then a clerk, and also
that of your mother, and that you have some fear on this account, lest
what was given should at any time be sought to be recovered from you;—we
have thought fit by the authority of this precept to remove your
suspicion, ordaining that you and your heirs shall henceforth sustain no
annoyance for recovery of the debt, and that no process shall be
instituted against you by any one; since the rule of equity requires
that what has been paid with a pious intent should not be attended with
burden or distress to those who have been redeemed.
