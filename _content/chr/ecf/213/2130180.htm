<p class="c37"><a name="iii.iv.iv-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.iv.iv-p1.1"></A>Hymn III.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.iv-p2"></A>1.&#160; Fix thou our hearing, that it be not loosed and wander!&#160; For it is a-wandering if one enquire, who He is and what He is like.&#160; For how can we avail, to paint in us the likeness, of that Being which is like to the mind?&#160; Naught is there in it that is limited, in all of it He sees and hears; all of <A NAME="page_171"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 171</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.iv-Page_171"></A>it as it were speaks; all of it is in all senses.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.iv.iv-p3"></A>R., Praise to the One Being, that is to us unsearchable!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p4"></A>2.&#160; His aspect cannot be discerned, that it should be portrayed by our understanding:&#160; He hears without ears; He speaks without mouth; He works without hands, and He sees without eyes.&#160; Because our soul ceases not nor desists, in presence of Him Who is such; in His graciousness He put on the fashion of humankind and gathered us into His likeness.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p5"></A>3.&#160; Let us learn in what way that Being is spiritual and appeared as corporeal; and how it also is tranquil and appears as wrathful.&#160; These things were for our profit; that Being in our likeness was made like to us that we may be made like Him.&#160; One there is that is like Him, the Son Who proceeded from Him, Who is stamped with His likeness.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p6"></A>4.&#160; O Nisibis, hear these things, for, for thy sake these things were written and spoken.&#160; Both to thyself and to others, thou hast been in the world a cause of strife and of disputations.&#160; Mouths over thee, O thou that wast shut up, even over thee mouths sang; when thou didst triumph and wast enlarged, in thee mouths were opened, for lamentation and for thanksgiving.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p7"></A>5.&#160; The prayer of thy inhabitants, sufficed for thy deliverance; it was not that they were righteous, but that they were penitent:&#160; according as they were disgraced, so did they haste <i>to submit</i> to the rod.&#160; In transgressions and in triumphs they had like part.&#160; They whose crimes were great, so be their fruit great; they who triumphed in their sackcloth, have triumphed also in their crowns.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p8"></A>6.&#160; The day of thy deliverance, is king of all days.&#160; The Sabbath overthrew thy walls, it overthrew the ungrateful; the day of the Resurrection of the Son, raised <i>again</i> thy ruins; the day of Resurrection raised thee according to its name, it glorified its title.&#160; The Sabbath relaxed its watch; for the making of the breaches, it took blame to itself.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p9"></A>7.&#160; In Samaria hunger prevailed, but in thee fulness prevailed.&#160; In Samaria there broke in and came on her, abundance of a sudden; but in thee there roared and came in on thee a sea of a sudden.&#160; In her was eaten a child, and it saved her alive; in thee was eaten the body, living and all life-giving; of a sudden He delivered them, the Eaten <i>delivered</i> the eaters.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p10"></A>8.&#160; We know that the Blessed wills not the afflictions, that have been in all ages; though He has wrought them, it is our offences that are the cause of our troubles.&#160; No man can complain against our Creator; it is for Him to complain against us, who have sinned and constrained Him, to be wrathful though He wills it not, and to smite though He desires it not.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p11"></A>9.&#160; The Earth, the vine, and the olive, are in need of chastisement.&#160; When the olive is bruised, then its fruit smells sweet; when the vine is pruned, then its grapes are goodly; when the soil is ploughed its yield is goodly.&#160; When water is confined in channels, desert places drink of it; brass, silver and gold, when they are burnished shine.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p12"></A>10.&#160; If <i>then</i> it be that man, by <i>chastening</i> makes all things goodly; and if he who despises and rejects chastening, is hated and all rebels against him; <i>then</i> by that which he chastens, let him learn Him that chastens him; since whoso chastens <i>does so</i> that he may profit <i>thereby</i>.&#160; For whoso chastens his servants, <i>does so</i> that he may possess them; the good God chastens <i>His</i> servants that they may possess themselves.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p13"></A>11.&#160; Let thy afflictions be, books to admonish thee, for the thrice-besieged, suffice to become for thee, books to meditate therein, every hour on their histories.&#160; Because thou despisedst the two Testaments, wherein thou mightest read thy life, therefore He wrote for thee, three hard books wherein thou shouldst read thy chastisements.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p14"></A>12.&#160; Let us avert by that which has been, the thing that is yet to be; let us be taught by that which has come, to escape that which is coming; let us remember that which is past, to avoid that which is future.&#160; <A NAME="page_172"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 172</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.iv-Page_172"></A>Because we had forgotten the first stroke, the second fell on us; because we forgot the second, the third bore heavy on us.&#160; Who will yet again forget!</p>
