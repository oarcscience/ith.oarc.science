<span id="ii.viii.vii-p2"></span>*To all the Bishops of the Council of
Bizacium*<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span

<span id="ii.viii.vii-p4"></span>Gregory to all, &c.

<span id="ii.viii.vii-p5"></span>As it is laudable and discreet to shew
due reverence and honour to superiors, so it belongs to rectitude and
the fear of God, if anything in them needs correction, not to put it off
by any connivance, lest disease should begin to invade the whole body
(which God forbid), sickness not being cured in the head.  Now a
considerable time ago certain things were reported to us about our
brother Crementius, your primate, such as to pierce our heart with no
slight sorrow.  But through the pressure of divers tribulations, and
especially from enemies raging round us, we had not time to enquire into
the matter. And, since it is so serious that it ought by no means to be
passed over without investigation, we hereby exhort your Fraternity with
all carefulness and activity to search out in all ways the substantial
truth, in order that either if these things are so, they may be cut off
by canonical punishment, or, if they are false, the innocence of our
brother may not long lie under the laceration of an infamous report. 
Wherefore, that there may be no torpor of idleness in the enquiry, we
admonish you that neither the interest nor the favour nor the cajoleries
of any person whatever, nor anything else, soften any one of you in your
sifting of what has been reported to us, or shake you from the path of
truth; but gird ye yourselves in priestly wise to investigate the
truth.  For, if any one should presume to be sluggish, or to shew
himself negligent in this matter, let him know that he will be a
partaker in the said crimes before Almighty God, by zeal for whom he is
not moved to enquire fully into the causes of atrocious wickedness.
