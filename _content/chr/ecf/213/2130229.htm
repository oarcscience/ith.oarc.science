<p class="c16"><a name="iii.v.iv-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.v.iv-p1.1"></A>Hymn III.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.v.iv-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv-p2.1"></A>Blessed</span> be that first day of thine, Lord, wherewith this day of Thy Feast is stamped!&#160; Thy day is like Thee, in that it shows mercy unto men, in that it is handed down and comes with all generations.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p3"></A>This is the day that ends with the aged, and returns that it may begin with the young! a day that by its love refreshes itself, that it may refresh by its might us decayed creatures.&#160; Thy day when it had visited us and passed, and gone away, in its mercy returned and visited us again:&#160; for it knows that human nature needs it; in all things like unto Thee as seeking us.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p4"></A>The world is in want of its fountain; and for it, Lord, as for Thee, all therein are athirst.&#160; This is the day that rules over the seasons! the dominion of Thy day is like Thine, which stretches over generations that have come, and are to come!&#160; Thy day is like unto Thee, because when it is one, it buds and multiplies itself, that it may be like Thee!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p5"></A>In this Thy day, Lord, which is near unto us, we see Thy Birth that is far off!&#160; Like to Thee be Thy day to us, Lord; let it be a mediator and a warranter of peace.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p6"></A>Thy day reconciled Heaven and earth, because therein the Highest came down to the lowest.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p7"></A>Thy day was able to reconcile the Just One, who was wroth at our sins; Thy day forgave thousands of sins, for in it bowels of mercy shone forth upon the guilty!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p8"></A>Great, Lord, is Thy day; let it not be small upon us, let it show mercy according as it used to do, upon us transgressors!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p9"></A>And if every day, Lord, Thy forgiveness wells forth, how exceeding great should it be upon this day!&#160; All the days from the Treasure of Thy bright day gain blessings.&#160; All the feasts from the stores of this feast have their fairness and their ornaments.&#160; Thy bowels of mercy upon Thy day make Thou to abound unto us, O Lord!&#160; Make us to distinguish Thy day from all days! for great is the treasure-house of the day of Thy Birth; let it be the ransomer of debtors!&#160; Great is this day above all days, for in <A NAME="page_230"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 230</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.iv-Page_230"></A>it came forth mercy to sinners.&#160; A store of medicines is this Thy great day, because on it shone forth the Medicine of Life to the wounded!&#160; A treasure of helpful graces is this day, for that on it Light gleamed forth upon our blindness!&#160; Yea, it also brought a sheaf unto us; and it came, that from it might flow plenty upon our hunger.&#160; This day is that forerunning Cluster, in which the cup of salvation was concealed!&#160; This day is the first-born feast, which, being born the first, overcomes all feasts.&#160; In the winter which strips the fruit of the branches off from the barren vine, Fruit sprang up&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_399"></A><A HREF="#fn_399"><FONT SIZE="1">400</FONT></A>
 unto us; in the cold that bares all the trees, a shoot was green for us of the house of Jesse.&#160; In December&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_400"></A><A HREF="#fn_400"><FONT SIZE="1">401</FONT></A>
 when the seed is hidden in the earth, there sprouted forth from the Womb the Ear of Life.&#160; In March&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_401"></A><A HREF="#fn_401"><FONT SIZE="1">402</FONT></A>
 when the seed was sprouting in the air, a Sheaf&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_402"></A><A HREF="#fn_402"><FONT SIZE="1">403</FONT></A>
 sowed itself in the earth.&#160; The harvest thereof, Death devoured it in Hell; which the Medicine of life that is hidden therein did yet burst open!&#160; In March when the lambs bleat in the wilderness, into the Womb the Paschal Lamb entered!&#160; Out of the stream whence the fishers came up,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_403"></A><A HREF="#fn_403"><FONT SIZE="1">404</FONT></A>
 He was baptized and came up Who incloses all things in his net; out of the stream the fish whereof Simon took, out of it the Fisher of men came up, and took him.&#160; With the Cross which catches all robbers, He caught up unto life that robber!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_404"></A><A HREF="#fn_404"><FONT SIZE="1">405</FONT></A>
&#160; The Living by His death emptied Hell, He unloosed it and let fly away from it entire multitudes!&#160; The publicans and harlots, the impure snares, the snares of the deceitful fowler the Holy One seized!&#160; The sinful woman, who was a snare for men, He made a mirror for penitent women!&#160; The fig that cast its fruit, that refused fruit,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_405"></A><A HREF="#fn_405"><FONT SIZE="1">406</FONT></A>
 offered Zacch&aelig;us as fruit; the fruit of its own nature it gave not, but it yielded one reasonable fruit!&#160; The Lord spread His thirst over the well, and caught her that was thirsty with the water that He asked of her.&#160; He caught one soul at the well, and again caught with her the whole city:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_406"></A><A HREF="#fn_406"><FONT SIZE="1">407</FONT></A>
&#160; twelve fishers the Holy One caught, and again caught with them the whole world.&#160; As for Iscariot, that escaped from His nets, the strangling halter fell upon his neck!&#160; His all-quickening net catches the living,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_407"></A><A HREF="#fn_407"><FONT SIZE="1">408</FONT></A>
 and he that escapes from it escapes from the living.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p19"></A>And who is able, Lord, to tell me up the several succours that are hid in Thee?&#160; How shall the parched mouth be able to drink from the Fountain of the Godhead!&#160; Answer today the voice of our petition; let our prayer which is in words take effect in deeds. &#160;Heal us, O my Master; every time that we see Thy Feast, may it cause rumours that we have heard to pass away.&#160; Our mind wanders amid these voices.&#160; O Voice of the Father, still [other] voices; the world is noisy, in Thee let it gain itself quiet; for by Thee the sea was stilled from its storms.&#160; The devils rejoiced when they heard the voice of blasphemy:&#160; let the Watchers rejoice in us as they are wont.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_408"></A><A HREF="#fn_408"><FONT SIZE="1">409</FONT></A>
&#160; From amongst Thy fold there is the voice of sorrowfulness; O Thou that makest all rejoice,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_409"></A><A HREF="#fn_409"><FONT SIZE="1">410</FONT></A>
 let Thy flock rejoice! as for our murmur, O my Master, in it reject us not:&#160; our mouth murmurs since it is sinful.&#160; Let Thy day, O Lord, give us all manner of joy, with the flowers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_410"></A><A HREF="#fn_410"><FONT SIZE="1">411</FONT></A>
 of peace, let us keep Thy passover.&#160; In the day of Thy Ascension we are lifted up:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_411"></A><A HREF="#fn_411"><FONT SIZE="1">412</FONT></A>
&#160; with the new Bread shall be the memorial thereof.&#160; O Lord, increase our peace, that we may keep three feasts of the Godhead.&#160; Great is Thy day, Lord, let us not be despised.&#160; All men honour the day of Thy birth.&#160; Thou righteous One, keep Thou the glory of Thy birth; for even Herod honoured the day of His birth!&#160; The dances of the impure one pleased the tyrant; to Thee, Lord, let the voice of chaste women be sweet!&#160; Thee, Lord, let the voice of chaste women please, whose bodies Thou guardest holily.&#160; The day of Herod <A NAME="page_231"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 231</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.iv-Page_231"></A>was like him:&#160; Thy day too is like Thee!&#160; The day of the troubled one was troubled with sin; and fair as Thou art is Thy fair day!&#160; The feast of the tyrant killed the preacher; in Thy feast every man preaches glory.&#160; On the day of the murderer, the Voice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_412"></A><A HREF="#fn_412"><FONT SIZE="1">413</FONT></A>
 was put to silence; but on Thy day are the voices of the feast.&#160; The foul one in his feast put out the Light, that darkness might cover the adulterers.&#160; The season of the Holy One trims lamps, that darkness may flee with the hidden things thereof.&#160; The day of that fox&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_413"></A><A HREF="#fn_413"><FONT SIZE="1">414</FONT></A>
 stank like himself; but holy is the feast of the True Lamb.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_414"></A><A HREF="#fn_414"><FONT SIZE="1">415</FONT></A>
&#160; The day of the transgressor passed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_415"></A><A HREF="#fn_415"><FONT SIZE="1">416</FONT></A>
 away like himself; Thy day like Thyself abideth for ever.&#160; The day of the tyrant raged like himself, because with his chain it put to silence the righteous Voice.&#160; The feast of the Meek One is tranquil like Himself, because His sun shines upon His persecutors.&#160; The tyrant was conscious that He was not a king, therefore to the King of kings he gave place.&#160; The whole day, Lord, suffices me not to balance Thy praise with his blame.&#160; May Thy Gracious day cause my sin to pass away, seeing that it is with the day of the impure one, that I have weighed Thy day!&#160; For great is Thy day beyond comparison! nor can it be compared with our days.&#160; The day of man is as of the earthy:&#160; the day of God is as of God!&#160; Thy day, Lord, is greater than those of the prophets,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_416"></A><A HREF="#fn_416"><FONT SIZE="1">417</FONT></A>
 and I have taken and set it beside that of the murderer!&#160; Thou knowest, O Lord, as knowing all things, how to hear the comparison that my tongue hath made.&#160; Let Thy day grant our requests for life, since his day granted the request for death.&#160; The needy king swore on his feast that half his kingdom should be the reward of the dance!&#160; Let Thy feast then, O Thou that enrichest all, shed down in mercy a crumb of fine wheat flour!&#160; From the dry land gushed the Fountain, which sufficed to satisfy the thirst of the Gentiles!&#160; From the Virgin&#146;s womb as from a strong rock sprouted up the seed, whence was much fruit!&#160; Barns without number did Joseph fill;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_417"></A><A HREF="#fn_417"><FONT SIZE="1">418</FONT></A>
 and they were emptied and failed in the years of the famine.&#160; One true Sheaf gave bread; the bread of Heaven, whereof there is no stint.&#160; The bread which the First-born brake in the wilderness,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_418"></A><A HREF="#fn_418"><FONT SIZE="1">419</FONT></A>
 failed and passed away though very good.&#160; He returned again and broke the New Bread&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_419"></A><A HREF="#fn_419"><FONT SIZE="1">420</FONT></A>
 which ages and generations shall not waste away!&#160; The seven loaves also that He brake failed,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_420"></A><A HREF="#fn_420"><FONT SIZE="1">421</FONT></A>
 and the five loaves too that He multiplied were consumed;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_421"></A><A HREF="#fn_421"><FONT SIZE="1">422</FONT></A>
 the Bread that He brake exceeded the world&#146;s needs, for the more it was divided, the more it multiplied exceedingly.&#160; With much wine also He filled the waterpots; they drew it out, yet it failed though it was abundant:&#160; of the Cup that He gave though the draught was small, very great was its strength, so that there is no stint thereto.&#160; A Cup is He&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_422"></A><A HREF="#fn_422"><FONT SIZE="1">423</FONT></A>
 that contains all strong wines, and also a Mystery in the midst of which He Himself is!&#160; The one Bread that He brake has no bound, and the one Cup that He mingled has no stint!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_423"></A><A HREF="#fn_423"><FONT SIZE="1">424</FONT></A>
&#160; The Wheat that was sown,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_424"></A><A HREF="#fn_424"><FONT SIZE="1">425</FONT></A>
 on the third day came up and filled the Garner of Life.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_425"></A><A HREF="#fn_425"><FONT SIZE="1">426</FONT></A>
&#160; The spiritual Bread, as the Giver of it, quickens the spiritual spiritually, and he that receives it carnally, receives it rashly to no profit.&#160; This Bread of grace let the spirit receive discerningly, as the medicine of Life.&#160; If the dead sacrifices in the name of devils were offered,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_426"></A><A HREF="#fn_426"><FONT SIZE="1">427</FONT></A>
 yea eaten, not without a mystery; at the holy thing of the offering, how much more does it behove us that this mystery be circumspectly administered by us.&#160; He that eateth of the sacrifice in the name of devils, becomes devilish without all contra<A NAME="page_232"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 232</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.iv-Page_232"></A>diction.&#160; He that eateth the Heavenly Bread, becomes Heavenly without doubt!&#160; Wine teaches us, in that it makes him that is familiar therewith like itself:&#160; for it hates much him that is fond of it, and is intoxicating and maddening, and a mocker&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_427"></A><A HREF="#fn_427"><FONT SIZE="1">428</FONT></A>
 to him!&#160; Light teaches us, in that it makes like unto itself the eye the daughter of the sun:&#160; the eye by the light saw the nakedness, and ran and chastely hid the chaste man.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_428"></A><A HREF="#fn_428"><FONT SIZE="1">429</FONT></A>
&#160; As for that nakedness it was wine that made it, which even to the chaste skills not to show mercy!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p41"></A>With the weapon of the deceiver the First-born clad Himself, that with the weapon that killed, He might restore to life again!&#160; With the tree wherewith he slew us, He delivered us.&#160; With the wine which maddened us, with it we were made chaste!&#160; With the rib that was drawn out of Adam, the wicked one drew out the heart of Adam.&#160; There rose from the Rib&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_429"></A><A HREF="#fn_429"><FONT SIZE="1">430</FONT></A>
 a hidden power, which cut off Satan as Dagon:&#160; for in that Ark a book was hidden that cried and proclaimed concerning the Conqueror!&#160; There was then a mystery revealed, in that Dagon was brought low in his own place of refuge!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_430"></A><A HREF="#fn_430"><FONT SIZE="1">431</FONT></A>
&#160; The accomplishment came after the type, in that the wicked one was brought low in the place in which he trusted!&#160; Blessed be He Who came and in Him were accomplished the mysteries of the left hand, and the right hand.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_431"></A><A HREF="#fn_431"><FONT SIZE="1">432</FONT></A>
&#160; Fulfilled was the mystery that was in the Lamb, and fulfilled was the type that was in Dagon.&#160; Blessed is He Who by the True Lamb redeemed us, and destroyed our destroyer as He did Dagon!&#160; In December when the nights are long, rose unto us the Day, of Whom there is no bound!&#160; In winter when all the world is gloomy, forth came the Fair One Who cheered all in the world!&#160; In winter that makes the earth barren, virginity learned to bring forth.&#160; In December, that causes the travails of the earth to cease, in it were the travails of virginity.&#160; The early lamb no one ever used to see before the shepherds:&#160; and as for the true Lamb, in the season of His birth, the tidings of Him too hasted unto the shepherds.&#160; That old wolf saw the sucking Lamb, and he trembled before Him, though He had concealed himself; for because the wolf had put on sheep&#146;s clothing, the Shepherd of all became a Lamb in the flocks, in order that when the greedy one had been bold against the Meek, the Mighty One might rend that Eater.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_432"></A><A HREF="#fn_432"><FONT SIZE="1">433</FONT></A>
&#160; The Holy One dwelt bodily in the womb; and He dwelt spiritually in the mind.&#160; Mary that conceived Him abhorred the marriage bed; let not that soul commit whoredom in the which He dwelleth.&#160; Because Mary perceived Him, she left her betrothed:&#160; He dwelleth in chaste virgins, if they perceive Him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_433"></A><A HREF="#fn_433"><FONT SIZE="1">434</FONT></A>
&#160; The deaf perceive not the mighty thunder, neither does the heady man the sound of the commandment.&#160; For the deaf is bewildered in the time of the thunderclap, the heady man is bewildered also at the voice of instruction; if fearful thunder terrifies the deaf, then would fearful wrath stir the unclean!&#160; That the deaf hears not is no blame to him; but whoso tramples [on the commandments] it is headiness.&#160; From time to time there is thunder:&#160; but the voice of the law thunders every day.&#160; Let us not close our ears when their openings, as being opened and not closed against it, accuse us; and the door of hearing is open by nature, that it might reproach us for our headiness against our will.&#160; The door of the voice and the door of the mouth our will can open or close.&#160; Let us see what the Good One has given us; and let us hear the mighty Voice, and let not the doors of our ears be closed.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p47"></A>Glory to that Voice Which became Body, and to the Word of the High One Which became Flesh!&#160; Hear Him also, O ears, and see Him, O eyes, and feel Him, O hands, and eat Him, O mouth!&#160; Ye members and senses give praise unto Him, that came and quickened the whole body!&#160; Mary bare the silent Babe, while in Him were hidden all <A NAME="page_233"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 233</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.iv-Page_233"></A>tongues!&#160; Joseph bare Him, and in Him was hidden a nature more ancient than aught that is old!&#160; The High One became as a little child, and in Him was hidden a treasure of wisdom sufficing for all!&#160; Though Most High, yet He sucked the milk of Mary, and of His goodness all creatures suck!&#160; He is the Breast of Life, and the Breath of Life; the dead suck from His life and revive.&#160; Without the breath of the air no man lives, without the Might of the Son no man subsists.&#160; On His living breath that quickeneth all, depend the spirits that are above and that are beneath.&#160; When He sucked the milk of Mary, He was suckling all with Life.&#160; While He was lying on His Mother&#146;s bosom, in His bosom were all creatures lying.&#160; He was silent as a Babe, and yet He was making His creatures execute all His commands.&#160; For without the First-born no man can approach unto the Essence, to which He is equal.&#160; The thirty years He was in the earth, Who was ordering all creatures, Who was receiving all the offerings of praise from those above and those below.&#160; He was wholly in the depths and wholly in the highest!&#160; He was wholly with all things and wholly with each.&#160; While His body was forming within the womb, His power was fashioning all members!&#160; While the Conception of the Son was fashioning in the womb, He Himself was fashioning babes in the womb.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_434"></A><A HREF="#fn_434"><FONT SIZE="1">435</FONT></A>
&#160; Yet not as His body was weak in the womb, was His power weak in the womb!&#160; So too not as His body was feeble by the Cross, was His might also feeble by the Cross.&#160; For when on the Cross He quickened the dead, His Body quickened them, yea, rather His Will; just as when He was dwelling wholly in the womb, His hidden Will was visiting all!&#160; For see how, when He was wholly hanging upon the Cross, His Power was yet making all creatures move!&#160; For He darkened the sun and made the earth quake; He rent the graves and brought forth the dead!&#160; See how when He was wholly on the Cross, yet again He was wholly everywhere!&#160; Thus was He entirely in the womb, while He was again wholly in everything!&#160; While on the Cross He quickened the dead, so while a Babe He was fashioning babes.&#160; While He was slain, He opened the graves;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_435"></A><A HREF="#fn_435"><FONT SIZE="1">436</FONT></A>
 while He was in the womb, He opened wombs.&#160; Come hearken, my brethren, concerning the Son of the Secret One that was revealed in His Body, while His Power was concealed!&#160; For the Power of the Son is a free Power; the womb did not bind it up, as it did the Body!&#160; For while His Power was dwelling in the womb, He was fashioning infants in the womb!&#160; His Power compassed her, that compassed Him.&#160; For if He drew in His Power, all things would fall; His Power upholds all things; while He was within the womb, He left not His hold of all.&#160; He in His own Person shaped an Image in the womb, and was shaping in all wombs all countenances.&#160; Whilst He was increasing in stature among the poor, from an abundant treasury He was nourishing all!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_436"></A><A HREF="#fn_436"><FONT SIZE="1">437</FONT></A>
&#160; While she that anointed Him was anointing Him, with His dew and His rain He was anointing all!&#160; The Magi brought myrrh and gold, while in Him was hidden a treasure of riches.&#160; The myrrh and spices which He had prepared and created, did the Magi bring Him of His own.&#160; It was by Power from Him that Mary was able to bear in Her bosom Him that bears up all things!&#160; It was from the great storehouse of all creatures, Mary gave Him all which she did give Him!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_437"></A><A HREF="#fn_437"><FONT SIZE="1">438</FONT></A>
&#160; She gave Him milk from Himself that prepared it, she gave Him food from Himself that made it!&#160; He gave milk unto Mary as God:&#160; again He sucked it from her, as the Son of Man.&#160; Her hands bare Him in that He had emptied His strength; and her arm embraced Him, in that He had made Himself small.&#160; The measure of His Majesty who has measured?&#160; He caused His measures to shrink into a Raiment.&#160; She wove for Him and clothed Him because He had put off His glory.&#160; She measured Him and wove for Him, since He had made Himself little.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p52"></A><A NAME="page_234"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 234</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.iv-Page_234"></A>The sea when it bore Him was still and calmed, and how came the lap of Joseph to bear Him?&#160; The womb of hell conceived Him and was burst open, and how did the womb of Mary contain Him?&#160; The stone that was over the grave He broke open by His might, and how could Mary&#146;s arm contain Him?&#160; Thou camest to a low estate, that Thou mightest raise all to life!&#160; Glory be unto Thee from all that are quickened by Thee!&#160; Who is able to speak of the Son of the Hidden One who came down and clothed Himself with a Body in the womb?&#160; He came forth and sucked milk as a child, and among little children the Son of the Lord of all crept about.&#160; They saw Him as a little Child in the street, while there was dwelling in Him the Love of all.&#160; Visibly children surrounded Him in the street; secretly Angels surrounded Him in fear.&#160; Cheerful was He with the little ones as a child; awful was He with the Angels as a Commander:&#160; He was awful to John for him to loose His shoe&#146;s latchet:&#160; He was gentle to sinners that kissed His feet!&#160; The Angels as Angels saw Him; according to the measure of his knowledge each man beheld Him:&#160; according to the measure of each man&#146;s discernment, thus he perceived Him that is greater than all.&#160; The Father and Himself alone are a full measure of knowledge so as know Him as He is!&#160; For every creature whether above or below obtains each his measure of knowledge; He the Lord of all gives all to us.&#160; He that enriches all, requires usury of all.&#160; He gives to all things as wanting nothing, and yet requires usury of all as if needy.&#160; He gave us herds and flocks as Creator, and yet asked sacrifices as though in need.&#160; He made the water wine as Maker:&#160; and yet he drank of it as a poor man.&#160; Of His own He mingled [wine] in the marriage feast, His wine He mingled and gave to drink when He was a guest.&#160; In His love He multiplied [the days of] the aged Simeon; that he, a mortal, might present Him who quickeneth all.&#160; By power from Him did Simeon carry Him; he that presented Him, was by Him presented [to God].&#160; He gave imposition of hands to Moses in the Mount,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_438"></A><A HREF="#fn_438"><FONT SIZE="1">439</FONT></A>
 and received it in the midst of the river from John.&#160; In the power of His gifts John was enabled to baptize, though earthy, the heavenly.&#160; By power from Him the earth supported Him:&#160; it was nigh to being dissolved, and His might strengthened it.&#160; Martha gave Him to eat:&#160; viands which He had created she placed before Him.&#160; Of His own all that give have made their vows:&#160; of His own treasures they placed upon His table.</p>
