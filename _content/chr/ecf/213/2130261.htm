<p class="c30"><a name="iii.vi.xv-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iii.vi.xv-p2.1"></A>Hymn concerning our Lord and John.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.xv-p3"></A>(<span class="sc"><a name="iii.vi.xv-p3.1"></A>Resp</span>.&#8212;<i>Glory to Thee,</i> my Lord, for Thee<i>&#8212;with joy Heaven and earth worship!</i>)</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.xv-p4"></A>1.&#160; My thought bore me to Jordan,&#8212;and I saw a marvel when there was revealed&#8212;the glorious Bridegroom who to the Bride&#8212;shall bring freedom and holiness.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p5"></A>2.&#160; I saw John filled with wonder,&#8212;and the multitudes standing about him,&#8212;and the glorious Bridegroom bowed down&#8212;to the Son of the barren that he might baptize Him.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p6"></A>3.&#160; At the Word and the Voice my thought marvelled:&#8212;for lo! John was the Voice;&#8212;our Lord was manifested as the Word, that what was hidden should become revealed.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p7"></A>4.&#160; The Bride was espoused but knew not&#8212;who was the Bridegroom on whom she gazed:&#8212;the guests were assembled, the desert was filled,&#8212;and our Lord was hidden among them.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p8"></A>5.&#160; Then the Bridegroom revealed Himself;&#8212;and to John at the voice He drew near:&#8212;and the Forerunner was moved and said of Him&#8212;&#8220;This is the Bridegroom Whom I proclaimed.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p9"></A>6.&#160; He came to baptism Who baptizes all,&#8212;and He showed Himself at Jordan.&#8212;John saw Him and drew back,&#8212;deprecating, and thus he spake:&#8212;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p10"></A>7.&#160; &#8220;How, my Lord, willest Thou to be baptized,&#8212;Thou Who in Thy baptism atonest all?&#8212;Baptism looks unto Thee;&#8212;shed Thou on it holiness and perfection?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p11"></A>8.&#160; Our Lord said &#8220;I will <i>it so</i>;&#8212;draw near, baptize Me that My Will may be done.&#8212;Resist My Will thou canst not:&#8212;I shall be baptized of thee, for thus I will <i>it</i>.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p12"></A>9.&#160; &#8220;I entreat, my Lord, that I be not compelled,&#8212;for this is hard that Thou hast said to me,&#8212;&#145;I have need that thou shouldst baptize Me;&#146;&#8212;for it is Thou that with Thy hyssop purifiest all.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p13"></A>10.&#160; &#8220;I have asked it, and it pleases Me that thus it should be;&#8212;and thou, John, why gainsayest thou?&#8212;Suffer righteousness to be fulfilled,&#8212;and come, baptize Me; why standest Thou?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p14"></A>11.&#160; &#8220;How can one openly grasp&#8212;in his hands the fire that burns?&#8212;O <i>Thou that art</i> fire have mercy on me,&#8212;and bid me not come near Thee, for it is hard for me!&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p15"></A>12.&#160; &#8220;I have revealed to Thee My Will; what questionest thou?&#8212;Draw near, baptize Me, and thou shalt not be burned.&#8212;The bridechamber is ready; keep Me not back&#8212;from the wedding-feast that has been made ready.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p16"></A>13.&#160; &#8220;The Watchers fear and dare not&#8212;gaze on Thee lest they be blinded;&#8212;and I, how, O my Lord, shall I baptize Thee?&#8212;I am too weak to draw near; blame me not!&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p17"></A>14.&#160; &#8220;Thou fearest; therefore gainsay not&#8212;against My Will in what I desire:&#8212;and Baptism has respect unto Me.&#8212;Accomplish the work to which thou hast been called!&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p18"></A>15.&#160; &#8220;Lo! I proclaimed Thee at Jordan&#8212;in the ears of the people that believed not and if they shall see Thee baptized of me,&#8212;they will doubt that Thou art the Lord.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p19"></A>16.&#160; &#8220;Lo! I am <i>to be</i> baptized in their sight,&#8212;and the Father Who sent Me bears witness of Me&#8212;that I am His Son and in Me He is well pleased,&#8212;to reconcile Adam who was under <i>His</i> wrath.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p20"></A>17.&#160; &#8220;It becomes, me, O my Lord, to know my nature&#8212;that I am moulded out of the ground,&#8212;and Thou the moulder Who formest all things:&#8212;I, then, why should I baptize Thee in water?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p21"></A><A NAME="page_285"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 285</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vi.xv-Page_285"></A>18.&#160; &#8220;It becomes thee to know wherefore I am come,&#8212;and for what cause I have desired that thou shouldst baptize Me.&#8212;It is the middle of the way wherein I have walked;&#8212;withhold thou not Baptism.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p22"></A>19.&#160; &#8220;Small is the river whereto Thou art come,&#8212;that Thou shouldst lodge therein and it should cleanse Thee.&#8212;The heavens suffice not for Thy mightiness;&#8212;how much less shall Baptism contain Thee!&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p23"></A>20.&#160; &#8220;The womb is smaller than Jordan;&#8212;yet was I willing to lodge in the Virgin:&#8212;and as I was born from woman,&#8212;so too am I <i>to be</i> baptized in Jordan.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p24"></A>21.&#160; &#8220;Lo! the hosts are standing!&#8212;the ranks of Watchers, lo! they worship!&#8212;And if I draw near, my Lord, to baptize Thee,&#8212;I tremble for myself with quaking.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p25"></A>22.&#160; &#8220;The hosts and multitudes call thee happy,&#8212;all of them, for that thou baptizest Me.&#8212;For this I have chosen thee from the womb:&#8212;fear thou not, for I have willed <i>it.</i></p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p26"></A>23.&#160; &#8220;I have prepared the way as I was sent:&#8212;I have betrothed the Bride as I was commanded.&#8212;May Thy Epiphany be spread over the world&#8212;now that Thou art come, and let me not baptize Thee!&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p27"></A>24.&#160; &#8220;This is My preparation, for so have I willed;&#8212;I will go down and be baptized in Jordan,&#8212;and make bright the armour for them that are baptized,&#8212;that they may be white in Me and I not be conquered.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p28"></A>25.&#160; &#8220;Son of the Father, why should I baptize Thee?&#8212;for lo! Thou art in Thy Father and Thy Father in Thee.&#8212;Holiness unto the priests Thou givest;&#8212;water that is common wherefore askest Thou?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p29"></A>26.&#160; &#8220;The children of Adam look unto Me,&#8212;that I should work for them the new birth.&#8212;A way in the waters I will search out for them,&#8212;and if I be not baptized <i>this</i> cannot be.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p30"></A>27.&#160; &#8220;Pontiffs of Thee are consecrated,&#8212;priests by Thy hyssop are purified;&#8212;the anointed and the kings Thou makest.&#8212;Baptism, how shall it profit <i>Thee</i>?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p31"></A>28.&#160; &#8220;The Bride thou betrothedst to Me awaits Me,&#8212;that I should go down, be baptized, and sanctify her.&#8212;Friend of the Bridegroom withhold Me not&#8212;from the washing that awaits Me.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p32"></A>29.&#160; &#8220;I am not able, for I am weak,&#8212;Thy blaze in my hands to grasp.&#8212;Lo! Thy legions are as flame;&#8212;bid one of the Watchers baptize Thee!&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p33"></A>30.&#160; &#8220;Not from the Watchers was My Body assumed,&#8212;that I should summon a Watcher to baptize Me.&#8212;The body of Adam, lo! I have put on,&#8212;and thou, son of Adam, art to baptize Me.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p34"></A>31.&#160; &#8220;The waters saw Thee, and greatly feared;&#8212;the waters saw Thee, and lo! they tremble!&#8212;The river foams in its terror;&#8212;and I <i>that am</i> weak, how shall I baptize Thee?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p35"></A>32.&#160; &#8220;The waters in My Baptism are sanctified,&#8212;and fire and the Spirit from Me shall they receive;&#8212;and if I be not baptized they are not made perfect&#8212;to be fruitful of children that shall not die.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p36"></A>33.&#160; &#8220;Fire, if to Thy fire it draw near,&#8212;shall be burnt up of it as stubble.&#8212;The mountains of Sinai endured Thee not,&#8212;and I <i>that am</i> weak, wherein shall I baptize Thee?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p37"></A>34.&#160; &#8220;I am the flaming fire;&#8212;yet for man&#146;s sake I became a babe&#8212;in the virgin womb of the maiden.&#8212;And now I am to be baptized in Jordan.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p38"></A>35.&#160; &#8220;It is very meet that Thou shouldst baptize me,&#8212;for Thou hast holiness to purify all.&#8212;In Thee it is that the defiled are made holy; but Thou <i>that art</i> holy, why art Thou to be baptized?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p39"></A><A NAME="page_286"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 286</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vi.xv-Page_286"></A>36.&#160; &#8220;It is very right that thou shouldst baptize Me,&#8212;as I bid, and shouldst not gainsay.&#8212;Lo! I baptized thee within the womb;&#8212;baptize thou me in Jordan!&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p40"></A>37.&#160; &#8220;I am a bondman and I am weak.&#8212;Thou that freest all have mercy on me!&#160; Thy latchets to unloose I am not able;&#8212;Thy exalted head who will make me worthy <i>to touch</i>?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p41"></A>38.&#160; &#8220;Bondmen in My Baptism are set free;&#8212;handwritings in My washing are blotted out;&#8212;manumissions in the water are sealed ;&#8212;and if I be not baptized all these come to nought.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p42"></A>39.&#160; &#8220;A mantle of fire the air wears,&#8212;and waits for Thee, above Jordan;&#8212;and if Thou consentest to it and willest to be baptized,&#8212;Thou shalt baptize Thyself and fulfil all.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p43"></A>40.&#160; &#8220;This is meet, that thou shouldst baptize Me,&#8212;that none may err and say concerning Me,&#8212;&#145;Had He not been alien from the Father&#146;s house,&#8212;why feared the Levite to baptize Him?&#146;&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p44"></A>41.&#160; &#8220;The prayer, then, when Thou art baptized,&#8212;how shall I complete over Jordan?&#8212;When the Father and the Spirit are seen over Thee,&#8212;Whom shall I call on, as priest?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p45"></A>42.&#160; &#8220;The prayer in silence is to be completed:&#8212;come, thy hand alone lay thou on Me.&#8212;and the Father shall utter in the priest&#146;s stead&#8212;that which is meet concerning His Son.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p46"></A>43.&#160; &#8220;They that are bidden, lo! all of them stand;&#8212;the Bridegroom&#146;s guests, lo! they bear witness&#8212;that day by day I said among them,&#8212;&#145;I am the Voice and not the Word.&#146;&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p47"></A>44.&#160; &#8220;Voice of him that cries in the wilderness,&#8212;fulfil thou the work for which thou camest,&#8212;that the desert whereunto thou wentest out may resound&#8212;with the mighty peace thou preachedst therein.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p48"></A>45.&#160; &#8220;The shout of the Watchers has come to my ears;&#8212;lo! I hear from the Father&#146;s house&#8212;the hosts that sound forth the cry,&#8212;&#145;In Thy Epiphany, O Bridegroom, the worlds have life.&#146;&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p49"></A>46.&#160; &#8220;The time hastes on, and the marriage guests&#8212;look to Me to see what is doing.&#8212;Come, baptize Me, that they may give praise&#8212;to the Voice of the Father when it is heard!&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p50"></A>47.&#160; &#8220;I hearken, my Lord, according to Thy Word:&#8212;come to Baptism as Thy love constrains Thee!&#8212;The dust worships that whereunto he has attained,&#8212;that on Him Who fashioned him he should lay his hand.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p51"></A>48.&#160; The <i>heavenly</i> ranks were silent as they stood,&#8212;and the Bridegroom went down into Jordan;&#8212;the Holy One was baptized and straightway went up,&#8212;and His Light shone forth on the world.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p52"></A>49.&#160; The doors of the highest were opened above,&#8212;and the voice of the Father was heard,&#8212;&#8220;This is my Beloved in Whom I am well pleased.&#8221;&#8212;All ye peoples, come and worship Him.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xv-p53"></A>50.&#160; They that saw were amazed as they stood, at the Spirit Who came down and bare witness to Him.&#8212;Praise to Thy Epiphany that gladdens all,&#8212;Thou in Whose revelation the worlds are lightened!</p>
