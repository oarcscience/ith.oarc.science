<p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.xxxv-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="ii.v.xxxv-p1.1"></A>Epistle LXXVIII.</span></p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ii.v.xxxv-p2"></A>To Eulogius, Patriarch of Alexandria.</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="ii.v.xxxv-p3"></A>Gregory to Eulogius, &amp;c.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.v.xxxv-p4"></A>I have received at the hands of the bearer of these presents the letter of your most sweet Holiness, speaking to me about your cause being terminated speedily.&#160; But, as soon as he had come, he learnt how the possession which he sought from our Church was held, and soon satisfied himself about it.&#160; The business he had with others he settled without contention.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.v.xxxv-p5"></A>But concerning the matter which ought by all means to have been written about to me, your Holiness has written nothing, considering me also to be tardy therein.&#160; And indeed, for fear of its breaking out into the scandal of division, I have been unwilling to be the author of such division.&#160; For I have chosen that whatever may follow should ensue through others.&#160; But in time to come, God granting it, you will have proof that in a cause wherein I desire to please God I am not afraid of men.&#160; Concerning this I took care to write to you before now, even when you went to Constantinople.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.v.xxxv-p6"></A>As to the timber, I had prepared pieces of a larger size, as your Blessedness had requested in your letter; but so small a ship has been sent here that it could not carry them, <A NAME="page_20"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 20</FONT></A> <a name="ii.v.xxxv-Page_20"></A>unless they had been cut.&#160; But I was unwilling to have them cut, and have reserved for your judgment what should be done about them.&#160; If you do not require them, we will adapt them for other uses here.&#160; Moreover, I beg of your Holiness to pray for me earnestly, since I am incessantly pressed down by pains of gout, and swords of barbarians, and distressing cares.&#160; But, if you bestow on me the help of your prayer, I believe that you will strongly aid me against all adversities.</p>
