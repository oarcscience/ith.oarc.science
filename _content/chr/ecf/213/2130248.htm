<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p4"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p4.1"></A>Resp</span>.&#8212;<i>To Thee be praise from Thy flock in the day of Thy Epiphany!</i></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p5"></A>1.&#160; The heavens He has renewed, for that fools worshipped all the luminaries:&#8212;He has renewed the earth, for that in Adam it was wasted.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_508"></A><A HREF="#fn_508"><FONT SIZE="1">509</FONT></A>
&#8212;That which He fashioned has become new by His spittle:&#8212;and the All-Sufficing has restored bodies with souls.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p7"></A>2.&#160; Gather yourselves again ye&#8212;sheep and without labour receive cleansing!&#8212;for one needs not as Elisha&#8212;to bathe seven times in the river, nor again to be wearied as the priests are wearied with sprinklings.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p8"></A>3.&#160; Seven times Elisha purified himself in a mystery of the seven spirits;&#8212;and the hyssop and blood are a mighty symbol.&#8212;There is no room for division;&#8212;<i>He</i> is not divided from the Lord of all Who is Son of the Lord of all.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p9"></A>4.&#160; Moses sweetened in Marah the waters that were bitter,&#8212;because the People complained and murmured:&#8212;<i>Thus</i> he gave a sign of baptism,&#8212;wherein the Lord of life makes sweet them that were bitter.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p10"></A>5.&#160; The cloud overshadowed and kept off the burning heat from the camp;&#8212;it showed a symbol of the Holy Spirit, which overshadows you in baptism&#8212;tempering the flaming fire <i>that it harm not</i> your bodies.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p11"></A>6.&#160; Through the sea the People then passed, and showed a symbol&#8212;of the baptism wherein ye were washed.&#160; The People passed through that and believed not:&#8212;the Gentiles were baptized in this and believed and received the Holy Ghost.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p12"></A>7.&#160; The Word sent the Voice to proclaim before His Coming,&#8212;to prepare for Him the way by which He came,&#8212;and to betroth the Bride till He should come,&#8212;that she might be ready when He should come and take her from the water.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p13"></A>8.&#160; The voice of prophecy stirred the son of the barren woman,&#8212;and he went forth wandering in the desert and crying,&#8212;&#8220;Lo! the Son of the Kingdom comes!&#8212;prepare ye the way that He may enter and abide in your dwellings!&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p14"></A>9.&#160; John cried, &#8220;Who comes after me, He is before me:&#8212;I am the Voice but not the Word;&#8212;I am the torch but not the Light;&#8212;the Star that rises before the Sun of Righteousness.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p15"></A>10.&#160; In the wilderness this John had cried and had said,&#8212;&#8220;Repent ye sinners of your evils,&#8212;and offer the fruits of repentance;&#8212;for lo! He comes that winnows the wheat from the tares.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p16"></A>11.&#160; The Lightgiver has prevailed and marked a mystery, by the degrees he ascended:&#8212;Lo! there are twelve days since he ascended,&#8212;and to-day this is the thirteenth:&#8212;a perfect mystery of Him, the Son, and His twelve!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p17"></A><A NAME="page_266"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 266</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vi.ii-Page_266"></A>12.&#160; Darkness was overcome to make it manifest that Satan was overcome;&#8212;and the Light prevailed that he should proclaim&#8212;that the Firstborn triumphs:&#160; darkness was overcome&#8212;with the Dark Spirit, and our Light prevailed with the Lightgiver.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p18"></A>13.&#160; In the Height and the Depth the Son had two heralds.&#8212;The star of light proclaimed Him from above;&#8212;John likewise preached Him from beneath:&#8212;two heralds, the earthly and the heavenly.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p19"></A>14.&#160; The star of light, contrary to nature, shone forth of a sudden;&#8212;less than the sun yet greater than the sun.&#8212;Less was it than he in manifest light;&#8212;and greater than he in secret might because of its mystery.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p20"></A>15.&#160; The star of light shed its rays among them that were in darkness,&#8212;and guided them as though they were blind;&#8212;so that they came and met the great Light:&#8212;they gave offerings and received life and adored and departed.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p21"></A>16.&#160; The <i>herald</i> from above showed His Nature to be from the Most High;&#8212;likewise he <i>that was</i> from beneath showed His Body to be from humankind, mighty marvel!&#8212;that His Godhead and His Manhood by them were proclaimed!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p22"></A>17.&#160; Thus whoso reckons Him as of earth, the star of light&#8212;will convince him that He is of Heaven:&#160; and whoso reckons Him as of spirit,&#8212;this John will convince him that He is also bodily.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p23"></A>18.&#160; John drew near with his parents and worshipped the Sun,&#8212;and brightness rested on His Face.&#8212;He was not moved as when in the womb.&#8212;Mighty marvel! that here he worships and there he leaped!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p24"></A>19.&#160; The whole creation became for Him as one mouth and cried out concerning Him.&#8212;The Magi cry out in their gifts;&#8212;the barren cry out with their children;&#8212;the star of light, lo! it cries out in the air, &#8220;Behold the Son of the King!&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p25"></A>20.&#160; The heavens are opened, the waters break forth, the dove is in glory!&#8212;The voice of the Father is stronger than thunder,&#8212;as it utters the word, &#8220;This <i>is</i> My Beloved&#8221;;&#8212;the Watchers brought the tidings, the children acclaimed <i>Him</i> in their Hosannas.</p>
