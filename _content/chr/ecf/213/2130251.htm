<p class="c16"><a name="iii.vi.v-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.vi.v-p1.1"></A>Hymn IV.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.v-p2"></A>(<span class="sc"><a name="iii.vi.v-p2.1"></A>Resp</span>.&#8212;<i>Blessed be He that blots out in water misdeeds that are without measure!</i>)</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.v-p3"></A>1.&#160; Descend my sealed brethren, put ye on our Lord,&#8212;and be rejoined to His lineage, for He is son of a great lineage,&#8212;as He has said in His Word.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p4"></A>2.&#160; From on high is His Nature, and from beneath His Vesture.&#8212;Each that puts off his vesture, commingled is that vesture, with His Vesture forever.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p5"></A>3.&#160; Ye too in the water, receive from him the vesture,&#8212;that wastes not or is lost for it is the vesture that vests&#8212;them that are vested in it forever.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p6"></A>4.&#160; But the blessed Priest, is daysman between two:&#8212;the covenant shall be made before Him, He is daysman of his Lord,&#8212;and surety on our part.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p7"></A>5.&#160; The Godhead in the water, lo! has mingled His leaven;&#8212;for the creatures of dust, that leaven raises up,&#8212;and the Godhead joins them.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p8"></A>6.&#160; For it is the leaven of the Lord, that can glide into the bondman,&#8212;and raise him to freedom; it has joined the bondman to the lineage,&#8212;of Him the Lord of all.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p9"></A>7.&#160; For the bondman who has put on Him, Who makes all free in the waters,&#8212;though bondman he be on earth, is son of the free on high,&#8212;for freedom he has put on.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p10"></A>8.&#160; The freeman who has put on, that Angel in the waters,&#8212;is as the fellow of servants, that he may be made like to the Lord,&#8212;Who became bondman unto bondmen.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p11"></A>9.&#160; He Who enriches all came down, and put on poverty,&#8212;that He might divide to the poor, the stores that were hidden,&#8212;out of the treasure-house of the water.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p12"></A>10.&#160; The lowly one again that has put on, the Giver of all greatness, in the water,&#8212;even though he be base in the sight of fools, yet is great in the sight of the Watchers,&#8212;for that he is clad in greatness.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p13"></A>11.&#160; For like as He Who is great, Who became lowly in His love,&#8212;by the unbelievers was persecuted, and by the Watchers was worshipped,&#8212;was made lowly and makes the lowly great.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p14"></A>12.<i>&#160; Thus</i> let him be lowly who is great, that in him the lowly may be great:&#8212;Let <A NAME="page_272"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 272</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vi.v-Page_272"></A>us be like to Him Who is greater than all, Who became less than all:&#8212;He was made lowly, and makes all <i>men</i> great.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p15"></A>13.&#160; The meek man who has put on Him Who is great, in the water,&#8212;though humble <i>be</i> his countenance, very great is his discernment,&#8212;for He Who is exalted above all dwells in him.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p16"></A>14.&#160; For who could be found to despise the bush of thorn,&#8212;the despised and humble, wherein the Majesty in fire,&#8212;made its dwelling within?</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p17"></A>15.&#160; Who again could be found, to despise Moses,&#8212;the meek and slow of speech,&#8212;when that excelling glory&#8212;dwelt upon his meekness?</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p18"></A>16.&#160; They that despised him despised his Lord; the wicked that despised him&#8212;the earth swallowed up in anger; the Levites who scorned Him,&#8212;the fire devoured in fury.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p19"></A>17.&#160; Of Him Christ commanded, &#8220;Thou shalt not call him Raca,&#8221; who is baptized and has put Him on; for whoso despises the despised, despises with him the Mighty.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p20"></A>18.&#160; In Eden and in the world, are parables of our Lord;&#8212;and what tongue can gather, the similitudes of His mysteries?&#8212;for He is figured all of Him in all things.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p21"></A>19.&#160; In the Scriptures He is written of; on Nature He is impressed;&#8212;His crown is figured in kings, in prophets His truth, His atonement in priests.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p22"></A>20.&#160; In the rod was He of Moses, and in the hyssops of Aaron,&#8212;and in the crown of David:&#160; to the prophets <i>pertains</i> His similitude, to the Apostles His Gospel.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p23"></A>21.&#160; Revelations beheld Thee, proverbs looked for Thee,&#8212;mysteries expected Thee, similitudes saluted Thee, parables showed types of Thee.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p24"></A>22.&#160; The Covenant of Moses looked forward to the Gospel:&#8212;all things of old time, flew on and alighted thereon, in the new Covenant.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p25"></A>23.&#160; Lo! the prophets have poured out on Him, their glorious mysteries;&#8212;the priests and kings have poured out upon Him, their wonderful types:&#8212;they all have poured <i>them</i> out on all of Him.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p26"></A>24.&#160; Christ overcame and surpassed, by His teachings the mysteries,&#8212;by His interpretations the parables; as the sea into its midst&#8212;receives all streams.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.v-p27"></A>25.&#160; For Christ is the sea, and He can receive&#8212;the fountains and brooks, the rivers and streams, that flow from the midst of the Scriptures.</p>
