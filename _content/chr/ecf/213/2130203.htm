<p class="c37"><a name="iii.iv.xxvii-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.iv.xxvii-p1.1"></A>Hymn XXXVIII.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xxvii-p2"></A>1.&#160; My throne was set for me in Sheol:&#160; and one arose that was dead, and hurled me from it.&#160; Every man feared me alone, and I feared no man.&#160; Terror and trouble <i>were</i> among the living, rest and peace among the dead. In a man that was slain lo! there has entered into Sheol He that takes her captive. I used to take all men captive: the Son of Captivity Whom I took captive has taken me captive. He Whom I took captive has led her away and is gone to Paradise.&#160; <i>R., Blessed is He Who has quickened the dead of Sheol by His Cross!</i></p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xxvii-p3"></A>2.&#160; All men complain much against me; and I against one only have complained.&#160; Who is there among men so just as I?&#160; Has corruption touched my integrity?&#160; I held all men in affection, and whoso hates me knows <i>it</i>; I know not all my days what a bribe is.&#160; The person of a king have I not accepted.&#160; By me is preached equality, for bondman and his lord in Sheol I make equal.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xxvii-p4"></A>3.&#160; Before God it is that I minister, with Whom is no acceptance of persons.&#160; What other is there that endures as I do, I that am cursed when I do good?&#160; Perversely are requited to me the benefits I have rendered.&#160; Though my deeds are goodly, my name is not goodly.&#160; Yet my mind rests in its integrity:&#160; in God it is that I comfort myself; for though He is good He is denied every day and endures <i>it</i>.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xxvii-p5"></A>4.&#160; The old I remove from all sufferings, likewise the young from all sins.&#160; Secret contention I quell in Sheol; in our land there is no iniquity:&#160; it is Sheol and Heaven alone, that are removed from all sins; this earth that lies between, in her iniquity dwells.&#160; He therefore that is prudent will either go up into Heaven, or, if that be <i>too</i> hard, will go down to Sheol which is easy.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xxvii-p6"></A>5.&#160; To one man because of one that is dead, every man hastes to comfort <i>him</i>.&#160; But for me though many of my dead have come to life, there is none that comes in and comforts me.&#160; Satan came in, against Whom, had been proclaimed seven woes even against him; though mightily the Son of Mary had trodden on him, <i>yet</i> uplifted is his spirit; for he is the serpent that strives though bruised.&#160; Better is it for me to fall and worship, before this Jesus Who has conquered me by His Cross.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xxvii-p7"></A>6.&#160; When He enters at the gate of Sheol, in place of John who preached before His coming, then will I cry &#8220;Lo! He that quickens the dead is come; Thy servant am I from henceforth, Jesu!&#160; Because of The Body I <A NAME="page_200"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 200</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.xxvii-Page_200"></A>reviled Thee, for it covered Thy Godhead.&#160; Be not angry, O Son of the King, against Thy treasury; at Thy command I have opened and closed.&#160; Though my wings <i>be</i> very swift it is at thy nod I haste to every quarter.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xxvii-p8"></A>7.&#160; All that have been raised were not first born; for our Lord is the First-born of Sheol.&#160; How can <i>any that</i> is dead go before Him, that power whereby he was raised?&#160; There are last that are first, and younger that have become first-born.&#160; For though Manasseh was first-born, how could it be that Ephraim should take the birthright?&#160; And if the second born was set before him, how much rather shall the Lord and Creator prevent <i>all</i> in His Resurrection!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xxvii-p9"></A>8.&#160; Lo! John as a herald declares that he is later, though he was elder-born; for he said, &#8220;Behold a man cometh after me, and yet He was before me.&#8221;&#160; For how could he be before Him, that Power in Whom he preached?&#160; For everything that comes to pass because of <i>another</i> thing, is after <i>that other</i> even though it <i>seem to</i> be before.&#160; For the cause which called it <i>into being</i>, is elder <i>than it</i> and before <i>it</i> in all things.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xxvii-p10"></A>9.&#160; The cause of Adam was elder than <i>all</i> creatures, which were made for him, for to him even to Adam He had respect continually, the Creator even while he was creating.&#160; Thus though Adam as yet was not, he was elder than <i>all</i> creatures.&#160; How much more then, my Lord, must this Thy manhood be elder, which in Thy Godhead is, from eternity with Him that begat Thee!&#160; To Thee <i>be</i> praise and through Thee to Thy Father from us all!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xxvii-p11"></A>10.&#160; To Thee <i>be</i> praise for Thou art the first, in Thy Godhead and in Thy manhood!&#160; For even though Elijah was first to go up, he was not able to prevent Him, for whose sake he was taken up.&#160; For his type depended on Thy verity:&#160; and even though the types apparently are before Thy fulfilment, it is before them secretly.&#160; Creatures were before Adam; he was before them because for his sake they were made.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xxvii-p12"></A>11.&#160; O my Lord, work for me this resurrection, not of Thy compulsion but of Thy love.&#160; For Thy compulsion gives life to sinners also:&#160; Iscariot would rather again choose for himself the death of Sheol, than the life of Gehenna.&#160; Work for me then the resurrection that is of Thy mercy; and even though Thy justice permits not, let there be occasion for Thy grace.&#160; This only let it remember for me, that in it I have sought refuge.</p>
