<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xl-p2"></A>1. O what amazement befel the Evil One, of a sudden, my brethren:&#160; when the sinful woman was corrected, and gained Wisdom!&#8212;2. <i>R., Glory to the One Who alone, conquered the Evil One; and to Him yea Him be also confession, Who vanquished Death!</i>&#8212;3.&#160; <A NAME="page_213"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 213</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.xl-Page_213"></A>The Evil One marvelled &#8220;Where <i>is</i> her laughter? where her perfumes? where her dancing and outward ornament, and inward wickedness?&#8221;&#8212;4. Instead of that light laughter, she is given up to tears:&#160; She has cut off her hair to wipe the dust, off the feet of Jesus.&#8212;5. Naught lasts in her of any doctrine, nor abides in her:&#160; from our instruction she has escaped and cast away, all that I taught her.&#8212;6. She has denied us and our acquaintance, and even as though:&#160; she had never seen me she has blotted my image, out of her mind.&#8212;7. The living leaven of Jesus flew to her, Jesus was silent:&#160; but she made bold to press and enter, though none called her.&#8212;8. She forgot our love of <i>many</i> years, and in the twinkling of an eye:&#160; from between me and her she removed <i>it, and</i> set Death <i>there</i>.&#8212;9. For instead of laughter weeping delights her, and instead of paint:&#160; a shower of tears, and instead of ornament, a sad countenance.&#8212;10. Zaccheus I made chief of extortioners, and her I made:&#160; chief of wantons; my two wings, Jesus has broken.&#8212;11. If so be Zaccheus becomes <i>his</i> disciple, and if so be she:&#160; becomes <i>his</i> hearer, henceforth they fetter, my craftiness.&#8212;12. Carved images henceforth are a mockery and the carvers:&#160; a derision, and the worshippers a laughing-stock.&#8212;13. I shut <i>men&#146;s</i> eyes that they might not perceive, that they are carved images:&#160; Jesus opens their eyes to see that they are the works of <i>men&#146;s hands</i>.&#8212;14. If Jesus has chosen for Himself preachers, then our preaching:&#160; whereof the whole world is full, is put to silence.&#8212;15. For lo! the Chaldeans with the soothsayers, and lo! the wizards:&#160; with the diviners they are smitten and the priests, with all evil ones!&#8212;16. Ye priests are ended and have given up the Ghost from henceforth, depart ye diviners! become husbandmen, the Chaldeans likewise, shall close their books.&#8212;17. If the Hebrews have become His disciples, who by all miracles:&#160; were not subdued, who of the nations, shall not obey him?&#8212;18. If he begins to set straight the reverse, He brings to naught our speech:&#160; henceforth He will not hesitate against us, He who rebukes all men.&#8212;19. In that I was worshipped in all temples, our disgrace is greater:&#160; than our honour <i>was</i>, for all men spit, upon our altars.&#8212;20. Flesh of sacrifice becomes abhorred, into fragments:&#160; idols are <i>broken</i>, and carven images burn, under their pots.&#8212;21. All our work becomes a laughing-stock, and a ruin:&#160; all that we have built, and a mockery, all that we have taught.&#8212;22. The secret mysteries that I taught them, laboriously:&#160; are about to be spread abroad, on the housetops.&#8212;23. Of the Egyptians I was more proud, than of any nation:&#160; for they used to worship even, the onions and garlic.&#8212;24. Lo! I fear lest even here, where delusion was so great:&#160; truth shall prevail that there exceedingly, Jesus may reign.&#8212;25. And if when He was an infant, and fled and went down, Egypt marvelled:&#160; yea lulled him&#8212;this strangler of babes, loved their Babe.&#8212;26. Was it a pledge He went down to give her, as a betrother:&#160; giving assurance that when of full age, He will also take her <i>to wife</i>?&#8212;27. Pharaoh cannot set his foot <i>firm</i>, for this is no stammerer:&#160; that he should deceive Him, and no bondman, that he should lie unto Him.&#8212;28. Moses smote and the Egyptians rebelled, and he chastised the people:&#160; and the Hebrews rebelled&#8212;Jesus is smitten, and gives life to all.&#8212;29. This is hard <i>to understand</i> that not by force; lays He His yoke:&#160; on the rebellious:&#160; He was rebuked, and He instructs others.&#8212;30. The spittle of His mouth, wiped off and took away, the shame of Adam:&#160; by the smiting of His cheeks, He rooted out our wrathfulness, from His disciples.&#8212;31. By the nails which he received, He made me to suffer.&#160; I rejoiced when I crucified Him:&#160; and I knew not that He was crucifying me, in His crucifixion.</p>
