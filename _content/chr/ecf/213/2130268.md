<span id="iii.vii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.vii.v-p1.1"></span>Hymn IV.</span>

<span id="iii.vii.v-p2"></span>1.  The thief gained the faith which
gained him, <span id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533) and brought him up
and placed him in paradise.  He saw in the Cross a tree of life; that
was the fruit, he was the eater in Adam’s stead.

<span id="iii.vii.v-p4"></span>The fool, who goes astray, grazes the
faith, as it were an eye, <span id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534) by all
manner of questions.  The probing of the finger blinds the eye, and much
more doth that prying blind. the faith.

<span id="iii.vii.v-p6"></span>For even the diver pries not into his
pearl.  In it do all merchants rejoice without prying into whence it
came; even the king who is crowned therewith does not explore it.

<span id="iii.vii.v-p7"></span>2.  Because Balaam was foolish, a foolish
beast in the ass spoke with him, because he despised God Who spoke with
him.  Thee too let the pearl reprove in the ass’s stead.

<span id="iii.vii.v-p8"></span>The people that had a heart of stone, by
a Stone He set at nought, <span id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535) for
lo, a stone hears words.  Witness its work that has reproved them; and
you, ye deaf ones, let the pearl reprove today.

<span id="iii.vii.v-p10"></span>With the swallow <span
id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536) and the crow did He put men to shame;
with the ox, yea with the ass, <span id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537)
did He put them to shame; let the pearl reprove now, O ye birds and
things on earth and things below.

<span id="iii.vii.v-p13"></span>3.  Not as the moon does thy light fill
or wane; the Sun whose light is greater than all, lo! of Him it is that
a type is shadowed out in thy little compass.  O type of the Son, one
spark of Whom is greater than the sun!—

<span id="iii.vii.v-p14"></span>The pearl itself is full, for its light
is full; neither is there any cunning worker who can steal from it; for
its wall is its own beauty, yea, its guard also!  It lacks not, since it
is entirely perfect.

<span id="iii.vii.v-p15"></span>And if a man would break thee to take a
part from thee, thou art like the faith which with the heretics
perishes, seeing they have broken it in pieces and spoiled it:  for is
it any better than this to have the faith scrutinised?

<span id="iii.vii.v-p16"></span>The faith is an entire nature that may
not be corrupted.  The spoiler gets himself <span id="page_297">p.
297</span> <span id="iii.vii.v-Page_297"></span>mischief by it:  the
heretic brings ruin on himself thereby.  He that chases the light from
his pupils blinds himself.

<span id="iii.vii.v-p17"></span>Fire and air are divided when sundered. 
Light alone, of all creatures, as its Creator, is not divided; it is not
barren, for that it also begets without losing thereby.

<span id="iii.vii.v-p18"></span>4.  And if a man thinks that thou art
framed \[by art\] he errs greatly; thy nature proclaims that thou, as
all stones, art not the framing of art; and so thou art a type of the
Generation which no making framed.

<span id="iii.vii.v-p19"></span>Thy stone flees from a comparison with
the Stone \[which is\] the Son.  For thy own generation is from the
midst of the deep, that of the Son of thy Creator is from the highest
height; He is not like thee, in that He is like His Father.

<span id="iii.vii.v-p20"></span>And as they tell, two wombs bare thee
also.  Thou camest down from on high a fluid nature; thou camest up from
the sea a solid body.  By means of thy second birth thou didst show thy
loveliness to the children of men.

<span id="iii.vii.v-p21"></span>Hands fixed thee, when thou wast
embodied, into thy receptacles; for thou art in the crown as upon a
cross, and in a coronet as in a victory; thou art upon the ears, as if
to fill up what was lacking; thou extendest over all.
