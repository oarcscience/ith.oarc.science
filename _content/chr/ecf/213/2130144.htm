<p class="c22"><a name="ii.ix.xiv-p2"></A>To Pantaleo, Notary.</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="ii.ix.xiv-p3"></A>Gregory to Pantaleo, &amp;c.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ix.xiv-p4"></A>Thy Experience remembers what and what kind of oath thou tookest over the most sacred body of the blessed apostle Peter.&#160; Whence also we committed to thee without fear the charge of enquiry in the patrimony of the Syracusan district.&#160; It is, then, incumbent on thee to have thine own good faith and the fear of the same blessed apostle Peter ever before thine eyes, and so to act that neither with men in this present life nor with Almighty God in the last judgment thou mayest be open to blame.&#160; Now from the report of Salerius our <i>chartularius</i> we have learnt that thou hast found the <i>modius</i> in which the husbandmen (<i>coloni</i>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_218"></A><A HREF="#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">219</FONT></A>
 of the Church have been compelled to give their corn to be one of twenty-five <i>sextarii</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_219"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">220</FONT></A>
.&#160; This we altogether execrated, and were sorry thou hadst been late in making it a subject of enquiry.&#160; We rejoice, therefore, at thy telling us that thou hast broken the said <i>modius</i> and made a just one.&#160; But, inasmuch as the aforesaid <i>chartularius</i> has taken care to mention also what has already been collected under thy Experience by the fraudulent dealings of the farmers (<i>conductores</i>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">221</FONT></A>
 from two territories, therefore, even as with a view to the future, we rejoice that thou hast acted zealously in breaking the unjust <i>modius</i>, so also we think of sins in the past; lest, if what the farmers have fraudulently taken away from the peasants (<i>rusticis</i>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">222</FONT></A>
 accrues to us, we should <A NAME="page_100"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 100</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ix.xiv-Page_100"></A>be implicated in their sins.&#160; And accordingly we desire thy Experience, with all faithfulness, with all integrity&#8212;having regard to the fear of Almighty God, and recalling to mind the strictness of the blessed apostle Peter&#8212;to make a list throughout each several estate (<i>massam</i>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">223</FONT></A>
 of poor and indigent husbandmen, and with the money found to have been got by fraud to procure cows, sheep, and swine, and distribute them among the several poor husbandmen.&#160; And this we desire thee to do with the advice of the most reverend lord bishop John&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">224</FONT></A>
, and Adrian our <i>chartularius</i> and <i>rector</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">225</FONT></A>
.&#160; If, moreover, it should be necessary for the sake of consultation, our son also the lord Julian should be called in, so that no one else may know, but all be kept quite secret.&#160; Do you therefore consult among yourselves whether this same assistance should be given to the said poor husbandmen in money or in kind.&#160; But, whatever be the common fund, first, as I have said, make a list, and afterwards take pains to distribute to each according to the degree of his poverty.&#160; For I, as the teacher of the Gentiles testifies, have all and abound; nor do I seek money, but reward (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#000">Phil. iv</a><a name="ii.ix.xiv-p11.1"></A>.).&#160; So act therefore that in the day of judgment thou mayest shew me fruit of thy labour from the service that has been committed to thy Experience.&#160; If thou do this purely, faithfully, and strenuously, thou wilt both receive it back here in thy children, and hereafter wilt have plenary retribution in the scrutiny of the Eternal Judge.</p>
