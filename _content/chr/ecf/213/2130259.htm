<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p2"></A>(<span class="sc"><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p2.1"></A>Resp</span>.&#8212;<i>Blessed is He Who went down and was baptized in Jordan, and turned back the People from error!</i>)</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p3"></A>1.&#160; In Baptism Adam found <i>again</i>&#8212;that glory that <i>was</i> among the trees <i>of Eden</i>.&#8212;He went down, and received it out of the water;&#8212;he put it on, and went up and was adorned therein.&#8212;Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p4"></A>2.&#160; Man fell in the midst of Paradise,&#8212;and in baptism compassion restored him:&#8212;he lost his comeliness through <i>Satan&#146;s</i> envy,&#8212;and found it <i>again</i> by <i>God&#146;s</i> grace.&#8212;Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p5"></A>3.&#160; The wedded pair were adorned in Eden;&#8212;but the serpent stole their crowns:&#8212;yet mercy crushed down the accursed one,&#8212;and made the wedded pair goodly in their raiment.&#8212;Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p6"></A>4.&#160; They clothed themselves with leaves of necessity;&#8212;but the Merciful had pity on their beauty,&#8212;and instead of leaves of trees,&#8212;He clothed them with glory in the water.&#8212;Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p7"></A>5.&#160; Baptism is the well-spring of life,&#8212;which the Son of God opened by His Life;&#8212;and from His Side it has brought forth streams.&#8212;Come, all that thirst, come, rejoice!&#8212;Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p8"></A>6.&#160; The Father has sealed <i>Baptism</i>, to exalt it;&#8212;and the Son has espoused it to glorify it;&#8212;and the Spirit with threefold seal&#8212;has stamped it, and it has shone in holiness.&#8212;Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p9"></A>7.&#160; The Trinity that is unsearchable&#8212;has laid up treasures in baptism.&#8212;Descend, ye poor, to its fountain!&#8212;and be enriched from it, ye needy!&#8212;Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</p>
