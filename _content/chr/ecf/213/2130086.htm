<p class="c18"><a name="ii.vii.iv-p2"></A><i>To Januarius, Bishop of Caralis (Cagliari</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">133</FONT></A>

<p class="c23"><a name="ii.vii.iv-p4"></A>Gregory to Januarius, &amp;c.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vii.iv-p5"></A>Know ye that your Fraternity&#146;s solicitude has pleased us, in that you have evinced, as was right, pastoral vigilance for the guardianship of souls.&#160; For indeed it has been reported to us that you have forbidden a monastery to be founded in the house of the late Epiphanius, a reader of your Church, in accordance with his will, for this reason; lest, seeing that this house was adjacent to a monastery of hand-maidens of God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">134</FONT></A>
, deception of souls should thence ensue.&#160; And we praised you greatly for guarding, as became you, by suitable foresight against the snares of the ancient foe.&#160; But, since we have been informed that the religious lady Pompeiana is desirous of taking away the handmaidens of God from this same monastery, and restoring them to their own monasteries whence they had been taken, and establishing there a congregation of monks, it is necessary that if this be accomplished, the disposition of the deceased should in all respects be adhered to.&#160; But, if this should not be done, that the will of the testator may not seem to be entirely frustrated, we will that&#8212;inasmuch as the monastery of the late abbot Urban, situated outside the city of Caralis, is said to be left so destitute that not even one monk remains there&#8212;we will, I say, that John, whom the said Epiphanius appointed to be abbot in the monastery which, as has been said, he had determined should be founded in his house, be ordained abbot (<i>i.e. of the late Urban&#146;s monastery</i>), provided only that there be no impediment against him.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vii.iv-p7"></A>And let the relics which were to have been deposited in the house of the aforesaid Epi<A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A> <a name="ii.vii.iv-Page_55"></A>phanius be deposited there, and let whatever the same Epiphanius had contributed for the intended monastery in his own house be in all ways applied to the other; that so, even though for safeguard, as above written, his will is not carried out with regard to the place, the benefit intended may nevertheless be preserved inviolate.&#160; And indeed let your Fraternity, together with the guardian (<i>defensore</i>) Vitalis, arrange all this, and endeavour to order it so advantageously that you may have your reward, as for your praiseworthy prohibition, so also for your good settlement of the case.&#160; Lastly, though it may be superfluous to commend this monastery to your Fraternity, yet we abundantly exhort you that, as becomes you, with due regard to justice, you hold it as commended to you&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">135</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ii.vii.iv-p8"></A> For further reference to the subject of this letter, see XIV. 2.&#160; It appears there that Epiphanius, mentioned in this letter, had been a son-in-law of Pompeiana.&#160; It appears further that this lady afterwards accused both the bishop Januarius and the <i>defensor</i> Vitalis of having unjustly withheld her son-in-law&#146;s pious bequest, notwithstanding the admonition contained in this letter.</p>
