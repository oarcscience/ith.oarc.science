<p class="c16"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p1.1"></A>Hymn XVII.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p2"></A>(<span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p2.1"></A>Resp</span>., <i>Praise to Thee from every mouth on this Day of Thy Birth!</i>)</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p3"></A>1.&#160; Infants were slain because of Thy Birth, Thou Giver of life to all&#8212;But because He Who was slain was a King, our Lord the Lord of Kingdoms,&#8212;the tyrant in subtlety, gave for Him slain hostages,&#8212;clad in the mysteries of His slaying:&#160; the ranks of heaven received,&#8212;the hostages that they of earth offered.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p4"></A>R., Blessed be the King who magnified Him!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p5"></A>2.&#160; All the Kings of the house of David, transmitted and hauled on each to each,&#8212;the throne and crown of the Son of David, as guardian of a deposit.&#8212;In one they reached their bound and limit, when He came, the Lord of all things,&#8212;and took away from them all things, and cut off the transmission of all things.&#8230;</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p6"></A>R., Blessed be He Who is clad in that which is His!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p7"></A>3.&#160; The doves moaned in Bethlehem, that the serpent destroyed their offspring.&#8212;The eagle betook himself to Egypt, to go down and receive the promises.&#8212;Egypt rejoiced in Him that there came, abundance for payment of debts,&#8212;which had failed the sons of Joseph.&#160; Among the sons of Joseph He laboured and paid&#8212;the debts of the sons of Joseph.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p8"></A>R., Blessed is He Who called Him out of Egypt!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p9"></A>4.&#160; The Scribes read daily, that the Star arises out of Jacob.&#8212;For the People <i>were</i> the Voice and the reading, for the nations the rising <i>of the Star</i> and the interpretation:&#8212;for them were the Books and for us the facts; for them boughs and for us fruits.&#8212;The Scribes read in things written; the Magi saw in things done, the outshining of that which was read.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p10"></A>R., Blessed be He Who added to us their books!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p11"></A>5.&#160; Who is able to tell, of the withdrawal and the appearings,&#8212;of the shining star that went, before the bearers of the offerings?&#8212;It appeared and proclaimed the crown; it was hid and concealed <i>His</i> Body.&#8212;It was for the Son in twofold wise, herald and guardian;&#8212;it guarded His Body, it proclaimed His Crown.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p12"></A>R., Blessed is He Who has given wisdom to them that proclaim Him!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p13"></A>6.&#160; The tyrant gazed on the Magi, as they asked &#8220;Where is the son of the King?&#8221;&#8212;While his heart was gloomy, he sought for himself a cheerful countenance.&#8212;With the sheep he sent wolves, that should kill the Lamb of God.&#8212;The Lamb went down to Egypt, that thence He might judge them,&#8212;whence He had saved them.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p14"></A>R., Blessed be He Who yet again subdued them.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p15"></A>7.&#160; The Magi declared to the tyrant, &#8220;When thy servants joined us,&#8212;the bright star withdrew itself, yea the paths hid themselves.&#8221;&#8212;The blessed ones knew not, that the king had sent bitter <i>foes</i>,&#8212;murderers as <i>if</i> worshippers, to destroy the sweet fruit,&#8212;whereof the bitter eat and are made sweet.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p16"></A>R., To Thee be glory, Medicine of life!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p17"></A>8.&#160; When there the Magi received, commandment to go and seek Him.&#8212;it is written of them that they saw, that bright star and rejoiced.&#8212;<i>Thus</i> it is known that it had been withdrawn; therefore rejoiced they at its aspect.&#8212;It was hid and hindered the murderers, it arose and called the worshippers;&#8212;it overthrew a part and it called a part.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p18"></A>R., Blessed be He Who has triumphed in both parts!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p19"></A>9.&#160; The abhorred one who slew the children, how did he overlook the Child?&#8212;Justice <A NAME="page_258"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 258</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.xviii-Page_258"></A>hindered him that he thought, the Magi would return to him.&#8212;While he stayed waiting to seize, the Worshipped and His worshippers,&#8212;everything escaped his hands, the offerings and the worshippers took flight,&#8212;from the tyrant to the Son of the King.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p20"></A>R., Glory to Him who knows all counsels!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p21"></A>10.&#160; The blameless Magi as they slept, meditated on their beds:&#8212;sleep became a mirror, and a dream rose <i>on it</i> as light.&#8212;The murderer they saw and trembled, as his guile and his sword flashed forth.&#8212;He taught the men guile, he sharpened the sword to sharpness:&#8212;the Watcher taught the sleepers.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p22"></A>R., Blessed is He who gives prudence to the simple!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p23"></A>11.&#160; The simple who believe have known, two Comings of Christ:&#8212;but the foolish scribes have not even perceived one Coming.&#8212;Yet the nations have life in the first, and shall rise again there in the second.&#8212;The People whose mind is blinded, the first Coming has dispersed;&#8212;the second shall blot out their memory.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p24"></A>R., Blessed be the King Who is come and is to come!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p25"></A>12.&#160; When the Saviour arose as the blind, the Sun showed forth his beams,&#8212;and they were clothed in darkness:&#160; the Brightness sent forth his light,&#8212;and He brought the sons of the stars, to make manifest the sons of darkness.&#8212;For lo! among you is the star, but on your eyes the veil.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p26"></A>R., To Thee be glory, newborn Sun!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p27"></A>13.&#160; Prophets declared concerning His Birth, but they made not plain the time thereof.&#8212;He sent the Magi, and they came and showed of its time.&#8212;Yet the Magi who made known the time, made not plain who the Child <i>should be</i>.&#8212;A star of splendid light, in its course showed who the Child was,&#8212;<i>how</i> splendid was <i>His</i> lineage.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p28"></A>R., Blessed be He Who by them all was pointed out!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p29"></A>14.&#160; They scorned the trumpet of Isaiah, which sounded forth His pure Conception,&#8212;they silenced the lute of the Psalms, which sang of His Priesthood;&#8212;the harp of the Spirit they hushed, which sang again of His Kingdom;&#8212;under deep silence they closed up, the great Birth that joined the cry&#8212;of them above with them below.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p30"></A>R., Blessed be He Who appeared in the midst of silence!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p31"></A>15.&#160; His voice was the secret key that opened the mouths of the Magi.&#8212;Whereas preachers were silent in Judah, they made their voice sound through creation;&#8212;and the Gospel which those had scorned, these who came from far took and departed.&#8212;The scorners began to hear their <i>own</i> orders from strangers, who cried out <i>the name of</i> the Son of David.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p32"></A>R., Blessed be He Who by our voice has put them to silence!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p33"></A>16.&#160; Whereas the People scorned offerings, and brought them not to Him the Son of the King,&#8212;He sent His herald to the nations, and caused them to come with their offerings:&#8212;yet not all of them caused He to come, for it could not suffice for them,&#8212;the narrow bosom of Bethlehem; but the bosom of Holy Church,&#8212;enlarged itself and contained her children.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p34"></A>R., Blessed be He Who has made the barren fruitful!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p35"></A>17.&#160; The slayers of Bethlehem mowed down the tender flowers that among them&#8212;should perish the tender seedling, wherein was hidden the Bread of life.&#8212;But the ear of corn that has life had escaped, that it should come to the sheaves in harvest:&#8212;the grape that escaped when young, gave itself to the treading,&#8212;that its wine might give life to souls.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p36"></A>R., Glory to Thee, Treasury of life!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p37"></A>18.&#160; The murderers went into a paradise, full of tender fruits:&#8212;they shook off the flowers from the bough, blossoms and buds they destroyed,&#8212;unblemished oblations he offered, the persecutor unwittingly.&#8212;To him woe, but to them blessing!&#160; Bethlehem was first to give, virgin fruits to the Holy One.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p38"></A>R., Blessed is He Who receives the first fruits!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p39"></A>19.&#160; The Scribes were silenced in envy, the Pharisees in jealousy.&#8212;Men of stone <A NAME="page_259"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 259</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.xviii-Page_259"></A>cried out and gave praise, who had a heart of stone.&#8212;They applauded in presence of the Stone, the rejected that has become the Head.&#8212;Stones were made flesh by that Stone, and obtained mouths to speak; stones cried out through that Stone.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p40"></A>R., Blessed be Thy Birth that has caused stones to cry out!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p41"></A>20.&#160; The Star that is written in Scripture, the nations beheld from afar,&#8212;that the People might be shamed which is near; O People instructed and puffed up! which by the nations hast been in turn instructed, how and where they saw,&#8212;that vision whereof Balaam spake; a stranger he who spread abroad concerning it,&#8212;strangers they who saw it.</p> 
<p class="c51"><a name="iii.v.xviii-p42"></A>R., Blessed is He Who has provoked to jealousy them of His own house!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p43"></A>21.&#160; Let my supplication draw nigh to Thy Door, yea my poverty to Thy Treasury!&#8212;Give to me my Lord without measure, as God unto man!&#8212;And though Thou increase gifts as Son of the Blessed, and though Thou add to them as Son of the King;&#8212;though I be thankless as <i>are all</i> creatures of dust, as Adam <i>so is</i> the son of Adam,&#8212;and as the Blessed <i>so</i> too <i>is</i> the Son of the Blessed.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xviii-p44"></A><i>R., Praise be to Thee Who art like unto Thy Father!</i></p>
