<p class="c16"><a name="iii.vi.vii-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.vi.vii-p1.1"></A>Hymn VI.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.vii-p2"></A>(<span class="sc"><a name="iii.vi.vii-p2.1"></A>Resp</span>.&#8212;<i>Blessed be He Who was baptized that He might baptize you, that ye should be absolved from your offences.</i>)</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.vii-p3"></A>1.&#160; The Spirit came down from on high,&#8212;and hallowed the waters by His brooding.&#8212;In the baptism of John,&#8212;<i>He</i> passed by the rest and abode on One:&#8212;but now He has descended and abode,&#8212;on all that are born of the water.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p4"></A>2.&#160; Out of all that John baptized,&#8212;on One it was that the Spirit dwelt:&#8212;but now He has flown and come down,&#8212;that He may dwell on the many;&#8212;and as each after each comes up,&#8212;He loves him and abides on him.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p5"></A>3.&#160; A marvel <i>it</i> is that surpasses all!&#8212;To the water He went down and was baptized.&#8212;The seas declared it blessed,&#8212;that river wherein Thou wast baptized:&#8212;even the waters that were in heaven envied,&#8212;because they were not worthy to be Thy bath.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p6"></A>4.&#160; A marvel <i>it</i> is, O my Lord, now also,&#8212;that while the fountains are full of water,&#8212;it is the water of baptism,&#8212;that alone is able to atone.&#8212;Mighty is the water in the seas,&#8212;yet is it too weak for atonement.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p7"></A>5.&#160; Thy might, O my Lord, if it abides,&#8212;within the humble it exalts him;&#8212;like as royalty if it abide&#8212;within the desert gives it peace.&#8212;Water by Thy might has triumphed&#8212;over sin, for Life has encompassed it.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p8"></A>6.&#160; The sheep exulted when they saw&#8212;the hand draw nigh to baptize them.&#8212;Receive, O ye sheep, your sealing; enter and be mingled in the flock!&#8212;for more than over all the flock,&#8212;over you rejoice the Watchers to-day.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p9"></A>7.&#160; The Angels and the Watchers rejoice&#8212;over that which is born of the Spirit and of water:&#8212;they rejoice that <i>by</i> fire and <i>by</i> the Spirit,&#8212;the corporeal have become spiritual.&#8212;The Seraphins who sing &#8220;Holy&#8221; rejoice,&#8212;that they who are made holy have been increased.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p10"></A>8.&#160; For lo! the Angels rejoice&#8212;over one sinner if he repent:&#8212;how much more do they now rejoice&#8212;that in all churches and congregations,&#8212;lo! Baptism is bringing forth&#8212;the heavenly from the earthly!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p11"></A>9.&#160; The baptized when they come up are sanctified;&#8212;the sealed when they go down are pardoned.&#8212;They who come up have put on glory;&#8212;they who go down <A NAME="page_274"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 274</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vi.vii-Page_274"></A>have cast off sin.&#8212;Adam put off his glory in a moment;&#8212;ye have been clothed with glory in a moment.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p12"></A>10.&#160; A house that is of dust when it has fallen,&#8212;by means of water can be renewed:&#8212;the body of Adam that was of dust,&#8212;which had fallen by water has been renewed.&#8212;Lo! the priests as builders&#8212;afresh renew your bodies.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p13"></A>11.&#160; A great marvel is this of the wool,&#8212;that it can take every dye,&#8212;as the mind <i>takes</i> every discourse.&#8212;By the name of its dye it is called;&#8212;as ye who were&#8212;baptized <i>when</i> &#8220;Hearers,&#8221;&#8212;have gained the name of &#8220;Recipients.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p14"></A>12.&#160; The common waters he sanctified&#8212;<i>even</i> Elisha through the Name that is secret.&#8212;In them washed the leper openly,&#8212;and was cleansed by the Power that is secret:&#8212;the leprosy was done away in the water, as transgressions in Baptism.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p15"></A>13.&#160; To-day, lo! your offences are blotted out,&#8212;and your names are written down.&#8212;The priest blots out in the water;&#8212;and Christ writes down in Heaven.&#8212;By the blotting out and the writing down&#8212;lo! doubled is your rejoicing.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p16"></A>14.&#160; Lo! mercy has dawned to-day;&#8212;and from bound to bound it stretches:&#8212;the sun has sunk and mercy has dawned.&#8212;Justice has drawn in her wrath; Grace has spread forth her love,&#8212;lo! she pardons and quickens freely.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p17"></A>15.&#160; The sheep that beforetime were in <i>the fold</i>&#8212;lo! they hasten forth to greet&#8212;the new lambs that have been added <i>to it</i>.&#8212;<i>They are</i> white <i>and</i> are clad in white;&#8212;within and without white <i>are</i> your bodies as your vestments.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p18"></A>16.&#160; From every mouth &#8220;Blessed <i>are</i> ye,&#8221;&#8212;on every side &#8220;Blessed <i>are</i> ye.&#8221;&#8212;Sin from you is driven out,&#8212;and the Holy Spirit on you is dwelling.&#8212;The Evil One is become sad of countenance;&#8212;the Good <i>God</i> makes glad your countenance.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p19"></A>17.&#160; The gift that ye have received freely,&#8212;cease not from watching over it:&#8212;this pearl if it shall be lost&#8212;cannot again be sought out,&#8212;for it is like to virginity&#8212;which if it be lost is not to be found.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p20"></A>18. May ye from all defilement&#8212;be kept by the power of your white robes!&#8212;and he whose freedom has defiled itself&#8212;may it be able to wash itself clean by his weeping!&#8212;For me who am servant of the community&#8212;may the supplication of the community win pardon!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p21"></A>19.&#160; To the author who has toiled in words,&#8212;be reconciliation in rest!&#8212;to the teacher who has toiled with voice,&#8212;be forgiveness through grace!&#8212;to the priest who has toiled in baptizing,&#8212;let there come the crown of righteousness!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vii-p22"></A>20.&#160; From every mouth with one consent,&#8212;of those beneath and those above,&#8212;Watchers, Cherubin, and Seraphin,&#8212;the baptized, the sealed, and the hearers,&#8212;let each of us cry aloud and say,&#8212;&#8220;Glory to the Lord of our feasts!&#8221;</p>
