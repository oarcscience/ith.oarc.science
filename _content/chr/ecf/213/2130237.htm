<p class="c16"><a name="iii.v.xii-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.v.xii-p1.1"></A>Hymn XI.</span></p> 
<p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.xii-p2"></A>(<span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.xii-p2.1"></A>The Virgin Mother to Her Child</span>.)</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.v.xii-p3"></A>I <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.xii-p3.1"></A>shall</span> not be jealous, my Son, that Thou art with me, and also with all men.&#160; Be Thou God to him that confesses Thee, and be thou Lord to him that serves Thee, and be Brother to him that loves Thee, that Thou mayest gain all!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xii-p4"></A>When Thou didst dwell in me, Thou didst also dwell out of me, and when I brought Thee forth openly, Thy hidden might was not removed from me.&#160; Thou art within me, and Thou art without me, O Thou that makest Thy Mother amazed.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xii-p5"></A>For [when] I see that outward form of Thine before mine eyes, the hidden Form is shadowed forth &#8220;in my mind,&#8221; O holy One.&#160; In Thy visible form I see Adam, and in Thy hidden form I see Thy Father, who is joined with Thee.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xii-p6"></A>Hast Thou then shown me alone Thy Beauty in two Forms?&#160; Let Bread shadow forth Thee, and also the mind; dwell also in Bread and in the eaters thereof.&#160; In secret, and openly too, may Thy Church see Thee, as well as Thy Mother.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xii-p7"></A>He that hates Thy Bread is like unto him that hates Thy Body.&#160; He that is far off that desires Thy Bread, and he that is near that loves Thy Image, are alike.&#160; In the Bread and in the Body, the first and also the last have seen Thee.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xii-p8"></A>Yet Thy visible Bread is far more precious than Thy Body; for Thy Body even unbelievers have seen, but they have not seen Thy living Bread.&#160; They that were far off rejoiced! their portion utterly scorns that of those that are near.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xii-p9"></A>Lo! Thy Image is shadowed forth in the blood of the grapes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_476"></A><A HREF="#fn_476"><FONT SIZE="1">477</FONT></A>
 on the Bread; and it is shadowed forth on the heart with the finger of love, with the colors of faith.&#160; Blessed be He that by the Image of His Truth caused the graven images to pass away.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xii-p11"></A>Thou art not [so] the Son of Man that I should sing unto Thee a common lullaby; for Thy Conception is new, and Thy Birth marvellous.&#160; Without the Spirit who shall sing to Thee?&#160; A new muttering of prophecy is hot within me.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xii-p12"></A>How shall I call Thee a stranger to us, Who art from us?&#160; Should I call Thee Son?&#160; Should I call Thee Brother?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_477"></A><A HREF="#fn_477"><FONT SIZE="1">478</FONT></A>
&#160; Husband should I call Thee?&#160; Lord should I call Thee, O Child that didst give Thy Mother a second birth from the waters?</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xii-p14"></A>For I am Thy sister, of the house of David the father of us Both.&#160; Again, I am Thy Mother because of Thy Conception, and Thy Bride am I because of Thy sanctification, Thy handmaid and Thy daughter, from the Blood and Water wherewith Thou hast purchased me and baptised me.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xii-p15"></A>The Son of the Most High came and dwelt in me, and I became His Mother; and as by a second birth I brought Him forth so did He bring me forth by the second birth, because He put His Mother&#146;s garments on, she clothed her body with His glory.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xii-p16"></A>Tamar, who was of the house of David, Amnon put to shame; and virginity fell and perished from them both.&#160; My pearl is not lost:&#160; in Thy treasury it is stored, because Thou hast put it on.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xii-p17"></A>The scent of her brother-in-law slunk from Tamar, whose perfume she had stolen.&#160; <A NAME="page_246"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 246</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.xii-Page_246"></A>As for Joseph&#146;s Bride, not even his breath exhaled from her garments, since she conceived Cinnamon.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_478"></A><A HREF="#fn_478"><FONT SIZE="1">479</FONT></A>
 &#160;A wall of fire was Thy Conception unto me, O holy Son.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xii-p19"></A>The little flower was faint, because the smell of the Lily&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_479"></A><A HREF="#fn_479"><FONT SIZE="1">480</FONT></A>
 of Glory was great.&#160; The Treasure-house of spices stood in no need of flower or its smells!&#160; Flesh stood aloof because it perceived in the womb a Conception from the Spirit.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xii-p21"></A>The woman ministers before the man, because he is her head.&#160; Joseph rose to minister before his Lord, Who was in Mary.&#160; The priest ministered before Thy ark by reason of Thy holiness.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xii-p22"></A>Moses carried the tables of stone which the Lord wrote, and Joseph bare about the pure Tablet in whom the Son of the Creator was dwelling.&#160; The tables had ceased, because the world was filled with Thy doctrine.</p>
