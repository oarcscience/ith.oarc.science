<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.xii-p2"></A>(<span class="sc"><a name="iii.vi.xii-p2.1"></A>Resp</span>.&#8212;<i>Let the bodies rejoice which the Evil One had made naked, that in the water they have put on their glory!</i>)</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.xii-p3"></A>1.&#160; Give thanks, O daughter, that thy crownings have been doubled;&#8212;for lo! thy temples and thy sons rejoice.&#8212;The dedication of thy temples is in the ministration;&#8212;The dedication of thy sons <i>is</i> in the anointing.&#8212;Blessed art thou that at once&#8230;&#8230;&#8212;&#8230;&#8230;the tabernacle for them that dwell in thee,&#8212;and the Spirit has abode upon thy sons!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xii-p4"></A>2.&#160; Our Lord opened up Baptism&#8212;in the midst of Jordan the blessed river.&#8212;The height and the depth rejoiced in Him;&#8212;He brings forth the first fruits of His peace from the water,&#8212;for they are first fruits, the fruits of Baptism.&#8212;The good <i>God</i> in His compassion will bring to pass&#8212;that His peace shall be first fruits on earth.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xii-p5"></A>3.&#160; Moses stretched out the temporal Tabernacle;&#8212;the priests bathed themselves in water,&#8212;and went in and ministered; and were stricken and punished,&#8212;because their heart within was not cleansed.&#8212;Blessed art thou that in the Passover of the great Passion,&#8212;the priests by the savour of their oblations,&#8212;lo! are cleansing souls in thee!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xii-p6"></A>4.&#160; Great was the mystery that the Prophet saw,&#8212;the torrent that was mighty.&#8212;Into its depths he gazed and beheld&#8212;thy beauty instead of himself; thee it was he saw, for thy faith passes not away,&#8212;thou whose flood unseen shall overwhelm&#8212;the subtleties of idolatry.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xii-p7"></A>5.&#160; Though John was great among them that are born of women,&#8212;yet he that is little is greater than he,&#8212;in this that his baptized were again baptized,&#8212;in the baptism <A NAME="page_282"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 282</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vi.xii-Page_282"></A>that was of the Apostles.&#8212;Blessed <i>art</i> thou that thy priest is greater than he&#8212;in this alone that forever&#8212;abides his baptism.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xii-p8"></A>6.&#160; The baptism that was of Siloam&#8212;did not bring mercy to the man that was laid <i>there</i>&#8212;who for thirty and eight years awaited it,&#8212;for he was a respecter of the persons of the Levites.&#8212;Blessed <i>art</i> thou that thy healing <i>is</i> in thee for all men,&#8212;and thy priests are devoted and ready&#8212;for all that <i>are</i> in need of thy help.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xii-p9"></A>7.&#160; The Prophet healed the waters that were unwholesome,&#8212;and cured the disease of the land that was barren,&#8212;so that its death was done away and its region resounded, for its offspring increased and its bosom was filled.&#8212;Greater is Thy grace, <i>Lord</i>, than Elisha&#146;s!&#8212;Multiply my lambs and my flocks&#8212;at the great stream of my fountain!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_517"></A><A HREF="#fn_517"><FONT SIZE="1">518</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xii-p11"></A>8.&#160; Great is the marvel that is within thy abode;&#8212;the flocks together with the Shepherds,&#8212;those at the stream of the waters,&#8212;two unseen with one manifest who baptizes.&#8212;Blessed <i>is</i> he who is baptized in their fountains!&#8212;for three arms have upheld him,&#8212;and three Names have preserved him!</p>
