<span id="ii.viii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii.viii-p1.1"></span>Epistle L.</span>

<span id="ii.viii.viii-p2"></span>To Eulogius, Patriarch of Alexandria.

<span id="ii.viii.viii-p3"></span>Gregory to Eulogius, &c.

<span id="ii.viii.viii-p4"></span>The bearers of these presents, coming
to Sicily, were converted from the error of the Monophysites, and united
themselves to the holy universal Church.  Having proceeded to the church
of the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles, they requested of me that
I should commend them by letter to your Blessedness, to the end that
they may not now be allowed to suffer any wrong from the heretics that
are near them.  And because one of them says that the monastery in which
he was had been founded by his kindred, he desires to receive authority
from your Holiness that the heretics who are in it may either return to
the bosom of holy Church or be expelled from the same monastery.  Let it
be enough for us to have indicated this to you:  for we know of your
Blessedness that whatever pertains to zeal for Almighty God you hasten
with all fervour to do.  But for me I beg you to pray, since amid the
swords of the Lombards which I endure I am excessively afflicted by
pains of gout.
