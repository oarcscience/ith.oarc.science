<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.vi-p2"></A>(<span class="sc"><a name="iii.vi.vi-p2.1"></A>Resp</span>.&#8212;<i>Blessed be He that ordained baptism, for the atonement of the sons of Adam!</i>)</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.vi-p3"></A>1.&#160; Descend, my brethren, put on from the waters of baptism the Holy Spirit;&#8212;be joined with the spirits that minister to the Godhead!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p4"></A>2.&#160; For lo! He is the fire that secretly, seals also His flock,&#8212;by the Three spiritual Names, wherein the Evil One is put to flight.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p5"></A>3.&#160; John when he cried and said &#8220;This is the Lamb of God,&#8221;&#8212;thereby showed concerning the Gentiles that they are Abraham&#146;s children.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p6"></A>4.&#160; This is he that testified of our Saviour, that with fire and the Spirit He should baptize.&#8212;Lo! the fire and the Spirit, my brethren, in the baptism of truth.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p7"></A>5.&#160; For greater is Baptism than Jordan that little river;&#8212;for that in streams of water and oil, the misdeeds of all men are washed out.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p8"></A>6.&#160; Elisha by seven times <i>washing</i>, cleansed Naaman&#146;s leprosy:&#8212;in Baptism are cleansed the secret misdeeds in the soul.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p9"></A>7.&#160; Moses baptized the People in the midst of the sea, yet availed not&#8212;to wash their heart within, that was full of the defilements of misdeeds.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p10"></A><A NAME="page_273"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 273</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vi.vi-Page_273"></A>8.&#160; Lo! the priest in the likeness of Moses purges the defilements of the soul;&#8212;and with oil of anointing, lo! he seals new lambs for the Kingdom.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p11"></A>9.&#160; Samuel anointed David to be king among the People:&#8212;but lo! the priest anoints you to be heirs in the Kingdom.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p12"></A>10.&#160; For with the armour that David put on, after the anointing he fought&#8212;and laid low the giant who sought to subdue Israel.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p13"></A>11.&#160; Lo! again in the chrism of Christ, and in the armour that is from the water&#8212;the haughtiness of the Evil One is humbled, who sought to subdue the Gentiles.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p14"></A>12.&#160; By the water that flowed from the rock, the thirst of the People was quenched.&#160; Lo! in the fountain of Christ, the thirst of the peoples is quenched.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p15"></A>13.&#160; The rod of Moses opened the rock, and the streams flowed forth; and they were refreshed by its draught, who had grown faint with thirst.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p16"></A>14.&#160; Lo! from the side of Christ flowed the stream that bestowed life.&#8212;The Gentiles drank that were weary, and in it forgot their pains.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p17"></A>15.&#160; With Thy dew besprinkle my vileness, and my crimes in Thy blood shall be atoned!&#8212;And I shall be, O my Lord, at Thy right hand, and with Thy Saints I shall be joined!</p>
