id="ii.vii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XL.</span>

<span id="ii.vii.xiv-p2"></span>To Marinianus, Bishop of Ravenna.

<span id="ii.vii.xiv-p3"></span>Gregory to Marinianus, &c.

<span id="ii.vii.xiv-p4"></span>Great infirmity constrains us, dearest
brother, <span id="page_61">p. 61</span> <span
id="ii.vii.xiv-Page_61"></span>from which if we were free, we should
seem justly blamable.  But since, while we are in this fragile body, we
cannot subsist but by subservience to its weaknesses, we ought not to
blush for what necessity imposes on us.  And so, since physicians all
say that to those who suffer from eruption of blood fasts are injurious,
we exhort thy Fraternity by this present address that, recalling to mind
what thou hast been accustomed to endure from sickness, thou by no means
impose on thyself the labour of fasting <span
id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148) .  If, however, by the mercy of God,
thou knowest thyself to be so far improved in health as to have
sufficient strength, we permit thee to fast once or twice in the week. 
But of this it befits thee before all things to take care, that thou in
no wise subject thyself to any feeling of irritation, lest the sickness,
which is believed to be now lighter and as it were suspended, should be
experienced afterwards more heavily through exasperation.
