<p class="c16"><a name="iii.vi.xi-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.vi.xi-p1.1"></A>Hymn X.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.xi-p2"></A>(<span class="sc"><a name="iii.vi.xi-p2.1"></A>Resp</span>.&#8212;<i>Glory to Him Who came and restored it!</i>)</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.xi-p3"></A>1.&#160; Adam sinned and earned all sorrows;&#8212;likewise the world after His example, all guilt.&#8212;And instead of considering how it should be restored,&#8212;<i>considered</i> how its fall should be pleasant for it.&#8212;Glory to Him Who came and restored it!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xi-p4"></A>2.&#160; This cause summoned Him that is pure,&#8212;that He should come and be baptized, even He with the defiled,&#8212;Heaven for His glory was rent asunder.&#8212;That the purifier of all might be baptized with all,&#8212;He came down and sanctified the water for our baptism.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xi-p5"></A>3.&#160; For that cause for which He entered into the womb,&#8212;for the same cause He went down into the river.&#8212;For that cause for which He entered into the grave,&#8212;for the same cause He makes <i>us</i> enter into His chamber.&#8212;He perfected mankind for every cause.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xi-p6"></A>4.&#160; His Conception is the store of our blessings;&#8212;His Birth is the treasury of our joys;&#8212;His Baptism is the cause of our pardon;&#8212;His Death is the cause of our life.&#8212;Death He alone has overcome in His Resurrection.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xi-p7"></A>5.&#160; At His Birth a star of light shone in the air;&#8212;when He was baptized light flashed from the water;&#8212;at His Death the sun was darkened in the firmament;&#8212;at His Passion the luminaries set along with Him;&#8212;at His Epiphany the luminaries arose with Him.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xi-p8"></A>6.&#160; Revealed was His Glory because of His Majesty;&#8212;revealed was His Passion because of His Manhood;&#8212;revealed was His Love because of His Graciousness;&#8212;revealed was His Judgment because of His Justice.&#8212;He has poured forth His attributes, on them that were His.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xi-p9"></A>7.&#160; That whoso has looked on His Glory and despised Him,&#8212;may look again on His Glory and worship Him;&#8212;and whoso has scorned to taste of His Graciousness,&#8212;may fear lest he be made to feel His justice;&#8212;He has poured forth His helps on His worshippers.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xi-p10"></A>8.&#160; Lo! the East in the morning was made light!&#8212;lo! the South at noonday was made dark!&#8212;The West again in turn at eventide was made light.&#8212;The three quarters represent the one Birth;&#8212;His Death and His Life they declare.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xi-p11"></A>9.&#160; His Birth flowed on and was joined to His Baptism;&#8212;and His Baptism again flowed on even to His Death;&#8212;His Death led and reached to His Resurrection,&#8212;a fourfold bridge unto His Kingdom; and lo! His sheep pass over in His footsteps.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xi-p12"></A>10.&#160; And like as, save by the door of birth,&#8212;none can enter into creation;&#8212;so, save <A NAME="page_281"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 281</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vi.xi-Page_281"></A>by the door of resurrection,&#8212;none can enter into the Kingdom,&#8212;and whoso has cut off his bridge, has brought to nought his hope.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xi-p13"></A>11.&#160; He put on His armour and conquered and was crowned;&#8212;He left His armour on earth and ascended,&#8212;that if any man desires the crown,&#8212;he may resort to the armour and win by it&#8212;the crown of victory which he yearns after.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xi-p14"></A>12.&#160; He fulfilled righteousness on earth, and ascended.&#8212;But if He, the All-cleanser, was baptized,&#8212;What man is there that shall not be baptized?&#8212;for grace has come to baptism&#8212;to wash away the foulness of our wound.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xi-p15"></A>13.&#160; The compulsion of God is an all-prevailing force;&#8212;[but that is not pleasing to Him which is of compulsion,]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_516"></A><A HREF="#fn_516"><FONT SIZE="1">517</FONT></A>
&#8212;as that which <i>is</i> of discerning will.&#8212;Therefore in our fruits He calls us&#8212;who live not <i>as</i> under compulsion, by persuasion.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xi-p17"></A>14.&#160; Good is He, for lo! He labours in these two things;&#8212;He wills not to constrain our freedom&#8212;nor again does He suffer us to abuse it.&#8212;For had he constrained it, He had taken away its power;&#8212;and had He let it go, He had deprived it of help.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xi-p18"></A>15.&#160; He knows that if He constrains He deprives us;&#8212;He knows that if He casts off He destroys us;&#8212;He knows that if He teaches He wins us.&#8212;He has not constrained and He has not cast off, as the Evil One <i>does</i>:&#8212;He has taught, chastened, and won us, as being the good <i>God</i>.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xi-p19"></A>16.&#160; He knows that His treasuries abound:&#8212;the keys of His treasuries He has put into our hands.&#8212;He has made the Cross our treasurer&#8212;to open for us the gates of Paradise,&#8212;as Adam opened the gate of Gehenna.</p>
