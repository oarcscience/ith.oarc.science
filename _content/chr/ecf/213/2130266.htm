<p class="c16"><a name="iii.vii.iii-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.vii.iii-p1.1"></A>Hymn II.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vii.iii-p2"></A>1.&#160; Whereunto art thou like?&#160; Let thy stillness speak to one that hears; with silent mouth speak with us:&#160; for whoso hears the stammerings of thy silence, to him thy type utters its silent cry concerning our Redeemer.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p3"></A>Thy mother is a virgin of the sea; though he took her not [to wife]:&#160; she fell into his bosom, though he knew her not; she conceived thee near him, though he did not know her.&#160; Do thou, that art a type, reproach the Jewish women that have thee hung upon them.&#160; Thou art the only progeny of all forms which art like to the Word on High, Whom singly the Most High begot.&#160; The engraven forms seem to be the type of created things above.&#160; This visible offspring of the invisible womb is a type of great things.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_521"></A><A HREF="#fn_521"><FONT SIZE="1">522</FONT></A>
&#160; Thy goodly conception was without seed, and without wedlock was thy pure generation, and without brethren was thy single birth.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p5"></A>Our Lord had brethren and yet not brethren, since He was an Only-Begotten.&#160; O solitary one, thou type exact of the Only-Begotten!&#160; There is a type of thine in the crown of kings, [wherein] thou hast brothers and sisters.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p6"></A>Goodly gems are thy brethren, with beryls and unions as thy companions:&#160; may gold be as it were thy kinsman, may there be unto the King of kings a crown from thy well-beloved ones!&#160; When thou camest up from the sea, that living tomb, thou didst cry out.&#160; Let me have a goodly assemblage of brethren, relatives, and kinsmen.&#160; As the wheat is in the stalk, so thou art in the crown with princes:&#160; and it is a just restoration to thee, as if of a pledge,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_522"></A><A HREF="#fn_522"><FONT SIZE="1">523</FONT></A>
 that from that depth thou shouldest be exalted to a goodly eminence.&#160; Wheat the stalk bears in the field; thee the head of the king upon his chariot carries about.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p8"></A>O daughter of the water, who hast left sea, wherein thou wert born, and art gone up to the dry land, wherein thou art beloved:&#160; for men have loved and seized and adorned themselves with thee, like as they did that Offspring Whom the Gentiles loved and crowned themselves withal.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p9"></A>It is by the mystery of truth that Leviathan is trodden down of mortals:&#160; the divers put him off, and put on Christ.&#160; In the sacrament of oil did the Apostles&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_523"></A><A HREF="#fn_523"><FONT SIZE="1">524</FONT></A>
 steal Thee away, and came up.&#160; They snatched their souls from his mouth, bitter as it was.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p11"></A><A NAME="page_295"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 295</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vii.iii-Page_295"></A>Thy Nature is like a silent lamb in its sweetness, of which if a man is to lay hold, he lifts it in a crucial form by its ears, as it was on Golgotha.&#160; He cast out abundantly all His gleams upon them that looked upon Him.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p12"></A>2.&#160; Shadowed forth in thy beauty is the beauty of the Son, Who clothed Himself with suffering when the nails passed through Him.&#160; The awl passed in thee since they handled thee roughly, as they did His hands; and because He suffered He reigned, as by thy sufferings thy beauty increased.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p13"></A>And if they showed no pity upon thee, neither did they love thee:&#160; still suffer as thou mightest, thou hast come to reign!&#160; Simon Peter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_524"></A><A HREF="#fn_524"><FONT SIZE="1">525</FONT></A>
 showed pity on the Rock; whoso hath smitten it, is himself thereby overcome; it is by reason of Its suffering that Its beauty hath adorned the height and the depth.</p>
