<p><a name="ii.vii.xxxv-p4"></A>Since it is written, <i>Righteousness exalteth a nation; but sin maketh peoples miserable</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#034">Prov. xiv. 34</a><a name="ii.vii.xxxv-p4.1"></A>), a kingdom is then believed to be stable when a fault that is known of is quickly amended.&#160; Now it has come to our ears by the report of many, what we cannot mention without exceeding affliction of heart, that certain priests in those parts live so immodestly and wickedly that it is a shame for us to hear of it and lamentable to tell it.&#160; Lest, then, now that the rumour of this iniquity has extended as far as here, the wrong doing of others should smite either our soul or your kingdom with the dart of its sin, we ought to arise with ardour to avenge these things, lest the wickedness of a few should be the perdition of many.&#160; For bad priests are the cause of the ruin of a people.&#160; For who may offer himself as an intercessor for a people&#146;s sins, if the priest who ought to have prayed for it commits more grievous offences?&#160; But, since those whose place it is to prosecute these things are stirred neither by care to enquire into them nor by zeal to punish them, let letters from you be addressed to us, and let us send over, if you order it, a person with the assent of your authority, who together with other priests may search into these things thoroughly, and amend them according to the will of God.&#160; For indeed what we speak of is not a thing to be winked at, since one who can amend a fault and neglects to do so without doubt makes himself partaker in it.&#160; See therefore to your own soul, see to your grandsons, whom you wish to reign happily, see to the provinces; and, before our Creator stretches out His hand to smite, take most earnest thought for the correction of this wickedness, lest He afterwards smite by so much the more sharply as He now waits longer and more mercifully.&#160; Know moreover that you will offer a great sacrifice of expiation to our God, if you cut off speedily from your territories the infection of so great a sin.</p>
