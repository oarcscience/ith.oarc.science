<p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.lix-p2"></A><i>To Maximus, Bishop of Salona</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">87</FONT></A>
.</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="ii.v.lix-p4"></A>Gregory to Maximus, &amp;c.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.v.lix-p5"></A>Having received the letters of our brother and fellow-bishop Marinianus, and Castorius, our <i>chartularius</i>, having also returned, we learn that your Fraternity have made most full satisfaction with regard to the matters about which there had been uncertainty; and we return great thanks to Almighty God that from our inmost heart all rancour of sinister suspicion <A NAME="page_38"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 38</FONT></A> <a name="ii.v.lix-Page_38"></A>has been eradicated.&#160; On this account I have been desirous of dismissing with the utmost speed our common son, your deacon Stephen.&#160; But the frequent pains of my sicknesses have compelled me to retain him with me for a few days.&#160; As soon, however, as I have begun to be even slightly better, I have provided for sending him forthwith back to you with joy.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.v.lix-p6"></A>Accordingly we send to you, according to custom, the pallium for the sacred solemnities of mass; the meaning of which we desire you in all respects to vindicate.&#160; For the dignity of this vestment is humility and justice.&#160; Let, then, your Fraternity make haste with all your heart to shew yourself humble in prosperity, and in adversity, if ever it should ensue; upright in justice; friendly to the good, and opposed to the froward; never discountenancing any one who speaks for the truth; instant in works of mercy according to thy means, and yet beyond thy means desiring to be instant; sympathizing with the weak; rejoicing with men of good will; regarding the woes of others as thine own; exulting for the joys of others as if for thine own; in correcting vices severe, in cherishing virtues, soothing the minds of hearers; in anger, retaining judgment without anger, but in calmness not relinquishing the censorship of your severity.&#160; This, dearest brother, is the meaning of the pallium which you will receive, which if you act up to, you will have inwardly what you are seen to have received outwardly.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.v.lix-p7"></A>Furthermore I commend in all respects to your Fraternity our brother and fellow-bishop Sabinianus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">88</FONT></A>
; and if there be any matters of dispute between you, let them meanwhile be laid aside.&#160; Let charity remain fixed between you, that so, in case of contention ever arising about external things, they may be examined without charity deserting the heart.&#160; We commend also our common son Honoratus:&#160; concerning whom if it is the case, as we have learnt through Castorius our <i>chartularius</i>; that through him three previous archdeacons have been compelled to observe the ecclesiastical custom by retiring at the expiration of five years, we desire indeed that he may experience the charity of thy Holiness.&#160; For a judgment ought not to be solicited in a case which he himself has judged.&#160; If, however, it is not so, then, all swelling of heart being repressed, and all grudge set aside, he ought to be received, and by no means removed from the place which he now occupies.&#160; Messianus also, the <i>cleric</i> who had taken refuge with us, we have confidently committed to the charge of our common son Stephen the deacon, being assured that in the case of one whom we ourselves send to your Fraternity, you will not show any grudge, but lend the countenance of your authority.&#160; May Almighty God keep you in His protection, and grant us so to act that after the billows of this temporal state we may be able to attain with joy to things eternal.</p>
