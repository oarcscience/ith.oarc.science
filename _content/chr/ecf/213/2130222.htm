<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xlvi-p2"></A>1. Hold your peace, O mortals (said Death), a little while:&#160; and be like me who am so silent, in the midst of Sheol.&#8212;2. <i>R., To Thee be glory, Watcher, that didst come down, after them that slept:&#160; and utter the voice from the Tree, and waken them!</i>&#8212;3. Ye are grieving, yea, weeping, for him that has gone:&#160; as though he came to grind for me, the mill in Sheol.&#8212;4. Great is the peace I give, unto the wearied:&#160; I wax not weary as you, nor weary them.&#8212;5. I hear all manner of curses, from thankless men:&#160; the sons of Adam are like Adam, who was thankless to his Lord.&#8212;6. Contrary one to the other are <i>your</i> voices, and your doings:&#160; with your voices ye weep and in your doings, ye fight daily.&#8212;7. I heard weeping and I thought to myself, that none labours:&#160; I saw toiling and I thought to myself, that no man dies.&#8212;8. The struggles of man made me think, that he is not mortal:&#160; his great weeping made me think, that to-morrow he is not.&#8212;9. Hear and let me be your counsellor, if ye be willing:&#160; for these two, these burdens, are very bitter.&#8212;10. Cease a little while from this toil, and from <i>this</i> weeping:&#160; toil ye and weep as mortals, who to-morrow vanish.&#8212;11. Ye are frantic with weeping, for your departed:&#160; and ye struggle in toiling, for your possessions.&#8212;12. It is well with the infants that die, and blessed are they:&#160; for they are freed from the misery, whereunto ye are cast.&#8212;13. Suffer me to go to Sheol, and there to say:&#160; &#8220;Happy are ye silent dead, how tranquil are ye!&#8221;&#8212;14. Hear the conclusion of our own words, If there be a resurrection:&#160; weep not ye, neither labour as though strangers.&#8212;15. Ye straggle as one who was to live, here forever:&#160; and ye weep as one who never, should rise again.&#8212;16. Hear my words, if there be with you <A NAME="page_218"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 218</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.xlvi-Page_218"></A>place for hearing:&#160; and prepare you provision that when I call ye may answer.&#8212;17. For I hearken even I, to Him that calls me:&#160; and will restore your bodies, with your treasures.&#8212;18. Let there be peace between us, until that day:&#160; and when ye come forth I will cry and say, &#8220;Depart in peace!&#8221;&#8212;19. Come ye, you and I even now, shall give glory:&#160; to Him that brings to death and to life, that He may give aid.&#8212;20. Praise from us all be to thee, O Lord, the living Sacrifice! Who by the sacrifice of Thy Body hast given life to quick and dead.&#8212;21. Praise to Him Who clothed Himself in our body, and died and rose again:&#160; He died in us and we live in Him, blessed be He Who sent Him!</p>
