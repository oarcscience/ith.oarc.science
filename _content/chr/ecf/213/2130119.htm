<p class="c22"><a name="ii.vii.xxxvii-p2"></A>To Boniface, Guardian (Defensorem), in Corsica.</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="ii.vii.xxxvii-p3"></A>Gregory to Boniface, &amp;c.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vii.xxxvii-p4"></A>Thy experience is not free from blame, in that, knowing Aleria and Adjacium, cities of Corsica, to have been long without bishops, thou hast delayed admonishing their clergy and people to choose for themselves priests.&#160; But, since they ought to be no longer without rulers of their own, hasten thou, on receiving this authority, to exhort the clergy and people of these cities severally, that they disagree not among themselves, but that each city with one consent choose for itself a priest to be consecrated.&#160; And, when they have made their decree, let such person as shall have been elected come to us.&#160; But, if they should be unwilling to come to an unanimous decision, being divided in their choice between two persons, let both in like manner come to us, the decree having been made in the usual way, that, after enquiry made into their lives and characters, the one who may appear to be most fit may be ordained.&#160; Seeing, moreover, that many poor persons there are said to be oppressed and to suffer prejudice, let thy Experience give heed to this, and not allow them to be unjustly aggrieved; but so endeavour thyself that neither they who take action be unreasonably hindered nor those against whom action is taken be in danger of sustaining damage unjustly.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vii.xxxvii-p5"></A>Furthermore, it has reached our ears that some of the clergy, thou being on the spot, are held in custody by laymen.&#160; If this is so, know that the blame will be imputed to thee, since, if thou wert a man, it would not have been the case.&#160; And accordingly thou must needs pay attention in future so that thou permit not the like to be done; but that, if any one should have a cause of complaint against a clerk, he resort to his bishop.&#160; And, if perchance the latter should be suspected, a commissioner must be deputed by him&#8212;or, if this too should be objected to by the plaintiff, by thy Experience,&#8212;who may compel the parties to choose arbitrators by mutual consent.&#160; And whatever may be decided by them, let it <A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A> <a name="ii.vii.xxxvii-Page_86"></A>be in all ways so carried out, with due observance of law, by thy own or the bishop&#146;s care, that there may be no occasion for them to weary themselves with disputes.</p>
