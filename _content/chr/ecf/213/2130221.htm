<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xlv-p2"></A>1. <i>Man</i>, O Death, despise thou it not, that image of Adam:&#160; which like a seed is committed to earth, till the Resurrection.&#8212;2. <i>R., To thee be glory Who didst descend and plunge, after Adam:&#160; and draw him out from the depths of Sheol, and bring him into Eden!</i>&#8212;3. <i>Death</i>, I marvel at this seed, and at your words:&#160; for lo! after five thousand years, it springs not yet.&#8212;4. <i>M.</i>, Its present state passes away, as winter <i>does</i>:&#160; and as a handful of <i>corn</i> it comes in the resurrection, to the garner of life.&#8212;5. <i>D</i>., That there is vintage-time, lo! I know, but I have not seen:&#160; the dead at any time sown, or yet reaped.&#8212;6. <i>M</i>., There is coming a reaping, <A NAME="page_217"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 217</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.xlv-Page_217"></A>O Death, that will leave thee bare:&#160; and the Watchers shall go forth as reapers, and make thee desolate.&#8212;7. <i>D</i>., When did I become husbandman, instead of vine-dresser? who has turned Sheol the wine-press, into a tilled field?&#8212;8. <i>M</i>., Does not the seed then teach thee, which decays and dies:&#160; and <i>is</i> cut off from hope, yet from the rain, recovers hope?&#8212;9. <i>D</i>., A dream have ye seen ye feeble ones, of life from the dead:&#160; for in waking time the resurrection, ye do not see.&#8212;10. <i>M</i>., Thy drowsiness hinders thee, that thou seest not:&#160; the multitudes of mysteries which cry aloud, of the resurrection.&#8212;11. <i>D</i>., I know that seeds come to life, but I have not seen:&#160; bones that grew in Sheol, and sprang and came up.&#8212;12. <i>M</i>., All thy discourse is like thyself, for lo! Ezekiel:&#160; has taught thee how in the valley, the dead come to life.&#8212;13. <i>D</i>., Trees have I seen how in summer, they put on their garments:&#160; but bones in their nakedness, are cast into Sheol.&#8212;14. <i>M</i>., Moses broke by his splendour, thy heart, O Death:&#160; the son of Adam has regained and put on, the glory of Adam.&#8212;15. <i>D.</i>, Our law in Sheol is this, to keep silence:&#160; for you are words and for me deeds, O feeble ones.&#8212;16. <i>M</i>., How are the aged passed over if thou be vinedresser?&#160; He Who hindered thee from <i>taking</i> their lives, the same quickens all.&#8212;17. The babe in the womb confutes thee, which is <i>as</i> buried there:&#160; to me it proclaims life from the dead, but to thee despoiling.&#8212;18. The despised flower despises thee, for it is shut up and passed over:&#160; yet though lost it is not lost, but blossoms again.&#8212;19. The chick cries out from the egg, wherein it is buried:&#160; and the graves are rent by a Voice, and the body arises.&#8212;20. For a body too is the chick, that is in the egg:&#160; lo! its body to our body proclaims, the life from the dead.&#8212;21. With the locust thy plea is overthrown, and ended, O Death:&#160; for in coming forth from the dust it teaches, the life from the dead.&#8212;22. <i>D.</i>, I had been content if already, the resurrection had been:&#160; for the day of resurrection had disturbed me less, than your judgments.&#8212;23. Merciful is the Son of the Highest, yea good and just:&#160; and will not harshly avenge on me, the death of Adam.&#8212;24. Have ye then no understanding, to perceive this:&#160; that your father laid on you, this retribution?</p>
