<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.x-p2"></A>&#8230;My afflictions are as Job&#146;s.&#160; Thy justice delivered him; let Thy grace have mercy on me!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p3"></A>2.&#160; In these two things is profit; that neither should the just, be weary in supplication, nor should the rebellious, multiply transgression.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p4"></A>3.&#160; With the sons Thou labourest, to chastise and help <i>them</i>; and that the fathers should not be grieved, by the sound of the scourge, they left me in peace.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p5"></A>4.&#160; Look, O my Lord, on my woods without, how they have been cut down! behold, O my Lord, my breasts within, that they are <i>too</i> weak, for me to bear my beloved ones!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p6"></A>5.&#160; With swords they have cut off, my wings that are without; again the fire kindles, in my bosom within, the incense of burnt offering.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p7"></A>6.&#160; The sun-worshippers have killed, my sons in the plain:&#160; and they that offer to Baal, have sacrificed my bulls in the city, my sheep with my babes.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p8"></A>7.&#160; In my fields is lamentation; in my halls wailing; in my vineyards terror; in my streets confusion.&#160; Who can suffice for me?</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p9"></A>8.&#160; The Evil One who dealt treacherously, and disturbed me with his words, stirred up trouble within, so that my inward part, is wholly as my outward part.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p10"></A>9.&#160; With what face, O my Lord, shall I call on Thee to send, a camp of holy ones, to guard my bosom, which is full of uncleanness?</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p11"></A>10.&#160; With Thy new leaven, Thou hast chastened creation.&#160; Make Thou the old leaven, which ensnares and humbles, to be like the new leaven!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p12"></A>11.&#160; By the manifest striving, of Thy power let us conquer; lest error should crown, those that strive for Thee, cleaving <i>to them</i> with blandishment!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p13"></A>12.&#160; If we look into our time, it is like our deceit;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_349"></A><A HREF="#fn_349"><FONT SIZE="1">350</FONT></A>
&#8212;for in the years of truthfulness, we practised divinations,&#8212;and secretly used enchantments.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p15"></A>13.&#160; If I look into the time, it provokes and into light,&#8212;brings secret things, that our deceit may be shamed,&#8212;which wore the raiment of Truth.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p16"></A>14.&#160; Verily it is truth, that overcomes all;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_350"></A><A HREF="#fn_350"><FONT SIZE="1">351</FONT></A>
&#8212;and the sea with its bitterness, cannot trouble it,&#8212;for it is pure in its nature.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p18"></A>15.&#160; In wisdom Thou hast made it, O my Lord, that it has laid bare our lust.&#8212;That the foolish should come to nought, and should not be encouraged,&#8212;<i>Truth</i> has withheld the crown.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p19"></A>16.&#160; On the tottering walls, whereon Thou hast given me victory,&#8212;the unthankful repay Thee, with sacrifice and libation, which provoke Thee openly.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p20"></A>17.&#160; If it were at that time, sacrifices had been offered;&#8212;there had been room even, for delusion to suppose,&#8212;that in these I was delivered.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.x-p21"></A>18.&#160; Through the multitude of deliverances, Thou hast rebuked two things:&#8212;the delusion of graven images, and the teaching of magicians;&#8212;for in Thee, O my Lord, have I been delivered!</p>
