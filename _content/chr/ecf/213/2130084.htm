<p class="c22"><a name="ii.vii.ii-p2"></A>To Conon, Abbot of Lirinus (Lerins).</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="ii.vii.ii-p3"></A>Gregory to Conon, Abbot of the Monastery of Lirinus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">126</FONT></A>
.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vii.ii-p5"></A>The carefulness of persons in authority is the safeguard of subjects, since one who watches over what is entrusted to him avoids the snares of the enemy.&#160; But how skilful thou art in ruling the brethren, and how earnestly watchful in keeping guard over them, we have learnt from the report of our most reverend brother and fellow-bishop Mennas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">127</FONT></A>
.&#160; And as our hearing of the unwary remissness of thy predecessor often saddened us, so the carefulness of thy foresight gladdens us, since there is no doubt that the safeguard of thy earnestness is of profit for reward to thee, and for example to do good to others.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vii.ii-p7"></A>But, since the more our adversary knows himself to be guarded against on all sides, the more he seeks to break in by hidden ways, and strives with cunning art to overthrow his opponent, let the watchfulness of thy Love ever kindle itself to more ardent care; and so, with God&#146;s help, fortify all beforehand, that the ravening wolf, running about hither and thither, may have no place for entering among the Lord&#146;s sheep.&#160; Be it then thine earnest endeavour, the grace of our Redeemer aiding thee, to prohibit and in all ways guard those who are committed to thee from gluttony, from pride, from avarice, from idle speaking, and from all uncleanness; that by so much the greater reward may accrue to thee from the government committed to thee as thy subjects, through thy vigilance, shall be conquerors against the iniquities of the adversary.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vii.ii-p8"></A><A NAME="page_53"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 53</FONT></A> <a name="ii.vii.ii-Page_53"></A>Wherefore let the good feel thee sweet, the bad a corrector.&#160; And even in correction know thou that this order should be observed, that thou shouldest love persons and visit faults; lest, if thou shouldest perchance be disposed to act otherwise, correction should pass into cruelty, and thou shouldest destroy those whom thou desirest to amend.&#160; For thou oughtest so to cut away a sore as not to run the risk of ulcerating what is sound; lest, if thou press in the steel more than the case requires, thou injure him whom thou art in haste to benefit.&#160; For let thy very sweetness be wary, not remiss; and let thy correction be loving, not severe.&#160; But let the one be so seasoned by the other that both the good may have, in loving, something to beware of, and the bad, in fearing, something to love.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vii.ii-p9"></A>Attend carefully to these things, most beloved son; earnestly observe them; that, when through such management thou shalt have given back safe to God those whom thou hast received from Him, thou mayest be counted worthy in the day of eternal retribution to hear Him say, <i>Well done, thou good and faithful servant:&#160; because thou hast been faithful in a few things, I will set thee over many things:&#160; enter into the joy of thy Lord</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#017">Luke xix. 17</a><a name="ii.vii.ii-p9.1"></A>).&#160; Further, we desire that our son Columbus the presbyter, who is commended to thy Charity by his own merits, may advance in thy love from our commendation also.</p>
