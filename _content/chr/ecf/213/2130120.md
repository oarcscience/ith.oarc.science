<span id="ii.vii.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.vii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXXVIII.</span>

<span id="ii.vii.xxxviii-p2"></span>*To Barbara and Antonina* <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185) .

<span id="ii.vii.xxxviii-p4"></span>Gregory to Barbara, &c.

<span id="ii.vii.xxxviii-p5"></span>On receiving your epistles, I was in
all manner of ways delighted to hear of your well being, and I entreat
Almighty God that He would guard you by His protection from malignant
spirits in thought, and from perverse men, and from all contrariety; and
that He would, with the grace of His fear, settle you in unions worthy
of you, and cause us all to rejoice in your settlement <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186) .  But do you, most sweet daughters,
rest your hope on His help, and, being always under the shadow of His
defence, both by praying and by well doing, escape the plots of bad
men.  For, whatever human comforts or adversities there may be, there
are none, unless either His grace protects or His displeasure troubles
you.  Rest therefore your hope on no one among men, but bind your whole
soul to trust in Almighty God.  While we sleep, then, He will protect
you, of whom it is written, *Behold he that keepeth Israel shall neither
slumber nor sleep* ([Psa. 121.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#004)<span
id="ii.vii.xxxviii-p6.3"></span>) <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187) .

<span id="ii.vii.xxxviii-p8"></span>As to your saying that you are in
haste to approach the threshhold of the blessed Peter, Prince of the
apostles, I wish exceedingly, and wait with fervent desire, to see you
in his church united to husbands well worthy of you; that so both you
may obtain some little comfort from me, and I no little joy from your
presence.  I have also commended your causes to thy most reverend
brother the bishop John <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188) , and to
Romanus the guardian (*defensori*), that under God they may accomplish
what they have begun.

<span id="ii.vii.xxxviii-p10"></span>Your present of two *racanæ* <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189) , which you sent me word were your
work, I accepted gladly.  But yet know ye that I did not believe the
word you sent me.  For you are seeking praise from the work of others,
seeing that you have perhaps never yet put hand to spindle.  Nor yet
does this circumstance distress me, since I wish you to love the reading
of Holy Scripture, that, so long as Almighty God shall unite you to
husbands, you may know how you should live and how you should manage
your houses.

<span id="ii.vii.xxxviii-p3"></span> See above, Epp. XXXV., XXXVI., in
this book, and I. 34, note 8, there referred to.

id="ii.vii.xxxviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii.xxxviii-p6"></span> If the marriage of the parents,
Venantius and Italica, took place, as conjectured in the note to I. 34,
in the eleventh Indiction (<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vii.xxxviii-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> 592–3), and this letter was
written in the fourth (<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vii.xxxviii-p6.2"></span>a.d.</span> 600–1), the daughters would
not be more than seven or eight years of age.  Still, even at this early
age, their betrothal may have been contemplated with a view to their
settlement in life.  But Venantius may have married earlier than 592–3,
soon after his return to a secular life, and so the girls may have been
a little older.  Neither, however, if our dates are right, could be more
than ten years old.
