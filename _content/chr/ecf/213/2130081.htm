<p class="c22"><a name="ii.vi.xiv-p2"></A>To Dominicus, Bishop of Carthage.</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="ii.vi.xiv-p3"></A>Gregory to Dominicus, &amp;c.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vi.xiv-p4"></A>We have already learnt what great pestilence has invaded the African parts; and, inasmuch as neither is Italy free from such affliction, doubled are the groans of our sorrows.&#160; But amid these evils and other innumerable calamities our heart, dearest brother, would fail from desperate distress, had not the Lord&#146;s voice fortified our weakness beforehand.&#160; For long ago to the faithful the trumpet of the Gospel lesson sounded, warning them that at the approach of the end of the world wars and many other things, which, as you know, are now feared, would come to pass (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#000">Matt. 24:0</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#000">Luke 21:0</a><a name="ii.vi.xiv-p4.1"></A>.).&#160; We ought not, then, to be too much afflicted in suffering things that we knew of beforehand, as though they had been unknown.&#160; Frequently also, in our consideration of another&#146;s death, the kind of death may be an alleviation.&#160; For what manglings, what cruelties have we seen, where death was the only remedy, and life was a torment!&#160; Did not David, when a choice of deaths was offered him, refuse famine or the sword, and choose that his people should fall under the hand of God?&#160; Gather ye from this how great favour is granted to such as perish under Divine smiting, since they die by the call that was offered to the holy prophet for a boon.&#160; Wherefore let us return thanks to our Creator in all adversities, and, trusting in His mercy, bear all things patiently, since we suffer much less than we deserve.&#160; Since, however, we are so scourged temporally that we may not be left without the consolation of life eternal, it is needful (since we are not ignorant, through the announcements of these signs, that the Judge Who is to come is at hand) that we should so much the more, by zeal for good works and the wailing of penitence, make secure our accounts which we shall have to submit to His scrutiny; so that such great smitings may be to us, by the favour of His grace, not the beginning of damnation, but a purgation for our good.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vi.xiv-p5"></A>Since, however, the nature of our infirmity is such that we cannot but grieve for those who pass away, let the teaching of your Fraternity be a consolation to the afflicted.&#160; Instil into them that the good things which are promised will remain with them; so that, strengthened by a most sure hope, they may learn not to grieve for the loss of temporal things in comparison with the gift to come.&#160; Let your tongue, as indeed we believe it does, restrain them more and more from the perpetration of evil deeds; let it announce the rewards of the good, the punishments of the bad, so that those who have little love for good things may at least be greatly afraid of bad things, and keep themselves from the things which must be punished.&#160; For to commit things worthy of scourges when placed in the midst of scourges is to be peculiarly proud against the smiter, and provokes the incensed one to fiercer anger.&#160; And it is a prime kind of madness for any one to be unwilling to desist justly from his own evil, and to wish God to cease unjustly from His vengeance.&#160; But, since in all this there is need of Divine help, let us, beloved brother, with united prayers implore the clemency of Almighty God, that He would both grant unto us thus to acquit ourselves worthily, and mercifully stir the hearts of the people to perform such things; to the end that, while we order our actions wholesomely in His fear, we may be counted worthy both to be delivered from impending evils, and, by the leading of His grace, without which we can do nothing, to come to supernal joys.</p>
