<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p2"></A>1.&#160; In the Birth of the Son light dawned,&#8212;and darkness fled from the world,&#8212;and the earth was enlightened; then let it give glory&#8212;to the brightness of the Father Who has enlightened it!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p3"></A>2.&#160; He dawned from the womb of the Virgin,&#8212;and the shadows passed away when He was seen,&#8212;and the darkness of error was strangled by Him,&#8212;and the ends of the earth were enlightened that they should give glory.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p4"></A>3.&#160; Among the peoples there was great tumult,&#8212;and in the darkness the light dawned,&#8212;and the nations rejoiced to give glory&#8212;to Him in Whose Birth they all were enlightened.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p5"></A>4.&#160; His light shone out over the east;&#8212;Persia was enlightened by the star:&#8212;<i>His</i> Epiphany gave good tidings to her and invited her,&#8212;&#8220;He is come for the sacrifice that brings joy to all.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p6"></A>5.&#160; The star of light hasted and came and dawned&#8212;through the darkness, and summoned them&#8212;that the peoples should come and exult&#8212;in the great Light that has come down to earth.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p7"></A>6.&#160; One envoy from among the stars&#8212;the firmament sent to proclaim to them,&#8212;to the sons of Persia, that they might make ready&#8212;to meet the King and to worship Him.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p8"></A>7.&#160; Great Assyria when she perceived <i>it</i>&#8212;called to the Magi and said to them,&#8212;&#8220;Take gifts and go, honour Him&#8212;the great King Who in Judea has dawned.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p9"></A>8.&#160; The princes of Persia, exulting,&#8212;carried gifts from their region;&#8212;and they brought to the Son of the Virgin&#8212;gold and myrrh and frankincense.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p10"></A>9.&#160; They entered and found Him as a child&#8212;as He dwelt in the house of the lowly woman;&#8212;and they drew near and worshipped with gladness,&#8212;and brought near before Him their treasures.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p11"></A>10.&#160; Mary said, &#8220;For whom are these?&#8212;and for what purpose? and what <i>is</i> the cause&#8212;that has called you to come from your country&#8212;to the Child with your treasures?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p12"></A>11.&#160; They said, &#8220;Thy Son is a King,&#8212;and He binds crowns and is King of all;&#8212;and great <i>is</i> His power over the world,&#8212;and to His Kingdom shall all be obedient.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p13"></A>12.&#160; &#8220;At what time did this come to pass,&#8212;that a lowly woman should bring forth a King?&#160; I who am in need and in want,&#8212;how then could a king come forth from me?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p14"></A>13.&#160; &#8220;In thee alone has this come to pass&#8212;that a mighty King from thee should appear;&#8212;thee in whom poverty shall be magnified,&#8212;and to thy Son shall crowns be made subject.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p15"></A>14.&#160; &#8220;Treasures of Kings I have not;&#8212;riches have never fallen to my lot.&#8212;My house is lowly and my dwelling needy;&#8212;why then proclaim ye that my Son is King?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p16"></A>15.&#160; &#8220;Great treasure is in thy Son,&#8212;and wealth that suffices to make all rich;&#8212;for the treasures of kings are impoverished,&#8212;but He fails not nor can be measured.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p17"></A>16.&#160; &#8220;Whether haply some other be for you&#8212;the King that is born, enquire ye concerning Him.&#8212;This is the son of a lowly woman,&#8212;of <i>one</i> who is not meet to look on a King.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p18"></A>17.&#160; &#8220;Can it be that light should ever miss&#8212;the way whereon it has been sent?&#160; It was not darkness that summoned and led us;&#8212;in light we walked, and thy Son is King.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p19"></A>18.&#160; &#8220;Lo! ye see a babe without speech,&#8212;and the house of His mother empty and needy,&#8212;and of that which pertains to a king nought is in it:&#8212;how then in it is a king to be seen?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p20"></A>19.&#160; &#8220;Lo! we see that without speech and at rest&#8212;<i>is</i> the King, and lowly as thou <A NAME="page_288"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 288</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vi.xvi-Page_288"></A>hast said:&#8212;but again we see that the stars&#8212;in the highest He bids haste to proclaim Him.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p21"></A>20.&#160; &#8220;It were meet, O men, that ye should enquire&#8212;who is the King, and then adore him;&#8212;lest haply <i>your</i> way has been mistaken,&#8212;and another is the King that is born.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p22"></A>21.&#160; &#8220;It were meet, O maiden, that thou shouldst receive it,&#8212;that we have learned that thy Son is King,&#8212;from the <i>star of</i> light that errs not,&#8212;and plain is the way, and he has led us.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p23"></A>22.&#160; &#8220;The Child is a little one, and lo! he has not&#8212;the diadem of a king and of a throne;&#8212;and what have ye seen that ye should pay honour to Him,&#8212;as to a king, with your treasures?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p24"></A>23.&#160; &#8220;A little one, because He willed <i>it</i> for quietness&#146; sake,&#8212;and meek now until He be revealed.&#8212;A time shall be for Him when all diadems&#8212;shall bow down and worship Him.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p25"></A>24.&#160; &#8220;Armies he has none;&#8212;nor has my Son legions and troops:&#8212;in the poverty of His mother He dwells;&#8212;why then King is He called by you?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p26"></A>25.&#160; &#8220;The armies of thy Son are above;&#8212;they ride on high, and they flame,&#8212;and one of them it was that came and summoned us,&#8212;and all our country was dismayed.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p27"></A>26.&#160; &#8220;The Child is a babe, and how is it possible&#8212;He should be King, unknown to the world?&#8212;And they that are mighty and of renown,&#8212;how can a babe be their ruler?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p28"></A>27.&#160; &#8220;Thy babe is aged, O Virgin,&#8212;and Ancient of Days and exalted above all and Adam beside Him is very babe,&#8212;and in Him <i>all</i> created things are made new.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p29"></A>28.&#160; &#8220;It is very seemly that ye should expound&#8212;all the mystery and explain <i>it</i>;&#8212;who <i>it</i> is that reveals to you the mystery of my Son,&#8212;that He is a King in your region.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p30"></A>29.&#160; &#8220;It is likewise seemly for thee to accept this,&#8212;that unless the truth had led us we had not wandered hither from the ends of the earth,&#8212;nor come for the sake of thy Son.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p31"></A>30.&#160; &#8220;All the mystery as it was wrought&#8212;among you there in your country,&#8212;reveal ye to me now as friends.&#8212;Who was He that called you to come to me?&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p32"></A>31.&#160; &#8220;A mighty Star appeared to us&#8212;that was glorious exceedingly above the stars,&#8212;and our land by its fire was kindled;&#8212;that this King had appeared it bore tidings to us.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p33"></A>32.&#160; &#8220;Do not, I beseech you, speak of&#8212;these things in our land lest they rage,&#8212;<i>and</i> the kings of the earth join together&#8212;against the Child in their envy.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p34"></A>33.&#160; &#8220;Be not thou dismayed, O Virgin!&#8212;Thy Son shall bring to nought all diadems, and set them underneath his heel;&#8212;and they shall not subdue Him Whom they envy.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p35"></A>34.&#160; &#8220;Because of Herod I am afraid,&#8212;that unclean wolf, lest he assail me,&#8212;and draw his sword and with it cut off&#8212;the sweet cluster before it be ripe.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p36"></A>35.&#160; &#8220;Because of Herod fear thou not;&#8212;for in the hands of thy Son is his throne placed:&#8212;and as soon as He shall reign it shall be laid low,&#8212;and his diadem shall fall on the earth beneath.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p37"></A>36.&#160; &#8220;A torrent of blood is Jerusalem,&#8212;wherein the excellent ones are slain;&#8212;and if she perceives Him she will assail Him.&#8212;In mystery speak ye, and noise <i>it</i> not abroad.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p38"></A>37.&#160; &#8220;All torrents, and likewise swords,&#8212;by the hands of thy Son shall be appeased;&#8212;and the sword of Jerusalem shall be blunted,&#8212;and shall not desire at all to kill.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p39"></A>38.&#160; &#8220;The scribes of the priests of Jerusalem&#8212;pour forth blood and heed not.&#8212;<A NAME="page_289"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 289</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vi.xvi-Page_289"></A>They will arouse murderous strife&#8212;against me and against the Child; O Magi, be silent!&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p40"></A>39.&#160; &#8220;The scribes and the priests will be unable&#8212;to hurt thy son in their envy;&#8212;for by Him their priesthood shall be dissolved,&#8212;and their festivals brought to nought.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p41"></A>40.&#160; &#8220;A Watcher revealed to me, when I received&#8212;conception of the Babe, that my Son is a King;&#8212;that His diadem is from on high and is not dissolved,&#8212;he declared to me even as ye <i>do</i>.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p42"></A>41.&#160; &#8220;The Watcher, therefore, of whom thou hast spoken&#8212;is he who came as a star,&#8212;and was shown to us and brought us good tidings&#8212;that He is great and glorious above the stars.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p43"></A>42.&#160; &#8220;That Angel declared to me&#8212;in his good tidings, when he appeared to me,&#8212;that to His Kingdom no end shall be&#8212;and the mystery is kept and shall not be revealed.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p44"></A>43.&#160; &#8220;The Star also declared again to us&#8212;that thy Son is He that shall keep the diadem.&#8212;His aspect was something changed,&#8212;and he was the Angel and made <i>it</i> not known to us.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p45"></A>44.&#160; &#8220;Before me when the Watcher showed himself,&#8212;he called Him his Lord before He was conceived;&#8212;and as the Son of the Highest announced Him to me:&#8212;but where His Father is he made not known to me.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p46"></A>45. &#160;&#8220;Before us he proclaimed in the form of a star&#8212;that the Lord of the Highest is He Who is born;&#8212;and over the stars of light thy Son <i>is</i> ruler,&#8212;and unless He commands they rise not.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p47"></A>46.&#160; &#8220;In your presence, lo! there are revealed&#8212;other mysteries, that ye may learn the truth;&#8212;how in virginity I bare my Son,&#8212;and He is Son of God; go ye, proclaim Him!&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p48"></A>47.&#160; &#8220;In our presence the Star taught <i>us</i>&#8212;that His Birth is exalted above the world and above all beings is thy Son,&#8212;and is Son of God according to thy saying.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p49"></A>48.&#160; &#8220;The <i>world</i> on high and the <i>world</i> below bear witness to Him,&#8212;all the Watchers and the stars,&#8212;that He is Son of God and Lord.&#8212;Bear ye His fame to your lands!&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p50"></A>49.&#160; &#8220;All the world on high, in one star,&#8212;has stirred up Persia and she has learnt the truth,&#8212;that thy Son is Son of God,&#8212;and to Him shall all peoples be subject.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p51"></A>50.&#160; &#8220;Peace bear ye to your lands:&#8212;peace be multiplied in your borders!&#8212;As apostles of truth may ye be believed&#8212;in all the way that ye shall pass through.&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p52"></A>51.&#160; &#8220;The peace of thy Son, it shall bear us&#8212;in tranquillity to our land, as it has led us <i>hither</i>;&#8212;and when His power shall have grasped the worlds,&#8212;may He visit our land and bless it!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p53"></A>52.&#160; &#8220;May Persia rejoice in your glad tidings!&#8212;may Assyria exult in your coming&#8212;And when my Son&#146;s Kingdom shall arise,&#8212;may He plant His standard in your country!&#8221;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.xvi-p54"></A>53.&#160; Let the Church sing with rejoicing,&#8212;&#8220;Glory in the Birth of the Highest,&#8212;by Whom the world above and the world below are illumined!&#8221;&#8212;Blessed <i>be</i> He in Whose Birth all are made glad!</p>
