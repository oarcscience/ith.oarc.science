id="ii.v.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXXIX.</span>

<span id="ii.v.xxxvi-p2"></span>*To Marinianus, Bishop of Ravenna* <span
id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47) .

<span id="ii.v.xxxvi-p4"></span>Gregory to Marinianus, &c.

<span id="ii.v.xxxvi-p5"></span>What is to be done in the case of
Maximus you have learnt from the letters which we have before sent to
you.  But, since we have ascertained from the report of our Chartulary
Castorius, the bearer of these presents, what is the wish, or rather the
request, of your Fraternity in this matter, therefore if the said
Maximus, in the presence of you and our aforesaid Chartulary, shall
purge himself on oath from simoniacal heresy, and with respect to other
charges shall, before the body of Saint Apollinaris, as we have written,
reply only, when interrogated, that he is guiltless, we commit his cause
to the judgment of your Fraternity, with regard to his having presumed
to celebrate the solemnities of mass while excommunicated, as to what
penance such fault shall be purged by.  And so, whatever according to
God seems good to you, do you settle without fear, and entertain no
doubt with regard to us.  For whatsoever may be ordained by you
concerning this cause we both thankfully accept and willingly allow. 
Yet we exhort you that you should be careful, and so temper what you
provide for being done as both to deal kindly with him, if so it shall
seem fit, and by a suitable arrangement to observe, as you ought, the
genius of ecclesiastical vigour.  We have instructed the above-named
bearer, while present with us, how he is to act with you; and, having
learnt all thoroughly from him, do you so acquit yourselves in all
respects that in your anxious care we may feel that our presence has
been with you.
