id="ii.x.ii-p1.1"></span>Epistle IV.</span>

<span id="ii.x.ii-p2"></span>To Fantinus, Guardian (Defensorem) of
Panormus.

<span id="ii.x.ii-p3"></span>Gregory to Fantinus, &c

<span id="ii.x.ii-p4"></span>Such things about our brother and
fellow-bishop Exhilaratus, as thou thyself also knowest, have come to
our ears as ought by all means to be visited with severe punishment. 
But, since it has been smoothed over by our most reverend brother and
fellow-bishop Leo <span id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232) , who has also
declared that he was judge in that case, we have thought it fit that he
\[i.e. Exhilaratus\] should be sent back to his Church, considering that
what we have inflicted on him by keeping him here so long may be enough
for him.  Therefore we enjoin thy Experience to pay attention to his
manners and deeds, and to admonish him frequently, to the end that he
may shew himself solicitous in extending kind charity to his clerks
(*clericis*), and, should need require, in correcting faults.  But we
desire thee also to admonish his clergy that they exhibit humility
towards him, and the obedience which the Lord commands, nor in any
respect presume to behave proudly with regard to him.  And if any one of
them, that is, either bishop or clerk, should disregard thy admonition,
do thou, under this authority from us, either correct the sin of
disobedience by canonical coercion, as thou seest fit, or make haste to
send a report to us, that we may be able to arrange how the rein of
discipline may keep from going off their road those whom the goad of
evil inclination provokes to transgression.
