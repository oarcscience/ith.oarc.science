<p class="c37"><a name="iii.iv.iii-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.iv.iii-p1.1"></A>Hymn II.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.iii-p2"></A>1.&#160; This day are opened, our mouths to give thanks.&#160; They who opened the breaches, have opened my sons&#146; mouths.&#160; Thank the Merciful, who has delivered the men of our <i>city</i>, nor thought at that time of exacting the debts that were due by us.&#160; When they rose up they that took us cap<A NAME="page_169"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 169</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.iii-Page_169"></A>tive, the worlds in our deliverance, tasted of Thy graciousness.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p3"></A><i>R</i>.&#160; From all that have mouths, glory be to Thy grace!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p4"></A>2.&#160; He has saved us without wall, and taught us that He is our wall:&#160; He has saved us without king and made us know that is our king:&#160; He has saved us, in each and all, and showed us that He is All:&#160; He has saved us in His grace and again reveals, that freely He has mercy and quickens.&#160; From every boaster, He takes away his boasting, and gives it to His own grace.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p5"></A>3.&#160; The sound of all mouths, is too little for Thy praise:&#160; for lo! in the hour when our light was smoking, and was at the point to be quenched (seeing that all is easy to Thee) of a sudden it awoke and shone!&#160; Who has seen these two marvels, that for him whose hope was cut off, hope has sprung up and increased; the hour of mourning has been turned into good tidings?</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p6"></A>4.&#160; This is a festival day, whereon hang the feasts:&#160; for if wrath had taken us captive, lo! our feasts too had ceased.&#160; Whereas our peace has conquered and triumphed, lo! our festivals resound.&#160; This blessed day supports all:&#160; upon it depends the city, on the city depends the people, on the people depends peace, on peace depends all.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p7"></A>5.&#160; Out of these breaches, Thou hast multiplied triumphs.&#160; Praise unto the Triune God goes up from the three breaches; for that He descended and repaired them, in His mercy which restrains wrath.&#160; He smote <i>the enemy</i> who understood not that He was teaching us.&#160; He taught those within, for in His justice He made the breaches; He taught those without, for in His goodness He repaired them.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p8"></A>6.&#160; Speak and give glory, my delivered ones on this day; old men and boys, young men and maidens, children and innocents, and thou, O Church, mother of the city!&#160; For the old men have been rescued from captivity, the youths from torture, the sucklings from being dashed in pieces, the women from dishonour, and the Church from mockery.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p9"></A>7.&#160; He came to us with hardness; we were afraid for a moment: He came in gentleness, and we rejoiced for an hour.&#160; He turned and left us for a little, we wandered without end; like a beast of prey which is trained by blandishments and by fear, but if so be that men turn <i>from it</i>, rebels and strays and becomes savage in the midst of peace.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p10"></A>8.&#160; He punished us and we feared not; He rescued us, and we were not shamed:&#160; He straitened us and our vows were multiplied; He enlarged <i>us</i> and our crimes were multiplied.&#160; When He constrained there was a covenant, when He gave breathing-space there was straying.&#160; Though He knew us He lowered Himself to establish us.&#160; In the evening we exalted Him; in the morning we rejected Him.&#160; When necessity left us, faithfulness left us.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p11"></A>9.&#160; He afflicted us by the breaches, that He might punish our crimes:&#160; He raised the mounds that thereby, He might humble our boasting.&#160; He made a breach for the seas that thereby, He might wash away our pollution.&#160; He shut us in that we might gather together in His Temple.&#160; He shut us in and we were quenched; He set us free and we went astray.&#160; We are like unto wool, which passes into every colour.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p12"></A>10.&#160; We know that when the blessed sons of Nineveh repented, it was not because of mounds they repented, nor yet by means of waters, nor was it by reason of a breach, nor yet by reason of bows; it was not at the sound of the bowstring they feared and repented.&#160; They harkened to a feeble voice; they caused their little ones to fast; they made their youths chaste, they made their kings humble.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p13"></A>11.&#160; Thou smotest us and we justified Thee, for it befel not by chance; Thou deliveredst us and we gave thanks, for it was not that we were worthy.&#160; Thou hadst mercy on us not because Thou erredst, in hoping that we should repent.&#160; It was manifest to Thee that when Thou hadst mercy on us we strayed.&#160; Thou knewest that we had sinned; Thou knewest that we are sinners:&#160; with our <A NAME="page_170"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 170</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.iii-Page_170"></A>iniquity that has been and is, Thou wast acquainted when Thou hadst mercy on us.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p14"></A>12.&#160; Weigh our repentance, that it may outbalance our crimes!&#160; But not in even balance, ascends either weight; for our crimes are heavy and manifold, and our repentance is light.&#160; He had commanded that we should be sold for our debt:&#160; His mercy became our advocate; principal and increase, we repaid with the farthing, which our repentance proffered.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p15"></A>13.&#160; Ten thousand talents for that little <i>payment</i>, our debt He forgave us.&#160; He was bound to exact it, that He might appease His justice:&#160; He was constrained again to forgive, that He might make His grace to rejoice.&#160; Our tears for the twinkling of an eye we gave Him; He satisfied His justice, in exacting and taking a little; He made His grace to rejoice, <i>when</i> for a little He forgave much.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p16"></A>14.&#160; Ten thousand <i>are the</i> crimes that He has pardoned; ten thousand tongues, are unable to suffice, in presence of His goodness.&#160; He has pardoned us and we have not pardoned; we have requited to Him contrariwise; the guilt committed we write up afresh.&#160; &#8220;Pardon, O Lord,&#8221; we cry; &#8220;Requite, O Lord,&#8221; we pray:&#160; &#8220;pardon&#8221; verily when we have done wrong; &#8220;requite&#8221; verily when wrong is done us.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p17"></A>15.&#160; Yea not as those without, have we laboured for our lives.&#160; They have raised their mounds, but we not even our voices:&#160; they have broken through the wall, but we&#8212;not even the chains, the frail chains on our heart within have we broken.&#160; <i>God</i> has rejected the diligent, for the sake of the slothful; He has rejected the labour done without, though He was rejected from within.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p18"></A>16.&#160; He has set free them that talked, and smitten the silent; the wall was beaten, and the people were instructed:&#160; He spared them that can suffer, He smote that which knows no suffering.&#160; For instead of souls that feel, He smote the stones that feel not, that He might chasten us.&#160; In His love He spared our bodies, and hasted to smite our wall.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p19"></A>17.&#160; Who has ever seen, that a breach became as a mirror?&#160; Two parties looked thereinto; it served for those without and those within.&#160; They saw therein as with eyes, the Power that breaks down and builds up:&#160; they saw Him who made the breach and again repaired <i>it</i>.&#160; Those without saw His might; they departed and tarried not till evening:&#160; those within saw His help; they gave thanks yet sufficed not.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p20"></A>18.&#160; Let the day of thy deliverance, arouse thee from sloth!&#160; When the wall was broken through, when the elephants pressed in, when the javelins showered, when men did valiantly, then was there a sight for the heavenly ones.&#160; Iniquity fought there; mercy triumphed there; lovingkindness prevailed below; the watchers shouted on high.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p21"></A>19.&#160; And thine enemy wearied himself, <i>striving</i> to smite by his wiles, the wall that encompassed thee, a bulwark to thine inhabitants.&#160; He wearied himself and availed not; and in order that he might not hope, that if He broke through He should also enter and take us captive, he broke it through and not once only; and was put to shame, nor was that enough, even unto three times, that he might be shamed thrice in the three.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p22"></A>20.&#160; Let my happiness by <i>God&#146;s</i> grace, be also multiplied in thy midst!&#160; Whereas in thee my crimes have been many, many be in thee my fruits!&#160; Whereas in thee I have sinned in my youth, in thee let there be mercy for my old age!&#160; By the mouth of thy sons pray for thy son, for I have sinned beyond my ability, and have repented below my ability; I have scattered above measure, and have gathered below measure.</p>
