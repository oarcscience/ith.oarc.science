<span id="iii.vii.viii"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.vii.viii-p1.1"></span>Hymn VII.</span>

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p2"></span>1.  As in a race saw I the disputers,
the children of strife, \[trying\] to taste fire, to see the air, to
handle the light:  they were troubled at the gleaming, and struggled to
make divisions.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p3"></span>The Son, Who is too subtle for the
mind, did they seek to feel:  and the Holy Ghost Who cannot be explored,
they thought to explore with their questionings.  The Father, Who never
at any time was searched out, have they explained and disputed of.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p4"></span>The sound form of our faith is from
Abraham, and our repentance is from Nineveh and the house of
Rahab, <span id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547) and ours are the
expectations of the Prophets, <span id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548)
ours of the Apostles.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p7"></span>2.  And envy is from Satan:  the evil
usage of the evil calf is from the Egyptians. <span
id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549)   The hateful sight of the hateful
image of four faces is from the Hittites. <span
id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550)   Accursed disputation, that hidden
moth, is from the Greeks.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p10"></span>The bitter \[enemy\] read and saw
orthodox teachings, and subverted them; he saw hateful things, and sowed
them; and he saw hope, and he turned it upside down and cut it off.  The
disputation that he planted, lo! it has yielded a fruit bitter to the
tooth.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p11"></span>3.  Satan saw that the Truth
strangled him, and united himself to the tares, and <span
id="page_300">p. 300</span> <span
id="iii.vii.viii-Page_300"></span>secreted his frauds, and spread his
snares for the faith, and cast upon the priests the darts of the love of
pre-eminence.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p12"></span>They made contests for the throne, to
see which should first obtain it.  There was that meditated in secret
and kept it close:  there was that openly combated for it:  and there
was that with a bribe crept up to it:  and there was that with fraud
dealt wisely to obtain it.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p13"></span>The paths differed, the scope was
one, and they were alike.  Him that was young, and could not even think
of it, because it was not time for him; and him that was hoary and
shaped out dreams for time beyond; all of them by his craftiness did the
wicked one persuade and subdue.  Old men, youths, and even striplings,
aim at rank!

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p14"></span>4.  His former books did Satan put
aside, and put on others:  the People who was grown old had the moth and
the worm devoured and eaten and left and deserted:  the moth came into
the new garment of the new peoples:

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p15"></span>He saw the crucifiers who were
rejected and cast forth as strangers:  he made of those of the
household, pryers; and of worshippers, they became disputants.  From
that garment the moth gendered and wound it up and deposited it.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p16"></span>The worm gendered in the storehouse
of wheat, and sat and looked on:  and lo! the pure wheat was mildewed,
and devoured were the garments of glory!  He made a mockery of us, and
we of ourselves, since we were besotted!

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p17"></span>He showed tares, and the bramble shot
up in the pure vineyard!  He infected the flock, and the leprosy broke
out, and the sheep became hired servants of his!  He began in the
People, and came unto the Gentiles, that he might finish.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p18"></span>5.  Instead of the reed which the
former people made the Son hold, others have dared with their reed <span
id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551) to write in their tracts that He is
only a Son of man.  Reed for reed does the wicked one exchange against
our Redeemer, and instead of the coat of many colours, <span
id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552) wherewith they clothed Him, titles has
he dyed craftily.  With diversity of names he clothed Him; either that
of a creature or of a thing made, when He was the Maker.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p21"></span>And as he plaited for Him by silent
men speechless thorns that cry out, thorns from the mind has he plaited
\[now\] by the voice, as hymns; and concealed the spikes amid melodies
that they might not be perceived. <span
id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553)

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p23"></span>6.  When Satan saw that he was
detected in his former \[frauds\]; that the spitting was discovered, and
vinegar, and thorns, nails and wood, garments and reed and spear, which
smote him, and were hated and openly known; he changed his frauds.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p24"></span>Instead of the blow with the hand, by
which our Lord was overcome, he brought in distractions; and instead of
the spitting, cavilling entered in; and instead of garments, secret
divisions; and instead of the reed, came in strife to smite us on the
face.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p25"></span>Haughtiness called for rage its
sister, and there answered and came envy, and wrath, and pride, and
fraud.  They have taken counsel against our Redeemer as on that day when
they took counsels at His Passion.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p26"></span>And instead of the cross, a hidden
wood hath strife become; and instead of the nails, questionings have
come in; and instead of hell, apostasy:  the pattern of both Satan would
renew again.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p27"></span>Instead of the sponge which was
cankered with vinegar and wormwood, he gave <span id="page_301">p.
301</span> <span id="iii.vii.viii-Page_301"></span>prying, the whole of
which is cankered with death.  The gall which they gave Him did our Lord
put away from Him; the subtle questioning, which the rebellious one hath
given, to fools is sweet.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p28"></span>7.  And at that time there were
judges against them, <span id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554) lo, the
judges are, as it were, against us, and instead of a handwriting are
their commands.  Priests that consecrate crowns, set snares for kings.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p30"></span>Instead of the priesthood praying for
royalty that wars may cease from among men, they teach wars of
overthrow, which set kings to combat with those round about.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p31"></span>O Lord, make the priests and kings
peaceful; that in one Church priests may pray for their kings, and kings
spare those round about them; and may the peace which is within Thee
become ours, Lord, Thou that art within and without all things! <span
id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555)
