<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p2"></A>1.&#160; Herein <i>is</i> a mirror to be blamed,&#8212;if its clearness is darkened&#8212;because there are spots on its substance;&#8212;for the foulness that is on it becomes&#8212;a covering before them that look on it.&#160; <i>R.&#160; Blessed be He Who polished our mirror!</i></p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p3"></A>2.&#160; For that comeliness is not adorned in it,&#8212;and blemishes are not brought to view in it,&#8212;it is altogether a damage to comely things;&#8212;seeing that their comeliness gain not&#8212;adornments as <i>their</i> profit.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p4"></A>3.&#160; Blemishes are not rooted out by it,&#8212;likewise adornments are not multiplied by it.&#8212;A blemish that remains is as a loss;&#8212;that there is no adornment is a defect:&#8212;loss is met together with defect.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p5"></A>4.&#160; If our mirror <i>be</i> darkness,&#8212;it is altogether joy to the hateful;&#8212;because their blemishes <i>are</i> not reproved:&#8212;but if polished and shining,&#8212;it is our freedom that is adorned.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p6"></A>5.&#160; Twofold is the loss in defect,&#8212;for the hateful and for the goodly;&#8212;in that the goodly gain no crown,&#8212;and likewise the hateful get no adorning:&#8212;the mirror divides the loss.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p7"></A>6.&#160; Never does the mirror drive&#8212;by compulsion him that looks therein:&#8212;<i>so</i> likewise grace which followed&#8212;upon the righteousness of the Law,&#8212;does not possess the compulsion of the Law.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p8"></A>7.&#160; Righteousness was unto childhood,&#8212;its adorner of compulsion;&#8212;for when mankind was in childhood,&#8212;she adorned it by compulsion,&#8212;while she robbed it not of its freedom.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p9"></A>8.&#160; Righteousness used blandishment,&#8212;and the rod <i>to deal</i> with childhood;&#8212;when she smote it she roused it; her rod restrained frowardness, her blandishment softened the minds.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p10"></A>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p11"></A>9.&#160; [If one turn from the Gospel,] wherewith we are adorned to-day, my brethren,&#8212;to another gospel he is a child:&#8212;in a time of greatness of understanding,&#8212;he is become without understanding.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p12"></A>10.&#160; For in the degree of full age,&#8212;he has gone down to childhood;&#8212;and he loves the law of bondmen,&#8212;which when he is confident smites him,&#8212;and when he rejoices buffets him.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p13"></A>11.&#160; Whatsoever ornament <i>is</i> compulsion,&#8212;is not true but is borrowed.&#8212;This is a great thing in God&#146;s eyes,&#8212;that a man should be adorned by himself:&#8212;therefore took He away compulsion.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p14"></A>12.&#160; For even as of <i>His</i> prudence&#8212;in its <i>own</i> time He employed compulsion,&#8212;so <i>likewise</i> of His prudence,&#8212;He took it away at a time&#8212;when gentleness was desired in its stead.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p15"></A>13.&#160; For as it is befitting to Youth,&#8212;that it should be made to haste under the rod;&#8212;<i>so</i> <i>is</i> it very hateful that under the rod&#8212;Wisdom should be brought to serve,&#8212;that compulsion should be lord over her.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p16"></A>14.&#160; Behold therefore how likewise&#8212;God has ordered my successions&#8212;in the pastors I have had,&#8212;and in the teachers He has given me,&#8212;and in the fathers He has reckoned unto me!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p17"></A>15.&#160; For weighed out according to their times&#8212;<i>were</i> the helps of their qualities;&#8212;namely in him in whom it was needful, fear; and in whom it was profitable, heartening; and in whom it was becoming, meekness.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p18"></A><A NAME="page_186"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 186</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.xvii-Page_186"></A>16.&#160; By measure He made my steps advance:&#8212;to my childhood He assigned terror; likewise to my youth, fear;&#8212;to my <i>age of</i> wisdom and prudence,&#8212;He assigned and gave meekness.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p19"></A>17.&#160; In the frowardness of the degree of childhood,&#8212;<i>my</i> instructor was a fear to me:&#8212;his rod restrained me from wantonness,&#8212;and from mischief the terror of him,&#8212;and from indulgence the fear of him.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p20"></A>18.&#160; Another father He gave to my youth:&#8212;what there was in me of childishness,&#8212;that was there in him of hardness; what there was in me of maturity,&#8212;that was in him <i>as</i> meekness.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p21"></A>19.&#160; When I rose from the degrees&#8212;of childhood and of youth,&#8212;there passed away the terror <i>that was</i> first,&#8212;there passed away the fear <i>that</i> <i>was</i> second;&#8212;He gave me a kind pastor.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p22"></A>20.&#160; Lo! for my full age his food;&#8212;and for my wisdom his interpretations;&#8212;and for my peace his meekness;&#8212;and for my repose his kindness;&#8212;and for my chastity his gravity!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p23"></A>21.&#160; Blessed is He who as in a balance&#8212;weighed out and gave me fathers:&#8212;for according to my times <i>were</i> my helps;&#8212;and according to my sicknesses my medicines;&#8212;and according to my comelinesses my adornments!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvii-p24"></A>22.&#160; We then <i>are</i> they that have disturbed&#8212;the succession and fair order;&#8212;for in a time of mildness&#8212;lo! we crave for hardness,&#8212;that Thou should rebuke us as though <i>we were</i> children!</p>
