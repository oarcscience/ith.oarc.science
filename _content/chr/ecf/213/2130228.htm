<p class="c23"><a name="iii.v.iii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii-p2.1"></A>Blessed</span> be that Child, Who gladdened Bethlehem to-day!&#160; Blessed be the Babe Who made manhood young again to-day!&#160; Blessed be the Fruit, Who lowered Himself to our famished state!&#160; Blessed be the Good One, Who suddenly enriched our necessitousness and supplied our needs!&#160; Blessed He Whose tender mercies made Him condescend to visit our infirmities!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p3"></A>Praise to the Fountain that was sent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_384"></A><A HREF="#fn_384"><FONT SIZE="1">385</FONT></A>
 for our propitiation.&#160; Praise be to Him Who made void the Sabbath by fulfilling it!&#160; Praise too to Him Who rebuked the leprosy and it remained not, Whom the fever saw and fled!&#160; Praise to the Merciful, Who bore our toil!&#160; Glory to Thy coming, which quickened the sons of men!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p5"></A>Glory to Him, Who came to us by His first-born!&#160; Glory to the Silence,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_385"></A><A HREF="#fn_385"><FONT SIZE="1">386</FONT></A>
 that spake by His Voice.&#160; Glory to the One on high, Who was seen by His Day-spring!&#160; Glory to the Spiritual, Who was pleased to have a Body, that in it His virtue might be felt, and He might by that Body show mercy on His household&#146;s bodies!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p7"></A>Glory to that Hidden One, Whose Son was made manifest!&#160; Glory to that Living One, Whose Son was made to die!&#160; Glory to that Great One, Whose Son descended and was small!&#160; Glory to the Power Who did straiten His greatness by a form, His unseen nature by a shape!&#160; With eye and mind we have beheld Him, yea with both of them.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p8"></A>Glory to that Hidden One, Who even with the mind cannot be felt at all by them that pry into Him; but by His graciousness was felt by the hand of man!&#160; The Nature that could not be touched, by His hands was bound and tied, by His feet was pierced and lifted up.&#160; Himself of His own will He embodied for them that took Him.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p9"></A>Blessed be He Whom free will crucified, because He let it:&#160; blessed be He Whom the wood also did bear, because He allowed it.&#160; Blessed be He Whom the grave bound, that had [thereby] a limit set it.&#160; Blessed be He Whose own will brought Him to the Womb and Birth, to arms and to increase [in stature].&#160; Blessed He whose changes purchased life for human nature.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_386"></A><A HREF="#fn_386"><FONT SIZE="1">387</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p11"></A>Blessed He Who sealed our soul, and adorned it and espoused it to Himself.&#160; Blessed He Who made our Body a tabernacle for His unseen Nature.&#160; Blessed He Who by our tongue interpreted His secret things.&#160; Let us praise that Voice whose glory is hymned with our lute, and His virtue with our harp.&#160; The Gentiles have assembled and have come to hear His strains.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p12"></A>Glory to the Son of the Good One, Whom the sons of the evil one rejected!&#160; Glory to the Son of the Just One, Whom the sons of wickedness crucified!&#160; Glory to Him Who loosed us, and was bound for us all!&#160; Glory to Him Who gave the pledge, and redeemed it too!&#160; Glory to the Beautiful, Who conformed us to His image!&#160; Glory to that Fair One, Who looked not to our foulnesses!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p13"></A>Glory to Him Who sowed His Light in the darkness,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_387"></A><A HREF="#fn_387"><FONT SIZE="1">388</FONT></A>
 and was reproached in His hidden state, and covered His secret things.&#160; He also stripped and took off from us the clothing of our filthiness.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_388"></A><A HREF="#fn_388"><FONT SIZE="1">389</FONT></A>
&#160; Glory be to Him on high, Who mixed His salt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_389"></A><A HREF="#fn_389"><FONT SIZE="1">390</FONT></A>
 in our minds, His leaven in our souls.&#160; His Body became Bread, to quicken our deadness.</p>

 and wrote [His bill], and also became our debtor!&#160; By His yoke He brake from us the chains of him that led us captive.&#160; Glory to the Judge Who was judged, and made His Twelve to sit in judgment on the tribes, and by ignorant men condemned the scribes of that nation!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p19"></A>Glory to Him Who could never be measured by us!&#160; Our heart is too small for Him, yea our mind is too feeble.&#160; He makes foolish our littleness by the riches of His Wisdom.&#160; Glory to Him, Who lowered Himself, and asked;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_391"></A><A HREF="#fn_391"><FONT SIZE="1">392</FONT></A>
 that He might hear and learn that which He knew; that He might by His questions reveal the treasure of His helpful graces!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p21"></A>Let us adore Him Who enlightened with His doctrine our mind, and in our hearing sought a pathway for His words.&#160; Praise we Him Who grafted into our tree His fruit.&#160; Thanks to Him Who sent His Heir, that by Him He might draw us to Himself, yea make us heirs with Him!&#160; Thanks to that Good One, the cause of all goods!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p22"></A>Blessed He Who did not chide, because that He was good!&#160; Blessed He Who did not spurn, because that He was just also!&#160; Blessed He Who was silent, and rebuked; that He might quicken us with both!&#160; Severe His silence and reproachful.&#160; Mild His severity even When He was accusing; for He rebuked the traitor, and kissed the thief.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p23"></A>Glory to the hidden Husbandman of our intellects!&#160; His seed fell on to our ground, and made our mind rich.&#160; His increase came an hundredfold into the treasury of our souls!&#160; Let us adore Him Who sat down and took rest; and walked in the way, so that the Way was in the way, and the Door also for them that go in,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_392"></A><A HREF="#fn_392"><FONT SIZE="1">393</FONT></A>
 by which they go in to the kingdom.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p25"></A>Blessed the Shepherd Who became a Lamb for our reconcilement!&#160; Blessed the Branch Who became the Cup of our Redemption!&#160; Blessed also be the Cluster, Fount of medicine of life!&#160; Blessed also be the Tiller, Who became Wheat, that He might be sown; and a Sheaf,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_393"></A><A HREF="#fn_393"><FONT SIZE="1">394</FONT></A>
 that He might be cut!&#160; [Blessed be] the Architect Who became a Tower for our place of safety!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_394"></A><A HREF="#fn_394"><FONT SIZE="1">395</FONT></A>
&#160; Blessed He Who so tempered the feelings of our mind,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_395"></A><A HREF="#fn_395"><FONT SIZE="1">396</FONT></A>
 that we with our harp should sing that which the winged creatures&#146; mouth knows not with its strains to sing!&#160; Glory to Him, Who beheld how we had pleased to be like to brutes in our rage and our greediness; and came down and was one of us, that we might become heavenly!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p29"></A>Glory be to Him, Who never felt the need of our praising Him; yet felt the need as being kind to us, and thirsted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_396"></A><A HREF="#fn_396"><FONT SIZE="1">397</FONT></A>
 as loving us, and asks us to give to Him, and longs to give to us.&#160; His fruit was mingled with us men, that in Him we might come nigh to Him, Who condescended to us.&#160; By the Fruit of His stem He grafted us into His Tree.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p31"></A>Let us praise Him, Who prevailed and quickened us by His stripes!&#160; Praise we Him, Who took away the curse by His thorns!&#160; Praise we Him Who put death to death by His dying!&#160; Praise we Him, Who held His peace and justified us!&#160; Praise we Him, Who rebuked death that had overcome us!&#160; Blessed He, Whose helpful graces cleansed out the left side!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_397"></A><A HREF="#fn_397"><FONT SIZE="1">398</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p33"></A>Praise we Him Who watched and put to sleep him that led us captive.&#160; Praise we Him Who went to sleep, and chased our deep sleep away.&#160; Glory be to God Who cured weak manhood!&#160; Glory be to Him Who was baptized, and drowned our iniquity <A NAME="page_229"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 229</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.iii-Page_229"></A>in the deep, and choked him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_398"></A><A HREF="#fn_398"><FONT SIZE="1">399</FONT></A>
 that choked us!&#160; Let us glorify with all our mouths the Lord of all creatures!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p35"></A>Blessed be the Physician Who came down and amputated without pain, and healed wounds with a medicine that was not harsh.&#160; His Son became a Medicine, that showed sinners mercy.&#160; Blessed be He Who dwelt in the womb, and wrought therein a perfect Temple, that He might dwell in it, a Throne that He might be in it, a Garment that He might be arrayed in it, and a Weapon that He might conquer in it.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p36"></A>Blessed be He Whom our mouth cannot adequately praise, because His Gift is too great for skill of orators [to tell]; neither can the faculties adequately praise His goodness.&#160; For praise Him as we may, it is too little.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p37"></A>And since it is useless to be silent and to constrain ourselves, may our feebleness excuse such praise as we can sing.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p38"></A>How gracious He, Who demands not more than our strength can give!&#160; How would Thy servant be condemned in capital and interest, did he not give such as he could, and did he refuse that which He owed!&#160; Ocean of glory Who needest not to have Thy glory sung, take in Thy goodness this drop of praise; since by Thy Gift Thou hast supplied my tongue a sense for glorifying Thee.</p>
