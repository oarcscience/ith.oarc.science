<span id="iii.iv.xiii-p2"></span>1.  I will call in my affliction, on
the Power that subdues all;—that is able to subdue, the Captor in his
wrath,—as it overcame Legion.*  R., Glory to His grace!*

<span id="iii.iv.xiii-p3"></span>2.  The Evil One has repaid me my
brethren, debts that he borrowed not of me:—the good *God* likewise has
repaid me, mercies that I lent Him not.—Come and marvel ye at these two
things!

<span id="iii.iv.xiii-p4"></span>3.  The good *God* has divided and
given, my misdeeds to His grace,—my offences to His justice; His mercy
has blotted out my misdeeds—His judgment has requited my offences.

<span id="iii.iv.xiii-p5"></span>4.  Sin was exceeding wroth, and abode
in alarm,—when she saw how grace, put restraint on freedom, that she
might overcome transgressions.

<span id="iii.iv.xiii-p6"></span>5.  Glow Thou, O my Lord, and send down
Thy love, break out and pour forth Thy wrath!—Thy wrath to destroy, Thy
love to rescue—the captives from the captor!

<span id="iii.iv.xiii-p7"></span>6.  The days wherein the Evil One,
decreed to cast me forth,—as with a sling into perdition, in them the
good God has bound up and kept—my soul in the bundle of life.

<span id="iii.iv.xiii-p8"></span>7.  The men of speech who keep not
silence, from praising continually,—who have kept me in the midst of
waves, and supported me that I fell not, let them give praise in my
stead, O my Lord!

<span id="iii.iv.xiii-p9"></span>8.  For who has at any time sufficed,
in presence of the grace,—of the mercies which surrounded him, that I
should suffice to praise—the mercies that encompass me?
