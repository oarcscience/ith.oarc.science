<p class="c37"><a name="iii.iv.viii-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.iv.viii-p1.1"></A>Hymn VII.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.viii-p2"></A>1.&#160; Wrath came to rebuke, the greedy who in the midst of peace, bargained, defrauded and plundered.&#160; In calamity the greedy have waxed rich:&#160; lo! what was theirs they have scattered, what was not theirs they have gathered.&#160; <i>R., Give peace, O Son, to our land!</i></p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.viii-p3"></A>2.&#160; Twenty years my troubles, have been like branches, O my Saviour! which are kept back throughout winter, but when it is time to shoot forth, my troubles shoot forth:&#160; with our fruit our heart ripens.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.viii-p4"></A>3.&#160; Nisan is the time of buds:&#160; in it the <i>ill</i> tidings budded.&#160; When our delights crowded on us, then crowded on us our ills.&#160; At the time of winnowing of wheat, came the winnowing of cities,</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.viii-p5"></A>4.&#160; For the three brethren in Babylon fled not from the fire that men kindled, because they were steadfast:&#160; from lust they fled, because they were perfect.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.viii-p6"></A>5.&#160; The fire of them that have triumphed, is able to turn the black kids into white:&#160; the fire of vain men is able to make the lambs into spotted leopards.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.viii-p7"></A>6.&#160; How great will be my cries, to be cried at any alarm!&#160; How great my indignation to ripen at every ill tidings!&#160; How great my harvests, to perish every mouth!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.viii-p8"></A>7.&#160; For the crimes of my sons He has chastened me, in their struggling for my deliverance.&#160; The people who deliver me, bring chastisement upon me.&#160; Restrain ye your sins, and lo! my chastisements are restrained!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.viii-p9"></A>8.&#160; In ill tidings they are afflicted; in time of wrath they are tortured; in time of peace they are distressed; for when every man breathes freely, and <i>all</i> are unthankful for grace, they render <i>thanks</i> on behalf of every man.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.viii-p10"></A>9.&#160; Their sackcloth <i>is</i> humble for my sake; their ashes <i>are</i> sprinkled in my affliction; their prayer <i>is</i> for my victory; their fast for my deliverance:&#160; Lo! the debt is on my ascetics, the guilt with my nobles.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.viii-p11"></A>10.&#160; Great is in every age, the folly of the wise; the scribes and elders envied and killed the teacher, who taught all people the Law of Moses.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.viii-p12"></A>11.&#160; Wisdom in this age <i>is</i> a possession that brings loss:&#160; he who has a little folly, very small <i>is</i> his guilt; but he who has a little prudence, his iniquity passes measure.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.viii-p13"></A>12.&#160; They build with their words, and overthrow in their deeds; for the teachers were many and foolish, but the mouth of the judge is both of these things, the judge and the accuser.</p>
