<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xxxii-p3"></A>1. I heard Death and Satan, as they disputed, which was the more powerful, among men.&#160; <i>R., To Thee be glory, Son of the Shepherd of All, Who deliveredst His flock from the secret wolves that devoured it</i>, the Evil One and Death!&#8212;2. Death showed his power, that he conquers all; Satan showed his guile, that he makes all to sin.&#8212;3. <i>Death</i>, To thee, O Evil One, none hearkens save he that wills:&#160; to me he that wills and he that wills not, even to me they come.&#8212;4. <i>Satan</i>, Thine, O Death, is but the force of tyranny:&#160; mine are snares and nets of subtlety.&#8212;5. <i>D</i>., Hear, O Evil One, that who so is subtle breaks off thy yoke:&#160; but none is there that is able to escape my yoke.&#8212;6. <i>S</i>., Thou, Death, on him that is sick provest thy might:&#160; but I over them that are whole, am exceeding powerful.&#8212;7. <i>D</i>., The Evil One prevails not over all those that revile him:&#160; but for me he that has cursed me and he that curses me, come into my hands.&#8212;8. <i>S</i>., Thou, Death, from God, hast gotten thy might:&#160; I alone by none am I helped, when I lead <i>men</i> to sin.&#8212;9. <i>D</i>., Thou, O Evil-One, like a weakling:&#160; while like a king I exercise my dominion.&#8212;10. <i>S</i>., Thou art a fool, O Death, not to know how great am I:&#160; who suffice to capture free will, the sovereign power.&#8212;11. <i>D</i>., Thou, O Evil One, like a thief, lo! thou goest round:&#160; I like a lion break in pieces and <A NAME="page_207"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 207</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.xxxii-Page_207"></A>fear not.&#8212;12. <i>S</i>., To thee, O Death, none does service or worship:&#160; to me kings do service of sacrifice as to God.&#8212;13. <i>D</i>., On Death there are many that call, as on a kind Power:&#160; on thee, O Evil One, none has called or calls.&#8212;14. <i>S</i>., Markest thou not this, O Death, how many there are:&#160; who in sundry fashions call on me and make oblation?&#8212;15. <i>D</i>. Hated is thy name, O Satan, nor canst thou clear it:&#160; thy name every one curses, hide thy reproach.&#8212;16. <i>S</i>., Thine ear, O Death, has waxed dull, that thou hearest not:&#160; how against thee all men groan, conceal thyself.&#8212;17. <i>D</i>., My face is shown to the world, for I am guileless:&#160; not like thee who without guile canst not abide.&#8212;18. <i>S</i>., Thou hast not in aught surpassed me for it is true:&#160; that thou art hateful as I to the sons of men.&#8212;19. <i>D</i>., Of me all men are afraid as of a lord:&#160; but as for thee they hate thee as the Evil One.&#8212;20. <i>S</i>., For thee, O Death, they hate thy name, and also thy work:&#160; my name they hate but my delights they greatly love.&#8212;21. <i>D</i>., To bitterness of teeth is turned, this thy sweetness:&#160; penitence of soul cleaves ever unto thy lusts.&#8212;22. <i>S</i>., Sheol is hated because in her is no repentance:&#160; a pit that swallows and closes on all movements.&#8212;23. <i>D</i>., Sheol is a gulf wherein whoso falls shall rise again:&#160; sin is hated because it cuts off the hope of man.&#8212;24. <i>S</i>., Though I mislike penitents, I give place <i>for repentance</i>:&#160; thou cuttest off hope from the sinner who dies in his sin.&#8212;25. <i>D</i>., It was of thee that at first his hope was cut off:&#160; for he whom thou hast not caused to sin dies happily.&#8212;26. Blessed <i>is</i> He who raised against each other those cursed servants:&#160; that we might see them as they have seen us and mocked at us.&#8212;27. This that we have seen of them is a pledge, my brethren:&#160; of what we shall see of them hereafter when we rise again.</p>
