<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xxxiv-p2"></A>1. Hear, O Freedom, the dispute of two servants:&#160; how they are convicted by each other, that they are powerless.&#8212;2. <i>R., To Thee be glory by Whose humiliation Adam was exalted:&#160; and by Whose death he was raised, and regained Eden!</i>&#8212;3. If then the Evil One overcome thee, great is the shame:&#160; Death his comrade has convicted him, as being weak.&#8212;4. And if again Death subdue thee, lo! what reproach:&#160; for the Evil One his comrade derides him, as but a shadow.&#8212;5. Their dispute is for thee a mirror, wherein thou mayest see:&#160; that they both are but as chaff, before thy breath.&#8212;6. Yea and Prophets and Apostles, in their promises:&#160; assure thee that they like flowers, shall fade at the rising.&#8212;7. <i>S</i>., Thou, Death, art he whom they hate, the quick and dead:&#160; for every combination thou dissolvest, and destroyest.&#8212;8. <i>D</i>., It is not open death that kills, O Satan:&#160; thy death which is secret kills the sons of men.&#8212;9. <i>S</i>., My name is not hateful as thine, for the angel:&#160; showed himself in Satan&#146;s likeness to Balaam on the way.&#8212;10. <i>D</i>., How fit is this thy name, O Satan:&#160; who hast erred and made unwary Adam err, from the way!&#8212;11. <i>S</i>., Wander not like one ignorant, and lose thy cause:&#160; dispute, O Death, if thou are competent, for replying.&#8212;12.<i>D</i>., I know that thou art wily, O Satan:&#160; so that thou out of sand canst twist a snare.&#8212;13. <i>S</i>., Thy disputing, Death, is ended:&#160; for he who is worsted:&#160; when his words fail and are ended, begins to rail.&#8212;14. <i>D</i>., Among all I am conqueror, and by thee am I worsted?&#160; Let Adam persuade thee whom I have overcome, O Satan!&#8212;15. <i>S</i>., I am he who bound Adam, and cast him before thee:&#160; the mighty man whom my wiles had bound, thou didst come and subdue.&#8212;16. <i>D</i>., I am he who have been crowned anew, with a diadem in the world:&#160; for Adam, chief of the mighty, I hold captive in Sheol.&#8212;17. <i>S</i>., I killed him by secret death, even Adam when he sinned:&#160; thou, Death, hast slain one that was dead, killed by me.&#8212;18. <i>D</i>., In thy desire to conquer, Evil One, thou hast made thyself hated:&#160; for thou art Death as well as Satan, and this <i>seems</i> a little thing to thee.&#8212;19. <i>S</i>., Thou hast then been silenced, Death, as a weakling:&#160; for neither in words nor in deeds, hast thou strength to stand.&#8212;20. <i>D</i>., It is for thy evil thou conquerest, O Evil One, if thou discernest:&#160; thy crown is wholly of shame, if thou perceivest.&#8212;21. I shall be defeated and thou shalt be cursed, O Satan:&#160; it is well for me to be ignorant, and not mischievous.&#8212;22. Blessed be the Just One who divided them, though they were quite of one mind:&#160; Blessed be the Good One who made us of one mind, when we were divided.&#8212;23. I will overcome the Evil One through Thy forgiveness, O All-Merciful:&#160; and I shall overcome death through Thy Resurrection, O All-Life-giver!</p>
