id="iii.vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Hymn XIII.</span>

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.vi.xiv-p2.1"></span>Hymn of the Baptized.</span>

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p3"></span>(<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.vi.xiv-p3.1"></span>Resp</span>.—*Brethren, sing praises, to the
Son of the Lord of all; Who has bound for you crowns, such as kings long
for!*)

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p4"></span>1.  Your garments glisten, my brethren,
as snow;—and fair is your shining in the likeness of Angels!

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p5"></span>2.  In the likeness of Angels, ye have
come up, beloved,—from Jordan’s river, in the armour of the Holy Ghost.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p6"></span>3.  The bridal chamber that fails not,
my brethren, ye have received:—and the glory of Adam’s house to-day ye
have put on.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p7"></span>4.  The judgment that *came* of the
fruit, was Adam’s condemnation:—but for you victory, has arisen this
day.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p8"></span>5.  Your vesture is shining, and goodly
your crowns:—which the Firstborn has bound for you, by the priest’s hand
this day.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p9"></span>6.  Woe in Paradise, did Adam
receive:—but you have received, glory this day.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p10"></span>7.  The armour of victory, ye put on,
my beloved:—in the hour when the priest, invoked the Holy Ghost.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p11"></span>8.  The Angels rejoice, men here below
exult:—in your feast, my brethren, wherein is no foulness.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p12"></span>9.  The good things of Heaven, my
brethren, ye have received:—beware of the Evil One, lest he despoil you.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p13"></span>10.  The day when He dawned, the
Heavenly King:—opens for you His door, and bids you enter Eden.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p14"></span>11.  Crowns that fade not away, are set
on your heads:—hymns of praise hourly, let your mouths sing.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p15"></span>12.  Adam by means of the fruit, *God*
cast forth in sorrow:—but you He makes glad, in the bride-chamber of
joy.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p16"></span>13.  Who would not rejoice, in your
bridechamber, my brethren?—for the Father with His Son, and the Spirit
rejoice in you.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p17"></span>14.  Unto you shall the Father, be a
wall of strength:—and the Son a Redeemer, and the Spirit a guard.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p18"></span>15.  Martyrs by their blood, glorify
their crowns:—but you our Redeemer, by His Blood glorifies.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p19"></span>16.  Watchers and Angels, joy over the
repentant:—they shall joy over you my brethren, that unto them ye are
made like.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p20"></span>17.  The fruit which Adam, tasted not
in Paradise:—this day in your mouths, has been placed with joy.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p21"></span>18.  Our Redeemer figured, His Body by
the tree:—whereof Adam tasted not, because he had sinned.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p22"></span>19.  The Evil One made war, and subdued
Adam’s house:—through your baptism, my brethren, lo! he is subdued this
day.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p23"></span>20.  Great is the victory, but to-day
you have won:—if so be ye neglect not, you shall not perish, my
brethren.

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p24"></span>21.  Glory to them that are robed,
glory to Adam’s house!—in the birth that *is* from the water, let them
rejoice and be blessed!

<span id="iii.vi.xiv-p25"></span>22.  Praise to Him Who has robed, His
Churches in glory!—glory to Him Who has magnified, the race of Adam’s
house.
