<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.iv-p2"></A>(<span class="sc"><a name="iii.vi.iv-p2.1"></A>Resp</span>.&#8212;<i>Christ with chrism, lo! He is sealing the newborn lambs in His flock!</i>)</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.iv-p3"></A>1.&#160; Christ and chrism are conjoined; the secret with the visible is mingled:&#160; the chrism anoints visibly,&#8212;Christ seals secretly, the lambs newborn and spiritual, the prize of His twofold victory; for He engendered it of the chrism, and He gave it birth of the water.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p4"></A>2.&#160; How exalted are your Orders!&#160; For she that was a sinner anointed, as a handmaid, the feet of her Lord.&#160; <i>But</i> for you, as though <i>His</i> minister, Christ by the hand of His servants, seals and anoints your bodies.&#160; It befits Him the Lord of the flock, that in His own person He seal His sheep.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p5"></A>3.&#160; Since then she, that sinner, stood in need of forgiveness, the anointing was for her an offering, and by it her love reconciled her Lord.&#160; But you who are the flock, among the profane and unbelievers, the Truth by the chrism is your seal, to separate you from the strayed.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p6"></A>4.&#160; From the peoples he separated the People, by the former seal of circumcision; but by the seal of anointing, the peoples He separates from the People.&#160; When the peoples were in error, the People He separated from the peoples; now when the People has erred from Him, He separates the peoples from thence.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p7"></A>5.&#160; Of the dust of the pure soil, Naaman bore away and returned to his place; that he by this holy dust, might be separated and known from the unclean.&#160; The chrism of Christ separates, the sons of the mystery from strangers:&#160; and by it they that are within are separated, and known from them that are without.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p8"></A>6.&#160; The oil which Elijah multiplied, might be tasted with the mouth; for the cruse was that of the widow, it was not that of the chrism.&#160; The oil of our Lord that is in the cruse, it is not food for the mouth:&#160; the sinner <i>that was</i> a wolf without, it makes him a lamb in the flock.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p9"></A>7.&#160; The chrism of the meek and lowly One, changes the stubborn <i>to be</i> like its Lord.&#160; The Gentiles were wolves and feared, the severe rod of Moses.&#160; Lo! the chrism seals <i>them</i> and makes, a flock of sheep out of the wolves!&#160; And the wolves that had fled from the rod, lo! they have taken refuge in the Cross!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p10"></A>8.&#160; The leaf of olive arrived, brought as a figure of the anointing; the sons of the Ark rejoiced to greet it, for it bore good tidings of deliverance.&#160; Thus also ye rejoiced to greet it, even this holy anointing.&#160; The bodies of sinners were glad in it, for it brought good tidings of deliverance.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p11"></A>9.&#160; The oil again that Jacob poured, upon the stone when he sealed it, that it should be between him and God, and that he might offer there his tithes; lo! in it is a symbol of your bodies, <i>how</i> by chrism they are sealed <i>as</i> holy, and become temples for God, where He shall be served by your sacrifices.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p12"></A>10.&#160; When Moses had sealed and anointed, the sons of Aaron the Levite, the fire consumed their bodies; the fire spared their vestments.&#160; But ye my brethren blessed are ye, for the fire of grace has come down, has consumed utterly your offences, and cleansed and hallowed your bodies!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p13"></A>11.&#160; As for the anointing of Aaron my brethren, it was the vile blood of beasts, <i>that</i> it sprinkled in the horns of the altar.&#160; The anointing of truth is this; wherein the living and all-lifegiving Blood, is sprinkled inwardly in your bodies, is mingled in your understandings, is infused through your inmost chambers.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p14"></A>12.&#160; The anointed priests used to offer, the slain bodies of beasts; Ye, O anointed <A NAME="page_270"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 270</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vi.iv-Page_270"></A>and excelling, your offerings <i>are</i> your <i>own</i> bodies.&#160; The anointed Levites offered, the inward parts <i>taken</i>, from beasts:&#160; ye have excelled the Levites, for your hearts ye have Consecrated.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p15"></A>13.&#160; The anointing of the People was&#8212;a foreshadowing of Christ; their rod a mystery of the Cross; their lamb a type of the Only begotten; their tabernacle a mystery of your Churches; their circumcision a sign of your sealing.&#160; Under the shadow of your goodly thing, sat the People of old.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p16"></A>14.&#160; Thus the truth is likened, to a great shadowing tree:&#160; it cast its shade on the People; it struck its root among the peoples.&#160; The People abode under its shadows, whose shadows were its mysteries; but the Gentiles lodged on its bough, and plucked and ate of its fruits.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p17"></A>15.&#160; As <i>for</i> the anointing of Saul to be king; the sweeter was its savour, so much fouler was the savour of his heart.&#160; The Spirit struck him and fled.&#160; Your anointing which ye have is greater; for your minds are censers, in your temples the Spirit exults, a chamber forever shall ye be unto Him.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p18"></A>16.&#160; As <i>for</i> the anointing of David my brethren; the Spirit came down and made sweet savour, in the heart of the man wherein He delighted; the savour of his heart <i>was</i> as the savour of his action.&#160; The Spirit dwelt in him and made song in him.&#160; Your anointing which ye have is greater, for Father and Son and Holy Ghost, have moved and come down to dwell in you.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p19"></A>17.&#160; When the leper of old was cleansed, the priest used to seal him with oil, and to lead him to the waterspring.&#160; The type has passed and the truth is come; lo! with chrism have ye been sealed, in baptism ye are perfected, in the flock ye are intermixed, from the Body ye are nourished.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p20"></A>18.&#160; What leper when he has been cleansed, turns again and desires his leprosy?&#160; Ye have put off transgressions&#8212;forsake it!&#160; None puts on the leprosy he had put off.&#160; It has fallen and sunk&#8212;let it not be drawn out!&#160; It is wasted and worn&#8212;let it not be renewed!&#160; Let not corruption come out upon you, whom the chrism of Christ has anointed!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p21"></A>19.&#160; The vessel moulded of clay, gains beauty from the water, receives strength from the fire; <i>but</i> if it slips it is ruined, it cannot be afresh renewed.&#160; Ye are vessels of grace; be ye ware of it, even of justice, for it grants not two renewals.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p22"></A>20.&#160; How like are ye in comparison, with the Prophet whom the fish yielded up!&#160; The Devourer has given you back for he was constrained, by the Power Which constrained the fish.&#160; Jonah was for you <i>as</i> a mirror, since not again did the fish swallow him, let not again the Devourer swallow you:&#160; being yielded up be ye like Jonah!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p23"></A>21.&#160; Goodly ointment on the head of our Lord did Mary pour; its savour was fragrant through all the house.&#160; Likewise the savour of your anointing, has been fragrant and perfumed the heavens, to the Watchers on high; doing pleasure to Satan its savour <i>is</i> overpowering; to God its odour <i>is</i> sweet.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p24"></A>22.&#160; The crowds in the desert were like unto sheep that have no shepherd.&#160; The Merciful became their shepherd, and multiplied to them the pasture of bread.&#160; Yea, blessed <i>are</i> ye that are perfect, that are sealed <i>as</i> lambs of Christ, that of His Body and Blood are made worthy; the Pastor Himself is become pasture for you!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p25"></A>23.&#160; Out of water He made the wine, He gave <i>it</i> for drink to the youths in the feast.&#160; For you who are keeping the fast, better is the unction than drink.&#160; In His wine the betrothed are wedded, by His oil the wedded are sanctified.&#160; By His wine <i>is</i> union; by His oil sanctification.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p26"></A>24.&#160; The sheep of Christ leaped for joy, to receive the seal of life, that ensign of <A NAME="page_271"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 271</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vi.iv-Page_271"></A>kings which has ever put sin to flight.&#160; The Wicked by Thy ensign is routed, iniquities by Thy sign are scattered.&#160; Come, ye sheep, receive your seal, which puts to flight them that devour you!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p27"></A>25.&#160; Come, ye lambs, receive your seal, for it is truth that is your seal!&#160; This is the seal that separates, them of the household from strangers.&#160; The steel circumcised alike, the gainsayers and the sons of Hagar.&#160; If circumcision <i>be</i> the sign of the sheep, lo! by it the goats are signed.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p28"></A>26.&#160; But ye, <i>who are</i> the new flock, have put off the doings of wolves, and <i>as</i> lambs are made like to the Lamb.&#160; One by changing has changed all; the Lamb to the wolves gave Himself to be slain; <i>the wolves</i> rushed and devoured Him and became lambs; for the Shepherd was changed into a Lamb; likewise the wolf forgot his nature.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p29"></A>27.&#160; Look on me also in Thy mercy! be not branded on me the seal, of the goats the sons of the left hand! let not Thy sheep become a goat!&#160; For though to justify myself I sufficed not, yet to be a sinner I willed not.&#160; Turn <i>thine eyes</i>, O my Lord, from what I have done, and seek not only what I have willed.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p30"></A>28.&#160; From them that write and them that preach, from them that hear and them that are sealed, let glory go up to Christ, and through Him to His Father <i>be</i> exaltation!&#160; He Who gives words to them that speak, and gives voice to them that preach, has given understanding to them that hear, and consecrates chrism for him that is sealed.</p>
