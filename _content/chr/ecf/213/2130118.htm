<p><a name="ii.vii.xxxvi-p5"></A>Since the departure of our congregation, <A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A> <a name="ii.vii.xxxvi-Page_85"></A>which is with thee, we have been in a state of great suspense from having heard nothing of the success of your journey.&#160; But when Almighty God shall have brought you to our most reverend brother the bishop Augustine, tell him that I have long been considering with myself about the case of the Angli; to wit, that the temples of idols in that nation should not be destroyed, but that the idols themselves that are in them should be.&#160; Let blessed water be prepared, and sprinkled in these temples, and altars constructed, and relics deposited, since, if these same temples are well built, it is needful that they should be transferred from the worship of idols to the service of the true God; that, when the people themselves see that these temples are not destroyed, they may put away error from their heart, and, knowing and adoring the true God, may have recourse with the more familiarity to the places they have been accustomed to.&#160; And, since they are wont to kill many oxen in sacrifice to demons, they should have also some solemnity of this kind in a changed form, so that on the day of dedication, or on the anniversaries of the holy martyrs whose relics are deposited there, they may make for themselves tents of the branches of trees around these temples that have been changed into churches, and celebrate the solemnity with religious feasts.&#160; Nor let them any longer sacrifice animals to the devil, but slay animals to the praise of God for their own eating, and return thanks to the Giver of all for their fulness, so that, while some joys are reserved to them outwardly, they may be able the more easily to incline their minds to inward joys.&#160; For it is undoubtedly impossible to cut away everything at once from hard hearts, since one who strives to ascend to the highest place must needs rise by steps or paces, and not by leaps.&#160; Thus to the people of Israel in Egypt the Lord did indeed make Himself known; but still He reserved to them in His own worship the use of the sacrifices which they were accustomed to offer to the devil, enjoining them to immolate animals in sacrifice to Himself; to the end that, their hearts being changed, they should omit some things in the sacrifice and retain others, so that, though the animals were the same as what they had been accustomed to offer, nevertheless, as they immolated them to God and not to idols, they should be no longer the same sacrifices.&#160; This then it is necessary for thy Love to say to our aforesaid brother, that he, being now in that country, may consider well how he should arrange all things.&#160; God keep thee safe, most beloved son.&#160; Given this 15th day of the Kalends of July, the 19th year of the empire of our most pious lord Mauricius Tiberius Augustus, the 18th year after the consulship of the same our lord, Indiction 4.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ii.vii.xxxvi-p4"></A> This letter was sent after the departure of Mellitus with the band of new missionaries from Rome to Britain (see <i>Prolegomena</i>, p. xxvi.), being intended to reach him while still in France.&#160; In the date given at the end there is evidently an error with regard to the day of the month.&#160; For several of the letters sent by Mellitus being dated 10 Kal. Jul. (i.e. June 22), this, which was subsequent, cannot have been originally dated xv Kal. Jul. (i.e. June 17).&#160; The Indiction is given correctly.&#160; Gregory had directed King Ethelbert (XI. 66) to destroy the heathen temples.&#160; He now sees reason to modify any such orders.</p>
