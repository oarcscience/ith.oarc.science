id="iii.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Hymn IX.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.x-p2"></span>…My afflictions are as Job’s.  Thy justice
delivered him; let Thy grace have mercy on me!

<span id="iii.iv.x-p3"></span>2.  In these two things is profit; that
neither should the just, be weary in supplication, nor should the
rebellious, multiply transgression.

<span id="iii.iv.x-p4"></span>3.  With the sons Thou labourest, to
chastise and help *them*; and that the fathers should not be grieved, by
the sound of the scourge, they left me in peace.

<span id="iii.iv.x-p5"></span>4.  Look, O my Lord, on my woods without,
how they have been cut down! behold, O my Lord, my breasts within, that
they are *too* weak, for me to bear my beloved ones!

<span id="iii.iv.x-p6"></span>5.  With swords they have cut off, my
wings that are without; again the fire kindles, in my bosom within, the
incense of burnt offering.

<span id="iii.iv.x-p7"></span>6.  The sun-worshippers have killed, my
sons in the plain:  and they that offer to Baal, have sacrificed my
bulls in the city, my sheep with my babes.

<span id="iii.iv.x-p8"></span>7.  In my fields is lamentation; in my
halls wailing; in my vineyards terror; in my streets confusion.  Who can
suffice for me?

<span id="iii.iv.x-p9"></span>8.  The Evil One who dealt treacherously,
and disturbed me with his words, stirred up trouble within, so that my
inward part, is wholly as my outward part.

<span id="iii.iv.x-p10"></span>9.  With what face, O my Lord, shall I
call on Thee to send, a camp of holy ones, to guard my bosom, which is
full of uncleanness?

<span id="iii.iv.x-p11"></span>10.  With Thy new leaven, Thou hast
chastened creation.  Make Thou the old leaven, which ensnares and
humbles, to be like the new leaven!

<span id="iii.iv.x-p12"></span>11.  By the manifest striving, of Thy
power let us conquer; lest error should crown, those that strive for
Thee, cleaving *to them* with blandishment!

<span id="iii.iv.x-p13"></span>12.  If we look into our time, it is like
our deceit; <span id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349) —for in the years of
truthfulness, we practised divinations,—and secretly used enchantments.

<span id="iii.iv.x-p15"></span>13.  If I look into the time, it provokes
and into light,—brings secret things, that our deceit may be
shamed,—which wore the raiment of Truth.

<span id="iii.iv.x-p16"></span>14.  Verily it is truth, that overcomes
all; <span id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350) —and the sea with its
bitterness, cannot trouble it,—for it is pure in its nature.

<span id="iii.iv.x-p18"></span>15.  In wisdom Thou hast made it, O my
Lord, that it has laid bare our lust.—That the foolish should come to
nought, and should not be encouraged,—*Truth* has withheld the crown.

<span id="iii.iv.x-p19"></span>16.  On the tottering walls, whereon Thou
hast given me victory,—the unthankful repay Thee, with sacrifice and
libation, which provoke Thee openly.

<span id="iii.iv.x-p20"></span>17.  If it were at that time, sacrifices
had been offered;—there had been room even, for delusion to
suppose,—that in these I was delivered.

<span id="iii.iv.x-p21"></span>18.  Through the multitude of
deliverances, Thou hast rebuked two things:—the delusion of graven
images, and the teaching of magicians;—for in Thee, O my Lord, have I
been delivered!
