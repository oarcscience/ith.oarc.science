<p><a name="iii.v.xix-p4"></A>2.&#160; <i>Blessed art</i> thou, O Church, that in thy festivals,&#8212;the Watchers rejoice amid thy festivity!&#8212;for one night the Watchers gave praise,&#8212;on the earth which withheld and refused praise.&#8212;<i>Blessed</i> thy voices that have been sown and reaped,&#8212;and in Heaven stored up in garners!&#8212;Thy mouth is a censer, and thy voices as perfumes, breathing vapour in thy festivals.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xix-p5"></A>3.&#160; <i>Blessed art</i> thou, O Church, that all oblations,&#8212;are brought unto thee in this feast.&#8212;The Magi once among traitors, offered them to the Truth.&#8212;<i>Blessed</i> thy abode that He bowed Himself and dwelt therein, Son of the King Who is worshipped with gifts!&#8212;Gold from the West, and spices from the East,&#8212;are offered in Thy Festivals.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xix-p6"></A>4.&#160; <i>Blessed art</i> thou, O Church, that there is not with thee,&#8212;a tyrant King slayer of babes! for he killed in Bethlehem the little ones at random,&#8212;that he might put to death the Child that gives life to all.&#8212;<i>Blessed</i> thy children that are envied and worshipped,&#8212;by Kings, for those are promised for Thy worship,&#8212;the crowns of the East:&#8212;he who trod down thy dear ones, shall be trodden down by thy beloved.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xix-p7"></A>5.&#160; <i>Blessed art</i> thou, O Church, for lo! over thee,&#8212;Isaiah too exults in his prophecy,&#8212;&#8221;Lo a Virgin shall conceive and bear,&#8212;a Son&#8221; Whose name is great mystery!&#8212;O interpretation revealed in the Church!&#8212;two names that were joined and became one;&#8212;&#8221;Emmanuel,&#8221;&#8212;God be with thee ever, Who joined thee with His members!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xix-p8"></A>6.&#160; <i>Blessed art</i> thou, O Church, in Micah who cried out,&#8212;&#8220;A Shepherd shall come forth from Ephrata&#8221;:&#8212;for He came to Bethlehem to take&#8212;from thence the rod of Jesse and to rule the nations.&#8212;<i>Blessed</i> thy lambs that are sealed with His seal,&#8212;and thy sheep that are kept by His sword!&#8212;Thou art, O Church,&#8212;the abiding Bethlehem,&#8212;for in thee is the Bread of Life!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_506"></A><A HREF="#fn_506"><FONT SIZE="1">507</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iii.v.xix-p11"></A>8.&#160; <i>Blessed art</i> thou, O Church, for on thy, lute, lo! King David sings psalms in thee!&#160; In the Spirit he sings of Him &#8220;Thou <i>art</i> My Son and I&#8212;this day have begotten Thee&#8221; in the glories of holiness.&#8212;<i>Blessed</i> thy ears that have been purged to hear!&#8212;On His day watch thou as His Body and call on Him;&#8212;be taught by Sion,&#8212;which saddened His Feast; make Him glad Who has gladdened thee.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xix-p12"></A>9.&#160; <i>Blessed art</i> thou, O Church, that all festivals&#8212;have taken flight from Sion and sheltered with thee!&#8212;In the midst of thee the wearied Prophets have found rest,&#8212;from the labour and the reproach<i>they bore</i> in Judah.&#8212;<i>Blessed</i> the books unrolled in thy temples,&#8212;and the festivals celebrated in thy shrines!&#8212;Sion <i>is</i> forsaken,&#8212;and lo! today the nations shout in thy festivals.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xix-p13"></A>10.&#160; <i>Blessed art</i> thou, O Church, in ten blessings,&#8212;which our Lord has given <i>as</i> a mystery complete:&#8212;for on ten all the numbers hang, therefore art thou perfect by ten blessings.&#8212;Blessed thy crowns that are twined&#8212;with all blessings mixed in every crown!&#8212;O blessed one,&#8212;with every blessing crowned, on me too send thy blessing!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xix-p14"></A>11.&#160; <i>Blessed art</i> thou, Ephrata, mother of Kings, that from thee sprang the Lord of diadems!&#8212;Micah gave thee tidings that He is from everlasting, and the span of His times is not comprehended.&#8212;Blessed thine eyes which first of all discerned Him!&#8212;thee He deemed worthy to see Him when He appeared,&#8212;Chief of benediction,&#8212;and Beginning of gladness, thou didst receive first of all.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xix-p15"></A>12.&#160; Blessed <i>art</i> thou, Bethlehem, that the towns envy thee,&#8212;and the fortified cities!&#8212;As they <i>envy</i> thee, <i>so</i> the women envy Mary,&#8212;and the virgins daughters of princes.&#8212;Blessed the maiden in whom He deigned to abide,&#8212;and the city wherein He deigned to sojourn;&#8212;a poor maiden,&#8212;and a small city, He chose Him to humble Himself.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xix-p16"></A>13.&#160; Blessed <i>art</i> thou, Bethlehem, that in thee was the beginning,&#8212;for Him the Son Who from everlasting is in the Father!&#8212;It is hard to comprehend, that before Time He is,&#8212;Who in thee made Himself subject to Time.&#8212;Blessed thine ears, for in thee first was heard the cry&#8212;of the Lamb of God who exulted in thee!&#8212;Narrow though thy manger,&#8212;He spread Himself on all sides, and was worshipped of every creature.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xix-p17"></A>14.&#160; Blessed <i>art</i> thou too, Mary, that thy name&#8212;is great and exalted because of thy child!&#8212;Thou canst tell then how and how long&#8212;and where He dwelt in thee, the great One in small room.&#8212;Blessed thy mouth that praised and enquired not,&#8212;and thy tongue that glorified and questioned not!&#8212;For His Mother was uncertain concerning Him,&#8212;even while she carried Him <i>in the womb</i>; who then shall suffice <i>to comprehend</i> Him?</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xix-p18"></A>15.&#160; O Woman, thou whom no man knew,&#8212;how can we behold the Son thou hast borne?&#8212;For no eyes suffice to stand&#8212;before the transfigurations of the glory, that is on Him.&#8212;For tongues of fire abide in Him&#8212;Who sent tongues by His Ascension.&#8212;Be every tongue warned,&#8212;that our questioning is <i>as</i> stubble, and <i>as</i> fire our scrutiny.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xix-p19"></A>16.&#160; Blessed <i>is</i> he the priest who in the sanctuary,&#8212;offers to the Father the Son of the Father,&#8212;the fruit that is plucked from our tree, though it be wholly of the <i>Divine</i> Majesty!&#8212;Blessed the hands that are hallowed and offer Him!&#8212;and the lips that are spent in kissing Him!&#8212;The Spirit in the Temple&#8212;longed for His embrace; and at His Crucifixion rent <i>the veil</i> and went forth.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xix-p20"></A>17.&#160; The Archangel gave thee greeting,&#8212;as the earnest of holiness&#8212;Earth became to him new Heavens,&#8212;when the Watcher came down and sang glory on it.&#8212;The sons <A NAME="page_261"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 261</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.xix-Page_261"></A>of the Highest encompassed thy habitation&#8212;because of the Son of the King that dwelt in thee.&#8212;Thy abode below,&#8212;to the Heaven above was made like by the host of Watchers.</p>
