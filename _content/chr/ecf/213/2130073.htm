<p class="c23"><a name="ii.vi.vi-p3"></A>Gregory to Fortunatus, &amp;c.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vi.vi-p4"></A>When your Fraternity pays too little attention to the monasteries that are under you, you both lay yourself open to reproof, and make us sorry for your laxity.&#160; Now it has come to our ears that one Mauricius, who lately became a monk in the monastery of Barbacianus, has fled from the same monastery, taking other monks with him.&#160; In this case the hastiness of the aforesaid Barbacianus inculpates him exceedingly in our sight, in that he rashly tonsured a secular person without even previous probation.&#160; Did we not write to you that you should prove him first, and then, if he were fit, should make him abbot?&#160; Even now, then, look well after him whom you chose.&#160; For you are delinquent in his delinquency, if he has begun so to demean himself as to shew himself unfit to have the government of brethren.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vi.vi-p5"></A>Further, let your Fraternity more strictly interdict all monasteries from venturing by any means to tonsure those whom they may have received for monastic profession before <A NAME="page_45"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 45</FONT></A> <a name="ii.vi.vi-Page_45"></A>they have completed two years in monastic life.&#160; But in this space of time let their life and manners be carefully proved, lest any one of them should either not be content with what he had desired or not keep firm to what he had chosen.&#160; For, it being a serious matter that untried men should be associated under obedience to any master, how much more serious is it that any who have not been proved should be attached to the service of God?</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vi.vi-p6"></A>Further, if a soldier should wish to become a monk, let no one for any cause whatever presume to receive him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">110</FONT></A>
 without our consent, or before it has been reported to us.&#160; If this rule is not diligently observed, know that all the guilt of those that are under thee redounds on thyself, seeing that thou provest thyself by the very facts of the case to be too little anxious about them.</p>
