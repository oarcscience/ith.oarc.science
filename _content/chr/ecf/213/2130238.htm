<p class="c16"><a name="iii.v.xiii-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.v.xiii-p1.1"></A>Hymn XII.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.v.xiii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.xiii-p2.1"></A>The</span> Babe that I carry carries me, saith Mary, and He has lowered His wings, and taken and placed me between His pinions, and mounted into the air; and a promise has been given me that height and depth shall be my Son&#146;s.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p3"></A>I have seen Gabriel that called him Lord, and the high priest the aged servant, that carried Him and bare Him.&#160; I have seen the Magi when they bowed down, and Herod when he was troubled because the King had come.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p4"></A>Satan also who strangled the little ones that Moses might perish,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_480"></A><A HREF="#fn_480"><FONT SIZE="1">481</FONT></A>
 murdered the little ones that the Living One might die.&#160; To Egypt He fled, Who came to Judea that He might labour and wander there:&#160; he sought to catch the man that would catch himself.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p6"></A>In her virginity Eve put on the leaves of shame:&#160; Thy Mother put on in her Virginity the garment of Glory that suffices for all.&#160; She gave the little vest of the Body to Him that covers all.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p7"></A>Blessed is she in whose heart and mind Thou wast!&#160; A King&#146;s palace she was by Thee, O Son of the King, and a Holy of Holies by Thee, O High Priest!&#160; She had not the trouble nor vexation of a family, or a husband!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p8"></A>Eve, again, was a nest and a den for the accursed serpent, that entered in and dwelt in her.&#160; His evil counsel became bread to her that she might become dust.&#160; Thou art our Bread, and Thou art also [of] our race and our garment of glory.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p9"></A>He that has sanctity, if he be in danger, lo! here is his Guardian!&#160; He that has iniquity, lo! here is his Pardoner!&#160; He that has a devil, here is the Pursuer thereof!&#160; They that have pains, lo! here is the Binder up of their breaches.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p10"></A>He that has a child, let him come and become a brother to my Well-beloved!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_481"></A><A HREF="#fn_481"><FONT SIZE="1">482</FONT></A>
&#160; He that has a daughter or a young woman of his race, let her come and become the bride of my Glorious One!&#160; He that has a servant, let him set him free, that he may come and serve his Lord.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p12"></A>The son of free men that bears Thy yoke, my Son, shall have one reward; and the slave that bears the burden of the yoke of two masters, of Him above and of Him below, there are two blessings for him, and two rewards of the two burdens.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_482"></A><A HREF="#fn_482"><FONT SIZE="1">483</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p14"></A>The free woman, my Son, is Thy handmaid:&#160; also if she who is in bondage serve Thee, in Thee she is free:&#160; in Thee she shall be comforted, because she is freed; hidden apples in her bosom are stored up,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_483"></A><A HREF="#fn_483"><FONT SIZE="1">484</FONT></A>
 if she love Thee!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p16"></A><A NAME="page_247"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 247</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.xiii-Page_247"></A>O chaste woman, long ye for my Well-beloved, that He may dwell in you; and ye also that are impure that He may sanctify you! ye Churches also, that the Son of the Creator Who came to renew all creatures, may adorn you!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p17"></A>He received the foolish who worshipped and served all the stars; He renewed the earth which was worn out through Adam, who sinned and waxed old.&#160; The new formation was the creature of its Renewer, and the all-sufficient One repaired the bodies along with their wills.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p18"></A>Come ye blind, and without money receive lights!&#160; Come ye lame, and receive your feet! ye deaf and dumb, receive your voice! come thou also whose hand is cut off; the maimed also shall receive his hands.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p19"></A>It is the Son of the Creator Whose treasure-houses are filled with all manner of helps.&#160; Let him that is without eyeballs come to Him that makes clay and changes it, that makes flesh, that enlightens eyes.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p20"></A>By the small portion of clay He shows that it was with His hand that Adam was formed:&#160; the soul of the dead also bears Him witness, that by Him it was that the breath of man was breathed in; by the last witnesses He was accredited to be the Son of Him Who is the First.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p21"></A>Gather ye together and come, O ye lepers, and receive purification without labour.&#160; For He will not wash you as Elisha, who baptized seven times in the river:&#160; neither will He trouble you as the priests did with their sprinklings.&#160; Foreigners and also strangers have betaken themselves to the Great Physician.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p22"></A>The rank of strangers hath no place with the King&#146;s Son; the Lord makes not Himself strange to His servants, [or conceal] that He is Lord of all.&#160; For if the Just makes the body leprous, and Thou purifiest it; then, the Former of the body hateth the body; but Thou lovest it.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.v.xiii-p23"></A>And if it be not Thy forming, being Just, Thou wouldest not have healed it;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_484"></A><A HREF="#fn_484"><FONT SIZE="1">485</FONT></A>
 and if it were not Thy creature, when in health, Thou wouldest not have afflicted it.&#160; The punishments that Thou has cast upon it, and the pains which Thou hast healed, proclaim that Thou art the Creator&#146;s Son.</p>
