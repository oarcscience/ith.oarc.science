<span id="iii.v.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Hymn VII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii-p2.1"></span>The</span> Son of the Maker is like unto His
Father as Maker!  He made Himself a pure body, He clothed Himself with
it, and came forth and clothed our weakness with glory, which in His
mercy He brought from the Father.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p3"></span>From Melchizedek, the High Priest, a
hyssop came to Thee, a throne and crown from the house of David, a race
and family from Abraham.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p4"></span>Be thou unto me a Haven, for Thine own
sake, O great Sea.  Lo! the Psalms of David Thy Father, and the words
also of the Prophets, came forth unto me, as it were ships.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p5"></span>David Thy father, in the hundred and
tenth Psalm, twined together two numbers as it were crowns to Thee, and
came \[to Thee\], O Conqueror!  With these shalt Thou be crowned, and
unto the throne shalt Thou ascend and sit.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p6"></span>A great crown is the number that is
twined in the hundred, wherein is crowned Thy Godhead!  A little crown
is that of the number ten, which crowns the Head of Thy Manhood, O
Victorious One!

<span id="iii.v.viii-p7"></span>For Thy sake women sought after men. 
Tamar desired him that was widowed, and Ruth loved a man that was old,
yea, that Rahab, that led men captive, was captivated by Thee.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p8"></span>Tamar went forth, and in the
darkness <span id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457) stole the Light, and in
uncleanness stole the Holy One, and by uncovering her nakedness she went
in and stole Thee, O glorious One, that bringest the pure out of the
impure.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p10"></span>Satan saw her and trembled, and hasted
to trouble her.  He brought the judgment to her mind, and she feared
not; stoning and the sword, and she trembled not.  He that teacheth
adultery hindered adultery, because he was a hinderer of Thee.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p11"></span>For holy was the adultery of Tamar, for
Thy sake.  Thee it was she thirsted after, O pure Fountain.  Judah
defrauded her of drinking Thee.  The thirsty womb stole a dew-draught of
Thee from the spring thereof.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p12"></span>She was a widow for Thy sake.  Thee did
she long for, she hasted and was also an harlot for Thy sake.  Thee did
she vehemently desire, and was sanctified in that it was Thee she loved.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p13"></span>May Tamar rejoice that her Lord hath
come and hath made her name known for the son of her adultery!  Surely
the name she gave him <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458) was
calling unto Thee to come to her.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p15"></span>For Thee honorable women shamed
themselves, Thou that givest chastity to all!  Thee she stole away in
the midst of the ways, who pavest the way into the kingdom!  Because it
was life that she stole, the sword was not able to put her to death.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p16"></span>Ruth lay down by a man in the
threshingfloor for Thy sake; her love made her bold for Thy sake, O Thou
that teachest all penitents boldness.  Her ears refused \[to listen to\]
any voices for the sake of Thy voice.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p17"></span>The live coal that glowed went up into
the bed, of Boaz, lay down there, saw the High Priest, in whose loins
was hidden a fire for his incense! <span
id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459)   She hasted and was a heifer to Boaz,
that should bring forth Thee, the fatted Calf.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p19"></span><span id="page_241">p. 241</span> <span
id="iii.v.viii-Page_241"></span>She went gleaning for her love of Thee;
she gathered straw.  Thou didst quickly pay her the reward of her
lowliness; and instead of ears of corn, the Root of Kings, and instead
of straws, the Sheaf of Life, didst Thou make to spring from her.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p18"></span> The introduction of Ruth after Tamara
was doubtless suggested by [Ruth 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#012),
[Matt. 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#003)<span
id="iii.v.viii-p18.1"></span>, etc.  St. E. seems to mean, “Ruth saw by
faith Christ the High Priest, in whose loins was to be that Fire of
Righteousness which alone could make the incense (i.e. the child which
rose up from Ruth, who is called a coal) to be acceptable.”
