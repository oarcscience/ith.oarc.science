<p class="c16"><a name="iii.vii.vii-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.vii.vii-p1.1"></A>Hymn VI.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.vii.vii-p2"></A>1.&#160; Would that the memory of the fathers would exhale from the tombs; who were very simple as being wise, and reverend as believing.&#160; They without cavilling searched for, and came to the right path.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.vii-p3"></A>He gave the law; the mountains melted away; fools broke through it.&#160; By unclean ravens He fed Elijah at the desert stream; and moreover gave from the skeleton honey unto Samson.&#160; They judged not, nor inquired why it was unclean, why clean.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.vii-p4"></A>2.&#160; And when He made void the sabbaths, the feeble Gentiles were clothed with health.&#160; Samson took the daughter of the aliens, and there was no disputing among the righteous; the prophet also took a harlot, and the just held their peace.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.vii-p5"></A>He blamed the righteous,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_541"></A><A HREF="#fn_541"><FONT SIZE="1">542</FONT></A>
 and He held up and lifted up [to view] their delinquencies:&#160; He pitied sinners,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_542"></A><A HREF="#fn_542"><FONT SIZE="1">543</FONT></A>
 and restored them without cost:&#160; and made low the mountains of their sins:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_543"></A><A HREF="#fn_543"><FONT SIZE="1">544</FONT></A>
&#160; He proved that God is not to be arraigned by men, and as Lord of Truth, that His servants were His shadow; and whatsoever way His will looked, they directed also their own wills; and because Light was in Him,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_544"></A><A HREF="#fn_544"><FONT SIZE="1">545</FONT></A>
 their shadows were enlightened.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.vii-p10"></A>3.&#160; How strangely perplexed are all the heretics by simple things!&#160; For when He plainly foreshadowed this New Testament by that of the Prophets, those pitiable men rose, as though from sleep, and shouted out and made a disturbance.&#160; And the Way, wherein the righteous held straight on, and by their truths had gone forth therein, that [Way] have these broken&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_545"></A><A HREF="#fn_545"><FONT SIZE="1">546</FONT></A>
 up, because they were besotted:&#160; this they left and went out of; because they pried, an evil searching, [yea,] an evil babbling led them astray.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.vii-p12"></A>They saw the ray:&#160; they made it darkness, that they might grope therein:&#160; they saw the jewel, even the faith:&#160; while they pried into it, it fell and was lost.&#160; Of the pearl they made a stone, that they might stumble upon it.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.vii-p13"></A>4.&#160; O Gift, which fools have made a poison!&#160; The People were for separating Thy beauteous root from Thy fountain, though they separated it not:&#160; [false] teachings estranged Thy beauty also from the stock thereof.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.vii-p14"></A>By Thee did they get themselves estranged, who wished to estrange Thee.&#160; By Thee the tribes were cut off and scattered abroad from out of Sion, and also the [false] teachings of the seceders.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.vii-p15"></A>Bring Thyself within the compass of our littleness, O Thou Gift of ours.&#160; For if love cannot find Thee out on all sides, it cannot be still and at rest.&#160; Make Thyself small, Thou Who art too great for all, Who comest unto all!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.vii-p16"></A><A NAME="page_299"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 299</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vii.vii-Page_299"></A>5.&#160; By this would those who wrangle against our Pearl be reproved; because instead of love, strife has come in and dared to essay to unveil thy beauty.&#160; It was not graven, since it is a progeny which cannot be interpreted.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.vii-p17"></A>Thou didst show thy beauty among the abjects to show whereto thou art like, thou Pearl that art all faces.&#160; The beholders were astonied and perplexed at thee.&#160; The separatists separated thee in two, and were separated in two by thee, thou that art of one substance throughout.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.vii-p18"></A>They saw not thy beauty, because there was not in them the eye of truth.&#160; For the veil of prophecy, full as it was of the mysteries; to them was a covering of thy glistering faces:&#160; they thought that thou wast other [than thou art], O thou mirror of ours! and therefore these blind schismatics defiled thy fair beauty.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.vii-p19"></A>6.&#160; Since they have extolled thee too much, or have lowered thee too much, bring them to the even level.&#160; Come down, descend a little from that height of infidelity and heathendom; and come up from the depth of Judaism, though thou art in the Heaven.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.vii-p20"></A>Let our Lord be set between God and men!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_546"></A><A HREF="#fn_546"><FONT SIZE="1">547</FONT></A>
&#160; Let the Prophets be as it were His heralds!&#160; Let the Just One, as being His Father, rejoice! that Word it is which conquered both Jews and Heathens!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.vii-p22"></A>7.&#160; Come, Thou Gift of Holy Church, stay, rest in the midst of Her!&#160; The circumcised have troubled Thee, in that they are vain babblers, and so have the [false] doctrines in that they are contentious.&#160; Blessed be He that gave Thee a goodly company which bears Thee about!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.vii.vii-p23"></A>In the covenant of Moses is Thy brightness shadowed forth:&#160; in the new covenant Thou dartest it forth:&#160; from those first Thy light shineth even unto those last.&#160; Blessed be He that gave us Thy gleam as well as Thy bright rays.</p>
