<span id="iii.vi.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c50"><span
id="iii.vi.xii-p1.1"></span>Hymn XI.</span>

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p2"></span>(<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.vi.xii-p2.1"></span>Resp</span>.—*Let the bodies rejoice which
the Evil One had made naked, that in the water they have put on their
glory!*)

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p3"></span>1.  Give thanks, O daughter, that thy
crownings have been doubled;—for lo! thy temples and thy sons
rejoice.—The dedication of thy temples is in the ministration;—The
dedication of thy sons *is* in the anointing.—Blessed art thou that at
once……—……the tabernacle for them that dwell in thee,—and the Spirit has
abode upon thy sons!

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p4"></span>2.  Our Lord opened up Baptism—in the
midst of Jordan the blessed river.—The height and the depth rejoiced in
Him;—He brings forth the first fruits of His peace from the water,—for
they are first fruits, the fruits of Baptism.—The good *God* in His
compassion will bring to pass—that His peace shall be first fruits on
earth.

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p5"></span>3.  Moses stretched out the temporal
Tabernacle;—the priests bathed themselves in water,—and went in and
ministered; and were stricken and punished,—because their heart within
was not cleansed.—Blessed art thou that in the Passover of the great
Passion,—the priests by the savour of their oblations,—lo! are cleansing
souls in thee!

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p6"></span>4.  Great was the mystery that the
Prophet saw,—the torrent that was mighty.—Into its depths he gazed and
beheld—thy beauty instead of himself; thee it was he saw, for thy faith
passes not away,—thou whose flood unseen shall overwhelm—the subtleties
of idolatry.

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p7"></span>5.  Though John was great among them
that are born of women,—yet he that is little is greater than he,—in
this that his baptized were again baptized,—in the baptism <span
id="page_282">p. 282</span> <span id="iii.vi.xii-Page_282"></span>that
was of the Apostles.—Blessed *art* thou that thy priest is greater than
he—in this alone that forever—abides his baptism.

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p8"></span>6.  The baptism that was of Siloam—did
not bring mercy to the man that was laid *there*—who for thirty and
eight years awaited it,—for he was a respecter of the persons of the
Levites.—Blessed *art* thou that thy healing *is* in thee for all
men,—and thy priests are devoted and ready—for all that *are* in need of
thy help.

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p9"></span>7.  The Prophet healed the waters that
were unwholesome,—and cured the disease of the land that was barren,—so
that its death was done away and its region resounded, for its offspring
increased and its bosom was filled.—Greater is Thy grace, *Lord*, than
Elisha’s!—Multiply my lambs and my flocks—at the great stream of my
fountain! <span id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517)

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p11"></span>8.  Great is the marvel that is within
thy abode;—the flocks together with the Shepherds,—those at the stream
of the waters,—two unseen with one manifest who baptizes.—Blessed *is*
he who is baptized in their fountains!—for three arms have upheld
him,—and three Names have preserved him!
