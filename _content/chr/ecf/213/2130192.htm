<p class="c37"><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p1.1"></A>Hymn XV.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p2"></A>1.&#160; If the head had not been right,&#8212;haply the members had murmured:&#8212;for when because of a perverse head&#8212;the course of the members is put astray,&#8212;they are wont to lay the blame on the head.&#160; <i>R.&#160; Blessed be He who chose thee the pride of our people!</i></p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p3"></A>2.&#160; If now on one that is all goodly,&#8212;on it we lay our hatred;&#8212;how much <i>more</i> if we were hateful!&#8212;Yea even God though He is kind,&#8212;bitter men complain against Him.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p4"></A>3.&#160; Be like the head O ye members!&#8212;Get repose in his purity&#8212;and pleasantness in his tranquillity;&#8212;in his sanctity renown,&#8212;and in his wisdom learning!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p5"></A>4.&#160; Get discernment in his mildness,&#8212;and chastity in his gravity,&#8212;and bounty in his poverty!&#8212;As he is fully and altogether fair,&#8212;let us be altogether fair with him!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p6"></A><A NAME="page_184"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 184</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.xvi-Page_184"></A>5.&#160; See ye how meted and weighed&#8212;are his words and his actions!&#8212;Take heed how even his steps&#8212;keep the measure of peace!&#8212;With all his might he holds the bridle of all himself.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p7"></A>6.&#160; He was master over his youth;&#8212;he bound it in the yoke of chastity:&#8212;his members were not enticed <i>by lust</i>;&#8212;for they were kept under the rod:&#8212;his will he had in subjection.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p8"></A>7.&#160; For he was ready beforehand for his degree,&#8212;as he was ready beforehand in his conversation,&#8212;as he laid his foundations securely.&#8212;He became Head in his youth,&#8212;when they made him preacher to the people.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p9"></A>8.&#160; Excellent was he among preachers,&#8212;learned was he among scholars,&#8212;and understanding was he among the wise:&#8212;chaste was he among his brethren,&#8212;and grave among his familiar friends.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p10"></A>9.&#160; In two abodes was he&#8212;a solitary recluse from <i>his early</i> days;&#8212;for he was holy within his body,&#8212;and solitary within his dwelling;&#8212;openly and secretly was he chaste.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p11"></A>10.&#160; But although we my brethren&#8212;have put astray those measures,&#8212;and we have lost that savour,&#8212;and have become teachers to ourselves,&#8212;unto the perfection that called us.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p12"></A>11.&#160; Yet that measure of Truth&#8212;preserves itself in its vessel:&#8212;<i>Truth</i> chose it because she saw it chose her;&#8212;she has preserved in it her fragrance and savour,&#8212;from the beginning to the end.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p13"></A>12.&#160; The Head both chaste and grave,&#8212;that was not wrathful nor hard,&#8212;nor transgressed even as we <i>did</i>,&#8212;set and kept his own measures,&#8212;and cast a bridle on his thoughts.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p14"></A>13.&#160; He gave example in his person,&#8212;that as he kept the measure of his time,&#8212;so was it meet that we should know our time.&#8212;We have become strangers to our time,&#8212;for we have been witless in the time of discernment.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p15"></A>14.&#160; In the beginning the blast of the wind&#8212;in its might chastens the fruit;&#8212;then in the meantime the might of the sun:&#8212;but when its mightiness is passed,&#8212;its end gathers his sweetness.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p16"></A>15.&#160; But we&#8212;they that were first chastened us;&#8212;and also they that came next rebuked us;&#8212;and they that were last added sweetness to us:&#8212;then when the time of tasting us arrives,&#8212;great was our savourlessness.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p17"></A>16.&#160; For we came to maturity,&#8212;that we might wean the children from wantonness,&#8212;and lead them to gravity:&#8212;<i>but</i> our old age stood in need&#8212;that we should be rebuked as youths.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p18"></A>17.&#160; Accordingly he in kindness endured, nor did he make use of force,&#8212;that he might increase honour to our old age:&#8212;and even if it knew not its degree,&#8212;let him be magnified who knew its time!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p19"></A>18.&#160; And if one say that for the multitude,&#8212;force and the rod should govern it;&#8212;even as for the thief fear,&#8212;and for the spoiler threatening,&#8212;and for fools open shaming.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p20"></A>19.&#160; Yet if with the head as first,&#8212;the members had hasted <i>to move</i> as second,&#8212;they would have drawn that which was third,&#8212;and the whole body from the end&#8212;would have followed after them.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xvi-p21"></A>20.&#160; They that <i>were</i> second despised those that <i>were</i> first,&#8212;and that <i>were</i> third those that <i>were</i> second:&#8212;the degrees were set at naught one by another.&#8212;While these within despised one another,&#8212;they were trodden down likewise by those without.</p>
