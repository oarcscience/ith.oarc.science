<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii.i-p8"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iii.iii.i-p8.1"></A>The</span> two Fathers of the Syrian Church, from whose writings the present Volume presents a selection, are from more than one point of view fitly associated as examples of the leaders of Syriac theological thought and literature.&#160; They are the earliest Syriac authors of whom any considerable remains survive; and they both represent the religious mind of the Syrian Church, but little affected by influences from without, other than the all-pervading influence of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p9"></A>Syriac Literature is, on the whole, of derivative growth.&#160; It consists largely of versions or adaptations from the Greek.&#160; The Syriac language, in the hands of those to whom the Syriac Church owes the admirable version of the Scriptures known as the &#8220;Peshitto,&#8221; proved itself capable of reproducing adequately, not only the sublime conceptions of God and of man&#146;s relations to God which belong to the cognate Hebrew of the Old Testament, but also&#8212;the wider, subtler, and more complex religious ideas for which the writers of the New Testament found their fit vehicle in the Greek.&#160; But the Peshitto, great as its value must have been to the religious life of Syriac-speaking Christians, never became to them what Luther&#146;s Bible has been to Germany, and the &#8220;Authorized&#8221; Bible of King James&#146;s translators to England&#8212;an inspiring force in literature, not merely to elevate and enrich its language, but to quicken it in every branch.&#160; Syriac literature was indeed deeply penetrated by the Syriac Bible, but its level was never raised above mediocrity.&#160; For the most part it is imitative not original;&#8212;nay, it rarely succeeds in assimilating so as to make its own what it has borrowed.&#160; The Syriac translator, if he worked on the writings of a Greek divine, would often paraphrase or even interpolate; if of a Greek historian, would subjoin a continuation; but he would seldom venture farther.&#160; Those who essayed independent authorship were few.&#160; A home-grown Syriac literature began with Ephraim and Aphrahat; but [setting aside a very small number of the writers who followed] it may almost be said to have ended with them.&#160; These two, and these alone, in place of being imitators or translators, were translated and imitated by the writers of foreign nations.&#160; Aphrahat&#146;s literary lot was the singular one, that his work survived in an alien tongue for alien readers, when the original had wellnigh perished out of the mem<A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iii.i-Page_120"></A>ory of his own people.&#160; To Ephraim pertains the high and unique distinction of having originated&#8212;or at least given its living impulse to&#8212;a new departure in sacred literature; and that, not for his own country merely, but for Christendom.&#160; From him came, if not the first idea, at all events the first successful example, of making song an essential constituent of public worship, and an exponent of theological teaching; and from him it spread and prevailed through the Eastern Churches, and affected even those of the West.&#160; To the Hymns, on which chiefly his fame rests, the Syriac ritual in all its forms owes much of its strength and richness; and to them is largely due the place which Hymnody holds throughout the Church everywhere.&#160; And hence it has come to pass that, in the Church everywhere, he stands as the representative Syrian Father, as the fixed epithet appended to his name attests&#8212;&#8220;Ephraim <i>the Syrian</i>,&#8221;&#8212;the one Syrian known and reverenced in all Christendom.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p10"></A>Of the two, it has been usual of late to reckon Aphrahat as the elder.&#160; Further on, it will be shown in this Dissertation that the reasons for so reckoning him are inadequate.&#160; For the present it suffices to note that they were contemporaries&#8212;both living and writing about the middle of the fourth century, and that priority of treatment cannot with confidence be claimed for either.&#160; On grounds of convenience, therefore, we may properly proceed to deal first with Ephraim, as being indisputably far the first in order of importance, of copiousness, and of celebrity.</p>
