<p class="c30"><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p1.1"></A>VII.&#8212;Chronology of the Life of Ephraim.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p2"></A>Thus the fixed points for determining the chronology of Ephraim&#146;s life are:</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p3"></A>1.&#160; The death of his patron, St. Jacob, Bishop of Nisibis, in 338, after the first siege of that city.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p4"></A>2.&#160; The third siege, in which he was among the defenders of the city, in 350.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p5"></A>3.&#160; The surrender of Nisibis by Jovian, and its abandonment by its Christian inhabitants, 363; followed by Ephraim&#146;s removal to Edessa.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p6"></A>4.&#160; The consecration of Basil to the see of C&aelig;sarea, late in 370, followed by Ephraim&#146;s visit to him there.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p7"></A>5.&#160; The deliverance of the Edessenes from the persecution of Valens (370&#8211;372), celebrated by Ephraim in a hymn.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p8"></A>6.&#160; Ephraim&#146;s death, 373.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p9"></A>To this list it would be right to prefix the meeting of the Council of Nic&aelig;a in 325, if the evidence of Ephraim&#146;s presence at it, along with St. Jacob, were sufficient.&#160; But it has no early attestation; and no writer prior to Theodoret (<i>Hist. Eccles</i>. II. 30) associates the name of Jacob with any incident in Ephraim&#146;s life.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p10"></A><A NAME="page_145"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 145</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-Page_145"></A>The date of Ephraim&#146;s birth is nowhere directly stated, but it is usually assumed to have been early in the reign of Constantine (306&#8211;337), on the authority of the Vatican <i>Life</i>, which says, &#8220;In the days of the victorious Constantine, true believer, was born the holy man Ephraim.&#8221;&#160; But the statement of the Parisian <i>Life</i> is less explicit, and is capable of a different meaning:&#8212;&#8220;<i>He was</i> in the days of the victorious Constantine.&#8221;&#160; This merely implies that Ephraim (if the pronoun represent him) lived in the reign of that emperor.&#160; But it rather appears that Ephraim&#146;s father is meant, inasmuch as he is the subject of the immediately preceding sentence which describes him as a heathen priest; and the purport of the passage is, that the saint was the son of a man who not merely had been one of an idolatrous priesthood, but continued to be so after Constantine had acknowledged the Christian religion.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_296"></A><A HREF="#fn_296"><FONT SIZE="1">297</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p12"></A>The earlier authorities give no express statement on this point; but a late tenth-century Greek <i>menologium</i>, that of the Emperor Basil (Porphyrogenitus), says that he &#8220;continued from the reign of Constantine to that of Valens,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_297"></A><A HREF="#fn_297"><FONT SIZE="1">298</FONT></A>
&#8212;implying as it seems that he was born, as the Vatican <i>Life</i> represents, after Constantine&#146;s accession in 306.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p14"></A>Considering, however, that the <i>Life</i> in both its forms affirms that Ephraim was brought by St. Jacob to the Council of Nic&aelig;a in 325&#8212;in which it is borne out by Gregory Barhebr&aelig;us in his <i>Ecclesiastical Chronicle</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_298"></A><A HREF="#fn_298"><FONT SIZE="1">299</FONT></A>
(who though a very late writer (1226&#8211;1286) had access to early authorities and judgment in using them)&#8212;it is hard to reconcile the chronology, for the improbability of the admission of a lad of nineteen, in any capacity, to that venerable assembly, is very great.&#160; If we accept it as a fact that he was chosen by Jacob to accompany him, and was permitted to be present among the Fathers at Nic&aelig;a, it seems almost necessary to place his birth before Constantine became emperor.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_299"></A><A HREF="#fn_299"><FONT SIZE="1">300</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p17"></A>Farther:&#160; the <i>menologium</i> above cited adds that he died &#8220;in extreme old age;&#8221; and the tone and tenor of his <i>testament</i> go far to confirm the truth of these words.&#160; But as he died in 373, he cannot have been more than 67 years old in that year if he was born in 306.&#160; No doubt 67 is a ripe age, but hardly sufficient to warrant the strong expression of the <i>menologium</i>.&#160; Without pressing its language unduly, we may surely take it as implying that he had passed the &#8220;threescore years and ten&#8221; of the Psalmist at the time of his death&#8212;in other words that he was born not later than the first or second year of the fourth century.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p18"></A>Thus by rectifying the text and rendering of the opening sentences of the <i>Life</i>, we relieve ourselves of the supposed necessity of placing his birth in or after 306.&#160; And his presence in the Council of 325, and his extreme old age in 373, concur in pointing to the beginning of the fourth century&#8212;if not to the later years of the third&#8212;as the probable time of that event.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p19"></A>However this may be, whether he was born in 306 or earlier, it is certain that by far the greater part of the long life of the &#8220;Deacon of Edessa&#8221;&#8212;all of it save its last <A NAME="page_146"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 146</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-Page_146"></A>ten or eleven years (363&#8211;373) was passed in his native Nisibis; and that he did not even attain the diaconate till he was considerably over sixty years of age, and within three years of his end.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p11"></A> The passage is as follows:&#160; &#8220;Ephraim was a Syrian by birth.&#160; His father was of Nisibis, and his mother of Amid.&#160; And his father was priest in Nisibis of an idol named Abizal, which afterwards the victorious Emperor Jovian broke.&#160; He [<i>or it, scil.</i>, the idol] was in the days of the victorious Emperor Constantine, true believer.&#160; But his father had this famous son, of whom is our narrative.&#8221;&#160; The meaning may be that the idol was suffered to exist during Constantine&#146;s reign and after, till Jovian destroyed it:&#160; but it is now natural to understand it, as above, of Ephraim&#146;s father.&#160; The Vatican editor seems to have misunderstood his original, which the Parisian transcriber has preserved faithfully,&#8212;and to have altered it into accordance with his misunderstanding, by recasting the passage and substituting &#8220;<i>was born</i>&#8221; for &#8220;<i>was</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.iii.ii.vii-p16"></A> Gregory Barhebr. (<i>Chron. Eccles</i>., II., 10) mentions, but doubtfully, a tradition that Ephraim wrote a letter circ. 334 in which he took the part of Papas, the Catholicus, against &#8220;the Bishops of the East&#8221; who accused him of neglect and misconduct.&#160; If this be accepted, it is additional evidence for the early date of Ephraim&#146;s birth.</p>
