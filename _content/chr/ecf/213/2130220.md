id="iii.iv.xliv-p1.1"></span>Hymn LXIV.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.xliv-p2"></span>1. O feeble ones, why weep ye, over
your dead:  who in death are at rest from sorrows and sins?—2. *R.,
Glory to Him Who endured all, for the sake of all men:  yea tasted death
for the sake of all, to bring all to life*—3. I reveal unto you, that
even Satan, though much content:  at your weeping, yet laughs much, at
your mourning.—4. In mockery he winks at me and nods to me, as a
jester:  “Come let us laugh at sinners, for lo! they are mad.”—5. Truly
they have given up remembrance of that fire, which I have hidden for
them:  and lo! the fools are drunken with weeping, for their
departed.—6. Instead of weeping as though, without provision:  I had
plundered and sent forth their dead, lo! they are mad.—7. The souls of
the evil are to be afflicted, till the judgment day:  and these weep
over the graves, like to madmen.—8. They care not for their own sins,
that haply to-morrow:  they must go in shame of face, to join their
dead.—9. And thus shall all be put to shame alike, family by family:  in
Sheol the wretches shall repent without avail.—10. Leave the drunken and
the madman, until that day:  wherein *each* shall shake off his wine
wherewith he was maddened.—11. I will go to gather them, like children: 
that they may play the wanton and the madman, until they perish.—12. Lo!
I have revealed to you the mystery, the secret of my comrade:  go forth
therefore, depart, amend, in repentance.—13. Leave me, I too will
depart, I will see to my affairs:  that with open face I may give my
account to my Lord.—14. I know that the wind as it blew, has borne away
my words:  for ye are the same whom I, ofttimes have proved.—15. I
remember Jeremiah how he, compared boldness:  to the Indian who changes
not *his skin*, though it is of freedom.—16. For this too belongs to it,
even to freedom:  that it binds itself by the will, as though by
nature.—17. For so powerful is the will, in them that are free:  that it
may be likened to nature, through its workings. <span

free will, it becomes a second nature.
