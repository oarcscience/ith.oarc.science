<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xii-p2"></A>1.&#160; Thy chastening is, <i>as</i> a mother of our infancy:&#8212;her rebuke is merciful, in that Thou hast restrained,&#8212;the children from folly, and they have been made wise!&#160; <i>R., Glory be to thy justice!</i></p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p3"></A>2.&#160; Let us search out Thy justice; for who is sufficient&#8212;to measure its help? since by it the wanton&#8212;are oftentimes made chaste.&#8212;</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p4"></A>3.&#160; Oftentimes Thy hand, O my Lord, has made the sick whole,&#8212;for it is the healer in secret of their diseases,&#8212;and the fount of their life.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p5"></A>4.&#160; Exceeding gently, the finger of Thy justice,&#8212;in love and compassion, touches the wounds&#8212;of him that is to be healed.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p6"></A>5.&#160; Exceeding mild and merciful, is her cutting to him that is wise:&#8212;her sharp remedy, in its mighty love,&#8212;consumes the corrupt <i>part</i>.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p7"></A>6.&#160; Exceeding welcome her wrath, to him that is discerning;&#8212;but her remedies are hated, of the fool who has delight&#8212;in the trouble of his limbs.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p8"></A>7.&#160; Exceeding eager is she, to bind the cut she has made;&#8212;when she has smitten she pities, that from between these two&#8212;she may breed healing.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p9"></A>8. Exceeding welcome her wrath, and her anger pleasant,&#8212;and sweet her bitterness, sweetening bitter things&#8212;that they may be made pleasant.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p10"></A>9.&#160; A cause of negligence is Thy indulgence to the careless;&#8212;a cause of profit, is Thy rod among the slothful&#8212;so that they become <i>as</i> traffickers.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p11"></A>10.&#160; The cause of our affliction, it is Thy justice;&#8212;the cause of our carelessness, it is Thy graciousness,&#8212;for our understanding has turned foolish.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p12"></A>11.&#160; Pharaoh hardened himself, because of Thy graciousness;&#8212;for when the plagues were stayed, his cruelties waxed strong,&#8212;and he lied to his promises.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p13"></A>12.&#160; Justice requited him, because he lied greatly against her,&#8212;even <i>Grace</i> her freeborn sister; yea she restrained him again&#8212;that he should not again provoke.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p14"></A>13.&#160; Rebuke, O my Lord, my guide, for it has been false as Egypt &#8212;my prayers testify, that I am not as she,&#8212;for Thy door have I not forsaken.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p15"></A>14.&#160; Let Thy cross, O my Lord, which stands, in my breaches that are open,&#8212;repair again the <i>breaches</i> that are hidden; for instead of those without,&#8212;those within have cleft me asunder!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p16"></A>15.&#160; A sea has broken through, and cast down, the watch tower wherein I had triumphed.&#8212;Iniquity has dared to set up, a temple wherein I am shamed:&#160; its drink-offering chokes me.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p17"></A>16.&#160; My prayers on my walls, my persecutors have heard:&#8212;the sun and his worshippers, are ashamed of their magicians,&#8212;for I have triumphed by Thy cross.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p18"></A>17.&#160; <i>All</i> creatures cried out, when they saw the struggle,&#8212;while Truth with falsehood, on my battered walls, fought and was crowned conqueror.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p19"></A>18.&#160; The force of Truth, chastised falsehood:&#8212;in its chastisement it felt <i>Truth</i>, and through its <i>own</i> sins, it earned her victory.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p20"></A>19.&#160; I have great alarm; for since my deliverance,&#8212;the honourable and mighty, who were devoted to my altar, have built in me high places.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p21"></A>20.&#160; My seven senses, O my Lord, even though they had been as fountains of tears, yet my tears were <i>too</i> little&#8212;to lament our ruin.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p22"></A>21.&#160; The streets that <i>were</i> in sackcloth, and ashes cried out,&#8212;disturbed by the play, akin to that which <i>was</i>,&#8212;in the wilderness before the calf.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.xii-p23"></A>22.&#160; Poison seeks and wears, the beauty of lilies;&#8212;and though their buds may conceal, and hidden disguise it,&#8212;it blossoms in their bitter flowers.</p>
