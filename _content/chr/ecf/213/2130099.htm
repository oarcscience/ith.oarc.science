<p class="c23"><a name="ii.vii.xvii-p4"></A>Gregory to Isacius, &amp;c.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vii.xvii-p5"></A>In keeping with the truth of history, what means the fact that at the time of the flood the human race outside the ark dies, but within the ark is preserved unto life, but what we see plainly now, namely that all the unfaithful perish under the wave of their sin, while the unity of holy Church, like the compactness of the ark, keeps her faithful ones in faith and in charity?&#160; And this ark in truth is compacted of incorruptible timber, since it is built of strong souls, and such as persevere in good.&#160; And, when any single person is converted from a secular life, timber is, as it were, still cut down from the mountains.&#160; But when, according to the order of holy Church, one is assigned to have custody of others, it is as though the ark were built of timber sawn and put together for preserving the life of men.&#160; And in truth that ark, when the flood was over, rested on a mountain, because when the corruption of this life is over, when the billows of evil works have passed away, holy Church will rest in the heavenly country, as on a high mountain.&#160; To the building, therefore, of this ark we rejoice to find, after reading your Fraternity&#146;s epistle, that in the compactness of a right faith you lend your aid; and we render great thanks to Almighty God, who, though the pastors of His flock are changed, keeps the faith which He once delivered to the holy Fathers, even after them unchangeable.&#160; Now the excellent preacher says, <i>Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Christ Jesus</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011">1 Cor. iii. 11</a><a name="ii.vii.xvii-p5.1"></A>).&#160; Whosoever, then, with love of God and his neighbour, holds firmly the faith which is in Christ, he has laid the same Jesus Christ, Son of God and man, as a foundation for himself from the Father.&#160; It is to be hoped, then, that, where Christ is the foundation, the building also of good works may follow.&#160; The Truth itself also in person says, <i>He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.&#160; But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#001">Joh. x. 1</a><a name="ii.vii.xvii-p5.2"></A>).&#160; And a little afterwards He adds, I am the door.&#160; He, then, enters into the sheepfold by the door who enters by Christ.&#160; And he enters by Christ who thinks and preaches what is true concerning the same Creator and Redeemer of the human race, keeps what he preaches, and undertakes the topmost place of government with a view to a burdensome office, not in desire of the glory of transitory dignity.&#160; He watches also wisely over the charge of the sheepfold which he has taken in hand, lest either perverse men speaking forwardly tear <A NAME="page_68"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 68</FONT></A> <a name="ii.vii.xvii-Page_68"></A>the sheep of God, or malignant spirits waste them by persuading them to vicious delights.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vii.xvii-p6"></A>But in all these things may He instruct us Who for our sake was made man.&#160; May He Who vouchsafed to become what He made Himself infuse the spirit of His love both into my infirmity and thy charity, and open the eye of our heart in all carefulness and watchful circumspection.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vii.xvii-p7"></A>But that men of a right faith are advanced to sacred orders, thanks should be given without cease to the same Almighty God, and prayer should ever be made for the life of our most pious and Christian lord the Emperor, and for his most tranquil spouse, and his most gentle offspring, in whose times the mouths of heretics are silent, since, though their hearts seethe in the madness of perverse opinion, yet in the time of the orthodox Emperor they presume not to speak out the wrong opinions which they hold; so that we plainly see fulfilled what is written, <i>Gathering the waters of the sea together as in a bottle</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#007">Psa. 33.7</a><a name="ii.vii.xvii-p7.1"></A>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">160</FONT></A>
).&#160; For the water of the sea is gathered together as in a bottle, because whatever wrong opinions the bitter science of heretics entertains at the present day it keeps within the breast, and presumes not to express them openly.&#160; But thy Fraternity, spiritually taught, has set forth in all respects the right faith, and has thoroughly declared the things that should be sought after.&#160; Your faith, therefore, is ours.&#160; We hold what you say, and say what you hold.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vii.xvii-p9"></A>But, inasmuch as it has come to our ears that in the Churches of the East no one attains to sacred orders but by giving of bribes, if your Fraternity finds that this is the case, you should offer as your first oblation to Almighty God the restraining of the error of simoniacal heresy in the Churches subject to you.&#160; For, not to speak of other things, what sort of men can they be when in sacred orders who are advanced to them not by merit but by bribes?&#160; Now we know with what animadversion the Prince of the apostles attacked this heresy, having pronounced the first sentence of condemnation against Simon, when he said, <i>Thy money be with thee unto perdition, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#020">Acts viii. 20</a><a name="ii.vii.xvii-p9.1"></A>).&#160; Our Lord God Himself also, the Creator and Redeemer of the human race, having made a scourge of small cords, overthrew and cast out of the temple the seats of them that sold doves (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#000">Matth. xxi</a><a name="ii.vii.xvii-p9.2"></A>.).&#160; For to sell doves in the temple, what else is it but to give for a price in holy Church that imposition of hands whereby the Holy Spirit is given?&#160; But the seats of them that sold doves were overthrown, because the priesthood of such is not accounted as priesthood.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.vii.xvii-p10"></A>Moreover, I have been informed that in the Church which is called Neas, strifes often arise with your Church in the city of Jerusalem.&#160; Wherefore your Holiness ought carefully to consider all things, and to correct some things gently, but bear others that cannot be corrected with equanimity.&#160; For we see plainly what is said by holy Church through the voice of the Psalmist, <i>Sinners have built upon my back</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#003">Psa. 130.3</a><a name="ii.vii.xvii-p10.1"></A>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">161</FONT></A>
.&#160; For on the back burdens are borne.&#160; Sinners, then, build upon our back, when we bear with sufferance those whom we cannot correct.&#160; For the steersman of a ship, when he considers that the wind is against him, surmounts some billows by steering right over them, but some which he foresees cannot be surmounted he prudently avoids by turning his course aside.&#160; So, therefore, let your Holiness mitigate some evils by repressing them, and others by bearing them, so as in all respects to conserve the peace of them that dwell together in the holy Church of Jerusalem.&#160; For it is written, <i>Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see God</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014">Hebr. xii. 14</a><a name="ii.vii.xvii-p11.1"></A>).&#160; For in quarrels the very light of the soul, the light of good intent, is blocked.&#160; Whence the Psalmist says, <i>Mine eye is troubled because of anger</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#008">Ps. vi. 8</a><a name="ii.vii.xvii-p11.2"></A>).&#160; And what remains in us of well-doing, if we lose peace from the heart, without which we cannot see the Lord?&#160; Do you therefore so act as to gather the gain of your reward even from those who through strife might have caused it to perish.&#160; May Almighty God guard your Love with heavenly grace, and grant you to carry with you from those who are committed to you manifold fruit and measure running over to eternal joys.</p>
