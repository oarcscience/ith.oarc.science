<p class="c37"><a name="iii.iv.vii-p1"></A> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.iv.vii-p1.1"></A>Hymn VI.</span></p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.vii-p2"></A>1.&#160; I will run in my affections, to Him who heals freely.&#160; He who healed my sorrows, the first and the second, <i>He</i> who cured the third, He will heal the fourth.&#160; <i>R., Heal me, Thou Son the First Born!</i></p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p3"></A>2.&#160; My sons, O my Lord, drank and were drunken, of the tidings which wrath had mixed; and they rushed on my adornments, and spoiled and cast away my ornaments; they rent and spared not, my garments and my crowns.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p4"></A>3.&#160; They uncovered me and I was made bare.&#160; Because I was shamed a little, by means of that stripping, the first and the second, because I was shamed a third time, lo! they have stripped me a fourth time.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p5"></A>4.&#160; For they have seized and taken away my garments, my ornaments and my gardens.&#160; On the sackcloth that girds my altar, look Thou, O my Lord, and have pity on me!&#160; Let the sackcloth be to me, O my Lord, the breastplate of salvation!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p6"></A>5.&#160; Lo! it is not by the hand of the chaste, that Thou hast chastised me, O my Master!&#160; For lo! his shame is before him, and behind him his disgrace; for as to his marriage, adultery is better than it.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p7"></A>6.&#160; Lo! his daughter is his wife, and his sister his consort; and his mother whence he came forth, he turns again and takes her <i>to wife</i>!&#160; The heavens are astonished that thus, he provokes <i>Thee</i>, and lo! he prospers.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p8"></A>7.&#160; And though, O my Lord, my crimes are many, are my offences so heavy, that Thou shouldst make over a chaste woman, mother of chaste <i>daughters</i>, to foul Assyria, mother of defiled <i>daughters</i>?</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p9"></A>8.&#160; Restrain him that he come not, and wag at me his head, and stamp on me his heel, and rejoice that the voice of his fame, thus troubles the world; and be uplifted yet a little!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p10"></A>9.&#160; My sons, O my Lord, have seen my nakedness, yea have uncovered me and wept.&#160; Uncover Thou me before my children, who are pained by my pain, and let <A NAME="page_175"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 175</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.vii-Page_175"></A>not those mock at me, the accursed that <i>have</i> no pity!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p11"></A>10.&#160; My lands had brought forth fruits and pleasant things; good things in the vineyard, abundance in the fields.&#160; But as I rested secure, of a sudden wrath overtook me.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p12"></A>11.&#160; The husbandmen <i>were</i> plundered, the spoilers heaped <i>the grain</i>; what thou had borrowed and sown these destroyed.&#160; With one&#146;s debt his hunger, haply will also remain unsatisfied, for his bread <i>is</i> snatched from him.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p13"></A>12.&#160; The husbandman, O my Lord, <i>is</i> plundered, for he lent to the earth; she has received the deposit, and given it to a stranger; she has borrowed it of the husbandman; and paid it to the spoiler.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p14"></A>13.&#160; Be jealous over me who am Thine, and to Thee, O my Lord:&#160; am I betrothed!&#160; The Apostle who betrothed me to Thee, told me that Thou art jealous.&#160; For as a wall to chaste <i>wives</i> is the jealousy of their husbands.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p15"></A>14.&#160; Samson stirred up seas, because he was mightily jealous over his wife, though she was greatly defiled, and was divided against him.&#160; Keep Thy Church, for no other, has she beside Thee!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p16"></A>15.&#160; Whoso is not jealous, over his spouse despises her.&#160; Jealousy it is that can make known, the love that is within.&#160; Thou art called jealous, that thou mayest show me Thy love.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p17"></A>16.&#160; The nature of woman is this; it is weak and rash: it is jealousy keeps it, under fear every hour.&#160; Thou hast been named among the jealous, that Thou mightest make known Thy solicitude.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p18"></A>17.&#160; Every man has been master, of something that <i>was</i> not his own; every man has gone forth gathering, something that he scattered not.&#160; The day of confusion, I have prepared for myself by my crimes.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p19"></A>18.&#160; How shall they bear the suffering, the labourers and tillers?&#160; In the face of the vinedresser, they have cut down the vines and driven away the flocks of the husbandman; his sowing they have reaped and carried off.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p20"></A>19.&#160; They had yoked cattle sown and harrowed, they had ploughed, planted, nurtured.&#160; They stood afar and wept; and they went away bereft of all.&#160; The labour <i>was</i> for the toilers, the increase for the spoilers.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p21"></A>20.&#160; The rulers, O my Lord, maintained not, order in the midst of <i>Thy</i> wrath.&#160; If they had willed <i>it</i> they might have kept order, but our iniquity suffered it not.&#160; Though wrath had greatly abated, wrath compelled <i>them</i> to spoil.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p22"></A>21.&#160; To whom on any side, shall I look for comfort, for my plantations that are laid low, and my possessions that are laid waste?&#160; Let the message of the voice of peace, drive away my sadness from me!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p23"></A>22.&#160; Give me not over; lest it be thought that Thou, hast given me a writing of divorce, and sent me away and driven me out!&#160; Let them not call me, O my Lord, the forsaken and the disgraced!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p24"></A>23.&#160; I have not anything, to call to mind before Thine eyes, for I am wholly despised.&#160; Call Thou to mind for me, O my God, this only that none other, have I set before me beside Thee!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p25"></A>24.&#160; Who would not weep for me, with voice and wailing? for before the days of full <i>moon</i> I was chaste and crowned; and after the days of full moon, I was uncovered and made bare.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p26"></A>25.&#160; My chaste daughters of the chambers, wander in the fields; for the wrath that makes all drunken, has caused my honourable women to be despised.&#160; Let Thy mercy which gives peace to all, restore these beloved ones to honour!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p27"></A>26.&#160; My elder <i>daughters</i> and my younger, lo! they cry before Thee; the damsels with their voices, they that are aged with their tears; my virgins with their fasts, my chaste ones with their sackcloth!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p28"></A>27.&#160; Mine eyes to all the streets, I lift up and lo! they are deserted.&#160; There are left of a hundred ten, and a thousand of ten thousand.&#160; Give Thou peace and fill my streets, with the tumult of my dwellers!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p29"></A><A NAME="page_176"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 176</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.vii-Page_176"></A>28.&#160; Bring back them that are without, and make them glad that are within!&#160; Mighty is Thy grace, that Thou extendest it within and without.&#160; Let the wings of Thy grace gather my chickens together!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p30"></A>29.&#160; Let the prayer of my just men, save my fugitives!&#160; The unbelievers have plundered me, and the believers have sustained me.&#160; In them that believe put Thou to shame them that believe not!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p31"></A>30.&#160; There came together on one day, two festivals as one:&#160; the Feast of Thine Ascension, and the Feast of Thy Champions; the feast that wove Thy Crown, and the memorial of the crowning of Thy servants.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p32"></A>31.&#160; Have thou mercy because there were doubled for us, <i>these</i> feasts on one day; and there were doubled for us instead of them, <i>even</i> the two feasts in one, suffering from the voice of <i>ill</i> tidings, and mourning from desolation!</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p33"></A>32.&#160; Give peace to my festivals! for both my feasts have ceased; and instead of rejoicing, <i>of</i> my remnants in festivals, tremblings and desolations meet me in every place.</p> 
<p><a name="iii.iv.vii-p34"></A>33.&#160; Bring home mine that are far off, make glad mine that are nigh; and in the midst of our land shall be preached, good tidings of joy; and I shall render in return for peace, praise from every mouth!</p>
