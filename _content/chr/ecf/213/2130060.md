id="ii.v.liv-p1.1"></span>Epistle CXVII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.liv-p2"></span>To Brunichild, Queen of the Franks.

<span id="ii.v.liv-p3"></span>Gregory to Brunichild, &c.

<span id="ii.v.liv-p4"></span>Whereas for the government of a kingdom
valour stands in need of justice, and power of equity, nor for this
purpose can one suffice without the other, with what great love your
care for these things is resplendent is shewn plainly enough by the fact
of your governing crowds of nations so laudably.  Who then, considering
this, can distrust the goodness of your Excellency, or be doubtful of
obtaining his request, when he thinks it right to ask for what he knows
you would willingly bestow upon your subjects?  The bearer, then, of
these presents, Hilarius <span id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76) , a
servant of your Excellency, supposing that our intervention with your
power will aid him, has requested to be supported by letters of
commendation from us; holding it as certain that he will more abundantly
obtain such favours as you grant to others if our intercession should
speak for him.  Accordingly, paying you our address of greeting with the
affection of paternal charity, we beg that, as he states that he is
labouring under adversities from the iniquity of certain persons, the
protection of your Excellence may defend him; and, lest he should
possibly be oppressed against reason, that by your command you would
order him to be kept safe; that so, while no one’s opposition shall have
place unjustly and of mere will, both we may return thanks for having
obtained what rather for your own reward we request, and that the
blessed Peter, Prince of the Apostles, whom you will venerate in us with
Christian devotion by granting what we ask, may recompense your
Excellency.
