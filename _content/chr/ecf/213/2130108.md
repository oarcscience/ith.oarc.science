<span id="ii.vii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ii.vii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle LX.</span>

<span id="ii.vii.xxvi-p2"></span>*To Theodebert, King of the
Franks* <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170) .

<span id="ii.vii.xxvi-p4"></span>Gregory to Theodebert, &c.

<span id="ii.vii.xxvi-p5"></span>One who receives with willing mind and
embraces in the bosom of his heart words of fatherly admonition declares
himself without doubt to be one who would be an amender of faults.  On
which account the absolute promise of your Excellence assures us
sufficiently.  For we hold in place of a pledge the words of one who is
good for payment.  Therefore let your Excellency vouchsafe, adhering to
the commands of our God, to give zealous attention to the assembling of
a synod, that every corporal vice in priests, and simoniacal heresy,
which was the first to arise in Churches from iniquitous ambition, may
under threat of the censure of your power be removed by the definition
of a council, and be cut off by the roots; lest, if gold is loved in
your parts more than God, He who now remains tranquil while His precepts
are despised be felt hereafter to be wrathful in vengeance.  And indeed,
because we say all this for your own behoof, we therefore cease not to
press you again and again, that we may be able, even by importunity, to
do good to our most excellent and most sweet sons.  For it will be in
all respects of advantage to your kingdom, if what is done in those
parts against God be corrected by the emendation of your Excellency.

<span id="ii.vii.xxvi-p6"></span>Furthermore, what good service your
Excellency did to our most reverend brother and fellow-bishop Augustine
on his progress to the nation of the Angli we have learnt from the
report of certain monks who returned to us from him.  Rendering you the
greatest thanks for this, we beg you to bestow your benefits abundantly
on the monks, the bearers of these <span id="page_73">p. 73</span> <span
id="ii.vii.xxvi-Page_73"></span>presents, whom we have sent to our said
brother, to the end that, while under your patronage, they find no
difficulties in your parts, but accomplish easily with the help of
Christ the journey they have undertaken, you may reap your richer fruit
of reward before the eyes of our God.
