#### <span id="viii.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>section 2.—publication of the discovered works: the effect.

<span id="viii.ii.ii-p1"></span>In 1875 <span
id="viii.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>Bryennios, who had been chosen Metropolitan
of Serræ during his absence at the Old Catholic conference in Bonn,
published at Constantinople the two Epistles of <span
id="viii.ii.ii-p1.2"></span>Clement, with prolegomena and notes; giving
the text found in the Jerusalem Codex, as he termed it. All patristic
scholars welcomed his work, which bore every mark of care and learning;
showing the results of his contact, as a student, with German methods.
Bishop <span id="viii.ii.ii-p1.3"></span>Lightfoot and many others at
once made use of this new material. The remaining contents of the Codex
were named in the volume of <span id="viii.ii.ii-p1.4"></span>Bryennios,
and some interest awakened by the mention of the <span
id="viii.ii.ii-p1.5"></span>Teaching. The learned Metropolitan furnished
new readings from other parts of the Codex to German scholars. At the
close of 1883 he published in Constantinople the text of the <span
id="viii.ii.ii-p1.6"></span>Teaching, with prolegomena and notes. A copy
of the volume was received in Germany in January, 1884; was translated
into German, and published Feb. 3, 1884; translated from German into
English, and published in <span id="page_373">p. 373</span> <span
id="viii.ii.ii-Page_373"></span>America, Feb. 28, 1884; Archdeacon <span
id="viii.ii.ii-p1.7"></span>Farrar published (<span
id="viii.ii.ii-p1.8"></span>Contemporary Review) a version from the
Greek in May, 1884. Before the close of the year the literature on the
subject, exclusive of newspaper articles, covered fifty titles (given by
<span id="viii.ii.ii-p1.9"></span>Schaff) in Western Europe and
America. <span id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359)
