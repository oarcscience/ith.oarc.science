<span id="iii.ii.iv.xvi"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XVI.—Of the Passion of Jesus Christ; That It Was Foretold.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xvi-p1"></span>I come now to the passion itself,
which is often cast in our teeth as a reproach: <span
id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683) that we worship a man, and one who was
visited and tormented with remarkable punishment: that I may show that
this very passion was undergone by Him in accordance with a great and
divine plan, and that goodness and truth and wisdom are contained in it
alone. For if He had been most happy on the earth, and had reigned
through all His life in the greatest prosperity, no wise man would
either have believed Him to be a God, or judged Him worthy of divine
honour: which is the case with those who are destitute of true divinity,
who not only look up <span id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684) to
perishable riches, and frail power, and the advantages arising from the
benefit of another, but even consecrate them, and knowingly do service
to the memory of the dead, worshipping fortune when it is now
extinguished, which the wise never regarded as an object of worship even
when alive and present with them. For nothing among earthly things can
be venerable and worthy of heaven; but it is virtue alone, and justice
<span id="page_117">p. 117</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xvi-Page_117"></span>alone, which can be judged a true,
and heavenly, and perpetual good, because it is neither given to any
one, nor taken away. And since Christ came upon earth, supplied with
virtue and righteousness, yea rather, since He Himself is virtue, and
Himself righteousness, He descended that He might teach it and mould the
character of man. And having performed this office and embassy from God,
on account of this very virtue which He at once taught and practised, He
deserved, and was able, to be believed a God by all nations. Therefore,
when a great multitude from time to time flocked to Him, either on
account of the righteousness which He taught or on account of the
miracles which He worked, and heard His precepts, and believed that He
was sent by God, and that He was the Son of God, then the rulers and
priests of the Jews, excited with anger because they were rebuked by Him
as sinners, and perverted by envy, because, while the multitude flocked
to Him, they saw themselves despised and deserted, and (that which was
the crowning point of their guilt) blinded by folly and error, and
unmindful of the instructors sent from heaven, and of the prophets, they
caballed against Him, and conceived the impious design of putting Him to
death, and torturing Him: of which the prophets had long before written.
 

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xvi-p4"></span>For both <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xvi-p4.1"></span>David, in the beginning of his Psalms,
foreseeing in spirit what a crime they were about to commit, says, <span
id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685) “Blessed is the man who hath not
walked in the way of the ungodly; “and <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xvi-p5.2"></span>Solomon in the book of Wisdom used these
words: <span id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686) “Let us defraud the
righteous, for he is unpleasant to us, and upbraideth us with our
offences against the law. He maketh his boast that he has the knowledge
of God; and he calleth himself the Son of God. He is made to
reprove <span id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687) our thoughts: it
grieveth us even to look upon him: for his life is not like the life of
others; his ways are of another fashion. <span
id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688) We are counted by him as
triflers, <span id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689) he withdraweth himself
from our ways as from filthiness; he commendeth greatly <span
id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690) the latter end of the just, and
boasteth that he has God for his Father. Let us see, therefore, if his
words be true; let us prove what end <span
id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691) he shall have; let us examine him with
rebukes and torments that we may know his meekness, <span
id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692) and prove his patience; let us condemn
him to a shameful death. Such things have they imagined, and have gone
astray. For their own folly hath blinded them, and they do not
understand the mysteries <span id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693) of
God.” Does he not describe that impious design entered into by the
wicked against God, so that he clearly appears to have been present? But
from <span id="iii.ii.iv.xvi-p13.2"></span>Solomon, who foretold these
things, to the time of their accomplishment, ten hundred and ten years
intervened. We feign nothing; we add nothing. They who performed the
actions had these accounts; they, against whom these things were spoken,
read them. But even now the inheritors of their name and guilt have
these accounts, and in their daily readings re-echo their own
condemnation as foretold by the voice of the prophets; nor do they ever
admit them into their heart, which is also itself a part of their
condemnation. The Jews, therefore, being often reproved by Christ, who
upbraided them with their sins and iniquities, and being almost deserted
by the people, were stirred up to put Him to death.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xvi-p14"></span>Now His humility emboldened them to
this deed. For when they read with what great power and glory the Son of
God was about to descend from heaven, but on the other hand saw <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xvi-p14.1"></span>Jesus humble, peaceful, of low
condition, <span id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694) without comeliness,
they did not believe that He was the Son of God, being ignorant that two
advents on His part were foretold by the prophets: the first, obscure in
humility of the flesh; the other, manifest in the power of His majesty.
Of the first <span id="iii.ii.iv.xvi-p15.2"></span>David thus speaks in
the seventy-first Psalm: <span id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695) “He
shall descend as rain upon a fleece; and in His days shall righteousness
spring forth, and abundance of peace, as long as the moon is lifted up.”
For as rain, if it descends upon a fleece, cannot be perceived, because
it makes no sound; so he said that Christ would come to the earth
without exciting the notice <span id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696) of
any, that He might teach righteousness and peace. Isaiah also thus
spoke: <span id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697) “Lord, who hath believed
our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We made
proclamation <span id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698) before Him as
children, and as a root in a thirsty land: He has no form nor glory; and
we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness. But His form was without
honour, and defective beyond the rest of men. He is a man
acquainted <span id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699) with grief, and
knowing how to endure infirmity, because He turned <span
id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700) His face away from us; and He was not
esteemed. He <span id="page_118">p. 118</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xvi-Page_118"></span>carries our sins, and He endures pain
for us: and we thought that He Himself <span
id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701) was in pain, and grief, and vexation.
But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised <span
id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702) for our offences; the
chastisement <span id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703) of our peace was
upon Him, by His bruises <span id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704) we are
healed. All we like sheep have gone astray, and God hath delivered Him
up for our sins.” And in the same manner the <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xvi-p25.3"></span>Sibyl spoke: “Though an object of pity,
dishonoured, without form, He will give hope to those who are objects of
pity.” On account of this humility they did not recognise their God, and
entered into the detestable design of depriving Him of life, who had
come to give them life.
