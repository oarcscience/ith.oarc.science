#### <span id="iii.ii.iii.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXVI.—It is Divine Instruction Only Which Bestows Wisdom; And of What Efficacy the Law of God is.

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxvi-p1"></span>That, therefore, which they
perceived to be justly required by the demands of nature, but which they
were themselves unable to perform, and saw that the philosophers could
not effect, is accomplished only by divine instruction; for that only is
wisdom. Doubtless they were able to persuade any one who do not even
persuade themselves of anything; or they will crush the desires,
moderate the anger, and restrain the lusts of any one, when they
themselves both yield to vices, and acknowledge that they are
overpowered by nature. But what influence is exerted on the souls of men
by the precepts of God, because of their simplicity and truth, is shown
by daily proofs. Give me a man who is passionate, scurrilous, and
unrestrained; with a very few words of God,  

> <span id="iii.ii.iii.xxvi-p1.1"></span> “I will render him as gentle
> as a sheep.” <span id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475)  

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxvi-p3"></span>Give me one who is grasping,
covetous, and tenacious; I will presently restore him to you liberal,
and freely bestowing his money with full hands. Give me a man who is
afraid of pain and death; he shall presently despise crosses, and fires,
and the bull of <span id="iii.ii.iii.xxvi-p3.1"></span>Phalaris. <span
id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476) Give me one who is lustful, an
adulterer, a glutton; you shall presently see him sober, chaste, and
temperate. Give me one who is cruel and bloodthirsty: that fury shall
presently be changed into true clemency. Give me a man who is unjust,
foolish, an evil-doer; forthwith he shall be just, and wise, and
innocent: for by one laver <span id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477) all
his wickedness shall be taken away. So great is the power of divine
wisdom, that, when infused into the breast of man, by one impulse it
once for all expels folly, which is the mother of faults, for the
effecting of which there is no need of payment, or books, or nightly
studies. These results are accomplished gratuitously, easily, and
quickly, if only the ears are open and the breast thirsts for wisdom.
Let no one fear: we do not sell water, nor offer the sun for a reward.
The fountain of God, most abundant and most full, is open to all; and
this heavenly light rises for all, <span
id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478) as many as have eyes. Did any of the
philosophers effect these things, or is he able to effect them if he
wishes? For though they spend their lives in the study of philosophy,
they are neither able to improve any other person nor themselves (if
nature has presented any obstacle). Therefore their wisdom, doing its
utmost, does not eradicate, but hide vices. But a few precepts of God so
entirely change the whole man, and having put off the old man, render
him new, that you would not recognise him as the same.
