<span id="iii.ii.iv.xx"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xx-p0.1"></span>Chap. XX.—Of the Departure of Jesus into Galilee After His Resurrection; And of the Two Testaments, the Old and the New.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xx-p1"></span>Therefore He went into Galilee, for He
was unwilling to show Himself to the Jews, lest He should lead them to
repentance, and restore them from their impiety to a sound mind. <span
id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785) And <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xx-p2.2"></span>there He opened to His disciples again
assembled the writings of Holy Scripture, that is, the secrets of the
prophets; which before His suffering could by no means be understood,
for they told of Him and of His passion. Therefore <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xx-p2.3"></span>Moses, and the prophets also themselves,
call the law which was given to the Jews a testament: for unless the
testator shall have died, a testament cannot be confirmed; nor can that
which is written in it be known, because it is closed and sealed. And
thus, unless Christ had undergone death, the testament could not have
been opened; that is, the mystery of God could not have been
unveiled <span id="fr_786"></span>[787](#fn_786) and understood.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xx-p4"></span>But all Scripture is divided into two
Testaments. That which preceded the advent and passion of Christ—that
is, the law and the prophets—is called the Old; but those things which
were written after His resurrection are named the New Testament. The
Jews make use of the Old, we of the New: but yet they are not
discordant, for the New is the fulfilling of the Old, and in both there
is the same testator, even Christ, who, having suffered death for us,
<span id="page_123">p. 123</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xx-Page_123"></span>made us heirs of His everlasting
kingdom, the people of the Jews being deprived and disinherited. <span
id="fr_787"></span>[788](#fn_787) As the prophet <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xx-p5.4"></span>Jeremiah testifies when he speaks such
things: <span id="fr_788"></span>[789](#fn_788) “Behold, the days come,
saith the Lord, that I will make a new testament <span
id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789) to the house of Israel and the house
of Judah, not according to the testament which I made to their fathers,
in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of
Egypt; for they continued not in my testament, and I disregarded <span
id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790) them, saith the Lord.” Also in another
place he says in like manner: <span id="fr_791"></span>[792](#fn_791) “I
have forsaken my house, I have given up mine heritage into the hand of
its enemies. Mine heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest; it
hath cried out against me, therefore have I hated it.” Since the
inheritance is His heavenly kingdom, it is evident that He does not say
that He hates the inheritance itself, but the heirs, who have been
ungrateful towards Him, and impious. Mine heritage, he says, is become
unto me as a lion; that is, I am become a prey and a devouring to my
heirs, who have slain me as the flock. It hath cried out against me;
that is, they have pronounced against me the sentence of death and the
cross. For that which He said above, that He would make <span
id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792) a new testament to the house of Judah,
shows that the old testament which was given by <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xx-p10.2"></span>Moses was not perfect; <span
id="fr_793"></span>[794](#fn_793) but that that which was to be given by
Christ would be complete. But it is plain that the house of Judah does
not signify the Jews, whom He casts off, but us, who have been called by
Him out of the Gentiles, and have by adoption succeeded to their place,
and are called sons <span id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794) of the Jews,
which the <span id="iii.ii.iv.xx-p12.1"></span>Sibyl declares when she
says:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.iv.xx-p12.2"></span> “The divine race of the blessed,
> heavenly Jews.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xx-p13"></span>But what that race was about to be,
Isaiah teaches, in whose book the Most High Father addresses His
Son: <span id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795) “I the Lord God have called
Thee in righteousness, and will hold Thine hand, and will keep
Thee: <span id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796) and I have given Thee for
a covenant of my race, <span id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797) for a
light of the Gentiles; to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out the
prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the
prison-house.” When, therefore, we who were in time past as it were
blind, and as it were shut up in the prison of folly, were sitting in
darkness, ignorant of God and of the truth, we have been enlightened by
Him, who adopted us by His testament; and having freed us from cruel
chains, and brought us out to the light of wisdom, He admitted us to the
inheritance of His heavenly kingdom.

rendered “covenant” is the same (<span

places “testament,” which does not supply the sense here required. The
attempt to give the meaning “testament” in all places causes much
confusion, as in this passage.
