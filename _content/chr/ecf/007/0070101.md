#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Chap. XIX.—Of the Death, Burial, and Resurrection of Jesus; And the Predictions of These Events.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xix-p2"></span>What more can now be said respecting
the crime of the Jews, than that they were then blinded and seized with
incurable madness, who read these things daily, and yet neither
understood them, nor were able to be on their guard so as not to do
them? Therefore, being lifted up and nailed to the cross, He cried to
the Lord with a loud voice, and of His own accord gave up His spirit.
And at the same hour there was an earthquake; and the veil of the
temple, which separated the two tabernacles, was rent into two parts;
and the sun suddenly withdrew its light, and there was darkness from the
sixth <span id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775) even to the ninth hour. Of
which event the prophet <span id="iii.ii.iv.xix-p3.2"></span>Amos
testifies: <span id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776) “And it shall come to
pass in that day, saith the Lord, that the sun shall go down at noon,
and the daylight shall be darkened; and I will turn your feasts into
mourning, and your songs into lamentation.” Also <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xix-p4.2"></span>Jeremiah: <span
id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777) “She who brings forth is affrighted,
and vexed in spirit; her sun is gone down while it was yet mid-day; she
hath been ashamed and confounded; <span
id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778) and the residue of them will I give to
the sword in the sight of their enemies.” And the <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xix-p6.2"></span>Sibyl:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.iv.xix-p6.3"></span> “And the veil of the temple
> shall be rent, and at midday there shall be dark vast night for three
> hours,”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xix-p7"></span>When these things were done, even by
the heavenly prodigies, they were not able to understand their crime.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xix-p8"></span>But since He had foretold that on the
third day He should rise again from the dead, fearing lest, the body
having been stolen by the disciples, and removed, all should believe
that He had risen, and there should be a much greater disturbance among
the people, they took Him down from the cross, and having shut Him up in
a tomb, they securely surrounded it with a guard of soldiers. But on the
third day, before light, there was an earthquake, and the sepulchre was
suddenly opened; and the guard, who were astonished and stupefied with
fear, seeing nothing, He came forth uninjured and alive from the
sepulchre, and went into Galilee to seek His disciples: but nothing was
found in the sepulchre except the grave-clothes in which they had
enclosed and wrapt His body. Now, that He would not remain in
hell, <span id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779) but rise again on the
third day, had been foretold by the prophets. <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xix-p9.1"></span>David says, in the fifteenth Psalm: <span
id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780) “Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell;
neither wilt Thou suffer Thine holy one to see corruption.” Also in the
third Psalm: <span id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781) “I laid me down to
sleep, and took my rest, and rose again, for the Lord sustained me.”
<span id="iii.ii.iv.xix-p11.2"></span>Hosea also, the first of the
twelve prophets, testified of His resurrection: <span
id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782) “This my Son is wise, therefore He
will not remain in the anguish of His sons: and I will redeem Him from
the power <span id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783) of the grave. Where is
thy judgment, O death? or where is thy sting?” The same also in another
place: <span id="fr_784"></span>[785](#fn_784) “After two days, He will
revive us in the third day.” And therefore the <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xix-p14.2"></span>Sibyl said, that after three days’ sleep
he would put an end to death:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.iv.xix-p14.3"></span> “And after sleeping three days,
> He shall put an end to the fate of death; and then, releasing Himself
> from the dead, He shall come to light, first showing to the called
> ones the beginning of the resurrection.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xix-p15"></span>For He gained life for us by
overcoming death. No hope, therefore, of gaining immortality is given to
man, unless he shall believe on Him, and shall take up that cross to be
borne and endured.
