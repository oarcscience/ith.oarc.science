#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXIX.—Of the Patience and Providence of God.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxv-p1"></span>But some one says: Why, then, does
the true God permit these things to be done? Why does He not rather
remove or destroy the wicked? Why, in truth, did He from the beginning
give power <span id="fr_1485"></span>[1486](#fn_1485) to the demon, so
that there should be one who might corrupt and destroy all things? I
will briefly say why He willed that this should be so. I ask whether
virtue is a good or an evil. It cannot be denied that it is a good. If
virtue is a good, vice, on the contrary, is an evil. If vice is an evil
on this account, because it opposes virtue, and virtue is on this
account a good, because it overthrows vice, it follows that virtue
cannot exist without vice; and if you take away vice, the merits of
virtue will be taken away. For there can be no victory without an enemy.
Thus it comes to pass, that good cannot exist without an evil.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxv-p3"></span><span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxv-p3.1"></span>Chrysippus, a man of active mind, saw
this when discussing the subject of providence, and charges those with
folly who think that good is caused by God, but say that evil is not
thus caused. <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxv-p3.2"></span>Aulus Gellius <span
id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486) has interpreted his sentiment in
his books of <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxv-p4.1"></span>Attic Nights; thus
saying: “They to whom it does not appear that the world was made for the
sake of God and men, and that human affairs are governed by providence,
think that they use a weighty argument when they thus speak: If there
were a providence, there would be no evils. For they say that nothing is
less in agreement with providence, than that in this world, on account
of which it is said that God made men, <span
id="fr_1487"></span>[1488](#fn_1487) the power of troubles and evils
should be so great. In reply to these things, <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxv-p5.3"></span>Chrysippus, when he was arguing, in his
fourth book respecting providence, said: Nothing can be more foolish
than those who think that good things could have existed, if there were
not evils in the same place. For since good things are contrary to evil,
they must of necessity be opposed to each other, and must stand resting,
as it were, on mutual and opposite support. <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[1489](#fn_1488) Thus there is no contrary without
another contrary. <span id="page_233">p. 233</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxv-Page_233"></span>For how could there be any
perception of justice, unless there were injuries? or what else is
justice, but the removal of injustice? In like manner, the nature of
fortitude cannot be understood, except by placing <span
id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489) beside it cowardice, or the nature
of self-control except by intemperance. Likewise, in what manner would
there be prudence, unless there were the contrary, imprudence? On the
same principle, he says, why do the foolish men not require this also,
that there should be truth and not falsehood? For there exist together
good and evil things, prosperity and trouble, pleasure and pain. For the
one being bound to the other at opposite poles, as <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxv-p7.3"></span>Plato says, if you take away one, you
take away both.” You see, therefore, that which I have often said, that
good and evil are so connected with one another, that the one cannot
exist without the other. Therefore God acted with the greatest foresight
in placing the subject-matter of virtue in evils which He made for this
purpose, that He might establish for us a contest, in which He would
crown the victorious with the reward of immortality. <span
