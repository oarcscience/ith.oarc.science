#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXIX.—Of the Christian Religion, and of the Union of Jesus with the Father.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxix-p1"></span>Some one may perhaps ask how, when
we say that we worship one God only, we nevertheless assert that there
are two, God the Father and God the Son: which assertion has driven many
into the greatest error. For when the things which we say seem to them
probable, they consider that we fail in this one point alone, that we
confess that there is another God, and that He is mortal. We have
already spoken of His mortality: now let us teach concerning His unity.
When we speak of God the Father and God the Son, we do not speak of them
as different, nor do we separate each: because the Father cannot exist
without the Son, nor can the Son be separated from the Father, since the
name of Father <span id="fr_885"></span>[886](#fn_885) cannot be given
without the Son, nor can the Son be begotten without the Father. Since,
therefore, the Father makes the Son, and the Son the Father, they both
have one mind, one spirit, one substance; but the former <span
id="fr_886"></span>[887](#fn_886) is as it were an overflowing fountain,
the latter <span id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887) as a stream flowing
forth from it: the former as the sun, the latter as it were a ray <span
id="fr_888"></span>[889](#fn_888) extended from the sun. And since He is
both faithful to the Most High Father, and beloved by Him, He is not
separated from Him; just as the stream is not separated from the
fountain, nor the ray from the sun: for the water of the fountain is in
the stream, and the light of the sun is in the ray: just as the voice
cannot be separated from the mouth, nor the strength or hand from the
body. When, therefore, He is also spoken of by the prophets as the hand,
and strength, and word of God, there is plainly no separation; for the
tongue, which is the minister of speech, and the hand, in which the
strength is situated, are inseparable portions of the body.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxix-p6"></span>We may use an example more closely
connected with us. When any one has a son whom he especially loves, who
is still in the house, and in the power <span
id="fr_889"></span>[890](#fn_889) of his father, although he concede to
him the name and power of a master, yet by the civil law the house is
one, and one person is called master. So this world <span
id="fr_890"></span>[891](#fn_890) is the one house of God; and the Son
and the Father, who unanimously inhabit the world, are one God, for the
one is as two, and the two are as one. Nor is that wonderful, since the
Son is in the Father, for the Father loves the Son, and the Father is in
the Son; for He faithfully obeys the will of the Father, nor does He
ever do nor has done anything except what the Father either willed or
commanded. Lastly, that the Father and the Son are but one God, <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxix-p8.3"></span>Isaiah showed in that passage which we
have brought forward before, <span id="fr_891"></span>[892](#fn_891)
when he said: <span id="fr_892"></span>[893](#fn_892) “They shall fall
down unto Thee, and make supplication unto Thee, since God is in Thee,
and there is no other God besides Thee.” And he also speaks to the same
purport in another place: <span id="fr_893"></span>[894](#fn_893) “Thus
saith God the King of Israel, and His Redeemer, the everlasting God; I
am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.” When he
had set forth two persons, one of God the King, that is, Christ, and the
other of God the Father, who after His passion raised Him from the dead,
as we have said <span id="fr_894"></span>[895](#fn_894) that the prophet
<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxix-p12.1"></span>Hosea showed, <span
id="fr_895"></span>[896](#fn_895) who said, “I will redeem Him from the
power of the grave:” nevertheless, with reference to each person, he
introduced the words, “and beside me there is no God,” when he might
have said “beside us;” but it was not right that a separation of so
close a relationship should be made by the use of the plural number. For
there is one God alone, free, most high, without any origin; for He
Himself is the origin of all things, and in Him at once both the Son and
all things are contained. Wherefore, since the mind and will of the one
is in the other, or rather, since there is one in both, <span
id="page_133">p. 133</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxix-Page_133"></span>both are justly called one God; for
whatever is in the Father <span id="fr_896"></span>[897](#fn_896) flows
on to the Son, and whatever is in the Son descends from the Father.
Therefore that highest and matchless God cannot be worshipped except
through the Son. He who thinks that he worships the Father only, as he
does not worship the Son, so he does not worship even the Father. But he
who receives the Son, and bears His name, he truly together with the Son
worships the Father also, since the Son is the ambassador, and
messenger, and priest of the Most High Father. He is the door of the
greatest temple, He the way of light, He the guide to salvation, He the
gate of life.
