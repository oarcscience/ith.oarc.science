<p> <a name="vi.ii.xvi"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="vi.ii.xvi-p0.1"></A>from the seventeenth chapter.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.xvi-p1"></A><a name="vi.ii.xvi-p1.1"></A>1&#8211;6. &#8220;There came one of the seven angels, which have the seven bowls, and spake with me, saying, Come, I will show thee the judgment of that great whore who sitteth upon many waters. And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs.&#8221;] The decrees of that senate are always accomplished against all, contrary to the preaching of the true faith; and now already mercy being cast aside, itself here gave the decree among all nations. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.xvi-p2"></A><a name="vi.ii.xvi-p2.1"></A>3. &#8220;And I saw the woman herself sitting upon the scarlet-coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy.&#8221;] But to sit upon the scarlet beast, the author of murders, is the image of the devil. Where also <span><a name="vi.ii.xvi-p2.2"></A>is treated</span> of his captivity, concerning which we have fully considered. I remember, indeed, that this is called Babylon also in the Apocalypse, on account of confusion; and in Isaiah also; and <a name="vi.ii.xvi-p2.3"></A>Ezekiel called it Sodom. In fine, if you compare what is said against Sodom, and what Isaiah says against Babylon, and what the Apocalypse says, you will find that they are all one.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2307"></A><A HREF="#fn_2307"><FONT SIZE="1">2308</FONT></A>
 &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.xvi-p4"></A><a name="vi.ii.xvi-p4.1"></A>9. &#8220;The seven heads are the seven hills, on <A NAME="page_358"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 358</FONT></A> <a name="vi.ii.xvi-Page_358"></A>which the woman sitteth.&#8221;] That is, the city of Rome. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.xvi-p5"></A><a name="vi.ii.xvi-p5.1"></A>10. &#8220;And there are seven kings: five have fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he is come, he will be for a short time.&#8221;] The time must be understood in which the written Apocalypse was published, since then reigned <a name="vi.ii.xvi-p5.2"></A>C&aelig;sar Domitian; but before him had been <a name="vi.ii.xvi-p5.3"></A>Titus his brother, and <a name="vi.ii.xvi-p5.4"></A>Vespasian, <a name="vi.ii.xvi-p5.5"></A>Otho, <a name="vi.ii.xvi-p5.6"></A>Vitellius, and <a name="vi.ii.xvi-p5.7"></A>Galba. These are the five who have fallen. One remains, under whom the Apocalypse was written&#8212;<a name="vi.ii.xvi-p5.8"></A>Domitian, to wit. &#8220;The other has not yet come,&#8221; speaks of <a name="vi.ii.xvi-p5.9"></A>Nerva; &#8220;and when he is come, he will be for a short time,&#8221; for he did not complete the period of two years. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.xvi-p6"></A><a name="vi.ii.xvi-p6.1"></A>11. &#8220;And the beast which thou sawest is of the seven.&#8221;] Since before those kings <a name="vi.ii.xvi-p6.2"></A>Nero reigned. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.xvi-p7"></A>&#8220;And he is the eighth.&#8221;] He says only when this beast shall come, reckon it the eighth place, since in that is the completion. He added:&#8212; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.xvi-p8"></A>&#8220;And shall go into perdition.&#8221;] For that ten kings received royal power when he shall move from the east, he says. He shall be sent from the city of Rome with his armies. And <a name="vi.ii.xvi-p8.1"></A>Daniel sets forth the ten horns and the ten diadems. And that these are eradicated from the former ones,&#8212;that is, that three of the principal leaders are killed by Antichrist: that the other seven give him honour and wisdom and power, of whom he says:&#8212; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.xvi-p9"></A><a name="vi.ii.xvi-p9.1"></A>16. &#8220;These shall hate the whore, to wit, the city, and shall burn her flesh with fire.&#8221;] Now that one of the heads was, as it were, slain to death, and that the stroke of his death was directed, he speaks of <a name="vi.ii.xvi-p9.2"></A>Nero. For it is plain that when the cavalry sent by the senate was pursuing him, he himself cut his throat. Him therefore, when raised up, God will send as a worthy king, but worthy in such a way as the Jews merited. And since he is to have another name, He shall also appoint another name, that so the Jews may receive him as if he were the Christ. Says <a name="vi.ii.xvi-p9.3"></A>Daniel: &#8220;He shall not know the lust of women, although before he was most impure, and he shall know no God of his fathers: for he will not be able to seduce the people of the circumcision, unless he is a judge of the law.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2308"></A><A HREF="#fn_2308"><FONT SIZE="1">2309</FONT></A>
 Finally, also, he will recall the saints, not to the worship of idols, but to undertake circumcision, and, if he is able, to seduce any; for he shall so conduct himself as to be called Christ by them. But that he rises again from hell, we have said above in the word of Isaiah: &#8220;Water shall nourish him, and hell hath increased him;&#8221; who, however, must come with name unchanged, and doings unchanged, as says the Spirit. &#160;</p>
