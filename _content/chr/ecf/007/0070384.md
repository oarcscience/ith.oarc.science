#### <span id="vi.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>from the ninth chapter.

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>13, 14.
“And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is in
the presence of God, saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet,
Loose the four angels.”\] That is, the four corners of the earth which
hold the four winds.  

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p2"></span>“Which are bound in the great river
Euphrates.”\] By the corners of the earth, or the four winds across the
river Euphrates, are <span id="vi.ii.ix-p2.1"></span>meant four nations,
because to every nation is sent an angel; as said the law, “He
determined them by the number of the angels of God,” <span
id="fr_2284"></span>[2285](#fn_2284) until the number of the saints
should be filled up. They do not overpass their bounds, because at the
last they shall come with Antichrist.
