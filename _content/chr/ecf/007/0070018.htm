<p> <a name="iii.ii.i.xiii"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-p0.1"></A>Chap. xii.&#8212;that the stoics transfer the figments of the poets to a philosophical system.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-p1"></A>Since we have brought to light the mysteries of the poets, and have found out the parents of <a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-p1.1"></A>Saturn, let us return to his virtues and actions. He was, <span><a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-p1.2"></A>they say</span>, just in his rule. First, from this very circumstance he is not now a god, inasmuch as he has ceased to be. In the next place, he was not even just, but impious not only towards his sons, whom he devoured, but also towards his father, whom he is said to have mutilated. And this may perhaps have happened in truth. But men, having regard to the element which is called the heaven, reject the whole fable as most foolishly invented; though the Stoics, (according to their custom) endeavour to transfer it to a physical system, whose opinion <a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-p1.3"></A>Cicero has laid down in his treatise concerning the Nature of the Gods. They held, he says, that the highest and ethereal nature of heaven, that is, of fire, which by itself produced all things, was without that part of the body which contained the productive organs. Now this theory might have been suitable to <a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-p1.4"></A>Vesta, if she were called a male. For it is on this account that they esteem Vesta to be a virgin, inasmuch as fire is an incorruptible element; and nothing can be born from it, since it consumes all things, whatever it has seized upon. <a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-p1.5"></A>Ovid in the <a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-p1.6"></A>Fasti says:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_59"><FONT SIZE="1">60</FONT></A>
 &#8220;Nor do you esteem Vesta to be anything else than a living flame; and you see no bodies produced from flame. Therefore she is truly a virgin, for she sends forth no seed, nor receives it, and loves the attendants of virginity.&#8221; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-p3"></A>This also might have been ascribed to <a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-p3.1"></A>Vulcan, who indeed is supposed to be fire, and yet the poets did not mutilate him. It might also have been ascribed to the sun, in whom is the nature and cause of the productive powers. For without the fiery heat of the sun nothing could be born, or have increase; so that no other element has greater need of productive organs than heat, by the nourishment of which all things are conceived, produced, and supported. Lastly, even if the case were as they would have it, why should we suppose that <a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-p3.2"></A>C&#339;lus was mutilated, rather than that he was born without productive organs? For if he produces by himself, it is plain that he had no need of productive organs, since he gave birth to <a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-p3.3"></A>Saturn himself; but if he had them, and suffered mutilation from his son, the origin of all things and all nature would have perished. Why should I say that they deprive Saturn himself not only of divine, but also of human intelligence, when they affirm that Saturn is he who comprises the course and change of the spaces and seasons, and that he has that very <A NAME="page_25"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 25</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-Page_25"></A>name in Greek? For he is called <a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-p3.4"></A>Cronos, which is the same as Chronos, that is, a space of time. But he is called Saturn, because he is satiated with years. These are the words of <a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-p3.5"></A>Cicero, setting forth the opinion of the Stoics: &#8220;The worthlessness of these things any one may readily understand. For if Saturn is the son of C&#339;lus, how could Time have been born from C&#339;lus, or C&#339;lus have been mutilated by Time, or afterwards could Time have been despoiled of his sovereignty by his son <a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-p3.6"></A>Jupiter? Or how was <a name="iii.ii.i.xiii-p3.7"></A>Jupiter born from Time? Or with what years could eternity be satiated, since it has no limit?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A>
