<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xi-p1"></A>But respecting the king and father of all these, <a name="iii.ii.viii.xi-p1.1"></A>Jupiter, whom they believe to possess the chief power in heaven,&#8212;what power&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1464"></A><A HREF="#fn_1464"><FONT SIZE="1">1465</FONT></A>
 had he, who banished his father <a name="iii.ii.viii.xi-p2.3"></A>Saturnus from his kingdom, and pursued him with arms when he fled? What self-restraint had he, who indulged every kind of lust? For he made <a name="iii.ii.viii.xi-p2.4"></A>Alcmena and <a name="iii.ii.viii.xi-p2.5"></A>Leda, the wives of great men, infamous through his adultery: he also, captivated with the beauty of a boy, carried him off with violence as he was hunting and meditating manly things, that he might treat him as a woman. Why should I mention his debaucheries of virgins? and how great a multitude of these there was, is shown by the number of his sons. In the case of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xi-p2.6"></A>Thetis alone he was more temperate. For it bad been predicted that the son whom she should bring forth would be more powerful than his father. Therefore he struggled with his love, that one might not be born greater than himself. He knew, therefore, that he was not of perfect virtue, greatness, and power, since he feared that which he himself had done to his father. Why, therefore, is he called best and greatest, since he both contaminated himself with faults, which is the part of one who is unjust and bad, and feared a greater than himself, which is the part of one who is weak and inferior? &#160;</p>
