<p> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xxiii"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p0.1"></A>Chap. XXIII.&#8212;Of the Resurrection of the Soul, and the Proofs of This Fact.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p1"></A>Therefore they will not be born again, which is impossible, but they will rise again, and be clothed by God with bodies, and will remember their former life, and all its actions; and being placed in the possession of heavenly goods, and enjoying the pleasure of innumerable resources, they will give thanks to God in His immediate presence, because He has destroyed all evil, and because He has raised them to His kingdom and to perpetual life. Respecting which resurrection the philosophers also attempted to speak as corruptly as the poets. For <a name="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p1.1"></A>Pythagoras asserted that souls passed into new bodies; but foolishly, that they passed from men into cattle, and from cattle into men; and that he himself was restored from <a name="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p1.2"></A>Euphorbus. <a name="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p1.3"></A>Chrysippus says better, whom <a name="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p1.4"></A>Cicero speaks of as supporting the portico of the Stoics, who, in the books which he wrote concerning providence, when he was speaking of the renewing of the world, introduced these words: &#8220;But since this is so, it is evident that nothing is impossible, and that we, after our death, when certain periods of time have again come round, are restored to this state in which we now are.&#8221; But let us return from human to divine things. The <a name="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p1.5"></A>Sibyl thus speaks:&#8212;<A NAME="page_215"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 215</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-Page_215"></A> &#160;</p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p1.6"></A>   &#8220;For the whole race of mortals is hard to be believed; but when the judgment of the world and of mortals shall now come, which God Himself shall institute, judging the impious and the holy at the same time, then at length He shall send the wicked to darkness in fire. But as many as are holy shall live again on the earth, God giving them at the same time a spirit, and honour, and life.&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>  
<p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p2"></A>But if not only prophets, but even bards, and poets, and philosophers, agree that there will be a resurrection of the dead, let no one ask of us how this is possible: for no reason can be assigned for divine works; but if from the beginning God formed man in some unspeakable manner, we may believe that the old man can be restored by Him who made the new man. &#160;</p>
