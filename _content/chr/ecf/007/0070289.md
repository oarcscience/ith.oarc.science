#### <span id="iii.iv.ii-p0.1"></span>Chap. II.—Of the Production of the Beasts and of Man.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p1"></span>For our Creator and Parent, God, has
given to man perception and reason, that it might be evident from this
that we are descended from Him, because He Himself is intelligence, He
Himself is perception and reason. Since He did not give that power of
reason to the other animals, He provided beforehand in what manner their
life might be more safe. For He clothed them all with their own natural
hair, <span id="fr_1809"></span>[1810](#fn_1809) in order that they
might more easily be able to endure the severity of frosts and colds.
Moreover, He has appointed to every kind its own peculiar defence for
the repelling of attacks from without; so that they may either oppose
the stronger animals with natural weapons, or the feebler ones may
withdraw themselves from danger by the swiftness of their flight, or
those which require at once both strength and swiftness may protect
themselves by craft, or guard themselves in hiding-places. <span
id="fr_1810"></span>[1811](#fn_1810) And so others of them either poise
themselves aloft with light plumage, or are supported by hoofs, <span
id="fr_1811"></span>[1812](#fn_1811) or are furnished with horns; some
have arms in their mouth—namely, their teeth <span
id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812) —or hooked talons on their feet;
and none of them is destitute of a defence for its own protection.  

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p6"></span>But if any fall as a prey to the greater
animals, that their race might not utterly perish, they have either been
banished to that region where the greater ones cannot exist, or they
have received a more abundant fruitfulness in production, that food
might be supplied from them to the beasts which are nourished by blood,
and yet their very multitude might survive the slaughter inflicted upon
them, so as to preserve the race. <span
id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813) But He made man—reason being
granted to him, and the power of perceiving and speaking being given to
him—destitute of those things which are given to the other animals,
because wisdom was able to supply those things which the condition of
nature had denied to him. He made him naked and defenceless, because he
could be armed by his talent, and clothed by his reason. <span
id="fr_1814"></span>[1815](#fn_1814) But it cannot be expressed how
wonderfully the absence of those things which are given to the brutes
contributes to the beauty of man. For if He had given to man the teeth
of wild beasts, or horns, or claws, or hoofs, or a tail, or hairs of
various colour, who cannot perceive how misshapen an animal he would be,
as the dumb animals, if they were made naked and defenceless? For if you
take from these the natural clothing of their body, or those things by
which they are armed of themselves, they can be neither beautiful nor
safe, so that they appear wonderfully furnished if you think of utility,
and wonderfully adorned if you think of appearance: in such a wonderful
manner is utility combined with beauty.  

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p9"></span>But with reference to man, whom He
formed<span id="page_283">p. 283</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii-Page_283"></span> an eternal and immortal being, He did
not arm him, as the others, without, but within; nor did He place his
protection in the body, but in the soul: since it would have been
superfluous, when He had given him that which was of the greatest value,
to cover him with bodily defences, especially when they hindered the
beauty of the human body. On which account I am accustomed to wonder at
the senselessness of the philosophers who follow <span
id="iii.iv.ii-p9.1"></span>Epicurus, who blame the works of nature, that
they may show that the world is prepared and governed by no
providence; <span id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815) but they ascribe
the origin of all things to indivisible and solid bodies, from the
fortuitous meetings of which they say that all things are and were
produced. I pass by the things relating to the work itself with which
they find fault, in which matter they are ridiculously mad; I assume
that which belongs to the subject of which we are now treating.
