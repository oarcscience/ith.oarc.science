#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxvii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XLI.—Of True Religion and Wisdom.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxvii-p1"></span>Now, since we have refuted false
religion, which is in the worship of the gods, and false wisdom, which
is in the philosophers, let us come to true religion and wisdom. And,
indeed, we must speak of them both conjointly, because they are closely
connected. For to worship the true God, that and nothing else is wisdom.
For that God who is supreme and the Maker of all things, who made man as
the image of Himself, on this account conferred on him alone of all
animals the gift of reason, that he might pay back honour to Him as his
Father and his Lord, and by the exercise of this piety and obedience
might gain the reward of immortality. This is a true and divine mystery.
But among those, <span id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510) because they
are not true, there is no agreement. Neither are sacred rites performed
in philosophy, nor is philosophy treated of in sacred things; and on
this account their religion is false, because it does not possess
wisdom; and on this account their wisdom is false, because it does not
possess religion. But where both are joined together, there the truth
must necessarily be; so that if it is asked what the truth itself is, it
may be rightly said to be either wise religion or religious wisdom.
