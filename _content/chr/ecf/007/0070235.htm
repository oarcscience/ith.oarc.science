<p> <a name="iii.ii.viii.xliii"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xliii-p0.1"></A>Chap. XLVII.&#8212;Of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Sending of the Apostles, and the Ascension of the Saviour into Heaven.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xliii-p1"></A>After these things they took His body down from the cross, and buried it in a tomb. But on the third day, before daybreak, there was an earthquake, and the stone with which they had closed the sepulchre was removed, and He arose. But nothing was found in the sepulchre except the clothes in which the body had been wrapped.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1545"></A><A HREF="#fn_1545"><FONT SIZE="1">1546</FONT></A>
 But that He would rise again on the third day, the prophets had long ago foretold. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xliii-p2.2"></A>David, in the xvth Psalm:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1546"></A><A HREF="#fn_1546"><FONT SIZE="1">1547</FONT></A>
 &#8220;Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption.&#8221; Likewise <a name="iii.ii.viii.xliii-p3.2"></A>Hosea:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1547"></A><A HREF="#fn_1547"><FONT SIZE="1">1548</FONT></A>
 This my Son is wise, therefore He shall not stay long in the anguish of His sons: and I will ransom Him from the hand of the grave. Where is thy judgment, O death, where is thy sting? &#8220;The same again says:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1548"></A><A HREF="#fn_1548"><FONT SIZE="1">1549</FONT></A>
 &#8220;After two days He will revive us on the third day.&#8221; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xliii-p6"></A>Therefore, after His resurrection He went into Galilee, and again assembled His disciples, who had fled through fear; and having given them commands which He wished to be observed, and having arranged for the preaching of the Gospel throughout the whole world, He breathed into them the Holy Spirit,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1549"></A><A HREF="#fn_1549"><FONT SIZE="1">1550</FONT></A>
 and gave them the power of working miracles, that they might act for the welfare of men as well by deeds as words; and then at length, on the fortieth day, He returned to His Father, being carried up into a cloud. The prophet <a name="iii.ii.viii.xliii-p7.1"></A>Daniel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1550"></A><A HREF="#fn_1550"><FONT SIZE="1">1551</FONT></A>
 had long before shown this, saying, &#8220;I saw in the night vision, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days; and they who stood beside Him brought Him near before Him. And there was given Him a kingdom, and glory, and dominion, and all people, tribes, and languages shall serve Him; and His power is an everlasting one, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.&#8221; Also <a name="iii.ii.viii.xliii-p8.2"></A>David in the cixth Psalm:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1551"></A><A HREF="#fn_1551"><FONT SIZE="1">1552</FONT></A>
 &#8220;The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.&#8221; &#160;</p>
