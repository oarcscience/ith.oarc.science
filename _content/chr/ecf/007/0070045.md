#### <span id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XV.—Of the Corruption of Angels, and the Two Kinds of Demons.

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p1"></span>When, therefore, the number of men had
begun to increase, God in His forethought, lest the devil, to whom from
the beginning He had given power over the earth, should by his subtilty
either corrupt or destroy men, as he had done at first, sent angels for
the protection and improvement <span id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316)
of the human race; and inasmuch as He had given these a free will, He
enjoined them above all things not to defile themselves with
contamination from the earth, and thus lose the dignity of their
heavenly nature. <span id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317) He plainly
prohibited them from doing that which He knew that they would do, that
they might entertain no hope of pardon. Therefore, while they abode
among men, that most deceitful ruler <span
id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318) of the earth, by his very association,
gradually enticed them to vices, and polluted them by intercourse with
women. Then, not being admitted into heaven on account of the sins into
which they had plunged themselves, they fell to the earth. Thus from
angels the devil makes them to become his satellites and attendants. But
they who were born from these, because they were neither angels nor men,
but bearing a kind of mixed <span id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319)
nature, were not admitted into hell, as their fathers were not into
heaven. Thus there came to be two kinds of demons; one of heaven, the
other of the earth. The latter are the wicked <span
id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320) spirits, the authors of all the evils
which are done, and the same devil is their prince. Whence <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p6.1"></span>Trismegistus calls him the ruler of the
demons. But grammarians say that they are called demons, as though <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p6.2"></span>dœmones, <span
id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321) that is, skilled and acquainted with
matters: for they think that these are gods. They are acquainted,
indeed, with many future events, but not all, since it is not permitted
them entirely to know the counsel of God; and therefore they are
accustomed to accommodate <span id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322) their
answers to ambiguous results. The poets both know them to be demons, and
so describe them. <span id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p8.1"></span>Hesiod thus
speaks:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p8.2"></span> “These are the demons according
> to the will of <span id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p8.4"></span>Zeus, Good, living
> on the earth, the guardians of mortal men.”  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p9"></span>And this is said for this purpose,
because God had sent them as guardians to the human race; but they
themselves also, though they are the destroyers of men, yet wish
themselves to appear as their guardians, that they themselves may be
worshipped, and God may not be worshipped. The philosophers also discuss
the subject of these beings. For <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p9.1"></span>Plato attempted even to explain their
natures in his “Banquet;” and <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p9.2"></span>Socrates said that there was a demon
continually about him, who had become attached to him when a boy, by
whose will and direction his life was guided. The art also and power of
the Magi altogether consists in the influences <span
id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323) of these; invoked by whom they deceive
the sight of men with deceptive illusions, <span
id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324) so that they do not see those things
which exist, and think that they see those things which do not exist.
These contaminated and abandoned spirits, as I say, wander over the
whole earth, and contrive a solace for their own perdition by the
destruction of men. Therefore they fill every place with snares,
deceits, frauds, and errors; for they cling to individuals, and occupy
whole houses from door to door, and assume to themselves the name of
<span class="Foreign"><span
id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p11.1"></span>genii</span><span
id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p11.2"></span>; for by this word they translate demons
in the Latin language. They consecrate these in their houses, to these
they daily pour out <span id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325) libations of
wine, and worship the wise demons as gods of the earth, and as averters
of those evils which they themselves cause and impose. And these, since
spirits are without substance <span id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326)
and not to be grasped, insinuate themselves into the bodies of men; and
secretly working in their inward parts, they corrupt the health, hasten
diseases, terrify their souls with dreams, harass their minds with
phrenzies, that by these evils they may compel men to have recourse to
their aid.

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p13"></span> Thin, unsubstantial, as opposed to
corporeal. The ancients inclined to the opinion that angels had a body,
not like that of man, but of a slight and more subtle nature. Probably
<span id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p13.1"></span>Lactantius refers to this idea in
using the word <span class="Foreign"><span
id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p13.2"></span>tenuis</span>. How opposed this view is
to Scripture is manifest. \[Not so <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p13.3"></span>manifest as our translator supposes. I do
not assert what <span id="iii.ii.ii.xv-p13.4"></span>Lactantius says to
be scripturally correct: but it certainly is not <span

them; whether figuratively or otherwise, I do not venture a
suggestion.\]
