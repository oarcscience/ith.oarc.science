<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xx-p1"></A><a name="iii.v.xx-p1.1"></A>Galerius having effected the expulsion of the two old men, began to consider himself alone as the sovereign of the Roman empire. Necessity had required the appointment of <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.2"></A>Constantius to the first rank; but <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.3"></A>Galerius made small account of one who was of an easy temper, and of health declining and precarious. He looked for the speedy death of <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.4"></A>Constantius. And although that prince should recover, it seemed not difficult to force him to put off the imperial purple; for what else could he do, if pressed by his three colleagues to abdicate? <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.5"></A>Galerius had <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.6"></A>Licinius ever about his person, his old and intimate acquaintance, and his earliest companion in arms, whose counsels he used in the management of all affairs; yet he would not nominate Licinius to the dignity of <span><a name="iii.v.xx-p1.7"></A>C&aelig;sar</span>, with the title of <span><a name="iii.v.xx-p1.8"></A>son</span>, for he purposed to nominate him, in the room of <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.9"></A>Constantius, to the dignity of <span><a name="iii.v.xx-p1.10"></A>emperor</span>, with the title of <span><a name="iii.v.xx-p1.11"></A>brother</span>, while he himself might hold sovereign authority, and rule over the whole globe with unbounded licence. After that, he meant to have solemnized the <span><a name="iii.v.xx-p1.12"></A>vicennial</span> festival; to have conferred on his son <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.13"></A>Candidianus, then a boy of nine years of age, the office of <span><a name="iii.v.xx-p1.14"></A>C&aelig;sar</span>; and, in conclusion, to have resigned, as <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.15"></A>Diocletian had done. And thus, <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.16"></A>Licinius and <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.17"></A>Severus being emperors, and <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.18"></A>Maximin and <a name="iii.v.xx-p1.19"></A>Candidianus in the next station of <span><a name="iii.v.xx-p1.20"></A>C&aelig;sars</span>, he fancied that, environed as it were by an impregnable wall, he should lead an old age of security and peace. Such were his projects; but God, whom he had made his adversary, frustrated all those imaginations. &#160;</p>
