#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXXV.—That Immortality is the Chief Good.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxi-p1"></span>What, then, will be the advantage
of justice and virtue, if they shall have nothing but evil in life? But
if virtue, which despises all earthly goods, most wisely endures all
evils, and endures death itself in the discharge of duty, cannot be
without a reward, what remains but that immortality alone is its reward?
For if a happy life falls to the lot of man, as the philosophers will
have it, and in this point alone they do not disagree, therefore also
immortality falls to him. For that only is happy which is incorruptible;
that only is incorruptible which is eternal. Therefore immortality is
the chief good, because it belongs both to man, and to the soul, and to
virtue. We are only directed to this; we are born to the attainment of
this. Therefore God proposes to us virtue and justice, that we may
obtain that eternal reward for our labours. But concerning that
immortality <span id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497) itself we will
speak in the proper place. There remains the philosophy of Logic, <span
id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498) which contributes nothing to a
happy life. For wisdom does not consist in the arrangement of speech,
but in the heart and the feeling. But if natural philosophy is
superfluous, and this of logic, and the philosophers have erred in moral
philosophy, which alone is necessary, because they have been unable in
any way to find out the chief good; therefore all philosophy is found to
be empty and useless, which was unable to comprehend the nature of man,
or to fulfil its duty and office.
