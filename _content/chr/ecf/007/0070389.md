#### <span id="vi.ii.xiv-p0.1"></span>from the fourteenth chapter.

<span id="vi.ii.xiv-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>6. “And
I saw an angel flying through the midst of heaven.”\] The angel flying
through the midst of heaven, whom he says that he saw, we have already
treated of above, as being the same <span
id="vi.ii.xiv-p1.2"></span>Elias who anticipates the kingdom of
Antichrist in his prophecy.  

<span id="vi.ii.xiv-p2"></span><span id="vi.ii.xiv-p2.1"></span>8. “And
another angel following him.”\] The other angel following, he speaks of
as the same prophet who is the associate of his prophesying. But that he
says,—  

<span id="vi.ii.xiv-p3"></span><span id="vi.ii.xiv-p3.1"></span>15.
“Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather in the grapes of the vine,”\] he
signifies it of the nations that should perish on the advent of the
Lord. And indeed in many forms he shows this same thing, as if to the
dry harvest, and the seed for the coming of the Lord, and the
consummation of the world, and the kingdom of Christ, and the future
appearance of the kingdom of the blessed.  

<span id="vi.ii.xiv-p4"></span><span id="vi.ii.xiv-p4.1"></span>19, 20.
“And the angel thrust in the sickle, and reaped the vine of the earth,
and cast it into the wine-press of the wrath of God. And the wine-press
of His fury was trodden down without the city.”\] In that he says that
it was cast into the wine-press of the wrath of God, and trodden down
without the city, the treading of the wine-press is the retribution on
the sinner.  

<span id="vi.ii.xiv-p5"></span>“And blood went out from the wine-press,
even unto the horse-bridles.”\] The vengeance of shed blood as was
before predicted, “In blood thou hast sinned, and blood shall follow
thee.” <span id="fr_2306"></span>[2307](#fn_2306)  

<span id="vi.ii.xiv-p7"></span>“For a thousand and six hundred
furlongs.”\] That is, through all the four parts of the world: for there
is a quadrate put together by fours, as in four faces and four
appearances, and wheels by fours; for forty times four is one thousand
six hundred. Repeating the same persecution, the Apocalypse says:—
