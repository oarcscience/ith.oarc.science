#### <span id="viii.iii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX. <span id="fr_2453"></span>[2454](#fn_2453) —The Thanksgiving (Eucharist).

<span id="viii.iii.ix-p2"></span>1. Now concerning the Thanksgiving
(Eucharist), thus give thanks. 2. First, concerning the <span
id="page_380">p. 380</span> <span
id="viii.iii.ix-Page_380"></span>cup: <span
id="fr_2454"></span>[2455](#fn_2454) We thank thee, our Father, for the
holy vine of <span id="viii.iii.ix-p3.3"></span>David Thy servant, <span
id="fr_2455"></span>[2456](#fn_2455) which Thou madest known to us
through <span id="viii.iii.ix-p4.4"></span>Jesus Thy Servant; to Thee be
the glory for ever. 3. And concerning the broken <span
id="viii.iii.ix-p4.5"></span>bread: <span
id="fr_2456"></span>[2457](#fn_2456) We thank Thee, our Father, for the
life and knowledge which Thou madest known to us through <span
id="viii.iii.ix-p5.3"></span>Jesus Thy Servant; to Thee be the glory for
ever. 4. Even as this broken <span id="viii.iii.ix-p5.4"></span>bread
was scattered over the hills, <span id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457)
and was gathered together and became one, so let Thy Church be gathered
together from the ends of the earth into Thy kingdom; <span
id="fr_2458"></span>[2459](#fn_2458) for Thine is the glory and the
power through <span id="viii.iii.ix-p7.2"></span>Jesus Christ for ever.
5. But let no one eat or drink of your Thanksgiving (Eucharist), but
they who have been baptized into the name of the Lord; for concerning
this also the Lord hath said, Give not that which is holy to the
dogs. <span id="fr_2459"></span>[2460](#fn_2459)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2453"></span>[379:2454](0070417.htm#fr_2453) <span
id="viii.iii.ix-p0.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.ix-p1"></span> The eucharistic prayers of this and
the following chapter are only partially reproduced in <span
id="viii.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 25, 26; that
of verse 2 has no parallel.  

<span id="fn_2454"></span>[380:2455](0070417.htm#fr_2454) <span
id="viii.iii.ix-p2.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.ix-p3"></span> This is a variation from the order of
the New Testament and of all liturgies: probably this led to its
omission in <span id="viii.iii.ix-p3.1"></span>Apostolic Constitutions.
The word “for” may be substituted for “concerning” here and in verse 3.
\[Possibly a <span id="viii.iii.ix-p3.2"></span>response for
recipients.\]  

<span id="fn_2455"></span>[380:2456](0070417.htm#fr_2455) <span
id="viii.iii.ix-p3.4"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.ix-p4"></span> Peculiar to this passage, but derived
from a common scriptural figure and from the paschal formula. Comp.
especially [John xv. 1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001)<span
id="viii.iii.ix-p4.1"></span>; [Matt. xxvi.
29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029)<span id="viii.iii.ix-p4.2"></span>;
[Mark xiv. 25](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#025)<span
id="viii.iii.ix-p4.3"></span>.  

<span id="fn_2456"></span>[380:2457](0070417.htm#fr_2456) <span
id="viii.iii.ix-p4.6"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.ix-p5"></span> The word <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.ix-p5.1"></span>κλάσμα</span> is found in the accounts of
the feeding of the multitude ([Matt. xiv.
20](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#020)<span id="viii.iii.ix-p5.2"></span>,
xv. 37, and parallels); it was naturally applied to the broken bread of
the Eucharist.  

<span id="fn_2457"></span>[380:2458](0070417.htm#fr_2457) <span
id="viii.iii.ix-p5.5"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.ix-p6"></span> This reference to “hills,” or
“mountains,” is used as an argument against the Egyptian origin of the
Teaching.  

<span id="fn_2458"></span>[380:2459](0070417.htm#fr_2458) <span
id="viii.iii.ix-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.ix-p7"></span> This part of the verse is found in
<span id="viii.iii.ix-p7.1"></span>Apostolic Constitutions. Schaff
properly calls attention to the distinction here made between “Thy
Church” and “Thy kingdom.”  

<span id="fn_2459"></span>[380:2460](0070417.htm#fr_2459) <span
id="viii.iii.ix-p7.3"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.ix-p8"></span> [Matt. vii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006)<span id="viii.iii.ix-p8.1"></span>.
