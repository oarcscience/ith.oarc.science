<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.lxix-p1"></A>Wherefore, since all these things are true and certain, in harmony with the predicted announcement of the prophets, since <a name="iii.ii.viii.lxix-p1.1"></A>Trismegistus and <a name="iii.ii.viii.lxix-p1.2"></A>Hystaspes and the <a name="iii.ii.viii.lxix-p1.3"></A>Sibyls have foretold the same things, it cannot be doubted that all hope of life and salvation is placed in the religion of God alone.
