#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIII.—The Actions of Jupiter are Related from the Historian Euhemerus.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p1"></span>But let us leave the poets; let us
come to history, which is supported both by the credibility of the facts
and by the antiquity of the times. <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Euhemerus was a Messenian, a very
ancient writer, who gave an account of the origin of <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p1.2"></span>Jupiter, and his exploits, and all his
posterity, gathered from the sacred inscriptions of ancient temples; he
also traced out the parents of the other gods, their countries, actions,
commands, and deaths, and even their sepulchres. And this history <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p1.3"></span>Ennius translated into Latin, whose
words are these:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p1.4"></span> “As these things are written,
> so is the origin and kindred of <span
> id="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p1.6"></span>Jupiter and his brothers; after this
> manner it is handed clown to us in the sacred writing.”  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p2"></span>The same <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p2.1"></span>Euhemerus therefore relates that <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p2.2"></span>Jupiter, when he had five times gone
round the world, and had distributed governments to his friends and
relatives, and had given laws to men, and had wrought many other
benefits, being endued with immortal glory and everlasting remembrance,
ended his life in Crete, and departed to the gods, and that his
sepulchre is in Crete, in the town of Gnossus, and that upon it is
engraved in ancient Greek letters Zankronou, which is <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p2.3"></span>Jupiter the son of <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xiv-p2.4"></span>Saturnus. It is plain, therefore, from
the things which I have related, that he was a man, and reigned on the
earth.
