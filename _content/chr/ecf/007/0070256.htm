<p> <a name="iii.ii.viii.lxiv"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.viii.lxiv-p0.1"></A>Chap. LXVIII.&#8212;Of the World, Man, and the Providence of God.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.lxiv-p1"></A>Let us therefore consider what was the plan of making this so great and so immense a work. God made the world, as <a name="iii.ii.viii.lxiv-p1.1"></A>Plato thought, but he does not show why He made it. Because He is good, he says, and envying no one, He made the things which are good. But we see that there are both good and evil things in the system of nature. Some perverse person may stand forth, such as that atheist <a name="iii.ii.viii.lxiv-p1.2"></A>Theodorus was, and answer <a name="iii.ii.viii.lxiv-p1.3"></A>Plato: Nay, because He is evil, He made the things which are evil. How will he refute him? If God made the things which are good, whence have such great evils burst forth, which, for the most part, even prevail over those which are good? They were contained, he says, in the matter. If there were evil, therefore there were also good things; so that either God made nothing, or if He made only good things, the evil things which were not made are more eternal than <A NAME="page_252"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 252</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.viii.lxiv-Page_252"></A>the good things which had a beginning. Therefore the things which at one time began will have an end, and those which always existed will be permanent. Therefore evils are preferable. But if they cannot be preferable, they cannot indeed be more eternal. Therefore they either always existed, and God has been inactive,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1595"></A><A HREF="#fn_1595"><FONT SIZE="1">1596</FONT></A>
 or they both flowed from one source. For it is more in accordance with reason that God made all things, than that He made nothing. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.lxiv-p3"></A>Therefore, according to the sentiments of <a name="iii.ii.viii.lxiv-p3.1"></A>Plato, the same God is both good, because He made good things, and evil, because He made evil things. And if this cannot be so, it is evident that the world was not made by God on this account, because He is good. For He comprised all things, both good and evil; nor did He make anything for its own sake, but on account of something else. A house is built not for this purpose only, that there may be a house, but that it may receive and shelter an inhabitant. Likewise a ship is built not for this purpose, that it may appear only to be a ship, but that men may be able to sail in it. Vessels also are made, not only that the vessels may exist, but that they may receive things which are necessary for use. Thus also God must have made the world for some use. The Stoics say that it was made for the sake of men; and rightly so. For men enjoy all these good things which the world contains in itself. But they do not explain why men themselves were made, or what advantage Providence, the Maker of all things, has in them. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.lxiv-p4"></A><a name="iii.ii.viii.lxiv-p4.1"></A>Plato also affirms that souls are immortal, but why, or in what manner, or at what time, or by whose instrumentality they attain to immortality, or what is the nature of that great mystery, why those who are about to become immortal are previously born mortal, and then, having completed the course&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1596"></A><A HREF="#fn_1596"><FONT SIZE="1">1597</FONT></A>
 of their temporal life, and having laid aside the covering&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1597"></A><A HREF="#fn_1597"><FONT SIZE="1">1598</FONT></A>
 of their frail bodies, are transferred to that eternal blessedness,&#8212;of all this he has no comprehension. Finally, he did not explain the judgment of God, nor the distinction between the just and the unjust, but supposed that the souls which have plunged themselves into crimes are condemned thus far, that they may be reproduced in the lower animals, and thus atone for their offences, until they again return to the forms of men, and that this is always taking place, and that there is no end of this transmigration. In my opinion, he introduces some sport resembling a dream, in which there appears to be neither plan, nor government of God, nor any design. &#160;</p>
