#### <span id="viii.iii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI. <span id="fr_2434"></span>[2435](#fn_2434) —Against False Teachers, and Food Offered to Idols.

<span id="viii.iii.vi-p2"></span>1. See that no one cause thee to
err <span id="fr_2435"></span>[2436](#fn_2435) from this way of the
Teaching, since apart from God it teacheth thee. 2. For if thou art able
to bear all the yoke <span id="fr_2436"></span>[2437](#fn_2436) of the
Lord, thou wilt be perfect; but if thou art not able, what thou art able
that do. 3. And concerning food, <span
id="fr_2437"></span>[2438](#fn_2437) bear what thou art able; but
against that which is sacrificed to idols <span
id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438) be exceedingly on thy guard; for it
is the service of dead gods. <span id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439)

<span id="fn_2434"></span>[379:2435](0070414.htm#fr_2434) <span
id="viii.iii.vi-p0.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.vi-p1"></span> Of this chapter, two phrases and one
entire clause are found in <span id="viii.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Apostolic
Constitutions, vii. 19–21.  

<span id="fn_2435"></span>[379:2436](0070414.htm#fr_2435) <span
id="viii.iii.vi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.vi-p3"></span> Comp. Matt. xxiv . 4 (Greek); Revised
Version, “lead you astray:” <span id="viii.iii.vi-p3.1"></span>Apostolic
Constitutions, vii. 19.  

<span id="fn_2436"></span>[379:2437](0070414.htm#fr_2436) <span
id="viii.iii.vi-p3.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.vi-p4"></span> Or, “the whole yoke.” Those who accept
the Jewish-Christian authorship refer this to the ceremonial law. It
seems quite as likely to mean ascetic regulations. Of these there are
many traces, even in the New-Testament churches.  

<span id="fn_2437"></span>[379:2438](0070414.htm#fr_2437) <span
id="viii.iii.vi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.vi-p5"></span> <span
id="viii.iii.vi-p5.1"></span>Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 20, begins
with a similar phrase, but is explicitly against asceticism in this
respect. The precepts here do not indicate any such spirit as that
opposed by <span id="viii.iii.vi-p5.2"></span>Paul.  

<span id="fn_2438"></span>[379:2439](0070414.htm#fr_2438) <span
id="viii.iii.vi-p5.3"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.vi-p6"></span> Comp. [Acts
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020),
[29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#029)<span
id="viii.iii.vi-p6.1"></span>; [1 Cor. viii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004)<span id="viii.iii.vi-p6.2"></span>,
etc., x. 18, etc. ([Rom. xiv. 20](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#020)<span
id="viii.iii.vi-p6.3"></span> refers to ascetic abstinence.) This
prohibition had a necessary permanence; comp. <span
id="viii.iii.vi-p6.4"></span>Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 21.  

<span id="fn_2439"></span>[379:2440](0070414.htm#fr_2439) <span
id="viii.iii.vi-p6.5"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.vi-p7"></span> Comp. the same phrase in 2 Clement,
iii. This chapter closes the first part of the Teaching, that supposed
to be intended for catechumens. The absence of doctrinal statement does
not necessarily prove the existence of a circle of Gentile Christians
where the Pauline theology was unknown. If such a circle existed,
emphasizing the ethical side of Christianity to the exclusion of its
doctrinal basis, it disappeared very soon. From the nature of the case,
that kind of Christianity is intellectually weak and necessarily
short-lived.
