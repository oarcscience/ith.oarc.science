 And of the Institutions.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.i-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iii.ii.viii.i-p2.1"></A>Although</span> the books of the <a name="iii.ii.viii.i-p2.2"></A>Divine Institutions which we wrote a long time since to illustrate the truth and religion, may so prepare and mould the minds of the readers, that their length may not produce disgust, nor their copiousness be burthensome; nevertheless you desire, O brother <a name="iii.ii.viii.i-p2.3"></A>Pentadius, that an epitome of them should be made for you, I suppose for this reason, that I may write something to you, and that your name may be rendered famous by my work, such as it is. I will comply with your desire, although it seems a difficult matter to comprise within the compass of one book those things which have been treated of in seven large volumes.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1445"></A><A HREF="#fn_1445"><FONT SIZE="1">1446</FONT></A>
 For the whole matter becomes less full when so great a multitude of subjects is to be compressed within a narrow space; and it becomes less clear by its very brevity, especially since many arguments and examples, on which the elucidation of the proofs depends, must of necessity be omitted, since their copiousness is so great, that even by themselves they are enough to make up a book. And when these are removed, what can appear useful, what plain? But I will strive as much as the subject permits, both to contract that which is diffuse and to shorten that which is long; in such a manner, however, that in this work, in which truth is to be brought to light, matter may not seem to be wanting for copiousness, nor clearness for understanding it.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1446"></A><A HREF="#fn_1446"><FONT SIZE="1">1447</FONT></A>
