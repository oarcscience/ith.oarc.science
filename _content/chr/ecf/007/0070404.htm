<p class="BodyText"><a name="viii.ii.ii-p1"></A>In 1875 <a name="viii.ii.ii-p1.1"></A>Bryennios, who had been chosen Metropolitan of Serr&aelig; during his absence at the Old Catholic conference in Bonn, published at Constantinople the two Epistles of <a name="viii.ii.ii-p1.2"></A>Clement, with prolegomena and notes; giving the text found in the Jerusalem Codex, as he termed it. All patristic scholars welcomed his work, which bore every mark of care and learning; showing the results of his contact, as a student, with German methods. Bishop <a name="viii.ii.ii-p1.3"></A>Lightfoot and many others at once made use of this new material. The remaining contents of the Codex were named in the volume of <a name="viii.ii.ii-p1.4"></A>Bryennios, and some interest awakened by the mention of the <a name="viii.ii.ii-p1.5"></A>Teaching. The learned Metropolitan furnished new readings from other parts of the Codex to German scholars. At the close of 1883 he published in Constantinople the text of the <a name="viii.ii.ii-p1.6"></A>Teaching, with prolegomena and notes. A copy of the volume was received in Germany in January, 1884; was translated into German, and published Feb. 3, 1884; translated from German into English, and published in <A NAME="page_373"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 373</FONT></A> <a name="viii.ii.ii-Page_373"></A>America, Feb. 28, 1884; Archdeacon <a name="viii.ii.ii-p1.7"></A>Farrar published (<a name="viii.ii.ii-p1.8"></A>Contemporary Review) a version from the Greek in May, 1884. Before the close of the year the literature on the subject, exclusive of newspaper articles, covered fifty titles (given by <a name="viii.ii.ii-p1.9"></A>Schaff) in Western Europe and America.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2359"></A><A HREF="#fn_2359"><FONT SIZE="1">2360</FONT></A>
