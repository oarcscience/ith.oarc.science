<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iv.i-p1"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iii.ii.iv.i-p1.1"></A>When</span> I reflect, O Emperor <a name="iii.ii.iv.i-p1.2"></A>Constantine, and often revolve in my mind the original condition of men, it is accustomed to appear alike wonderful and unworthy that, by the folly of one age embracing various superstitions, and believing in the existence of many gods, they suddenly arrived at such ignorance of themselves, that the truth being taken away from their eyes, the religion of the true God was not observed, nor the condition of human nature, since men did not seek the chief good in heaven, but on earth. And on this account assuredly the happiness of the ancient ages was changed. For, having left God, the parent and founder of all things, men began to worship the senseless works&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_494"></A><A HREF="#fn_494"><FONT SIZE="1">495</FONT></A>
 of their own hands. And what were the effects of this corruption, or what evils it introduced, the subject itself sufficiently declares. For, turning away from the chief good, which is blessed and everlasting on this account, because it cannot be seen,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_495"></A><A HREF="#fn_495"><FONT SIZE="1">496</FONT></A>
 or touched, or comprehended, and from the virtues which are in agreement with that good, and which are equally immortal, gliding down to these corrupt and frail gods, and devoting themselves to those things by which the body only is adorned, and nourished, and delighted, they sought eternal death for themselves, together with their gods and goods relating to the body, because all bodies are subject to death. Superstitions of this kind, therefore, were followed by injustice and impiety, as must necessarily be the case. For men ceased to raise their countenances to the heaven; but, their minds being depressed downwards, clung to goods of the earth, as they did to earth-born superstitions. There followed the disagreement of mankind, and fraud, and all wickedness; because, despising eternal and incorruptible goods, which alone ought to be desired by man, they rather chose temporal and short-lived things, and greater trust was placed by men in evil, inasmuch as they preferred vice to virtue, because it had presented itself as nearer at hand.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_496"></A><A HREF="#fn_496"><FONT SIZE="1">497</FONT></A>
  &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iv.i-p5"></A>Thus human life, which in former ages had been occupied with the clearest light, was overspread with gloom and darkness; and in conformity with this depravity, when wisdom was taken away, then at length men began to claim for themselves the name of wise. For at the time when all were wise, no one was called by that name. And would that this name, once common to all the class, though reduced to a few, still retained its power! For those few might perhaps be able, either by talent, or by authority, or by continual exhortations, to free the people from vices and errors. But so entirely had wisdom died out, that it is evident, from the very arrogance of the name, that no one of those who were so called was really wise. And yet, before the discovery of this philosophy, as it is termed, there are said to have been seven,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_497"></A><A HREF="#fn_497"><FONT SIZE="1">498</FONT></A>
 who, because they ventured to inquire into and discuss natural subjects, deserved to be esteemed and called wise men. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iv.i-p7"></A>O wretched and calamitous age, in which through the whole world there were only seven who were called by the name of men, for no one can justly be called a man unless he is wise! But if all the others besides themselves were foolish, even they themselves were not wise, because no one can be truly wise in the judgment of the foolish. So far were they removed from wisdom, that not even afterwards, when learning increased, and many and great intellects were always intent upon this very subject, could the <A NAME="page_102"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 102</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.iv.i-Page_102"></A>truth be perceived and ascertained. For, after the renown of those seven wise men, it is incredible with how great a desire of inquiring into the truth all Greece was inflamed. And first of all, they thought&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_498"><FONT SIZE="1">499</FONT></A>
 the very name of wisdom arrogant, and did not call themselves wise men, but desirous of wisdom. By which deed they both condemned those who had rashly arrogated to themselves the name of wise men, of error and folly, and themselves also of ignorance, which indeed they did not deny. For wherever the nature of the subject had, as it were, laid its hands upon their minds, so that they were unable to give any account, they were accustomed to testify that, they knew nothing, and discerned nothing. Wherefore they are found to be much wiser, who in some degree saw themselves, than those who had believed that they were wise. &#160;</p>
