#### <span id="ix.iii.i-p0.1"></span>Sec. I.—On Examining Candidates for the Episcopal Office.

#### <span id="ix.iii.i-p0.2"></span>That a Bishop Must Be Well Instructed and Experienced in the Word.

<span id="ix.iii.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.i-p1.1"></span>I</span>. <span id="ix.iii.i-p1.2"></span>But
concerning bishops, we have heard from our Lord, that a pastor who is to
be ordained a bishop for the churches in every parish, must be
unblameable, unreprovable, free from all kinds of wickedness common
among men, not under fifty years of age; for such a one is in good part
past youthful disorders, and the slanders of the heathen, as well as the
reproaches which are sometimes cast upon many persons by some false
brethren, who do not consider the word of God in the Gospel: “Whosoever
speaketh an idle word shall give an account thereof to the Lord in the
day of judgment.” <span id="fr_2581"></span>[2582](#fn_2581) And again:
“By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be
condemned.” <span id="fr_2582"></span>[2583](#fn_2582) Let him
therefore, <span id="ix.iii.i-p3.2"></span>if it is possible, be well
educated; <span id="ix.iii.i-p3.3"></span>but if he be unlettered, let
him at any rate be <span id="fr_2583"></span>[2584](#fn_2583) skilful in
the word, and of competent age. But if in a small parish one advanced in
years is not to be found, <span id="fr_2584"></span>[2585](#fn_2584) let
some younger person, who has a good report among his neighbours, and is
esteemed by them worthy of the office of a bishop,—who has carried
himself from his youth with meekness and regularity, like a much elder
person,—after examination, and a general good report, be ordained in
peace. For <span id="ix.iii.i-p5.2"></span>Solomon at twelve years of
age was king of Israel, <span id="fr_2585"></span>[2586](#fn_2585) and
<span id="ix.iii.i-p6.2"></span>Josiah at eight years of age reigned
righteously, <span id="fr_2586"></span>[2587](#fn_2586) and in like
manner <span id="ix.iii.i-p7.2"></span>Joash governed the people at
seven years of age. <span id="fr_2587"></span>[2588](#fn_2587)
Wherefore, although the person be young, let him be meek, gentle, and
quiet. For the Lord God says by <span id="ix.iii.i-p8.3"></span>Esaias:
“Upon whom will I look, but upon him who is humble and quiet, and always
trembles at my words?” <span id="fr_2588"></span>[2589](#fn_2588) In
like manner it is in the Gospel also: “Blessed are the meek: for they
shall inherit the earth.” <span id="fr_2589"></span>[2590](#fn_2589) Let
him also be merciful; for again it is said: “Blessed are the merciful:
for they shall obtain mercy.” <span id="fr_2590"></span>[2591](#fn_2590)
<span id="ix.iii.i-p11.2"></span>Let him also be a peacemaker; for again
it is said: “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the
sons of God.” <span id="fr_2591"></span>[2592](#fn_2591) Let him also be
one of a good conscience, purified from all evil, and wickedness, and
unrighteousness; for it is said again: “Blessed are the pure in heart:
for they shall see God.” <span id="fr_2592"></span>[2593](#fn_2592)  

#### <span id="ix.iii.i-p13.2"></span>What Ought to Be the Characters of a Bishop and of the Rest of the Clergy.

<span id="ix.iii.i-p14"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.i-p14.1"></span>II</span>. Let him therefore be sober,
prudent, decent, firm, stable, not given to wine; no striker, but
gentle; not a brawler, not covetous; “not a novice, lest, being puffed
up with pride, he fall into condemnation, and the snare of the devil:
for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased.” <span
id="fr_2593"></span>[2594](#fn_2593) Such a one a bishop ought to be,
who has been the “husband of one wife,” <span
id="fr_2594"></span>[2595](#fn_2594) who also has herself had no other
husband, “ruling well his own house.” <span
id="fr_2595"></span>[2596](#fn_2595) In this manner let examination be
made when he is to receive ordination, and to be placed in his
bishopric, whether he be grave, faithful, decent; whether he hath a
grave and faithful wife, or has formerly had such a one; whether he hath
educated his children piously, and has “brought them up in the nurture
and admonition of the Lord;” <span id="fr_2596"></span>[2597](#fn_2596)
whether his domestics do fear and reverence <span id="page_397">p.
397</span> <span id="ix.iii.i-Page_397"></span>him, and are all obedient
to him: for if those who are immediately about him for worldly concerns
are seditious and disobedient, how will others not of his family, when
they are under his management, become obedient to him?  

#### <span id="ix.iii.i-p18.2"></span>In What Things a Bishop is to Be Examined Before He is Ordained.

<span id="ix.iii.i-p19"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.i-p19.1"></span>III</span>. Let examination also be made
whether he be unblameable as to the concerns of this life; for it is
written: “Search diligently for all the faults of him who is to be
ordained for the priesthood.” <span id="fr_2597"></span>[2598](#fn_2597)
