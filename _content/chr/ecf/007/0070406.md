#### <span id="viii.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>section 4.—authenticity.

<span id="viii.ii.iv-p1"></span>By this is meant, in this case, the
substantial identity of the recently discovered document with the work
known and referred to by early Christian writers under the same (or a
similar) title. Of apostolic origin no one should presume to speak,
since the text of the document makes no such claim, and internal
evidence is obviously against such a suggestion. On the other hand,
there is no reason for doubting the age of the Codex, or the accuracy of
the edition published by <span id="viii.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>Bryennios.  

<span id="viii.ii.iv-p2"></span><span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>Eusebius (<span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.2"></span>d. 340) of Cæsarea, in the famous passage of
his history (iii. 25) which treats of the canonical books of the New
Testament, names among the “spurious” works (<span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.3"></span>νόθοι</span>) “the so-called <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.4"></span>Teachings of the Apostles” (<span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.5"></span>τω</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.6"></span>̑</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.7"></span>ν</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.8"></span>ἀποστο</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.9"></span>́</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.10"></span>λων</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.11"></span>αἱ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.12"></span>λεγο</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.13"></span>́</span><span

class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.15"></span>διδαχαι</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.16"></span>́</span>). The plural
form does <span id="page_374">p. 374</span> <span
id="viii.ii.iv-Page_374"></span>not forbid a reference to the work under
discussion, since <span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.17"></span>Athanasius (<span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.18"></span>d. 373) has a notice clearly pointing to
the same writing, in which he uses the singular (<span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.19"></span>Festal Epistle, 39). <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.20"></span>Rufinus (<span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.21"></span>d. 410) speaks of a brief work called <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.22"></span>The Two Ways, or <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.23"></span>The Judgment of Peter; and this fact, in
view of the contents of the <span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.24"></span>Teaching,
furnishes one of the most important data for the critical discussion.
The last notice of the <span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.25"></span>Teaching was
made by <span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.26"></span>Nicephorus (<span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.27"></span>d. 828) more than two hundred years before
Leon made this copy. <span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.28"></span>Clement of <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.29"></span>Alexandria (<span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.30"></span>d. circa 216) and <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.31"></span>Irenæus (<span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.32"></span>mart. 202) use expressions that may
indicate an acquaintance with this writing. The more extended
correspondences with <span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.33"></span>Barnabas and
later disciplinary works are noticed above (sec. 3). The existence of an
old Latin translation of the <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.34"></span>Teaching, of the tenth century, a fragment
of which has been preserved, furnishes general evidence to the
authenticity of the Greek copy, but by its variations suggests the
presence of many textual corruptions. Its closer correspondence with
<span id="viii.ii.iv-p2.35"></span>Barnabas has led to the theory that
the translator used both documents. Others suppose that its form points
to a document which was the common source of the Greek form of the <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.36"></span>Teaching and of <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p2.37"></span>Barnabas.  

<span id="viii.ii.iv-p3"></span>The various theories based on the above
facts cannot even be stated. The following positions seem, on the whole,
most tenable:—  

<span id="viii.ii.iv-p4"></span>1. The Greek Codex presents
substantially the writing referred to by <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p4.1"></span>Eusebius and <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p4.2"></span>Athanasius.  

<span id="viii.ii.iv-p5"></span>2. Owing to an absence of other copies,
we cannot determine the purity of the text; but there is every
probability of many minor corruptions.  

<span id="viii.ii.iv-p6"></span>3. This probability calls for care that
we do not infer too much from verbal resemblances.  

<span id="viii.ii.iv-p7"></span>4. The resemblances to book vii., <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p7.1"></span>Apostolic Constitutions, are, however, of
such a character as establish, not only a literary connection between
the two works, but also the priority of the <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p7.2"></span>Teaching  

<span id="viii.ii.iv-p8"></span>5. In the case of <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p8.1"></span>Barnabas, the resemblances can be accounted
for (<span id="viii.ii.iv-p8.2"></span>a) by accepting the priority of
the <span id="viii.ii.iv-p8.3"></span>Teaching, or (<span
id="viii.ii.iv-p8.4"></span>b) by assuming a common (earlier and
unknown) source, or (<span id="viii.ii.iv-p8.5"></span>c) by accepting
the priority of <span id="viii.ii.iv-p8.6"></span>Barnabas, and assuming
such corruptions in the Greek copy of the <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p8.7"></span>Teaching as will account for the supposed
marks of its priority. Despite the general adoption of (<span
id="viii.ii.iv-p8.8"></span>a), there remains a strong probability that
(<span id="viii.ii.iv-p8.9"></span>b) is the correct solution of the
problem.  

<span id="viii.ii.iv-p9"></span>6. The <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p9.1"></span>Duæ Viæ, spoken of by <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p9.2"></span>Rufinus, may be the common source. We have
no positive evidence, but the “two ways” form so prominent a topic in
most of these documents which indicate literary relationship, as to
encourage this theory. If there was a common source, it probably
contained only matter similar to chaps. i.-v., which was variously used
by the subsequent compilers. Here a number of theories have been
suggested. <span id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361) None of them,
however, necessarily call for a very late date of the <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p10.5"></span>Teaching, or compel us to deny that <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p10.6"></span>Eusebius and <span
id="viii.ii.iv-p10.7"></span>Athanasius referred to substantially the
same work as that now existing in the Codex at Constantinople. Many
resemblances have been noticed in other works. Probably in the course of
a few years all the data will have been collected, and a well-defined
result based upon them. But, even in this period of discussion, there is
remarkable agreement among critics in regard to the main question of
authenticity.
