<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p1"></A><a name="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p1.1"></A>Faunas was the first in Latium who introduced these follies, who both instituted bloody sacrifices to his grandfather <a name="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p1.2"></A>Saturnus, and wished that his father <a name="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p1.3"></A>Picus should be worshipped as a god, and placed <a name="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p1.4"></A>Fatua Fauna his wife and sister among the gods, and named her the good goddess. Then at Rome, <a name="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p1.5"></A>Numa, who burthened those rude and rustic then with new superstitions, instituted priesthoods, and distributed the gods into families and nations, that he might call off the fierce spirits of the people from the pursuits of arms.
