<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xiii-p1"></A>You see, then, that the poets did not invent all things, and that they prefigured some things, that, when they spoke the truth, they might add something like this of divinity to those whom they called gods; as they did also respecting their kingdoms. For when they say that <a name="iii.ii.viii.xiii-p1.1"></A>Jupiter had by lot the kingdom of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xiii-p1.2"></A>C&#339;lus, they either menu Mount Olympus, on which ancient stories relate that <a name="iii.ii.viii.xiii-p1.3"></A>Saturnus, and afterwards <a name="iii.ii.viii.xiii-p1.4"></A>Jupiter, dwelt, or a part of the East, which is, as it were, higher, because the light arises thence; but the region of the West is lower, and therefore they say that <a name="iii.ii.viii.xiii-p1.5"></A>Pluto obtained the lower regions; but that the sea was given to <a name="iii.ii.viii.xiii-p1.6"></A>Neptune, because he <A NAME="page_228"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 228</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.viii.xiii-Page_228"></A>had the maritime coast, with all the islands. Many things are thus coloured by the poets; and they who are ignorant of this, censure them as false, but only in word: for in fact they believe them, since they so fashion the images of the gods, that when they make them male and female, and confess that some are married, some parents, and some children, they plainly assent to the poets; for these relations cannot exist without intercourse and the generation of children. &#160;</p>
