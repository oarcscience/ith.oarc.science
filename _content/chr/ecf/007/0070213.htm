<p> <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxi"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xxi-p0.1"></A>Chap. XXV.&#8212;Of the Golden Age, of Images, and Prometheus, Who First Fashioned Man.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xxi-p1"></A>The poets, therefore, with good reason say that the golden age, which existed in the reign of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxi-p1.1"></A>Saturnus, was changed. For at that time no gods were worshipped, but they knew of one God only. After that they subjected themselves to frail and earthly things, worshipping idols of wood, and brass, and stone, a change took place from the golden age to that of iron. For having lost the knowledge of God, and broken off that one bond of human society, they began to harass one another, to plunder and subdue. But if they would raise their eyes aloft and behold God, who raised them up to the sight of heaven and Himself, they never would bend and prostrate themselves by worshipping earthly things, whose folly <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxi-p1.2"></A>Lucretius severely rebukes, saying:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1474"></A><A HREF="#fn_1474"><FONT SIZE="1">1475</FONT></A>
  &#160;</p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.viii.xxi-p2.2"></A>   &#8220;And they abase their souls with fear of the gods, and weigh and press them down to the earth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1475"></A><A HREF="#fn_1475"><FONT SIZE="1">1476</FONT></A>
 <br>  </blockquote>  
<p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xxi-p4"></A>Wherefore they tremble, and do not understand how foolish it is to fear those things which you have made, or to hope for any protection from those things which are dumb and insensible, and neither see nor hear the suppliant. What majesty, therefore, or deity can they have, which were in the power of a man, that they should not be made, or that they should be made into some other thing, and are so even now? For they are liable to injury and might be carried off by theft, were it not that they are protected by the law and the guardianship of man. Does he therefore appear to be in possession of his senses, who sacrifices to such deities the choicest victims, consecrates gifts, offers costly garments, as if they who are without motion could use them? With reason, then, did <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxi-p4.1"></A>Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily plunder and deride the gods of Greece when he had taken possession of it as conqueror; and after the sacrilegious acts which he had committed, he returned to Sicily with a prosperous voyage, and held the kingdom even to his old age: nor were the injured gods able to punish him. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xxi-p5"></A>How much better is it to despise vanities, and to turn to God, to maintain the condition which you have received from God, to maintain your name! For on this account he is called <span><a name="iii.ii.viii.xxi-p5.1"></A>anthropos</span>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1476"></A><A HREF="#fn_1476"><FONT SIZE="1">1477</FONT></A>
 because he looks upward. But he looks upward who looks up to the true and living God, who is in heaven; who seeks after the Maker and Parent of his soul, not only with his perception and mind, but also with his countenance and eyes raised aloft. But he who enslaves himself to earthly and humble things, plainly prefers to himself that which is below him. For since he himself is the workmanship of God, whereas an image is the workmanship of man, the human workmanship cannot be preferred to the divine; and as God is the parent of man, so is the man of the statue. Therefore he is foolish and senseless who adores that which he himself has made, of which detestable and foolish handicraft <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxi-p6.10"></A>Prometheus was the author, who was born from <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxi-p6.11"></A>Iapetus the uncle of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxi-p6.12"></A>Jupiter. For when first of all <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxi-p6.13"></A>Jupiter, having obtained supreme dominion, wished to establish himself as a god, and to found temples, and was seeking for some one who was able to imitate the human figure, at that time <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxi-p6.14"></A>Prometheus lived, who fashioned the image of a man from thick clay with such close resemblance, that the novelty and cleverness of the art was a wonder. At length the men of his own time, and afterwards the poets, handed him down as the maker of a true and living man; and we, as often as we praise wrought statues, say that they live and breathe. And he indeed was the inventor of earthenware images. But posterity, following him, both carved them out of marble, and moulded them <A NAME="page_231"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 231</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxi-Page_231"></A>out of bronze; then in process of time ornament was added of gold and ivory, so that not only the likenesses, but also the gleam itself, might dazzle the eyes. Thus ensnared by beauty, and forgetful of true majesty, sensible beings considered that insensible objects, rational beings that irrational objects, living beings that lifeless objects, were to be worshipped and reverenced by them. &#160;</p>
