#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXIII.—Of Giving Precepts, and Acting.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxiii-p1"></span>If any one gives to men precepts
for living, and moulds the characters of others, I ask whether he is
bound himself to practice the things which he enjoins, or is not bound.
If he shall not do so, his precepts are annulled. For if the things
which are enjoined are good, if they place the life of men in the best
condition, the instructor ought not to separate himself from the number
and assemblage of men among whom he acts; and he ought himself to live
in the same manner in which he teaches that men ought to live, lest, by
living in another way, he himself should disparage <span
id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807) his own precepts, and make his
instruction of less value, if in reality he should relax the obligations
of that which he endeavours to establish by his words. For every one,
when he hears another giving precepts, is unwilling that the necessity
of obeying should be imposed upon him, as though the right of liberty
were taken from him. Therefore he answers his teacher in this manner: I
am not able to do the things which you command, for they are impossible.
For you forbid me to be angry, you forbid me to covet, you forbid me to
be excited by desire, you forbid me to fear pain or death; but this is
so contrary to nature, that all animals are subject to these affections.
Or if you are so entirely of opinion that it is possible to resist
nature, do you yourself practice the things which you enjoin, that I may
know that they are possible? But since you yourself do not practice
them, what arrogance is it, to wish to impose upon a free man laws which
you yourself do not obey! You who teach, first learn; and before you
correct the character of others, correct your own. Who could deny the
justice of this answer? Nay! a teacher of this kind will fall into
contempt, and will in his turn be mocked, because he also will appear to
mock others.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxiii-p3"></span>What, therefore, will that
instructor do, if these things shall be objected to him? how will he
deprive the self-willed <span id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808) of an
excuse, unless he teach them by deeds before their eyes <span
id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809) that he teaches things which are
possible? Whence it comes to pass, that no one obeys the precepts of the
philosophers. <span id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810) For men prefer
examples rather than words, because it is easy to speak, but difficult
to accomplish. <span id="fr_811"></span>[812](#fn_811) Would to heaven
that there were as many who acted well as there are who speak well! But
they who give precepts, <span id="page_125">p. 125</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxiii-Page_125"></span>without carrying them out into
action, are distrusted; <span id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812) and if
they shall be men, will be despised as inconsistent: <span
id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813) if it shall be God, He will be met
with the excuse of the frailty of man’s nature. It remains that words
should be confirmed by deeds, which the philosophers are unable to do.
Therefore, since the instructors themselves are overcome by the
affections which they say that it is our duty to overcome, they are able
to train no one to virtue, which they falsely proclaim; <span
id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814) and for this cause they imagine that
no perfect wise man has as yet existed, that is, in whom the greatest
virtue and perfect justice were in harmony with the greatest learning
and knowledge. And this indeed was true. For no one since the creation
of the world has been such, except Christ, who both delivered wisdom by
His word, and confirmed His teaching by presenting virtue to the eyes of
men. <span id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815)
