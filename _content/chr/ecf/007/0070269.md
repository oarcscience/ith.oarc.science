#### <span id="iii.iii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chap. VI.—That God is Angry.

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p1"></span>These are the opinions entertained by
the philosophers respecting God. But if we have discovered that these
things which have been spoken are false, there remains that one last
resource, in which alone the truth can be found, which has never been
embraced by philosophers, nor at any time defended: that it follows that
God is angry, since He is moved by kindness. This opinion is to be
maintained and asserted by us; for <span
id="fr_1650"></span>[1651](#fn_1650) this is the sum and turning-point
on which the whole of piety and religion depend: and no honour can be
due to God, if He affords nothing to His worshippers; and no fear, if He
is not angry with him who does not worship Him. <span

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p3"></span> \[This fear of the Lord is <span
id="iii.iii.vi-p3.1"></span>filial, not <span
id="iii.iii.vi-p3.2"></span>servile; and this anger is likewise twofold,
including fatherly and corrective indignation, and the wrath of the
magistrate, which inflicts penalty and retribution. Compare [Ps. vii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#011)<span id="iii.iii.vi-p3.3"></span>;
also p. 104, note 1, <span id="iii.iii.vi-p3.5"></span>supra.\]
