<p> <a name="iii.ii.viii.lxiii"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.viii.lxiii-p0.1"></A>Chap. LXVII.&#8212;Of Repentance, the Immortality of the Soul, and of Providence.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.lxiii-p1"></A>But it is true all these things are difficult to man, nor does the condition of his frailty permit that any one should be without blemish. Therefore the last remedy is this, that we have recourse to repentance, which has not the least place among the virtues, because it is a correction of oneself; that when we have happened to fail either in deed or in word, we may immediately come to a better mind, and confess that we have offended, and entreat pardon from God, which according to His mercy He will not deny, except to those who persist in their error. Great is the aid, great the solace of repentance. That is the healing of wounds and offences, that hope, that the harbour of safety; and he who takes away this cuts off from himself the way of salvation, because no one can be so just that repentance is never necessary for him. But we, even though there is no offence of ours, yet ought to confess to God, and to entreat pardon for our faults, and to give thanks even in evils. Let us always offer this obedience to our Lord. For humility is dear and lovely in the sight of God; for since He rather receives the sinner who confesses his fault, than the just man who is haughty, how much more will He receive the just man who confesses, and exalt him in His heavenly kingdom in proportion to his humility! These are the things which the worshipper of God ought to hold forth; these are the victims, this the sacrifice, which is acceptable; this is true worship, when a man offers upon the altar of God the pledges of his own mind. That supreme Majesty rejoices in such a worshipper as this, as it takes him as a son and bestows upon him the befitting reward of immortality, concerning which I must now speak, and refute the persuasion of those who think that the soul is destroyed together with the body. For inasmuch as they neither knew God nor were able to perceive the mystery of the world, they did not even comprehend the nature of man and of the soul. For how could they see the consequences, who did not hold the main point?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1590"></A><A HREF="#fn_1590"><FONT SIZE="1">1591</FONT></A>
 Therefore, in denying the existence of a providence, they plainly denied the existence of God, who is the fountain and source of all things. It followed that they should either affirm that those things which exist have always existed, or were produced of their own accord, or arose from a meeting together of minute seeds. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.lxiii-p3"></A>It cannot be said that that which exists, and is visible, always existed; for it cannot exist of itself without some beginning. But nothing can be produced of its own accord, because there is no nature without one who generates it. But how could there be original&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1591"></A><A HREF="#fn_1591"><FONT SIZE="1">1592</FONT></A>
 seeds, since both the seeds arise from objects,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1592"></A><A HREF="#fn_1592"><FONT SIZE="1">1593</FONT></A>
 and, in their turn, objects from seeds? Therefore there is no seed which has not origin. Thus it came to pass, that when they supposed that the world was produced by no providence, they did not suppose that even man was produced by any plan.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1593"></A><A HREF="#fn_1593"><FONT SIZE="1">1594</FONT></A>
 But if no plan was made use of in the creation of man, therefore the soul cannot be immortal. But others, on the other hand, thought there was but one God, and that the world was made by Him, and made for the sake of men, and that souls are immortal. But though they entertained true sentiments, nevertheless they did not perceive the causes, or reasons, or issues of this divine work and design, so as to complete the whole mystery of the truth, and to comprise it within some limit. But that which they were not able to do, because they did not hold the truth in its integrity,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1594"></A><A HREF="#fn_1594"><FONT SIZE="1">1595</FONT></A>
 must be done by us, who know it on the announcement of God. &#160;</p>
