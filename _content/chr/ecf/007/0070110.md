#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXVIII.—Of Hope and True Religion, and of Superstition.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxviii-p1"></span>And since these things are so, as
we have shown, it is plain that no other hope of life is set before man,
except that, laying aside vanities and wretched error, he should know
God, <span id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870) and serve God; except he
renounce this temporary life, and train himself by the principles of
righteousness for the cultivation of true religion. For we are created
on this condition, that we pay just and due obedience to God who created
us, that we should know and follow Him alone. We are <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxviii-p2.3"></span>bound and <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxviii-p2.4"></span>tied to God by this <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxviii-p2.5"></span>chain of piety; <span
id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871) from which religion itself received
its name, not, as <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxviii-p3.5"></span>Cicero
explained it, from carefully gathering, <span
id="fr_872"></span>[873](#fn_872) for in his second book respecting the
nature of the gods he thus speaks: “For not only philosophers, but our
ancestors also, separated superstition from religion. For they who spent
whole days in prayers and sacrifices, that their children might
survive <span id="fr_873"></span>[874](#fn_873) them, were called
superstitious. But they who handled again, and as it were carefully
gathered all things which related to the worship of the gods, were
called religious from carefully gathering, <span
id="fr_874"></span>[875](#fn_874) as some were called elegant from
choosing out, and diligent from carefully selecting and intelligent from
understanding. For in all these words there is the same meaning of
gathering which there is in the word religious: thus it has come to
pass, that in the names superstitious and religious, the one relates to
a fault, the other belongs to praise.” How senseless this interpretation
is, we may know from the matter itself. For if both religion and
superstition are engaged in the worship of the same gods, there is
little or rather no difference between them. For what cause will he
allege why he should think that to pray once for the health of sons is
the part of a religious man, but to do the same ten times is the part of
a superstitious man? For if it is an excellent thing to pray once, how
much more so to do it more frequently! If it is well to do it at the
first hour, then it is well to do it throughout the day. If one victim
renders the deity propitious, it is plain that many victims must render
him more propitious, because multiplied services oblige <span
id="fr_875"></span>[876](#fn_875) rather than offend. For those servants
do not appear to us hateful who are assiduous and constant in their
attendance, but more beloved. Why, therefore, should he be in fault, and
receive a name which implies censure, <span
id="fr_876"></span>[877](#fn_876) who either loves his children more, or
sufficiently honours the gods; and he, on the contrary, be praised, who
loves them less? And this argument has weight also from the contrary.
For if it is wrong <span id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877) to pray and
sacrifice during whole days, therefore it is wrong to do so once. If it
is faulty frequently to wish for the preservation of our children,
therefore he also is superstitious who conceives that wish even rarely.
Or why should the name of a fault be derived from that, than which
nothing can be wished more honourable, nothing more just? For as to his
saying, that they who diligently take in hand again the things relating
to the worship of the gods are called religious from their carefully
gathering; how is it, then, that they who do this often in a day lose
the name of religious men, when it is plain from their very assiduity
that they more diligently gather those things by which the gods are
worshipped?  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxviii-p10"></span>What, then, is it? Truly religion
is the cultivation of the truth, but superstition of that which is
false. And it makes the entire difference what you worship, not how you
worship, or what prayer you offer. <span
id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878) But because the worshippers of the
gods imagine themselves to be religious, though they are superstitious,
they are neither able to distinguish religion from superstition, nor to
express the meaning of the names. We have said that the name of religion
is derived from <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxviii-p11.5"></span>the bond of
piety, <span id="fr_879"></span>[880](#fn_879) because God has <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxviii-p12.3"></span>tied man to Himself, and <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxviii-p12.4"></span>bound him by piety; <span
id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880) for we must serve Him as a master, and
be obedient to Him as a father. And therefore <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxviii-p13.12"></span>Lucretius <span
id="fr_881"></span>[882](#fn_881) <span id="page_132">p. 132</span>
<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxviii-Page_132"></span>better explained this name,
who says that He loosens the knots of superstitions. <span
id="fr_882"></span>[883](#fn_882) But they are called superstitious, not
who wish their children to survive them, for we all wish this; but
either those who reverence the surviving memory of the dead, or those
who, surviving their parents, reverenced their images at their houses as
household gods. For those who assumed to themselves new rites, that they
might honour the dead as gods, whom they supposed to be taken from men
and received into heaven, they called superstitious. But those who
worshipped the public and ancient gods <span
id="fr_883"></span>[884](#fn_883) they named religious. From which <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxviii-p16.1"></span>Virgil says: <span
id="fr_884"></span>[885](#fn_884) —  

> <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxviii-p17.3"></span> “Superstition vain, and
> ignorant of ancient gods.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxviii-p18"></span>But since we find that the
ancient gods also were consecrated in the same manner after their death,
therefore they are superstitious who worship many and false gods. We, on
the other hand, are religious, who make our supplications to the one
true God.
