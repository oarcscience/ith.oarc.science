<span id="iii.ii.vi.viii"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.vi.viii-p0.1"></span>Chap. VIII.—Of the Errors of Philosophers, and the Variableness of Law.

<span id="iii.ii.vi.viii-p1"></span>This is the way which philosophers
seek, but do not find on this account, because they prefer to seek it on
the earth, where it cannot appear. Therefore they wander, as it were, on
the great sea, and do not understand whither they are borne, because
they neither discern the way nor follow any guide. For this way of life
ought to be sought in the same manner in which their course is sought by
ships over the deep: for unless they observe some light of heaven, they
wander with uncertain courses. But whoever strives to hold the right
course of life ought not to look to the earth, but to the heaven: and,
to speak more plainly, he ought not to follow man, but God; not to serve
these earthly images, but the heavenly God; not to measure all things by
their reference to the body, but by their reference to the soul; not to
attend to this life, but the eternal life. Therefore, if you always
direct your eyes towards heaven, and observe the sun, where it rises,
and take this as the guide of your life, as in the case of a voyage,
your feet will spontaneously be directed into the way; and that heavenly
light, which is a much brighter sun <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[1136](#fn_1135) to sound minds than this which we
behold in mortal flesh, will so rule and govern you as to lead you
without any error to the most excellent harbour of wisdom and virtue.  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.viii-p3"></span>Therefore the law of God must be
undertaken, which may direct us to this path; that sacred, that heavenly
law, which <span id="iii.ii.vi.viii-p3.1"></span>Marcus Tullius, in his
third book respecting the Republic, <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[1137](#fn_1136) has described almost with a divine
voice; whose words have subjoined, that I might not speak at greater
length: “There is indeed a true law, right reason, agreeing with nature,
diffused among all, unchanging, everlasting, which calls to duty by
commanding, deters from wrong by forbidding; which, however, neither
commands nor forbids the good in vain, nor affects the wicked by
commanding or forbidding. It is not allowable <span id="page_171">p.
171</span> <span id="iii.ii.vi.viii-Page_171"></span>to alter <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137) the provisions of this law, nor is
it permitted us to modify it, nor can it be entirely abrogated. <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[1139](#fn_1138) Nor, truly, can we be released from
this law, either by the senate or by the people; nor is another person
to be sought to explain or interpret it. Nor will there be one law at
Rome and another at Athens; one law at the present time, and another
hereafter: but the same law, everlasting and unchangeable, will bind all
nations at all times; and there will be one common Master and Ruler of
all, even God, the framer, arbitrator, and proposer of this law; and he
who shall not obey this will flee from himself, and, despising the
nature of man, will suffer the greatest punishments through this very
thing, even though he shall have escaped the other punishments which are
supposed to exist.” Who that is acquainted with the mystery of God could
so significantly relate the law of God, as a man far removed from the
knowledge of the truth has set forth that law? But I consider that they
who speak true things unconsciously are to be so regarded as though they
prophesied <span id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139) under the
influence of some spirit. But if he had known or explained this also, in
what precepts the law itself consisted, as he clearly saw the force and
purport of the divine law, he would not have discharged the office of a
philosopher, but of a prophet. And because he was unable to do this, it
must be done by us, to whom the law itself has been delivered by the one
great Master and Ruler of all, God.
