#### <span id="iii.ii.vii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XVII.—Of the False Prophet, and the Hardships of the Righteous, and His Destruction.

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xvii-p1"></span>But I will more plainly set forth
the manner in which this happens. When the close of the times draws
nigh, a great prophet shall be sent from God to turn men to the
knowledge of God, and he shall receive the power of doing wonderful
things. <span id="fr_1400"></span>[1401](#fn_1400) Wherever men shall
not hear him, he will shut up the heaven, and cause it to withhold its
rains; he will turn their water into blood, and torment them with thirst
and hunger; and if any one shall endeavour to injure him, fire shall
come forth out of his mouth, and shall burn that man. By these prodigies
and powers he shall turn many to the worship of God; and when his works
shall be accomplished, another king shall arise out of Syria, born from
an evil spirit, the overthrower and destroyer of the human race, who
shall destroy that which is left by the former evil, together with
himself. He shall fight against the prophet of God, and shall overcome,
and slay him, and shall suffer him to lie unburied; but after the third
day he shall come to life again; and while all look on and wonder, he
shall be caught up into heaven. But that king will not only be most
disgraceful in himself, but he will also be a prophet of lies; and he
will constitute and call himself God, and will order himself to be
worshipped as the Son of God; and power will be given him to do signs
and wonders, by the sight of which he may entice men to adore him. He
will command fire to come down from heaven, and the sun to stand and
leave his course, and an image to speak; and these things shall be done
at his word,—by which miracles <span
id="fr_1401"></span>[1402](#fn_1401) many even of the wise shall be
enticed by him. Then he will attempt to destroy the temple of God, and
persecute the righteous people; and there will be distress and
tribulation, <span id="fr_1402"></span>[1403](#fn_1402) such as there
never has been from the beginning of the world.  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xvii-p5"></span>As many as shall believe him and
unite themselves to him, shall be marked by him as sheep; but they who
shall refuse his mark will either flee to the mountains, or, being
seized, will be slain with studied <span
id="fr_1403"></span>[1404](#fn_1403) tortures. He will also enwrap
righteous men with the books of the prophets, and thus burn them; and
power will be given him to desolate <span
id="fr_1404"></span>[1405](#fn_1404) the whole earth for forty-two
months. That will be the time in which righteousness shall be cast out,
and innocence be hated; in which the wicked shall prey upon the good as
enemies; neither law, nor order, nor military discipline shall be
preserved; no one shall reverence hoary locks, nor recognise the duty of
piety, nor pity sex or infancy; all things shall be confounded and mixed
together against right, and against the laws of nature. Thus the earth
shall be laid waste, as though by one common robbery. When these things
shall so happen, then the righteous and the followers of truth shall
separate themselves from the wicked, and flee into solitudes. And when
he hears of this, the impious king, inflamed with anger, will come with
a great army, and bringing up all his forces, will surround all the
mountain in which the righteous shall be situated, that he may seize
them. But they, when they shall see themselves <span id="page_215">p.
215</span> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xvii-Page_215"></span>to be shut in on
all sides and besieged, will call upon God with a loud voice, and
implore the aid of heaven; and God shall hear them, and send from heaven
a great king to rescue and free them, and destroy all the wicked with
fire and sword.
