<p> <a name="iii.ii.vi.iii"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vi.iii-p0.1"></A>Chap. III.&#8212;Of the Ways, and of Vices and Virtues; And of the Rewards of Heaven and the Punishments of Hell.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.iii-p1"></A>There are two ways,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1090"></A><A HREF="#fn_1090"><FONT SIZE="1">1091</FONT></A>
 O Emperor <a name="iii.ii.vi.iii-p2.2"></A>Constantine, by which human life must proceed&#8212;the one which leads to heaven, the other which sinks to hell; and these <span><a name="iii.ii.vi.iii-p2.3"></A>ways</span> poets have introduced in their poems, and philosophers in their disputations. And indeed philosophers have represented the one as belonging to virtues, the other to vices; and they have represented that which belongs to virtues as steep and rugged at the first entrance, in which if any one, having overcome the difficulty, has climbed to the summit, they say that he afterwards has a level path, a bright and pleasant plain, and that he enjoys abundant and delightful fruits of his labours; but that those whom the difficulty of the first approach has deterred, glide and turn aside into the way of vices, which at its first entrance appears to be pleasant and much more beaten, but afterwards, when they have advanced in it a little further, that the appearance of its pleasantness is withdrawn, and that there arises a steep way, now rough with stones, now overspread with thorns, now interrupted by deep waters or violent with torrents, so that they must be in difficulty, hesitate, slip about, and fall. And all these things are brought forward that it may appear that there are very great labours in undertaking virtues, but that when they are gained there are the greatest advantages, and firm and incorruptible pleasures; but that vices ensnare the minds of men with certain natural blandishments, and lead them captivated by the appearance of empty pleasures to bitter griefs and miseries,&#8212;an altogether wise discussion, if they knew the forms and limits of the virtues themselves. For they had not learned either what they are, or what reward awaits them from God: but this we will show in these two books. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.iii-p3"></A>But these men, because they were ignorant or in doubt that the souls of men are immortal, estimated both virtues and vices by earthly honours or punishments. Therefore all this discussion respecting the two ways&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1091"></A><A HREF="#fn_1091"><FONT SIZE="1">1092</FONT></A>
 has reference to frugality and luxury. For they say that the course of human life resembles the letter Y, because every one of men, when he has reached the threshold of early youth, and has arrived at the place &#8220;where the way divides itself into two parts,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1092"></A><A HREF="#fn_1092"><FONT SIZE="1">1093</FONT></A>
 is in doubt, and hesitates, and does not know to which side he should rather turn himself. If he shall meet with a guide who may direct him wavering to better things&#8212;that is, if he shall learn philosophy or eloquence, or some honourable arts by which he may turn to good conduct,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1093"></A><A HREF="#fn_1093"><FONT SIZE="1">1094</FONT></A>
 which cannot take place without great labour&#8212;they say that he will lead a life of honour and abundance; but if he shall not meet with a teacher of temperance,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1094"></A><A HREF="#fn_1094"><FONT SIZE="1">1095</FONT></A>
 that he falls into the way on the left hand, which assumes the appearance of the better,&#8212;that is, he gives himself up to idleness, sloth, and luxury, which seem pleasant for a time to one who is ignorant of true goods, but that afterwards, having lost all his dignity and property, he will live in all wretchedness and ignominy. Therefore they referred the end of those ways&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1095"></A><A HREF="#fn_1095"><FONT SIZE="1">1096</FONT></A>
 to the body, and to this life which we lead on earth. The poets perhaps did better, who would have it that this twofold way was in the lower regions; but they are deceived in this, that they proposed these ways to the dead. Both therefore spoke with truth, but yet both incorrectly; for the ways themselves ought to have been referred to life, their ends to death. We therefore speak better and more truly, who say that the two ways&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1096"></A><A HREF="#fn_1096"><FONT SIZE="1">1097</FONT></A>
 belong to heaven and hell, because immortality is promised to the righteous, and everlasting punishment is threatened to the unrighteous. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.iii-p10"></A>But I will explain how these ways either exalt to heaven or thrust down to hell, and I will set forth what these virtues are of which the philosophers were ignorant; then I will show what are their rewards, and also what are vices, and what their punishments. For perhaps some one may expect that I shall speak separately of vices and virtues; whereas, when we discuss the subject of good or evil, that which is contrary may also <A NAME="page_165"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 165</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.vi.iii-Page_165"></A>be understood. For, whether you introduce virtues, vices will spontaneously depart; or if you take away vices, virtues will of their own accord succeed. The nature of good and evil things is so fixed, that they always oppose and drive out one another: and thus it comes to pass that vices cannot be removed without virtues, nor can virtues be introduced without the removal of vices. Therefore we bring forward these ways in a very different manner from that in which the philosophers are accustomed to present them: first of all, because we say that a guide is proposed to each, and in each case an immortal: but that the one is honoured who presides over virtues and good qualities, the other condemned who presides over vices and evils. But they place a guide only on the right side, and that not one only, nor a lasting one; inasmuch as they introduce any teacher of a good art, who may recall men from sloth, and teach them to be temperate. But they do not represent any as entering upon that way except boys and young men; for this reason, that the arts are learned at these ages. We, on the other hand, lead those of each sex, every age and race, into this heavenly path, because God, who is the guide of that way, denies immortality to no human being.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1097"></A><A HREF="#fn_1097"><FONT SIZE="1">1098</FONT></A>
 The shape also of the ways themselves is not as they supposed. For what need is there of the letter Y in matters which are different and opposed to one another? But the one which is better is turned towards the rising of the sun, the other which is worse towards its setting: since he who follows truth and righteousness, having received the reward of immortality, will enjoy perpetual light; but he who, enticed by that evil guide, shall prefer vices to virtues, falsehood to truth, must be borne to the setting of the sun, and to darkness.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1098"></A><A HREF="#fn_1098"><FONT SIZE="1">1099</FONT></A>
 I will therefore describe each, and will point out their properties and habits. &#160;</p>
