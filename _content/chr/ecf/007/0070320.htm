<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xi-p1"></A>The mother of <a name="iii.v.xi-p1.1"></A>Galerius, a woman exceedingly superstitious, was a votary of the gods of the mountains. Being of such a character, she made sacrifices almost every day, and she feasted her servants on the meat offered to idols: but the Christians of her family would not partake of those entertainments; and while she feasted with the Gentiles, they continued in fasting and prayer. On this account she conceived ill-will against the Christians, and by woman-like complaints instigated her son, no less superstitious than herself, to destroy them. So, during the whole winter, <a name="iii.v.xi-p1.2"></A>Diocletian and <a name="iii.v.xi-p1.3"></A>Galerius held councils together, at which no one else assisted; and it was the universal opinion that their conferences respected the most momentous affairs of the empire. The old man long opposed the fury of <a name="iii.v.xi-p1.4"></A>Galerius, and showed how pernicious it would be to raise disturbances throughout the world and to shed so much blood; that the Christians were wont with eagerness to meet death; and that it would be enough for him to exclude persons of that religion from the court&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1970"></A><A HREF="#fn_1970"><FONT SIZE="1">1971</FONT></A>
 and the army. Yet he could not restrain the madness of that obstinate man. He resolved, therefore, to take the opinion of his friends. Now this was a circumstance in the bad disposition of <a name="iii.v.xi-p2.4"></A>Diocletian, that whenever he determined to do good, he did it without advice, that the praise might be all his own; but whenever he determined to do ill, which he was sensible would be blamed, he called in many advisers, that his own fault might be imputed to other men: and therefore a few civil magistrates, and a few military commanders, were admitted to give their counsel; and the question was put to them according to priority of rank. Some, through personal ill-will towards the Christians, were of opinion that they ought to be cut off, as enemies of the gods and adversaries of the established religious ceremonies. Others thought differently, but, having understood the will of <a name="iii.v.xi-p2.5"></A>Galerius, they, either from dread of displeasing or from a desire of gratifying him, concurred in the opinion given against the Christians. Yet not even then could the emperor be prevailed upon to yield his assent. He determined above all to consult his gods; and to that end he despatched a soothsayer to inquire of <a name="iii.v.xi-p2.6"></A>Apollo at Miletus, whose answer was such as might be expected from an enemy of the divine religion. So <a name="iii.v.xi-p2.7"></A>Diocletian was drawn over from his purpose. But although he could struggle no longer against his friends, and against C&aelig;sar and <a name="iii.v.xi-p2.8"></A>Apollo, yet still he attempted to observe such moderation as to command the business to be carried through without bloodshed; whereas <a name="iii.v.xi-p2.9"></A>Galerius would have had all persons burnt alive who refused to sacrifice. &#160;</p>
