#### <span id="iii.ii.vii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chap. VIII.—Of the Immortality of the Soul.

<span id="iii.ii.vii.viii-p1"></span>The one chief good, therefore, is
immortality, for the reception of which we were originally formed and
born. To this we direct our course; human nature regards this; to this
virtue exalts us. And because we have discovered this good, it remains
that we should also speak of immortality <span id="page_205">p.
205</span> <span id="iii.ii.vii.viii-Page_205"></span>itself. The
arguments of <span id="iii.ii.vii.viii-p1.1"></span>Plato, although they
contribute much to the subject, have little strength to prove and fill
up the truth, since he had neither summed up and collected into one the
plan of the whole of this great mystery, nor had he comprehended the
chief good. For although he perceived the truth respecting the
immortality of the soul, yet he did not speak respecting it as though it
were the chief good. We, therefore, are able to elicit the truth by more
certain signs; for we have not collected it by doubtful surmise, <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350) but have known it by divine
instruction. Now <span id="iii.ii.vii.viii-p2.2"></span>Plato thus
reasoned, that whatever has perception by itself, and always moves, is
immortal; for that that which has no beginning of motion is not about to
have an end, because it cannot be deserted by itself. But this argument
would give eternal existence even to dumb animals, unless he had made a
distinction by the addition of wisdom. He added, therefore, that he
might escape this common <span id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351)
linking together, that the soul of man could not be otherwise than
immortal, since its wonderful skill in invention, its quickness in
reflection, and its readiness in perceiving and learning, its memory of
the past, and its foresight of the future, and its knowledge of
innumerable arts and subjects, which other living creatures do not
possess, appear divine and heavenly; because of the soul, which
conceives such great things, and contains such great things, no origin
can be found on earth, since it has nothing of earthly admixture united
with it. But that which is ponderous in man, and liable to dissolution,
must be resolved into earth; whereas that which is slight and subtle is
incapable of division, and when freed from the abode of the body, as
from prison, it flies to the heaven, and to its own nature. This is a
brief summary of the tenets of <span
id="iii.ii.vii.viii-p3.2"></span>Plato, which are widely and copiously
explained in his own writings.  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.viii-p4"></span><span
id="iii.ii.vii.viii-p4.1"></span>Pythagoras also was previously of the
same sentiments, and his teacher <span
id="iii.ii.vii.viii-p4.2"></span>Pherecydes, whom <span
id="iii.ii.vii.viii-p4.3"></span>Cicero reported to have been the first
who discoursed respecting the immortality of the soul. And although all
these excelled in eloquence, nevertheless in this contest at least,
those who argued against this opinion had no less authority; <span
id="iii.ii.vii.viii-p4.4"></span>Dicæarchus first, then <span
id="iii.ii.vii.viii-p4.5"></span>Democritus, and lastly <span
id="iii.ii.vii.viii-p4.6"></span>Epicurus: so that the matter itself,
respecting which they were contending, was called into doubt. Finally,
<span id="iii.ii.vii.viii-p4.7"></span>Tullius also having set forth the
opinions of all these respecting immortality and death, declared that he
did not know what was the truth. “Which of these opinions is true,” he
said, “some God may see.” <span id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352) And
again he says in another place: “Since each of these opinions had most
learned defenders, it cannot be divined what is certainty.” But we have
no need of divination, since the divinity itself has laid open to us the
truth.
