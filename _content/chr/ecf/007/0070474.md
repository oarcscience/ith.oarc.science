### <span id="x.i-p0.1"></span>Introductory Notice

##### <span id="x.i-p0.2"></span>to the Homily Known as

### <span id="x.i-p0.3"></span>the Second Epistle of Clement.

<span id="x.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.i-p1.1"></span>It</span> is gratifying that our series is marked
by tokens of critical progress, and not less cheering tokens of
scientific research. The clearing-up of much that has perplexed us about
<span id="x.i-p1.2"></span>Hermas; the <span
id="x.i-p1.3"></span>Bryennios discovery; and, not least, the completion
of this fragment, which has long been a scandal to patristic
inquiry,—are surely such tokens. They enrich the reader with definite
ideas on many collateral subjects. May they not stimulate American
scholarship and American affluence to fresh enterprises of the same
character for the advancement of learning, and the glory of the world’s
Redeemer and Illuminator?  

<span id="x.i-p2"></span>The very early date to which this homily is now
assigned makes its slightest allusions to the New-Testament canon of
very great importance. I have ventured to indicate a few such, even
where they may be mere <span id="x.i-p2.1"></span>allusions, not textual
quotations: as, e.g., on p. 517, at notes 20 and 22, slight indications
of a reference to the Second Epistle of St. Peter and to the
Apocalypse. <span id="fr_3837"></span>[3838](#fn_3837)  

<span id="x.i-p4"></span>I shall have occasion to refer to this work in
the elucidation of the Liturgies which are to follow. If it be, as
Bishop <span id="x.i-p4.1"></span>Lightfoot supposes, a homily of the
second century, it may lend important retrospective aid to the student
of these volumes in other particulars; but, having entrusted this
interesting relic to the editorial care of a most competent scholar, I
shall not presume to anticipate his judgment in any matter. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3837"></span>[511:3838](0070474.htm#fr_3837) <span
id="x.i-p2.2"></span>

<span id="x.i-p3"></span> If this reference to [2 Pet. iii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009)<span id="x.i-p3.1"></span> be
probable, it is one of the earliest testimonies to the genuine character
of that Epistle. The true <span id="x.i-p3.2"></span>Clement has two
references to the same (pp. 8 and 11, vol. i., this series), and <span
id="x.i-p3.5"></span>Justin also (vol. i. p. 240) is credited with a
similar reference to <span id="x.i-p3.7"></span>2 Peter and the
Apocalypse. See <span id="x.i-p3.8"></span>Lardner, <span
id="x.i-p3.9"></span>Credib., vol. ii. p. 123 <span
id="x.i-p3.10"></span>et seq.
