#### <span id="ix.iii.viii-p0.1"></span>Sec. VIII.—On the Duty of Working for a Livelihood.

#### <span id="ix.iii.viii-p0.2"></span>That a Christian Who Will Not Work Must Not Eat, as Peter and the Rest of the Apostles Were Fishermen, But Paul and <span id="ix.iii.viii-p0.3"></span>Aquila Tentmakers, Jude the Son of James an Husbandman.

<span id="ix.iii.viii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>LXIII</span>. Let the young persons of the
Church endeavour to minister diligently in all necessaries: mind your
business with all becoming seriousness, that so you may always have
sufficient to support yourselves and those that are needy, and not
burden the Church of God. For we ourselves, besides our attention to the
word of the Gospel, do not neglect our inferior employments. For some of
us are fishermen, some tentmakers, some husbandmen, that so we may never
be idle. So says <span id="ix.iii.viii-p1.2"></span>Solomon somewhere:
“Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways diligently, and become
wiser than she. For she, having neither field, overseer, nor ruler,
prepareth her food in the summer, and layeth up a great store in the
harvest. Or else go to the bee, and learn how laborious she is, and her
work how valuable it is, whose labours both kings and mean men make use
of for their health. She is desirable and glorious, though she be weak
in strength, yet by honouring wisdom she is improved, etc. How long wilt
thou lie on thy bed, O sluggard? When wilt thou <span id="page_425">p.
425</span> <span id="ix.iii.viii-Page_425"></span>wake out of thy sleep?
Thou sleepest awhile thou liest down awhile, thou slumberest awhile,
thou foldest thy hands on thy breast to sleep awhile. Then poverty comes
on thee like an evil traveller, and want as a swift racer. But if thou
beest diligent, thy harvest shall come as a fountain, and want shall fly
from thee as an evil runagate.” <span
id="fr_2858"></span>[2859](#fn_2858) And again: “He that manageth his
own land shall be filled with bread.” <span
id="fr_2859"></span>[2860](#fn_2859) And elsewhere he says: “The
slothful has folded his own hands together, and has eaten his own
flesh.” <span id="fr_2860"></span>[2861](#fn_2860) And afterwards: “The
sluggard hides his hand; he will not be able to bring it to his
mouth.” <span id="fr_2861"></span>[2862](#fn_2861) And again: “By
slothfulness of the hands a floor will be brought low.” <span
id="fr_2862"></span>[2863](#fn_2862) Labour therefore continually; for
the blot of the slothful is not to be healed. But “if any one does not
work, let not such a one eat” <span id="fr_2863"></span>[2864](#fn_2863)
among you. For the Lord our God hates the slothful. For no one of those
who are dedicated to God ought to be idle.
