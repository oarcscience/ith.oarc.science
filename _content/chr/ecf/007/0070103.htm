<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iv.xxi-p1"></A>But when He had made arrangements with His disciples for the preaching of the Gospel and His name, a cloud suddenly surrounded Him, and carried Him up into heaven, on the fortieth day after His passion, as <a name="iii.ii.iv.xxi-p1.1"></A>Daniel had shown that it would be, saying:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_798"></A><A HREF="#fn_798"><FONT SIZE="1">799</FONT></A>
 &#8220;And, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days.&#8221; But the disciples, being dispersed through the provinces, everywhere laid the foundations of the Church, themselves also in the name of their divine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_799"></A><A HREF="#fn_799"><FONT SIZE="1">800</FONT></A>
 Master doing many and almost incredible miracles; for at His departure He had endowed them with power and strength, by which the system&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_800"></A><A HREF="#fn_800"><FONT SIZE="1">801</FONT></A>
 of their new announcement might be founded and confirmed. But He also opened to them all things which were about to happen, which <a name="iii.ii.iv.xxi-p4.1"></A>Peter and <a name="iii.ii.iv.xxi-p4.2"></A>Paul preached at Rome; and this preaching being written for the sake of remembrance,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_801"></A><A HREF="#fn_801"><FONT SIZE="1">802</FONT></A>
 became permanent, in which they both declared other wonderful things, and also said that it was about to come to pass, that after a short time God would send against them a king who would subdue&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_802"></A><A HREF="#fn_802"><FONT SIZE="1">803</FONT></A>
 the Jews, and level their cities to the ground, and besiege the people themselves, worn out with hunger and thirst. Then it should come to pass that they should feed on the bodies of their own children, and consume one another. Lastly, that they should be taken captive, and come into the hands of their enemies, and should see their wives most cruelly harassed before their eyes, their virgins ravished and polluted, their sons torn in pieces, their little ones dashed to the ground; and lastly, everything laid waste with fire and sword, the captives banished for ever from their own lands, because they had exulted over the well-beloved and most approved Son of God. And so, after their decease, when <a name="iii.ii.iv.xxi-p6.2"></A>Nero had put them to death, <a name="iii.ii.iv.xxi-p6.3"></A>Vespasian destroyed the name and nation of the Jews, and did all <A NAME="page_124"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 124</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.iv.xxi-Page_124"></A>things which they had foretold as about to come to pass. &#160;</p>
