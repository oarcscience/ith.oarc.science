<p> <a name="vi.ii.xviii"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="vi.ii.xviii-p0.1"></A>from the twentieth chapter.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.xviii-p1"></A><a name="vi.ii.xviii-p1.1"></A>1&#8211;3. &#8220;And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a chain in his hand. And he held the dragon, that old serpent, which is called the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, and cast him into the abyss, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be finished: after this he must be loosed a little season.&#8221;] Those years wherein Satan is bound are in the first advent of Christ, even to the end of the age; and they are called a thousand, according to that mode of speaking, wherein a part is signified by the whole, just as is that passage, &#8220;the word which He commanded for a thousand generations,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2309"></A><A HREF="#fn_2309"><FONT SIZE="1">2310</FONT></A>
 although they are not a thousand. Moreover that he says, &#8220;and he cast him into the abyss,&#8221; he says this, because the devil, excluded from the hearts of believers, began to take possession of the wicked, in whose hearts, blinded day by day, he is shut up as if in a profound abyss. And he shut him up, says he, and put a seal upon him, that he should not deceive the nations until the thousand years should be finished. &#8220;He shut the door upon him,&#8221; it is said, that is, he forbade and restrained his seducing those who belong to Christ. Moreover, he put a seal upon him, because it is hidden who belong to the side of the devil, and who to that of Christ. For we know not of those who seem to stand whether they shall not fall, and of those who are down it is uncertain whether they may rise. Moreover, that he says that he is bound and shut up, that he may not seduce the nations, the nations signify the Church, seeing that of them it itself is formed, and which being seduced, he previously held until, he says, the thousand years should be completed, that is, what is left of the sixth day, to wit, of the sixth age, which subsists for a thousand years; after this he must be loosed for a little season. The little season signifies three years and six months, in which with all his power the devil will avenge himself under Antichrist<A NAME="page_359"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 359</FONT></A> <a name="vi.ii.xviii-Page_359"></A> against the Church. Finally, he says, after that the devil shall be loosed, and will seduce the nations in the whole world, and will entice war against the Church, the number of whose foes shall be as the sand of the sea.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2310"></A><A HREF="#fn_2310"><FONT SIZE="1">2311</FONT></A>

<p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.xviii-p4"></A><a name="vi.ii.xviii-p4.1"></A>4, 5. &#8220;And I saw thrones, and them that sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them; and <span><a name="vi.ii.xviii-p4.2"></A>I saw</span> the souls of them that were slain on account of the testimony of <a name="vi.ii.xviii-p4.3"></A>Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast nor his image, nor have received his writing on their forehead or in their hand; and they reigned with Christ for a thousand years: the rest of them lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.&#8221;] There are two resurrections. But the first resurrection is now of the souls that are by the faith, which does not permit men to pass over to the second death. Of this resurrection the apostle says: &#8220;If ye have risen with Christ, seek those things which are above.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2311"></A><A HREF="#fn_2311"><FONT SIZE="1">2312</FONT></A>
 &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.xviii-p6"></A><a name="vi.ii.xviii-p6.1"></A>6. &#8220;Blessed and holy is he who has part in this resurrection: on them the second death shall have no power, but they shall be priests of God and Christ, and they shall reign with Him a thousand years.&#8221;] I do not think the reign of a thousand years is eternal; or if it is thus to be thought of, they cease to reign when the thousand years are finished. But I will put forward what my capacity enables me to judge. The tenfold number signifies the decalogue, and the hundredfold sets forth the crown of virginity: for he who shall have kept the undertaking of virginity completely, and shall have faithfully fulfilled the precepts of the decalogue, and shall have destroyed the untrained nature or impure thoughts within the retirement of the heart, that they may not rule over him, this is the true priest of Christ, and accomplishing the millenary number thoroughly, is thought to reign with Christ; and truly in his case the devil is bound. But he who is entangled in the vices and the dogmas of heretics, in his case the devil is loosed. But that it says that when the thousand years are finished he is loosed, so the number of the perfect saints being completed, in whom there is the glory of virginity in body and mind, by the approaching advent of the kingdom of the hateful one, many, seduced by that love of earthly things, shall be overthrown, and together with him shall enter the lake of fire. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="vi.ii.xviii-p7"></A><a name="vi.ii.xviii-p7.1"></A>8&#8211;10. &#8220;And they went up upon the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city; and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. And the devil who seduced them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where both the beast and the false prophet shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.&#8221;] This belongs to the last judgment. And after a little time the earth was made holy, as being at least that wherein lately had reposed the bodies of the virgins, when they shall enter upon an eternal kingdom with an immortal King, as they who are not only virgins in body, but, moreover, with equal inviolability have protected themselves, both in tongue and thought, from wickedness; and these, it shows, shall dwell in rejoicing for ever with the Lamb. &#160;</p>
