<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p1"></A>But let us come to the philosophers, whose authority is regarded as more certain than that of the poets. <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p1.1"></A>Plato asserts His monarchy, saying that there is but one God, by whom the world was prepared and completed with wonderful order. <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p1.2"></A>Aristotle, his disciple, admits that there is one mind which presides over the world. <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p1.3"></A>Antisthenes says that there is one who is God by nature,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1454"></A><A HREF="#fn_1454"><FONT SIZE="1">1455</FONT></A>
 the governor of the whole system. It would be a long task to recount the statements which have been made respecting the Supreme God, either by <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.2"></A>Thales, or by <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.3"></A>Pythagoras and <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.4"></A>Anaximenes before him, or afterwards by the Stoics <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.5"></A>Cleanthes and <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.6"></A>Chrysippus and <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.7"></A>Zeno, or of our countrymen, by <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.8"></A>Seneca following the Stoics, and by <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.9"></A>Tullius himself, since all these attempted to define the being of God,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1455"></A><A HREF="#fn_1455"><FONT SIZE="1">1456</FONT></A>
 and affirmed that the world is ruled by Him alone, and that He is not subject to any nature, since all nature derives its origin from Him. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p4"></A><a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p4.1"></A>Hermes, who, on account of his virtue and his knowledge of many arts, deserved the name of <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p4.2"></A>Trismegistus, who preceded the philosophers in the antiquity of his doctrine, and who is reverenced by the Egyptians as a god, in asserting the majesty of the one God with infinite praises, calls Him Lord and Father, and says that He is without a name because He does not stand in need of a proper name, inasmuch as He is alone, and that He has no parents, since He exists of Himself and by Himself. In writing to his son he thus begins: To understand God is difficult, to describe Him in speech is impossible, even for one to whom it is possible to understand Him; for the perfect cannot be comprehended by the imperfect, nor the invisible by the visible. &#160;</p>
