#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chap. X.—Of Jupiter, and His Licentious Life.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xi-p1"></span>But respecting the king and father
of all these, <span id="iii.ii.viii.xi-p1.1"></span>Jupiter, whom they
believe to possess the chief power in heaven,—what power <span
id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464) had he, who banished his father
<span id="iii.ii.viii.xi-p2.3"></span>Saturnus from his kingdom, and
pursued him with arms when he fled? What self-restraint had he, who
indulged every kind of lust? For he made <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xi-p2.4"></span>Alcmena and <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xi-p2.5"></span>Leda, the wives of great men, infamous
through his adultery: he also, captivated with the beauty of a boy,
carried him off with violence as he was hunting and meditating manly
things, that he might treat him as a woman. Why should I mention his
debaucheries of virgins? and how great a multitude of these there was,
is shown by the number of his sons. In the case of <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xi-p2.6"></span>Thetis alone he was more temperate. For
it bad been predicted that the son whom she should bring forth would be
more powerful than his father. Therefore he struggled with his love,
that one might not be born greater than himself. He knew, therefore,
that he was not of perfect virtue, greatness, and power, since he feared
that which he himself had done to his father. Why, therefore, is he
called best and greatest, since he both contaminated himself with
faults, which is the part of one who is unjust and bad, and feared a
greater than himself, which is the part of one who is weak and inferior?

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xi-p2"></span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xi-p2.1"></span>Quid potestatis. Others read “<span
id="iii.ii.viii.xi-p2.2"></span>pietatis,” which appears more suitable
to the sense of the passage.
