<p> <a name="iii.ii.viii.l"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.viii.l-p0.1"></A>Chap. LIV.&#8212;Of the Freedom of Religion in the Worship of God.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.l-p1"></A>These things may indeed be said with justice. But who will hear, when men of furious and unbridled spirit think that their authority is diminished if there is any freedom in the affairs of men? But it is religion alone in which freedom has placed its dwelling. For it is a matter which is voluntary above all others, nor can necessity be imposed upon any, so as to worship that which he does not wish to worship.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1566"></A><A HREF="#fn_1566"><FONT SIZE="1">1567</FONT></A>
 Some one may perhaps pretend, he cannot wish it. In short, some, through fear of torments, or overcome by tortures, have assented to detestable sacrifices: they never do that voluntarily which they did from necessity; but when the opportunity is again given to them, and liberty restored, they again betake themselves to God, and appease Him with prayers and tears, repenting not of the will, which they had not, but of the necessity which they endured; and pardon is not denied to those who make satisfaction. What then does he accomplish who pollutes the body, since he cannot change the will? &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.l-p3"></A>But, in fact, men of weak understanding, if they have induced any man of spirit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1567"></A><A HREF="#fn_1567"><FONT SIZE="1">1568</FONT></A>
 to sacrifice to their gods, with incredible alacrity insolently exult, and rejoice, as though they had sent an enemy under the yoke. But if any one, neither frightened by threats nor by tortures, shall have chosen to prefer his faith to his life, cruelty puts forth all its ingenuity against him, plans dreadful and intolerable things; and because they know that death for the cause of God is glorious, and that this is a victory on our side, if, having overcome the torturers, we lay down our life in behalf of the faith and religion, they also themselves strive to conquer us. They do not put us to death, but they search out new and unheard-of tortures, that the frailty of the flesh may yield to pains, and if it does not yield, they put off further punishment, and apply diligent care to the wounds, that while the scars are yet fresh, a repetition of the torture may inflict more pain; and while they practice this torture&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1568"></A><A HREF="#fn_1568"><FONT SIZE="1">1569</FONT></A>
 upon the innocent, they evidently consider themselves pious, and just, and religious (for they are delighted with such sacrifices to their gods), but they term the others impious and desperate. What perversity is this, that he who is punished, though innocent, should be called desperate and impious, and that the torturer, on the other hand, should be called just and pious! &#160;</p>
