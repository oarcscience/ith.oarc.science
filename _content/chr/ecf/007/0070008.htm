<p> <a name="iii.ii.i.iii"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.i.iii-p0.1"></A>Chap. II.&#8212;That there is a providence in the affairs of men.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.iii-p1"></A>Having therefore undertaken the office of explaining the truth, I did not think it so necessary to take my commencement from that inquiry which naturally seems the first, whether there is a providence which consults for all things, or all things were either made or are governed by chance; which sentiment was introduced by <a name="iii.ii.i.iii-p1.1"></A>Democritus, and confirmed by <a name="iii.ii.i.iii-p1.2"></A>Epicurus. But before them, what did <a name="iii.ii.i.iii-p1.3"></A>Protagoras effect, who raised doubts respecting the gods; or <a name="iii.ii.i.iii-p1.4"></A>Diagoras afterwards, who excluded them; and some others, who did not hold the existence of gods, except that there was supposed to be no providence? These, however, were most vigorously opposed by the other philosophers, and especially by the Stoics, who taught that the universe could neither have been made without divine intelligence, nor continue to exist unless it were governed by the highest intelligence. But even <a name="iii.ii.i.iii-p1.5"></A>Marcus Tullius, although he was a defender of the Academic system, discussed at length and on many occasions respecting the providence which governs affairs, confirming the arguments of the Stoics, and himself adducing many new ones; and this he does both in all the books of his own philosophy, and especially in those which treat of the nature of the gods.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A>
  &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.iii-p3"></A>And it was no difficult task, indeed, to refute the falsehoods of a few men who entertained perverse sentiments by the testimony of communities and tribes, who on this one point had no disagreement. For there is no one so uncivilized, and of such an uncultivated disposition, who, when he raises his eyes to heaven, although he knows not by the providence of what God all this visible universe is governed, does not understand from the very magnitude of the objects, from their motion, arrangement, constancy, usefulness, beauty, and temperament, that there is some providence, and that that which exists with wonderful method must have been prepared by some greater intelligence. And for us, assuredly, it is very easy to follow up this part as copiously as it may please us. But because the subject has been much agitated among philosophers, and they who take away providence appear to have been sufficiently answered by men of sagacity and eloquence, and because it is necessary to speak, in different places throughout this work which we have undertaken, respecting the skill of the divine providence, let us for the present omit this inquiry, which is so closely connected with the other questions, that it seems possible for us to discuss no subject, without at the same time discussing the subject of providence. &#160;</p>
