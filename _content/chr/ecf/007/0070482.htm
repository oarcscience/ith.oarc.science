<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p134"></A>Woe to me, woe to me, who have been astonied, because I am a man of polluted lips, and dwell among a people of polluted lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the mighty Lord.

<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p135"></A>Now, I pray, may Thy grace be with us, O Lord; purge away our impurities, and sanctify our lips; unite the voices of our insignificance with the sanctification of seraphim and archangels.

<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p151"></A>The Priest says this prayer of inclination in secret:&#8212; &#160;</p>

We also, O Lord: &#160;</p>

And on account of the whole of Thy wonderful dispensation towards us, we shall render thanks unto Thee, and glorify Thee without ceasing in Thy Church, redeemed by the precious blood of Thy Christ, with open mouths and joyful countenances: &#160;</p>

<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p163"></A>The Priest signs the mysteries with the cross, and they respond:&#8212; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p164"></A>Amen. &#160;</p>  
<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p165"></A>The Priest bows himself and kisses the altar, first in the middle, then at the two sides right and left, and says this prayer:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4247"></A><A HREF="#fn_4247"><FONT SIZE="1">4248</FONT></A>

 but especially in Thy Holy Catholic Church; grant that the priesthood with the government may have peace; cause wars to cease from the ends of the earth, and scatter the nations that delight in wars,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4252"></A><A HREF="#fn_4252"><FONT SIZE="1">4253</FONT></A>
 that we may enjoy the blessing of living in tranquillity and peace, in all temperance and fear of God. Spare the offences and sins of the dead, through Thy grace and mercies for ever. &#160;</p>  
<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p175"></A>And to those who are around the altar he says:&#8212; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p176"></A>Bless, O Lord. Bless, O Lord. &#160;</p>  
<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p177"></A>And he puts on the incense with which he fumes himself, and says:&#8212; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p178"></A>Sweeten, O Lord our God, the unpleasing savour&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4253"></A><A HREF="#fn_4253"><FONT SIZE="1">4254</FONT></A>
 of our souls through the sweetness of Thy <A NAME="page_566"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 566</FONT></A> <a name="xii.iv-Page_566"></A>love, and through it cleanse me from the stains of my sin, and forgive me my offences and sins, whether known or unknown to me. &#160;</p>  
<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p180"></A>A second time he takes the incense with both hands, and censes the mysteries; presently he says:&#8212; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p181"></A>The clemency of Thy grace, O our Lord and God, gives us access to these renowned, holy, life-giving, and divine mysteries, unworthy though we be. &#160;</p>  
<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p182"></A>The Priest repeats these words once and again, and at each interval unites his hands over his breast in the form of a cross. He kisses the altar in the middle, and receives with both hands the upper oblation; and looking up, says:&#8212; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p183"></A>Praise be to Thy holy name, O Lord <a name="xii.iv-p183.1"></A>Jesus Christ, and adoration to Thy majesty, always and for ever. Amen. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p184"></A>For He is the living and life-giving bread which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to the whole world, of which they who eat die not; and they who receive it are saved by it, and do not see corruption, and live through it for ever; and Thou art the antidote of our mortality,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4254"></A><A HREF="#fn_4254"><FONT SIZE="1">4255</FONT></A>
 and the resurrection of our entire frame.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4255"></A><A HREF="#fn_4255"><FONT SIZE="1">4256</FONT></A>

 in the form of a cross; in such a way, however, that his lips do not touch it, but appear to kiss it; and he says:&#8212; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p192"></A>Glory to Thee, O Lord; glory to Thee, O Lord, on account of Thine unspeakable gift to us, for ever. &#160;</p>  
<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p193"></A>Then he draws nigh to the fraction of the host,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4258"></A><A HREF="#fn_4258"><FONT SIZE="1">4259</FONT></A>
 which he accomplishes with both his hands, saying:&#8212; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p195"></A>We draw nigh, O Lord, with true faith, and break with thanksgiving and sign through Thy mercy the body and blood of our Life-giver, <a name="xii.iv-p195.1"></A>Jesus Christ, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. &#160;</p>  
<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p196"></A>And, naming the Trinity, he breaks the host,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4259"></A><A HREF="#fn_4259"><FONT SIZE="1">4260</FONT></A>
 which he holds in his hands, into two parts: and the one which is in his left hand he lays down on the disk; with the other, which he holds in his right hand, he signs the chalice, saying:&#8212; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p198"></A>The precious blood is signed with the holy body of our Lord <a name="xii.iv-p198.1"></A>Jesus Christ. In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost for ever. &#160;</p>  
<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p199"></A>And they respond:&#8212; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p200"></A>Amen. &#160;</p>  
<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p201"></A>Then he dips it even to the middle in the chalice, and signs with it the body which is in the paten, saying:&#8212; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p202"></A>The holy body is signed with the propitiatory blood of our Lord <a name="xii.iv-p202.1"></A>Jesus Christ. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost for ever. &#160;</p>  
<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p203"></A>And they respond:&#8212; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p204"></A>Amen. &#160;</p>  
<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p205"></A>And he unites the two parts, the one with the other, saying:&#8212; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p206"></A>Divided, sanctified, completed, perfected, united, and commingled have been these renowned, holy, life-giving, and divine mysteries, the one with the other, in the adorable and glorious name of Thy glorious Trinity, O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, that they may be to us, O Lord, for the propitiation of our offences and the forgiveness of our sins; also for the grand hope of a resurrection from the dead, and of a new life in the kingdom of the heavens, for us and for the Holy Church of Christ our Lord, here and in every place whatsoever, now and always, and for ever. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p207"></A>XVII. <span><a name="xii.iv-p207.1"></A>In the meantime he signs the host</span>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4260"></A><A HREF="#fn_4260"><FONT SIZE="1">4261</FONT></A>
<span><a name="xii.iv-p208.3"></A> with his right thumb in the form of a cross from the lower part to the upper, and from the right to the left, and thus forms a slight fissure in it where it has been dipped in the blood. He puts a part of it into the chalice in the form of a cross: the lower part is placed towards the priest, the upper towards the chalice, so that the place of the fissure looks to the chalice. He bows, and rising, says:&#8212;</span> &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p209"></A>Glory be to Thee, O Lord <a name="xii.iv-p209.1"></A>Jesus Christ, who hast made me, unworthy though I be, through Thy grace, a minister and mediator of Thy renowed, holy, life-giving, and divine mysteries: through the grace of Thy mercy, make me worthy of the pardon of my offences and the forgiveness of my sins. <A NAME="page_567"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 567</FONT></A> <a name="xii.iv-Page_567"></A> &#160;</p>  
<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p210"></A>He signs himself with the sign of the cross an his forehead, and does the same to those standing round him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4261"></A><A HREF="#fn_4261"><FONT SIZE="1">4262</FONT></A>
  &#160;</p>  
<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p214"></A>The Deacons approach, and he signs each one of them on the forehead, saying:&#8212; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p215"></A>Christ accept thy ministry: Christ cause thy face to shine: Christ save thy life: Christ make thy youth to grow. &#160;</p>

<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p217"></A>Christ accept thy oblation. &#160;</p>  
<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p218"></A>XVIII. All return to their own place; and the Priest, after bowing, rises and says, in the tone of the Gospel:&#8212; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="xii.iv-p219"></A>The grace of our Lord <a name="xii.iv-p219.1"></A>Jesus Christ, and the love of God the Father, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with us all. &#160;</p>  
<p class="Heading7"><a name="xii.iv-p220"></A>The Priest signs himself, and lifts up his hand over his head, so that it should be in the air, and the people be partakers in the singing:&#8212; &#160;</p>
