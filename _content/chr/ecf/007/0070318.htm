<p> <a name="iii.v.ix"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.v.ix-p0.1"></A>Chap. IX.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.ix-p1"></A>But the other <a name="iii.v.ix-p1.1"></A>Maximian (<a name="iii.v.ix-p1.2"></A>Galerius), chosen by <a name="iii.v.ix-p1.3"></A>Diocletian for his son-in-law, was worse, not only than those two princes whom our own times have experienced, but worse than all the bad princes of former days. In this wild beast there dwelt a native barbarity and a savageness foreign to Roman blood; and no wonder, for his mother was born beyond the Danube, and it was an inroad of the Carpi that obliged her to cross over and take refuge in New Dacia. The form of <a name="iii.v.ix-p1.4"></A>Galerius corresponded with his manners. Of stature tall, full of flesh, and swollen to a horrible bulk of corpulency; by his speech, gestures, and looks, he made himself a terror to all that came near him. His father-in-law, too, dreaded him excessively. The cause was this. <a name="iii.v.ix-p1.5"></A>Narseus, king of the Persians, emulating the example set him by his grandfather <a name="iii.v.ix-p1.6"></A>Sapores, assembled a great army, and aimed at becoming master of the eastern provinces of the Roman empire. <a name="iii.v.ix-p1.7"></A>Diocletian, apt to be low-spirited and timorous in every commotion, and fearing a fate like that of <a name="iii.v.ix-p1.8"></A>Valerian, would not in person encounter <a name="iii.v.ix-p1.9"></A>Narseus; but he sent <a name="iii.v.ix-p1.10"></A>Galerius by the way of Armenia, while he himself halted in the eastern provinces, and anxiously watched the event. It is a custom amongst the barbarians to take everything that belongs to them into the field. <a name="iii.v.ix-p1.11"></A>Galerius laid an ambush for them, and easily overthrew men embarrassed with the multitude of their followers and with their baggage. Having put <a name="iii.v.ix-p1.12"></A>Narseus to flight, and returned with much spoil, his own pride and <a name="iii.v.ix-p1.13"></A>Diocletian&#146;s fears were greatly increased. For after this victory he rose to such a pitch of haughtiness as to reject the appellation of C&aelig;sar;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1968"></A><A HREF="#fn_1968"><FONT SIZE="1">1969</FONT></A>
 and when he heard that appellation in letters addressed to him, he cried out, with a stern look and terrible voice, &#8220;How long am I to be <span><a name="iii.v.ix-p2.2"></A>C&aelig;sar</span>? &#8220;Then he began to act extravagantly, insomuch that, as if he had been a second <a name="iii.v.ix-p2.3"></A>Romulus, he wished to pass for and to be called the offspring of <a name="iii.v.ix-p2.4"></A>Mars; and that he might appear the issue of a divinity, he was willing that his mother <a name="iii.v.ix-p2.5"></A>Romula should be dishonoured with the name of adulteress. But, not to confound the chronological order of events, I delay the recital of his actions; for indeed afterwards, when <a name="iii.v.ix-p2.6"></A>Galerius got the title of emperor, his father-in-law having been divested of the imperial purple, he became altogether outrageous, and of unbounded arrogance. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.ix-p3"></A>While by such a conduct, and with such associates, <a name="iii.v.ix-p3.1"></A>Diocles&#8212;for <span><a name="iii.v.ix-p3.2"></A>that</span> was the name of <a name="iii.v.ix-p3.3"></A>Diocletian before he attained sovereignty&#8212;occupied himself in subverting the commonweal, there was no evil which his crimes did not deserve: nevertheless he reigned most prosperously, as long as he forbore to defile his hands with the blood of the just; and what cause he had for persecuting them, I come now to explain. &#160;</p>
