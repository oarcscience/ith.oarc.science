#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chap. VII.—Of the Wicked Life and Death of Hercules.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.viii-p1"></span>But though almost all nations are
persuaded that they are gods, yet their actions, as related both by
poets and historians, declare that they were men. Who is ignorant of the
times in which <span id="iii.ii.viii.viii-p1.1"></span>Hercules lived,
since he both sailed with the Argonauts on their expedition, and having
stormed Troy, slew <span id="iii.ii.viii.viii-p1.2"></span>Laomedon, the
father of <span id="iii.ii.viii.viii-p1.3"></span>Priam, on account of
his perjury? From that time rather more than fifteen hundred years are
reckoned. He is said not even to have been born honourably, but to have
been sprung from <span id="iii.ii.viii.viii-p1.4"></span>Alcmena by
adultery, and to have been himself addicted to the vices of his father.
He never abstained from women, or males, and traversed the whole world,
not so much for the sake of glory as of lust, nor so much for the
slaughter of beasts as for the begetting of children. And though he was
unvanquished, yet he was triumphed over by <span
id="iii.ii.viii.viii-p1.5"></span>Omphale alone, to whom he gave up his
club and lion’s skin; and being clothed in a woman’s garment, and
crouching at a woman’s feet, he received his task <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458) to execute. He afterwards, in a
transport of frenzy, killed his little children and his wife <span
id="iii.ii.viii.viii-p2.3"></span>Megara. At last, having put on a
garment sent by his wife <span
id="iii.ii.viii.viii-p2.4"></span>Deianyra, when he was perishing
through ulcers, being unable to endure the pain, he constructed for
himself a funeral pile on Mount Œta, and burnt himself alive. Thus it is
effected, that although on account of his excellence <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459) he might have been believed to be a
god, nevertheless on account of these things be is believed to have been
a man.
