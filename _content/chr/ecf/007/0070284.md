#### <span id="iii.iii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXI.—Of the Anger of God and Man.

<span id="iii.iii.xxi-p1"></span>There remains one question, and that
the last. For some one will perhaps say, that God is so far from being
angry, that in His precepts He even forbids man to be angry. I might say
that the anger of man ought to be curbed, because he is often angry
unjustly; and he has immediate emotion, because he is only for a
time. <span id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771) Therefore, lest those
things should be done which the low, and those of moderate station, and
great kings do in their anger, his rage ought to have been moderated and
suppressed, lest, being out of his mind, <span
id="fr_1772"></span>[1773](#fn_1772) he should commit some inexpiable
crime. But God is not angry for a short time, <span
id="fr_1773"></span>[1774](#fn_1773) because He is eternal and of
perfect virtue, and He is never angry unless deservedly. But, however,
the matter is not so; for if He should altogether prohibit anger, He
Himself would have been in some measure the censurer of His own
workmanship, since He from the beginning had inserted anger in the
liver <span id="fr_1774"></span>[1775](#fn_1774) of man, since it is
believed that the cause of this emotion is contained in the moisture of
the gall. Therefore He does not altogether prohibit anger, because that
affection is necessarily given, but He forbids us to persevere in anger.
For the anger of mortals ought to be mortal; for if it is lasting,
enmity is strengthened to lasting destruction. Then, again, when He
enjoined us to be angry, and yet not to sin, <span
id="fr_1775"></span>[1776](#fn_1775) it is plain that He did not tear up
anger by the roots, but restrained it, that in every correction we might
preserve moderation and justice. Therefore He who commands us to be
angry is manifestly Himself angry; He who enjoins us to be quickly
appeased is manifestly Himself easy to be appeased: for He has enjoined
those things which are just and useful for the interests of
society. <span id="fr_1776"></span>[1777](#fn_1776)  

<span id="iii.iii.xxi-p8"></span>But because I had said that the anger
of God is not for a time <span id="fr_1777"></span>[1778](#fn_1777)
only, as is the case with man, who becomes inflamed with an
immediate <span id="fr_1778"></span>[1779](#fn_1778) excitement, and on
account of his frailty is unable easily to govern himself, we ought to
understand that because God is eternal, His anger also remains to
eternity; but, on the other hand, that because He is endued with the
greatest excellence, He controls His anger, and is not ruled by it, but
that He regulates it according to His will. And it is plain that this is
not opposed to that which has just been said. For if His anger had been
altogether immortal, there would be no place after a fault for
satisfaction or kind feeling, though He Himself commands men to be
reconciled before the setting of the sun. <span
id="fr_1779"></span>[1780](#fn_1779) But the divine anger remains for
ever against those who ever sin. Therefore God is appeased not by
incense or a victim, not by costly offerings, which things are all
corruptible, but by a reformation of the morals: and he who ceases to
sin renders the anger of God mortal. For this reason He does not
immediately <span id="fr_1780"></span>[1781](#fn_1780) punish every one
who is guilty, that man may have the opportunity of coming to a right
mind, <span id="fr_1781"></span>[1782](#fn_1781) and correcting himself.
