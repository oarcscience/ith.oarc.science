#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chap. VI.—Since God is Eternal and Immortal, He Does Not Stand in Need of Sex and Succession.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.vii-p1"></span>These testimonies, therefore, so
many and so great, clearly teach that there is but one government in the
world, and one power, the origin of which cannot be imagined, or its
force described. They are foolish, therefore, who imagine that the gods
were born of marriage, since the sexes themselves, and the intercourse
between them, were given to mortals by God for this reason, that every
race might be preserved by a succession of offspring. But what need have
the immortals either of sex or succession since neither pleasure nor
death affects them? Those, therefore, who are reckoned as gods, since it
is evident that they were born as men, and that they begat others, were
plainly mortals: but they were believed to be gods, because, when they
were great and powerful kings, on account of the benefits which they had
conferred upon men, they deserved to obtain divine honours after death;
and temples and statues being erected to them, their memory was retained
and celebrated as that of immortals.
