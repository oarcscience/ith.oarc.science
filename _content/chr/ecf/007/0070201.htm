<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p1"></A><a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p1.1"></A>Tarquitius relates that <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p1.2"></A>&AElig;sculapius was born of doubtful parents, and that on this account he was exposed; and being taken up by hunters, and fed by the teats of a hound, was given to <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p1.3"></A>Chiron for instruction. He lived at Epidaurus, and was buried at Cynosur&aelig;, as <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p1.4"></A>Cicero says,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1460"></A><A HREF="#fn_1460"><FONT SIZE="1">1461</FONT></A>

 and when he had unintentionally killed a boy whom he loved, he inscribed his own lamentations on a flower. <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p3.6"></A>Mars, a man of the greatest bravery, was not free from the charge of adultery, since he was made a spectacle, being bound with a chain together with the adulteress. &#160;</p>

 herself, while she lived in Phrygia after the banishment and death of her husband, though a widow, and aged, was enamoured of a beautiful youth; and because he was not faithful, she mutilated, and rendered him effeminate: on which account even now she delights in the <a name="iii.ii.viii.ix-p5.3"></A>Galli&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1463"></A><A HREF="#fn_1463"><FONT SIZE="1">1464</FONT></A>
