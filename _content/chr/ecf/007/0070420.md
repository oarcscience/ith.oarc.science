#### <span id="viii.iii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII. <span id="fr_2479"></span>[2480](#fn_2479) —Reception of Christians.

<span id="viii.iii.xii-p2"></span>1. But let every one that cometh in
the name of the Lord be received, <span
id="fr_2480"></span>[2481](#fn_2480) and afterward ye shall prove and
know him; for ye shall have understanding right and left. 2. If he who
cometh is a wayfarer, assist him as far as ye are able; but he shall not
remain with you, except for two or three days, if need be. 3. But if he
willeth to abide with you, being an artisan, let him work and eat; <span
id="fr_2481"></span>[2482](#fn_2481) but if he hath no trade, 4.
according to your understanding see to it that, as a Christian, <span
id="fr_2482"></span>[2483](#fn_2482) he shall not live with you idle. 5.
But if he willeth not to do, he is a Christ-monger. <span
id="fr_2483"></span>[2484](#fn_2483) Watch that ye keep aloof from such.

id="viii.iii.xii-p0.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.xii-p1"></span> Verse 1 is almost identical with the
beginning of <span id="viii.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Apostolic
Constitutions, vii. 28; the remaining verses have no parallel.  

<span id="fn_2480"></span>[381:2481](0070420.htm#fr_2480) <span
id="viii.iii.xii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.xii-p3"></span> All professed Christians are meant.  

<span id="fn_2481"></span>[381:2482](0070420.htm#fr_2481) <span

<span id="viii.iii.xii-p4"></span> Comp. [2 Thess. iii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#010)<span
id="viii.iii.xii-p4.1"></span>.  

<span id="fn_2482"></span>[381:2483](0070420.htm#fr_2482) <span
id="viii.iii.xii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.xii-p5"></span> The term occurs only here in the
<span id="viii.iii.xii-p5.1"></span>Teaching.  

<span id="fn_2483"></span>[381:2484](0070420.htm#fr_2483) <span
id="viii.iii.xii-p5.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.xii-p6"></span> “Christ-trafficker.” The abuse of
Christian fellowship and hospitality naturally followed the remarkable
extension of Christianity. This expressive term was coined to designate
the class of idlers who would make gain out of their professed
Christianity. It occurs in the longer form of the Ignatian Epistles
(<span id="viii.iii.xii-p6.1"></span>Trallians, vi.) and in literature
of the fourth century.
