<span id="iii.ii.v.iv"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.v.iv-p0.1"></span>Chap. IV.—Why This Work Was Published, and Again of Tertullian and Cyprian.

<span id="iii.ii.v.iv-p1"></span>Since, therefore, they of whom I have
spoken had set forth their sacrilegious writings in my presence, and to
my grief, being incited both by the arrogant impiety of these, and by
the consciousness of truth itself, and (as I think) by God, I have
undertaken this office, that with all the strength of my mind I might
refute the accusers of righteousness; not that I should write against
these, who might be crushed with a few words, but that I might once for
all by one attack overthrow all who everywhere effect, or have effected,
the same work. For I do not doubt that very many others, and in many
places, and that not only in Greek, but also in Latin writings, have
raised a monument of their own unrighteousness. And since I was not able
to reply to these separately, I thought that this cause was to be so
<span id="page_140">p. 140</span> <span
id="iii.ii.v.iv-Page_140"></span>pleaded by me that I might overthrow
former writers, together with all their writings, and cut off from
future writers the whole power of writing and of replying. <span
id="fr_951"></span>[952](#fn_951) Only let them attend, and I will
assuredly effect that whosoever shall know these things, must either
embrace that which he before condemned, or, which is next to it, cease
at length to deride it. Although <span
id="iii.ii.v.iv-p2.3"></span>Tertullian fully pleaded the same cause in
that treatise which is entitled the <span
id="iii.ii.v.iv-p2.4"></span>Apology, <span
id="fr_952"></span>[953](#fn_952) yet, inasmuch as it is one thing to
answer accusers, which consists in defence or denial only, and another
thing to instruct, which we do, in which the substance of the whole
system must be contained, I have not shrunk from this labour, that I
might complete the subject, which <span
id="iii.ii.v.iv-p3.2"></span>Cyprian did not fully carry out in that
discourse in which he endeavours to refute <span
id="iii.ii.v.iv-p3.3"></span>Demetrianus (as he himself says) railing at
and clamouring <span id="fr_953"></span>[954](#fn_953) against the
truth. Which subject he did not handle as he ought to have done; for he
ought to have been refuted not by the testimonies of Scripture, which he
plainly considered vain, fictitious, and false, but by arguments and
reason. For, since he was contending against a man who was ignorant of
the truth, he ought for a while to have laid aside divine readings, and
to have formed from the beginning this man as one who was altogether
ignorant, <span id="fr_954"></span>[955](#fn_954) and to have shown to
him by degrees the beginnings of light, that he might not be
dazzled, <span id="fr_955"></span>[956](#fn_955) the whole of its
brightness being presented to him. <span
id="fr_956"></span>[957](#fn_956)  

<span id="iii.ii.v.iv-p8"></span>For as an infant is unable, on account
of the tenderness of its stomach, to receive the nourishment of solid
and strong food, but is supported by liquid and soft milk, until, its
strength being confirmed, it can feed on stronger nourishment; so also
it was befitting that this man, because he was not yet capable of
receiving divine things, should be presented with human testimonies—that
is, of philosophers and historians—in order that he might especially be
refuted by his own authorities. And since he did not do this, being
carried away by his distinguished knowledge of the sacred writings, so
that he was content with those things alone in which faith consists, I
have undertaken, with the favour of God, to do this, and at the same
time to prepare the way for the imitation of others. And if, through my
exhortation, learned and eloquent men shall begin to betake themselves
to this subject, and shall choose to display their talents and power of
speaking in this field of truth, no one can doubt that false religions
will quickly disappear, and philosophy altogether fall, if all shall be
persuaded that this alone is religion and the only true wisdom. But I
have wandered from the subject further than I wished.
