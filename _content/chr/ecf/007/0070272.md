#### <span id="iii.iii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chap. IX.—Of the Providence of God, and of Opinions Opposed to It.

<span id="iii.iii.ix-p1"></span>When the philosophers of former times
had agreed in their opinions respecting providence, and there was no
doubt but that the world was set in order by God and reason, and was
governed by reason, <span id="iii.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Protagoras, in the
times of <span id="iii.iii.ix-p1.2"></span>Socrates, was the first of
all who said that it was not clear to him whether there was any divinity
or not. And this disputation of his was judged so impious, and so
contrary to the truth and to religion, that the Athenians both banished
him from their territories, and burnt in a public assembly those books
of his in which these statements were contained. But there is no need to
speak respecting his opinions, because he pronounced nothing certain.
After these things <span id="iii.iii.ix-p1.3"></span>Socrates and his
disciple <span id="iii.iii.ix-p1.4"></span>Plato, and those who flowed
forth from the school of <span id="iii.iii.ix-p1.5"></span>Plato like
rivulets into different directions, namely, the Stoics and Peripatetics,
were of the same opinion as those who went before them. <span
id="fr_1665"></span>[1666](#fn_1665)  

<span id="iii.iii.ix-p3"></span>Afterwards <span
id="iii.iii.ix-p3.1"></span>Epicurus said that there was indeed a God,
because it was necessary that there should be in the world some being of
surpassing excellence, distinction, and blessedness; yet that there was
no providence, and thus that the world itself was ordered by no plan,
nor art, nor workmanship, but that the universe was made up of certain
minute and indivisible seeds. But I do not see what can be said more
repugnant to the truth. For if there is a God, as God He is manifestly
provident; nor can divinity be attributed to Him in any other way than
if He retains the past, and knows the present, and foresees the future.
Therefore, in taking away providence, he also denied the existence of
God. But when he openly acknowledged the existence of God, at the same
time he also admitted His providence for the one cannot exist at all, or
be understood, without the other. But in those later times in which
philosophy had now lost its vigour  <span
id="fr_1666"></span>[1667](#fn_1666) there lived a certain <span
id="iii.iii.ix-p4.2"></span>Diagoras of Melos, <span
id="fr_1667"></span>[1668](#fn_1667) who altogether denied the existence
of God, and on account of this sentiment was called atheist; <span
id="fr_1668"></span>[1669](#fn_1668) also <span
id="iii.iii.ix-p6.3"></span>Theodorus <span
id="fr_1669"></span>[1670](#fn_1669) of Cyrene: both of whom, because
they were unable to discover anything new, all things having already
been said and found out, preferred even, in opposition to the truth, to
deny that in which all preceding <span id="page_265">p. 265</span> <span
id="iii.iii.ix-Page_265"></span>philosophers had agreed without any
ambiguity. These are they who attacked providence, which had been
asserted and defended through so many ages by so many intellects. What
then? Shall we refute those trifling and inactive philosophers by
reason, or by the authority of distinguished men, or rather by both? But
we must hasten onwards, lest our speech should wander too far from our
subject.
