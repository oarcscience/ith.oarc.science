#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p0.1"></span>Chap. VIII.—Of the Birth of <span id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p0.2"></span>Jesus in the Spirit and in the Flesh: of Spirits and the Testimonies of Prophets.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p1"></span>For we especially testify that He
was twice born, first in the spirit, and afterwards in the flesh. Whence
it is thus spoken by <span
id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Jeremiah: <span
id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532) “Before I formed Thee in the womb I
knew Thee.” And likewise by the same: “Who was blessed before He was
born;” <span id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533) which was the case with
no one else but Christ. For though He was the Son of God from the
beginning, <span id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534) He was born
again <span id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535) a second time <span
id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536) according to the flesh: and this
twofold birth of His has introduced great terror into the minds of men,
and overspread with darkness even those who retained the mysteries of
true religion. But we will show this plainly and clearly, that they who
love wisdom may be more easily and diligently instructed. He who hears
the Son of God mentioned ought not to conceive in his mind so great
impiety as to think that God begat Him by marriage and union with a
woman, which none does but an animal possessed of a body, and subject to
death. But with whom could God unite Himself, since He is alone? or
since His power was so great, that He accomplished whatever He wished,
assuredly He did not require the co-operation <span
id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537) of another for procreation. Unless by
chance we shall \[profanely\] imagine, as <span
id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p7.2"></span>Orpheus supposed, that God is both male
and female, because otherwise He would have been unable to beget, unless
He had the power of each sex, as though He could have intercourse with
Himself, or without such intercourse be unable to produce.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p8"></span>But Hermes also was of the same
opinion, when he says that He was “His own father,” and “His own
mother.” <span id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538) But if this were so, as
He is called by the prophets father, so also He would be called mother.
In what manner, then, did He beget Him? First of all, divine operations
cannot be known or declared <span id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539) by
any one; but nevertheless the sacred writings teach us, in which it is
laid down <span id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540) that this Son of God
is the speech, or even the reason <span
id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541) of God, and also <span
id="page_107">p. 107</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.viii-Page_107"></span>that the other angels are
spirits <span id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542) of God. For speech is
breath sent forth with a voice signifying something. But, however, since
breath and speech are sent forth from different parts, inasmuch as
breath proceeds from the nostrils, speech from the mouth, the difference
between the Son of God and the other angels is great. For they proceeded
from God as silent spirits, because they were not created to teach <span
id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543) the knowledge of God, but for His
service. But though He is Himself also a spirit, yet He proceeded from
the mouth of God with voice and sound, as the Word, on this account
indeed, because He was about to make use of His voice to the people;
that is, because He was about to be a teacher of the knowledge of God,
and of the heavenly mystery <span id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544) to
be revealed to man: which word also God Himself first spoke, that
through Him He might speak to us, and that He might reveal to us the
voice and will of God.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p16"></span>With good reason, therefore, is He
called the Speech and the Word of God, because God, by a certain
incomprehensible energy and power of His majesty, enclosed the vocal
spirit proceeding from His mouth, which he had not conceived in the
womb, but in His mind, within a form which has life through its own
perception and wisdom, and He also fashioned other spirits of His into
angels. Our spirits <span id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545) are liable
to dissolution, because we are mortal: but the spirits of God both live,
and are lasting, and have perception; because He Himself is immortal,
and the Giver both of perception <span id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546)
and life. Our expressions, although they are mingled with the air, and
fade away, yet generally remain comprised in letters; how much more must
we believe that the voice of God both remains for ever, and is
accompanied with perception and power, which it has derived from God the
Father, as a stream from its fountain! But if any one wonders that God
could be produced from God by a putting forth of the voice and breath,
if he is acquainted with the sacred utterances of the prophets he will
cease to wonder. That <span id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p18.2"></span>Solomon and
his father <span id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p18.3"></span>David were most
powerful kings, and also prophets, may perhaps be known even to those
who have not applied themselves to the sacred writings; the one of whom,
who reigned subsequently to the other, preceded the destruction of the
city of Troy by <span id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p18.4"></span>one hundred and
forty years. His father, the writer of sacred hymns, thus speaks in the
thirty-second Psalm: <span id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547) “By the
word of God were the heavens made firm; and all their power <span
id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548) by the breath of His mouth.” And also
again in the forty-fourth Psalm: <span id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549)
“My heart hath given utterance to a good word; I speak of my doings
towards the king;” testifying, in truth, that the works of God are known
to no other than to the Son alone, who is the Word of God, and who must
reign for ever. <span id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p21.3"></span>Solomon also
shows that it is the Word of God, and no other, <span
id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550) by whose hands these works of the
world were made. “I,” He says, “came forth out of the mouth of the Most
High before all creatures: I caused the light that faileth not to arise
in the heavens, and covered the whole earth with a cloud. I have dwelt
in the height, and my throne is in the pillar of the cloud.” <span
id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551) <span
id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p23.2"></span>John also thus taught: “In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and
without Him was not anything made.” <span
id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552)

that this prophecy refers to Christ; in its primary sense it refers to

<span id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p13"></span> There is great difficulty in
translating this passage, on account of the double sense of <span

including “<span id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p13.3"></span>spirit” and “breath.”
It is impossible to express the sense of the whole passage by either
word singly. There is the same difficulty with regard to <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p13.4"></span>πνευ̑μα</span>, as
in [Heb. i. 7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007)<span
id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p13.5"></span>: “He maketh His angels spirits,” more
correctly “winds.” See <span id="iii.ii.iv.viii-p13.6"></span>Delitzsch
