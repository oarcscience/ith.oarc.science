<p> <a name="iii.ii.viii.xli"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xli-p0.1"></A>Chap. XLV.&#8212;The Power and Works of Christ are Proved from the Scriptures.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xli-p1"></A>We have spoken of His nativity; now let us speak of His power and works, which, when He wrought them among men, the Jews, seeing them to be great and wonderful, supposed that they were done by the influence of magic, not knowing that all those things which were done by Him had been foretold by the prophets. He gave strength to the sick, and to those languishing under various diseases, not by any healing remedy, but instantaneously, by the force and power of His word; He restored the weak, He made the lame to walk, He gave sight to the blind, He made the dumb to speak, the deaf to hear; He cleansed the polluted and unclean, He restored their right mind to those who were maddened with the attack of demons, He recalled to life and light those who were dead or now buried. He also fed and satisfied&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1529"></A><A HREF="#fn_1529"><FONT SIZE="1">1530</FONT></A>
 five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes. He also walked upon the sea. He also in a tempest commanded the wind to be still, and immediately there was a calm; all which things we find predicted both in the books of the prophets and in the verses of the Sibyls. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xli-p3"></A>When a great multitude resorted to Him on account of these miracles, and, as He truly was, believed Him to be the Son of God, and sent from God, the priests and rulers of the Jews, filled with envy, and at the same time excited with anger, because He reproved their sins and injustice, conspired to put Him to death; and that this would happen, <a name="iii.ii.viii.xli-p3.1"></A>Solomon had foretold a little more than a thousand years before, in the book of Wisdom, using these words:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1530"></A><A HREF="#fn_1530"><FONT SIZE="1">1531</FONT></A>
 &#8220;Let us defraud the righteous, for he is unpleasant to us, and upbraideth us with our offences against the law. He maketh his boast that he has the knowledge of God, and he calleth himself the Son of God. He is made to reprove our thoughts: it grieveth us even to look upon him; for his life is not like the life of others, his ways are of another fashion. We are counted by him as triflers; he withdraweth himself from our ways, as from filthiness; he commendeth greatly the latter end of the just, and boasteth that he has God for his father. Let us see, therefore, if his words be true; let us prove what end he shall have; let us examine him with rebukes and torments, that we may know his meekness and prove his patience; let us condemn him to a shameful death. Such things have they imagined, and have gone astray; for their own folly hath blinded them, and they do not understand the mysteries of God.&#8221; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xli-p5"></A>Therefore, being unmindful of these writings which they read, they incited the people as though against an impious man, so that they seized and led Him to trial, and with impious words demanded His death. But they alleged against Him as a crime this very thing, that He said that He was the Son of God, and that by healing on the Sabbath He broke the law, which He said that He did not break, but fulfilled. And when <a name="iii.ii.viii.xli-p5.1"></A>Pontius Pilate, who then as legate had authority in Syria, perceived that the cause did not belong to the office of the Roman judge, he sent Him to <a name="iii.ii.viii.xli-p5.2"></A>Herod the Tetrarch, and permitted the Jews themselves to be the judges of their own law: who, having received the power of punishing His guilt, sentenced&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1531"></A><A HREF="#fn_1531"><FONT SIZE="1">1532</FONT></A>
 Him to the cross, but first scourged and struck him with their hands, put on Him a crown of thorns, spat upon His face, gave Him gall and vinegar to eat and drink; and amidst these things no word was heard to fall from His lips. Then the executioners, having cast lots over His tunic and mantle, suspended Him on the cross, and affixed Him to it, though on the next day they were about to celebrate the Passover, that is, their festival. Which crime was followed by prodigies, that they might understand the impiety which they had committed; for at the same moment in which He expired, there was a great earthquake, and a withdrawing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1532"></A><A HREF="#fn_1532"><FONT SIZE="1">1533</FONT></A>
 of the sun, so that the day was turned into night. &#160;</p>
