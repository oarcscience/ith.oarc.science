#### <span id="iii.v.lii-p0.1"></span>Chap. LII.

<span id="iii.v.lii-p1"></span>I relate all those things on the
authority of well-informed persons; and I thought it proper to commit
them to writing exactly as they happened, lest the memory of events so
important should perish, and lest any future historian of the
persecutors should corrupt the truth, either by suppressing their
offences against God, or the judgment of God against them. To His
everlasting mercy ought we to render thanks, that, having at length
looked on the earth, He deigned to collect again and to restore His
flock, partly laid waste by ravenous wolves, and partly scattered
abroad, and to extirpate those noxious wild beasts who had trod down its
pastures, and destroyed its resting-places. <span
id="fr_1997"></span>[1998](#fn_1997) Where now are <span
id="page_322">p. 322</span> <span id="iii.v.lii-Page_322"></span>the
surnames of the <span id="iii.v.lii-p2.3"></span>Jovii and the <span
id="iii.v.lii-p2.4"></span>Herculii, once so glorious and renowned
amongst the nations; surnames insolently assumed at first by <span
id="iii.v.lii-p2.5"></span>Diocles and <span
id="iii.v.lii-p2.6"></span>Maximian, and afterwards transferred to their
successors? The Lord has blotted them out and erased them from the
earth. Let us therefore with exultation celebrate the triumphs of God,
and oftentimes with praises make mention of His victory; let us in our
prayers, by night and by day, beseech Him to confirm for ever that peace
which, after a warfare of ten years, He has bestowed on His own: and do
you, above all others, my best beloved <span
id="iii.v.lii-p2.7"></span>Donatus, who so well deserve to be heard,
implore the Lord that it would please Him propitiously and mercifully to
continue His pity towards His servants, to protect His people from the
machinations and assaults of the devil, and to guard the now flourishing
churches in perpetual felicity.
