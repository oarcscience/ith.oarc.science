#### <span id="v.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Elucidation.

<span id="v.ii.i-p1"></span>(<span id="v.ii.i-p1.1"></span>Aviricius
Marcellus, p. 335, <span id="v.ii.i-p1.3"></span>supra)  

<span id="v.ii.i-p2"></span><span id="v.ii.i-p2.1"></span>Like his great
predecessor in Patristic research (Bishop<span id="v.ii.i-p2.2"></span>
Pearson), the learned and indefatigable Bishop <span
id="v.ii.i-p2.3"></span>Lightfoot will leave us gold-dust in the mere
sweepings of his literary work. His recent voluminous edition of the
<span id="v.ii.i-p2.4"></span>Apostolic Fathers <span
id="fr_2191"></span>[2192](#fn_2191) is encyclopedic in its treatment of
the subject; and I had hardly corrected the last proofs of the fragments
ascribed to <span id="v.ii.i-p3.1"></span>Asterius Urbanus when I
discovered, in one of his notes on <span
id="v.ii.i-p3.2"></span>Polycarp, a most brilliant elucidation of a
matter which I had supposed involved in twofold obscurity. <span
id="v.ii.i-p3.3"></span>Asterius is a mere name embedded in <span
id="v.ii.i-p3.4"></span>Eusebius, and in his fragments there preserved
is embedded the yet obscurer name of <span
id="v.ii.i-p3.5"></span>Aviricius Marcellus, which the reader will find,
with its various spellings, in one of the translator’s notes. <span
id="fr_2192"></span>[2193](#fn_2192) Who could have supposed that even
the learning and ingenuity of <span id="v.ii.i-p4.3"></span>Lightfoot
could fish out of very dark waters such shining booty as fills the
network about “<span id="v.ii.i-p4.4"></span>Abercius of Hierapolis?”
While he does not even name <span id="v.ii.i-p4.5"></span>Asterius, the
mere <span id="v.ii.i-p4.6"></span>nominis umbra of <span
id="v.ii.i-p4.7"></span>Aviricius Marcellus is material for a truly
remarkable dissertation covering nine pages of fine print, and enabling
us to conclude that this <span id="v.ii.i-p4.8"></span>Aviricius is none
other than the same “bishop of Hierapolis” about whom there is such a
long story in the Bollandist <span id="v.ii.i-p4.9"></span>Acta
Sanctorum  <span id="fr_2193"></span>[2194](#fn_2193) The story is a
silly legend, but <span id="v.ii.i-p5.4"></span>Lightfoot understands
the art <span class="Foreign"><span id="v.ii.i-p5.5"></span>ex fumo dare
lucem</span>; and any one who enjoys following up such elaborations will
find most curious and delightful reading in the pages to which I have
referred. Our <span id="v.ii.i-p5.6"></span>Aviricius, then, was bishop
of “Hierapolis of Lesser Phrygia,” not of Hierapolis on the Mæander, and
flourished about <span id="v.ii.i-p5.7"></span>a.d.163, during the reign
of <span id="v.ii.i-p5.8"></span>M. Aurelius. This date, therefore, must
correct the conjecture of <span id="v.ii.i-p5.9"></span>Tillemont and
the date which I had accepted from him on the authority of Dr. <span
id="v.ii.i-p5.10"></span>Lardner. <span
id="fr_2194"></span>[2195](#fn_2194)

<span id="v.ii.i-p6"></span> See p. 333, <span
id="v.ii.i-p6.2"></span>supra. “There is no clue to the authorship” of
the fragments, says the translator; but, under the lead of a <span
id="v.ii.i-p6.3"></span>Lightfoot, who may not hope to find one? I
commend the quarry to studious readers.
