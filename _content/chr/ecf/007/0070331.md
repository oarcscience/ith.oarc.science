<span id="iii.v.xxii-p1"></span>And now <span
id="iii.v.xxii-p1.1"></span>that cruelty, which he had learned in
torturing the Christians, became habitual, and he exercised it against
all men indiscriminately. <span id="fr_1981"></span>[1982](#fn_1981) He
was not wont to inflict the slighter sorts of punishment, as to banish,
to imprison, or to send criminals to work in the mines; but to burn, to
crucify, to expose to wild beasts, were things done daily, and without
hesitation. For smaller offences, those of his own household and his
stewards were chastised with lances, instead of rods; and, in great
offences, to be beheaded was an indulgence shown to very few; and it
seemed as a favour, on account of old services, when one was permitted
to die in the easiest manner. But these were slight evils in the
government of <span id="iii.v.xxii-p2.1"></span>Galerius, when compared
with what follows. For eloquence was extinguished, pleaders cut off, and
the learned in the laws either exiled or slain. Useful letters came to
be viewed in the same light as magical and forbidden arts; and all who
possessed them were trampled upon and execrated, as if they had been
hostile to government, and public enemies. Law was dissolved, and
unbounded licence permitted to judges,—to judges chosen from amongst the
soldiery, rude and illiterate men, and let loose upon the provinces,
without assessors to guide or control them.
