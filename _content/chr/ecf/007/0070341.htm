<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1"></A>Maximin <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.1"></A>Daia was incensed at the nomination of <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.2"></A>Licinius to the dignity of <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.3"></A>emperor</span>, and he would no longer be called <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.4"></A>C&aelig;sar</span>, or allow himself to be ranked as third in authority. <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.5"></A>Galerius, by repeated messages, besought <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.6"></A>Daia to yield, and to acquiesce in <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.7"></A>his</span> arrangement, to give place to age, and to reverence the grey hairs of <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.8"></A>Licinius. But <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.9"></A>Daia became more and more insolent. He urged that, as it was he who first assumed the purple, so, by possession, he had right to priority in rank; and he set at nought the entreaties and the injunctions of <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.10"></A>Galerius. That brute animal was stung to the quick, and bellowed when the mean creature whom he had made <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.11"></A>C&aelig;sar</span>, in expectation of his thorough obsequiousness, forgot the great favour conferred on him, and impiously withstood the requests and will of his benefactor. <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.12"></A>Galerius at length, overcome by the obstinacy of <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.13"></A>Daia, abolished the subordinate title of <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.14"></A>C&aelig;sar</span>, gave to himself and <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.15"></A>Licinius that of <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.16"></A>the Augusti</span>, and to <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.17"></A>Daia and <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.18"></A>Constantine that of <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.19"></A>sons of the Augusti</span>. <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.20"></A>Daia, some time after, in a letter to <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.21"></A>Galerius, took occasion to observe, that at the last general muster he had been saluted by his army under the title of <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.22"></A>Augustus</span>. <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.23"></A>Galerius, vexed and grieved at this, commanded that all the four should have the appellation of <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.24"></A>emperor</span>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1984"></A><A HREF="#fn_1984"><FONT SIZE="1">1985</FONT></A>
