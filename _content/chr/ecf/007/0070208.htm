<p> <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p0.1"></A>Chap. XX.&#8212;Of the Gods Peculiar to the Romans.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1"></A>I have spoken of the religious rites which are common to all nations. I will now speak of the gods which the Romans have peculiar to themselves. Who does not know that the wife of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.1"></A>Faustulus, the nurse of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.2"></A>Romulus and <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.3"></A>Remus, in honour of whom the Larentinalia were instituted, was a harlot? And for this reason she was called <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.4"></A>Lupa, and represented in the form of a wild beast. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.5"></A>Faula also and <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.6"></A>Flora were harlots, of whom the one was the mistress of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.7"></A>Hercules, as <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.8"></A>Verrius relates; the other, having acquired great wealth by her person, made the people her heir, and on this account the games called Floralia are celebrated in her honour. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p2"></A><a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p2.1"></A>Tatius consecrated the statue of a woman which had been found in the principal sewer, and called it by the name of the goddess <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p2.2"></A>Cloacina. The Romans, being besieged by the Gauls, made engines for throwing weapons of the hair of women; and on this account they erected an altar and temple to <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p2.3"></A>Venus Calva:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1467"></A><A HREF="#fn_1467"><FONT SIZE="1">1468</FONT></A>
 also to <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p3.2"></A>Jupiter Pistor,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1468"></A><A HREF="#fn_1468"><FONT SIZE="1">1469</FONT></A>
 because he had advised them in a dream to make all their corn into bread, and to throw it upon the enemy; and when this had been done, the Gauls, despairing of being able to reduce the Romans by famine, had abandoned the siege. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p4.2"></A>Tullus Hostilius made Fear and Pallor gods. Mind is also worshipped; but if they had possessed it, they would never, I believe, have thought that it ought to be worshipped. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p4.3"></A>Marcellus originated Honour and Virtue. &#160;</p>
