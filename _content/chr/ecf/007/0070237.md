#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xlv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XLIX.—That God is One Only.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xlv-p1"></span>If therefore the Jews have been
rejected by God, as the faith due to the sacred writings shows, and the
Gentiles, as we see, brought in, and freed from the darkness of this
present life and from the chains of demons, it follows that no other
hope is proposed to man, unless he shall follow true religion and true
wisdom, which is in Christ, and he who is ignorant of Him is always
estranged from the truth and from God. Nor let the Jews, or
philosophers, flatter themselves respecting the Supreme God. He who has
not acknowledged the Son has been unable to acknowledge the
Father. <span id="fr_1559"></span>[1560](#fn_1559) This is wisdom, and
this is the mystery of the Supreme God. God willed that He should be
acknowledged and worshipped through Him. <span
id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560) On this account He sent the
prophets beforehand to announce His coming, that when the things which
had been foretold were fulfilled in Him, then He might be believed by
men to be both the Son of God and God.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xlv-p4"></span>Nor, however, must the opinion be
entertained that there are two Gods, for the Father and the Son are one.
For since the Father loves the Son, and gives all things to Him, and the
Son faithfully obeys the Father, and wills nothing except that which the
Father does, it is plain that so close a relationship cannot be
separated, so that they should be said to be two in whom there is but
one substance, and will, and faith. Therefore the Son is through the
Father, and the Father through the Son. One honour is to be given to
both, as to one God, and is to be so divided through the worship of the
two, that the division itself may be bound by an inseparable bond of
union. He will leave nothing to himself, who separates either the Father
from the Son, or the Son from the Father. <span
