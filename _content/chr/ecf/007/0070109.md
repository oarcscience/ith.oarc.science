<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXVII.—Of the Wonders Effected by the Power of the Cross, and of Demons.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p1"></span>At present it is sufficient to show
what great efficacy the power of this sign has. How great a terror this
sign is to the demons, he will know who shall see how, when adjured by
Christ, they flee from the bodies which they have besieged. For as He
Himself, when He was living among men, put to flight all the demons by
His word, and restored to their former senses the minds of men which had
been excited and maddened by their dreadful attacks; so now His
followers, in the name of their Master, and by the sign of His passion,
banish the same polluted spirits from men. And it is not difficult to
prove this. For when they sacrifice to their gods, if any one bearing a
marked forehead stands by, the sacrifices are by no means
favourable. <span id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856)  

> <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p2.2"></span> “Nor can the diviner, when
> consulted, give answers.” <span id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857)  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p4"></span>And this has often been the cause
of punishment to wicked kings. For when some of their attendants who
were of our religion <span id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858) were
standing by their masters as they sacrificed, having the sign placed on
their foreheads, they caused the gods of their masters to flee, that
they might not be able to observe <span
id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859) future events in the entrails of the
victims. And when the soothsayers understood this, at the instigation of
the same <span id="page_130">p. 130</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-Page_130"></span>demons to whom they had
sacrificed, <span id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860) complaining that
profane men were present at the sacrifices, they drove their princes to
madness, so that they attacked the temple of the god, and contaminated
themselves by true sacrilege, which was expiated by the severest
punishments on the part of their persecutors. Nor, however, are blind
men able to understand even from this, either that this is the true
religion, which contains such great power for overcoming, or that that
is false, which is not able to hold its ground or to come to an
engagement.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p8"></span>But they say that the gods do this,
not through fear, but through hatred; as though it were possible for any
one to hate another, unless it be him who injures, or has the power of
injuring. Yea, truly, it would be consistent with their majesty to visit
those whom they hated with immediate punishment, <span
id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861) rather than to flee from them. But
since they can neither approach those in whom they shall see the
heavenly mark, nor injure those whom the immortal sign <span
id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862) as an impregnable wall protects, they
harass them by men, and persecute them by the hands of others: and if
they acknowledge the existence of these demons, we have overcome; for
this must necessarily be the true religion, which both understands the
nature of demons, and understands their subtlety, and compels them,
vanquished and subdued, to yield to itself. If they deny it, they will
be refuted by the testimonies of poets and philosophers. But if they do
not deny the existence and malignity of demons, what remains except that
they affirm that there is a difference between gods and demons? <span
id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863) Let them therefore explain to us the
difference between the two kinds, that we may know what is to be
worshipped and what to be held in execration; whether they have any
mutual agreement, or are really opposed to one another. If they are
united by some necessity, how shall we distinguish them? or how shall we
unite the honour and worship of each kind? If, on the other hand, they
are enemies, how is it that the demons do not fear the gods, or that the
gods cannot put to flight the demons? Behold, some one excited by the
impulse of the demon is out of his senses, raves, is mad: let us lead
him into the temple of the excellent and mighty <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p11.1"></span>Jupiter; or since <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p11.2"></span>Jupiter knows not how to cure men,
into the fane of <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p11.3"></span>Æsculapius or
<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p11.4"></span>Apollo. Let the priest of
either, in the name of his god, command the wicked spirit to come out of
the man: that can in no way come to pass. What, then, is the power of
the gods, if the demons are not subject to their control? But, in truth,
the same demons, when adjured by the name of the true God, immediately
flee. What reason is there why they should fear Christ, but not fear
<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p11.5"></span>Jupiter, unless that they whom
the multitude esteem to be gods are also demons? Lastly, if there should
be placed in the midst one who is evidently suffering from an attack of
a demon, and the priest of the <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p11.6"></span>Delphian Apollo, they will in the same
manner dread the name of God; and <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p11.7"></span>Apollo will as quickly depart from his
priest as the spirit of the demon from the man; and his god being
adjured and put to flight, the priest will be for ever silent. <span
id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864) Therefore the demons, whom they
acknowledge to be objects of execration, are the same as the gods to
whom they offer supplications.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p13"></span>If they imagine that we are
unworthy of belief, let them believe <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p13.1"></span>Homer, who associated the supreme
<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p13.2"></span>Jupiter <span
id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865) with the demons; and also other poets
and philosophers, who speak of the same beings at one time as demons,
and at another time as gods,—of which names one is true, and the other
false. For those most wicked spirits, when they are adjured, then
confess that they are demons; when they are worshipped, then falsely say
that they are gods; in order that they may lead men into errors, <span
id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866) and call them away from the knowledge
of the true God, by which alone eternal death can be escaped. They are
the same who, for the sake of overthrowing man, have founded various
systems of worship for themselves through different regions, <span
id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867) —under false and assumed names,
however, that they might deceive. For because they were unable by
themselves to aspire to divinity, they took to themselves the names of
powerful kings, under whose titles they might claim for themselves
divine honours; which error may be dispelled, and brought to the light
of truth. For if any one desires to inquire further into the matter, let
him assemble those who are skilled in calling forth spirits from the
dead. Let them call forth <span id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868) <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p17.1"></span>Jupiter, <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p17.2"></span>Neptune, <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p17.3"></span>Vulcan, <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p17.4"></span>Mercury, <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p17.5"></span>Apollo, and <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p17.6"></span>Saturnus the father of all. All will
answer from the lower regions; and being questioned they will speak, and
confess respecting themselves and <span id="page_131">p. 131</span>
<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-Page_131"></span>God. After these things let
them call up Christ; He will not be present, He will not appear, for He
was not more than two days in the lower regions. What proof can be
brought forward more certain than this? I have no doubt that <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p17.7"></span>Trismegistus arrived at the truth by
some proof of this kind, who spoke many things <span
id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869) respecting God the Son which are
contained in the divine secrets.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxvii-p10"></span> i.e., the sign of the cross, with
which the early Christians frequently marked themselves. \[So long as
Christians were mocked and despised as followers of a crucified one,
there was a silent testimony and bold confession in this act which must
be wholly separated from the mere superstition of degenerate Christians.
