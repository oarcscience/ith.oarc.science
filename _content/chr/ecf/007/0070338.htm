<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xxix-p1"></A>Then <a name="iii.v.xxix-p1.1"></A>Maximian returned into Gaul; and after having made some stay in those quarters, he went to <a name="iii.v.xxix-p1.2"></A>Galerius, the enemy of his son, that they might confer together, as he pretended, about the settlement of the commonweal; but his true purpose was, under colour of reconciliation, to find an opportunity of murdering <a name="iii.v.xxix-p1.3"></A>Galerius, and of seizing his share of the empire, instead of his own, from which he had been everywhere excluded.  &#160;</p>

So it was performed in presence both of him and of <a name="iii.v.xxix-p2.8"></A>Maximian; and thus there were six who ruled the empire at one and the same time.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1983"></A><A HREF="#fn_1983"><FONT SIZE="1">1984</FONT></A>

<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xxix-p4"></A>Now the designs of <a name="iii.v.xxix-p4.1"></A>Maximian having been frustrated, he took flight, as he had done twice before, and returned into Gaul, with a heart full of wickedness, and intending by treacherous devices to overreach <a name="iii.v.xxix-p4.2"></A>Constantine, who was not only his own son-in-law, but also the child of his son-in-law; and that he might the more successfully deceive, he laid aside the imperial purple. The Franks had taken up arms. <a name="iii.v.xxix-p4.3"></A>Maximian advised the unsuspecting <a name="iii.v.xxix-p4.4"></A>Constantine not to lead all his troops against them, and he said that a few soldiers would suffice to subdue those barbarians. He gave this advice that an army might be left for him to win over to himself, and that <a name="iii.v.xxix-p4.5"></A>Constantine, by reason of his scanty forces, might be overpowered. The young prince believed the advice to be judicious, because given by an aged and experienced commander; and he followed it, because given by a father-in-law. He marched, leaving the most considerable part of his forces behind. <a name="iii.v.xxix-p4.6"></A>Maximian waited a few days; and as soon as, by his calculation, <a name="iii.v.xxix-p4.7"></A>Constantine had entered the territory of the barbarians, he suddenly resumed the imperial purple, seized the public treasures, after his wont made ample donatives to the soldiery, and feigned that such disasters had befallen <a name="iii.v.xxix-p4.8"></A>Constantine as soon after befell himself. <a name="iii.v.xxix-p4.9"></A>Constantine was presently informed of those events, and, by marches astonishingly rapid, he flew back with his army. <a name="iii.v.xxix-p4.10"></A>Maximian, not yet prepared to oppose him, was overpowered at unawares, and the soldiers returned to their duty. <a name="iii.v.xxix-p4.11"></A>Maximian had possessed himself of Marseilles (he fled thither), and shut the gates. <a name="iii.v.xxix-p4.12"></A>Constantine drew nigh, and seeing <a name="iii.v.xxix-p4.13"></A>Maximian on the walls, addressed him in no harsh or hostile language, and demanded what he meant, and what it was that he wanted, and why he had acted in a way so peculiarly unbecoming him. But <a name="iii.v.xxix-p4.14"></A>Maximian from the walls incessantly uttered abuse and curses against <a name="iii.v.xxix-p4.15"></A>Constantine. Then, of a sudden, the gates on the opposite side having been unbarred, the besiegers were admitted into the city. The rebel emperor, and unnatural parent and a perfidious father-in-law, was dragged into the presence of <a name="iii.v.xxix-p4.16"></A>Constantine, heard a recital made of his crimes, was divested of his imperial robe, and, after this reprimand, obtained his life. &#160;</p>
