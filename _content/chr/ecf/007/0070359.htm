<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.l-p1"></A>Thus did God subdue all those who persecuted His name, so that neither root nor branch of them remained; for <a name="iii.v.l-p1.1"></A>Licinius, as soon as he was established in sovereign authority, commanded that <a name="iii.v.l-p1.2"></A>Valeria should be put to death. <a name="iii.v.l-p1.3"></A>Daia, although exasperated against her, never ventured to do this, not even after his discomfiture and flight, and when he knew that his end approached. <a name="iii.v.l-p1.4"></A>Licinius commanded that <a name="iii.v.l-p1.5"></A>Candidianus also should be put to death. He was the son of <a name="iii.v.l-p1.6"></A>Galerius by a concubine, and <a name="iii.v.l-p1.7"></A>Valeria, having no children, had adopted him. On the news of the death of <a name="iii.v.l-p1.8"></A>Daia, she came in disguise to the court of <a name="iii.v.l-p1.9"></A>Licinius, anxious to observe what might befall <a name="iii.v.l-p1.10"></A>Candidianus. The youth, presenting himself at Nicomedia, had an outward show of honour paid to him, and, while he suspected no harm, was killed. Hearing of this catastrophe, <a name="iii.v.l-p1.11"></A>Valeria immediately fled. The Emperor <a name="iii.v.l-p1.12"></A>Severus left a son, <a name="iii.v.l-p1.13"></A>Severianus, arrived at man&#146;s estate, who accompanied <a name="iii.v.l-p1.14"></A>Daia in his flight from the field of battle. <a name="iii.v.l-p1.15"></A>Licinius caused him to be condemned and executed, under the pretence that, on the death of <a name="iii.v.l-p1.16"></A>Daia, he had intentions of assuming the imperial purple. Long before this time, <a name="iii.v.l-p1.17"></A>Candidianus and <a name="iii.v.l-p1.18"></A>Severianus, apprehending evil from <a name="iii.v.l-p1.19"></A>Licinius, had chosen to remain with <a name="iii.v.l-p1.20"></A>Daia; while <a name="iii.v.l-p1.21"></A>Valeria favoured <a name="iii.v.l-p1.22"></A>Licinius, and was willing to bestow on him that which she had denied to <a name="iii.v.l-p1.23"></A>Daia, all rights accruing to her as the widow of <a name="iii.v.l-p1.24"></A>Galerius. <a name="iii.v.l-p1.25"></A>Licinius also put to death <a name="iii.v.l-p1.26"></A>Maximus, the son of <a name="iii.v.l-p1.27"></A>Daia, a boy eight years old, and a daughter of <a name="iii.v.l-p1.28"></A>Daia, who was seven years old, and had been betrothed to <a name="iii.v.l-p1.29"></A>Candidianus. But before their death, their mother had been thrown into the Orontes, in which river she herself had frequently commanded chaste women to be drowned. So, by the unerring and just judgment of God, all the impious received according to the deeds that they had done. &#160;</p>
