<p> <a name="iii.v.xxiv"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.v.xxiv-p0.1"></A>Chap. XXIV.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1"></A>Already the judgment of God approached him, and that season ensued in which his fortunes began to droop and to waste away. While occupied in the manner that I have described above, he did not set himself to subvert or expel <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.1"></A>Constantius, but waited for his death, not imagining, however, that it was so nigh. <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.2"></A>Constantius, having become exceedingly ill, wrote to <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.3"></A>Galerius, and requested that his son <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.4"></A>Constantine might be sent to see him. He had made a like request long before, but in vain; for <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.5"></A>Galerius meant nothing less than to grant it. On the contrary, he laid repeated snares for the life of that young man, because he durst not use open violence, lest he should stir up civil wars against himself, and incur that which he most dreaded, the hate <A NAME="page_311"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 311</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.xxiv-Page_311"></A>and resentment of the army. Under pretence of manly exercise and recreation, he made him combat with wild beasts: but this device was frustrated; for the power of God protected <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.6"></A>Constantine, and in the very moment of jeopardy rescued him from the hands of <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.7"></A>Galerius. At length, <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.8"></A>Galerius, when he could no longer avoid complying with the request of <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.9"></A>Constantius, one evening gave <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.10"></A>Constantine a warrant to depart, and commanded him to set out next morning with the imperial despatches. <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.11"></A>Galerius meant either to find some pretext for detaining <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.12"></A>Constantine, or to forward orders to <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.13"></A>Severus for arresting him on the road. <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.14"></A>Constantine discerned his purpose; and therefore, after supper, when the emperor was gone to rest, he hasted away, carried off from the principal stages all the horses maintained at the public expense, and escaped. Next day the emperor, having purposely remained in his bed-chamber until noon, ordered <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.15"></A>Constantine to be called into his presence; but he learnt that <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.16"></A>Constantine had set out immediately after supper. Outrageous with passion, he ordered horses to be made ready, that <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.17"></A>Constantine might be pursued and dragged back; and hearing that all the horses had been carried off from the great road, he could hardly refrain from tears. Meanwhile <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.18"></A>Constantine, journeying with incredible rapidity, reached his father, who was already about to expire. <a name="iii.v.xxiv-p1.19"></A>Constantius recommended his son to the soldiers, delivered the sovereign authority into his hands, and then died, as his wish had long been, in peace and quiet. &#160;</p>
