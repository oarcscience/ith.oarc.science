<p> <a name="iii.ii.iii.xx"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xx-p0.1"></A>Chap. XX.&#8212;Socrates Had More Knowledge in Philosophy Than Other Men, Although in Many Things He Acted Foolishly.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xx-p1"></A>Let us now see what there was so great in <a name="iii.ii.iii.xx-p1.1"></A>Socrates himself, that a wise man deservedly gave thanks that he was born in his times. I do not deny that he was a little more sagacious than the others who thought that the nature of things could be comprehended by the mind. And in this I judge that they were not only senseless, but also impious; because they wished to send their inquisitive eyes into the secrets of that heavenly providence. We know that there are at Rome, and in many cities, certain sacred things which it is considered impious for men to look upon. Therefore they who are not permitted to pollute those objects abstain from looking upon them; and if by error or some accident a man has happened to see them, his guilt is expiated first by his punishment, and afterwards by a repetition of sacrifice. What can you do in the case of those who wish to pry into unpermitted things? Truly they are much more wicked who seek to profane the secrets of the world and this heavenly temple with impious disputations, than those who entered the temple of <a name="iii.ii.iii.xx-p1.2"></A>Vesta, or the Good Goddess, or <a name="iii.ii.iii.xx-p1.3"></A>Ceres. And these shrines, though it is not lawful for men to approach them, were yet constructed by men. But these men not only escape the charge of impiety, but, that which is much more unbecoming, they gain the fame of eloquence and the glory of talent. What if they were able to investigate anything? For they are as foolish in asserting as they are wicked in searching out; since they are neither able to find out anything, nor, even if they had found out anything, to defend it. For if even by chance they have seen the truth&#8212;a thing which often happens&#8212;they so act that it is refuted by others as false. For no one descends from heaven to pass sentence on the opinions of individuals; wherefore no one can doubt that those who seek after these things are foolish, senseless, and insane. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xx-p2"></A><a name="iii.ii.iii.xx-p2.1"></A>Socrates therefore had something of human wisdom,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_455"></A><A HREF="#fn_455"><FONT SIZE="1">456</FONT></A>
 who, when he understood that these things could not possibly be ascertained, removed himself from questions of this kind; but I fear that he so acted in this alone. For many of his actions are not only undeserving of praise, but also most deserving of censure, in which things he most resembled those of his own class. Out of these I will select one which may be judged of by all. <a name="iii.ii.iii.xx-p3.3"></A>Socrates used this well-known proverb: &#8220;That which is above us is nothing to us.&#8221; Let us therefore fall down upon the earth, and use as feet those hands which have been given us for the production of excellent works. The heaven is nothing to us, to the contemplation of which we have been raised;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_456"></A><A HREF="#fn_456"><FONT SIZE="1">457</FONT></A>
 in fine, the light itself can have no reference to us; undoubtedly the cause of our sustenance is from heaven. But if he perceived this, that we ought not to discuss the nature of heavenly things, he was unable even to comprehend the nature of those things which he had beneath his feet. What then? did he err in his words? It is not probable; but he undoubtedly meant that which he said, that we are not to devote ourselves to religion; but if he were openly to say this, no one would suffer it. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xx-p5"></A>For who cannot perceive that this world, completed with such wonderful method, is governed by some providence, since there is nothing which can exist without some one to direct it? Thus, a house deserted by its inhabitant fails to decay; a ship without a pilot goes to the bottom; and a body abandoned by the soul wastes away. Much less can we suppose that so great a fabric could either have been constructed without an <A NAME="page_92"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 92</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.iii.xx-Page_92"></A>Artificer, or have existed so long without a Ruler. But if he wished to overthrow those public superstitions, I do not disapprove of this; yea, I shall rather praise it, if he shall have found anything better <span><a name="iii.ii.iii.xx-p5.1"></A>to take their place</span>. But the same man swore&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_457"></A><A HREF="#fn_457"><FONT SIZE="1">458</FONT></A>
 by a dog and a goose. Oh buffoon (as <a name="iii.ii.iii.xx-p6.4"></A>Zeno the Epicurean&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_458"></A><A HREF="#fn_458"><FONT SIZE="1">459</FONT></A>
 says), senseless, abandoned, desperate man, if he wished to scoff at religion; madman, if he did this seriously, so as to esteem a most base animal as God! For who can dare to find fault with the superstitions of the Egyptians, when <a name="iii.ii.iii.xx-p7.3"></A>Socrates confirmed them at Athens by his authority? But was it not a mark of consummate vanity, that before his death he asked his friends to sacrifice for him a cock which he had vowed to <a name="iii.ii.iii.xx-p7.4"></A>&AElig;sculapius? He evidently feared lest he should be put upon his trial before <a name="iii.ii.iii.xx-p7.5"></A>Rhadamanthus, the judge, by <a name="iii.ii.iii.xx-p7.6"></A>&AElig;sculapius on account of the vow. I should consider him most mad if he had died under the influence of disease. But since he did this in his sound mind, he who thinks that he was wise is himself of unsound mind. Behold one in whose times the wise man congratulates himself as having been born! &#160;</p>
