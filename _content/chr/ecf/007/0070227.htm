<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p1"></A>These things, truly, are of small importance, but they arise from the same falsehood. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p1.1"></A>Xenophanes said that the orb of the moon is eighteen times larger than this earth of ours; and that within its compass is contained another earth, which is inhabited by men and animals of every kind. About the antipodes also one can neither hear nor speak without laughter. It is asserted as something serious, that we should believe that there are men who have their feet opposite to ours. The ravings of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p1.2"></A>Anaxagoras are more tolerable, who said that snow was black. And not only the sayings, but the deeds, of some are ridiculous. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p1.3"></A>Democritus neglected his land which was left to him by his father, and suffered it to become a public pasture. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p1.4"></A>Diogenes with his company of dogs,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1506"></A><A HREF="#fn_1506"><FONT SIZE="1">1507</FONT></A>
 who professes that great and perfect virtue in the contempt of all things, preferred to beg for his support, rather than to seek it by honest labour, or to have any property. Undoubtedly the life of a wise man ought to be to others an example of living. If all should imitate the wisdom of these, how will states exist? But perhaps the same Cynics were able to afford an example of modesty, who lived with their wives in public. I know not how they could defend virtue, who took away modesty. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3"></A>Nor was <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3.1"></A>Aristippus better than these, who, I believe, that he might please his mistress <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3.2"></A>Lais, instituted the Cyrenaic system, by which he placed the end of the chief good in bodily pleasure, that authority might not be wanting to his faults, or learning to his vices. Are those men of greater fortitude to be more approved, who, that they might be said to have despised death, died by their own hands? <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3.3"></A>Zeno, <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3.4"></A>Empedocles, <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3.5"></A>Chrysippus, <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3.6"></A>Cleanthes, <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3.7"></A>Democritus, and <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3.8"></A>Cato, imitating these, did not know that he who put himself to death is guilty of murder, according to the divine right and law. For it was God who placed us in this abode of flesh: it was He who gave us the temporary habitation of the body, that we should inhabit it as long as He pleased. Therefore it is to be considered impious, to wish to depart from it without the command of God. Therefore violence must not be applied to nature. He knows how to destroy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1507"></A><A HREF="#fn_1507"><FONT SIZE="1">1508</FONT></A>
 His own work. And if any one shall apply impious hands to that work, and shall tear asunder the bonds of the divine workmanship, he endeavours to flee from God, whose sentence no one will be able to escape, whether alive or dead. Therefore they are accursed and impious, whom I have mentioned above, who even taught what are the befitting reasons for voluntary death; so that it was not enough of guilt that they were self-murderers, unless they instructed others also to this wickedness.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1508"></A><A HREF="#fn_1508"><FONT SIZE="1">1509</FONT></A>
