<p> <a name="iii.ii.iv.v"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.iv.v-p0.1"></A>Chap. V.&#8212;The Oracles of the Prophets Must Be Looked Into; And of Their Times, and the Times of the Judges and Kings.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iv.v-p1"></A>Now, since I have shown that wisdom and religion cannot be separated, it remains that we speak of religion itself, and wisdom. I am aware, indeed, how difficult it is to discuss heavenly subjects; but still the attempt must be ventured, that the truth may be made clear and brought to light, and that many may be freed from error and death, who despise and refuse the truth, while it is concealed under a covering of folly. But before I begin to speak of God and His works, I must first speak a few things concerning the prophets, whose testimony I must now use, which I have refrained from doing in the former books. Above all things, he who desires to comprehend the truth ought not only to apply his mind to understand the utterances of the prophets, but also most diligently to inquire into the times during which each one of them existed, that he may know what future events they predicted, and after how many years their predictions were fulfilled.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_515"></A><A HREF="#fn_515"><FONT SIZE="1">516</FONT></A>
 Nor is there any difficulty in making these computations; for they testified under what king each of them received the inspiration of the Divine Spirit. And many have written and published books respecting the times, making their commencement from the prophet <a name="iii.ii.iv.v-p2.4"></A>Moses, who lived about seven hundred years before the Trojan war. But he, when he had governed the people for forty years, was succeeded by <a name="iii.ii.iv.v-p2.5"></A>Joshua, who held the chief place twenty-seven years. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iv.v-p3"></A>After this they were under the government of judges during <span><a name="iii.ii.iv.v-p3.1"></A>three hundred and seventy</span> years. <A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.iv.v-Page_105"></A>Then their condition was changed, and they began to have kings; and when they had ruled during<span><a name="iii.ii.iv.v-p3.2"></A> four hundred and fifty years</span>, until the reign of <a name="iii.ii.iv.v-p3.3"></A>Zedekiah, the Jews having been besieged by the king of Babylon, and carried into captivity,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_516"></A><A HREF="#fn_516"><FONT SIZE="1">517</FONT></A>
 endured a long servitude, until, in the seventieth year afterwards, the captive Jews were restored to their own lands and settlements by <a name="iii.ii.iv.v-p4.3"></A>Cyrus the elder, who attained the supreme power over the Persians, at the time when <a name="iii.ii.iv.v-p4.4"></A>Tarquinius Superbus reigned at Rome. Wherefore, since the whole series of times may be collected both from the Jewish histories and from those of the Greeks and Romans, the times of the prophets individually may also be collected; the last of whom was <a name="iii.ii.iv.v-p4.5"></A>Zechariah, and it is agreed on that he prophesied in the time of King <a name="iii.ii.iv.v-p4.6"></A>Darius, in the second year of his reign, and in the eighth month. Of so much greater antiquity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_517"></A><A HREF="#fn_517"><FONT SIZE="1">518</FONT></A>
 are the prophets found to be than the Greek writers. And I bring forward all these things, that they may perceive their error who endeavour to refute Holy Scripture, as though it were new and recently composed, being ignorant from what fountain the origin of our holy religion flowed. But if any one, having put together and examined the times, shall duly lay the foundation of learning, and fully ascertain the truth, he will also lay aside his error when he has gained the knowledge of the truth. &#160;</p>
