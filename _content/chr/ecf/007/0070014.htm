<p> <a name="iii.ii.i.ix"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.i.ix-p0.1"></A>Chap. viii.&#8212;that god is without a body, nor does he need difference of sex for procreation.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.ix-p1"></A>It is proved, therefore, by these witnesses, so numerous and of such authority, that the universe <A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.i.ix-Page_18"></A>is governed by the power and providence of one God, whose energy and majesty <a name="iii.ii.i.ix-p1.1"></A>Plato in the <a name="iii.ii.i.ix-p1.2"></A>Tim&aelig;us asserts to be so great, that no one can either conceive it in his mind, or give utterance to it in words, on account of His surpassing and incalculable power. And then can any one doubt whether any thing can be difficult or impossible for God, who by His providence designed, by His energy established, and by His judgment completed those works so great and wonderful, and even now sustains them by His spirit, and governs them by His power, being incomprehensible and unspeakable, and fully known to no other than Himself? Wherefore, as I often reflect on the subject of such great majesty, they who worship the gods sometimes appear so blind, so incapable of reflection, so senseless, so little removed from the mute animals, as to believe that those who are born from the natural intercourse of the sexes could have had anything of majesty and divine influence; since the <a name="iii.ii.i.ix-p1.3"></A>Erythr&aelig;an Sibyl says: &#8220;It is impossible for a God to be fashioned from the loins of a man and the womb<span><a name="iii.ii.i.ix-p1.4"></A> of a woman</span>.&#8221; And if this is true, as it really is, it is evident that <a name="iii.ii.i.ix-p1.5"></A>Hercules, <a name="iii.ii.i.ix-p1.6"></A>Apollo, <a name="iii.ii.i.ix-p1.7"></A>Bacchus, <a name="iii.ii.i.ix-p1.8"></A>Mercury, and <a name="iii.ii.i.ix-p1.9"></A>Jupiter, with the rest, were but men, since they were born from the two sexes. But what is so far removed from the nature of God as that operation which He Himself assigned to mortals for the propagation of their race, and which cannot be affected without corporeal substance? &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.ix-p2"></A>Therefore, if the gods are immortal and eternal, what need is there of the other sex, when they themselves do not require succession, since they are always about to exist? For assuredly in the case of mankind and the other animals, there is no other reason for difference of sex and procreation and bringing forth, except that all classes of living creatures, inasmuch as they are doomed to death by the condition of their mortality, may be preserved by mutual succession. But God, who is immortal, has no need of difference of sex, nor of succession. Some one will say <span><a name="iii.ii.i.ix-p2.1"></A>that this arrangement is necessary</span>, in order that He may have some to minister to Him, or over whom He may bear rule. What need is there of the female sex, since God, who is almighty, is able to produce sons without the agency of the female? For if He has granted to certain minute creatures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">44</FONT></A>
 that they &#160;</p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.i.ix-p3.3"></A>   &#8220;Should gather offspring for themselves with their mouth from leaves and sweet herbs,&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>  
<p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.i.ix-p4"></A>why should any one think it impossible for God Himself to have offspring except by union with the other sex? No one, therefore, is so thoughtless as not to understand that those were mere mortals, whom the ignorant and foolish regard and worship as gods. Why, then, some one will say, were they believed to be gods? Doubtless because they were very great and powerful kings; and since, on account of the merits of their virtues, or offices, or the arts which they discovered, they were beloved by those over whom they had ruled, they were consecrated to <span><a name="iii.ii.i.ix-p4.1"></A>lasting</span> memory. And if any one doubts this, let him consider their exploits and deeds, the whole of which both ancient poets and historians have handed down. &#160;</p>
