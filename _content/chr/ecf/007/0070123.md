#### <span id="iii.ii.v.x-p0.1"></span>Chap. X.—Of False Piety, and of False and True Religion.

<span id="iii.ii.v.x-p1"></span>It is worth while to investigate their
piety, that from their merciful and pious actions it may be understood
what is the character of those things which are done by them contrary to
the laws of piety. And that I may not seem to attack any one with
harshness, I will take a character from the poets, and one which is the
greatest example of piety. In <span id="iii.ii.v.x-p1.1"></span>Maro,
that king  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.x-p1.2"></span> “Than who  
> The breath of being none e’er drew,  
> More brave, more pious, or more true,” <span
> id="fr_994"></span>[995](#fn_994) —  

<span id="iii.ii.v.x-p3"></span>what proofs of justice did he bring
forward to us?  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.x-p3.1"></span> “There walk with hands fast bound
> behind  
> The victim prisoners, designed  
> For slaughter o’er the flames.” <span
> id="fr_995"></span>[996](#fn_995)  

<span id="iii.ii.v.x-p5"></span>What can be more merciful than this
piety? <span id="iii.ii.v.x-p5.1"></span>what more merciful than to
immolate human victims to the dead, and to feed the fire with the blood
of men as with oil? But perhaps this may not have been the fault of the
hero himself, but of the poet, who polluted with distinguished
wickedness “a man distinguished by his piety.” <span
id="fr_996"></span>[997](#fn_996) Where then, O poet, is that piety
which you so frequently praise? Behold the pious <span
id="iii.ii.v.x-p6.2"></span>Æneas:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.x-p6.3"></span> “Four hapless youths of <span
> id="iii.ii.v.x-p6.5"></span>Sulmo’s breed,  
> And four who <span id="iii.ii.v.x-p6.7"></span>Ufens call their
> sire,  
> He takes alive, condemned to bleed  
> To <span id="iii.ii.v.x-p6.10"></span>Pallas’ shade on Pallas’
> pyre.” <span id="fr_997"></span>[998](#fn_997)  

<span id="iii.ii.v.x-p8"></span>Why, therefore, at the very same time
when he was sending the men in chains to slaughter, did he say,  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.x-p8.1"></span> “Fain would I grant the living
> peace,” <span id="fr_998"></span>[999](#fn_998)  

<span id="iii.ii.v.x-p10"></span>when he ordered that those whom he had
in his power alive should be slain in the place of cattle? But this, as
I have said, was not his fault—for <span id="page_146">p. 146</span>
<span id="iii.ii.v.x-Page_146"></span>he perhaps had not received a
liberal education—but yours; for, though you were learned, yet you were
ignorant of the nature of piety, and you believed that that wicked and
detestable action of his was the befitting exercise of piety. He is
plainly called pious on this account only, because he loved his father.
Why should I say that  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.x-p10.1"></span> “The good <span
> id="iii.ii.v.x-p10.3"></span>Æneas owned their plea,” <span
> id="fr_999"></span>[1000](#fn_999)  

<span id="iii.ii.v.x-p12"></span>and yet slew them? For, though adjured
by the same father, and  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.x-p12.1"></span> “By young <span
> id="iii.ii.v.x-p12.3"></span>Iulus’ dawning day,” <span
> id="fr_1000"></span>[1001](#fn_1000)  

<span id="iii.ii.v.x-p14"></span>he did not spare them,  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.x-p14.1"></span> “Live fury kindling every
> vein” <span id="fr_1001"></span>[1002](#fn_1001)  

<span id="iii.ii.v.x-p16"></span>What! can any one imagine that there
was any virtue in him who was fired with madness as stubble, and,
forgetful of the shade of his father, by whom he was entreated, was
unable to curb his wrath? He was therefore by no means pious who not
only slew the unresisting, but even suppliants. Here some one will say:
What then, or where, or of what character is piety? Truly it is among
those who are ignorant of wars, who maintain concord with all, who are
friendly even to their enemies, who love all men as brethren, who know
how to restrain their anger, and to soothe every passion of the mind
with calm government. How great a mist, therefore, how great a cloud of
darkness and errors, has over-spread the breasts of men who, when they
think themselves especially pious, then become especially impious? For
the more religiously they honour those earthy images, so much the more
wicked are they towards the name of the true divinity. And therefore
they are often harassed with greater evils as the reward of their
impiety; and because they know not the cause of these evils, the blame
is altogether ascribed to fortune, and the philosophy of <span
id="iii.ii.v.x-p16.1"></span>Epicurus finds a place, who thinks that
nothing extends to the gods, and that they are neither influenced by
favour nor moved by anger, because they often see their despisers happy,
and their worshippers in misery. And this happens on this account,
because when they seem to be religious and naturally good, they are
believed to deserve nothing of that kind which they often suffer.
However, they console themselves by accusing fortune; nor do they
perceive that if she had any existence, she would never injure her
worshippers. Piety of this kind is therefore deservedly followed by
punishment; and the deity offended with the wickedness of men who are
depraved in their religious worship, <span
id="fr_1002"></span>[1003](#fn_1002) punishes them with heavy
misfortune; who, although they live with holiness in the greatest faith
and innocence, yet because they worship gods whose impious and profane
rites are an abomination to the true God, are estranged from justice and
the name of true piety. Nor is it difficult to show why the worshippers
of the gods cannot be good and just. For how shall they abstain from the
shedding of blood who worship bloodthirsty deities, <span
id="iii.ii.v.x-p17.2"></span>Mars and <span
id="iii.ii.v.x-p17.3"></span>Bellona? or how shall they spare their
parents who worship <span id="iii.ii.v.x-p17.4"></span>Jupiter, who
drove out his father? or how shall they spare their own infants who
worship <span id="iii.ii.v.x-p17.5"></span>Saturnus? how shall they
uphold chastity who worship a goddess who is naked, and an adulteress,
and who prostitutes herself as it were among the gods? how shall they
withhold themselves from plunder and frauds who are acquainted with the
thefts of <span id="iii.ii.v.x-p17.6"></span>Mercurius, who teaches that
to deceive is not the part of fraud, but of cleverness? how shall they
restrain their lusts who worship <span
id="iii.ii.v.x-p17.7"></span>Jupiter, <span
id="iii.ii.v.x-p17.8"></span>Hercules, <span
id="iii.ii.v.x-p17.9"></span>Liber, <span
id="iii.ii.v.x-p17.10"></span>Apollo, and the others, whose adulteries
and debaucheries with men and women are not only known to the learned,
but are even set forth in the theatres, and made the subject of songs,
so that they are notorious <span id="fr_1003"></span>[1004](#fn_1003) to
all? Among these things is it possible for men to be just, who, although
they were naturally good, would be trained to injustice by the very gods
themselves? For, that you may propitiate the god whom you worship, there
is need of those things with which you know that he is pleased and
delighted. Thus it comes to pass that the god fashions the life of his
worshippers according to the character of his own will, <span
id="fr_1004"></span>[1005](#fn_1004) since the most religious worship is
to imitate.
