#### <span id="iii.ii.ii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIX.—Of the Worship of Images and Earthly Objects.

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xix-p1"></span>Whoever, therefore, is anxious to
observe the obligations to which man is liable, and to maintain a regard
for his nature, let him raise himself from the ground, and, with mind
lifted up, let him direct his eyes to heaven: let him not seek God under
his feet, nor dig up from his footprints an object of veneration, for
whatever lies beneath man must necessarily be inferior to man; but let
him seek it aloft, let him seek it in the highest place: for nothing can
be greater than man, except that which is above man. But God is greater
than man: therefore He is above, and <span id="page_68">p. 68</span>
<span id="iii.ii.ii.xix-Page_68"></span>not below; nor is He to be
sought in the lowest, but rather in the highest region. Wherefore it is
undoubted that there is no religion wherever there is an image. <span
id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357) For if religion consists of divine
things, and there is nothing divine except in heavenly things; it
follows that images are without religion, because there can be nothing
heavenly in that which is made from the earth. And this, indeed, may be
plain to a wise man from the very name. <span
id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358) For whatever is an imitation, that
must of necessity be false; nor can anything receive the name of a true
object which counterfeits the truth by deception and imitation. But if
all imitation is not particularly a serious matter, but as it were a
sport and jest, then there is no religion in images, but a mimicry of
religion. That which is true is therefore to be preferred to all things
which are false; earthly things are to be trampled upon, that we may
obtain heavenly things. For this is the state of the case, that
whosoever shall prostrate his soul, which has its origin from heaven, to
the shades <span id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359) beneath, and the
lowest things, must fall to that place to which he has cast himself.
Therefore he ought to be mindful of his nature and condition, and always
to strive and aim at things above. And whoever shall do this, he will be
judged altogether wise, he just, he a man: he, in short, will be judged
worthy of heaven whom his Parent will recognise not as abject, nor cast
down to the earth after the manner of the beasts, <span
id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360) but rather standing and upright as He
made him.
