<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xxx-p1"></A><a name="iii.v.xxx-p1.1"></A>Maximian, having thus forfeited the respect due to an emperor and a father-in-law, grew impatient at his abased condition, and, emboldened by impunity, formed new plots against <a name="iii.v.xxx-p1.2"></A>Constantine. He addressed himself to his daughter <a name="iii.v.xxx-p1.3"></A>Fausta, and, as well by entreaties as by the soothing of flattery, solicited her to betray her husband. He promised to obtain for her a more honourable alliance than that with <a name="iii.v.xxx-p1.4"></A>Constantine; and he requested her to allow the bed-chamber of the emperor to be left open, and to be slightly guarded. <a name="iii.v.xxx-p1.5"></A>Fausta undertook to do whatever he asked, and instantly revealed the whole to her husband. A plan was laid for detecting <a name="iii.v.xxx-p1.6"></A>Maximian in the very execution of his crime. They placed a base eunuch to be murdered instead of the emperor. At the dead of night <a name="iii.v.xxx-p1.7"></A>Maximian arose, and perceived all things to be favourable for his insidious purpose. There were few soldiers on guard, and these too at some distance from the bed-chamber. However, to prevent suspicion, he accosted them, and said that he had had a dream which he wished to communicate to his son-in-law. He went in armed, slew the eunuch, sprung forth exultingly, and avowed the murder. At that moment <a name="iii.v.xxx-p1.8"></A>Constantine showed himself on the opposite side with a band of soldiers; the dead body was brought out of the bed-chamber; the murderer, taken in the fact, all aghast, &#160;</p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.v.xxx-p1.9"></A>   &#8220;Stood like a stone, silent and motionless;&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>  
<p class="Continue"><a name="iii.v.xxx-p2"></A>while <a name="iii.v.xxx-p2.1"></A>Constantine upbraided him for his impiety and enormous guilt. At last <a name="iii.v.xxx-p2.2"></A>Maximian obtained leave that the manner of his death should be at his own choice, and he strangled himself. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xxx-p3"></A>Thus that mightiest sovereign of Rome&#8212;who ruled so long with exceeding glory, and who celebrated his twentieth anniversary&#8212;thus that most haughty man had his neck broken, and ended his detestable life by a death base and ignominious. &#160;</p>
