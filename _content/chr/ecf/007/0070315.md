#### <span id="iii.v.vi-p0.1"></span>Chap. VI.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p1"></span><span id="iii.v.vi-p1.1"></span>Aurelian
might have recollected the fate of the captived emperor, yet, being of a
nature outrageous and headstrong, he forgot both <span
id="iii.v.vi-p1.2"></span>his sin and its punishment, and by deeds of
cruelty irritated the divine wrath. He was not, however, permitted to
accomplish what he had devised; for just as he began to give a loose to
his rage, he was slain. His bloody edicts had not yet reached the more
distant provinces, when he himself lay all bloody on the earth at
Cænophrurium in Thrace, assassinated by his familiar friends, who had
taken up groundless suspicions against him.  

<span id="iii.v.vi-p2"></span>Examples of such a nature, and so
numerous, ought to have deterred succeeding tyrants; nevertheless they
were not only not dismayed, but, in their misdeeds against God, became
more bold and presumptuous.
