#### <span id="iii.ii.vii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chap. VII.—Of the Variety of Philosophers, and Their Truth.

<span id="iii.ii.vii.vii-p1"></span>And because the philosophers did not
comprehend this main point, they were neither able to comprehend truth,
although they for the most part both saw and explained those things of
which the main point itself consists. But different persons brought
forward all these things, and in different ways, not connecting the
causes of things, nor the consequences, nor the reasons, so that they
might join together and complete that main point which comprises the
whole. But it is easy to show that almost the whole truth has been
divided by philosophers and sects. For we do not overthrow philosophy,
as the Academics are accustomed to do, whose plan was to reply to
everything, which is rather to calumniate and mock; but we show that no
sect was so much out of the way, and no philosopher so vain, as not to
see something of the truth. <span id="fr_1338"></span>[1339](#fn_1338)
But while they are mad with the desire of contradicting, while they
defend their own arguments even though false, and overthrow those of
others even though true, not only has the truth escaped from them, which
they pretended that they were seeking, but they themselves lost it
chiefly through their own fault. But if there had been any one to
collect together the truth which was dispersed amongst individuals and
scattered amongst sects, and to reduce it to a body, he assuredly would
not disagree with us. But no one is able to do this, unless he has
experience <span id="fr_1339"></span>[1340](#fn_1339) and knowledge of
the truth. But to know the truth belongs to him only who has been taught
by God. For he cannot in any other way reject the things which are
false, or choose and approve of those which are true; but if even by
chance he should effect this, he would most surely act the part of the
philosopher; and though he could not defend those things by divine
testimonies, yet the truth would explain itself by its own light.
Wherefore the error of those is incredible, who, when they have approved
of any sect, and have devoted themselves to it, condemn all others as
false and vain, and arm themselves for battle, neither knowing what they
ought to defend nor what to refute; and make attacks everywhere, without
distinction, <span id="fr_1340"></span>[1341](#fn_1340) upon all things
which are brought forward by those who disagree with them.  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.vii-p5"></span>On account of these most obstinate
contentions of theirs, no philosophy existed which made a nearer
approach to the truth, for the whole truth has been comprised by these
in separate portions. <span id="fr_1341"></span>[1342](#fn_1341) <span
id="iii.ii.vii.vii-p6.2"></span>Plato said <span
id="fr_1342"></span>[1343](#fn_1342) that the world was made by God: the
prophets <span id="fr_1343"></span>[1344](#fn_1343) speak the same; and
the same is apparent from the verses of the <span
id="iii.ii.vii.vii-p8.3"></span>Sibyl. They therefore are in error, who
have said either that all things were produced of their own accord or
from an assemblage of atoms; <span id="fr_1344"></span>[1345](#fn_1344)
since so great a world, so adorned and of such magnitude, could neither
have been made nor arranged and set in order without some most skilful
author, and that very arrangement by which all things are perceived to
be kept together and to be governed bespeaks <span
id="fr_1345"></span>[1346](#fn_1345) an artificer with a most skilful
mind. The Stoics say that the world, and all things which are in it,
were made for the sake of men: the sacred writings <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346) teach us the same thing. Therefore
<span id="iii.ii.vii.vii-p11.4"></span>Democritus was in error, who
thought that they were poured forth from the earth like worms, without
any author or plan. For the reason of man’s creation belongs to a divine
mystery; and because he was unable to know this, he drew <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347) down man’s life to nothing. <span
id="iii.ii.vii.vii-p12.2"></span>Aristo asserted that men were born to
the exercise of virtue; we are also reminded of and learn the same from
the prophets. Therefore <span
id="iii.ii.vii.vii-p12.3"></span>Aristippus is deceived, who made man
subject to pleasure, that is, to evil, as though he were a beast. <span
id="iii.ii.vii.vii-p12.4"></span>Pherecydes and <span
id="iii.ii.vii.vii-p12.5"></span>Plato contended that souls were
immortal; but this is a peculiar doctrine in our religion. Therefore
<span id="iii.ii.vii.vii-p12.6"></span>Dicæarchus was mistaken, together
with <span id="iii.ii.vii.vii-p12.7"></span>Democritus, who argued that
souls perished with the body and were dissolved, <span
id="iii.ii.vii.vii-p12.8"></span>Zeno the Stoic taught that there were
infernal regions, and that the abodes of the good were separated from
the wicked; and that the former enjoyed peaceful and delightful regions,
but that the latter suffered punishment in dark places, and in dreadful
abysses of mire: the prophets show the same thing. Therefore <span
id="iii.ii.vii.vii-p12.9"></span>Epicurus was mistaken, who thought that
that was an invention <span id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348) of the
poets, and explained those punishments of the infernal regions, which
are spoken of, as happening in this life. Therefore the philosophers
touched upon the whole truth, and every secret of our holy religion; but
when others denied it, they were unable to defend that which they had
found, because the system did not agree <span
id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349) with the particulars; nor were they
able to reduce to a summary those things which they had perceived to be
true, as we have done above.
