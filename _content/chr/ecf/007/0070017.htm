</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p2"></A>Who, then, is so senseless as to imagine that he reigns in heaven who ought not even to have reigned on earth? It was not without humour that a certain poet wrote of the triumph of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p2.1"></A>Cupid: in which book he not only represented <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p2.2"></A>Cupid as the most powerful of the gods, but also as their conqueror. For having enumerated the loves of each, by which they had come into the power and dominion of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p2.3"></A>Cupid, he sets in array a procession, in which <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p2.4"></A>Jupiter, with the other gods, is led in chains before the chariot of him, celebrating a triumph. This is elegantly pictured by the poet, but it is not far removed from the truth. For he who is without virtue, who is overpowered by desire and wicked lusts, is not, <span><a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p2.5"></A>as the poet feigned</span>, in subjection to <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p2.6"></A>Cupid, but to everlasting death. But let us cease to speak concerning morals; let us examine the matter, in order that men may understand in what errors they are miserably engaged. The common people imagine that <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p2.7"></A>Jupiter reigns in heaven; both learned and unlearned are alike persuaded of this. For both religion itself, and prayers, and hymns, and shrines, and images demonstrate this. And yet they admit that he was also descended from <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p2.8"></A>Saturn and <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p2.9"></A>Rhea. How can he appear a god, or be believed, as the poet says, to be the author of men and all things, when innumerable thousands of men existed before his birth&#8212;those, for instance, who lived during the reign of Saturn, and enjoyed the light sooner than <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p2.10"></A>Jupiter? I see that one god was king in the earliest times, and another in the times that followed. It is therefore possible that there may be another hereafter. For if the former kingdom was changed, why should we not expect that the latter may possibly be changed, unless by chance it was possible for Saturn to produce one more powerful than himself, but impossible for <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p2.11"></A>Jupiter so to do? And yet the divine government is always unchangeable; or if it is changeable, which is an impossibility, it is undoubtedly changeable at all times. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p3"></A>Is it possible, then, for <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p3.1"></A>Jupiter to lose his kingdom as his father lost it? It is so undoubtedly. For when that deity had spared neither virgins nor married women, he abstained from <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p3.2"></A>Thetis only in consequence of an oracle which foretold that whatever son should be born from her would be greater than his father. And first of all there was in him a want of foreknowledge not befitting a god; for had not <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p3.3"></A>Themis related to him future events, he would not have known them of his own accord. But if he is not divine, he is not indeed a god; for the name of divinity is derived from god, as humanity is from man. Then there was a consciousness of weakness; but he who has feared, must plainly have feared one greater than himself. But he who does this assuredly knows that he is not the greatest, since something greater can exist. He also swears most solemnly by the Stygian marsh: &#8220;Which is set forth the sole object of religious dread to the gods above.&#8221; What is this object of religious dread? Or by whom is it set forth? <A NAME="page_21"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 21</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-Page_21"></A>Is there, then, some mighty power which may punish the gods who commit perjury? What is this great dread of the infernal marsh, if they are immortal? Why should they fear that which none are about to see, except those who are bound by the necessity of death? Why, then, do men raise their eyes to the heaven? Why do they swear by the gods above, when the gods above themselves have recourse to the infernal gods, and find among them an object of veneration and worship? But what is the meaning of that saying, that there are fates whom all the gods and <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p3.4"></A>Jupiter himself obey? If the power of the Parc&aelig; is so great, that they are of more avail than all the heavenly gods, and their ruler and lord himself, why should not they be rather said to reign, since necessity compels all the gods to obey their laws and ordinances? Now, who can entertain a doubt that he who is subservient to anything cannot be greatest? For if he were so, he would not receive fates, but would appoint them. Now I return to another subject which I had omitted. In the case of one goddess only he exercised self-restraint, though he was deeply enamoured of her; but this was not from any virtue, but through fear of a successor. But this fear plainly denotes one who is both mortal and feeble, and of no weight: for at the very hour of his birth he might have been put to death, as his elder brother had been put to death; and if it had been possible for him to have lived, he would never have given up the supreme power to a younger brother. But <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p3.5"></A>Jupiter himself having been preserved by stealth, and stealthily nourished, was called <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p3.6"></A>Zeus, or <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p3.7"></A>Zen,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">50</FONT></A>
 not, as they imagine, from the fervor of heavenly fire, or because he is the giver of life, or because he breathes life into living creatures, which power belongs to God alone; for how can he impart the breath of life who has himself received it from another source? But he was so called because he was the first who lived of the male children of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p4.8"></A>Saturn. Men, therefore, might have had another god as their ruler, if Saturn had not been deceived by his wife. But it will be said the poets feigned these things. Whoever entertains this opinion is in error. For they spoke respecting men; but in order that they might embellish those whose memory they used to celebrate with praises, they said that they were gods. Those things, therefore, which they spoke concerning them as gods were feigned, and not those which they spoke concerning them as men; and this will be manifest from an instance which we will bring forward. When about to offer violence to <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p4.9"></A>Danae, he poured into her lap a great quantity of golden coins. This was the price which he paid for her dishonour. But the poets who spoke about him as a god, that they might not weaken the authority of his supposed majesty, feigned that he himself descended in a shower of gold, making use of the same figure with which they speak of showers of iron when they describe a multitude of darts and arrows. He is said to have carried away <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p4.10"></A>Ganymede by an eagle; it is a picture of the poets. But he either carried him off by a legion, which has an eagle for its standard; or the ship on board of which he was placed had its tutelary deity in the shape of an eagle, just as it had the effigy of a bull when he seized <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p4.11"></A>Europa and conveyed her across the sea. In the same manner, it is related that he changed <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p4.12"></A>Io, the daughter of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p4.13"></A>Inachus, into a heifer. And in order that she might escape the anger of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p4.14"></A>Juno, just as she was, now covered with bristly hair, and in the shape of a heifer, she is said to have swam over the sea, and to have come into Egypt; and there, having recovered her former appearance, she became the goddess who is now called <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p4.15"></A>Isis. By what argument, then, can it be proved that <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p4.16"></A>Europa did not sit on the bull, and that <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p4.17"></A>Io was not changed into a heifer? Because there is a fixed day in the annals on which the voyage of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p4.18"></A>Isis is celebrated; from which fact we learn that she did not swim across the sea, but sailed over. Therefore they who appear to themselves to be wise because they understand that there cannot be a living and earthly body in heaven, reject the whole story of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p4.19"></A>Ganymede as false, and perceive that the occurrence took place on earth, inasmuch as the matter and the lust itself is earthly. The poets did not therefore invent these transactions, for if they were to do so they would be most worthless; but they added a certain colour to the transactions.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">51</FONT></A>
 For it was not for the purpose of detraction that they said these things, but from a desire to embellish them. Hence men are deceived; especially because, while they think that all these things are feigned by the poets, they worship that of which they are ignorant. For they do not know what is the limit of poetic licence, how far it is allowable to proceed in fiction, since it is the business of the poet with some gracefulness to change and transfer actual occurrences into other representations by oblique transformations. But to feign the whole of that which you relate, that is to be foolish and deceitful rather than to be a poet. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6"></A>But grant that they feigned those things which are believed to be fabulous, did they also feign those things which are related about the female deities and the marriages of the gods? Why, then, are they so represented, and so worshipped? unless by chance not the poets only, but painters also, and statuaries, speak falsehoods. For if <A NAME="page_22"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 22</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-Page_22"></A>this is the <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.1"></A>Jupiter who is called by you a god, if it is not he who was born from <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.2"></A>Saturn and <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.3"></A>Ops, no other image but his alone ought to have been placed in all the temples. What meaning have the effigies of women? What the doubtful sex? in which, if this <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.4"></A>Jupiter is represented, the very stones will confess that he is a man. They say that the poets have spoken falsely, and yet they believe them: yes, truly they prove by the fact itself that the poets did not speak falsely; for they so frame the images of the gods, that, from the very diversity of sex, it appears that these things which the poets say are true. For what other conclusion does the image of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.5"></A>Ganymede and the effigy of the eagle admit of, when they are placed before the feet of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.6"></A>Jupiter in the temples, and are worshipped equally with himself, except that the memory of impious guilt and debauchery remains for ever? Nothing, therefore, is wholly invented by the poets: something perhaps is transferred and obscured by oblique fashioning, under which the truth was enwrapped and concealed; as that which was related about the dividing of the kingdoms by lot. For they say that the heaven fell to the share of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.7"></A>Jupiter, the sea to <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.8"></A>Neptune, and the infernal regions to <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.9"></A>Pluto. Why was not the earth rather taken as the third portion, except that the transaction took place on the earth? Therefore it is true that they so divided and portioned out the government of the world, that the empire of the east fell to <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.10"></A>Jupiter, a part of the west was allotted to <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.11"></A>Pluto, who had the surname of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.12"></A>Agesilaus; because the region of the east, from which light is given to mortals, seems to be higher, but the region of the west lower. Thus they so veiled the truth under a fiction, that the truth itself detracted nothing from the public persuasion. It is manifest concerning the share of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.13"></A>Neptune; for we say that his kingdom resembled that unlimited authority possessed by <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.14"></A>Mark Antony, to whom the senate had decreed the power of the maritime coast, that he might punish the pirates, and tranquillize the whole sea. Thus all the maritime coasts, together with the islands, fell to the lot of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.15"></A>Neptune. How can this be proved? Undoubtedly ancient stories attest it. <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.16"></A>Euhemerus, an ancient author, who was of the city of Messene, collected the actions of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.17"></A>Jupiter and of the others, who are esteemed gods, and composed a history from the titles and sacred inscriptions which were in the most ancient temples, and especially in the sanctuary of the <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.18"></A>Triphylian Jupiter, where an inscription indicated that a golden column had been placed by <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.19"></A>Jupiter himself, on which column he wrote an account of his exploits, that posterity might have a memorial of his actions. This history was translated and followed by <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.20"></A>Ennius, whose words are these: &#8220;Where <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.21"></A>Jupiter gives to <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p6.22"></A>Neptune the government of the sea, that he might reign in all the islands and places bordering on the sea.&#8221; &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p7"></A>The accounts of the poets, therefore, are true, but veiled with an outward covering and show. It is possible that Mount Olympus may have supplied the poets with the hint for saying that <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p7.1"></A>Jupiter obtained the kingdom of heaven, because Olympus is the common name both of the mountain and of heaven. But the same history informs us that <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p7.2"></A>Jupiter dwelt on Mount Olympus, when it says: &#8220;At that time <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p7.3"></A>Jupiter spent the greatest part of his life on Mount Olympus; and they used to resort to him thither for <span><a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p7.4"></A>the administration of</span> justice, if any matters were disputed. Moreover, if any one had found out any new invention which might be useful for human life, he used to come thither and display it to <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p7.5"></A>Jupiter.&#8221; The poets transfer many things after this manner, not for the sake of speaking falsely against the objects of their worship, but that they may by variously coloured figures add beauty and grace to their poems. But they who do not understand the manner, or the cause, or the nature of that which is represented by figure, attack the poets as false and sacrilegious. Even the philosophers were deceived by this error; for because these things which are related about <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p7.6"></A>Jupiter appeared unsuited to the character of a god, they introduced two Jupiters, one natural, the other fabulous. They saw, on the one hand, that which was true, that he, forsooth, concerning whom the poets speak, was man; but in the case of that natural <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p7.7"></A>Jupiter, led by the common practise of superstition, they committed an error, inasmuch as they transferred the name of a man to God, who, as we have already said, because He is one only, has no need of a name. But it is undeniable that he is <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p7.8"></A>Jupiter who was born from <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p7.9"></A>Ops and <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p7.10"></A>Saturn. It is therefore an empty persuasion on the part of those who give the name of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p7.11"></A>Jupiter to the Supreme God. For some are in the habit of defending their errors by this excuse; for, when convinced of the unity of God, since they cannot deny this, they affirm that they worship Him, but that it is their pleasure that He should be called <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p7.12"></A>Jupiter. But what can be more absurd than this? For <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p7.13"></A>Jupiter is not accustomed to be worshipped without the accompanying worship of his wife and daughter. From which his real nature is evident; nor is it lawful for that name to be transferred thither,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">52</FONT></A>
 where there is neither any <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p8.1"></A>Minerva nor <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p8.2"></A>Juno. Why should I say that the peculiar meaning of this name does not express a divine, but human power? For <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p8.3"></A>Cicero explains the names <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p8.4"></A>Jupiter and <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p8.5"></A>Juno as being derived from giving help;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">53</FONT></A>
 and <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p9.2"></A>Jupiter is so called as if he were a helping father,&#8212;a name which is ill adapted to God: <A NAME="page_23"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 23</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-Page_23"></A>for to help is the part of a man conferring some aid upon one who is a stranger, and in a case where the benefit is small. No one implores God to help him, but to preserve him, to give him life and safety, which is a much greater and more important matter than to help. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p10"></A>And since we are speaking of a father, no father is said to help his sons when he begets or brings them up. For that expression is too insignificant to denote the magnitude of the benefit derived from a father. How much more unsuitable is it to God, who is our true Father, by whom we exist, and whose we are altogether, by whom we are formed, endued with life, and enlightened, who bestows upon us life, gives us safety, and supplies us with various kinds of food! He has no apprehension of the divine benefits who thinks that he is only aided by God. Therefore he is not only ignorant, but impious, who disparages the excellency of the supreme power under the name of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p10.1"></A>Jupiter. Wherefore, if both from his actions and character we have proved that <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p10.2"></A>Jupiter was a man, and reigned on earth, it only remains that we should also investigate his death. <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p10.3"></A>Ennius, in his sacred history, having described all the actions which he performed in his life, at the close thus speaks: Then <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p10.4"></A>Jupiter, when he had five times made a circuit of the earth, and bestowed governments upon all his friends and relatives, and left laws to men, provided them with a settled mode of life and corn, and given them many other benefits, and having been honoured with immortal glory and remembrance, left lasting memorials to his friends, and when his age&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">54</FONT></A>
 was almost spent, he changed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">55</FONT></A>
 his life in Crete, and departed to the gods. And the Curetes, his sons, took charge of him, and honoured him; and his tomb is in Crete, in the town of Cnossus, and Vesta is said to have founded this city; and on his tomb is an inscription in ancient Greek characters, &#8220;Zan Kronou,&#8221; which is in Latin, &#8220;<a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p12.1"></A>Jupiter the son of Saturn.&#8221; This undoubtedly is not handed down by poets, but by writers of ancient events; and these things are so true, that they are confirmed by some verses of the <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p12.2"></A>Sibyls, to this effect:&#8212; &#160;</p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p12.3"></A>   &#8220;Inanimate demons, images of the dead, <br>    Whose tombs the ill-fated Crete possesses as a boast.&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p13"></A><a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p13.1"></A>Cicero, in his treatise concerning the Nature of the Gods, having said that three Jupiters were enumerated by theologians, adds that the third was of Crete, the son of Saturn, and that his tomb is shown in that island. How, therefore, can a god be alive in one place, and dead in another; in one place have a temple, and in another a tomb? Let the Romans then know that their Capitol, that is the chief head of their objects of public veneration, is nothing but an empty monument. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p14"></A>Let us now come to his father who reigned before him, and who perhaps had more power in himself, because he is said to be born from the meeting of such great elements. Let us see what there was in him worthy of a god, especially that he is related to have had the golden age, because in his reign there was justice in the earth. I find something in him which was not in his son. For what is so befitting the character of a god, as a just government and an age of piety? But when, on the same principle, I reflect that he is a son, I cannot consider him as the Supreme God; for I see that there is something more ancient than himself,&#8212;namely, the heaven and the earth. But I am in search of a God beyond whom nothing has any existence, who is the source and origin of all things. He must of necessity exist who framed the heaven itself, and laid the foundations of the earth. But if <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p14.1"></A>Saturn was born from these, as it is supposed, how can he be the chief God, since he owes his origin to another? Or who presided over the universe before the birth of Saturn? But this, as I recently said, is a fiction of the poets. For it was impossible that the senseless elements, which are separated by so long an interval, should meet together and give birth to a son, or that he who was born should not at all resemble his parents, but should have a form which his parents did not possess. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p15"></A>Let us therefore inquire what degree of truth lies hid under this figure. <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p15.1"></A>Minucius Felix, in his treatise which has the title of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p15.2"></A>Octavius,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">56</FONT></A>
 alleged these proofs: &#8220;That <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p16.2"></A>Saturn, when he had been banished by his son, and had come into Italy, was called the son of C&#339;lus (heaven), because we are accustomed to say that those whose virtue we admire, or those who have unexpectedly arrived, have fallen from heaven; and that he was called the son of earth, because we name those who are born from unknown parents sons of earth.&#8221; These things, indeed, have some resemblance to the truth, but are not true, because it is evident that even during his reign he was so esteemed. He might have argued thus: That Saturn, being a very powerful king, in order that the memory of his parents might be preserved, gave their names to the heaven and earth, whereas these were before called by other names, for which reason we know that names were applied both to mountains and rivers. For when the poets speak of the offspring of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p16.3"></A>Atlas, or of the river Inachus, they do not absolutely say that men could possibly be born from inanimate objects; but they undoubtedly indicate those who were born from those men, who either during their lives or after their death gave their <A NAME="page_24"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 24</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-Page_24"></A>names to mountains or rivers. For that was a common practise among the ancients, and especially among the Greeks. Thus we have heard that seas received the names of those who had fallen into them, as the &AElig;gean, the Icarian, and the Hellespont. In Latium, also, <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p16.4"></A>Aventinus gave his name to the mountain on which he was buried; and <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p16.5"></A>Tiberinus, or Tiber, gave his name to the river in which he was drowned. No wonder, then, if the names of those who had given birth to most powerful kings were attributed to the heaven and earth. Therefore it appears that <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p16.6"></A>Saturn was not born from heaven, which is impossible, but from that man who bore the name of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p16.7"></A>Uranus. And <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p16.8"></A>Trismegistus attests the truth of this; for when he said that very few had existed in whom there was perfect learning, he mentioned by name among these his relatives, Uranus, Saturn, and <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p16.9"></A>Mercury. And because he was ignorant of these things, he gave another account of the matter; how he might have argued, I have shown. Now I will say in what manner, at what time, and by whom this was done; for it was not Saturn who did this, but <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p16.10"></A>Jupiter. <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p16.11"></A>Ennius thus relates in his sacred history: &#8220;Then <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p16.12"></A>Pan leads him to the mountain, which is called the pillar of heaven. Having ascended thither, he surveyed the lands far and wide, and there on that mountain he builds an altar to <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p16.13"></A>C&#339;lus; and <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p16.14"></A>Jupiter was the first who offered sacrifice on that altar. In that place he looked up to heaven, by which name we now call it, and that which was above the world which was called the firmament,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">57</FONT></A>
 and he gave to the heaven its name from the name of his grandfather; and <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p17.3"></A>Jupiter in prayer first gave the name of heaven to that which was called firmament,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">58</FONT></A>
 and he burnt entire the victim which he there offered in sacrifice.&#8221; Nor is it here only that <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p18.3"></A>Jupiter is found to have offered sacrifice. C&aelig;sar also, in Aratus, relates that <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p18.4"></A>Aglaosthenes says that when he was setting out from the island of Naxos against the Titans, and was offering sacrifice on the shore, an eagle flew to <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p18.5"></A>Jupiter as an omen, and that the victor received it as a good token, and placed it under his own protection. But the sacred history testifies that even beforehand an eagle had sat upon his head, and portended to him the kingdom. To whom, then, could <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p18.6"></A>Jupiter have offered sacrifice, except to his grandfather C&#339;lus, who, according to the saying of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p18.7"></A>Euhemerus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_58"><FONT SIZE="1">59</FONT></A>
 died in Oceania, and was buried in the town of Aulatia? &#160;</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p19"></A> <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p19.1"></A>Euhemerus was a Sicilian author of the age of <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p19.2"></A>Alexander the Great. He wrote a sacred history containing an account of the several gods who were worshipped in Greece, whom he represents as having originally been men who had distinguished themselves by their exploits, or benefits conferred upon men, and who were therefore, after their death, worshipped as gods. The Christian writers frequently refer to <a name="iii.ii.i.xii-p19.3"></A>Euhemerus as helping them to prove that the pagan mythology consisted only of fables invented by men.
