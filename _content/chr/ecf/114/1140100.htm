<p class="c36"><a name="v.vi-p3"></A>&#8220;Who being the brightness of His Glory and the express Image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins.&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c17"><a name="v.vi-p4"></A> [1.] <span class="c11"><a name="v.vi-p4.1"></A>Everywhere</span> indeed a reverential mind is requisite, but especially when we say or hear anything of God: Since neither can tongue speak nor thought &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2734"></A><A HREF="#fn_2734"><FONT SIZE="1">2735</FONT></A>
 hear anything suitable to our God. And why speak I of tongue or thought? &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2735"></A><A HREF="#fn_2735"><FONT SIZE="1">2736</FONT></A>
  For not even the understanding &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2736"></A><A HREF="#fn_2736"><FONT SIZE="1">2737</FONT></A>
 which far excels these, will be able to comprehend anything accurately, when we desire to utter aught concerning God. For if &#8220;the peace of God surpasseth all understanding&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007"> Philip. iv. 7 </a><a name="v.vi-p7.3"></A> ), and &#8220;the things which are prepared for them that love Him have not entered into the heart of man&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009"> 1 Cor. ii. 9 </a><a name="v.vi-p7.4"></A> ); much more He Himself, the God of peace, the Creator of all things, doth by a wide measure exceed our 	 reasoning. We ought therefore to receive all things with faith and reverence, and when our discourse &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2737"></A><A HREF="#fn_2737"><FONT SIZE="1">2738</FONT></A>
 fails through weakness, and is not able to set forth accurately the things which are spoken, then especially to glorify God, for that we have such a God, surpassing both our thought and our conception. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2738"></A><A HREF="#fn_2738"><FONT SIZE="1">2739</FONT></A>
  For many of our conceptions &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2739"></A><A HREF="#fn_2739"><FONT SIZE="1">2740</FONT></A>
 about God, we are unable to express, as also many things we express, but have not strength to conceive of them. As for instance:&#8212;That God is everywhere, we know; but how, we no longer understand. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2740"></A><A HREF="#fn_2740"><FONT SIZE="1">2741</FONT></A>
  That there is a certain incorporeal power the cause of all our good things, we know: but how it is, or what it is, we know not. Lo! we speak, and do not understand. I said, That He is everywhere, but I do not understand it. I said, That He is without beginning, but I do not understand it. I said, That He begat from Himself, and again I know not how I shall understand it. And some things there are which we may not even speak&#8212;as for instance, thought conceives  	 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2741"></A><A HREF="#fn_2741"><FONT SIZE="1">2742</FONT></A>
 but cannot utter.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p13"></A>And to show thee that even Paul is weak and doth not put out his illustrations with exactness; and to make thee tremble and refrain from searching too far, hear what he says, having called Him Son and named Him Creator, &#8220;Who being the brightness of His Glory, and the express image of His person.&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p14"></A> This we must receive with reverence and clear of all incongruities. &#8220;The brightness of His glory,&#8221; saith he. But observe in what reference he understands this, and so do thou receive it:&#8212;that He is of Him: &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2742"></A><A HREF="#fn_2742"><FONT SIZE="1">2743</FONT></A>
  without passion: that He is neither greater, nor less; since there are some, who derive certain strange things from the illustration. For, say they, &#8220;the brightness&#8221; is not substantial, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2743"></A><A HREF="#fn_2743"><FONT SIZE="1">2744</FONT></A>
 but hath its being in another. Now do not thou, O man, so receive it, neither be thou sick of the disease of Marcellus &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2744"></A><A HREF="#fn_2744"><FONT SIZE="1">2745</FONT></A>
 and Photinus. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2745"></A><A HREF="#fn_2745"><FONT SIZE="1">2746</FONT></A>
  For he hath a remedy for thee close at hand, that thou fall not into that imagination, nor doth he leave thee to be hurried down into that fatal malady. And what saith he? &#8220;And the express image of His person&#8221; [or &#8220;subsistence&#8221; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2746"></A><A HREF="#fn_2746"><FONT SIZE="1">2747</FONT></A>
 ]: that is, just as He [the Father] is personally subsisting, being in need of nothing, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2747"></A><A HREF="#fn_2747"><FONT SIZE="1">2748</FONT></A>
 so also the Son. For he saith this here, showing the undeviating similitude &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2748"></A><A HREF="#fn_2748"><FONT SIZE="1">2749</FONT></A>
 and the peculiar image of the Prototype, that He [the Son] is in subsistence by Himself.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p22"></A>For he who said above, that &#8220;by Him He made all things&#8221; here assigns to Him absolute authority. For what doth he add? &#8220;And upholding all things by the word of His power&#8221;; that we might hence infer not merely His being the express image of His Person, but also His governing all things with absolute authority.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p23"></A>See then, how he applies to the Son that which is proper to the Father. For on this account he did not say simply, &#8220;and upholding all things,&#8221; nor did he say, &#8220;by His power,&#8221; but, &#8220;by the word of His power.&#8221; For much as just now we saw him gradually ascend and descend; so also now, as by steps, he goes up on high, then again descends, and saith, &#8220;by whom also He made the worlds.&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p24"></A>Behold how here also he goes on two paths, by the one leading us away from Sabellius, by the other from Arius, yea and on another, that He [Christ] should not be accounted un <A NAME="page_371"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 371</FONT></A> <a name="v.vi-Page_371"></A> originated, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2749"></A><A HREF="#fn_2749"><FONT SIZE="1">2750</FONT></A>
 which he does also throughout, nor yet alien from God. For if, even after so much, there are some who assert that He is alien, and assign to Him another father, and say that He is at variance with Him;&#8212;had [Paul] not declared these things, what would they not have uttered?</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p26"></A> How then does he this? When he is compelled to heal, then is he compelled also to utter lowly things: as for instance, &#8220;He appointed Him&#8221; (saith he) &#8220;heir of all things,&#8221; and &#8220;by Him He made the worlds.&#8221; ( <i>Supra</i> , <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002">Heb. 1.2</a><a name="v.vi-p26.1"></A></p>
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p27"></A></p>
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p28"></A><i></i><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010">Heb. 1.10</a><a name="v.vi-p28.1"></A> .) Nowhere is there the saying &#8220;by whom,&#8221; or that 	 &#8220;by Him He made the worlds.&#8221; What then? Were they not made by Him? Yes, but not, as thou sayest or imaginest, &#8220;as by an instrument&#8221;: nor as though He would not have made them unless the Father had reached out a hand to Him. For as He &#8220;judgeth no man&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022"> John v. 22 </a><a name="v.vi-p28.2"></A> ), and is said to judge by the Son, in that He begat Him a judge; so also, to create by Him, in that He begat Him a Creator. And if the Father be the original cause of Him, in that 	 He is Father, much more of the things which have been made by Him. When therefore he would show that He is of Him, he speaks of necessity lowly things. But when he would utter high things, Marcellus takes a handle, and Sabellius; avoiding however the excess of both, he holds a middle [way]. For neither does he dwell on the humiliation, lest Paul of Samosata should obtain a standing place, nor yet does he for ever abide in the high sayings; but shows on the contrary His abundant nearness, 	 lest Sabellius rush in upon him. He names Him &#8220;Son,&#8221; and immediately Paul of Samosata comes on him, saying that He is a son, as the many are. But he gives him a fatal wound, calling Him &#8220;Heir.&#8221; But yet, with Arius, he is shameless. For the saying, &#8220;He appointed Him heir,&#8221; they both hold: the former one saying, it comes of weakness; the other still presses objections, endeavoring to support himself by the clause which follows. For by saying, &#8220;by whom also He made the 	 worlds,&#8221; he strikes backwards the impudent Samosatene: while Arius still seems to be strong. Nevertheless see how he smites him likewise, saying again, &#8220;who being the brightness of His glory.&#8221; But behold! Sabellius again springs on us, with Marcellus, and Photinus: but on all these also he inflicts one blow, saying, &#8220;and the express image of His person and upholding all things by the word of His power.&#8221; Here again he wounds Marcion too; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2750"></A><A HREF="#fn_2750"><FONT SIZE="1">2751</FONT></A>
 not very severely, but however he doth wound him. For through the whole of this Epistle he is fighting against them.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p30"></A>But the very thing which he said, &#8220;the brightness of the glory,&#8221; hear also Christ Himself saying, &#8220;I am the Light of the world.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012"> John viii. 12 </a><a name="v.vi-p30.1"></A> .) Therefore he [the Apostle] uses the word &#8220;brightness,&#8221; showing that this was said in the sense of &#8220;Light of Light.&#8221; Nor is it this alone which he shows, but also that He hath enlightened our souls; and He hath Himself manifested the Father, and by &#8220;the brightness&#8221; he has 	 indicated the nearness of the Being [of the Father and the Son &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2751"></A><A HREF="#fn_2751"><FONT SIZE="1">2752</FONT></A>
 ]. Observe the subtlety of his expressions. He hath taken one essence and subsistence to indicate two subsistences. Which he also doth in regard to the knowledge of the Spirit &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2752"></A><A HREF="#fn_2752"><FONT SIZE="1">2753</FONT></A>
 ; for as he saith that the knowledge of the Father is one with that of the Spirit, as being indeed one, and in nought varying from itself ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010"> 1 Cor. ii. 10-12 </a><a name="v.vi-p32.2"></A> ): so also here he hath taken hold of one certain [thing] whereby to express the subsistence of the Two. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2753"></A><A HREF="#fn_2753"><FONT SIZE="1">2754</FONT></A>
</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p34"></A>And he adds that He is &#8220;the express Image.&#8221; <A NAME="page_372"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 372</FONT></A> <a name="v.vi-Page_372"></A> For the &#8220;express Image&#8221; is something other &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2754"></A><A HREF="#fn_2754"><FONT SIZE="1">2755</FONT></A>
 than its Prototype: yet not Another in all respects, but as to having real subsistence. Since here also the term, &#8220;express image,&#8221; indicates there is no variation from that whereof it is the &#8220;express image&#8221;: its similarity in all respects. When therefore he calls Him both Form, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2755"></A><A HREF="#fn_2755"><FONT SIZE="1">2756</FONT></A>
 and express Image, what can they say? &#8220;Yea,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;man is also called an Image of God.&#8221; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2756"></A><A HREF="#fn_2756"><FONT SIZE="1">2757</FONT></A>
  What then! is he so [an image of Him] as the Son is? No (saith he) but because the term, image, doth not show resemblance. And yet, in that man is called an Image, it showeth resemblance, as in man. For what God is in Heaven, that man is on earth, I mean as to dominion. And as he hath power over all things on earth, so also hath God power over all things which are in heaven and which are on earth. But otherwise, man is not called &#8220;Express image,&#8221; he is not 	 called Form: which phrase declares the substance, or rather both substance and similarity in substance. Therefore just as &#8220;the form of a slave&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006">Phil. 2:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007">7</a><a name="v.vi-p37.5"></A> ) expresses no other thing than a man without variation &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2757"></A><A HREF="#fn_2757"><FONT SIZE="1">2758</FONT></A>
 [from human nature], so also &#8220;the form of God&#8221; expresses no other thing than God.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p39"></A>&#8220;Who being&#8221; (saith he) &#8220;the brightness of His glory.&#8221; See what Paul is doing. Having said, &#8220;Who being the brightness of His glory,&#8221; he added again, &#8220;He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty&#8221;: what names he hath used, nowhere finding a name for the Substance. For neither &#8220;the Majesty,&#8221; nor &#8220;the Glory&#8221; setteth forth the Name, which he wishes to say, but is not able to find a name. For this is what I said at the beginning, that 	 oftentimes we think something, and are not able to express [it]: since not even the word God is a name of substance, nor is it at all possible to find a name of that Substance.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p40"></A>And what marvel, if it be so in respect of God, since not even in respect of an Angel, could one find a name expressive of his substance? Perhaps too, neither in respect of the soul. For this name [soul] doth not seem to me to be significative of the substance thereof, but of breathing. For one may see that the same [thing] is called both Soul and Heart and Mind: for, saith he, &#8220;Create in me a clean heart, O God&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#010"> Ps. li. 10 </a><a name="v.vi-p40.1"></A> ), and one 	 may often see that it [the soul] is called spirit.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p41"></A>&#8220;And upholding all things by the word of His power.&#8221; Tell me, &#8220;God said&#8221; (it is written), &#8220;Let there be light&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003"> Gen. i. 3 </a><a name="v.vi-p41.1"></A> ): &#8220;the Father, saith one, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2758"></A><A HREF="#fn_2758"><FONT SIZE="1">2759</FONT></A>
 commanded, and the Son obeyed&#8221;? But behold here He also [the Son] acts by word. For (saith he), &#8220;And upholding all things&#8221;&#8212;that is, governing; He holds together what would fall to pieces; For, to hold the world together, is no less than to make it, but even greater (if one must say a strange thing). For the one is to bring forward something out of things which are not: but the other, when things which have been made are about to fill back into non-existence, to 	 hold and fasten them together, utterly at variance as they are with each other: this is indeed great and wonderful, and a certain proof of exceeding power.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p43"></A> Then showing the easiness, he said, &#8220;upholding&#8221;: (he did not say, governing, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2759"></A><A HREF="#fn_2759"><FONT SIZE="1">2760</FONT></A>
 from the figure of those who simply with their finger move anything, and cause it to go round.) Here he shows both the mass of the creation to be great, and that this greatness is nothing to Him. Then again he shows the freedom from the labor, saying, &#8220;By the word of His power.&#8221; Well said he, &#8220;By the word.&#8221; For since, with us, a word is accounted to be a bare thing, he shows that it is not bare with God. But, how &#8220;He upholdeth by the word,&#8221; he hath not 	 further added: for neither is it possible to know. Then he added concerning His majesty: for thus John also did: having said that &#8220;He is God&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001"> John i. 1 </a><a name="v.vi-p44.2"></A> ), he brought in the handiwork of the Creation. For the same thing which the one indirectly expressed, saying, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word,&#8221; and &#8220;All things were made by Him&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003"> John i. 3 </a><a name="v.vi-p44.3"></A> ), this did the other also openly declare by &#8220;the Word,&#8221; and by saying &#8220;by 	 whom also He made the worlds.&#8221; For thus he shows Him to be both a Creator, and before all ages. What then? when the prophet saith, concerning the Father, &#8220;Thou art from everlasting and to everlasting&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002"> Ps. xc. 2 </a><a name="v.vi-p44.4"></A> ), and concerning the Son, that He is before all ages, and the maker of all things&#8212;what can they say? Nay rather, when the very thing which was spoken of the Father,&#8212;&#8220;He which was before the worlds,&#8221;&#8212;this one may see spoken of the Son 	 also? And that which one saith, &#8220;He was life&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004"> John i. 4 </a><a name="v.vi-p44.5"></A> ), pointing out the preservation of the creation, that Himself is the Life of all things,&#8212;so also saith this other, &#8220;and upholding all things by the word of His power&#8221;: not as the Greeks who defraud Him, as much as in them lies, both of Creation itself, and of Providence, shutting up His power, to reach only as far as to the Moon.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p45"></A>&#8220;By Himself&#8221; (saith he) &#8220;having purged our sins.&#8221; Having spoken concerning those marvelous and great matters, which are most above us, he proceeds to speak also afterwards concerning His care for men. For indeed the former expression, &#8220;and upholding all things,&#8221; also was universal: nevertheless this is far greater, for it <A NAME="page_373"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 373</FONT></A> <a name="v.vi-Page_373"></A> also is universal: for, for His part, &#8220;all&#8221; men believed. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2760"></A><A HREF="#fn_2760"><FONT SIZE="1">2761</FONT></A>
  As John also, having said, &#8220;He was life,&#8221; and so pointed out His providence, saith again, and &#8220;He was light.&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p47"></A>&#8220;By Himself,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;having purged our sins, He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.&#8221; He here setteth down two very great proofs of His care: first the &#8220;purifying us from our sins,&#8221; then the doing it &#8220;by Himself.&#8221; And in many places, thou seest him making very much of this,&#8212;not only of our reconciliation with God, but also of this being accomplished through the Son. For the gift being truly great, was made even greater by the 	 fact that it was through the Son.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p48"></A> For &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2761"></A><A HREF="#fn_2761"><FONT SIZE="1">2762</FONT></A>
 in saying, &#8220;He sat on the right hand,&#8221; and, &#8220;having by Himself purged our sins,&#8221;&#8212;though he had put us in mind of the Cross, he quickly added the mention of the resurrection and ascension. And see his unspeakable wisdom: he said not, &#8220;He was commanded to sit down,&#8221; but &#8220;He sat down.&#8221; Then again, lest thou shouldest think that He standeth, he subjoins, &#8220;For to which of the angels said He at any time, Sit thou on My right hand.&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p50"></A>&#8220;He sat&#8221; (saith he) &#8220;on the right hand of the Majesty on high.&#8221; What is this &#8220;on high&#8221;? Doth he enclose God in place? Away with such a thought! but just as, when he saith, &#8220;on the right hand,&#8221; he did not describe Him as having figure, but showed His equal dignity with the Father; so, in saying &#8220;on high,&#8221; he did not enclose Him there, but expressed the being higher than all things, and having ascended up above all things. That is, He attained 	 even unto the very throne of the Father: as therefore the Father is on high, so also is He. For the &#8220;sitting together&#8221; implies nothing else than equal dignity. But if they say, that He said, &#8220;Sit Thou,&#8221; we may ask them, What then? did He speak to Him standing? Moreover, he said not that He commanded, not that He enjoined, but that &#8220;He said&#8221;: for no other reason, than that thou mightest not think Him without origin and without cause. For that this is why he said it, is 	 evident from the place of His sitting. For had he intended to signify inferiority, he would not have said, &#8220;on the right hand,&#8221; but on the left hand.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p51"></A> <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004">Heb. 1.4</a><a name="v.vi-p51.1"></A> . &#8220;Being made,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;so much better than the angels, as He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.&#8221; The &#8220;being made,&#8221; here, is instead of &#8220;being shown forth,&#8221; as one may say. Then also from what does he reason confidently? From the Name. Seest thou that the name Son is wont to declare true relationship? And indeed if He were not a true Son (and &#8220;true&#8221; is nothing 	 else than &#8220;of Him&#8221;), how does he reason confidently from this? For if He be Son only by grace, He not only is not &#8220;more excellent than the angels,&#8221; but is even less than they. How? Because righteous men too were called sons; and the name son, if it be not a genuine son, doth not avail to show the &#8220;excellency.&#8221; When too he would point out that there is a certain difference between creatures and their maker, hear what he saith:</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p52"></A> <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005">Heb. 1.5</a><a name="v.vi-p52.1"></A> . &#8220;For to which of the Angels said He at any time, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee. And again, I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son&#8221;? For these things indeed are spoken with reference also to the flesh: &#8220;I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son&#8221;&#8212;while this, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2762"></A><A HREF="#fn_2762"><FONT SIZE="1">2763</FONT></A>
 &#8220;Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee,&#8221; expresses nothing else than &#8220;from [the time] that God is.&#8221; For as He is said to be, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2763"></A><A HREF="#fn_2763"><FONT SIZE="1">2764</FONT></A>
 from the time present (for this befits Him more than any other), so also the [word] &#8220;To-day&#8221; seems to me to be spoken here with reference to the flesh. For when He hath taken hold of it, thenceforth he speaks out all boldly. For indeed the flesh partakes of the high things, just as the Godhead of the lowly. For He who disdained not to become man, and did not decline the reality, how should He have declined the expressions?</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p55"></A>Seeing then that we know these things, let us be ashamed of nothing, nor have any high thoughts. For if He Himself being God and Lord and Son of God, did not decline to take the form of a slave, much more ought we to do all things, though they be lowly. For tell me, O man, whence hast thou high thoughts? from things of this life? but these or ever they appear, run by. Or, from things spiritual? nay, this is itself one spiritual excellency,&#8212;to have no high 	 thoughts.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p56"></A>Wherefore then dost thou cherish high thoughts? because thou goest on aright? hear Christ saying, &#8220;When ye have done all things, say, we are unprofitable servants, for we have done that which was our duty to do.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010"> Luke xvii. 10 </a><a name="v.vi-p56.1"></A> .)</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p57"></A>Or because of thy wealth hast thou high thoughts? Dost thou not see those before thee, how they departed naked and desolate? did we not come naked into life, and naked also shall depart? who hath high thoughts on having what is another&#146;s? for they who will use it to their own enjoyment alone, are deprived of it how <A NAME="page_374"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 374</FONT></A> <a name="v.vi-Page_374"></A> ever unwillingly, often before death, and at death certainly. But (saith one) while we live we use them as we will. First of all, one 	 doth not lightly see any man using what he hath as he will. Next, if a man do even use things as he will, neither is this a great matter: for the present time is short compared with the ages without end. Art thou high-minded, O man, because thou art rich? on what account? for what cause? for this befalleth also robbers, and thieves, and man-slayers, and effeminate, and whoremongers, and all sorts of wicked men. Wherefore then art thou high-minded? Since if thou hast made meet use of 	 it, thou must not be high-minded, lest thou profane the commandment: but if unmeet, by this indeed [it has come to pass that] thou art become a slave of money, and goods, and art overcome by them. For tell me, if any man sick of a fever should drink much water, which for a short space indeed quencheth his thirst, but afterwards kindleth the flame, ought he to be high-minded? And what, if any man have many cares without cause, ought he therefore to be high-minded? tell me, wherefore? 	 because thou hast many masters? because thou hast ten thousand cares? because many will flatter thee? [Surely not.] For thou art even their slave. And to prove that to thee, hear plainly. The other affections which are within us, are in some cases useful. For instance, Anger is often useful. For (saith he) &#8220;unjust wrath shall not be innocent&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/apo/sir001.htm#022">Ecclesiasticus 1.22</a><a name="v.vi-p57.1"></A> ): wherefore it is possible for one to be justly in wrath. And again, &#8220;He that is angry with his brother without cause, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2764"></A><A HREF="#fn_2764"><FONT SIZE="1">2765</FONT></A>
 shall be in danger of hell.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022"> Matt. v. 22 </a><a name="v.vi-p58.4"></A> .) Again for instance, emulation, desire, [are useful]: the one when it hath reference to the procreation of children, the other when he directs his emulation to excellent things. As Paul also saith, &#8220;It is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#018"> Gal. iv. 18 </a><a name="v.vi-p58.5"></A> ) and, &#8220;Covet earnestly the best gifts.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031"> 1 Cor. xii. 31 </a><a name="v.vi-p58.6"></A> .) Both 	 therefore are useful: but an insolent spirit is in no case good, but is always unprofitable and hurtful.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p59"></A>However, if a man must be proud, [let it be] for poverty, not for wealth. Wherefore? Because he who can live upon a little, is far greater and better than he who cannot. For tell me, supposing certain persons called to the Imperial City, if some of them should need neither beasts, nor slaves, nor umbrellas, nor lodging-places, nor sandals, nor vessels, but it should suffice them to have bread, and to take water from the wells,&#8212;while others of them should say, 	 &#8220;unless ye give us conveyances, and a soft bed, we cannot come; unless also we have many followers, unless we may be allowed continually to rest ourselves, we cannot come, nor unless we have the use of beasts, unless too we may travel but a small portion of the day&#8212;and we have need of many other things also&#8221;: whom should we admire? those or these? plainly, these who require nothing. So also here: some need many things for the journey through this life; others, nothing. So that it 	 would be more fitting to be proud, for poverty if it were fitting at all.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p60"></A>&#8220;But the poor man,&#8221; they say, &#8220;is contemptible.&#8221; Not he, but those who despise him. For why do not I despise those who know not how to admire what they ought? Why, if a person be a painter, he will laugh to scorn all who jeer at him, so long as they are uninstructed; nor doth he regard the things which they say, but is content with his own testimony. And shall we depend on the opinion of the many? Therefore, we are worthy of contempt when men despise us 	 for our poverty, and we do not despise them nor call them miserable.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p61"></A>And I say not how many sins are produced by wealth, and how many good things by poverty. But rather, neither wealth nor poverty is excellent in itself, but through those who use it. The Christian shines out in poverty rather than in riches. How? He will be less arrogant, more sober-minded, graver, more equitable, more considerate: but he that is in wealth, hath many impediments to these things. Let us see then what the rich man does, or rather, he who useth 	 his wealth amiss. Such an one practiceth rapine, fraud, violence. Men&#146;s unseemly loves, unholy unions, witchcrafts, poisonings, all their other horrors,&#8212;wilt thou not find them produced by wealth? Seest thou, that in poverty rather than in wealth the pursuit of virtue is less laborious? For do not, I beseech thee, think that because rich men do not suffer punishment here, neither do they sin. Since if it were easy for a rich man to suffer punishment, thou wouldest surely have 	 found the prisons filled with them. But among its other evils, wealth hath this also, that he who possesseth it, transgressing in evil with impunity, will never be stayed from doing so, but will receive wounds without remedies, and no man will put a bridle on him.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p62"></A>And if a man choose, he will find that poverty affords us more resources even for pleasure. How? Because it is freed from cares, hatred, fighting, contention, strife, from evils out of number.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.vi-p63"></A>Therefore let us not follow after wealth, nor be forever envying those who possess much. But let those of us who have wealth, use it aright; and those who have not, let us not grieve for this, but give thanks for all things unto God, because He enableth us to receive with little labor the same reward with the rich, or even (if we will) a greater: and from small means we shall <A NAME="page_375"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 375</FONT></A> <a name="v.vi-Page_375"></A> have great gains. For so he that brought the two talents, was admired and 	 honored equally with him who brought the five. Now why? Because he was entrusted with [but] two talents, yet he accomplished all that in him lay, and brought in what was entrusted to him, doubled. Why then are we eager to have much entrusted to us, when we may by a little reap the same fruits, or even greater? when the labor indeed is less, but the reward much more? For more easily will a poor man part with his own, than a rich man who hath many and great possessions. What, know ye 	 not, that the more things a man hath, the more he setteth his love upon? Therefore, lest this befall us, let us not seek after wealth, nor let us be impatient of poverty, nor make haste to be rich: and let those of us who have [riches] so use them as Paul commanded. (&#8220;They that have,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;as though they had not, and they that use this world as not abusing it&#8221;&#8212; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029">1 Cor. 7:29</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031">31</a><a name="v.vi-p63.1"></A> ): that we may obtain the good things promised. And may it be 	 granted to us all to obtain them, by the grace and love of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor, now, and for ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>
