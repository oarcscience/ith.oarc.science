<span id="v.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="v.xix-p1.1"></span>Homily XV.</span>

<span id="v.xix-p2"></span> <span id="v.xix-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="v.xix-p2.2"></span>[Hebrews ix.
1-5](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001)<span
id="v.xix-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.xix-p3"></span> *“Then verily the first \[covenant\] had
also ordinances of divine service, and a*  <span
id="fr_3027"></span>[3028](#fn_3027) *worldly Sanctuary. For there was a
tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the Candlestick, and the Table,
and the Shew-bread, which is called the Sanctuary. And after the second
veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; which had the
golden censer and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid round about with
gold: wherein was the golden pot that had*  <span
id="fr_3028"></span>[3029](#fn_3028) *manna, and Aaron’s rod that
budded, and the tables of the covenant: and over it the Cherubim of
glory, shadowing the Mercy-seat: of which we cannot now speak
particularly.”*

<span id="v.xix-p6"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xix-p6.1"></span>He</span> has shown from the Priest, from the
Priesthood, from the Covenant, that that \[dispensation\] was to have an
end. From this point he shows it from the fashion of the tabernacle
itself. How? This, he says, \[was\] the “Holy”  <span
id="fr_3029"></span>[3030](#fn_3029) and the “Holy of Holies.”  <span
id="fr_3030"></span>[3031](#fn_3030) The holy place then is a symbol of
the former period (for there all things are done by means of
sacrifices); but the Holy of Holies of this that is now present.

<span id="v.xix-p9"></span> And by the Holy of Holies he means Heaven;
and by the veil, Heaven, and the Flesh  <span
id="fr_3031"></span>[3032](#fn_3031) “entereth  <span
id="fr_3032"></span>[3033](#fn_3032) into that within the veil”: that is
to say, “through the veil of His flesh.” ( *Supra* , [Heb.
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#019), [Heb.
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020)<span id="v.xix-p11.27"></span>
.)

<span id="v.xix-p12"></span> And it were well to speak of this passage,
taking it up from the beginning. What then does he say? “Then verily the
first had also” (the first what? “The Covenant”). “Ordinances of Divine
service.” What are “ordinances”? symbols or rights. Then;  <span
id="fr_3033"></span>[3034](#fn_3033) as (he means) it has not now. He
shows that it had already given place, for (he says) it *had* at that
time; so that now, although it stood, it is not.

<span id="v.xix-p14"></span>“And the worldly Sanctuary.” He calls it
“worldly,” inasmuch as it was permitted to all to tread it, and in the
same house the place was manifest where the priests stood, where the
Jews, the Proselytes, the Grecians, the Nazarites. Since, therefore even
Gentiles were permitted to tread it, he calls it “worldly.” For surely
the Jews were not “the world.”

<span id="v.xix-p15"></span>“For” (he says) “there was a tabernacle
made; the first, which is called holy, wherein was the Candlestick, and
the Table, and the Shew-bread.” These things are symbols of the world.

<span id="v.xix-p16"></span> “And after the second veil” (There was then
not one veil \[only\], but there was a veil without also) “the
tabernacle, which is called holy of holies.” Observe how everywhere he
calls it a tabernacle in regard of \[God’s\] encamping there.  <span
id="fr_3034"></span>[3035](#fn_3034)

<span id="v.xix-p18"></span>“Which had” (he says) “a golden Censer, and
the ark of the Covenant overlaid round about with gold: wherein was the
golden pot that held the manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and <span
id="page_439">p. 439</span> <span id="v.xix-Page_439"></span> the tables
of the covenant.” All these things were venerable and conspicuous
memorials of the Jewish obstinacy; “and the tables of the covenant” (for
they brake them) “And the manna” (for they murmured; and therefore
handing on the memory thereof to posterity, He commanded it to be laid
up in a golden pot). “And Aaron’s rod that budded. And over it, the
Cherubim of glory.” What is “the Cherubim of glory”? He either means
“the glorious,” or those which are under God.  <span
id="fr_3035"></span>[3036](#fn_3035) “Shadowing the mercy-seat.”

<span id="v.xix-p20"></span> But in another point of view also he extols
these things in his discourse, in order to show that those which come
after them are greater. “Of which” (he says) “we cannot now speak
particularly.” In these words he hints that these were not merely what
was seen, but were a sort of enigmas.  <span
id="fr_3036"></span>[3037](#fn_3036) “Of which” (he says) “we cannot now
speak particularly,” perhaps because they needed a long discourse.

<span id="v.xix-p22"></span>\[2.\] [Heb.
9.6](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#006)<span id="v.xix-p22.1"></span> .
“Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into
the first tabernacle accomplishing the service \[of God\].” That is,
these things indeed were \[there\], but the Jews did not enjoy them:
they saw them not. So that they were no more theirs than \[ours\] for
whom they prophesied.  <span id="fr_3037"></span>[3038](#fn_3037)

<span id="v.xix-p24"></span>( [Heb.
9.7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007)<span id="v.xix-p24.1"></span> )
“But into the second the High Priest went alone once  <span
id="fr_3038"></span>[3039](#fn_3038) every year, not without blood,
which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people.”  <span
id="fr_3039"></span>[3040](#fn_3039) Thou seest that the types were
already laid down beforehand? for, lest they should say, “how is there
\[but\] one sacrifice?” he shows that this was so from the beginning,
since at least the more holy and the awful \[sacrifice\] was \[but\]
one. And how did the High Priest offer once for all? Thus were they wont
\[to do\] from the beginning, for then also (he says) “the High Priest”
offered “once for all.”

<span id="v.xix-p27"></span>And well said he, “not without blood.” (Not
indeed without blood, yet not this blood, for the business was not so
great.) He signifies that there shall be a sacrifice, not consumed by
fire, but rather distinguished by blood. For inasmuch as he called the
Cross a sacrifice, though it had neither fire, nor logs, nor was offered
many times, but had been offered in blood once for all; he shows that
the ancient sacrifice also was of this kind, was offered “once for all”
in blood.

<span id="v.xix-p28"></span> “Which he offers for himself;” again, “for
himself; and for the errors of the people.” He said not “sins”; but
“errors,” that they might not be high-minded. For even if thou hast not
sinned intentionally, yet unintentionally thou hast erred,  <span
id="fr_3040"></span>[3041](#fn_3040) and from this no man is pure.

<span id="v.xix-p30"></span>And everywhere \[he adds\] the “for
himself,” showing that Christ is much greater. For if He be separated
from our sins, how did He “offer for Himself”? Why then saidst thou
these things (one says)? Because this is \[a mark\] of One that is
superior.

<span id="v.xix-p31"></span> \[3.\] Thus far there is no speculation.
 <span id="fr_3041"></span>[3042](#fn_3041) But from this point he
philosophizes  <span id="fr_3042"></span>[3043](#fn_3042) and says, (
[Heb. 9.8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008)<span
id="v.xix-p33.2"></span> ) “The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way
into the Holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first
tabernacle was yet standing.” For this cause (he says) have these things
been thus “ordained,” that we might learn that “the Holy of Holies,”
that is, Heaven, is as yet inaccessible. Let us not then think (he says)
that because we do not enter them, they have no existence:  inasmuch as
neither did we enter the Most Holy \[place\].

<span id="v.xix-p34"></span> [Heb.
9.9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009)<span id="v.xix-p34.1"></span> .
“Which” (he says) “was established  <span
id="fr_3043"></span>[3044](#fn_3043) as a figure for the time then
present.”  <span id="fr_3044"></span>[3045](#fn_3044) What does he mean
by “the time present”? That before the coming of Christ: For after the
coming of Christ, it is no longer a time present: For how \[could it
be\], having arrived, and being ended?

<span id="v.xix-p37"></span> There is too something else which he
indicates, when he says this, “which \[was\] a figure for the time then
present,” that is, became the Type. “In which  <span
id="fr_3045"></span>[3046](#fn_3045) were offered both gifts and
sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as
pertaining to the conscience.” Thou seest now what is \[the meaning of\]
“The Law made nothing perfect,” ( [Heb. vii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019) <span id="v.xix-p38.5"></span> ,)
and “If that first \[covenant\] had been faultless.” ( [Heb. viii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#007) <span id="v.xix-p38.6"></span> .)
How? “As pertaining to the conscience.” For the sacrifices did not put
away  <span id="fr_3046"></span>[3047](#fn_3046) the defilement from the
soul, but still were concerned with the body: “after the law of a carnal
commandment.” ( [Heb. vii. 16](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#016) <span
id="v.xix-p39.5"></span> .) For certainly they could not put away  <span
id="fr_3047"></span>[3048](#fn_3047) adultery, nor murder, nor
sacrilege. Seest thou? Thou hast eaten this, Thou hast not eaten that,
which are matters of indifference. \[“Which stood\] only in meats and
drinks, and divers washings.” “Thou hast drunk this,” he says: and yet
nothing has been ordained concerning drink, but he said this, treating
them as trifles.  <span id="fr_3048"></span>[3049](#fn_3048)

<span id="v.xix-p42"></span> [Heb.
9.10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010)<span id="v.xix-p42.1"></span> .
“And \[in\] divers washings, and carnal ordinances imposed on them until
the <span id="page_440">p. 440</span> <span id="v.xix-Page_440"></span>
time of reformation.”  <span id="fr_3049"></span>[3050](#fn_3049) For
this is the righteousness of the flesh. Here he depreciates the
sacrifices, showing that they had no efficacy, and that they existed
“till the time of reformation,” that is, they waited for the time that
reformeth all things.

<span id="v.xix-p44"></span>\[4.\] [Heb.
9.11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011)<span id="v.xix-p44.1"></span> .
“But Christ being come an High Priest of good things that are come
 <span id="fr_3050"></span>[3051](#fn_3050) by a greater and more
perfect tabernacle not made with hands.” Here he means the flesh. And
well did he say, “greater and more perfect,” since God The Word and all
the power of The Spirit dwells therein; “For God giveth not the Spirit
by measure \[unto Him\].” ( [John iii.
34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034) <span id="v.xix-p45.7"></span> .)
And “more perfect,” as being both unblamable, and setting right greater
things.

<span id="v.xix-p46"></span>“That is, not of this creation.” See how
\[it was\] “greater.” For it would not have been “of the Spirit” (
[Matt. i. 20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020) <span
id="v.xix-p46.1"></span> ), if man had constructed it. Nor yet is it “of
this creation”; that is, not of these created things, but spiritual, of
 <span id="fr_3051"></span>[3052](#fn_3051) the Holy Ghost.

<span id="v.xix-p48"></span> Seest thou how he calls the body tabernacle
and veil and heaven.  <span id="fr_3052"></span>[3053](#fn_3052) “By a
greater and more perfect tabernacle. Through the veil, that is, His
flesh.” ( [Heb. x. 20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020) <span
id="v.xix-p49.17"></span> .) And again, “into that within the veil.” (
[Heb. vi. 19](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#019) <span
id="v.xix-p49.18"></span> .) And again, “entering into  <span
id="fr_3053"></span>[3054](#fn_3053) the Holy of Holies, to appear
before the face of God.” ( [Heb. ix.
24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024) <span id="v.xix-p50.5"></span> .)
Why then doth he this? According as one thing or a different one is
signified. I mean for instance, the Heaven is a veil, for as a veil it
walls off the Holy of Holies; the flesh \[is a veil\] hiding the
Godhead;  <span id="fr_3054"></span>[3055](#fn_3054) and the tabernacle
likewise holding the Godhead. Again, Heaven \[is\] a tabernacle: for the
Priest is there within.

<span id="v.xix-p52"></span> “But Christ” (he says) “being come an High
Priest ”: he did not say, “become,” but “being come,” that is, having
come for this very purpose, not having been successor to another. He did
not come first and then become \[High Priest\], but came and became at
the same time.  <span id="fr_3055"></span>[3056](#fn_3055) And he did
not say “being come an High Priest” of things which are sacrificed, but
“of good things that are come,” as if his discourse had not power to put
the whole before us.

<span id="v.xix-p54"></span> [Heb.
9.12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012)<span id="v.xix-p54.1"></span> .
“Neither by the blood,” he says, “of goats and calves” (All things are
changed) “but by His own Blood” (he says) “He entered in once for all
 <span id="fr_3056"></span>[3057](#fn_3056) into the Holy Place.” See
thus he called Heaven. “Once for all” (he says) “He entered into the
Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption.” And this \[expression\]
“having obtained,” was \[expressive\] of things very difficult, and that
are beyond expectation, how by one entering in, He “obtained everlasting
redemption.”

<span id="v.xix-p56"></span>\[5.\] Next \[comes\] that which is
calculated to persuade.

<span id="v.xix-p57"></span> [Heb.
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014)<span id="v.xix-p57.1"></span> .
“For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer
sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh; how
much more shall the Blood of Christ, who through the Holy  <span
id="fr_3057"></span>[3058](#fn_3057) Spirit offered Himself without spot
to God, purge your conscience from dead works, to serve the living God.”

<span id="v.xix-p59"></span> For (he says) if “the blood of bulls” is
able to purify the flesh, much rather shall the Blood of Christ wipe
away the defilement of the soul. For that thou mayest not suppose when
thou hearest \[the word\] “sanctifieth,” that it is some great thing, he
marks out  <span id="fr_3058"></span>[3059](#fn_3058) and shows the
difference between each of these purifyings, and how the one of them is
high and the other low. And says it is \[so\] with good reason, since
that is “the blood of bulls,” and this “the Blood of Christ.”

<span id="v.xix-p61"></span> Nor was he content with the name, but he
sets forth also the manner of the offering. “Who” (he says) “through the
Holy  <span id="fr_3059"></span>[3060](#fn_3059) Spirit offered Himself
without spot to God,” that is, the victim was without blemish, pure from
sins. For this is \[the meaning of\] “through the Holy Spirit,” not
through fire, nor through any other things.

<span id="v.xix-p63"></span>“Shall purge your conscience” (he says)
“from dead works.” And well said he “from dead works”; if any man
touched a dead body, he was polluted; and here, if any man touch a “dead
work,” he is defiled through his conscience. “To serve” (he says) “the
Living and true God.” Here he declares that it is not \[possible\] while
one has “dead works to serve the Living and true God,” for they are both
dead and false; and with good reason \[he says this\].

<span id="v.xix-p64"></span>\[6.\] Let no man then enter in here with
“dead works.” For if it was not fit that one should enter in who had
touched a dead body, much <span id="page_441">p. 441</span> <span
id="v.xix-Page_441"></span> more one that hath “dead works”: for this is
the most grievous pollution. And “dead works” are, all which have not
life, which breathe forth an ill odor. For as a dead body is useful to
none of the senses, but is even annoying to those who come near it, so
sin also at once strikes the reasoning faculty,  <span
id="fr_3060"></span>[3061](#fn_3060) and does not allow the
understanding itself to be calm, but disturbs and troubles it.

<span id="v.xix-p66"></span> And it is said too that a plague at its
very commencement corrupts  <span id="fr_3061"></span>[3062](#fn_3061)
the living bodies; such also is sin. It differs in nothing from a
plague, not \[indeed\] corrupting the air first, and then the bodies,
but darting at once into the soul. Seest thou not how persons affected
with the plague, are inflamed: how they writhe about, how they are full
of an ill scent, how disfigured are their countenances: how wholly
unclean they are? Such are they also that sin, though they see it not.
For, tell me, is not he who is possessed by the desire of riches or
carnal lust, worse than any one that is in a fever? Is he not more
unclean than all these, when he does and submits to all shameless
things?

<span id="v.xix-p68"></span>\[7.\] For what is baser than a man who is
in love with money? Whatever things women that are harlots or on the
stage refuse not to do neither does he \[refuse\]. Rather it is likely
that they would refuse \[to do\] a thing, rather than he. He even
submits to do things fit for slaves, flattering those whom he ought not;
again he is overbearing where he ought not to be, being inconsistent in
every respect. He will sit by flattering wicked people, and oftentimes
depraved old men, that are of much poorer and meaner condition than
himself; and will be insolent and overbearing to others that are good
and in all respects virtuous. Thou seest in both respects the baseness,
the shamelessness: he is both humble beyond measure, and boastful.

<span id="v.xix-p69"></span>Harlots however stand in front of their
house, and the charge against them is that they sell their body for
money: yet, one may say, poverty and hunger compel them (although at the
most this is no sufficient excuse: for they might gain a livelihood by
work). But the covetous man stands, not before his house, but before the
midst of the city, making over to the devil not his body but his soul;
so that he \[the devil\] is in his company, and goes in unto him, as
verily to a harlot: and having satisfied all his lusts departs; and all
the city sees it, not two or three persons only.

<span id="v.xix-p70"></span> And this again is the peculiarity of
harlots, that they are his who gives the gold. Even if he be a slave or
a gladiator,  <span id="fr_3062"></span>[3063](#fn_3062) or any person
whatever, yet if he offers their hire, they receive him. But the free,
even should they be more noble than all, they do not accept without the
money. These men also do the same. They turn away right thoughts when
they bring no money; but they associate with the abominable, and
actually with those that fight with wild beasts,  <span
id="fr_3063"></span>[3064](#fn_3063) for the sake of the gold, and
associate with them shamelessly and destroy the beauty of the soul. For
as those women are naturally of odious appearance  <span
id="fr_3064"></span>[3065](#fn_3064) and black, and awkward and gross,
and formless and ill-shaped, and in all respects disgusting, such do the
souls of these men become, not able to conceal their deformity by their
outward paintings.  <span id="fr_3065"></span>[3066](#fn_3065) For when
the ill look  <span id="fr_3066"></span>[3067](#fn_3066) is extreme,
whatever they may devise, they cannot succeed in their feigning.

<span id="v.xix-p76"></span>For that shamelessness makes harlots, hear
the prophet saying, “Thou wert shameless towards all; thou hadst a
harlot’s countenance.” ( [Jer. iii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003)
<span id="v.xix-p76.1"></span> .) This may be said to the covetous also:
“Thou wert shameless towards all,” not towards these or those, but
“towards all.” How? Such an one respects neither father, nor son, nor
wife, nor friend, nor brother, nor benefactor, nor absolutely any one.
And why do I say friend, and brother, and father? He respects not God
Himself, but all \[we believe\] seems to him a fable; and he laughs,
intoxicated by his great lust, and not even admitting into his ears any
of the things which might profit him.

<span id="v.xix-p77"></span>But O! their absurdity! and then what things
they say! “Woe to thee, O Mammon, and to him that has thee not.” At this
I am torn to pieces with indignation: for woe to those who say these
things, though they say them in jest. For tell me, has not God uttered
such a threat as this, saying, “Ye cannot serve two masters”? ( [Matt.
vi. 24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024) <span id="v.xix-p77.1"></span>
.) And dost thou set at nought  <span
id="fr_3067"></span>[3068](#fn_3067) the threat? Does not Paul say that
it is Idolatry, and does he not call “the covetous man an Idolater”? (
[Eph. v. 5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005) <span
id="v.xix-p78.3"></span> .)

<span id="v.xix-p79"></span> \[8.\] And thou standest laughing, raising
a laugh after the manner of women of the world who are on the stage.
This has overthrown, this has cast down everything. Our affairs,  <span
id="fr_3068"></span>[3069](#fn_3068) both our business  <span
id="fr_3069"></span>[3070](#fn_3069) and our politeness, are turned into
laughing; there is nothing steady, nothing grave. I say not these things
to men of the world only; but I know those whom I am hinting at. For the
Church has been filled with laughter. Whatever clever thing one may say,
immediately there <span id="page_442">p. 442</span> <span
id="v.xix-Page_442"></span> is laughter among those present: and the
marvelous thing is that many do not leave off laughing even during the
very time of the prayer.

<span id="v.xix-p82"></span> Everywhere the devil leads the dance,
 <span id="fr_3070"></span>[3071](#fn_3070) he has entered into all, is
master of all. Christ is dishonored, is thrust aside; the Church is made
no account of. Do ye not hear Paul saying, Let “filthiness and foolish
talking and jesting” ( [Eph. v. 4](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004)
<span id="v.xix-p83.2"></span> ) be put away from you? He places
“jesting” along with “filthiness,” and dost thou laugh? What is “foolish
talking”? that which has nothing profitable. And dost thou, a solitary,
laugh at all and relax thy countenance? thou that art crucified? thou
that art a mourner? tell me, dost thou laugh? Where dost thou hear of
Christ doing this? Nowhere: but that He was sad indeed oftentimes. For
even when He looked on Jerusalem, He wept; and when He thought on the
Traitor He was troubled; and when He was about to raise Lazarus, He
wept; and dost thou laugh? If he who grieves not over the sins of others
deserves to be accused, of what consideration will he be worthy, who is
without sorrow for his own sins, yea laughs at them? This is the season
of grief and tribulation, of bruising and bringing matter \[the body\],
of conflicts and sweatings, and dost thou laugh? Dost not thou see how
Sarah was rebuked? dost thou not hear Christ saying, “Woe to them that
laugh, for they shall weep”? ( [Luke vi.
25](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#025) <span id="v.xix-p83.3"></span> .)
Thou chantest these things every day, for, tell me, what dost thou say?
“I have laughed?” By no means; but what? “I labored in my groaning.” (
[Ps. vi. 6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006) <span
id="v.xix-p83.4"></span> .)

<span id="v.xix-p84"></span>But perchance there are some persons so
dissolute and silly as even during this very rebuke to laugh, because
forsooth we thus discourse about laughter. For indeed such is their
derangement, such their madness, that it does not feel the rebuke.

<span id="v.xix-p85"></span>The Priest of God is Standing, offering up
the prayer of all: and art thou laughing, having no fears? And while he
is offering up the prayers in trembling for thee, dost thou despise all?
Hearest thou not the Scripture saying, “Woe, ye despisers!” (cf. [Acts
13:41](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#041), [Hab.
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005)<span id="v.xix-p85.1"></span> );
dost thou not shudder? dost thou not humble thyself? Even when thou
enterest a royal palace, thou orderest thyself in dress, and look, and
gait, and all other respects: and here where there is the true Palace,
and things like those of heaven, dost thou laugh? Thou indeed, I know,
seest \[them\] not, but hear thou that there are angels present
everywhere, and in the house of God especially they stand by the King,
and all is filled by those incorporeal Powers.

<span id="v.xix-p86"></span>This my discourse is addressed to women
also, who in the presence of their husbands indeed do not dare readily
to do this, and even if they do it, it is not at all times, but during a
season of relaxation, but here they do it always. Tell me, O woman, dost
thou cover thine head and laugh, sitting in the Church? Didst thou come
in here to make confession of sins, to fall down before God, to entreat
and to supplicate for the transgressions thou hast wretchedly committed,
and dost thou do this with laughter? How then wilt thou be able to
propitiate Him?

<span id="v.xix-p87"></span> \[9.\] But (one says) what harm is there in
laughter? There is no harm in laughter; the harm is when it is beyond
measure, and out of season. Laughter has been implanted in us, that when
we see our friends after a long time, we may laugh; that when we see any
persons downcast and fearful, we may relieve them by our smile; not that
we should burst out violently  <span
id="fr_3071"></span>[3072](#fn_3071) and be always laughing. Laughter
has been implanted in our soul, that the soul may sometimes be
refreshed, not that it may be quite relaxed. For carnal desire also is
implanted in us, and yet it is not by any means necessary that because
it is implanted in us, therefore we should use it, or use it
immoderately: but we should hold it in subjection, and not say, Because
it is implanted in us, let us use it.

<span id="v.xix-p89"></span> Serve God with tears, that thou mayest be
able to wash away your sins. I know that many mock us,  <span
id="fr_3072"></span>[3073](#fn_3072) saying, “Tears directly.” Therefore
it is a time for tears. I know also that they are disgusted, who say,
“Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.” ( [1 Cor. xv.
32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032) <span id="v.xix-p90.2"></span> .)
“Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.” ( [Eccles. i.
2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#002) <span id="v.xix-p90.3"></span> .) It
is not I that say it, but he who had had the experience of all things
saith thus: “I builded for me houses, I planted vineyards, I made me
pools of water, \[I had\] men servants and women servants.” ( [Eccl.
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#004),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#006),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#007)<span id="v.xix-p90.4"></span> .)
And what then after all these things? “Vanity of vanities, all is
vanity.” ( [Eccles. xii. 8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#008) <span
id="v.xix-p90.5"></span> .)

<span id="v.xix-p91"></span>Let us mourn therefore, beloved, let us
mourn in order that we may laugh indeed, that we may rejoice indeed in
the time of unmixed joy. For with this joy \[here\] grief is altogether
mingled: and never is it possible to find it pure. But that is simple
and undeceiving joy: it has nothing treacherous, nor any admixture. In
that joy let us delight ourselves; that let us pursue after. And it is
not possible to obtain this in any other way, than by choosing here not
what is pleasant, but what is profitable, and being willing to be
afflicted a little, and bearing all things with thanksgiving. For thus
we shall be able to attain even to the Kingdom of Heaven, of which may
we all be counted worthy, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the
Father be glory, together with the Holy Ghost, now and for ever and
world without end. Amen.

<span id="v.xix-p49"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xix-p49.1"></span>A slight alteration of Mr. Field’s text seems
needed here. The text of the Homily which he gives in accordance with
all the authorities is: </span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xix-p49.2"></span>ὁ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xix-p49.3"></span>ρᾷς πῶς καὶ σκηνὴν καὶ καταπέτασμα καὶ οὐρανὸν
τὸ σῶμα καλεῖ</span> <span class="Greek"><span id="v.xix-p49.4"></span>.
But there is no appearance that the Apostle called Christ’s body heaven,
nor do any of the texts cited show it. If however, we introduce</span>
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.xix-p49.5"></span>καὶ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.xix-p49.6"></span>before</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.xix-p49.7"></span>τὸ σῶμα</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.xix-p49.8"></span>, or substitute it
for</span> <span class="Greek"><span id="v.xix-p49.9"></span>τὸ</span>
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.xix-p49.10"></span>, we have a good
sense, in accordance with the four texts cited by St Chrys. and the
explanations which he afterwards gives. \[The criticism of the English
editor is not without some force; yet it seems best to adhere to the
text of St. Chrys., as is here done. The proposed alteration does not
remove the difficulty, which is merely negative. The rendering in the
English edition is</span> “ <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xix-p49.11"></span>he calls heaven and the body both tabernacle
and veil.</span> ” <span class="Greek"><span
