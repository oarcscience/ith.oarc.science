<p class="c35"><a name="v.v-p2"></A> <a name="v.v-p2.1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="v.v-p2.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001">Heb. 1:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002">2</a><a name="v.v-p2.3"></A></span>   </p>    
<p class="c37"><a name="v.v-p3"></A> <i>&#8220;God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the Prophets, hath at the end of the days</i> &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2719"></A><A HREF="#fn_2719"><FONT SIZE="1">2720</FONT></A>
 <i>spoken unto us by His Son whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds.&#8221;</i></p>    
<p class="c17"><a name="v.v-p5"></A> [1.] <span class="c11"><a name="v.v-p5.1"></A>Truly</span> , &#8220;where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020"> Rom. v. 20 </a><a name="v.v-p5.2"></A> .) This at least the blessed Paul intimates here also, in the very beginning of his Epistle to the Hebrews. For since as it was likely that afflicted, worn out by evils, and judging of things thereby, they would think themselves worse off than all other men,&#8212;he shows that herein they had rather been made partakers of 	 greater, even very exceeding, grace; arousing the hearer at the very opening of his discourse. Wherefore he says, &#8220;God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the Prophets, hath at the end of the days spoken unto us by His Son.&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p6"></A>Why did he [Paul] not oppose &#8220;himself&#8221; to &#8220;the prophets&#8221;? Certainly, he was much greater than they, inasmuch as a greater trust was committed to him. Yet he doth not so. Why? First, to avoid speaking great things concerning himself. Secondly, because his hearers were not yet perfect. And thirdly, because he rather wished to exalt them, and to show that their superiority was great. As if he had said, What so great matter is it that He sent prophets to 	 our fathers? For to us [He has sent] His own only-begotten Son Himself.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p7"></A>And well did he begin thus, &#8220;At sundry times and in divers manners,&#8221; for he points out that not even the prophets themselves saw God; nevertheless, the Son saw Him. For the expressions, &#8220;at sundry times and in divers manners&#8221; are the same as &#8220;in different ways.&#8221; &#8220;For I&#8221; (saith He) &#8220;have multiplied visions, and used similitudes by the ministry of the Prophets.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#010"> Hos. xii. 10 </a><a name="v.v-p7.1"></A> .) Wherefore the excellency consists not in this 	 alone, that to them indeed prophets were sent, but to us the Son; but that none of them saw God, but the Only-begotten Son saw Him. He doth not indeed at once assert this, but by what he says afterwards he establishes it, when he speaks concerning His human nature; &#8220;For to which of the Angels said He, Thou art My Son,&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005">Heb. 1.5</a><a name="v.v-p7.2"></A> ), and, &#8220;Sit thou on My right hand&#8221;? ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013">Heb. 1.13</a><a name="v.v-p7.3"></A> .)</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p8"></A>And look on his great wisdom. First he shows the superiority from the prophets. Then having established this as acknowledged, he declares that to them indeed He spake by the prophets, but to us by the Only-begotten. Then [He spake] to them by Angels, and this again he establishes, with good reason (for angels also held converse with the Jews): yet even herein we have the superiority, inasmuch as the Master [spake] to us, but to them servants, and prophets, 	 fellow-servants.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p9"></A>[2.] Well also said he, &#8220;at the end of the days,&#8221; for by this he both stirs them up and encourages them desponding of the future. For as he says also in another place, &#8220;The Lord is at hand, be careful for nothing&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#005">Phil. 4:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006">6</a><a name="v.v-p9.1"></A> ), and again, &#8220;For now is our salvation nearer than when we believed&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#011"> Rom. xiii. 11 </a><a name="v.v-p9.2"></A> ): so also here. What then is it which he says? That whoever is spent in the conflict, 	 when he hears of the end thereof, recovers his breath a little, knowing that it is the end indeed of his labors, but the beginning of his rest.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p10"></A> &#8220;Hath in the end of the days spoken unto us in [His] Son.&#8221; Behold again he uses the saying, &#8220;in [His] Son,&#8221; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2720"></A><A HREF="#fn_2720"><FONT SIZE="1">2721</FONT></A>
 for &#8220;through the Son,&#8221; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2721"></A><A HREF="#fn_2721"><FONT SIZE="1">2722</FONT></A>
 against those who assert that this phrase is proper to the Spirit. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2722"></A><A HREF="#fn_2722"><FONT SIZE="1">2723</FONT></A>
  Dost thou see that the [word] &#8220;in&#8221; is &#8220;through&#8221;? &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2723"></A><A HREF="#fn_2723"><FONT SIZE="1">2724</FONT></A>
</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p15"></A>And the expression, &#8220;In times past,&#8221; and this, &#8220;In the end of the days,&#8221; shadows forth some other meaning:&#8212;that when a long time had intervened, when we were on the edge of punishment, when the Gifts had failed, when there was no expectation of deliverance, when we were expecting to have less than all&#8212;then we have had more.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p16"></A>And see how considerately he hath spoken it. For he said not, &#8220;Christ spake&#8221; (albeit it was He who did speak), but inasmuch as their souls were weak, and they were not yet able to hear the things concerning Christ, he says, &#8220;God hath spoken by Him.&#8221; What meanest thou? <A NAME="page_367"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 367</FONT></A> <a name="v.v-Page_367"></A> did God speak through the Son? Yes. What then? Is it thus thou showest the superiority? for here thou hast but pointed out that both the New and the Old [Covenants] are of One 	 and the same: and that this superiority is not great. Wherefore he henceforth follows on upon this argument, saying, &#8220;He spake unto us by [His] Son.&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p17"></A>(Note, how Paul makes common cause, and puts himself on a level with the disciples, saying, He spake &#8220;to us&#8221;: and yet He did not speak to him, but to the Apostles, and through them to the many. But he lifts them [the Hebrews] up, and declares that He spake also to them. And as yet he doth not at all reflect on the Jews. For almost all to whom the prophets spake, were a kind of evil and polluted persons. But as yet the discourse is not of these: but, 	 hitherto of the gifts derived from God.)</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p18"></A>&#8220;Whom He appointed,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;heir of all.&#8221; What is &#8220;whom He appointed heir of all&#8221;? He speaks here of the flesh [the human nature]. As He also says in the second Psalm, &#8220;Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008"> Ps. ii. 8 </a><a name="v.v-p18.1"></A> .) For no longer is &#8220;Jacob the portion of the Lord&#8221; nor &#8220;Israel His inheritance&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009"> Deut. xxxii. 9 </a><a name="v.v-p18.2"></A> ), but all men: that is to say, He hath made 	 Him Lord of all: which Peter also said in the Acts, &#8220;God hath made Him both Lord and Christ.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036"> Acts ii. 36 </a><a name="v.v-p18.3"></A> .) But he has used the name &#8220;Heir,&#8221; declaring two things: His proper sonship &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2724"></A><A HREF="#fn_2724"><FONT SIZE="1">2725</FONT></A>
 and His indefeasible sovereignty. &#8220;Heir of all,&#8221; that is, of all the world.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p20"></A> [3.] Then again he brings back his discourse to its former point. &#8220;By whom also He made the worlds [the ages].&#8221; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2725"></A><A HREF="#fn_2725"><FONT SIZE="1">2726</FONT></A>
  Where are those who say, There was [a time] when He was not?</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p22"></A>Then, using degrees of ascent, he uttered that which is far greater than all this, saying,</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p23"></A> <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003">Heb. 1:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004">4</a><a name="v.v-p23.1"></A> . &#8220;Who, (being the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power,) when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; being made &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2726"></A><A HREF="#fn_2726"><FONT SIZE="1">2727</FONT></A>
 so much better than the Angels as He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p25"></A>O! the wisdom of the Apostle! or rather, not the wisdom of Paul, but the grace of the Spirit is the thing to wonder at. For surely he uttered not these things of his own mind, nor in that way did he find his wisdom. (For whence could it be? From the knife, and the skins, or the workshop?) But it was from the working of God. For his own understanding did not give birth to these thoughts, which was then so mean and slender as in nowise to surpass the baser sort; 	 (for how could it, seeing it spent itself wholly on bargains and skins?) but the grace of the Spirit shows forth its strength by whomsoever it will.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p26"></A>For just as one, wishing to lead up a little child to some lofty place, reaching up even to the top of Heaven, does this gently and by degrees, leading him upwards by the steps from below,&#8212;then when he has set him on high, and bidden him to gaze downwards, and sees him turning giddy and confused, and dizzy, taking hold of him, he leads him down to the lower stand, allowing him to take breath; then when he hath recovered it, leads him up again, and again brings him 	 down;&#8212;just so did the blessed Paul likewise, both with the Hebrews and everywhere, having learnt it from his Master. For even He also did so; sometimes He led His hearers up on high, and sometimes He brought them down, not allowing them to remain very long.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p27"></A> See him, then, even here&#8212;by how many steps he led them up, and placed them near the very summit of religion, and then or ever they grow giddy, and are seized with dizziness, how he leads them again lower down, and allowing them to take breath, says, &#8220;He spake unto us by [His] Son,&#8221; &#8220;whom He appointed Heir of all things.&#8221; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2727"></A><A HREF="#fn_2727"><FONT SIZE="1">2728</FONT></A>
  For the name of Son is so far common. For where a true &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2728"></A><A HREF="#fn_2728"><FONT SIZE="1">2729</FONT></A>
 [Son] it is understood of, He is above all: but however that may be, for the present he proves that He is from above.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p30"></A>And see how he says it: &#8220;Whom He appointed,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;heir of all things.&#8221; The phrase, &#8220;He appointed Heir,&#8221; is humble. Then he placed them on the higher step, adding, &#8220;by whom also He made the worlds.&#8221; Then on a higher still, and after which there is no other, &#8220;who being the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His person.&#8221; Truly he has led them to unapproachable light, to the very brightness itself. And before they are 	 blinded see how he gently leads them down again, saying, &#8220;and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty.&#8221; He does not simply say, &#8220;He sat down,&#8221; but &#8220;after the purifying, He sat down,&#8221; for he hath touched on the Incarnation, and his utterance is again lowly.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p31"></A>Then again having said a little by the way (for he says, &#8220;on the right hand of the Majesty on high&#8221;), [he turns] again to what is lowly; &#8220;being made so much better than the angels, <A NAME="page_368"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 368</FONT></A> <a name="v.v-Page_368"></A> as He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.&#8221; Henceforward then he treats here of that which is according to the flesh, since the phrase &#8220;being made better&#8221; doth not express His essence according to the Spirit,  	 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2729"></A><A HREF="#fn_2729"><FONT SIZE="1">2730</FONT></A>
 (for that was not &#8220;made&#8221; but &#8220;begotten,&#8221;) but according to the flesh: for this was &#8220;made.&#8221; Nevertheless the discourse here is not about being called into &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2730"></A><A HREF="#fn_2730"><FONT SIZE="1">2731</FONT></A>
 existence. But just as John says, &#8220;He that cometh after me, is preferred before me&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015">John 1:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#030">30</a><a name="v.v-p33.5"></A> ), that is, higher in honor and esteem; so also here, &#8220;being made so much better than the angels&#8221;&#8212;that is, higher in esteem and better and more glorious, &#8220;by how much He hath obtained by inheritance a more excellent name than they.&#8221; Seest thou that he is speaking of that which is according to the flesh? For this Name,  	 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2731"></A><A HREF="#fn_2731"><FONT SIZE="1">2732</FONT></A>
 God the Word ever had; He did not afterwards &#8220;obtain it by inheritance&#8221;; nor did He afterwards become &#8220;better than the Angels, when He had purged our sins&#8221;; but He was always &#8220;better,&#8221; and better without all comparison. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2732"></A><A HREF="#fn_2732"><FONT SIZE="1">2733</FONT></A>
  For this is spoken of Him according to the flesh.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p36"></A>So truly it is our way also, when we talk of man, to speak things both high and low. Thus, when we say, &#8220;Man is nothing,&#8221; &#8220;Man is earth,&#8221; &#8220;Man is ashes,&#8221; we call the whole by the worse part. But when we say, &#8220;Man is an immortal animal,&#8221; and &#8220;Man is rational, and of kin to those on high,&#8221; we call again the whole by the better part. So also, in the case of Christ, sometimes Paul discourseth from the less and sometimes from the better; wishing both 	 to establish the economy, and also to teach about the incorruptible nature.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p37"></A>[4.] Since then &#8220;He hath purged our sins,&#8221; let us continue pure; and let us receive no stain, but preserve the beauty which He hath implanted in us, and His comeliness undefiled and pure, &#8220;not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027"> Eph. v. 27 </a><a name="v.v-p37.1"></A> .) Even little sins are &#8220;a spot and a wrinkle,&#8221; such a thing, I mean, as Reproach, Insult, Falsehood.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p38"></A>Nay, rather not even are these small, but on the contrary very great: yea so great as to deprive a man even of the kingdom of Heaven. How, and in what manner? &#8220;He that calleth his brother fool, is in danger&#8221; (He saith) &#8220;of hellfire.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022"> Matt. v. 22 </a><a name="v.v-p38.1"></A> .) But if it be so with him who calls a man &#8220;fool,&#8221; which seems to be the slightest of all things, and rather mere children&#146;s talk; what sentence of punishment will not he incur, who 	 calleth him malignant and crafty and envious, and casteth at him ten thousand other reproaches? What more fearful than this?</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p39"></A> Now suffer, I beseech you, the word [of exhortation]. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2733"></A><A HREF="#fn_2733"><FONT SIZE="1">2734</FONT></A>
  For if he that &#8220;doeth&#8221; [aught] to &#8220;one of the least, doeth it to Him&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#040"> Matt. xxv. 40 </a><a name="v.v-p40.6"></A> ), and he that &#8220;doeth it not to one of the least doeth it not to Him&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#045"> Matt. xxv. 45 </a><a name="v.v-p40.7"></A> ), how is it not the same also in the matter of good or evil speaking? He that reviles his brother, reviles God: and he that honors his brother, honors God. Let us train therefore our tongue to speak good words. For &#8220;refrain,&#8221; it 	 is said, &#8220;thy tongue from evil.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#013"> Ps. xxxiv. 13 </a><a name="v.v-p40.8"></A> .) For God gave it not that we should speak evil, that we should revile, that we should calumniate one another; but to sing hymns to God withal, to speak those things which &#8220;give grace to the hearers&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029"> Eph. iv. 29 </a><a name="v.v-p40.9"></A> ), things for edification, things for profit.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p41"></A>Hast thou spoken evil of a man? What is thy gain, entangling thyself in mischief together with him? For thou hast obtained the reputation of a slanderer. For there is not any, no not any evil, which stops at him that suffers it, but it includes the doer also. As for instance, the envious person seems indeed to plot against another, but himself first reaps the fruit of his sin, wasting and wearing himself away, and being hated of all men. The cheat deprives 	 another of his money; yea and himself too of men&#146;s good will: and causes himself to be evil spoken of by all men. Now reputation is much better than money, for the one it is not easy to wash out, whereas it is easy to gain possession of the other. Or rather, the absence of the one doth no hurt to him that wanteth it; but the absence of the other makes you reproached and ridiculed, and an object of enmity and warfare to all.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p42"></A>The passionate man again first punishes and tears himself in pieces, and then him with whom he is angry.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p43"></A>Just so the evil speaker disgraces first himself and then him who is evil-spoken of: or, it may be, even this hath proved beyond his power, and while he departs with the credit of a foul and detestable kind of person, he causes the other to be loved the more. For when a man hearing a bad name given him, doth not requite the giver in the same kind, but praises and admires, he doth not praise the other, but himself. For I before observed that, as calumnies against our 	 neighbors first touch those who de <A NAME="page_369"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 369</FONT></A> <a name="v.v-Page_369"></A> vise the mischief, so also good works done towards our neighbors, gladden first those who do them. The parent either of good, or evil, justly reaps the fruit of it first himself. And just as water, whether it be brackish or sweet, fills the vessels of those who resort to it, but lessens not the fountain which sends it forth; so surely also, both wickedness and virtue, from whatever person they proceed, prove either his joy or his ruin.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p44"></A>So far as to the things of this world; but what speech may recount the things of that world, either the goods or the evils? There is none. For as to the blessings, they surpass all thought, not speech only; for their opposites are expressed indeed in terms familiar to us. For fire, it is said, is there, and darkness, and bonds, and a worm that never dieth. But this represents not only the things which are spoken of, but others more intolerable. And to convince 	 thee, consider at once this first: if it be fire, how is it also darkness? Seest thou how that fire is more intolerable than this? For it hath no light. If it be fire, how is it forever burning? Seest thou how something more intolerable than this happens? For it is not quenched. Yea, therefore it is called unquenchable. Let us then consider how great a misery it must be, to be forever burning, and to be in darkness, and to utter unnumbered groanings, and to gnash the teeth, and 	 not even to be heard. For if here any one of those ingeniously brought up, should he be cast into prison, speaks of the mere ill savor, and the being laid in darkness, and the being bound with murderers, as more intolerable than any death: think what it is when we are burning with the murderers of the whole world, neither seeing nor being seen, but in so vast a multitude thinking that we are alone. For the darkness and gloom doth not allow our distinguishing those who are near to us, but 	 each will burn as if he were thus suffering alone. Moreover, if darkness of itself afflicteth and terrifieth our souls, how then will it be when together with the darkness there are likewise so great pains and burnings?</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p45"></A>Wherefore I entreat you to be ever revolving these things with yourselves, and to submit to the pain of the words, that we may not undergo the punishment of the things. For assuredly, all these things shall be, and those whose doings have deserved those chambers of torture no man shall rescue, not father, nor mother, nor brother. &#8220;For a brother redeemeth not,&#8221; He saith; &#8220;shall a man redeem?&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#007"> Ps. xlix. 7 </a><a name="v.v-p45.1"></A> , LXX.), though he have much 	 confidence, though he have great power with God. For it is He Himself who rewards every one according to his works, and upon these depends our salvation or punishment.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p46"></A>Let us make then to ourselves &#8220;friends of the mammon of unrighteousness&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#009"> Luke xvi. 9 </a><a name="v.v-p46.1"></A> ), that is: Let us give alms; let us exhaust our possessions upon them, that so we may exhaust that fire: that we may quench it, that we may have boldness there. For there also it is not they who receive us, but our own work: for that it is not simply their being our friends which can save us, learn from what is added. For why did He not say, &#8220;Make 	 to yourselves friends, that they may receive you into their everlasting habitations,&#8221; but added also the manner? For saying, &#8220;of the mammon of unrighteousness,&#8221; He points out that we must make friends of them by means of our possessions, showing that mere friendship will not protect us, unless we have good works, unless we spend righteously the wealth unrighteously gathered.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p47"></A>Moreover, this our discourse, of Almsgiving I mean, fits not only the rich, but also the needy. Yea even if there be any person who supporteth himself by begging, even for him is this word. For there is no one, so poverty-stricken, however exceeding poor he may be, as not to be able to provide &#8220;two mites.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#002"> Luke xxi. 2 </a><a name="v.v-p47.1"></A> .) &#160;It is therefore possible that a person giving a small sum from small means, should surpass those who have large 	 possessions and give more; as that widow did. For not by the measure of what is given, but by the means and willingness of the givers is the extent of the alms-deed estimated. In all cases the will is needed, in all, a right disposition; in all, love towards God. If with this we do all things, though having little we give little, God will not turn away His face, but will receive it as great and admirable: for He regards the will, not the gifts: and if He see that to be great, He 	 assigneth His decrees and judges accordingly, and maketh them partakers of His everlasting benefits.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="v.v-p48"></A>Which may God grant us all to obtain, by the grace and love of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor, now and for ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>
