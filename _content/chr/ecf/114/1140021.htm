<p class="c35"><a name="iv.xviii-p2"></A> <a name="iv.xviii-p2.1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="iv.xviii-p2.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019">John i. 19</a><a name="iv.xviii-p2.3"></A></span>   </p>    
<p class="c36"><a name="iv.xviii-p3"></A>&#8220;And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c17"><a name="iv.xviii-p4"></A> [1.] <span class="c11"><a name="iv.xviii-p4.1"></A>A dreadful</span> thing is envy, beloved, a dreadful thing and a pernicious, to the enviers, not to the envied. For it harms and wastes them first, like some mortal venom deeply seated in their souls; and if by chance it injure its objects, the harm it does is small and trifling, and such as brings greater gain than loss. Indeed not in the case of envy only, but in every other, it is not he that has suffered, but he that has done the 	 wrong, who receives injury. For had not this been so, Paul would not have enjoined the disciples rather to endure wrong than to inflict it, when he says, &#8220;Why do ye not rather take wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#007"> 1 Cor. vi. 7 </a><a name="iv.xviii-p4.2"></A> .) Well he knew, that destruction ever follows, not the injured party, but the injuring. All this I have said, by reason of the envy of the Jews. Because those who had flocked from the cities to 	 John, and had condemned their own sins, and caused themselves to be baptized, repenting as it were after Baptism, send to ask him, &#8220;Who art thou?&#8221; Of a truth they were the offspring of vipers, serpents, and even worse if possible than this. O evil and adulterous and perverse generation, after having been baptized, do ye then become vainly curious, and question about the Baptist? What folly can be greater than this of yours? How was it that ye came forth? that ye confessed your sins, 	 that ye ran to the Baptist? How was it that you asked him what you must do? when in all <A NAME="page_54"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 54</FONT></A> <a name="iv.xviii-Page_54"></A> this you were acting unreasonably, since you knew not the principle and purpose of his coming. Yet of this the blessed John said nothing, nor does he charge or reproach them with it, but answers them with all gentleness.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p5"></A>It is worth while to learn why he did thus. It was, that their wickedness might be manifest and plain to all men. Often did John testify of Christ to the Jews, and when he baptized them he continually made mention of Him to his company, and said, &#8220;I indeed baptize you with water, but there cometh One after me who is mightier than I; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011"> Matt. iii. 11 </a><a name="iv.xviii-p5.1"></A> .) With regard to him they 	 were affected by a human feeling; for, tremblingly attentive &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_424"></A><A HREF="#fn_424"><FONT SIZE="1">425</FONT></A>
 to the opinion of the world, and looking to &#8220;the outward appearance&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#007"> 2 Cor. x. 7 </a><a name="iv.xviii-p6.2"></A> ), they deemed it an unworthy thing that he should be subject to Christ. Since there were many things that pointed out John for an illustrious person. In the first place, his distinguished and noble descent; for he was the son of a chief priest. Then his conversation, his austere mode of life, his contempt of all human things; for despising dress and 	 table, and house and food itself, he had passed his former time in the desert. In the case of Christ all was the contrary of this. His family was mean, (as they often objected to Him, saying, &#8220;Is not this the carpenter&#146;s son? Is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren James and Joses?&#8221;) ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055"> Matt. xiii. 55 </a><a name="iv.xviii-p6.3"></A> ); and that which was supposed to be His country was held in such evil repute, that even Nathanael said, &#8220;Can there any good thing come out of 	 Nazareth?&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046">John 1.46</a><a name="iv.xviii-p6.4"></A> .) His mode of living was ordinary, and His garments not better than those of the many. For He was not girt with a leathern girdle, nor was His raiment of hair, nor did He eat honey and locusts. But He fared like all others, and was present at the feasts of wicked men and publicans, that He might draw them to Him. Which thing the Jews not understanding reproached Him with, as He also saith Himself, &#8220;The Son of Man came 	 eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019"> Matt. xi. 19 </a><a name="iv.xviii-p6.5"></A> .) When then John continually sent them from himself to Jesus, who seemed to them a meaner person, being ashamed and vexed at this, and wishing rather to have him for their teacher, they did not dare to say so plainly, but send to him, thinking by their flattery to induce him to confess that he was the Christ. They do not therefore send to 	 him mean men, as in the case of Christ, for when they wished to lay hold on Him, they sent servants, and then Herodians, and the like, but in this instance, &#8220;priests and Levites,&#8221; and not merely &#8220;priests,&#8221; but those &#8220;from Jerusalem,&#8221; that is, the more honorable; for the Evangelist did not notice this without a cause. And they send to ask, &#8220;Who art thou?&#8221; Yet the manner of his birth was well known to all, so that all said, &#8220;What manner of child shall this be?&#8221; ( 	 <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#066"> Luke i. 66 </a><a name="iv.xviii-p6.6"></A> ); and the report had gone forth into all the hill country. And afterwards when he came to Jordan, all the cities were set on the wing, and came to him from Jerusalem, and from all Jud&aelig;a, to be baptized. Why then do they &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_425"></A><A HREF="#fn_425"><FONT SIZE="1">426</FONT></A>
 now ask? Not because they did not know him, (how could that be, when he had been made manifest in so many ways?) but because they wished to bring him to do that which I have mentioned.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p8"></A>[2.] Hear then how this blessed person answered to the intention with which they asked the question, not to the question itself. When they said, &#8220;Who art thou?&#8221; he did not at once give them what would have been the direct answer, &#8220;I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness.&#8221; But what did he? He removed the suspicion they had formed; for, saith the Evangelist, being asked, &#8220;Who art thou?&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p9"></A> <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#020">John 1.20</a><a name="iv.xviii-p9.1"></A> . &#8220;He confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p10"></A> Observe the wisdom of the Evangelist. He mentions this for the third time, to set forth the excellency of the Baptist, and their wickedness and folly. And Luke also says, that when the multitudes supposed him to be the Christ, he again removes their suspicion. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_426"></A><A HREF="#fn_426"><FONT SIZE="1">427</FONT></A>
  This is the part of an honest servant, not only not to take to himself his master&#146;s honor, but also to reject it &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_427"></A><A HREF="#fn_427"><FONT SIZE="1">428</FONT></A>
 when given to him by the many. But the multitudes arrived at this supposition from simplicity and ignorance; these questioned him from an ill intention, which I have mentioned, expecting, as I said, to draw him over to their purpose by their flattery. Had they not expected this, they would not have proceeded immediately to another question, but would have been angry with him for having given them an answer foreign to their enquiry, and would have said, &#8220;Why, did we 	 suppose that? did we come to ask thee that?&#8221; But now as taken and detected in the fact, they proceed to another question, and say,</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p13"></A> <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021">John 1.21</a><a name="iv.xviii-p13.1"></A> . &#8220;What then? art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not.&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p14"></A>For they expected that Elias also would come, as Christ declares; for when His disciples enquired, &#8220;How then do the scribes say that Elias must first come?&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#010"> Matt. xvii. 10 </a><a name="iv.xviii-p14.1"></A> ) He replied, &#8220;Elias truly shall first come, and restore all <A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A> <a name="iv.xviii-Page_55"></A> things.&#8221; Then they ask, &#8220;Art thou that prophet? and he answered, No.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#010"> Matt. xvii. 10 </a><a name="iv.xviii-p14.2"></A> .) Yet surely he was a prophet. Wherefore then doth he deny it? Because 	 again he looks to the intention of his questioners. For they expected that some especial prophet should come, because Moses said, &#8220;The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet of thy brethren like unto me, unto Him shall ye harken.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015"> Deut. xviii. 15 </a><a name="iv.xviii-p14.3"></A> .) Now this was Christ. Wherefore they do not say, &#8220;Art thou a prophet?&#8221; meaning thereby one of the ordinary prophets; but the expression, &#8220;Art thou the prophet?&#8221; with the addition of the article, 	 means, &#8220;Art thou that Prophet who was foretold by Moses?&#8221; and therefore he denied not that he was a prophet, but that he was &#8220;that Prophet.&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p15"></A> <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#022">John 1.22</a><a name="iv.xviii-p15.1"></A> . &#8220;Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p16"></A>Observe them pressing him more vehemently, urging him, repeating their questions, and not desisting; while he first kindly removes false opinions concerning himself, and then sets before them one which is true. For, saith he,</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p17"></A> <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#023">John 1.23</a><a name="iv.xviii-p17.1"></A> . &#8220;I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p18"></A>When he had spoken some high and lofty words concerning Christ, as if (replying) to their opinion, he immediately betook himself to the Prophet to draw from thence confirmation of his assertion.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p19"></A> <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#024">John 1:24</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#025">25</a><a name="iv.xviii-p19.1"></A> . &#8220;And [saith the Evangelist] they who were sent were of the Pharisees. And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, neither Elias, neither that Prophet?&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p20"></A> Seest thou not without reason I said that they wished to bring him to this? and the reason why they did not at first say so was, lest they should be detected by all men. And then when he said, &#8220;I am not the Christ,&#8221; they, being desirous to conceal what they were plotting &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_428"></A><A HREF="#fn_428"><FONT SIZE="1">429</FONT></A>
 within, go on to &#8220;Elias,&#8221; and &#8220;that Prophet.&#8221; But when he said that he was not one of these either, after that, in their perplexity, they cast aside the mask, and without any disguise show clearly their treacherous intention, saying, &#8220;Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ?&#8221; And then again, wishing to throw some obscurity over the thing, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_429"></A><A HREF="#fn_429"><FONT SIZE="1">430</FONT></A>
 they add the others also, &#8220;Elias,&#8221; and &#8220;that Prophet.&#8221; For when they were not able to trip &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_430"></A><A HREF="#fn_430"><FONT SIZE="1">431</FONT></A>
 him by their flattery, they thought that by an accusation they could compel him &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_431"></A><A HREF="#fn_431"><FONT SIZE="1">432</FONT></A>
 to say the thing that was not.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p25"></A> What folly, what insolence, what ill-timed officiousness! Ye were sent to learn who and whence he might be, not to &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_432"></A><A HREF="#fn_432"><FONT SIZE="1">433</FONT></A>
 lay down laws for him also. This too was the conduct of men who would compel him to confess himself to be the Christ. Still not even now is he angry, nor does he, as might have been expected, say to them anything of this sort, &#8220;Do you give orders and make laws for me?&#8221; but again shows great gentleness towards them.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p27"></A> <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#026">John 1:26</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#027">27</a><a name="iv.xviii-p27.1"></A> . &#8220;I,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not; He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe&#146;s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.&#8221;</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p28"></A> [3.] What could the Jews have left to say to this? for even from this the accusation against them cannot be evaded, the decision against them admits not of pardon, they have given sentence against themselves. How? In what way? They deemed John worthy of credit, and so truthful, that they might believe him not only when he testified of others, but also when he spoke concerning himself. For had they not been so disposed, they would not have sent to learn 	 from him what related to himself. Because you know that the only persons whom we believe, especially when speaking of themselves, are those whom we suppose to be more veracious than any others. And it is not this alone which closes their mouths, but also the disposition with which they had approached him; for they came forth to him at first with great eagerness, even though afterwards they altered. Both which things Christ declared, when He said, &#8220;He was a burning (and a shining) light, 	 and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.&#8221; Moreover, his answer made him yet more worthy of credit. For (Christ) saith, &#8220;He that seeketh not his own glory, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_433"></A><A HREF="#fn_433"><FONT SIZE="1">434</FONT></A>
 the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.&#8221; Now this man sought it not, but refers the Jews to another. And those who were sent were of the most trustworthy among them, and of the highest rank, so that they could have in no way any refuge or excuse, for the unbelief which they exhibited towards Christ. Wherefore did ye not receive the things spoken concerning Him by John? you sent men who held the first rank among you, you enquired by them, you heard what the 	 Baptist answered, they manifested all possible officiousness, sought into every point, named all the persons you suspected him to be; and yet most publicly and plainly he confessed that he was neither &#8220;Christ,&#8221; nor &#8220;Elias&#8221; nor &#8220;that Prophet.&#8221; Nor did he stop even there, but also informed them who he was, and spoke of the nature of his own baptism, that it was but a slight and mean thing, nothing <A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A> <a name="iv.xviii-Page_56"></A> more than some water, and told of the superiority of the Baptism 	 given by Christ; he also cited Esaias the prophet, testifying of old very long ago, and calling Christ &#8220;Lord&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003"> Isa. xl. 3 </a><a name="iv.xviii-p29.2"></A> ), but giving him the names of &#8220;minister and servant.&#8221; What after this ought they to have done? Ought they not to have believed on Him who was witnessed of, to have worshiped Him, to have confessed Him to be God? For the character and heavenly wisdom of the witness showed that his testimony proceeded, not from flattery, but from 	 truth; which is plain also from this, that no man prefers his neighbor to himself, nor, when he may lawfully give honor to himself, will yield it up to another, especially when it is so great as that of which we speak. So that John would not have renounced &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_434"></A><A HREF="#fn_434"><FONT SIZE="1">435</FONT></A>
 this testimony (as belonging) to Christ, had He not been God. For though he might have rejected it for himself as being too great for his own nature, yet he would not have assigned it to another nature that was beneath it.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p31"></A> &#8220;But there standeth One among you, whom ye know not.&#8221; Reasonable it was that Christ should mingle among the people as one of the many, because everywhere He taught men not to be puffed up and boastful. And in this place by &#8220;knowledge&#8221; the Baptist means a perfect acquaintance with Him, who and whence He was. &#160;And immediately next to this he puts, &#8220;Who cometh after me&#8221;; all but saying, &#8220;Think not that all is contained in my baptism, for had that 	 been perfect, Another would not have arisen after me to offer you a different One, but this of mine is a preparation and a clearing the way for that other. Mine is but a shadow and image, but One must come who shall add to this the reality. So that His very coming &#145;after me&#146; especially declares His dignity: for had the first been perfect, no place would have been required for a second.&#8221; &#8220;Is &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_435"></A><A HREF="#fn_435"><FONT SIZE="1">436</FONT></A>
 before me,&#8221; is more honorable, brighter. And then, lest they should imagine that His superiority was found by comparison, desiring to establish His incomparableness, he says, &#8220;Whose shoe&#146;s latchet I am not worthy to unloose&#8221;; that is, who is not simply &#8220;before me,&#8221; but before me in such a way, that I am not worthy to be numbered among the meanest of His servants. For to loose the shoe is the office of humblest service.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p33"></A>Now if John was not worthy to &#8220;unloose the latchet&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#011"> Matt. xi. 11 </a><a name="iv.xviii-p33.1"></A> ), John, than whom &#8220;among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater,&#8221; where shall we rank ourselves? If he who was equal to, or rather greater than, all the world, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_436"></A><A HREF="#fn_436"><FONT SIZE="1">437</FONT></A>
 (for saith Paul, &#8220;the world was not worthy&#8221; of them&#8212; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#038"> Heb. xi. 38 </a><a name="iv.xviii-p34.2"></A> ,) declares himself not worthy to be reckoned even among the meanest of those who should minister unto Him, what shall we say, who are full of ten thousand sins, and are as far from the excellence of John, as earth from heaven.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p35"></A> [4.] He then saith that he himself is not &#8220;worthy so much as to unloose the latchet of His shoe&#8221;; while the enemies of the truth are mad with such a madness, as to assert &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_437"></A><A HREF="#fn_437"><FONT SIZE="1">438</FONT></A>
 that they are worthy to know Him even as He knows Himself. What is worse than such insanity, what more frenzied than such arrogance? Well hath a wise man said, &#8220;The beginning of pride is not to know the Lord.&#8221; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_438"></A><A HREF="#fn_438"><FONT SIZE="1">439</FONT></A>
</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p38"></A> The devil would not have been brought down and become a devil, not being a devil before, had he not been sick of this disease. This it was that cast him out from that confidence, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_439"></A><A HREF="#fn_439"><FONT SIZE="1">440</FONT></A>
 this sent him to the pit of fire, this was the cause of all his woes. For it is enough of itself to destroy every excellence of the soul, whether it find almsgiving, or prayer, or fasting, or anything. For, saith the Evangelist, &#8220;That which is highly esteemed among men is impure before the Lord.&#8221; ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#015"> Luke xvi. 15 </a><a name="iv.xviii-p39.2"></A> &#8212;not quoted exactly.) Therefore it is not only fornication or adultery that are wont to defile those who practice them, but 	 pride also, and that far more than those vices. Why? Because fornication though it is an unpardonable sin, yet a man may plead the desire; but pride cannot possibly find any cause or pretext of any sort whatever by which to obtain so much as a shadow of excuse; it is nothing but a distortion and most grievous disease of the soul, produced from no other source but folly. For there is nothing more foolish than a proud man, though he be surrounded with wealth, though he possess much of the 	 wisdom of this world, though he be set in royal place, though he bear about with all things that among men appear desirable.</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p40"></A>For if the man who is proud of things really good is wretched and miserable, and loses the reward of all those things, must not he who is exalted by things that are nought, and puffs himself up because of a shadow or the flower of the grass, (for such is this world&#146;s glory,) be more ridiculous than any, when he does just as some poor needy man might do, pining all his time with hunger, yet if ever he should chance one night to see a dream of good fortune, filled with 	 conceit because of it?</p>    
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.xviii-p41"></A>O wretched and miserable! when thy soul is perishing by a most grievous disease, when thou art poor with utter poverty, art thou high-minded because thou hast such and such a number of talents of gold? because thou hast a multitude of slaves and cattle? Yet these are not thine; <A NAME="page_57"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 57</FONT></A> <a name="iv.xviii-Page_57"></A> and if thou dost not believe my words, learn from the experience of those who have gone before &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_440"></A><A HREF="#fn_440"><FONT SIZE="1">441</FONT></A>
 thee. And if thou art so drunken, that thou canst not be instructed even from what has befallen others, wait a little, and thou shalt know by what befalls thyself that these things avail thee nothing, when gasping for life, and master not of a single hour, not even of a little moment, thou shalt unwillingly leave them &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_441"></A><A HREF="#fn_441"><FONT SIZE="1">442</FONT></A>
 to those who are about thee, and these perhaps those whom thou wouldest not. For many have not been permitted even to give directions concerning them, but have departed suddenly, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_442"></A><A HREF="#fn_442"><FONT SIZE="1">443</FONT></A>
 desiring to enjoy them, but not permitted, dragged from them, and forced to yield them up to others, giving place by compulsion to those to whom they would not. That this be not our case, let us, while we are yet in strength and health, send forward our riches hence to our own city, for thus only and in no other way shall we be able to enjoy them; so shall we lay them up in a place inviolate and safe. For there is nothing, there is nothing there that can take them from us; 	 no death, no attested wills, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_443"></A><A HREF="#fn_443"><FONT SIZE="1">444</FONT></A>
 no successors to inheritances, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_444"></A><A HREF="#fn_444"><FONT SIZE="1">445</FONT></A>
 no false informations, no plottings against us, but he who has departed hence bearing away great wealth with him may enjoy it there for ever. Who then is so wretched as not to desire to revel in riches which are his own throughout? Let us then transfer our wealth, and remove it thither. We shall not need for such a removal asses, or camels, or carriages, or ships, (God hath relieved even us from this difficulty,) but we only want the poor, the lame, the crippled, the 	 infirm. These are entrusted with this transfer, these convey our riches to heaven, these introduce the masters of such wealth as this to the inheritance of goods everlasting. Which may it be that we all attain through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>
