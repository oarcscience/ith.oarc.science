class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lxx-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"Though the Apostle Paul says, ‘I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord,
beseech you, brethren, that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye
are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering,
forbearing one another in love; endeavoring to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace.’" <span

<span id="v.v.iv.lxx-p3"></span>156.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxx-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  If you would not
only say these words, but hearken to them as well, you would put up even
with known evils for the sake of peace, instead of inventing new ones
for the sake of quarreling, if it were only because you subsequently
learned, for the sake of the peace of Donatus, to put up with the most
flagrant and notorious wickedness of Optatus.  What madness is this that
you display?  Those who are known are borne with, that a fragment may
not be further split up; those of whom nothing is known are defamed,
that they themselves may not remain in the undivided whole.
