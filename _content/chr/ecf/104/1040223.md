id="iv.x.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39.—Fire is Called Eternal, Not as God
Is, But Because Without End.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xli-p2"></span>But fire is eternal, not as God is
eternal, because, though without end, yet is not without beginning; but
God is also without beginning.  Then, although it may be employed
perpetually for the punishment of sinners, yet it is mutable nature. 
But that is true eternity which is true immortality, that is that
highest immutability, which cannot be changed at all.  For it is one
thing not to suffer change, when change is possible, and another thing
to be absolutely incapable of change.  Therefore, just as man is called
good, yet not as God, of whom it was said, "There is none good save God
alone;" <span id="fr_1130"></span>[1131](#fn_1130) and just as the soul
is called immortal, yet not as God, of whom it was said, "Who alone hath
immortality;" <span id="fr_1131"></span>[1132](#fn_1131) and just as a
man is called wise, yet not as God, of whom it was said, "To God the
only wise;" <span id="fr_1132"></span>[1133](#fn_1132) so fire is called
eternal, yet not as God, whose alone is immortality itself and true
eternity.
