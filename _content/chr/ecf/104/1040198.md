<span id="iv.x.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.x.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Small Good Things in Comparison
with Greater are Called by Contrary Names.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xvi-p2"></span>But in all these things, whatever are
small are called by contrary names in comparison with greater things; as
in the form of a man <span id="page_354">p. 354</span> <span
id="iv.x.xvi-Page_354"></span>because the beauty is greater, the beauty
of the ape in comparison with it is called deformity.  And the imprudent
are deceived, as if the former is good, and the latter evil, nor do they
regard in the body of the ape its own fashion, the equality of members
on both sides, the agreement of parts, the protection of safety, and
other things which it would be tedious to enumerate.
