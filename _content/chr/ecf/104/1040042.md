<span id="iv.iv.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—Popular Renown and
Inquisitiveness are Condemned in the Sacred Scriptures.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xxiii-p2"></span>38.  Popular renown is thus slighted
and scorned in the New Testament:  "If I wished," says St. Paul, "to
please men, I should not be the servant of Christ." <span
id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102)   Again, there is another production
of the soul formed by imaginations derived from material things, and
called the knowledge of things.  In reference to this we are fitly
warned against inquisitiveness to correct which is the great function of
temperance.  Thus it is said, "Take heed lest any one seduce you by
philosophy."  And because the word philosophy originally means the love
and pursuit of wisdom, a thing of great value and to be sought with the
whole mind, the apostle, with great prudence, that he might not be
thought to deter from the love of wisdom, has added the words, "And the
elements of this world." <span id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103)   For
some people, neglecting virtues, and ignorant of what God is, and of the
majesty of nature which remains always the same, think that they are
engaged in an important business when searching with the greatest
inquisitiveness and eagerness into this material mass which we call the
world.  This begets so much pride, that they look upon themselves as
inhabitants of the heaven of which they often discourse.  The soul,
then, which purposes to keep itself chaste for God must refrain from the
desire of vain knowledge like this.  For this desire usually produces
delusion, so that the soul thinks that nothing exists but what is
material; or if, from regard to authority, it confesses that there is an
immaterial existence, it can think of it only under material images, and
has no belief regarding it but that imposed by the bodily sense.  We may
apply to this the precept about fleeing from idolatry.

<span id="iv.iv.xxiii-p5"></span>39.  To this New Testament authority,
requiring us not to love anything in this world, <span
id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104) especially in that passage where it is
said, "Be not conformed to this world," <span
id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105) —for the point is to show that a man
is conformed to whatever he loves,—to this authority, then, if I seek
for a parallel passage in the Old Testament, I find several; but there
is one book of Solomon, called Ecclesiastes, which at great length
brings all earthly things into utter contempt.  The book begins thus: 
"Vanity of the vain, saith the Preacher, vanity of the vain; all is
vanity.  What profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh under
the sun?"  <span id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106)   If all these words
are considered, weighed, and thoroughly examined, many things are found
of essential importance to those who seek to flee from the world and to
take shelter in God; but this requires time and our discourse hastens on
to other topics.  But, after this beginning, he goes on to show in
detail that the vain <span id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107) are those
who are deceived by things of this sort; and he calls this which
deceives them vanity,—not that God did not create those things, but
because men choose to subject themselves by their sins to those things,
which the divine law has made subject to them in well-doing.  For when
you consider things beneath your<span id="page_53">p. 53</span> <span
id="iv.iv.xxiii-Page_53"></span>self to be admirable and desirable, what
is this but to be cheated and misled by unreal goods?  The man, then,
who is temperate in such mortal and transient things has his rule of
life confirmed by both Testaments, that he should love none of these
things, nor think them desirable for their own sakes, but should use
them as far as is required for the purposes and duties of life, with the
moderation of an employer instead of the ardor of a lover.  These
remarks on temperance are few in proportion to the greatness of the
theme, but perhaps too many in view of the task on hand.
