<p class="c38"><a name="iv.x.xxxiii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="iv.x.xxxiii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 31.&#8212;To Punish and to Forgive Sins Belong Equally to God.</span></p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.xxxiii-p2"></A>Likewise because it belongs to divine judgment, not human, what sort of punishment and how great is due to every fault, it is thus written:&#160; "O the height of the riches of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how inscrutable are His judgments and his ways past finding out!"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1111"></A><A HREF="#fn_1111"><FONT SIZE="1">1112</FONT></A>
&#160; Likewise because by the goodness of God sins are forgiven to the converted, the very fact that Christ was sent sufficiently shows, who not in His own nature as God, but in our nature, which He assumed from a woman, died for us; which goodness of God with reference to us, and which love of God, the apostle thus sets forth:&#160; "But God commendeth His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us; much more now being justified in His blood we shall be saved from wrath through Him.&#160; For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to <A NAME="page_358"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 358</FONT></A> <a name="iv.x.xxxiii-Page_358"></A>God through the death of His Son, much more being reconciled we shall be saved in His life."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1112"></A><A HREF="#fn_1112"><FONT SIZE="1">1113</FONT></A>
&#160; But because even when due punishment is rendered to sinners, there is no unrighteousness on God&#146;s part, he thus says:&#160; "What shall we say?&#160; Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1113"></A><A HREF="#fn_1113"><FONT SIZE="1">1114</FONT></A>
&#160; But in one place he has briefly admonished that goodness and severity are alike from Him, saying:&#160; "Thou seest then the goodness and severity of God; toward them that have fallen, severity, but towards thee goodness, if thou shouldst continue in goodness."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1114"></A><A HREF="#fn_1114"><FONT SIZE="1">1115</FONT></A>
