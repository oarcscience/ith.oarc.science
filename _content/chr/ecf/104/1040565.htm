<p class="c41"><a name="v.v.iv.lxxviii-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.lxxviii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 78.&#8212;</span>171.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.lxxviii-p1.2"></A>Petilianus</span> said:&#160; "For what kind of faith is that which is in you which is devoid of charity? when Paul himself says, &#145;Though I speak with the tongues of men, and have the knowledge of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.&#160; And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I   could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.&#160; And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.&#146;"</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.lxxviii-p2"></A>172.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.lxxviii-p2.1"></A>Augustin</span> answered:&#160; This is what I said just now, that you were desirous to be clad in sheep&#146;s clothing, that, if possible, the sheep might feel your bite before it had any consciousness of your approach.&#160; Is it not that praise of charity in which you indulge that commonly proves your calumny in the clearest light of truth?&#160; Will you bring it about that those arms shall be no longer ours, because you endeavor to appropriate them   first?&#160; Furthermore, these arms are endowed with life:&#160; from whatever quarter they are launched, they recognize whom they should destroy.&#160; If they have been sent forth from our hands, they will fix themselves in you; if they are aimed by you, they recoil upon yourselves.&#160; For in these apostolic words, which commend the excellence of charity, we are wont to show to you how profitless it is to man that he should <A NAME="page_570"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 570</FONT></A> <a name="v.v.iv.lxxviii-Page_570"></A>be in possession of faith or of the sacraments, when he has not   charity, that, when you come to Catholic unity, you may understand what it is that is conferred on you, and how great a thing it is of which you were at least to some extent in want; for Christian charity cannot be preserved except in the unity of the Church:&#160; and that so you may see that without it you are nothing, even though you may be in possession of baptism and faith, and through this latter may be able even to remove mountains.&#160; But if this is your opinion as well, let us not repudiate   and reject in you either the sacraments of God which we know, or faith itself, but let us hold fast charity, without which we are nothing even with the sacraments and with faith.&#160; But we hold fast charity if we cling to unity; while we cling to unity, if we do not make a fictitious unity in a party by our own words, but recognize it in a united whole through the words of Christ.</p>
