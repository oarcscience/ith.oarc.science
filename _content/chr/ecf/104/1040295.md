<span id="v.iv.v.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.v.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—</span>22.  "For as regards the
fact that to preserve the figure of unity the Lord gave the power to
Peter that whatsoever he should loose on earth should be loosed," <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305) it is clear that that unity is also
described as one dove without fault. <span
id="fr_1306"></span>[1307](#fn_1306)   Can it be said, then, that to
this same dove belong all those greedy ones, whose existence in the same
Catholic Church Cyprian himself so grievously bewailed?  For birds of
prey, I believe, cannot be called doves, but rather hawks.  How then did
they baptize those who used to plunder estates by treacherous deceit,
and increase their profits by compound usury, <span
id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307) if baptism is only given by that
indivisible and chaste and perfect dove, that unity which can only be
understood as existing among the good?  Is it possible that, by the
prayers of the saints who are spiritual within the Church, as though by
the frequent lamentations of the dove, a great sacrament is dispensed,
with a secret administration of the mercy of God, so that their sins
also are loosed who are baptized, not by the dove but by the hawk, if
they come to that sacrament in the peace of Catholic unity?  But if this
be so, why should it not also be the case that, as each man comes from
heresy or schism to the Catholic peace, his sins should be loosed
through their prayers?  But the integrity of the sacrament is everywhere
recognized, though it will not avail for the irrevocable remission of
sins outside the unity of the Church.  Nor will the prayers of the
saints, or, in other words, the groanings of that one dove, be able to
help one who is set in heresy or schism; just as they are not able to
help one who is placed within the Church, if by a wicked life he himself
retain the debts of his sins against himself, and that though he be
baptized, not by this hawk, but by the pious ministry of the dove
herself.
