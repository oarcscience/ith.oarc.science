<p class="c10"><a name="iv.viii.xxx-p2"></A>32.&#160; Whose arrangement, then, is this?&#160; Who made the distinctions and the classification?&#160; Who gave the number, the qualities, the forms, the life?&#160; For all these things are in themselves good, nor could each of the natures have them except from the bestowal of God, the author of all good things.&#160; For this is not like the descriptions or suppositions of poets about an imaginary chaos, as being a shapeless mass, without form, without quality, without measurement, without weight and number, without order and variety; a confused something, absolutely destitute of qualities, so that some Greek writers call it <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.viii.xxx-p2.1"></A>&#7940;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>.&#160; So far from being like this is the Manich&aelig;an description of the region of darkness, as they call it, that, in a directly contrary style, they add side to side, and join border to border; they number five natures; they separate, arrange, and assign to each its own qualities.&#160; Nor do they leave the natures barren or waste, but people them with their proper inhabitants; and to these, again, they give suitable forms, and adapted to their place of habitation, besides giving the chief of all endowments, life.&#160; To recount such good things as these, and to speak of them as having no connection with God, the author of all good things, is to lose sight of the excellence of the order in the things, and of the great evil of the error which leads to such a conclusion.</p>
