<span id="v.v.iii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—</span>14.  If, in the
interests of the unity of the party of Donatus, no one rebaptizes those
who were baptized in a wicked schism, and men, who are guilty of a crime
of such enormity as to be compared by them in their Council to those
ancient authors of schism whom the earth swallowed up alive, <span
id="fr_1943"></span>[1944](#fn_1943) are either unpunished after
separation, or restored again to their position after condemnation; why
is it that, in defence of the unity of Christ, which is spread
throughout the whole inhabited world, of which it has been predicted
that it shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river unto the
ends of the earth, <span id="fr_1944"></span>[1945](#fn_1944) —a
prediction which seems from actual proof to be in process of
fulfillment; why is it that, in defence of this unity, they do not
acknowledge the true and universal law of that inheritance which rings
forth from the books that are common to us all:  "I shall give Thee the
heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
Thy possession?" <span id="fr_1945"></span>[1946](#fn_1945)   In behalf
of the unity of Donatus, they are not compelled to call together again
what they have scattered abroad, but are warned to hear the cry of the
Scriptures:  why will they not understand that they meet with such
treatment through the mercy of God, that since they brought false
charges against the Catholic Church, by contact as it were with which
they were unwilling to defile their own excessive sanctity, they should
be compelled by the sovereign authority of Optatus Gildonianus to
receive again and associate with themselves true offenses of the
greatest enormity, condemned by the true voice, as they say, of their
own plenary Council?  Let them at length perceive how they are filled
with the true crimes of their own party, after inventing fictitious
crimes wherewith to charge their brethren, when, even if the charges had
been true, they ought at length to feel how much should be endured in
the cause of peace, and in behalf of Christ’s peace to return to a
Church which did not condemn crimes undiscovered, if on behalf of the
peace of Donatus they were ready to pardon such as were condemned.
