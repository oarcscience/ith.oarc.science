<span id="iv.vi.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.vi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—Even the Soul of a Fly is More
Excellent Than the Light.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.v-p2"></span>4.  And here, if perchance in their
confusion they had inquired of me whether I thought that the soul even
of a fly <span id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197) surpasses that light, I
should have replied, yes, nor should it have troubled me that the fly is
little, but it should have confirmed me that it is alive.  For it is
inquired, what causes those members so diminutive to grow, what leads so
minute a body here and there according to its natural appetite, what
moves its feet in numerical order when it is running, what regulates and
gives vibration to its wings when flying?  This thing whatever it is in
so small a creature towers up so prominently to one well considering,
that it excels any lightning flashing upon the eyes.
