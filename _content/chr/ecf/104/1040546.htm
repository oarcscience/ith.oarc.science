 may bring a charge against that nation, of coveting their neighbors&#146; goods, because the Church of Christ is in possession where the persecutors of Christ were wont to reign.&#160; And, after all, when it has been said to yourselves, You are coveting the goods of other men, because you have driven out from the basilicas the followers of Maximianus, you are at a loss to find any answer that you can make.</p>
