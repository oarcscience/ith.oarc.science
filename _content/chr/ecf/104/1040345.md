<span id="v.iv.vii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—</span>How does a murderer
cleanse and sanctify the water? <span
id="fr_1524"></span>[1525](#fn_1524)   How can darkness bless the oil? 
But if God is present in His sacraments to confirm His words by
whomsoever the sacraments may be administered, then both the sacraments
of God are everywhere valid, and evil men whom they profit not are
everywhere perverse.

<span id="v.iv.vii.xx-p3"></span>28.  But what kind of argument is this,
that "a heretic must be considered not to have baptism, because he has
not the Church?"  And it must be acknowledged that "when he is baptized,
he is questioned about the Church." <span
id="fr_1525"></span>[1526](#fn_1525)   Just as though the same question
about the Church were not put in baptism to him who within the Church
renounces the world in word and not in deed.  As therefore his false
answer does not prevent what he receives from being baptism, so also the
false reply of the other about the holy Church does not prevent what he
receives from being baptism; and as the former, if he afterwards fulfill
with truth what he promised in falsehood, does not receive a second
baptism, but only an amended life, so also in the case of the latter, if
he come afterwards to the Church about which he gave a false answer to
the question put to him, thinking that he had it when he had it not, the
Church herself which he did not possess is given him, but what he had
received is not repeated.  But I cannot tell why it should be, that
while God can "sanctify the oil" in answer to the words which proceed
out of the mouth of a murderer, "He yet cannot sanctify it on the altar
reared by a heretic," unless it be that He who is not hindered by the
false conversion of the heart of man within the Church is hindered by
the false erection of some wood without from deigning to be present in
His sacraments, though no falseness on the part of men can hinder Him. 
If, therefore, what is said in the gospel, that "God heareth not
sinners," <span id="fr_1526"></span>[1527](#fn_1526) extends so far that
the sacraments cannot be celebrated by a sinner, how then does He hear a
murderer praying, either over the water of baptism, or over the oil, or
over the eucharist, or over the heads of those on whom his hand is
laid?  All which things are nevertheless done, and are valid, even at
the hands of murderers, that is, at the hands of those who hate their
brethren, even within, in the Church itself.  Since "no one can give
what he does not possess himself,"  <span
id="fr_1527"></span>[1528](#fn_1527) how does a murderer give the Holy
Spirit?  And yet such an one even baptizeth within the Church.  It is
God, therefore, that gives the Holy Spirit even when a man of this kind
is baptizing.
