<span id="v.iv.v.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.v.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—</span>7.  But if any one should
ask what I hold in the meantime, while discussing this question, I
answer that, in the first place, the letter of Cyprian suggested to me
what I should hold till I should see clearly the nature of the question
which next begins to be discussed.  For Cyprian himself says:  "But some
will say, ‘What then will become of those who in times past, coming to
the Church from heresy, were admitted without baptism?’" <span
id="fr_1270"></span>[1271](#fn_1270)   Whether they were really without
baptism, or whether they were admitted because those who admitted them
conceived that they had partaken of baptism, is a matter for our future
consideration.  At any rate, Cyprian himself shows plainly enough what
was the ordinary custom of the Church, when he says that in past time
those who came to the Church from heresy were admitted without baptism.

<span id="v.iv.v.v-p3"></span>8.  For in the Council itself Castus of
Sicca says:  "He who, despising truth, presumes to follow custom, is
either envious or evil-disposed towards the brethren to whom the truth
is revealed, or is ungrateful towards God, by whose inspiration His
Church is instructed." <span id="fr_1271"></span>[1272](#fn_1271)  
Whether the truth had been revealed, we shall investigate hereafter; at
any rate, he acknowledges that the custom of the Church was different.
