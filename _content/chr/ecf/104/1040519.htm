<p class="c41"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxii-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 32.&#8212;</span>72.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxii-p1.2"></A>Petilianus</span> said:&#160; "For although there is only one baptism, yet it is consecrated in three several grades.&#160; John <A NAME="page_548"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 548</FONT></A> <a name="v.v.iv.xxxii-Page_548"></A>gave water without the name of the Trinity, as he declared himself, saying, &#145;I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance:&#160; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and   with fire.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2069"></A><A HREF="#fn_2069"><FONT SIZE="1">2070</FONT></A>
&#160; Christ gave the Holy Spirit, as it is written, &#145;He breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost,&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2070"></A><A HREF="#fn_2070"><FONT SIZE="1">2071</FONT></A>
&#160; And the Comforter Himself came on the apostles as a fire burning with rustling flames.&#160; O true divinity, which seemed to blaze, not to burn! as it is written, &#145;And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where the apostles were sitting.&#160; And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.&#160; And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as   the Spirit gave them utterance.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2071"></A><A HREF="#fn_2071"><FONT SIZE="1">2072</FONT></A>
&#160; But you, O persecutor, have not even the water of repentance, seeing that you hold the power not of the murdered John, but of the murderer Herod.&#160; You therefore, O <i>traditor</i>, have not the Holy Spirit of Christ; for Christ did not betray others to death, but was Himself betrayed.&#160; For you, therefore, the fire in the spirit in Hades is full of life,&#8212;that fire which, surging with hungry tongues of flame, will be able to burn your limbs to all eternity without consuming   them, as it is written of the punishment of the guilty in hell, &#145;Neither shall their fire be quenched.&#146;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2072"></A><A HREF="#fn_2072"><FONT SIZE="1">2073</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxii-p6"></A>73.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxii-p6.1"></A>Augustin</span> answered:&#160; You are the calumnious slanderer, not the truthful arguer.&#160; Will you not at length cease to make assertions of a kind which, if you do not prove them, can apply to nobody; and even if you prove them, certainly cannot apply to the unity of the whole world, which is in the saints as in the wheat of God?&#160; If we too were pleased to return calumnies for calumnies, we too might possibly be able to give vent to eloquent   slanderers.&#160; We too might use the expression, "With rustling flames;" but to me an expression never sounds in any way eloquent which is inappropriate in its use.&#160; We too might say, "Surging with hungry tongues of flame;" but we do not wish that the tongues of flame in our writings, when they are read by any one in his senses, should be judged hungry for want of the sap of weightiness, or that the reader himself, while he finds in them no food of useful sentiments, should be left to suffer from   the hunger of excessive emptiness.&#160; See, I declare that your Circumcelliones are burning, not with rustling but with headlong flames.&#160; If you answer, What is that to us? why do not you, when you reproach with any one whom you will, not listen in turn to our answer, We too know nothing of it?&#160; If you answer, You do not prove the fact, why may not the whole world answer you in turn, Neither do you prove it?&#160; Let us agree, therefore, if you please, that you should not charge us with the guilt of   the wicked men whom you consider to belong to us, and that we should abstain from similar charges against you.&#160; So you will see, by this just agreement, confirmed and ratified, that you have no charge which you can bring against the seed of Abraham, as found in all the nations of the earth.&#160; But I find without difficulty a grievous charge to bring against you:&#160; Why have you impiously separated yourselves from the seed of Abraham, which is in all nations of the earth?&#160; Against this charge you   certainly have no means whereby you may defend yourselves.&#160; For we each of us clear ourselves of the sins of other men; but this, that you do not hold communion with all the nations of the earth, which are blessed in the seed of Abraham, is a very grievous crime, of which not some but all of you are guilty.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxii-p7"></A>74.&#160; And yet you know, as you prove by your quotation, that the Holy Spirit descended in such wise, that those who were then filled with it spake with divers tongues:&#160; what was the meaning of that sign and prodigy?&#160; Why then is the Holy Spirit given now in such wise, that no one to whom it is given speaks with divers tongues, except because that miracle then prefigured that all nations of the earth should believe, and that thus the gospel should be found to be   in every tongue?&#160; Just as it was foretold in the psalm so long before:&#160; "There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard."&#160; This was said with reference to those men who were destined, after receiving the Holy Spirit, to speak with every kind of tongue.&#160; But because this passage itself signified that the gospel should be found hereafter in all nations and languages, and that the body of Christ should sound forth throughout all the world in every tongue, therefore he goes on to   say, "Their sound is gone out throughout all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world."&#160; Hence it is that the true Church is hidden from no one.&#160; And hence comes that which the Lord Himself says in the gospel, "A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2073"></A><A HREF="#fn_2073"><FONT SIZE="1">2074</FONT></A>
&#160; And therefore David continues in the same psalm, "In the sun hath He placed His tabernacle," that is, <A NAME="page_549"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 549</FONT></A> <a name="v.v.iv.xxxii-Page_549"></A>in the open light of day; as we read in the Book of Kings, "For thou didst it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2074"></A><A HREF="#fn_2074"><FONT SIZE="1">2075</FONT></A>
&#160; And He Himself is "as a bridegroom coming out of His chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run His race.&#160; His going forth is from the end of heaven:"&#160; here you have the coming of the Lord in the flesh.&#160; "And His circuit unto the ends of it:"&#160; here you have His resurrection and ascension.&#160; "And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof:"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2075"></A><A HREF="#fn_2075"><FONT SIZE="1">2076</FONT></A>
&#160; here you have the coming of the Holy Spirit, whom He sent in tongues of fire, that He might make manifest the glowing heat of charity, which he certainly cannot have who does not keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace with the Church, which is throughout all languages.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxii-p11"></A>75.&#160; Next, however, with regard to your statement that there is indeed one baptism,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2076"></A><A HREF="#fn_2076"><FONT SIZE="1">2077</FONT></A>
 but that it is consecrated in three several grades, and to your having distributed the three forms of it to three persons after such fashion, that you ascribe the water to John, the Holy Spirit to the Lord Jesus Christ, and, in the third place, the fire to the Comforter sent down from above,&#8212;consider for a moment in how great an error you are involved.&#160; For you were brought to entertain such an opinion simply from the words of John:&#160; "I indeed baptize you with water:&#160; but   He that cometh after me is mightier than I:&#160; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2077"></A><A HREF="#fn_2077"><FONT SIZE="1">2078</FONT></A>
&#160; Nor were you willing to take into consideration that the three things are not attributed to three persons taken one by one,&#8212;water to John, the Holy Spirit to Christ, fire to the Comforter,&#8212;but that the three should rather be referred to two persons&#8212;one of them to John, the other two to our Lord.&#160; For neither is it said, I indeed baptize you with water:&#160; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear:&#160; He shall baptize you with the Holy   Ghost:&#160; and the Comforter, who is to come after Him, He shall baptize you with fire; but "I indeed," He says, "with water:&#160; but He that cometh after me with the Holy Ghost, and with fire."&#160; One he attributes to himself, two to Him that cometh after him.&#160; You see, therefore, how you have been deceived in the number.&#160; Listen further.&#160; You said that there was one baptism consecrated in three stages&#8212;water, the Holy Spirit, and fire; and you assigned three persons to the three stages severally&#8212;John   to the water, Christ to the Spirit, the Comforter to the fire.&#160; If, therefore, the water of John bears reference to the same baptism which is commended as being one, it was not right that those should have been baptized a second time by the command of the Apostle Paul whom he found to have been baptized by John.&#160; For they already had water, belonging, as you say, to the same baptism; so that it remained that they should receive the Holy Spirit and fire, because these were wanting in the baptism   of John, that their baptism might be completed, being consecrated, as you assert, in three stages.&#160; But since they were ordered to be baptized by the authority of an apostle, it is sufficiently made manifest that that water with which John baptized had no reference to the baptism of Christ, but belonged to another dispensation suited to the exigencies of the times.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxii-p14"></A>76.&#160; Lastly, when you wished to prove that the Holy Spirit was given by Christ, and had brought forward as a proof from the gospel, that Jesus on rising from the dead breathed into the face of His disciples, saying, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2078"></A><A HREF="#fn_2078"><FONT SIZE="1">2079</FONT></A>
 and when you wished to prove that that last fire which was named in connection with baptism was found in the tongues of fire which were displayed on the coming of the Holy Ghost, how came it into your head to say, "And the Comforter Himself came upon the apostles as a fire burning with rustling flames," as though there were one Holy Spirit whom He gave by breathing on the face of His disciples, and another who, after His ascension, came on the apostles?&#160; Are we to suppose,   therefore, that there are two Holy Spirits?&#160; Who will be found so utterly mad as to assert this?&#160; Christ therefore Himself gave the same Holy Spirit, whether by breathing on the face of the disciples, or by sending Him down from heaven on the day of Pentecost, with undoubted commendation of His holy sacrament.&#160; Accordingly it was not that Christ gave the Holy Spirit, and the Comforter gave the fire, that the saying might be fulfilled, "With the Holy Spirit, and with fire;" but the same Christ   Himself gave the Holy Spirit in both cases, making it manifest while He was yet on earth by His breathing, and when He was ascended into heaven by the tongues of flame.&#160; For that you may know that the words of John, "He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost," were not fulfilled at the time when He breathed on His disciples face, so that they should require to be baptized, when the Comforter should come, not with the Spirit any longer, but with fire, I would have you remember the most outspoken   words of Scripture, and see what the Lord Himself said to <A NAME="page_550"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 550</FONT></A> <a name="v.v.iv.xxxii-Page_550"></A>them when He ascended into heaven:&#160; "John truly baptized you with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, whom ye shall receive not many days hence at Pentecost."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2079"></A><A HREF="#fn_2079"><FONT SIZE="1">2080</FONT></A>
&#160; What could be plainer than this testimony?&#160; But according to your interpretation, what He should have said was this:&#160; John verily baptized you with water; but ye were baptized with the Holy Spirit when I breathed on your faces; and next in due order shall ye be baptized with fire, which ye shall receive not many days hence;&#8212;in order that by this means the three stages should be completed, in which you say that the one baptism was consecrated.&#160; And so it proves to be the   case that you are still ignorant of the meaning of the words, "He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire;" and you are rash enough to be williing to teach what you do not know yourselves.</p>
