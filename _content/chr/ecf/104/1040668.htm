<p class="c41"><a name="v.vi.xi-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.vi.xi-p1.1"></A>Chapter 9.&#8212;</span>35.&#160; As to the charge that they bring against us, that we covet and plunder their possessions, I would that they would become Catholics, and possess in peace and love with us, not only what they call theirs, but also what confessedly belongs to us.&#160; But they are so blinded with the desire of uttering calumnies, that they do not observe how inconsistent their statements are with one another.&#160; At any rate, they assert, and seem to make it a subject of most invidious complaint among themselves, that we constrain them to come in to our communion by the violent authority of the laws,&#8212;which we certainly should not do by any means, if we wished to gain possession of their property.&#160; What avaricious man ever wished for another to share his possessions?&#160; Who that was inflamed with the desire of empire, or elated by the pride of its possession, ever wished to have a partner?&#160; Let them at any rate look on those very men who once belonged to them, but now are our brethren joined to us by the bond of fraternal affection, and see how they hold not only what they used to have, but also what was ours, which they did not have before; which yet, if we are living as poor in fellowship with poor, belongs to us and them alike; whilst, if we possess of our private means enough for our wants, it is no longer ours, inasmuch as we do not commit so infamous an act of usurpation as to claim for our own the property of the poor, for whom we are in some sense the trustees.</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.xi-p2"></A>36.&#160; Everything, therefore, that was held in the name of the churches of the party of Donatus, was ordered by the Christian emperors, in their pious laws, to pass to the Catholic Church, with the possession of the buildings themselves.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2528"></A><A HREF="#fn_2528"><FONT SIZE="1">2529</FONT></A>
&#160; Seeing, then, that there are with us poor members of those said churches who used to be maintained by these same paltry possessions, let them rather cease themselves to covet what belongs to others whilst they remain outside, and so let them enter within the bond of unity, that we may all alike administer, not only the property which they call their own, but also with it what is asserted to be ours.&#160; For it is written "All are yours; and ye are Christ&#146;s; and Christ is God&#146;s."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2529"></A><A HREF="#fn_2529"><FONT SIZE="1">2530</FONT></A>
&#160; Under Him as our Head, let us all be one in His one body; and in all such matters as you speak of, let us follow the example which is recorded in the Acts of the Apostles:&#160; "They were of one heart and of one soul:&#160; neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2530"></A><A HREF="#fn_2530"><FONT SIZE="1">2531</FONT></A>
&#160; Let us love what we sing:&#160; "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2531"></A><A HREF="#fn_2531"><FONT SIZE="1">2532</FONT></A>
 that so they may know, by their own experience, with what perfect truth their mother, the Catholic Church, calls out to them what the blessed apostle writes to the Corinthians:&#160; "I seek not yours, but you."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2532"></A><A HREF="#fn_2532"><FONT SIZE="1">2533</FONT></A>
</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.xi-p8"></A>37.&#160; But if we consider what is said in the Book of Wisdom, "Therefore the righteous spoiled the ungodly;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2533"></A><A HREF="#fn_2533"><FONT SIZE="1">2534</FONT></A>
 and also what is said in the Proverbs, "The wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2534"></A><A HREF="#fn_2534"><FONT SIZE="1">2535</FONT></A>
 then we shall see that the question is not, who are in possession of the property of the heretics? but who are in the society of the just?&#160; We know, indeed, that the Donatists arrogate to themselves such a store of justice, that they boast not only that they possess it, but that they also bestow it upon other men.&#160; For they say that any one whom they have baptized is justified by them, after which there is nothing left for them but to say to the person who is baptized by them that he must needs believe on him who has administered the sacrament; for why should he not do so, when the apostle says, "To him that believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2535"></A><A HREF="#fn_2535"><FONT SIZE="1">2536</FONT></A>
&#160; Let him believe, therefore, upon the man by whom he is baptized, if it be none else that justifies him, that his faith may be counted for righteousness.&#160; But I think that even they themselves would look with horror on themselves, if they ventured for a moment to entertain such thoughts as these.&#160; For there is none that is just and able to justify, save God alone.&#160; But the same might be said of <A NAME="page_647"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 647</FONT></A> <a name="v.vi.xi-Page_647"></A>them that the apostle says of the Jews, that "being ignorant of God&#146;s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2536"></A><A HREF="#fn_2536"><FONT SIZE="1">2537</FONT></A>
</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.xi-p13"></A>38.&#160; But far be it from us that any one of our number should call himself in such wise just, that he should either go about to establish his own righteousness, as though it were conferred upon him by himself, whereas it is said to him, "For what hast thou that thou didst not receive?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2537"></A><A HREF="#fn_2537"><FONT SIZE="1">2538</FONT></A>
 or venture to boast himself as being without sin in this world, as the Donatists themselves declared in our conference that they were members of a Church which has already neither spot nor wrinkle, nor any such thing,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2538"></A><A HREF="#fn_2538"><FONT SIZE="1">2539</FONT></A>
&#8212;not knowing that this is only fulfilled in those individuals who depart out of this body immediately after baptism, or after the forgiveness of sins, for which we make petition in our prayers; but that for the Church, as a whole, the time will not come when it shall be altogether without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, till the day when we shall hear the words, "O death, where is thy sting?&#160; O grave, where is thy victory?&#160; The sting of death is sin." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2539"></A><A HREF="#fn_2539"><FONT SIZE="1">2540</FONT></A>
</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.xi-p17"></A>39.&#160; But in this life, when the corruptible body presseth down the soul,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2540"></A><A HREF="#fn_2540"><FONT SIZE="1">2541</FONT></A>
 if their Church is already of such a character as they maintain, they would not utter unto God the prayer which our Lord has taught us to employ:&#160; "Forgive us our debts."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2541"></A><A HREF="#fn_2541"><FONT SIZE="1">2542</FONT></A>
&#160; For since all sins have been remitted in baptism, why does the Church make this petition, if already, even in this life, it has neither spot nor wrinkle, nor any such thing?&#160; They would also have a fight to despise the warning of the Apostle John, when he cries out in his epistle, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.&#160; But if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2542"></A><A HREF="#fn_2542"><FONT SIZE="1">2543</FONT></A>
&#160; On account of this hope, the universal Church utters the petition, "Forgive us our debts," that when He sees that we are not vainglorious, but ready to confess our sins, He may cleanse us from all unrighteousness, and that so the Lord Jesus Christ may show to Himself in that day a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, which now He cleanses with the washing of water in the word:&#160; because, on the one hand, there is nothing that remains behind in baptism to hinder the forgiveness of every bygone sin (so long, that is, as baptism is not received to no effect without the Church, but is either administered within the Church, or, at least, if it has been already administered without, the recipient does not remain outside with it); and, on the other hand, whatever pollution of sin, of whatsoever kind, is contracted through the weakness of human nature by those who live here after baptism, is cleansed away in virtue of the same laver&#146;s efficacy.&#160; For neither is it of any avail for one who has not been baptized to say, "Forgive us our debts."</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.xi-p21"></A>40.&#160; Accordingly, He so now cleanses His Church by the washing of water in the word, that He may hereafter show it to Himself as not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,&#8212;altogether beautiful, that is to say, and in absolute perfection, when death shall be "swallowed up in victory."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2543"></A><A HREF="#fn_2543"><FONT SIZE="1">2544</FONT></A>
&#160; Now, therefore, in so far as the life is flourishing within us that proceeds from our being born of God, living by faith, so far we are righteous; but in so far as we drag along with us the traces of our mortal nature as derived from Adam, so far we cannot be free from sin.&#160; For there is truth both in the statement that "whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2544"></A><A HREF="#fn_2544"><FONT SIZE="1">2545</FONT></A>
 and also in the former statement, that "if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2545"></A><A HREF="#fn_2545"><FONT SIZE="1">2546</FONT></A>
&#160; The Lord Jesus, therefore, is both righteous and able to justify; but we are justified freely by no other grace than His.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2546"></A><A HREF="#fn_2546"><FONT SIZE="1">2547</FONT></A>
&#160; For there is nothing that justifieth save His body, which is the Church; and therefore, if the body of Christ bears off the spoils of the unrighteous, and the riches of the unrighteous are laid up in store as treasures for the body of Christ, the unrighteous ought not therefore to remain outside, but rather to enter within, that so they may be justified.</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.xi-p26"></A>41.&#160; Whence also we may be sure that what is written concerning the day of judgment, "Then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him, and made no account of his labors,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2547"></A><A HREF="#fn_2547"><FONT SIZE="1">2548</FONT></A>
 is not to be taken in such a sense as that the Canaanite shall stand before the face of Israel, though Israel made no account of the labors of the Canaanite; but only as that Naboth shall stand before the face of Ahab, since Ahab made no account of the labors of Naboth, since the Canaanite was unrighteous, while Naboth was a righteous man.&#160; In the same way the heathen shall not stand before the face of the Christian, who made no account of his labors, when the temples of the idols were plundered and destroyed; but the Christian shall stand before <A NAME="page_648"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 648</FONT></A> <a name="v.vi.xi-Page_648"></A>the face of the heathen, who made no account of his labors, when the bodies of the martyrs were laid low in death.&#160; In the same way, therefore, the heretic shall not stand in the face of the Catholic, who made no account of his labors, when the laws of the Catholic emperors were put in force; but the Catholic shall stand in the face of the heretic, who made no account of his labors when the madness of the ungodly Circumcelliones was allowed to have its way.&#160; For the passage of Scripture decides the question in itself, seeing that it does not say, Then shall men stand, but "Then shall the righteous stand;" and they shall stand "in great boldness" because they stand in the power of a good conscience.</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.xi-p28"></A>42.&#160; But in this world no one is righteous by his own righteousness,&#8212;that is, as though it were wrought by himself and for himself; but as the apostle says, "According as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith."&#160; But then he goes on to add the following:&#160; "For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office; so we, being many, are one body in Christ."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2548"></A><A HREF="#fn_2548"><FONT SIZE="1">2549</FONT></A>
&#160; And according to this doctrine, no one can be righteous so long as he is separated from the unity of this body.&#160; For in the same manner as if a limb be cut off from the body of a living man, it cannot any longer retain the spirit of life; so the man who is cut off from the body of Christ, who is righteous, can in no wise retain the spirit of righteousness, even if he retain the form of membership which he received when in the body.&#160; Let them therefore come into the framework of this body, and so possess their own labors, not through the lust of lordship, but through the godliness of using them aright.&#160; But we, as has been said before, cleanse our wills from the pollution of this concupiscence, even in the judgment of any enemy you please to name as judge, seeing that we use our utmost efforts in entreating the very men of whose labors we avail ourselves to enjoy with us, within the society of the Catholic Church, the fruits both of their labors and of our own.</p>
