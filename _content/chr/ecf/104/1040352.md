<span id="v.iv.vii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—</span>38.  And in that the
Church is thus described in the Song of Songs, "A garden enclosed is my
sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed, a well of living
water; thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant
fruits;" <span id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568) I dare not
understand this save of the holy and just,—not of the covetous, and
defrauders, and robbers, and usurers, and drunkards, and the envious, of
whom we yet both learn most fully from Cyprian’s letters, as I have
often shown, and teach ourselves, that they had baptism in common with
the just, in common with whom they certainly had not Christian charity. 
For I would that some one would tell me how they "crept into the garden
enclosed and the <span id="page_477">p. 477</span> <span
id="v.iv.vii.xxvii-Page_477"></span>fountain sealed," of whom Cyprian
bears witness that they renounced the world in word and not in deed, and
that yet they were within the Church.  For if they both are themselves
there, and are themselves the bride of Christ, can she then be as she is
described "without spot or wrinkle," <span
id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569) and is the fair dove defiled with
such a portion of her members?  Are these the thorns among which she is
a lily, as it is said in the same Song? <span
id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570)   So far therefore, as the lily
extends, so far does "the garden enclosed and the fountain sealed,"
namely, through all those just persons who are Jews inwardly in the
circumcision of the heart <span id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571)
(for "the king’s daughter is all glorious within" <span
id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572) ), in whom is the fixed number of
the saints predestined before the foundation of the world.  But that
multitude of thorns, whether in secret or in open separation, is
pressing on it from without, above number.  "If I would declare them,"
it is said, "and speak of them, they are more than can be
numbered." <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573)   The number,
therefore, of the just persons, "who are the called according to His
purpose," <span id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574) of whom it is said,
"The Lord knoweth them that are His," <span
id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575) is itself "the garden enclosed, the
fountain sealed, a well of living water, the orchard of pomegranates
with pleasant fruits."  Of this number some live according to the
Spirit, and enter on the excellent way of charity; and when they
"restore a man that is overtaken in a fault in the spirit of meekness,
they consider themselves, lest they also be tempted." <span
id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576)   And when it happens that they
also are themselves overtaken, the affection of charity is but a little
checked, and not extinguished; and again rising up and being kindled
afresh, it is restored to its former course.  For they know how to say,
"My soul melteth for heaviness:  strengthen thou me according unto Thy
word." <span id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577)   But when "in
anything they be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto
them," <span id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578) if they abide in the
burning flame of charity, and do not break the bond of peace.  But some
who are yet carnal, and full of fleshly appetites, are instant in
working out their progress; and that they may become fit for heavenly
food, they are nourished with the milk of the holy mysteries, they avoid
in the fear of God whatever is manifestly corrupt even in the opinion of
the world, and they strive most watchfully that they may be less and
less delighted with worldly and temporal matters.  They observe most
constantly the rule of faith which has been sought out with diligence;
and if in aught they stray from it, they submit to speedy correction
under Catholic authority, although, in Cyprian’s words, they be tossed
about, by reason of their fleshly appetite, with the various conflicts
of phantasies.  There are some also who as yet live wickedly, or even
lie in heresies or the superstitions of the Gentiles, and yet even then
"the Lord knoweth them that are His."  For, in that unspeakable
foreknowledge of God, many who seem to be without are in reality within,
and many who seem to be within yet really are without.  Of all those,
therefore, who, if I may so say, are inwardly and secretly within, is
that "enclosed garden" composed, "the fountain sealed, a well of living
water, the orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits."  The divinely
imparted gifts of these are partly peculiar to themselves, as in this
world the charity that never faileth, and in the world to come eternal
life; partly they are common with evil and perverse men, as all the
other things in which consist the holy mysteries.
