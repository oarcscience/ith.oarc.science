<span id="v.iv.vii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—</span>13.  For we must look at
the point which especially concerns the matter before us (whatever be
the nature of the baptism of John, since it is clear that he belongs to
the unity of Christ), viz., what is the reason for which it was right
that men should be baptized again after receiving the baptism of the
holy John, and why they ought not to be baptized again after receiving
the baptism of the covetous bishops.  For no one denies that in the
Lord’s field John was as wheat, bearing an hundred-fold, if that be the
highest rate of increase; also no one doubts that covetousness, which is
idolatry, is reckoned in the Lord’s harvest among the chaff.  Why then
is a man baptized again after receiving baptism from the wheat, and not
after receiving it from the chaff?  If it was because he was better than
John that Paul baptized after John, why did not also Cyprian baptize
after his usurious colleagues, than whom he was better beyond all
comparison?  If it was because they were in unity with him that he did
not baptize after such colleagues, neither ought Paul to have baptized
after John, because they were joined together in the same unity.  Can it
be that defrauders and extortioners belong to the members of that one
dove, and that he does not belong to it to whom the full power of the
Lord Jesus Christ was shown by the appearance of the Holy Spirit in the
form of a dove? <span id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493)   Truly he
belongs most closely to it; but the others, who must be separated from
it either by the occasion of some scandal, or by the winnowing at the
last day, do not by any means belong to it, and yet baptism was repeated
after John and not after them.  What then is the cause, except that the
baptism which Paul ordered them to receive was not the same as that
which was given at the hands of John?  And so in the same unity of the
Church, the baptism of Christ cannot be repeated though it be given by
an usurious minister; but those who receive the baptism of John, even
from the hands of John Himself, ought to be afterwards baptized with the
baptism of Christ.
