<p class="c41"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxvi-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxvi-p1.1"></A>Chapter 36.&#8212;</span>83.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxvi-p1.2"></A>Petilianus</span> said:&#160; "Which <A NAME="page_552"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 552</FONT></A> <a name="v.v.iv.xxxvi-Page_552"></A>Holy Spirit certainly cannot come on you, who have not been washed even with the baptism of repentance; but the water of the <i>traditor</i>, which most truly needs to be repented of, does but work pollution."</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxvi-p2"></A>84.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xxxvi-p2.1"></A>Augustin</span> answered:&#160; As a matter of fact, not only do you not prove us to be <i>traditors</i>, but neither did your fathers prove that our fathers were guilty of that sin; though, even if that had been proved, the consequence would have been that they would not be our fathers, according to your earlier assertion, seeing that we had not followed their deeds:&#160; yet neither should we on their account be severed from the companionship of   unity, and from the seed of Abraham, in which all nations of the earth are blessed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2085"></A><A HREF="#fn_2085"><FONT SIZE="1">2086</FONT></A>
&#160; However, if the water of Christ be one thing, and the water of the <i> traditor</i> another, because Christ was not a <i>traditor</i>, why should not the water of Christ be one thing, and the water of a robber another, since certainly Christ was not a robber?&#160; Do you therefore baptize again after baptism by your robber, and I will baptize again after the <i>traditor</i>, who is neither mine nor yours; or, if one must believe the documents which are produced, who is both   mine and yours; or, if we are to believe the communion of the whole world rather than the party of Donatus, who is not mine, but yours.&#160; But, by a better and a sounder judgment, because it is according to the words of the apostle, every one of us shall bear his own burden;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2086"></A><A HREF="#fn_2086"><FONT SIZE="1">2087</FONT></A>
 nor is either that robber yours, if you are not yourselves robbers; nor does any <i>traditor</i> belong to any one either of us or you, who is not himself a <i> traditor</i>.&#160; And yet we are Catholics, who, following the spirit of that judgment, do not desert the unity of the Church; but you are heretics, who, on account of charges, whether true or false, which you have brought against certain men, are unwilling to maintain Christian charity with the seed of   Abraham.</p>
