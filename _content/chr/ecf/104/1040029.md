<span id="iv.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—God is the Chief Good, Whom We are
to Seek After with Supreme Affection.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.x-p2"></span>13.  Let us see how the Lord Himself in the
gospel has taught us to live; how, too, Paul the apostle,—for the
Manichæans dare not reject these Scriptures.  Let us hear, O Christ,
what chief end Thou dost prescribe to us; and that is evidently the
chief end <span id="page_45">p. 45</span> <span
id="iv.iv.x-Page_45"></span>after which we are told to strive with
supreme affection.  "Thou shalt love," He says, "the Lord thy God." 
Tell me also, I pray Thee, what must be the measure of love; for I fear
lest the desire enkindled in my heart should either exceed or come short
in fervor.  "With all thy heart," He says.  Nor is that enough.  "With
all thy soul."  Nor is it enough yet.  "With all thy mind." <span
id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48)  What do you wish more?  I might,
perhaps, wish more if I could see the possibility of more.  What does
Paul say on this?  "We know," he says, "that all things issue in good to
them that love God."  Let him, too, say what is the measure of love. 
"Who then," he says, "shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall
tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or
peril, or the sword?" <span id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49)   We have
heard, then, what and how much we must love; this we must strive after,
and to this we must refer all our plans.  The perfection of all our good
things and our perfect good is God.  We must neither come short of this
nor go beyond it:  the one is dangerous, the other impossible.
