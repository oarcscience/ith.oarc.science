<span id="v.iv.iii.xv"></span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—</span>23.  For it is the
Church that gives birth to all, either within her pale, of her own womb;
or beyond it, of the seed of her bridegroom,—(either of herself, or of
her handmaid. <span id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186) )  But Esau,
even though born of the lawful wife, was separated from the people of
God because he quarrelled with his brother.  And Asher, born indeed by
the authority of a wife, but yet of a handmaid, was admitted to the land
of promise on account of his brotherly good-will.  Whence also it was
not the being born of a handmaid, but his quarrelling with his brother,
that stood in the way of Ishmael, to cause his separation from the
people of God; and he received no benefit from the power of the wife,
whose son he rather was, inasmuch as it was in virtue of her conjugal
rights that he was both conceived in and born of the womb of the
handmaid.  Just as with the Donatists it is by the right of the Church,
which exists in baptism, that whosoever is born receives his birth; but
if they agree with their brethren, through the unity of peace they come
to the land of promise, not to be again cast out from the bosom of their
true mother, but to be acknowledged in the seed of their father; but if
they persevere in discord, they will belong to the line of Ishmael.  For
Ishmael was first, and then Isaac; and Esau was the elder, Jacob the
younger.  Not that heresy gives birth before the Church, or that the
Church herself gives birth first to those who are carnal or animal, and
afterwards to those who are spiritual; but because, in the actual lot of
our mortality, in which we are born of the seed of Adam, "that was not
first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterward that
which is spiritual." <span id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187)   But
from mere animal sensation, because "the natural man receiveth not the
things of the Spirit of God," <span id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188)
arise all dissensions and schisms.  And the apostle says <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[1190](#fn_1189) that all who persevere in this
animal sensation belong to the old covenant. that is, to the desire of
earthly promises, which are indeed the type of the spiritual; but "the
natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God." <span
id="fr_1190"></span>[1191](#fn_1190)

<span id="v.iv.iii.xv-p7"></span>24.  At whatever time, therefore, men
have begun to be of such a nature in this life, that, although they have
partaken of such divine sacraments as were appointed for the
dispensation under which they lived, they yet savor of carnal things,
and hope for and desire carnal things from God, whether in this life or
afterwards, they are yet carnal.  But the Church, which is the people of
God, is an ancient institution even in the pilgrimage of this life,
having a carnal interest in some men, a spiritual interest in others. 
To the carnal belongs the old covenant, to the spiritual the new.  But
in the first days both were hidden, from Adam even to Moses.  But by
Moses the old covenant was made manifest, and in it was hidden the new
covenant, because after <span id="page_422">p. 422</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii.xv-Page_422"></span>a secret fashion it was typified.  But
so soon as the Lord came in the flesh, the new covenant was revealed;
yet, though the sacraments of the old covenant passed away; the
dispositions peculiar to it did not pass away.  For they still exist in
those whom the apostle declares to be already born indeed by the
sacrament of the new covenant, but yet capable, as being natural, of
receiving the things of the Spirit of God.  For, as in the sacraments of
the old covenant some persons were already spiritual, belonging secretly
to the new covenant, which was then concealed, so now also in the
sacrament of the new covenant, which has been by this time revealed,
many live who are natural.  And if they will not advance to receive the
things of the Spirit of God, to which the discourse of the apostle urges
them, they will still belong to the old covenant.  But if they advance,
even before they receive them, yet by their very advance and approach
they belong to the new covenant; and if, before becoming spiritual, they
are snatched away from this life, yet through the protection of the
holiness of the sacrament they are reckoned in the land of the living,
where the Lord is our hope and our portion.  Nor can I find any truer
interpretation of the scripture, "Thine eyes did see my substance, yet
being imperfect" <span id="fr_1191"></span>[1192](#fn_1191) considering
what follows, "And in Thy book shall all be written." <span
id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192)
