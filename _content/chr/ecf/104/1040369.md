<span id="v.iv.viii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—</span>24.  Crescens of
Cirta <span id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635) said:  "The letters of
our most beloved Cyprian to Jubaianus, and also to Stephen, <span
id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636) having been read in so large an
assembly of our most holy brethren in the priesthood, containing as they
do so large a body of sacred testimony derived from the Scriptures that
give us our God, <span id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637) that we have
every reason to assent to them, being all united by the grace of God, I
give my judgment that all heretics or schismatics who wish to come to
the Catholic Church should not enter therein unless they have been first
exorcised and baptized; with the obvious exception of those who have
been originally baptized in the Catholic Church, these being reconciled
and admitted to the penance of the Church by the imposition of
hands." <span id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xv-p6"></span>25.  Here we are warned once more to
inquire why he says, "Except, of course, those who have been originally
baptized in the Catholic Church."  Is it because they had not lost what
they had before received?  Why then could they not also transmit outside
the Church what they were able to possess outside?  Is it that outside
it is unlawfully transmitted?  But neither is it lawfully possessed
outside, and yet it is possessed; so it is unlawfully given outside, but
yet it is given.  But what is given to the person returning from heresy
who had been baptized inside, is given to the person coming to the
Church who had been baptized outside,—that is, that he may have lawfully
inside what before he had unlawfully outside.  But perhaps some one may
ask what was said on this point in the letter of the blessed Cyprian to
Stephen, which is mentioned in this judgment, though not in the opening
address to the Council,—I suppose because it was not considered
necessary.  For Crescens stated that the letter itself had been read in
the assembly, which I have no doubt was done, if I am not mistaken, as
is customary, in order that the bishops, being already assembled, might
receive some information at the same time on the subject contained in
that letter.  For it certainly has no bearing on the present subject;
and I am more surprised at Crescens having thought fit to mention it at
all, than at its having been passed over in the opening address.  But if
any one thinks that I have shrunk from bringing forward something which
has been urged in it that is essential to the present point, let him
read it and see that what I say is true; or if he finds it otherwise,
let him convict me of falsehood.  For that letter contains nothing
whatsoever about baptism administered among heretics or schismatics,
which is the subject of our present argument. <span

<span id="v.iv.viii.xv-p7"></span> There are two letters extant from
Cyprian to Stephen, No. 68, respecting Marcianus of Arles, who had
joined Novatian, and No. 72, on a Council concerning heretical baptism. 
It is clear, however, from *Ep*. lxxiv. 1, that this Council, and
consequently the letter to Stephen, was subsequent to the Council under
consideration; and consequently Augustin is right in ignoring it, and
referring solely to the former.  Dr. Routh thinks the words an
interpolation, of course before Augustin’s time; and they may perhaps
have been inserted by some one who had Cyprian’s later letter to Stephen
before his mind.  *Rel. Sac*. iii. p. 194.
