 together with Maximianus and the others who ordained him,&#8212;I mean Felicianus of Musti, and Pr&aelig;textatus of Assura, of whom I speak in the meantime, who are counted among the twelve ordainers of Maximianus, as erecting an altar in opposition to their altar at which Primianus stands?&#160; They surely are reckoned by them among the dead.&#160; To this we have the express testimony of the noble decree of that Council of theirs which formerly called forth shouts of unreserved   &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1942"></A><A HREF="#fn_1942"><FONT SIZE="1">1943</FONT></A>
 applause when it was recited among them for the purpose of being decreed, but which would now be received in silence if we should chance to recite it in their ears; whereas they should rather have been slow at first to rejoice in its eloquence, lest they should afterwards come to mourn over it when its credit was destroyed.&#160; For in it they speak in the following terms of the followers of Maximianus, who were shut out from their communion:&#160; "Seeing that the shipwrecked   members of certain men have been dashed by the waves of truth upon the sharp rocks, and after the fashion of the Egyptians, the shores are covered with the bodies of the dying; whose punishment is intensified in death itself, since after their life has been wrung from them by the avenging waters, they fail to find so much as burial."&#160; In such gross terms indeed, do they insult those who were guilty of schism from their body, that they call them dead and unburied; but certainly they ought to   have wished that they might obtain burial, if it were only that they might not have seen Optatus Gildonianus advancing with a military force, and like a sweeping wave that dashes beyond its fellows, sucking back Felicianus and Pr&aelig;textatus once again within their pale, out of the multitude of bodies lying unburied on the shore.</p>
