<span id="v.iv.ix.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40.—</span>78.  Salvianus of
Gazaufala <span id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862) said:  "It is
generally known that heretics have nothing; and therefore they come to
us, that they may receive what previously they did not have." <span

<span id="v.iv.ix.xl-p4"></span>79.  Our answer is:  On this theory, the
very men who founded heresies are not heretics themselves, because they
separated themselves from the Church, and certainly they previously had
what they received there.  But if it is absurd to say that those are not
heretics through whom the rest became heretics, it is therefore possible
that a heretic should have what turns to his destruction through his
evil use of it.
