<span id="v.v.v.liii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 53.—</span>65.  Then who is there
that could fail to perceive from what a vein of conceit it proceeds,
that in explaining as it were the declaration of the apostle, he says,
"He who said, ‘I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase,’
surely meant nothing else than this, that ‘I made a man a catechumen in
Christ, Apollo baptized him; God confirmed what we had done?’"  Why then
did not Petilianus add what the apostle added, and I especially took
pains to quote, "So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither
he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase"? <span
id="fr_2445"></span>[2446](#fn_2445)   And if he be willing to interpret
this on the same principle as what he has set down above, it follows
beyond all doubt, that neither is he that baptizeth anything but God
that giveth the increase.  For what matter does it make in reference to
the question now before us, in what sense it has been said, "I planted,
Apollos watered,"—whether it is really to be taken as equivalent to his
saying, "I made a catechumen, Apollos baptized him;" or whether there be
any other truer and more congruous understanding of it?—for in the mean
time, according to his own interpretation of the words, neither is he
that makes the catechumen anything, neither he that baptizes, but God
that gives the increase.  But there is a great difference between
confirming what another does, and doing anything oneself.  For He who
gives the increase does not confirm a tree or a vine, but creates it. 
For by that increase it comes to pass that even a piece of wood planted
in the ground produces and establishes a root; by that increase it comes
to pass that a seed cast into the earth puts forth a shoot.  But why
should we make a longer dissertation on this point?  It is enough that,
according to Petilianus himself neither he that maketh a catechumen, nor
he that baptizes, is anything, but God that gives the increase.  But
when would Petilianus say this, so that we should understand that he
meant, Neither is <span id="page_625">p. 625</span> <span
id="v.v.v.liii-Page_625"></span>Donatus of Carthage anything, neither
Januarius, neither Petilianus?  When would the swelling of his pride
permit him to say this, which now causes the man to think himself to be
something, when he is nothing, deceiving himself? <span
