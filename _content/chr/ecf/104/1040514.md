id="v.v.iv.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—</span>62.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xxvii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"It will be urged against us, that the Apostle Paul said, ‘One Lord, one
faith, one baptism.’ <span id="fr_2058"></span>[2059](#fn_2058)   We
profess that there is only one; for it is certain that those who declare
that there are two are mad."

<span id="v.v.iv.xxvii-p3"></span>63.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxvii-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> replied:  These words of
yours are arguments against yourselves; but in your madness you are not
aware of it.  For the men who say there are two baptisms are those who
declare their opinion that the just and the unjust have different
baptisms; whereas it belongs neither to one party nor the other, but in
both of them is one, being Christ’s, although they themselves are not
one:  and yet the baptism, which is one, the just have to salvation, the
unjust to their destruction.
