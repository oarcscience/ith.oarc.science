&#160; It is true that Christ&#146;s baptism is holy; and although it may exist among heretics or schismatics, yet it does not belong to the heresy or schism; and therefore even those who come from thence to the Catholic Church herself ought not to be baptized afresh.&#160; Yet to err on this point is one thing; it is another thing that those who are straying from the peace of the Church, and have fallen headlong into the pit of schism, should go on to decide that any who join them ought   to be baptized again.&#160; For the former is a speck on the brightness of a holy soul which abundance of charity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1207"></A><A HREF="#fn_1207"><FONT SIZE="1">1208</FONT></A>
 would fain have covered; the latter is a stain in their nether foulness which the hatred of peace in their countenance ostentatiously brings to light.&#160; But the subject for our further consideration, relating to the authority of the blessed Cyprian, we will commence from a fresh beginning.</p>
