<span id="v.v.v.ii"></span>

<span id="v.v.v.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—</span>3.  Hear therefore, all ye
who have read his revilings, what Petilianus has vented against me with
more anger than consideration.  To begin with, I will address you in the
words of the apostle, which certainly are true, whatever I myself may
be:  "Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ, and
stewards of the mysteries of God.  Moreover, it is required in stewards,
that a man be found faithful.  But with me it is a very small thing that
I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment:  yea, I judge not mine
own self."  With regard to what immediately follows, although I do not
venture to apply to myself the words, "For I am conscious of nothing in
myself," <span id="fr_2321"></span>[2322](#fn_2321) yet I say
confidently in the sight of God, that I am conscious in myself of none
of those charges which Petilianus has brought against my life since the
time when I was baptized in Christ; "yet am I not hereby justified, but
He that judgeth me is the Lord.  Therefore judge nothing before the
time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden
things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts;
and then shall every man have praise of God.  And these things,
brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself; that ye might learn
in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of
you be puffed up for one against another." <span
id="fr_2322"></span>[2323](#fn_2322)   "Therefore let no man glory in
men:  for all things are yours; and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is
God’s." <span id="fr_2323"></span>[2324](#fn_2323)   Again I say, "Let
no man glory in men;" nay, oftentimes I repeat it, "Let no man glory in
men."  If you perceive anything in us which is deserving of praise,
refer it all to His praise, from whom is every good gift and every
perfect gift; for it is "from above, and cometh down from the Father of
lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning." <span
id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324)   For what have we which we did not
receive? and if we have received it, let us not boast as though we had
not received it. <span id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325)   And in all
these things which you know to be good in us, be ye our followers, at
any rate, if we are Christ’s; <span id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326)
but if, on the other hand, you either suspect, or believe, or see that
any evil is in us, hold fast to that saying of the Lord’s, in which you
may safely resolve not to desert His Church because of men’s ill deeds. 
Whatsoever we bid you observe, that observe and do; but whatsoever evil
works you think or know to be in us, those do ye not. <span
id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327)   For this is not the time for me
to justify myself before you, when I have undertaken, neglecting all
considerations of self, to recommend to you what is for your salvation,
that no one should make his boast of men.  For "cursed be the man that
trusteth in man." <span id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328)   So long
as this precept of the Lord and His apostle be adhered to and observed,
the cause which I serve will be victorious, even if I myself, as my
enemy would fain have thought, am faint and oppressed in my own cause. 
For if you cling most firmly to what I urge on you with all my might,
that every one is cursed who places his trust in man, so that none
should make his boast of man, then you will in no wise desert the
threshing-floor of the Lord on account of the chaff which either is now
being dispersed beneath the blast of the wind of pride, or will be
separated by the final winnowing; <span
id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329) nor will you fly from the great
house on account of the vessels made to dishonor; <span
id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330) nor will you quit the net through
the breaches made in it because of the bad fish which are to be
separated on the shore; <span id="fr_2331"></span>[2332](#fn_2331) nor
will you leave the good pastures of unity, because of the goats which
are to be placed on the left when the Good Shepherd shall divide the
flock; <span id="fr_2332"></span>[2333](#fn_2332) nor will you separate
yourselves <span id="page_598">p. 598</span> <span
id="v.v.v.ii-Page_598"></span>by an impious secession, because of the
mixture of the tares, from the society of that good wheat, whose source
is that grain that dies and is multiplied thereby, and that grows
together throughout the world until the harvest.  For the field is the
world,—not only Africa; and the harvest is the end of the world, <span
id="fr_2333"></span>[2334](#fn_2333) —not the era of Donatus.
