<span id="v.iv.iii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—</span>13.  But they think
within themselves that they show very great subtlety in asking whether
the baptism of Christ in the party of Donatus makes men sons or not; so
that, if we allow that it does make them sons, they may assert that
theirs is the Church, the mother which could give birth to sons in the
baptism of Christ; and since the Church must be one, they may allege
that ours is no Church.  But if we say that it does not make them sons,
"Why then," say they, "do you not cause those who pass from us to you to
be born again in baptism, after they have been baptized with us, if they
are not thereby born as yet?"

<span id="v.iv.iii.x-p2"></span>14.  Just as though their party gained
the power of generation in virtue of what constitutes its division, and
not from what causes its union with the Church.  For it is severed from
the bond of peace and charity, but it is joined in one baptism.  And so
there is one Church which alone is called Catholic; and <span
id="page_418">p. 418</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii.x-Page_418"></span>whenever it has anything of its own in
these communions of different bodies which are separate from itself, it
is most certainly in virtue of this which is its own in each of them
that it, not they, has the power of generation.  For neither is it their
separation that generates, but what they have retained of the essence of
the Church; and if they were to go on to abandon this, they would lose
the power of generation.  The generation, then, in each case proceeds
from the Church, whose sacraments are retained, from which any such
birth can alone in any case proceed,—although not all who receive its
birth belong to its unity, which shall save those who persevere even to
the end.  Nor is it those only that do not belong to it who are openly
guilty of the manifest sacrilege of schism, but also those who, being
outwardly joined to its unity, are yet separated by a life of sin.  For
the Church had herself given birth to Simon Magus through the sacrament
of baptism; and yet it was declared to him that he had no part in the
inheritance of Christ. <span id="fr_1171"></span>[1172](#fn_1171)   Did
he lack anything in respect of baptism, of the gospel, of the
sacraments?  But in that he wanted charity, he was born in vain; and
perhaps it had been well for him that he had never been born at all. 
Was anything wanting to their birth to whom the apostle says, "I have
fed you with milk, and not with meat, even as babes in Christ"?  Yet he
recalls them from the sacrilege of schism, into which they were rushing,
because they were carnal:  "I have fed you," he says, "with milk, and
not with meat:  for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet
now are ye able.  For ye are yet carnal:  for whereas there is among you
envying and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?  For while one
saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not
men?" <span id="fr_1172"></span>[1173](#fn_1172)   For of these he says
above:  "Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions
among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind,
and in the same judgment.  For it hath been declared unto me of you, my
brethren, by them which are of the house of Chlöe, that there are
contentions among you.  Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I
am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.  Is
Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the
name of Paul?" <span id="fr_1173"></span>[1174](#fn_1173)   These,
therefore, if they continued in the same perverse obstinacy, were
doubtless indeed born, but yet would not belong by the bond of peace and
unity to the very Church in respect of which they were born.  Therefore
she herself bears them in her own womb and in the womb of her handmaids,
by virtue of the same sacraments, as though by virtue of the seed of her
husband.  For it is not without meaning that the apostle says that all
these things were done by way of figure.  <span
id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174)   But those who are too proud, and
are not joined to their lawful mother, are like Ishmael, of whom it is
said, "Cast out this bond-woman and her Son:  for the son of the
bond-woman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac." <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[1176](#fn_1175)   But those who peacefully love the
lawful wife of their father, whose sons they are by lawful descent, are
like the sons of Jacob, born indeed of handmaids, but yet receiving the
same inheritance. <span id="fr_1176"></span>[1177](#fn_1176)   But those
who are born within the family, of the womb of the mother herself, and
then neglect the grace they have received, are like Isaac’s son Esau,
who was rejected, God Himself bearing witness to it, and saying, "I
loved Jacob, and I hated Esau;" <span
id="fr_1177"></span>[1178](#fn_1177) and that though they were
twin-brethren, the offspring of the same womb.
