<span id="v.iv.ix.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 43.—</span>84.  Clarus of
Mascula <span id="fr_1868"></span>[1869](#fn_1868) said:  "The sentence
of our Lord Jesus Christ is manifest, when He sent forth His apostles,
and gave the power which had been given Him of His Father to them alone,
whose successors we are, governing the Church of the Lord with the same
power, and baptizing those who believe the faith.  And therefore
heretics, who, being without, have neither power nor the Church of
Christ, cannot baptize any one with His baptism." <span
id="fr_1869"></span>[1870](#fn_1869)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xliii-p4"></span>85.  Are, then, ill-affectioned
murderers successors of the apostles?  Why, then, do they baptize?  Is
it because they are not outside?  But they are outside the rock, to
which the Lord gave the keys, and on which He said that He would build
His Church. <span id="fr_1870"></span>[1871](#fn_1870)
