 said:&#160; "When a revelation has been made of the truth, error must give way to truth; inasmuch as Peter also, who before was wont to circumcise, gave way to Paul when he declared the truth."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1815"></A><A HREF="#fn_1815"><FONT SIZE="1">1816</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.ix.xx-p4"></A>39.&#160; The answer is:&#160; This may also be considered as the expression of our judgment too, and this is just what has been done in respect of this question of baptism.&#160; For after that the truth had been more clearly revealed, error gave way to truth, when that most wholesome custom was further confirmed by the authority of a plenary Council.&#160; It is well, however, that they so constantly bear in mind that it was possible even for Peter, the chief of the apostles, to have   been at one time minded otherwise than the truth required; which we believe, without any disrespect to Cyprian, to have been the case with him, and that with all our love for Cyprian, for it is not right that he should be loved with greater love than Peter.</p>
