<span id="v.v.iv.liii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 53.—</span>121.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.liii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"If you make prayer to God, or utter supplication, it profits you
absolutely nothing whatsoever.  For your blood-stained conscience makes
your feeble prayers of no effect; because the Lord God regards purity of
conscience more than the words of supplication, according to the saying
of the Lord Christ, ‘Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall
enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my
Father which is in heaven.’ <span id="fr_2140"></span>[2141](#fn_2140)  
The will of God unquestionably is good, for therefore we pray as follows
in the holy prayer, ‘Thy will be done in earth, as it is in
heaven,’ <span id="fr_2141"></span>[2142](#fn_2141) that, as His will is
good, so it may confer on us whatever may be good.  You therefore do not
do the will of God, because you do what is evil every day."

<span id="v.v.iv.liii-p4"></span>122.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.liii-p4.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  If we on our
side were to utter against you all that you assert against us, would not
any one who heard us consider that we were rather insane litigants than
Christian disputants, if he himself were in his senses?  We do not,
there<span id="page_562">p. 562</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.liii-Page_562"></span>fore, render for railing.  For it is
not fitting that the servant of the Lord should strive; but he should be
gentle unto all men, willing to learn, in meekness instructing those
that oppose themselves. <span id="fr_2142"></span>[2143](#fn_2142)   If,
therefore, we reproach you with those who daily do what is evil among
you, we are guilty of striving unbefittingly, accusing one for the sins
of another.  But if we admonish you, that as you are unwilling that
these things should be brought against yourselves, so you should abstain
from bringing against us the sins of other men, we then in meekness are
instructing you, solely in the hope that some time you will return to a
better mind.
