<span id="v.iv.viii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—</span>22.  Lucius of Castra
Galbæ <span id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626) said:  "Since the Lord
hath said in His gospel, ‘Ye are the salt of the earth:  but if the salt
have lost his savor, that which is salted from it shall be thenceforth
good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of
men;’ <span id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627) and seeing that again,
after His resurrection, when sending forth His apostles, He commanded
them, saying, ‘All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth:  go ye
therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,’ <span
id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628) —since then it is plain that
heretics, that is, the enemies of Christ, have not the full confession
of the sacrament, also that schismatics cannot reason with spiritual
wisdom, since they themselves, by withdrawing when they have lost their
savor from the Church, which is one, have become contrary to it, <span
id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629) let that be done which is written,
‘The houses of those that are opposed to the law must needs be
cleansed;’ <span id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630) and it therefore
follows that those who have been polluted by being baptized by men
opposed to Christ should first be cleansed, and only then
baptized." <span id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xiv-p8"></span>23.  Lucius of Castra Galbæ has
brought forward a proof from the gospel, in the words of the Lord, "Ye
are the salt of the earth:  but if the salt have lost his savor, that
which is salted from it shall be good for nothing, but to be cast out,
and to be trodden under foot of men;" just as though we maintained that
men when cast out were of any profit for the salvation either of
themselves or of any one else.  But those also who, though seeming to be
within, are yet of such a kind, not only are without spiritually, but
will in the end be separated in the body also.  For all such are for
nothing.  But it does not therefore follow that the sacrament of baptism
which is in them is nothing.  For even in the very men who are cast out,
if they return to their senses and come back, the salvation which had
departed from them returns; but the baptism does not return, because it
never had departed.  And in what the Lord says, "Go therefore, and teach
all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost," He did not permit any to baptize except the
good, inasmuch as He did not say to the bad, "Whosesoever sins ye remit,
they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are
retained." <span id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632)   How then do the
wicked baptize within, who cannot remit sins?  How also is it that they
baptize the wicked whose hearts are not changed, whose sins are yet upon
them, as John says, "He that hateth his brother is in darkness even
until now?" <span id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633)   But if the sins
of these men are remitted when they join themselves in the close bonds
of love to the good and just, through whom sins are remitted in the
Church, though they have been baptized by the wicked, so the sins of
those also are remitted who come from without and join themselves by the
inner bond of peace to the same framework of the body of Christ.  Yet
the baptism of Christ should be acknowledged in both, and held invalid
in none, whether before they are converted, though then it profit them
nothing, or after they are converted, that so it may profit them, as he
says, "Since they themselves, by withdrawing when they have lost their
savor from the Church, which is one, have become contrary to it, let
that be done which is written, ‘The houses of those that are opposed to
the law must need be cleansed.’  And it therefore follows," he goes on
to say, "that those who have been polluted by being baptized by men
opposed to Christ should first be cleansed, and only then baptized." 
What then?  Are thieves <span id="page_487">p. 487</span> <span
id="v.iv.viii.xiv-Page_487"></span>and murderers not contrary to the
law, which says, "Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not steal?" <span
id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634)   "They must therefore needs be
cleansed."  Who will deny it?  And yet not only those who are baptized
by such within the Church, but also those who, being such themselves,
are baptized without being changed in heart, are nevertheless exempt
from further baptism when they are so changed.  So great is the force of
the sacrament of mere baptism, that though we allow that a man who has
been baptized and continues to lead an evil life requires to be
cleansed, we yet forbid him to be any more baptized.
