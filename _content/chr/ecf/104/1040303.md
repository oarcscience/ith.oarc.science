<span id="v.iv.vi.v"></span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—</span>8.  "Further," Cyprian goes
on to say, "in vain do some, who are overcome by reason, oppose to us
custom, as though custom were superior to truth, or that were not to be
followed in spiritual things which has been revealed by the Holy Spirit,
as the better way." <span id="fr_1357"></span>[1358](#fn_1357)   This is
clearly true, since reason and truth are to be preferred to custom.  But
when truth supports custom, nothing should be more strongly maintained. 
Then he proceeds as follows:  "For one may pardon a man who merely errs,
as the Apostle Paul says of himself, ‘Who was before a blasphemer, a
persecutor, and injurious; but I obtained mercy, because I did it
ignorantly;’ <span id="fr_1358"></span>[1359](#fn_1358) but he who,
after inspiration and revelation given, perseveres advisedly and
knowingly in his former error, sins without hope of pardon on the ground
of ignorance.  For he rests on a kind of presumption and obstinacy, when
he is overcome by reason."  This is most true, that his sin is much more
grievous who has sinned wittingly than his who has sinned through
ignorance.  And so in the case of the holy Cyprian, who was not only
learned, but also patient of instruction, which he so fully himself
understood to be a part of the praise of the bishop whom the apostle
describes, <span id="fr_1359"></span>[1360](#fn_1359) that he said,
"This also should be approved in a bishop, that he not only teach with
knowledge, but also learn with patience." <span
id="fr_1360"></span>[1361](#fn_1360)   I do not doubt that if he had had
the opportunity of discussing this question, which has been so long and
so much disputed in the Church, with the pious and learned men to whom
we owe it that subsequently that ancient custom was confirmed by the
authority of a plenary Council, he would have shown, without hesitation,
not only how learned he was in those things which he had grasped with
all the security of truth, but also how ready he was to receive
instruction in what he had failed to perceive.  And yet, since it is so
clear that it is much more grievous to sin wittingly than in ignorance,
I should be glad if any one would tell me which is the worse,—the man
who falls into heresy, not knowing how great a sin it is, or the man who
refuses to abandon his covetousness, knowing its enormity?  I might even
put the question thus:  If one man unwittingly fall into heresy, and
another knowingly refuse to depart from idolatry, since the apostle
himself says, "The covetous man, which is an idolater;" and Cyprian too
understood the same passage in just the same way, when he says, in his
letter to Antonianus, "Nor let the new heretics flatter themselves in
this, that they say they do not communicate with idolaters, whereas
there are amongst them both adulterers and covetous persons, who are
held guilty of the sin of idolatry; ‘for know this, and understand, that
no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an
idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of
God;’ <span id="fr_1361"></span>[1362](#fn_1361) and again, ‘Mortify
therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication,
uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness,
which is idolatry.’" <span id="fr_1362"></span>[1363](#fn_1362)   I ask,
therefore, which sins more deeply,—he who ignorantly has fallen into
heresy, or he who wittingly has refused to abandon covetousness, that is
idolatry?  According to that rule by which the sins of those who sin
wittingly are placed before those of the ignorant, the man who is
covetous with knowledge takes the first place in sin.  But as it is
possible that the greatness of the actual sin should produce the same
effect in the case of heresy that the witting commission of the sin
produces in that of covetousness, let us suppose the ignorant heretic to
be on <span id="page_450">p. 450</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.v-Page_450"></span>a par in guilt with the consciously
covetous man, although the evidence which Cyprian himself has advanced
from the apostle does not seem to prove this.  For what is it that we
abominate in heretics except their blasphemies?  But when he wished to
show that ignorance of the sin may conduce to ease in obtaining pardon,
he advanced a proof from the case of the apostle, when he says, "Who was
before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious; but I obtained
mercy, because I did it ignorantly." <span
id="fr_1363"></span>[1364](#fn_1363)   But if possible, as I said
before, let the sins of the two men—the blasphemy of the unconscious,
and the idolatry of the conscious sinner—be esteemed of equal weight;
and let them be judged by the same sentence,—he who, in seeking for
Christ, falls into a truth-like setting forth of what is false, and he
who wittingly resists Christ speaking through His apostle, "seeing that
no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, which is an
idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of
God," <span id="fr_1364"></span>[1365](#fn_1364) —and then I would ask
why baptism and the words of the gospel are held as naught in the former
case, and accounted valid in the latter, when each is alike found to be
estranged from the members of the dove.  Is it because the former is an
open combatant outside, that he should not be admitted, the latter a
cunning assenter within the fold, that he may not be expelled?
