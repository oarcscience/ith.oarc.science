<p class="c10"><a name="iv.viii.iii-p2"></A>2.&#160; Let those rage against you who know not with what labor the truth is to be found and with what difficulty error is to be avoided.&#160; Let those rage against you who know not how rare and hard it is to overcome the fancies of the flesh by the serenity of a pious disposition.&#160; Let those rage against you who know not the difficulty of curing the eye of the inner man that he may gaze upon his Sun,&#8212;not that sun <A NAME="page_130"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 130</FONT></A> <a name="iv.viii.iii-Page_130"></A>which you worship, and which shines with the brilliance of a heavenly body in the eyes of carnal men and of beasts,&#8212;but that of which it is written through the prophet, "The Sun of righteousness has arisen upon me;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_264"></A><A HREF="#fn_264"><FONT SIZE="1">265</FONT></A>
 and of which it is said in the gospel, "That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_265"></A><A HREF="#fn_265"><FONT SIZE="1">266</FONT></A>
&#160; Let those rage against you who know not with what sighs and groans the least particle of the knowledge of God is obtained.&#160; And, last of all, let those rage against you who have never been led astray in the same way that they see that you are.</p>
