<span id="v.iv.viii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—</span>13.  The elder
Felix <span id="fr_1605"></span>[1606](#fn_1605) of Migirpa said:  "I
think that every one coming from heresy should be baptized.  For in vain
does any one suppose that he has been baptized there, seeing that there
is no baptism save the one true baptism in the Church; for there is one
Lord, and one faith, and one Church, in which rests the one baptism, and
holiness, and the rest.  For the things that are practised without have
no power to work salvation."

<span id="v.iv.viii.ix-p3"></span>14.  To what Felix of Migirpa said we
answer as follows.  If the one true baptism did not exist except in the
Church, it surely would not exist in those who depart from unity.  But
it does exist in them, since they do not <span id="page_484">p.
484</span> <span id="v.iv.viii.ix-Page_484"></span>receive it when they
return, simply because they had not lost it when they departed.  But as
regards his statement, that "the things that are practised without have
no power to work salvation," I agree with him, and think that it is
quite true; for it is one thing that baptism should not be there, and
another that it should have no power to work salvation.  For when men
come to the peace of the Catholic Church, then what was in them before
they joined it, but did not profit them, begins at once to profit them.

<span id="v.iv.viii.ix-p2"></span> This section is wanting in the <span

edition of Amerbach, so that it has been supposed to have been added by
Erasmus from Cyprian (Conc. Carth. sec. 2),—the name of Felix (really
Primus), which is not found in Cyprian, being derived from the following
section of Augustin.  So Hartel:  *Primas a Misgirpa dixit*.  Migirpa or
Misgirpa, was in Zeugitana.  This Primus is seemingly identical with the
Primus of Cypr. Epp. 67 (following Cæcilius), and 70 (preceding
Cæcilius).
