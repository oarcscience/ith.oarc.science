&#160; When he gives this warning, O ye miserable men, why do you sit in that seat?&#160; &#145;But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in His law doth he meditate day and night.&#160; And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season:&#160; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.&#160; The ungodly are not so:&#160; but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.&#146;&#160; He blindeth their eyes, so that they should not   see.&#160; &#145;Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.&#160; For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous:&#160; but the way of the ungodly shall perish.&#146;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2124"></A><A HREF="#fn_2124"><FONT SIZE="1">2125</FONT></A>
