<span id="v.iv.vii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—</span>2.  But now that we have
begun a disputation with a man of peace like Cyprian, let us go on.  For
when he had brought an objection against himself, which he knew was
urged by his brethren, "What then will become of those who in times
past, coming to the Church from heresy, were admitted without baptism? 
The Lord," he answers, "is able of His mercy to grant indulgence, and
not to separate from the gifts of His Church those who, being admitted
in all honesty to His Church, have fallen asleep within the
Church." <span id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470)   Well indeed has he
assumed that charity can cover the multitude of sins.  But if they
really had baptism, and this were not rightly perceived by those who
thought that they should be baptized again, that error was covered by
the charity of unity so long as it contained, not the discord and spirit
of the devil, but merely human infirmity, until, as the apostle says,
"if they were otherwise minded, the Lord should reveal it to
them." <span id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471)   But woe unto those
who, being torn asunder from unity by a sacrilegious rupture, either
rebaptize, if baptism exists with both us and them, or do not baptize at
all, if baptism exist in the Catholic Church only.  Whether, therefore,
they rebaptize, or fail to baptize, they are not in the bond of peace;
wherefore let them apply a remedy to which they please of these two
wounds.  But if we admit to the Church without baptism, we are of the
number of those who, as Cyprian has assumed, may receive pardon because
they preserved unity.  But if (as is, I think, already clear from what
has been said in the earlier books) Christian baptism can preserve its
integrity even amid the perversity of heretics, then even though any in
those times did rebaptize, yet without departing from the bond of unity,
they might still attain to pardon in virtue of that same love of peace,
through which Cyprian bears witness that those admitted even without
baptism might obtain that they should not be separated from the gifts of
the Church.  Further, if it is true that with heretics and schismatics
the baptism of Christ does not exist, how much less could the sins of
others hurt those who were fixed in unity, if even men’s own sins were
forgiven when they came to it even without baptism!  For if, according
to Cyprian, the bond of unity is of such efficacy, how could they be
hurt by other men’s sins, who were unwilling to separate themselves from
unity, if even the unbaptized, who wished to come to it from heresy,
thereby escaped the destruction due to their own sins?
