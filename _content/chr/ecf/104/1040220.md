id="iv.x.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36.—No Creature of God is Evil,
But to Abuse a Creature of God is Evil.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xxxviii-p2"></span>For who is so foolish as to think a
creature of God, especially one planted in Paradise, blameworthy; when
indeed not even thorns and thistles, which the earth brought forth,
according to the judiciary judgment of God, for wearing out the sinner
in labor, should be blamed?  For even such herbs have their measure and
form and order, which whoever considers soberly will find praiseworthy;
but they are evil to that nature which ought thus to be restrained as a
recompense for sin.  Therefore, as I have said, sin is not the striving
after an evil nature, but the desertion of a better, and so the deed
itself is evil, not the nature which the sinner uses amiss.  For it is
evil to use amiss that which is good.  Whence the apostle reproves
certain ones as condemned by divine judgment, "Who have worshipped and
served the creature more than the Creator." <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129)   He does not reprove the creature,
which he who should do would act injuriously towards the Creator, but
those who, deserting the better, have used amiss the good.
