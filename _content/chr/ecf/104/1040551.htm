<p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.lxiv-p2"></A>144.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.lxiv-p2.1"></A>Augustin</span> answered:&#160; Again and again you may hear the Lord saying, "Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and even in the whole earth."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2157"></A><A HREF="#fn_2157"><FONT SIZE="1">2158</FONT></A>
&#160; How is it, then, that those men have not lost heaven and earth, who, in order to avoid communicating with all the nations of the earth, despise the words of Him that sitteth in heaven?&#160; For, in proof of your meekness, it is not your words but the cudgels of the Circumcelliones which should be examined.&#160; You will say, What has that to do with us?&#160; Just as though we were making the remark with any other object except to extract that answer from you.&#160; For the reason that   your schism is a valid charge against you is that you do not allow that you are chargeable with another&#146;s sin, whereas you have separated from us for no other reason but that you charge us with the sins of other men.</p>
