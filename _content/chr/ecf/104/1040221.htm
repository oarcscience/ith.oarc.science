<p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.xxxix-p2"></A>Accordingly, if all natures should guard their own proper measure and form and order, there would be no evil:&#160; but if any one should wish to misuse these good things, not even thus does he vanquish the will of God, who knows how to order righteously even the unrighteous; so that if they themselves through the iniquity of their will should misuse His good things, He through the righteousness of His power may use their evil deeds, rightly ordaining to punishment those who have perversely ordained themselves to sins.</p>
