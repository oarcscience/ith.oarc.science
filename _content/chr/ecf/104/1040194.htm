<p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.xii-p2"></A>All corruptible natures therefore are natures at all only so far as they are <i>from</i> God, nor would they be corruptible if they were <i>of</i> Him; because they would be what He himself is.&#160; Therefore of whatever measure, of whatever form, of whatever order, they are, they are so because it is God by whom they were made; but they are not immutable, because it is nothing of which they were made.&#160; For it is sacrilegious audacity to make nothing and God equal, as when we wish to make what has been born of God such as what has been made by Him out of nothing.</p>
