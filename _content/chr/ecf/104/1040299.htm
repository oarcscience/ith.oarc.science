 shows us that men may indeed receive her baptism outside her pale, but that no one outside can either receive or retain the salvation of eternal happiness.&#160; For, as the words of Scripture testify, the streams from the fountain of Paradise flowed copiously even beyond its bounds.&#160; Record indeed is made of their names; and through what countries they flow, and that they are situated beyond the limits of Paradise, is known to all;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1333"></A><A HREF="#fn_1333"><FONT SIZE="1">1334</FONT></A>
 and yet in Mesopotamia, and in Egypt, to which countries those rivers extended, there is not found that blessedness of life which is recorded in Paradise.&#160; Accordingly, though the waters of Paradise are found beyond its boundaries, yet its happiness is in Paradise alone.&#160; So, therefore, the baptism of the Church may exist outside, but the gift of the life of happiness is found alone within the Church, which has been founded on a rock, which has received the keys of binding   and loosing.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1334"></A><A HREF="#fn_1334"><FONT SIZE="1">1335</FONT></A>
&#160; "She it is alone who holds as her privilege the whole power of her Bridegroom and Lord;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1335"></A><A HREF="#fn_1335"><FONT SIZE="1">1336</FONT></A>
 by virtue of which power as bride, she can bring forth sons even of handmaids.&#160; And these, if they be not high-minded, shall be called into the lot of the inheritance; but if they be high-minded, they shall remain outside.</p>
