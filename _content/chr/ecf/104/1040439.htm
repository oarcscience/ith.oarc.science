<p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.ix.xl-p4"></A>79.&#160; Our answer is:&#160; On this theory, the very men who founded heresies are not heretics themselves, because they separated themselves from the Church, and certainly they previously had what they received there.&#160; But if it is absurd to say that those are not heretics through whom the rest became heretics, it is therefore possible that a heretic should have what turns to his destruction through his evil use of it.</p>
