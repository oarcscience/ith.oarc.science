<span id="v.iv.viii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—</span>51.  Privatus of
Sufes <span id="fr_1688"></span>[1689](#fn_1688) said:  "What can be
said of the man who approves the baptism of heretics, save that he
communicates with heretics?" <span id="fr_1689"></span>[1690](#fn_1689)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxvii-p4"></span>52.  To this we answer:  It is not
the baptism of heretics which we approve in heretics, as it is not the
baptism of the covetous, or the treacherous, or deceitful, or of
robbers, or of envious men which we approve in them; for all of these
are unjust, but Christ is just, whose sacrament existing in them, they
do not in its essence violate.  Otherwise another man might say:  What
can be said of the man who approves the baptism of the unjust, save that
he communicates with the unjust.  And if this objection were brought
against the Catholic Church herself, it would be answered just as I have
answered the above.
