<span id="v.v.iii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—</span>17.  As for the words
which follow in his letter, the writer himself could scarcely fail to
laugh at them, when, having made an unlearned and lying use of the proof
in which he quotes the words of Scripture, "He who is washed by the
dead, what profiteth him his washing?" he endeavors to show to us "how
far a *traditor* being still in life may be accounted dead."  And then
he goes on further to say:  "That man is dead who has not been worthy to
be born again in true baptism; he is likewise dead who, although born in
genuine baptism, has joined himself to a *traditor*."  If, therefore,
the followers of Maximianus are not dead, why do the Donatists say, in
their plenary Council, that "the shores are covered with their dying
bodies?"  But if they are dead, whence is there life in the baptism
which they gave?  Again, if Maximianus is not dead, why is a man
baptized again who had been baptized by him?  But if he is dead why is
not also Felicianus of Musti dead with him, who ordained him, and might
have died beyond the sea with some African colleague or another who was
a *traditor*?  Or, if he also is himself dead, how is there life with
him in your society in those who, having been baptized outside by him
who is dead, have never been baptized again within?
