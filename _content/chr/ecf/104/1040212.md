id="iv.x.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—Sin Not From God, But From The
Will of Those Sinning.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xxx-p2"></span>But when we hear:  "All things are from
Him, and through Him, and in Him," we ought assuredly to understand all
natures which naturally exist.  For sins, which do not preserve but
vitiate nature, are not from Him; which sins, Holy Scripture in many
ways testifies, are from the will of those sinning, especially in the
passage where the apostle says:  "But dost thou suppose this, O man,
that judgest those who do such things, and doest them, that thou shall
escape the judgment of God?  Or dost thou despise the riches of His
goodness, and patience, and long-suffering, not knowing that the
patience of God leadeth thee to repentance?  But according to the
hardness of thy heart and thy impenitent heart, thou treasurest up for
thyself wrath against the day of wrath and of the revelation of the just
judgment of God, who will render unto every one according to his
works." <span id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108)
