<span id="v.iv.v.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.v.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—</span>18.  But as regards the
remission of sins, whether it is granted through baptism at the hands of
the heretics, I have already expressed my opinion on this point in a
former book; <span id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285) but I will
shortly recapitulate it here.  If remission of sins is there conferred
by the sacredness of baptism, the sins return again through obstinate
perseverance in heresy or schism; and therefore such men must needs
return to the peace of the Catholic Church, that they may cease to be
heretics and schismatics, and deserve that those sins which had returned
on them should be cleansed away by love working in the bond of unity. 
But if, although among heretics and schismatics it be still the same
baptism of Christ, it yet cannot work remission of sins owing to this
same foulness of discord and <span id="page_441">p. 441</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xiii-Page_441"></span>wickedness of dissent, then the same
baptism begins to be of avail for the remission of sins when they come
to the peace of the Church,—\[not\] <span
id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286) that what has been already truly
remitted should not be retained; nor that heretical baptism should be
repudiated as belonging to a different religion, or as being different
from our own, so that a second baptism should be administered; but that
the very same baptism, which was working death by reason of discord
outside the Church, may work salvation by reason of the peace within. 
It was, in fact, the same savor of which the apostle says, "We are a
sweet savor of Christ in every place;" and yet, says he, "both in them
that are saved and in them that perish.  To the one we are the savor of
life unto life; and to the other the savor of death unto death." <span
id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287)   And although he used these words
with reference to another subject, I have applied them to this, that men
may understand that what is good may not only work life to those who use
it aright, but also death to those who use it wrong.

<span id="v.iv.v.xiii-p3"></span> *Non ut jam vere dimissa non
retineantur*.  One of the negatives here appears to be superfluous, and
the former is omitted in Amerbach’s edition, and in many of the <span
class="c11"><span id="v.iv.v.xiii-p3.1"></span>Mss.</span>, which
continue the sentence, "*non ut ille baptismus,*" instead of "*neque ut
ille,*" etc.  If the latter negative were omitted, the sense would be
improved, and "*neque*" would appropriately remain.
