<p class="c41"><a name="v.iv.iii.viii-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.iii.viii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 8.&#8212;</span>10.&#160; Nor indeed were the prayers of the Gentile Cornelius unheard, nor did his alms lack acceptance; nay, he was found worthy that an angel should be sent to him, and that he should behold the messenger, through whom he might assuredly have learned everything that was necessary, without requiring that any man should come to him.&#160; But since all the good that he had in his prayers and alms could not benefit him unless he were   incorporated in the Church by the bond of Christian brotherhood and peace, he was ordered to send to Peter, and through him learned Christ; and, being also baptized by his orders, he was joined by the tie of communion to the fellowship of Christians, to which before he was bound only by the likeness of good works.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1161"></A><A HREF="#fn_1161"><FONT SIZE="1">1162</FONT></A>
&#160; And indeed it would have been most fatal to despise what he did not yet possess, vaunting himself in what he had.&#160; So too those who, by separating themselves from the society of their fellows, to the overthrow of charity, thus break the bond of unity, if they observe none of the things which they have received in that society, are separated in everything; and so any one whom they have joined to their society, if he afterwards wish to come over to the Church, ought to   receive everything which he has not already received.&#160; But if they observe some of the same things, in respect of these they have not severed themselves; and so far they are still a part of the framework of the Church, while in all other respects they are cut off from it.&#160; Accordingly, any one whom they have associated with themselves is united to the Church in all those points in which they are not separated from it.&#160; And therefore, if he wish to come over to the Church, he is made sound in   those points in which he was unsound and went astray; but where he was sound in union with the Church, he is not cured, but recognized,&#8212;lest in desiring to cure what is sound we should rather inflict a wound.&#160; Therefore those whom they baptize they heal from the wound of idolatry or unbelief; but they injure them more seriously with the wound of schism. <A NAME="page_417"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 417</FONT></A> <a name="v.iv.iii.viii-Page_417"></A>For idolaters among the people of the Lord were smitten with the sword;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1162"></A><A HREF="#fn_1162"><FONT SIZE="1">1163</FONT></A>
 but schismatics were swallowed up by the earth opening her mouth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1163"></A><A HREF="#fn_1163"><FONT SIZE="1">1164</FONT></A>
&#160; And the apostle says, "Though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1164"></A><A HREF="#fn_1164"><FONT SIZE="1">1165</FONT></A>

<p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.iii.viii-p6"></A>11.&#160; If any one is brought to the surgeon, afflicted with a grievous wound in some vital part of the body, and the surgeon says that unless it is cured it must cause death, the friends who brought him do not, I presume, act so foolishly as to count over to the surgeon all his sound limbs, and, drawing his attention to them, make answer to him, "Can it be that all these sound limbs are of no avail to save his life, and that one wounded limb is enough to cause his   death?"&#160; They certainly do not say this, but they entrust him to the surgeon to be cured.&#160; Nor, again, because they so entrust him, do they ask the surgeon to cure the limbs that are sound as well; but they desire him to apply drugs with all care to the one part from which death is threatening the other sound parts too, with the certainty that it must come, unless the wound be healed.&#160; What will it then profit a man that he has sound faith, or perhaps only soundness in the sacrament of faith,   when the soundness of his charity is done away with by the fatal wound of schism, so that by the overthrow of it the other points, which were in themselves sound, are brought into the infection of death?&#160; To prevent which, the mercy of God, through the unity of His holy Church, does not cease striving that they may come and be healed by the medicine of reconciliation, through the bond of peace.&#160; And let them not think that they are sound because we admit that they have something sound in them;   nor let them think, on the other hand, that what is sound must needs be healed, because we show that in some parts there is a wound.&#160; So that in the soundness of the sacrament, because they are not against us, they are for us; but in the wound of schism, because they gather not with Christ, they scatter abroad.&#160; Let them not be exalted by what they have.&#160; Why do they pass the eyes of pride over those parts only which are sound?&#160; Let them condescend also to look humbly on their wound, and give   heed not only to what they have, but also to what is wanting in them.</p>
