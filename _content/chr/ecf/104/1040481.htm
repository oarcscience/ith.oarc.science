 called sacrilegious and vipers, and swift to shed blood, to be compared with Dathan and Abiram and Korah, and are condemned in cutting terms of abhorrence; and are as openly received again with undiminished honors in company with those whom they have baptized.&#160; Such are the fruits of these men, who do all this for the peace of Donatus, that they may clothe themselves in sheep&#146;s clothing, and reject the peace of Christ throughout the world that they may be ravening wolves   within the fold.</p>
