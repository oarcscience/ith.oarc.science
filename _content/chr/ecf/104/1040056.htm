<p class="c38"><a name="iv.iv.xxxvii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="iv.iv.xxxvii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 35.&#8212;Marriage and Property Allowed to the Baptized by the Apostles.</span></p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.iv.xxxvii-p2"></A>77.&#160; Meanwhile, why do you rage? why does party spirit blind your eyes?&#160; Why do you entangle yourselves in a long defence of such great error?&#160; Seek for fruit in the field, seek for wheat in the floor:&#160; they will be found easily, and will present themselves to the inquirer.&#160; Why do you look so exclusively at the dross?&#160; Why do you use the roughness of the hedge to scare away the inexperienced from the fatness of the garden?&#160; There is a proper entrance, though known to but a few; and by it men come in, though you disbelieve it, or do not wish to find it.&#160; In the Catholic Church there are believers without number who do not use the world, and there are those who "use it," in the words of the apostle, "as not using it,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_154"></A><A HREF="#fn_154"><FONT SIZE="1">155</FONT></A>
 as was proved in those times when Christians were forced to worship idols.&#160; For then, how many wealthy men, how many peasant householders, how many merchants, how many military men, how many leading men in their own cities, and how many senators, people of both sexes, giving up all these empty and transitory things, though while they used them they were not bound down by them, endured death for the salutary faith and religion, and proved to unbelievers that instead of being possessed by all these things they really possessed them?</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.iv.xxxvii-p4"></A>78.&#160; Why do you reproach us by saying that men renewed in baptism ought no longer to beget children, or to possess fields, and houses, and money?&#160; Paul allows it.&#160; For, as cannot be denied, he wrote to believers, after recounting many kinds of evil-doers who shall not possess the kingdom of God:&#160; "And such were you," he says:&#160; "but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in <A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iv.xxxvii-Page_63"></A>the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God."&#160; By the washed and sanctified, no one, assuredly, will venture to think any are meant but believers, and those who have renounced this world.&#160; But, after showing to whom he writes, let us see whether he allows these things to them.&#160; He goes on:&#160; "All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient:&#160; all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.&#160; Meat for the belly, and the belly for meats:&#160; but God will destroy both it and them.&#160; Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.&#160; But God raised up the Lord, and will raise us up also by His own power.&#160; Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot?&#160; God forbid.&#160; Know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is made one body? for the twain, saith He, shall be one flesh.&#160; But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#160; Flee fornication.&#160; Whatever sin a man doeth is without the body:&#160; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.&#160; Know ye not that your members are the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?&#160; For ye are bought with a great price:&#160; glorify God, and carry Him in your body."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_155"></A><A HREF="#fn_155"><FONT SIZE="1">156</FONT></A>
&#160; "But of the things concerning which ye wrote to me:&#160; it is good for a man not to touch a woman.&#160; Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.&#160; Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence:&#160; and likewise also the wife unto the husband.&#160; The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband:&#160; and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.&#160; Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may have leisure for prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.&#160; But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.&#160; For I would that all men were even as I myself:&#160; but every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_156"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">157</FONT></A>
</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.iv.xxxvii-p7"></A>79.&#160; Has the apostle, think you, both shown sufficiently to the strong what is highest, and permitted to the weaker what is next best?&#160; Not to touch a woman he shows is highest when he says, "I would that all men were even as I myself."&#160; But next to this highest is conjugal chastity, that man may not be the prey of fornication.&#160; Did he say that these people were not yet believers because they were married?&#160; Indeed, by this conjugal chastity he says that those who are united are sanctified by one another, if one of them is an unbeliever, and that their children also are sanctified.&#160; "The unbelieving husband," he says, "is sanctified by the believing wife, and the unbelieving woman by the believing husband:&#160; otherwise your children would be unclean; but now are they holy."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_157"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">158</FONT></A>
&#160; Why do you persist in opposition to such plain truth?&#160; Why do you try to darken the light of Scripture by vain shadows?</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.iv.xxxvii-p9"></A>80.&#160; Do not say that catechumens are allowed to have wives, but not believers; that catechumens may have money, but not believers.&#160; For there are many who use as not using.&#160; And in that sacred washing the renewal of the new man is begun so as gradually to reach perfection, in some more quickly, in others more slowly.&#160; The progress, however, to a new life is made in the case of many, if we view the matter without hostility, but attentively.&#160; As the apostle says of himself, "Though the outward man perish, the inward man is renewed day by day."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">159</FONT></A>
&#160; The apostle says that the inward man is renewed day by day that it may reach perfection; and you wish it to begin with perfection!&#160; And it were well if you did wish it.&#160; In reality, you aim not at raising the weak, but at misleading the unwary.&#160; You ought not to have spoken so arrogantly, even if it were known that you are perfect in your childish precepts.&#160; But when your conscience knows that those whom you bring into your sect, when they come to a more intimate acquaintance with you, will find many things in you which nobody hearing you accuse others would suspect, is it not great impertinence to demand perfection in the weaker Catholics, to turn away the inexperienced from the Catholic Church, while you show nothing of the kind in yourself to those thus turned away?&#160; But not to seem to inveigh against you without reason, I will now close this volume, and will proceed at last to set forth the precepts of your life and your notable customs.</p>
