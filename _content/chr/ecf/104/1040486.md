<span id="v.v.iii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29.—</span>31.  These things,
brethren, I would have you retain as the basis of your action and
preaching with untiring gentleness:  love men, while you destroy errors;
take of the truth without pride; strive for the truth without cruelty. 
Pray for those whom you refute and convince of error.  For the prophet
prays to God for mercy upon such as these, saying, "Fill their faces
with shame, that they may seek Thy name, O Lord."  <span
id="fr_1965"></span>[1966](#fn_1965)   And this, indeed, the Lord has
done already, so as to fill the faces of the followers of Maximianus
with shame in the sight of all mankind:  it only remains that they
should learn how to blush to their soul’s health.  For so they will be
able to seek the name of the Lord, from which they are turned away to
their utter destruction, whilst they exalt their own name in the place
of that of Christ.  May ye live and persevere in Christ, and be
multiplied, and abound in the love of God, and in love towards one
another, and towards all men, brethren well beloved.
