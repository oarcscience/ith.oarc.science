<p class="c10"><a name="iv.ii.x-p3"></A>In the <i>East</i> Mani&#146;s followers were involved in the persecution that resulted in his death, and many of them fled to Transoxiania.&#160; Their headquarters and the residence of the chief of the sect continued to be Babylon.&#160; They returned to Persia in 661, but were driven back, 908&#8211;32.&#160; They seem to have become very numerous in the Transoxiania.&#160; Alb&icirc;r&ucirc;n&icirc;, 973&#8211;1048, speaks of the Manich&aelig;ans as still existing in large numbers throughout all Mohammedan lands, and especially in the region of Samarkand, where they were known as Sabeans.&#160; He also relates that they were prevalent among the Eastern Turks, in China, Thibet and India.&#160; In Armenia and Cappadocia they gained many followers, and thence made their way into Europe.&#160; The Paulicians are commonly represented as a Manich&aelig;an party, but the descriptions that have come down to us would seem to indicate Marcionitic rather than Manich&aelig;an elements.&#160; Yet contemporary Catholic writers such as Peter Siculus and Photius constantly assail them as Manich&aelig;ans.</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.ii.x-p4"></A>In the <i>West</i> we have traces of their existence from 287 onwards.&#160; Diocletian, according to a somewhat doubtful tradition, condemned its leaders to the stake, and its adherents to decapitation with confiscation of goods.&#160; The edict is supposed to have been directed to the pro-consul of Africa where Manich&aelig;ans were making great progress.&#160; According to an early account, Mani sent a special envoy to Africa.&#160; Valentinian (372) and Theodosius (381) issued bloody edicts against them, yet we find them still aggressive in the time of Augustin.&#160; From Africa Manich&aelig;ism spread into Spain, Gaul and Aquitaine.&#160; Leo the Great and Valentinian III. took measures against them in Italy (440 sq.).&#160; They appear, however, to have continued their work, for Gregory the Great mentions them (590 sq.).&#160; From this time onwards their influence is to be traced in such parties as the Euchites, Enthusiasts, Bogomiles, Catharists, Beghards, etc.&#160; But it is not safe to attach too much importance to the mere fact that these parties were stigmatized as Manich&aelig;ans by their enemies.&#160; Even in the Reformation time and since, individuals and small parties have appeared which in some features strongly resembled the ancient Manich&aelig;ans.&#160; Manich&aelig;ism was a product of the East, and in the East it met with most acceptance.&#160; To the spirit of the West it was altogether foreign, and only in a greatly modified form could it ever have flourished there.&#160; It might persist for centuries as a secret society, but it could not endure the light.</p>
