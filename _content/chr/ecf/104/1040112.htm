<p class="c38"><a name="iv.viii.xi-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="iv.viii.xi-p1.1"></A>Chapter 10.&#8212;The Holy Spirit Twice Given.</span></p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.viii.xi-p2"></A>11.&#160; For the glorification of our Lord among men is His resurrection from the dead and His ascension to heaven.&#160; For it is written in the Gospel according to John:&#160; "The Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">275</FONT></A>
&#160; Now if the reason why He was not given was that Jesus was not yet glorified, He was given immediately on the glorification of Jesus.&#160; And since that glorification was twofold, as regards man and as regards God, twice also was the Holy Spirit given:&#160; once, when, after His resurrection from the dead, He breathed on the face of His disciples, saying, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">276</FONT></A>
 and again, ten days after His ascension to heaven.&#160; This number ten signifies perfection; for to the number seven which embraces all created things, is added the trinity of the Creator.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">277</FONT></A>
&#160; On these things there is much pious and sober discourse among spiritual men.&#160; But I must keep to my point; for my business at present is not to teach you, which you might think presumptuous, but to take the part of an inquirer, and learn from you, as I tried to do for nine years without success.&#160; Now, therefore, I have a document to believe on the subject of the Holy Spirit&#146;s advent; and if you bid me not to believe this document, as your usual advice is not to believe ignorantly, without consideration,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_277"></A><A HREF="#fn_277"><FONT SIZE="1">278</FONT></A>
 much less will I believe your documents.&#160; Away, then, with all books, and disclose the truth with logical clearness, so as to leave no doubt in my mind; or bring forward books where I shall find not an imperious demand for my belief, but a trustworthy statement of what I may learn.&#160; Perhaps you say this epistle is also of this character.&#160; Let me, then, no longer stop at the threshold:&#160; let us see the contents.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.viii.xi-p6"></A> [The Manich&aelig;ans assumed the role of rationalists, and scorned the credulity of ordinary believers.&#160; Yet they required in their followers an amount of credulity which only persons of a peculiar turn of mind could furnish.&#160; The same thing applies to modern rationalistic anti-Christian systems.&#160; The fact is, that it requires infinitely less credulity to believe in historical Christianity than to disbelieve in it.&#8212;A.H.N.]</p>
