<span id="iv.iv.ii-p4"></span>*It is laid down at the outset that the
customs of the holy life of the Church should be referred to the chief
good of man, that is, God.  We must seek after God with supreme
affection; and this doctrine is supported in the Catholic Church by the
authority of both Testaments.  The four virtues get their names from
different forms of this love.  Then follow the duties of love to our
neighbor.  In the Catholic Church we find examples of continence and of
true Christian conduct.*

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p2"></span> Written in the year 388.  In his
*Retractations* (i. 7) Augustin says:  "When I was at Rome after my
baptism, and could not bear in silence the vaunting of the Manichæans
about their pretended and misleading continence or abstinence, in which,
to deceive the inexperienced, they claim superiority over true
Christians, to whom they are not to be compared, I wrote two books, one
on the morals of the Catholic Church, the other on the morals of the
Manichæans."
