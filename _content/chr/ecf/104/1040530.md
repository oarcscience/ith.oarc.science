<span id="v.v.iv.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 43.—</span>101.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xliii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"Can it be that the traitor Judas hung himself for you, or did he imbue
you with his character, that, following his deeds, you should seize on
the treasures of the Church, and sell for money to the powers of this
world us who are the heirs of Christ?"

<span id="v.v.iv.xliii-p2"></span>102.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xliii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  Judas did not
die for us, but Christ, to whom the Church dispersed throughout the
world says, "So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth
me:  for I trust in Thy word." <span
id="fr_2116"></span>[2117](#fn_2116)   When, therefore, I hear the words
of the Lord, saying, "Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem,
and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and even in the whole earth," <span
id="fr_2117"></span>[2118](#fn_2117) and through the voice of His
prophet, "Their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words
into the ends of the world," <span id="fr_2118"></span>[2119](#fn_2118)
no bodily admixture of evil ever is able to disturb me, if I know how to
say, "Be surety for Thy servant for good:  let not the proud oppress
me." <span id="fr_2119"></span>[2120](#fn_2119)   I do not, therefore,
concern myself about a vain calumniation when I have a substantial
promise.  But if you complain about matters or places appertaining to
the Church, which you used once to hold, and hold no longer, then the
Jews also may say that they are righteous, and reproach us with
unrighteousness, because the Christians now occupy the place in which of
old they impiously reigned.  What then is there unfitting, if, according
to a similar will of the Lord, the Catholics now hold the things which
formerly the heretics used to have?  For against all such men as this,
that is to say, against all impious and unrighteous men, those words of
the Lord have force, "The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and be
given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof;" <span
id="fr_2120"></span>[2121](#fn_2120) or is it written in vain, "The
righteous shall eat of the labors of the impious"? <span
id="fr_2121"></span>[2122](#fn_2121)   Wherefore you ought rather to be
amazed that you still possess something, than that there is something
which you have lost.  But neither need you wonder even at this, for it
is by degrees that the whitened wall falls down.  Yet look back at the
followers of Maximianus, see what places they possessed, and by whose
agency and under whose attacks they were driven from them, and do you
venture, if you can, to say that to suffer things like these is
righteousness, while to do them is unrighteousness.  In the first place,
because you did the deed, and they suffered them; and secondly, because,
according to the rule of this righteousness, you are found to be
inferior.  For they were driven from the ancient palaces by Catholic
emperors acting through judges, while you are not even driven forth by
the mandates of the emperors themselves from the basilicas of unity. 
For what reason is this, save that you are of less merit, not only than
the rest of your colleagues, but even than those very men whom you
assuredly condemned as guilty of sacrilege by the mouth of your plenary
Council?
