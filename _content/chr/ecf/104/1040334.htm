<p class="c41"><a name="v.iv.vii.ix-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.vii.ix-p1.1"></A>Chapter 9.&#8212;</span>10.&#160; Now we must see what is said of the baptism of John.&#160; For "we read in the Acts of the Apostles, that those who had already been baptized with the baptism of John were yet baptized by Paul,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1479"></A><A HREF="#fn_1479"><FONT SIZE="1">1480</FONT></A>
 simply because the baptism of John was not the baptism of Christ, but a baptism allowed by Christ to John, so as to be called especially John&#146;s baptism; as the same John says, "A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1480"></A><A HREF="#fn_1480"><FONT SIZE="1">1481</FONT></A>
&#160; And that he might not possibly seem to receive this from God the Father in such wise as not to receive it from the Son, speaking presently of Christ Himself, he says, "Of His fullness have all we received."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1481"></A><A HREF="#fn_1481"><FONT SIZE="1">1482</FONT></A>
&#160; But by the grace of a certain dispensation John received this, which was to last not for long, but only long enough to prepare for the Lord the way in which he must needs be the forerunner.&#160; And as our Lord was presently to enter on this way with all humility, and to lead those who humbly followed Him to perfection, as He washed the feet of His servants,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1482"></A><A HREF="#fn_1482"><FONT SIZE="1">1483</FONT></A>
 so was He willing to be baptized with the baptism of a servant.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1483"></A><A HREF="#fn_1483"><FONT SIZE="1">1484</FONT></A>
&#160; For as He set Himself to minister to the feet of those whose guide He was Himself, so He submitted Himself to the gift of John which He Himself had given, that all might understand what sacrilegious arrogance they would show in despising the baptism which they ought each of them to receive from the Lord, when the Lord Himself accepted what He Himself had bestowed upon a servant, that he might give it as his own; and that when John, than whom no greater had arisen among   them that are born of women,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1484"></A><A HREF="#fn_1484"><FONT SIZE="1">1485</FONT></A>
 bore such testimony to Christ, as to confess that he was not worthy to unloose the latchet of His shoe,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1485"></A><A HREF="#fn_1485"><FONT SIZE="1">1486</FONT></A>
 Christ might both, by receiving his baptism, be found to be the humblest among men, and, by taking away the place for the baptism of John, be believed to be the most high God, at once the teacher of humility and the giver of exaltation.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.vii.ix-p9"></A>11.&#160; For to none of the prophets, to no one at all in holy Scripture, do we read that it was granted to baptize in the water of repentance for the remission of sins, as it was granted to John; that, causing the hearts of the people to hang upon him through this marvellous grace, he might prepare in them the way for Him whom he declared to be so infinitely greater than himself.&#160; But the Lord Jesus Christ cleanses His Church by such a baptism that on receiving it   no other is required; while John gave a first washing with such a baptism that on receiving it there was further need of the baptism of the Lord,&#8212;not that the first baptism should be repeated, but that the baptism of Christ, for whom he was preparing the way, might be further bestowed on those who had received the baptism of John.&#160; For if Christ&#146;s humility were not to be commended to our notice, neither would there be any need of the baptism of John; again, if the end were in John, after his   baptism there would be no need of the baptism of Christ.&#160; But because "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1486"></A><A HREF="#fn_1486"><FONT SIZE="1">1487</FONT></A>
 it was shown by John to whom men should go, and in whom, when they had reached Him, they should rest.&#160; The same, John, therefore, set forth both the exalted nature of the Lord, when he placed Him far before himself, and His humility, when he baptized Him as the lowest of the people.&#160; But if John had baptized Christ alone, he would be thought to have been the dispenser of a better baptism, in that with which Christ alone was baptized, than the baptism of Christ with which   Christians are baptized; and again, if all ought to be baptized first with the baptism of John, and then with that of Christ, the baptism of Christ would deservedly seem to be lacking in fullness and perfection, as not sufficing for salvation.&#160; Wherefore the Lord was baptized with the baptism of John, that He might bend the proud necks of men to His own health-giving baptism; and He was not alone baptized with it, lest He should <A NAME="page_468"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 468</FONT></A> <a name="v.iv.vii.ix-Page_468"></A>show His own to be inferior to this, with   which none but He Himself had deserved to be baptized; and He did not allow it to continue longer, lest the one baptism with which He baptizes might seem to need the other to precede it.</p>
