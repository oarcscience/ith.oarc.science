<p class="c41"><a name="v.vi.iv-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.vi.iv-p1.1"></A>Chapter 2.&#8212;</span>6.&#160; I would add, moreover, that they themselves, by making it the subject of an accusation, referred the case of C&aelig;cilianus to the decision of the Emperor Constantine; and that, even after the bishops had pronounced their judgment,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2479"></A><A HREF="#fn_2479"><FONT SIZE="1">2480</FONT></A>
 finding that they could not crush C&aelig;cilianus, they brought him in person before the above-named emperor for trial, in the most determined spirit of persecution.&#160; And so they were themselves the first to do what they censure in us, in order that they may deceive the unlearned, saying that Christians ought not to demand any assistance from Christian emperors against the enemies of Christ.&#160; And this, too, they did not dare to deny in the conference which we held at the same time in Carthage:&#160; nay, they even venture to make it a matter of boasting that their fathers had laid a criminal indictment against C&aelig;cilianus before the emperor; adding furthermore a lie, to the effect that they had there worsted him, and procured his condemnation.&#160; How then can they be otherwise than persecutors, seeing that when they persecuted C&aelig;cilianus by their accusations, and were overcome by him, they sought to claim false glory for themselves by a most shameless life; not only considering it no reproach, but glorying in it as conducive to their praise, if they could prove that C&aelig;cilianus had been condemned on the accusation of their fathers?&#160; But in regard to the manner in which they were overcome at every turn in the conference itself, seeing that the records are exceedingly voluminous, and it would be a serious matter to have them read to you while you are occupied in other matters that are essential to the peace of Rome, perhaps it may be possible to have a digest &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2480"></A><A HREF="#fn_2480"><FONT SIZE="1">2481</FONT></A>
 of them read to you, which I believe to be in the possession of my brother and fellow-bishop Optatus; or if he has not a copy, he might easily procure one from the church at Sitifa; for I can well believe that even that volume will prove wearisome enough to you from its lengthiness, amid the burden of your many cares.</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.iv-p4"></A>7.&#160; For the Donatists met with the same fate as the accusers of the holy Daniel.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2481"></A><A HREF="#fn_2481"><FONT SIZE="1">2482</FONT></A>
&#160; For as the lions were turned against them, so the laws by which they had proposed to crush an innocent victim were turned against the Donatists; save that, through the mercy of Christ, the laws which seemed to be opposed to them are in reality their truest friends; for through their operation many of them have been, and are daily being reformed, and return God thanks that they are reformed, and delivered from their ruinous madness.&#160; And those who used to hate are now filled with love; and now that they have recovered their right minds, they congratulate themselves that these most wholesome laws were brought to bear against them, with as much fervency as in their madness they detested them; and are filled with the same spirit of ardent love towards those who yet remain as ourselves, desiring that we should strive in like manner that those with whom they had been like to perish might be saved.&#160; For both the physician is irksome to the raging madman, and a father to his undisciplined son,&#8212;the former because of the restraint, the latter because of the chastisement which he inflicts; yet both are acting in love.&#160; But if they were to neglect their charge, and allow them to perish, this mistaken kindness would more truly be accounted cruelty.&#160; For if the horse and mule, which have no understanding, resist with all the force of bites and kicks the efforts of the men who treat their wounds in order to cure them; and yet the men, though they are often exposed to danger from their teeth and heels, and sometimes meet with actual hurt, nevertheless do not desert them till they restore them to health through the pain and annoyance which the healing process gives,&#8212;how much more should man refuse to desert his fellow-man, or brother to desert his brother, lest he should perish everlastingly, being himself now able to comprehend the vastness of the boon accorded to himself in his reformation, at the very time that he complained of suffering persecution?</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.iv-p6"></A>8.&#160; As then the apostle says, "As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all <A NAME="page_636"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 636</FONT></A> <a name="v.vi.iv-Page_636"></A>men, not being weary in well-doing,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2482"></A><A HREF="#fn_2482"><FONT SIZE="1">2483</FONT></A>
 so let all be called to salvation, let all be recalled from the path of destruction,&#8212;those who may, by the sermons of Catholic preachers; those who may, by the edicts of Catholic princes; some through those who obey the warnings of God, some through those who obey the emperor&#146;s commands.&#160; For, moreover, when emperors enact bad laws on the side of falsehood, as against the truth, those who hold a right faith are approved, and, if they persevere, are crowned; but when the emperors enact good laws on behalf of the truth against falsehood, then those who rage against them are put in fear, and those who understand are reformed.&#160; Whosoever, therefore, refuses to obey the laws of the emperors which are enacted against the truth of God, wins for himself a great reward; but whosoever refuses to obey the laws of the emperors which are enacted in behalf of truth, wins for himself great condemnation.&#160; For in the times, too, of the prophets, the kings who, in dealing with the people of God, did not prohibit nor annul the ordinances which were issued contrary to God&#146;s commands, are all of them censured; and those who did prohibit and annul them are praised as deserving more than other men.&#160; And king Nebuchadnezzar, when he was a servant of idols, enacted an impious law that a certain idol should be worshipped; but those who refused to obey his impious command acted piously and faithfully.&#160; And the very same king, when converted by a miracle from God, enacted a pious and praiseworthy law on behalf of the truth, that every one who should speak anything amiss against the true God, the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, should perish utterly, with all his house.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2483"></A><A HREF="#fn_2483"><FONT SIZE="1">2484</FONT></A>
&#160; If any persons disobeyed this law, and justly suffered the penalty imposed, they might have said what these men say, that they were righteous because they suffered persecution through the law enacted by the king:&#160; and this they certainly would have said, had they been as mad as these who make divisions between the members of Christ, and spurn the sacraments of Christ, and take credit for being persecuted, because they are prevented from doing such things by the laws which the emperors have passed to preserve the unity of Christ and boast falsely of their innocence, and seek from men the glory of martyrdom, which they cannot receive from our Lord.</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.iv-p9"></A>9.&#160; But true martyrs are such as those of whom the Lord says, "Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness&#146; sake."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2484"></A><A HREF="#fn_2484"><FONT SIZE="1">2485</FONT></A>
&#160; It is not, therefore, those who suffer persecution for their unrighteousness, and for the divisions which they impiously introduce into Christian unity, but those who suffer for righteousness&#146; sake, that are truly martyrs.&#160; For Hagar also suffered persecution at the hands of Sarah;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2485"></A><A HREF="#fn_2485"><FONT SIZE="1">2486</FONT></A>
 and in that case she who persecuted was righteous, and she unrighteous who suffered persecution.&#160; Are we to compare with this persecution which Hagar suffered the case of holy David, who was persecuted by unrighteous Saul?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2486"></A><A HREF="#fn_2486"><FONT SIZE="1">2487</FONT></A>
&#160; Surely there is in essential difference, not in respect of his suffering, but because he suffered for righteousness&#146; sake.&#160; And the Lord Himself was crucified with two thieves;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2487"></A><A HREF="#fn_2487"><FONT SIZE="1">2488</FONT></A>
 but those who were joined in their suffering were separated by the difference of its cause.&#160; Accordingly, in the psalm, we must interpret of the true martyrs, who wish to be distinguished from false martyrs, the verse in which it is said, "Judge me, O Lord, and distinguish&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2488"></A><A HREF="#fn_2488"><FONT SIZE="1">2489</FONT></A>
 my cause from an ungodly nation."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2489"></A><A HREF="#fn_2489"><FONT SIZE="1">2490</FONT></A>
&#160; He does not say, Distinguish my punishment, but "Distinguish my cause."&#160; For the punishment of the impious may be the same; but the cause of the martyrs is always different.&#160; To whose mouth also the words are suitable, "They persecute me wrongfully; help Thou me;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2490"></A><A HREF="#fn_2490"><FONT SIZE="1">2491</FONT></A>
 in which the Psalmist claimed to have a right to be helped in righteousness, because his adversaries persecuted him wrongfully; for if they had been right in persecuting him, he would have deserved not help, but correction.</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.iv-p17"></A>10.&#160; But if they think that no one can be justified in using violence,&#8212;as they said in the course of the conference that the true Church must necessarily be the one which suffers persecution, not the one inflicting it,&#8212;in that case I no longer urge what I observed above; because, if the matter stand as they maintain that it does, then C&aelig;cilianus must have belonged to the true Church, seeing that their fathers persecuted him, by pressing his accusation even to the tribunal of the emperor himself.&#160; For we maintain that he belonged to the true Church, not merely because he suffered persecution, but because he suffered it for righteousness&#146; sake; but that they were alienated from the Church, not merely because they persecuted, but because they did so in unrighteousness.&#160; This, then, is our position.&#160; But if they make no inquiry into the causes for which each person inflicts persecution, or for which he suffers it, but think that it is a sufficient sign of a true Christian that he does not <A NAME="page_637"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 637</FONT></A> <a name="v.vi.iv-Page_637"></A>inflict persecution, but suffers it, then beyond all question they include C&aelig;cilianus in that definition, who did not inflict, but suffered persecution; and they equally exclude their own fathers from the definition, for they inflicted, but did not suffer it.</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="v.vi.iv-p18"></A>11.&#160; But this, I say, I forbear to urge.&#160; Yet one point I must press:&#160; If the true Church is the one which actually suffers persecution, not the one which inflicts it, let them ask the apostle of what Church Sarah was a type, when she inflicted persecution on her hand-maid.&#160; For he declares that the free mother of us all, the heavenly Jerusalem, that is to say, the true Church of God, was prefigured in that woman who cruelly entreated her hand-maid. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2491"></A><A HREF="#fn_2491"><FONT SIZE="1">2492</FONT></A>
&#160; But if we investigate the story further, we shall find that the handmaid rather persecuted Sarah by her haughtiness, than Sarah the handmaid by her severity:&#160; for the handmaid was doing wrong to her mistress; the mistress only imposed on her a proper discipline in her haughtiness.&#160; Again I ask, if good and holy men never inflict persecution upon any one, but only suffer it, whose words they think that those are in the psalm where we read, "I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them; neither did I turn again till they were consumed?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2492"></A><A HREF="#fn_2492"><FONT SIZE="1">2493</FONT></A>
&#160; If, therefore, we wish either to declare or to recognize the truth, there is a persecution of unrighteousness, which the impious inflict upon the Church of Christ; and there is a righteous persecution, which the Church of Christ inflicts upon the impious.&#160; She therefore is blessed in suffering persecution for righteousness&#146; sake; but they are miserable, suffering persecution for unrighteousness.&#160; Moreover, she persecutes in the spirit of love, they in the spirit of wrath; she that she may correct, they that they may overthrow:&#160; she that she may recall from error, they that they may drive headlong into error.&#160; Finally, she persecutes her enemies and arrests them, until they become weary in their vain opinions, so that they should make advance in the truth; but they, returning evil for good, because we take measures for their good, to secure their eternal salvation, endeavor even to strip us of our temporal safety, being so in love with murder, that they commit it on their own persons, when they cannot find victims in any others.&#160; For in proportion as the Christian charity of the Church endeavors to deliver them from that destruction, so that none of them should die, so their madness endeavors either to slay us, that they may feed the lust of their own cruelty, or even to kill themselves, that they may not seem to have lost the power of putting men to death.</p>
