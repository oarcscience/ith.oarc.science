<span id="v.iv.ix.li"></span>

<span id="v.iv.ix.li-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter 51.—</span>99.  Taking all these
things, therefore, into consideration, I think that I am not rash in
saying that there are some in the house of God after such a fashion as
not to be themselves the very house of God, which is said to be built
upon a rock, <span id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899) which is called
the one dove, <span id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900) which is styled
the beauteous bride without spot or wrinkle, <span
id="fr_1901"></span>[1902](#fn_1901) and a garden enclosed, a fountain
sealed, a well of living water, an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant
fruits; <span id="fr_1902"></span>[1903](#fn_1902) which house also
received the keys, and the power of binding and loosing. <span
id="fr_1903"></span>[1904](#fn_1903)   If any one shall neglect this
<span id="page_512">p. 512</span> <span
id="v.iv.ix.li-Page_512"></span>house when it arrests and corrects him,
the Lord says, "Let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a
publican." <span id="fr_1904"></span>[1905](#fn_1904)   Of this house it
is said, "Lord, I have loved the habitation of Thy house, and the place
where Thine honor dwelleth;" <span id="fr_1905"></span>[1906](#fn_1905)
and, "He maketh men to be of one mind in an house;" <span
id="fr_1906"></span>[1907](#fn_1906) and, "I was glad when they said
unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord;" <span
id="fr_1907"></span>[1908](#fn_1907) and, "Blessed are they that dwell
in Thy house, O Lord; they will be still praising Thee;" <span
id="fr_1908"></span>[1909](#fn_1908) with countless other passages to
the same effect.  This house is also called wheat, bringing forth fruit
with patience, some thirty-fold, some sixtyfold, and some an
hundredfold. <span id="fr_1909"></span>[1910](#fn_1909)   This house is
also in vessels of gold and of silver, <span
id="fr_1910"></span>[1911](#fn_1910) and in precious stones and
imperishable woods.  To this house it is said, "Forbearing one another
in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
peace;" <span id="fr_1911"></span>[1912](#fn_1911) and, "For the temple
of God is holy, which temple ye are." <span
id="fr_1912"></span>[1913](#fn_1912)   For this house is composed of
those that are good and faithful, and of the holy servants of God
dispersed throughout the world, and bound together by the unity of the
Spirit, whether they know each other personally or not.  But we hold
that others are said to be in the house after such a sort, that they
belong not to the substance of the house, nor to the society of fruitful
and peaceful justice, but only as the chaff is said to be among the
corn; for that they are in the house we cannot deny, when the apostle
says, "But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of
silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to
dishonor." <span id="fr_1913"></span>[1914](#fn_1913)   Of this
countless multitude are found to be not only the crowd which within the
Church afflicts the hearts of the saints, who are so few in comparison
with so vast a host, but also the heresies and schisms which exist in
those who have burst the meshes of the net, and may now be said to be
rather out of the house than in the house, of whom it is said, "They
went out from us, but they were not of us." <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[1915](#fn_1914)   For they are more thoroughly
separated, now that they are also divided from us in the body, than are
those who live within the Church in a carnal and worldly fashion, and
are separated from us in the spirit.

he thinks the meaning of this last passage to be, not as Cyprian took
it, *Ep*. liv. 3, that the vessels of gold and silver are the good,
which are to honor; the vessels of wood and earth the wicked, which are
to dishonor:  but that the material of the vessels refers to the outward
appearance of the several members of the Church, and that in each class
some will be found to honor, and some to dishonor.  This interpretation
he derives from Tychonius.
