<p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.xli-p2"></A>But fire is eternal, not as God is eternal, because, though without end, yet is not without beginning; but God is also without beginning.&#160; Then, although it may be employed perpetually for the punishment of sinners, yet it is mutable nature.&#160; But that is true eternity which is true immortality, that is that highest immutability, which cannot be changed at all.&#160; For it is one thing not to suffer change, when change is possible, and another thing to be absolutely incapable of change.&#160; Therefore, just as man is called good, yet not as God, of whom it was said, "There is none good save God alone;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1130"></A><A HREF="#fn_1130"><FONT SIZE="1">1131</FONT></A>
 and just as the soul is called immortal, yet not as God, of whom it was said, "Who alone hath immortality;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1131"></A><A HREF="#fn_1131"><FONT SIZE="1">1132</FONT></A>
 and just as a man is called wise, yet not as God, of whom it was said, "To God the only wise;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1132"></A><A HREF="#fn_1132"><FONT SIZE="1">1133</FONT></A>
 so fire is called eternal, yet not as God, whose alone is immortality itself and true eternity.</p>
