<p class="c10"><a name="iv.viii.x-p2"></A>10.&#160; Perhaps you will say to me, When, then, did the Paraclete promised by the Lord come?&#160; As regards this, had I nothing else to believe on the subject, I should rather look for the Paraclete as still to come, than allow that He came in Manich&aelig;us.&#160; But seeing that the advent of the Holy Spirit is narrated with perfect clearness in the Acts of the Apostles, where is the necessity of my so gratuitously running the risk of believing heretics?&#160; For in the Acts it is written as follows:&#160; "The former treatise have we made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, in the day in which He chose the apostles by the Holy Spirit, and commanded them to preach the gospel.&#160; By those to whom He showed Himself alive after His passion by many proofs in the daytime, He was seen forty days, teaching concerning the kingdom of God.&#160; And how He conversed with them, and commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith He, ye have heard of me.&#160; For John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall begin to be baptized with the Holy Spirit, whom also ye shall receive after not many days, that is, at Pentecost.&#160; When they had come, they asked him, saying, Lord, wilt Thou at this time manifest Thyself?&#160; And when will be the kingdom of Israel?&#160; And He said unto them, No one can know the time which the Father hath put in His own power.&#160; But ye shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Jud&aelig;a, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_272"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">273</FONT></A>
&#160; Behold you have here the Lord reminding His disciples of the promise of the Father, which they had heard from His mouth, of the coming of the Holy Spirit.&#160; Let us now see when He was sent; for shortly after we read as follows:&#160; "And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.&#160; And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.&#160; And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.&#160; And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.&#160; And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.&#160; And when the sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because every man heard them speak in his own language.&#160; And they were all amazed, and marvelled, saying one to another, Are not all these which speak Galil&aelig;ans? and how heard we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?&#160; Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Armenia, and in Cappadocia, in Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the regions of Africa about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews, natives, Cretes, and Arabians, they heard them speak in their own tongues the wonderful works of God.&#160; And they were all amazed, and were in doubt on account of what had happened, saying, What meaneth this?&#160; But others, mocking, said, These men are full of new wine."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_273"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">274</FONT></A>
&#160; You see when the Holy Spirit came.&#160; What more do you wish?&#160; If the Scriptures are credible, should not I believe most readily in these Acts, which have the strongest testimony in their support, and which have had the advantage of becoming generally known, and of being handed down and of being publicly taught along with the gospel itself, which contains the promise of the Holy Spirit, which also we believe?&#160; On <A NAME="page_134"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 134</FONT></A> <a name="iv.viii.x-Page_134"></A>reading, then, these Acts of the Apostles, which stand, as regards authority, on a level with the gospel, I find that not only was the Holy Spirit promised to these true apostles, but that He was also sent so manifestly, that no room was left for errors on this subject.</p>
