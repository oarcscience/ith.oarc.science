<span id="v.v.iii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter</span> 21.—23.  Lastly, it has been
said, as he himself has also quoted, "Ye shall know them by their
fruits:" <span id="fr_1955"></span>[1956](#fn_1955)   let us therefore
examine into their fruits.  You bring up against our predecessors their
delivery of the sacred books.  This very charge we urge with greater
probability against their accusers themselves.  And not to carry our
search too far, in the same city of Constantina your predecessors
ordained Silvanus bishop at the very outset of his schism.  He, while he
was still a subdeacon, was most unmistakeably entered as a *traditor* in
the archives of the city.  <span id="fr_1956"></span>[1957](#fn_1956)  
If you on your side bring forward documents against our predecessors,
all that we ask is equal terms, that we should either believe both to be
true or both to be false.  If both are true, you are unquestionably
guilty of schism, who have pretended that you avoid offenses in the
communion of the whole world, which you had commonly among you in the
small fragment of your own sect.  But again, if both are false, you are
unquestionably guilty of schism, who, on account of the false charges of
giving up the sacred books, are staining yourselves with the heinous
offence of severance from the Church.  But if we have something to urge
in accusation while you have nothing, or if our charges are true whilst
yours are false, it is no longer matter of discussion how thoroughly
your mouths are closed.
