<span id="v.vi.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.vi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—</span>19.  But as to the argument
of those men who are unwilling that their impious deeds should be
checked by the enactment of righteous laws, when they say that the
apostles never sought such measures from the kings of the earth, they do
not consider the different character of that age, and that everything
comes in its own season.  For what emperor had as yet believed in
Christ, so as to serve Him in the cause of piety by enacting laws
against impiety, when as yet the declaration of the prophet was only in
the course of its fulfillment, "Why do the heathen rage, and the people
imagine a vain thing?  The kings of the earth set themselves, and their
rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against His
Anointed;" and there was as yet no sign of that which is spoken a little
later in the same psalm:  "Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings; be
instructed, ye judges of the earth.  Serve the Lord with fear, and
rejoice with trembling." <span id="fr_2497"></span>[2498](#fn_2497)  
How then are kings to serve the Lord with fear, except by preventing and
chastising with religious severity all those acts which are done in
opposition to the commandments of the Lord?  For a man serves God in one
way in that he is man, in another way in that he is also king.  In that
he is man, he serves Him by living faithfully; but in that he is also
king, he serves Him by enforcing with suitable rigor such laws as ordain
what is righteous, and punish what is the reverse.  Even as Hezekiah
served Him, by destroying the groves and the temples of the idols, and
the high places which had been built in violation of the commandments of
God; <span id="fr_2498"></span>[2499](#fn_2498) or even as Josiah served
Him, by doing the same things in his turn; <span
id="fr_2499"></span>[2500](#fn_2499) or as the king of the Ninevites
served Him, by compelling all the men of his city to make satisfaction
to the Lord; <span id="fr_2500"></span>[2501](#fn_2500) or as Darius
served Him, by giving the idol into the power of Daniel to be broken,
and by casting his enemies into the den of lions; <span
id="fr_2501"></span>[2502](#fn_2501) or as Nebuchadnezzar served Him, of
whom I have spoken before, by issuing a terrible law to prevent any of
his subjects from blaspheming God. <span
id="fr_2502"></span>[2503](#fn_2502)   In this way, therefore, kings can
serve the Lord, even in so far as they are kings, when they do in His
service what they could not do were they not kings.

<span id="v.vi.vii-p8"></span>20.  Seeing, then, that the kings of the
earth were not yet serving the Lord in the time of the apostles, but
were still imagining vain things against the Lord and against His
Anointed, that all might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets,
it must be granted that at that time acts of impiety could not possibly
be prevented by the laws, but were rather performed under their
sanction.  For the order of events was then so rolling on, that even the
Jews were killing those who preached Christ, thinking that they did God
service in so doing, just as Christ had foretold, <span
id="fr_2503"></span>[2504](#fn_2503) and the heathen were raging against
the Christians, and the patience of the martyrs was overcoming them
all.  But so soon as the fulfillment began of what is written in a later
psalm, "All kings shall fall down before Him; all nations shall serve
Him," <span id="fr_2504"></span>[2505](#fn_2504) what sober-minded man
could say to the kings, "Let not any thought trouble you within your
kingdom as to who restrains or attacks the Church of your Lord; deem it
not a matter in which you should be concerned, which of your subjects
may choose to be religious or sacrilegious," seeing that you cannot say
to them, "Deem it no concern of yours which of your subjects may choose
<span id="page_641">p. 641</span> <span id="v.vi.vii-Page_641"></span>to
be chaste, or which unchaste?"  For why, when free-will is given by God
to man, should adulteries be punished by the laws, and sacrilege
allowed?  Is it a lighter matter that a soul should not keep faith with
God, than that a woman should be faithless to her husband?  Or if those
faults which are committed not in contempt but in ignorance of religious
truth are to be visited with lighter punishment, are they therefore to
be neglected altogether?
