<p class="c41"><a name="v.iv.iv.vi-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.iv.vi-p1.1"></A>Chapter 6.&#8212;</span>7.&#160; What then, ye Donatists, what have ye to say to this?&#160; If our opinion about baptism is true, yet all who thought differently in the time of Cyprian were not cut off from the unity of the Church, till God revealed to them the truth of the point on which they were in error, why then have ye by your sacrilegious separation broken the bond of peace?&#160; But if yours is the true opinion about baptism, Cyprian and the others, in   conjunction with whom ye set forth that he held such a Council, remained in unity with those who thought otherwise; why, therefore, have ye broken the bond of peace?&#160; Choose which alternative ye will, ye are compelled to pronounce an opinion against your schism.&#160; Answer me, wherefore have ye separated yourselves?&#160; Wherefore have ye erected an altar in opposition to the whole world?&#160; Wherefore do ye not communicate with the Churches to which apostolic epistles have been sent, which you   yourselves read and acknowledge, in accordance with whose tenor you say that you order your lives?&#160; Answer me, wherefore have ye separated yourselves?&#160; I suppose in order that ye might not perish by communion with wicked men.&#160; How then was it that Cyprian, and so many of his colleagues, did not perish?&#160; For though they believed that heretics and schismatics did not possess baptism, yet they chose rather to hold communion with them when they had been received into the Church without baptism,   although they believed that their flagrant and sacrilegious sins were yet upon their heads, than to be separated from the unity of the Church, according to the words of Cyprian, "Judging no one, nor depriving any one of the right of communion if he differ from us."</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.iv.vi-p2"></A>8.&#160; If, therefore, by such communion with the wicked the just cannot but perish, the Church had already perished in the time of Cyprian.&#160; Whence then sprang the origin of Donatus? where was he taught, where was he baptized, where was he ordained, since the Church had been already destroyed by the contagion of communion with the wicked?&#160; But if the Church still existed, the wicked could do no harm to the good in one com<A NAME="page_429"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 429</FONT></A> <a name="v.iv.iv.vi-Page_429"></A>munion with them.&#160; Wherefore   did ye separate yourselves?&#160; Behold, I see in unity Cyprian and others, his colleagues, who, on holding a council, decided that those who have been baptized without the communion of the Church have no true baptism, and that therefore it must be given them when they join the Church.&#160; But again, behold I see in the same unity that certain men think differently in this matter, and that, recognizing in those who come from heretics and schismatics the baptism of Christ, they do not venture to   baptize them afresh.&#160; All of these catholic unity embraces in her motherly breast, bearing each other&#146;s burdens by turns, and endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1227"></A><A HREF="#fn_1227"><FONT SIZE="1">1228</FONT></A>
 till God should reveal to one or other of them any error in their views.&#160; If the one party held the truth, were they infected by the others, or no?&#160; If the others held the truth, were they infected by the first, or no?&#160; Choose which ye will.&#160; If there was contamination, the Church even then ceased to exist; answer me, therefore, whence came ye forth hither?&#160; But if the Church remained, the good are in no wise contaminated by the bad in such communion; answer me, therefore,   why did ye break the bond?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.iv.vi-p4"></A>9.&#160; Or is it perhaps that schismatics, when received without baptism, bring no infection, but that it is brought by those who deliver up the sacred books?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1228"></A><A HREF="#fn_1228"><FONT SIZE="1">1229</FONT></A>
&#160; For that there were traditors of your number is proved by the clearest testimony of history.&#160; And if you had then brought true evidence against those whom you were accusing, you would have proved your cause before the unity of the whole world, so that you would have been retained whilst they were shut out.&#160; And if you endeavored to do this, and did not succeed, the world is not to blame, which trusted the judges of the Church rather than the beaten parties in the suit;   whilst, if you would not urge your suit, the world again is not to blame, which could not condemn men without their cause being heard.&#160; Why, then, did you separate yourselves from the innocent?&#160; You cannot defend the sacrilege of your schism.&#160; But this I pass over.&#160; But so much I say, that if the traditors could have defiled you, who were not convicted by you, and by whom, on the contrary, you were beaten, much more could the sacrilege of schismatics and heretics, received into the Church, as   you maintain, without baptism, have defiled Cyprian.&#160; Yet he did not separate himself.&#160; And inasmuch as the Church continued to exist, it is clear that it could not be defiled.&#160; Wherefore, then, did you separate yourselves, I do not say from the innocent, as the facts proved them, but from the traditors, as they were never proved to be?&#160; Are the sins of traditors, as I began to say, heavier than those of schismatics?&#160; Let us not bring in deceitful balances, to which we may hang what weights we   will and how we will, saying to suit ourselves, "This is heavy and this is light;" but let us bring forward the sacred balance out of holy Scripture, as out of the Lord&#146;s treasure-house, and let us weigh them by it, to see which is the heavier; or rather, let us not weigh them for ourselves, but read the weights as declared by the Lord.&#160; At the time when the Lord showed, by the example of recent punishment, that there was need to guard against the sins of olden days, and an idol was made and   worshipped, and the prophetic book was burned by the wrath of a scoffing king, and schism was attempted, the idolatry was punished with the sword,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1229"></A><A HREF="#fn_1229"><FONT SIZE="1">1230</FONT></A>
 the burning of the book by slaughter in war and captivity in a foreign land,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1230"></A><A HREF="#fn_1230"><FONT SIZE="1">1231</FONT></A>
 schism by the earth opening, and swallowing up alive the leaders of the schism while the rest were consumed with fire from heaven.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1231"></A><A HREF="#fn_1231"><FONT SIZE="1">1232</FONT></A>
&#160; Who will now doubt that that was the worse crime which received the heavier punishment?&#160; If men coming from such sacrilegious company, without baptism, as you maintain, could not defile Cyprian, how could those defile you who were not convicted but supposed betrayers of the sacred books?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1232"></A><A HREF="#fn_1232"><FONT SIZE="1">1233</FONT></A>
&#160; For if they had not only given up the books to be burned, but had actually burned them with their own hands, they would have been guilty of a less sin than if they had committed schism; for schism is visited with the heavier, the other with the lighter punishment, not at man&#146;s discretion, but by the judgment of God.</p>
