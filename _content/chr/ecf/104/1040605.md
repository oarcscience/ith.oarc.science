<span id="v.v.v.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—</span>9.  Nor is it only you
that are safe, whatever we may be, because you are satisfied with the
very truth of Christ which is in us, in so far as it is preached through
us, and everywhere throughout the world, and because, listening to it
willingly, so far as it is set forth by the humble ministry of our
tongue, you also think well and kindly of us,—for so your hope is in Him
whom we preach to you out of His loving-kindness, which extends over
you,—but further, all of you, who <span id="page_601">p. 601</span>
<span id="v.v.v.viii-Page_601"></span>also received the sacrament of
holy baptism from our ministering, may well rejoice in the same
security, seeing that you were baptized, not into us, but into Christ. 
You did not therefore put on us, but Christ; nor did I ask you whether
you were converted unto me, but unto the living God; nor whether you
believed in me, but in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.  But if
you answered my question with truthful hearts, you were placed in a
state of salvation, not by the putting away of the filth of the flesh,
but by the answer of a good conscience towards God; <span
id="fr_2357"></span>[2358](#fn_2357) not by a fellow-servant, but by the
Lord; not by the herald, but by the judge.  For it is not true, as
Petilianus inconsiderately said, that "the conscience of the giver," or,
as he added "the conscience of him who gives in holiness is what we look
for to wash the conscience of the recipient."  For when something is
given that is of God, it is given in holiness, even by a conscience
which is not holy.  And certainly it is beyond the power of the
recipient to discern whether the said conscience is holy or not holy;
but that which is given he can discern with clearness.  That which is
known to Him who is ever holy is received with perfect safety, whatever
be the character of the minister at whose hands it is received.  For
unless the words which are spoken from Moses’ seat were necessarily
holy, He that is the Truth would never have said, "Whatsoever they bid
you observe, that observe and do."  But if the men who uttered holy
words were themselves holy, He would not have said, "Do not ye after
their works:  for they say, and do not." <span
id="fr_2358"></span>[2359](#fn_2358)   For it is true that in no way do
men gather grapes of thorns, because grapes never spring from the root
of a thorn; but when the shoot of the vine has entwined itself in a
thorn hedge, the fruit which hangs upon it is not therefore looked upon
with dread, but the thorn is avoided, while the grape is plucked.
