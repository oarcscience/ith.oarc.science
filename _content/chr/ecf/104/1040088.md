<span id="iv.vi.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.vi.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—How Evil Men are of God, and Not
of God.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.viii-p2"></span>They might have cited against me those
words of the gospel:  "Ye therefore do not hear, because ye are not of
God;" "Ye are of your father the devil." <span
id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198)   I also should have cited:  "All
things were made by Him and without Him was not anything made," <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199) and this of the Apostle:  "One God of
whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus Christ <span id="page_100">p.
100</span> <span id="iv.vi.viii-Page_100"></span>through whom are all
things," <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200) and again from the same
Apostle:  "Of whom are all things, through whom are all things, in whom
are all things, to Him be glory." <span
id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201)   I should have exhorted those men (if
indeed I had found them men), that we should presume upon nothing as if
we had found it out, but should rather inquire of the masters who would
demonstrate the agreement and harmony of those passages that seem to be
discordant.  For when in one and the same Scriptural authority we read: 
"All things are of God," <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202) and
elsewhere:  "Ye are not of God," since it is wrong rashly to condemn
books of Scripture, who would not have seen that a skilled teacher
should be found who would know a solution of this problem, from whom
assuredly if endowed with good intellectual powers, and a "spiritual
man," as is said by divine inspiration <span
id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203) (for he would necessarily have favored
the true arguments concerning the intelligible and sensible nature,
which, as far as I can, I have conducted and handled, nay he would have
disclosed them far better and more convincingly); we should have heard
nothing else concerning this problem, except, as might happen, that
there is no class of souls but has its existence from God, and that it
is yet rightly said to sinners and unbelievers:  "Ye are not of God." 
For we also, perchance, Divine aid having been implored, should have
been able easily to see, that it is one thing to live and another to
sin, and (although life in sin may be called death in comparison with
just life, <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204) and while in one man
it may be found, that he is at the same time alive and a sinner) that so
far as he is alive, he is of God, so far as he is a sinner he is not of
God.  In which division we use that alternative that suits our
sentiment; so that when we wish to insist upon the omnipotence of God as
Creator, we may say even to sinners that they are of God.  For we are
speaking to those who are contained in some class, we are speaking to
those having animal life, we are speaking to rational beings, we are
speaking lastly—and this applies especially to the matter in hand—to
living beings, all which things are essentially divine functions.  But
when our purpose is to convict evil men, we rightly say:  "Ye are not of
God."  For we speak to them as averse to truth, unbelieving, criminal,
infamous, and, to sum up all in one term—sinners, all of which things
are undoubtedly not of God.  Therefore what wonder is it, if Christ says
to sinners, convicting them of this very thing that they were sinners
and did not believe in Him:  "Ye are not of God;" and on the other hand,
without prejudice to the former statement:  "All things were made
through Him," and "All things are of God?"  For if not to believe
Christ, to repudiate Christ’s advent, not to accept Christ, was a sure
mark of souls that are not of God; and so it was said:  "Ye therefore
hear not, because ye are not of God;" how would that saying of the
apostle be true that occurs in the memorable beginning of the gospel: 
"He came unto his own things, and his own people did not receive
him?" <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205)   Whence his own if they
did not receive him; or whence therefore not his own because they did
not receive him, unless that sinners by virtue of being men belong to
God, but by virtue of being sinners belong to the devil?  He who says: 
"His own people received him not" had reference to nature; but he who
says:  "Ye are not of God." had reference to will; for the evangelist
was commending the works of God, Christ was censuring the sins of men.
