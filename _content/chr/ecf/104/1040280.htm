<p class="c41"><a name="v.iv.v.ii-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.v.ii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 2.&#8212;</span>2.&#160; Nevertheless, I see what may still be required of me, viz., that I should answer those plausible arguments, by which, in even earlier times, Agrippinus, or Cyprian himself, or those in Africa who agreed with them, or any others in far distant lands beyond the sea, were moved, not indeed by the authority of any plenary or even regionary Council, but by a mere epistolary correspondence, to think that they ought to adopt a custom   which had no sanction from the ancient custom of the Church, and which was expressly forbidden by the most unanimous resolution of the Catholic world in order that an error which had begun to creep into the minds of some men, through discussions of this kind, might be cured by the more powerful truth and universal healing power of unity coming on the side of safety.&#160; And so they may see with what security I approach this discourse.&#160; If I am unable to gain my point, and show how those arguments   may be refuted which they bring forward from the Council and the epistles of Cyprian, to the effect that Christ&#146;s baptism may not be given by the hands of heretics, I shall still remain safely in the Church, in whose communion Cyprian himself remained with those who differed from him.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.v.ii-p2"></A>3.&#160; But if they say that the Catholic Church existed then, because there were a few, or, if they prefer it, even a considerable number, who denied the validity of any baptism conferred in an heretical body, and baptized all who came from thence, what then?&#160; Did the Church not exist at all before Agrippinus, with whom that new kind of system began, at variance with all previous custom?&#160; Or how, again after the time of Agrippinus, when, unless there had been a return to   the primitive custom, there would have been no need for Cyprian to set on foot another Council?&#160; Was there no Church then, because such a custom as this prevailed everywhere, that the baptism of Christ should be considered nothing but the baptism of Christ, even though it were proved to have been conferred in a body of heretics or schismatics?&#160; But if the Church existed even then, and had not perished through a breach of its continuity, but was, on the contrary, holding its ground, and   receiving increase in every nation, surely it is the safest plan to abide by this same custom, which then embraced good and bad alike in unity.&#160; But if there was then no Church in existence, because sacrilegious heretics were received without baptism, and this prevailed by universal custom, whence has Donatus made his appearance?&#160; From what land did <A NAME="page_437"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 437</FONT></A> <a name="v.iv.v.ii-Page_437"></A>he spring? or from what sea did he emerge? or from what sky did he fall?&#160; And so we, as I had begun to say, are safe in the communion   of that Church, throughout the whole extent of which the custom now prevails, which prevailed in like manner through its whole extent before the time of Agrippinus, and in the interval between Agrippinus and Cyprian, and whose unity neither Agrippinus nor Cyprian ever deserted, nor those who agreed with them, although they entertained different views from the rest of their brethren&#8212;all of them remaining in the same communion of unity with the very men from whom they differed in opinion.&#160; But   let the Donatists themselves consider what their true position is, if they neither can say whence they derived their origin, if the Church had already been destroyed by the plague-spot of communion with heretics and schismatics received into her bosom without baptism; nor again agree with Cyprian himself, for he declared that he remained in communion with those who received heretics and schismatics, and so also with those who were received as well:&#160; while they have separated themselves from the   communion of the whole world, on account of the charge of having delivered up the sacred books, which they brought against the men whom they maligned in Africa, but failed to convict when brought to trial beyond the sea; although, even had the crimes which they alleged been true, they were much less heinous than the sins of heresy and schism; and yet these could not defile Cyprian in the persons of those who came from them without baptism, as he conceived, and were admitted without baptism into   the Catholic communion.&#160; Nor, in the very point in which they say that they imitate Cyprian, can they find any answer to make about acknowledging the baptism of the followers of Maximianus, together with those whom, though they belonged to the party that they had first condemned in their own plenary Council, and then gone on to prosecute even at the tribunal of the secular power, they yet received back into their communion, in the episcopate of the very same bishop under whom they had been   condemned.&#160; Wherefore, if the communion of wicked men destroyed the Church in the time of Cyprian, they have no source from which they can derive their own communion; and if the Church was not destroyed, they have no excuse for their separation from it.&#160; Moreover, they are neither following the example of Cyprian, since they have burst the bond of unity, nor abiding by their own Council, since they have recognized the baptism of the followers of Maximianus.</p>
