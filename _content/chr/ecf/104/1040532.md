<span id="v.v.iv.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 45.—</span>105.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xlv-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"But if these are the parties, the name of member of a party is no
prejudice against us.  For there are two ways, the one narrow, in which
we walk; the other is for the impious, wherein they shall perish.  And
yet, though the designations be alike, there is a great difference in
the reality, that the way of righteousness should not be defiled by
fellowship in a name. "

<span id="v.v.iv.xlv-p2"></span>106.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xlv-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  You have been
<span id="page_558">p. 558</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.xlv-Page_558"></span>afraid of the comparison of your numbers
with the multitude throughout the world; and therefore, in order to win
praise for the scantiness of your party, you have sought to bring in the
comparison of yourself walking in the narrow path.  Would to God that
you had betaken yourself not to its praise, but to the path itself! 
Truly you would have seen that there was the same scantiness in the
Church of all nations; but that the righteous are said to be few in
comparison with the multitude of the unrighteous, just as, in comparison
with the chaff, there may be said to be few grains of corn in the most
abundant crop, and yet these very grains of themselves, when brought
into a heap, fill the barn.  For the followers of Maximianus themselves
will surpass you in this scantiness of number, if you think that
righteousness consists in this, as well as in the persecution involved
in the loss of places which they held.
