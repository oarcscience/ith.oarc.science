<span id="v.v.iv.lxxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 88.—</span>192.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lxxxviii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span>
said:  "We advise you, therefore, if so be that you will hear it
willingly, and even though you do not willingly receive it, yet we warn
you that the Lord Christ instituted for Christians, not any form of
slaying, but one of dying only.  For if He loved men who thus delight in
battle, He would not have consented to be slain for us."

<span id="v.v.iv.lxxxviii-p2"></span>193.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxxxviii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  Would that
your martyrs would follow the form that He prescribed! they would not
throw themselves over precipices, which He refused to do at the bidding
of the devil. <span id="fr_2212"></span>[2213](#fn_2212)   But when you
persecute our ancestors with false witness even now that they are dead,
whence have you received this form?  In that you endeavor to stain us
with the crimes of men we never knew, while you are unwilling that the
most notorious misdeeds of your own party should be reckoned against
you, whence have you received this form?  But we are too much yielding
to our own conceit if we find fault about ourselves, when we see that
you utter false testimony against the Lord Himself, since He Himself
both promised and made manifest that His Church should extend throughout
all nations, and you maintain the contrary.  This form, therefore, you
did not receive even from the Jewish persecutors themselves, for they
persecuted His body while He was walking on the earth:  you persecute
His gospel as He is seated in heaven.  Which gospel endured more meekly
the flames of furious kings than it can possibly endure your tongues;
for while they blazed, unity remained, and this it cannot do amid your
words.  They who desired that the word of God should perish in the
flames did not believe that it could be despised if read.  They would
not, therefore, set their flames to work upon the gospel, if you would
let them use your tongues against the gospel.  In the earlier
persecution the gospel of Christ was <span id="page_576">p. 576</span>
<span id="v.v.iv.lxxxviii-Page_576"></span>sought by some in their rage,
it was betrayed by others in their fear; it was burned by some in their
rage, it was hidden by others in their love; it was attacked, but none
were found to speak against its truth.  The more accursed share of
persecution was reserved for you when the persecution of the heathen was
exhausted.  Those who persecuted the name of Christ believed in Christ: 
now those who are honored for the name of Christ are found to speak
against His truth.
