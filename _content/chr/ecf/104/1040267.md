<span id="v.iv.iv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—</span>6.  And so it is that often
something is imperfectly revealed to the more learned, that their
patient and humble charity, from which proceeds the greater fruit, may
be proved, either in the way in which they preserve unity, when they
hold different opinions on matters of comparative obscurity, or in the
temper with which they receive the truth, when they learn that it has
been declared to be contrary to what they thought.  And of these two we
have a manifestation in the blessed Cyprian of the one, viz., of the
<span id="page_428">p. 428</span> <span
id="v.iv.iv.v-Page_428"></span>way in which he preserved unity with
those from whom he differed in opinion.  For he says, "Judging no one
nor depriving any one of the right of communion if he differ from
us." <span id="fr_1220"></span>[1221](#fn_1220)   And the other, viz.,
in what temper he could receive the truth when found to be different
from what he thought it, though his letters are silent on the point, is
yet proclaimed by his merits.  If there is no letter extant to prove it,
it is witnessed by his crown of martyrdom; if the Council of bishops
declare it not, it is declared by the host of angels.  For it is no
small proof of a most peaceful soul, that he won the crown of martyrdom
in that unity from which he would not separate, even though he differed
from it.  For we are but men; and it is therefore a temptation incident
to men that we should hold views at variance with the truth on any
point.  But to come through too great love for our own opinion, or
through jealousy of our betters, even to the sacrilege of dividing the
communion of the Church, and of founding heresy or schism, is a
presumption worthy of the devil.  But never in any point to entertain an
opinion at variance with the truth is perfection found only in the
angels.  Since then we are men, yet forasmuch as in hope we are angels,
whose equals we shall be in the resurrection, <span
id="fr_1221"></span>[1222](#fn_1221) at any rate, so long as we are
wanting in the perfection of angels, let us at least be without the
presumption of the devil.  Accordingly the apostle says, "There hath no
temptation taken you but such as is common to man." <span
id="fr_1222"></span>[1223](#fn_1222)   It is therefore part of man’s
nature to be sometimes wrong.  Wherefore he says in another place, "Let
us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded:  and if in anything
ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you." <span
id="fr_1223"></span>[1224](#fn_1223)   But to whom does He reveal it
when it is His will (be it in this life or in the life to come), save to
those who walk in the way of peace, and stray not aside into any
schism?  Not to such as those who have not known the way of peace, <span
id="fr_1224"></span>[1225](#fn_1224) or for some other cause have broken
the bond of unity.  And so, when the apostle said, "And if in anything
ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you," lest they
should think that besides the way of peace their own wrong views might
be revealed to them, he immediately added, "Nevertheless, whereto we
have already attained, let us walk by the same rule." <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[1226](#fn_1225)   And Cyprian, walking by this
rule, by the most persistent tolerance, not simply by the shedding of
his blood, but because it was shed in unity (for if he gave his body to
be burned, and had not charity, it would profit him nothing <span
id="fr_1226"></span>[1227](#fn_1226) ), came by the confession of
martyrdom to the light of the angels, and if not before, at least then,
acknowledged the revelation of the truth on that point on which, while
yet in error, he did not prefer the maintenance of a wrong opinion to
the bond of unity.
