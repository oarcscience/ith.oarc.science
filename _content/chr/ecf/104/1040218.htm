<p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.xxxvi-p2"></A>Likewise because sin, or unrighteousness, is not the striving after evil nature but the desertion of better, it is thus found written in the Scriptures:&#160; "Every creature of God is good."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1127"></A><A HREF="#fn_1127"><FONT SIZE="1">1128</FONT></A>
&#160; And accordingly every tree also which God planted in Paradise is assuredly good.&#160; Man did not therefore strive after an evil nature when he touched the forbidden tree; but by deserting what was better, he committed an evil deed.&#160; Since the Creator is better than any creature which He has made, His command should not have been deserted, that the thing forbidden, however good, might be touched; since the better having been deserted, the good of the creature was striven for, which was touched contrary to the command of the Creator.&#160; God did not plant an evil tree in Paradise; but He Himself was better who prohibited its being touched.</p>
