<p class="c41"><a name="v.iv.v.iii-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.v.iii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 3.&#8212;</span>4.&#160; Let us therefore, seeing that we adhere to the example of Cyprian, go on now to consider Cyprian&#146;s Council.&#160; What says Cyprian?&#160; "Ye have heard," he says, "most beloved colleagues, what Jubaianus our fellow-bishop has written to me, consulting my moderate ability concerning the unlawful and profane baptism of heretics, and what answer I gave him,&#8212;giving a judgment which we have once and again and often given, that   heretics coming to the Church ought to be baptized and sanctified with the baptism of the Church.&#160; Another letter of Jubaianus has likewise been read to you, in which, agreeably to his sincere and religious devotion, in answer to our epistle, he not only expressed his assent, but returned thanks also, acknowledging that he had received instruction."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1264"></A><A HREF="#fn_1264"><FONT SIZE="1">1265</FONT></A>
&#160; In these words of the blessed Cyprian, we find that he had been consulted by Jubaianus, and what answer he had given to his questions, and how Jubaianus acknowledged with gratitude that he had received instruction.&#160; Ought we then to be thought unreasonably persistent if we desire to consider this same epistle by which Jubaianus was convinced?&#160; For till such time as we are also convinced (if there are any arguments of truth whereby this can be done), Cyprian himself has   established our security by the right of Catholic communion.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.v.iii-p3"></A>5.&#160; For he goes on to say:&#160; "It remains that we severally declare our opinion on this same subject, judging no one, nor depriving any one of the right of communion if he differ from us."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1265"></A><A HREF="#fn_1265"><FONT SIZE="1">1266</FONT></A>
&#160; He allows me, therefore, without losing the right of communion, not only to continue inquiring into the truth, but even to hold opinions differing from his own.&#160; "For no one of us," he says, "setteth himself up as a bishop of bishops, or by tyrannical terror forces his colleagues to a necessity of obeying."&#160; What could be more kind? what more humble?&#160; Surely there is here no authority restraining us from inquiry into what is truth.&#160; "Inasmuch as every bishop," he says,   "in the free use of his liberty and power, has the right of forming his own judgment, and can no more be judged by another than he can himself judge another,"&#8212;that is, I suppose, in those questions which have not yet been brought to perfect clearness of solution; for he knew what a deep question about the sacrament was then occupying the whole Church with every kind of disputation, and gave free liberty of inquiry to every man, that the truth might be made known by investigation.&#160; For he was   surely not uttering what was false, and trying to catch his simpler colleagues in their <A NAME="page_438"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 438</FONT></A> <a name="v.iv.v.iii-Page_438"></A>speech, so that, when they should have betrayed that they held opinions at variance with his, he might then propose, in violation of his promise, that they should be excommunicated.&#160; Far be it from a soul so holy to entertain such accursed treachery; indeed, they who hold such a view about such a man, thinking that it conduces to his praise, do but show that it would be in   accordance with their own nature.&#160; I for my part will in no wise believe that Cyprian, a Catholic bishop, a Catholic martyr, whose greatness only made him proportionately humble in all things, so as to find favor before the Lord,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1266"></A><A HREF="#fn_1266"><FONT SIZE="1">1267</FONT></A>
 should ever, especially in the sacred Council of his colleagues, have uttered with his mouth what was not echoed in his heart, especially as he further adds, "But we must all await the judgment of our Lord Jesus Christ, who alone has the power both of setting us in the government of His Church, and of judging of our acts therein."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1267"></A><A HREF="#fn_1267"><FONT SIZE="1">1268</FONT></A>
&#160; When, then, he called to their remembrance so solemn a judgment, hoping to hear the truth from his colleagues, would he first set them the example of lying?&#160; May God avert such madness from every Christian man, and how much more from Cyprian!&#160; We have therefore the free liberty of inquiry granted to us by the most moderate and most truthful speech of Cyprian.</p>
