id="v.v.v.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—</span>10.  Therefore, as I have
often said before, and am desirous to bring home to you, whatsoever we
may be, you are safe, who have God for your Father and His Church for
your mother.  For although the goats may feed in company with the sheep,
yet they shall not stand on the right hand; although the chaff may be
bruised together with the wheat, it shall not be gathered into the barn;
although the bad fish may swim in company with the good within the
Lord’s nets, they shall not be gathered into vessels.  Let no man make
his boast even in a good man:  let no man shun the good gifts of God
even in a bad man.
