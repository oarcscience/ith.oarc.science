<p class="c41"><a name="v.v.iv.li-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.li-p1.1"></A>Chapter 51.&#8212;</span>117.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.li-p1.2"></A>Petilianus</span> said:&#160; "If you wretched men claim for yourselves a seat, as we said before, you assuredly have that one of which the prophet and psalmist David speaks as being the seat of the scornful.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2133"></A><A HREF="#fn_2133"><FONT SIZE="1">2134</FONT></A>
&#160; For to you it is rightly left, seeing that the holy cannot sit therein."</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.li-p3"></A>118.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.li-p3.1"></A>Augustin</span> answered:&#160; Here again you do not see that this is no kind of argument, <A NAME="page_561"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 561</FONT></A> <a name="v.v.iv.li-Page_561"></A>but empty abuse.&#160; For this is what I said a little while ago, You utter the words of the law, but take no heed against whom you utter them; just as the devil uttered the words of the law, but failed to perceive to whom he uttered them.&#160; He wished to thrust down our Head, who was presently to ascend on high; but you wish to   reduce to a small fraction the body of that same Head which is dispersed throughout the entire world.&#160; Certainly you yourself said a little time before that we know the law, and speak in legal terms, but blush in our deeds.&#160; Thus much indeed you say without a proof of anything; but even though you were to prove it of some men, you would not be entitled to assert it of these others.&#160; However, if all men throughout all the world were of the character which you most vainly charge them with, what   has the chair done to you of the Roman Church, in which Peter sat, and which Anastasius fills to-day; or the chair of the Church of Jerusalem, in which James once sat, and in which John sits today, with which we are united in catholic unity, and from which you have severed yourselves by your mad fury?&#160; Why do you call the apostolic chair a seat of the scornful?&#160; If it is on account of the men whom you believe to use the words of the law without performing it, do you find that our Lord Jesus   Christ was moved by the Pharisees, of whom He says, "They say, and do not," to do any despite to the seat in which they sat?&#160; Did He not commend the seat of Moses, and maintain the honor of the seat, while He convicted those that sat in it?&#160; For He says, "They sit in Moses&#146; seat:&#160; all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works:&#160; for they say, and do not."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2134"></A><A HREF="#fn_2134"><FONT SIZE="1">2135</FONT></A>
&#160; If you were to think of these things, you would not, on account of men whom you calumniate, do despite to the apostolic seat, in which you have no share.&#160; But what else is conduct like yours but ignorance of what to say, combined with want of power to abstain from evil-speaking?</p>
