<span id="iv.iv.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—Of Justice and Prudence.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xxvi-p2"></span>44.  What of justice that pertains to
God?  As the Lord says, "Ye cannot serve two masters," <span
id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116) and the apostle denounces those who
serve the creature rather than the Creator, <span
id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117) was it not said before in the Old
Testament, "Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou
serve?" <span id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118)   I need say no more on
this, for these books are full of such passages.  The lover, then, whom
we are describing, will get from justice this rule of life, that he must
with perfect readiness serve the God whom he loves, the highest good,
the highest wisdom, the highest peace; <span
id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119) and as regards all other things, must
either rule them as subject to himself, or treat them with a view to
their subjection.  This rule of life, is, as we have shown, confirmed by
the authority of both Testaments.

<span id="iv.iv.xxvi-p7"></span>45.  With equal brevity we must treat of
prudence, to which it belongs to discern between what is to be desired
and what to be shunned.  Without this, nothing can be done of what we
have already spoken of.  It is the part of prudence to keep watch with
most anxious vigilance, lest any evil influence should stealthily creep
in upon us.  Thus the Lord often exclaims, "Watch;" <span
id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120) and He says, "Walk while ye have the
light, lest darkness come upon you." <span
id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121)   And then it is said, "Know ye not
that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?" <span
id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122)   And no passage can be quoted from
the Old Testament more expressly condemning this mental somnolence,
which makes us insensible to destruction advancing on us step by step,
than those words of the prophet, "He who despiseth small things shall
fall by degrees." <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123)   On this
topic I might discourse at length did our haste allow of it.  And did
our present task demand it, we might perhaps prove the depth of these
mysteries, by making a mock of which profane men in their perfect
ignorance fall, not certainly by degrees, but with a headlong overthrow.
