<span id="v.v.iv.lv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 55.—</span>125.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lv-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"Even though you do very virtuous actions, and perform miraculous works,
yet on account of your wickedness the Lord does not know you; even so,
according to the words of the Lord Himself, ‘Many will say to me in that
day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name? and in Thy name
have cast out devils? and in Thy name done many wonderful works?  And
then will I profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from me, ye that
work iniquity.’" <span id="fr_2143"></span>[2144](#fn_2143)

<span id="v.v.iv.lv-p3"></span>126.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lv-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  We acknowledge the
word of the Lord.  Hence also the apostle says, "Though I have all
faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am
nothing." <span id="fr_2144"></span>[2145](#fn_2144)   Here therefore we
must inquire who it is that has charity:  you will find that it is no
one else but those who are lovers of unity.  For as to the driving out
of devils, and as to the working of miracles, seeing that very many do
not do such things who yet belong to the kingdom of God, and very many
do them who do not belong to it, neither our party nor your party have
any cause for boasting, if any of them chance to have this power, since
the Lord did not think it right that even the apostles, who could truly
do such things both to profit and salvation, should boast in things like
this, when He says to them, "In this rejoice not, that the spirits are
subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in
heaven." <span id="fr_2145"></span>[2146](#fn_2145)   Wherefore all
those things which you have advanced from the writings of the gospel I
also might repeat to you, if I saw you working the powerful acts of
signs and miracles; and so might you repeat them to me, if you saw me
doing things of a like sort.  Let us not, therefore, say one to another
what may equally be said on the other side as well; and, putting aside
all quibbles, since we are inquiring where the Church of Christ is to be
found, let us listen to the words of Christ Himself, who redeemed it
with His own blood:  "Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem,
and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and even in the whole earth." <span
id="fr_2146"></span>[2147](#fn_2146)   You see then who it is with whom
a man refuses to communicate who will not communicate with this Church,
which is spread throughout all the world, if at least you hear whose
words these are.  For what is a greater proof of madness than to hold
communion with the sacraments of the Lord, and to refuse to hold
communion with the words of the Lord?  Such men at any rate are likely
to say, In Thy name have we eaten and drunken, and to hear the words, "I
never knew you,"  <span id="fr_2147"></span>[2148](#fn_2147) seeing that
they eat His body and drink His blood in the sacrament, and do not
recognize in the gospel His members which are spread abroad throughout
the earth, and therefore are not themselves counted among them in the
judgment.
