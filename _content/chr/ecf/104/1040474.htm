<p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iii.xvii-p2"></A>19.&#160; But whatever he seemed to himself to say by way of accusation about the traitor Judas, I see not how it can concern us, who are not proved by them to have betrayed our trust; nor, indeed, if such treason were proved on the part of any who before our time have died in our communion, would that treason in any way defile us by whom it was disavowed, and to whom it was displeasing.&#160; For if they themselves are not defiled by offenses condemned by themselves, and   afterwards condoned, how much less can we be defiled by what we have disavowed so soon as we have heard of them!&#160; However weighty, therefore, his invective against <i> traditors</i>, let him be assured that they are condemned by me in precisely the same terms.&#160; But yet I make a distinction; for he accuses one on my side who has long been dead without having been condemned in any investigation made by me.&#160; I point to a man adhering closely to his side, who had been condemned by him, or at least   had been separated by a sacrilegious schism, and whom he received again with undiminished honor.</p>
