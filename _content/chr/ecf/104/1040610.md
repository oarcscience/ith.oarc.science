<span id="v.v.v.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—</span>14.  If, therefore, I am
a servant of the Lord, and a soldier that is not reprobate, with
whatever eloquence Petilianus stands forth reviling me, ought I in any
way to be annoyed that he has been appointed for <span id="page_603">p.
603</span> <span id="v.v.v.xiii-Page_603"></span>me as a most
accomplished craftsman of the armor on the left?  It is necessary that I
should fight in this armor as skillfully as possible in defence of my
Lord, and should smite with it the enemy against whom I wage an unseen
fight, who in all cunning strives and endeavors, with the most perverse
and ancient craftiness, that this should lead me to hate Petilianus, and
so be unable to fulfill the command which Christ has given, that we
should "love our enemies." <span id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364)  
But from this may I be saved by the mercy of Him who loved me, and gave
Himself for me, so that, as He hung upon the cross, He said, "Father,
forgive them; for they know not what they do;" <span
id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365) and so taught me to say of
Petilianus and all other enemies of mine like him "Father, forgive them;
for they know not what they do.’
