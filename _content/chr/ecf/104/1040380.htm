 said:&#160; "He who says that heretics have the power of baptizing should first say who it was that founded heresy.&#160; For if heresy is of God, it may have the divine favor; but if it be not of God, how can it either have or confer on any one the grace of God?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1687"></A><A HREF="#fn_1687"><FONT SIZE="1">1688</FONT></A>
