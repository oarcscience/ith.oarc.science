<span id="v.iv.viii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29.—</span>55. Cassius of
Macomades <span id="fr_1694"></span>[1695](#fn_1694) said:  "Since there
cannot be two baptisms, he who grants baptism unto heretics takes it
away from himself.  I therefore declare my judgment that heretics, those
objects for our tears, those masses of corruption, <span
id="fr_1695"></span>[1696](#fn_1695) should be baptized when they begin
to come to the Church, and that so being washed by the sacred and divine
laver, and enlightened with the light of life, they may be received into
the Church,—as being now made not enemies, but peaceful; not strangers,
but of the household of the faith of the Lord; not bastards, <span
id="fr_1696"></span>[1697](#fn_1696) but sons of God; partaking not of
error, but of salvation,—with the exception of those who, being
believers transplanted from the Church, had gone over to heresy, and
that these should be restored by the laying on of hands." <span
id="fr_1697"></span>[1698](#fn_1697)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxix-p6"></span>56.  Another might say:  Since there
cannot be two baptisms, he who grants baptism to the unrighteous takes
it away from himself.  But even our opponents would join us in resisting
such a man when he says that we grant baptism to the unrighteous, which
is not of the unrighteous, like their unrighteousness, but of Christ, of
whom is righteousness, and whose sacrament, even among the unrighteous,
is not unrighteous.  What, therefore, they would join us in saying of
the unrighteous, that let them say to themselves of heretics.  And
therefore he should rather have said as follows:  I therefore give my
judgment that heretics, those objects for our tears, those masses of
corruption, should not be baptized when they begin to come to the
Church, if they already have the baptism of Christ, but should be
corrected from their error.  For we may similarly say of the
unrighteous, of whom the heretics are a part:  I therefore give <span
id="page_493">p. 493</span> <span id="v.iv.viii.xxix-Page_493"></span>my
judgment that the unrighteous, those objects for our tears, and masses
of corruption, if they have been already baptized, should not be
baptized again when they begin to come to the Church, that is, to that
rock outside which are all who hear the words of Christ and do them not;
but being already washed with the sacred and divine laver, and now
further enlightened with the light of truth, should be received into the
Church no longer as enemies but as peaceful, for the unrighteous have no
peace; no longer as strangers, but of the household of the faith of the
Lord, for to the unrighteous it is said, "How then art thou turned into
the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?" <span
id="fr_1698"></span>[1699](#fn_1698) no longer as bastards, but the sons
of God, for the unrighteous are the sons of the devil, partaking not of
error but of salvation, for un-righteousness cannot save.  And by the
Church I mean that rock, that dove, that garden enclosed and fountain
sealed, which is recognized only in the wheat, not in the chaff, whether
that be scattered far apart by the wind, or appear to be mingled with
the corn even till the last winnowing.  In vain, therefore, did Cassius
add, "With the exception of those who, being believers transplanted from
the Church, had gone over to heresy."  For if even they themselves had
lost baptism by seceding, to themselves also let it be restored; but if
they had not lost it, let what was given by them receive due
recognition.

otherwise taken of the repentant heretics "Melting with the grief and
wretchedness of penitence;" but Bishop Fell points out that the
interpretation in the text is supported by an expression in c. 33, 63:
