id="iv.x.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—God Cannot Suffer Harm, Nor Can
Any Other Nature Except by His Permission.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xiii-p2"></span>Wherefore neither can God’s nature suffer
harm, nor can any nature under God suffer harm unjustly:  for when by
sinning unjustly some do harm, an unjust will is imputed to them; but
the power by which they are permitted to do harm is from God alone, who
knows, while they themselves are ignorant, what they ought to suffer,
whom He permits them to harm.
