<p class="c41"><a name="v.v.iv.xliii-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xliii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 43.&#8212;</span>101.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xliii-p1.2"></A>Petilianus</span> said:&#160; "Can it be that the traitor Judas hung himself for you, or did he imbue you with his character, that, following his deeds, you should seize on the treasures of the Church, and sell for money to the powers of this world us who are the heirs of Christ?"</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.xliii-p2"></A>102.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xliii-p2.1"></A>Augustin</span> answered:&#160; Judas did not die for us, but Christ, to whom the Church dispersed throughout the world says, "So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me:&#160; for I trust in Thy word."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2116"></A><A HREF="#fn_2116"><FONT SIZE="1">2117</FONT></A>
&#160; When, therefore, I hear the words of the Lord, saying, "Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and even in the whole earth,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2117"></A><A HREF="#fn_2117"><FONT SIZE="1">2118</FONT></A>
 and through the voice of His prophet, "Their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words into the ends of the world,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2118"></A><A HREF="#fn_2118"><FONT SIZE="1">2119</FONT></A>
 no bodily admixture of evil ever is able to disturb me, if I know how to say, "Be surety for Thy servant for good:&#160; let not the proud oppress me."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2119"></A><A HREF="#fn_2119"><FONT SIZE="1">2120</FONT></A>
&#160; I do not, therefore, concern myself about a vain calumniation when I have a substantial promise.&#160; But if you complain about matters or places appertaining to the Church, which you used once to hold, and hold no longer, then the Jews also may say that they are righteous, and reproach us with unrighteousness, because the Christians now occupy the place in which of old they impiously reigned.&#160; What then is there unfitting, if, according to a similar will of the Lord, the   Catholics now hold the things which formerly the heretics used to have?&#160; For against all such men as this, that is to say, against all impious and unrighteous men, those words of the Lord have force, "The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2120"></A><A HREF="#fn_2120"><FONT SIZE="1">2121</FONT></A>
 or is it written in vain, "The righteous shall eat of the labors of the impious"?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2121"></A><A HREF="#fn_2121"><FONT SIZE="1">2122</FONT></A>
&#160; Wherefore you ought rather to be amazed that you still possess something, than that there is something which you have lost.&#160; But neither need you wonder even at this, for it is by degrees that the whitened wall falls down.&#160; Yet look back at the followers of Maximianus, see what places they possessed, and by whose agency and under whose attacks they were driven from them, and do you venture, if you can, to say that to suffer things like these is righteousness, while to do   them is unrighteousness.&#160; In the first place, because you did the deed, and they suffered them; and secondly, because, according to the rule of this righteousness, you are found to be inferior.&#160; For they were driven from the ancient palaces by Catholic emperors acting through judges, while you are not even driven forth by the mandates of the emperors themselves from the basilicas of unity.&#160; For what reason is this, save that you are of less merit, not only than the rest of your colleagues, but   even than those very men whom you assuredly condemned as guilty of sacrilege by the mouth of your plenary Council?</p>
