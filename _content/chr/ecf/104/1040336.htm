&#160; Truly he belongs most closely to it; but the others, who must be separated from it either by the occasion of some scandal, or by the winnowing at the last day, do not by any means belong to it, and yet baptism was repeated after John and not after them.&#160; What then is the cause, except that the baptism which Paul ordered them to receive was not the same as that which was given at the hands of John?&#160; And so in the same unity of the Church, the baptism of Christ cannot be   repeated though it be given by an usurious minister; but those who receive the baptism of John, even from the hands of John Himself, ought to be afterwards baptized with the baptism of Christ.</p>
