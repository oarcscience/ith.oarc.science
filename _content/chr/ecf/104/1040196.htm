<p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.xiv-p2"></A>All these things are so perspicuous, so assured, that if they who introduce another nature which God did not make, were willing to give attention, they would not be filled with so great blasphemies, as that they should place so great good things in supreme evil, and so great evil things in God.&#160; For what the truth compels them to acknowledge, namely, that all good things are from God alone, suffices for their correction, if they were willing to give heed, as I said above.&#160; Not, therefore, are great good things from one, and small good things from another; but good things great and small are from the supremely good alone, which is God.</p>
