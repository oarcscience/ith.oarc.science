<span id="v.v.v.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36.—</span>42.  But after this,
when Petilianus came to that objection of ours, that they allowed the
baptism of the followers of Maximianus, whom they had condemned, <span
id="fr_2399"></span>[2400](#fn_2399) —although in the statement of this
question he thought it right to use his own words rather than mine; for
neither do we assert that the baptism of sinners is of profit to us,
seeing that we maintain it to belong not only to no sinners, but to no
men whatsoever, in that we are satisfied that it is Christ’s
alone,—having put the question in this form, he says, "Yet you
obstinately aver that it is right that <span id="page_614">p. 614</span>
<span id="v.v.v.xxxvi-Page_614"></span>the baptism of sinners should be
of profit to you, because we too, according to your statement,
maintained the baptism of criminals whom we justly condemned."  When he
came to this question, as I said before, even all the show of fight
which he had made deserted him.  He could not find any way to go, any
means of escape, any path by which, either through subtle watching or
bold enterprise, he could either secretly steal away, or sally forth by
force.  "Although this," he says, "I will demonstrate in my second book,
how great the difference is between those of our party and those of
yours whom you call innocent, yet, in the meantime, first extricate
yourselves from the offenses with which you are acquainted in your
colleagues, and then seek out the mode of dealing with those whom we
cast out."  Would any one, any man upon the earth, give an answer like
this, save one who is setting himself against the truth, against which
he cannot find any answer that can be made?  Accordingly, if we too were
to use the same words:  In the meantime, first extricate yourselves from
the offenses with which you are acquainted in your colleagues, and then
bring up against us any charge connected with those whom you hold to be
wicked amongst us,—what is the result?  Have we both won the victory, or
are we both defeated?  Nay, rather He has gained the victory for His
Church and in His Church, who has taught us in His Scriptures that no
man should glory in men, and that he that glorieth should glory in the
Lord.  <span id="fr_2400"></span>[2401](#fn_2400)   For behold in our
case who assert with the eloquence of truth that the man who believes is
not justified by him by whom he is baptized, but by Him of whom it is
written, "To him that believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his
faith is counted for righteousness," <span
id="fr_2401"></span>[2402](#fn_2401) since we do not glory in men, and
strive, when we glory, to glory in the Lord in virtue of His own gift,
how wholly safe are we, whatever fault or charge Petilianus may have
been able to prove concerning certain men of our communion!  For among
us, whatever wicked men are either wholly undetected, or, being known to
certain persons, are yet tolerated for the sake of the bond of unity and
peace, in consideration of other good men to whom their wickedness is
unknown, and before whom they could not be convicted, in order that the
wheat may not be rooted up together with the tares, yet they so bear the
burden of their own wickedness, that no one shares it with them except
those who are pleased with their unrighteousness.  Nor indeed have we
any apprehension that those whom they baptize cannot be justified, since
they believe in Him that justifieth the ungodly that their faith may be
counted for righteousness. <span id="fr_2402"></span>[2403](#fn_2402)
