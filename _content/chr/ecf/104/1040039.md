<span id="iv.iv.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—Only in the Catholic Church is
Perfect Truth Established on the Harmony of Both Testaments.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xx-p2"></span>33.  I could, according to the little
ability I have, take up the points separately, and could expound and
prove the truths I have learned, which are generally more excellent and
lofty than words can express; but this <span id="page_51">p. 51</span>
<span id="iv.iv.xx-Page_51"></span>cannot be done while you bark at it. 
For not in vain is it said, "Give not that which is holy to dogs." <span
id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89)   Do not be angry.  I too barked and was
a dog; and then, as was right, instead of the food of teaching, I got
the rod of correction.  But were there in you that love of which we are
speaking, or should it ever be in you as much as the greatness of the
truth to be known requires, may God vouchsafe to show you that neither
is there among the Manichæans the Christian faith which leads to the
summit of wisdom and truth, the attainment of which is the true happy
life, nor is it anywhere but in the Catholic teaching.  Is not this what
the Apostle Paul appears to desire when he says, "For this cause I bow
my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom the whole
family in heaven and earth is named, that He would grant unto you,
according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might by
His Spirit in the inner man:  that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to
comprehend with all saints what is the height, and length, and breadth,
and depth, and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that
ye may be filled with all the fullness of God?" <span
id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90)   Could anything be more plainly
expressed?

<span id="iv.iv.xx-p5"></span>34.  Wake up a little, I beseech you, and
see the harmony of both Testaments, making it quite plain and certain
what should be the manner of life in our conduct, and to what all things
should be referred.  To the love of God we are incited by the gospel,
when it is said, "Ask, seek, knock;" <span
id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91) by Paul, when he says, "That ye, being
rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend;" <span
id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92) by the prophet also, when he says that
wisdom can easily be known by those who love it, seek for it, desire it,
watch for it, think about it, care for it.  The salvation of the
mind <span id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93) and the way of happiness is
pointed out by the concord of both Scriptures; and yet you choose rather
to bark at these things than to obey them.  I will tell you in one word
what I think.  Do you listen to the learned men of the Catholic Church
with as peaceable a disposition, and with the same zeal, that I had when
for nine years I attended on you: <span id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94)  
there will be no need of so long a time as that during which you made a
fool of me.  In a much, a very much, shorter time you will see the
difference between truth and vanity.
