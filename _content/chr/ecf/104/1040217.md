<span id="iv.x.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.x.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—That Evil Angels Have Been Made
Evil, Not by God, But by Sinning.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xxxv-p2"></span>But because evil angels also were not
constituted evil by God, but were made evil by sinning, Peter in his
epistle says:  "For if God spared not angels when they sinned, but
casting them down into the dungeons of smoky hell, He delivered them to
be reserved for punishment in judgment." <span
id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124)   Hence Peter shows that there is
still due to them the penalty of the last judgment, concerning which the
Lord says:  "Go ye into everlasting fire, which has been prepared for
the Devil and his angels."  Although they have already penally received
this hell, that is, an inferior smoky air as a prison, which
nevertheless since it is also called heaven, is not that heaven in which
there are stars, but this lower heaven by the smoke of which the clouds
are conglobulated, and where the birds fly; for both a cloudy heaven is
spoken of, and flying things are called heavenly.  As when the Apostle
Paul calls those evil angels, against whom as enemies by living piously
we contend, "spiritual things of wickedness in heavenly places." <span
id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125)   That this may not be understood
of the upper heavens, he plainly says elsewhere:  "According to the
presence of the prince of this air, who now worketh in the sons of
disobedience." <span id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126)
