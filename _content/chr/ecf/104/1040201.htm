<p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.xix-p2"></A>No nature, therefore, as far as it is nature, is evil; but to each nature there is no evil except to be diminished in respect of good.&#160; But if by being diminished it should be consumed so that there is no good, no nature would be left; not only such as the Manich&aelig;ans introduce, where so great good things are found that their exceeding blindness is wonderful, but such as any one can introduce.</p>
