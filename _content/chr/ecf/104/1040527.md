id="v.v.iv.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40.—</span>95.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xl-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"Paul the apostle also bids us, ‘Be ye not unequally yoked with
unbelievers:  for what fellowship hath righteousness with
unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? and what
concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth
with an infidel?’" <span id="fr_2114"></span>[2115](#fn_2114)

<span id="v.v.iv.xl-p3"></span>96.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xl-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  I recognize the
words of the apostle; but how they can help you I cannot see at all. 
For which of us says that there is any fellowship between righteousness
and unrighteousness, even though the righteous and the unrighteous, as
in the case of Judas and Peter, should be alike partakers of the
sacraments?  For from one and the same holy thing Judas received
judgment to himself and Peter salvation, just as you received the
sacrament with Optatus, and, if you were unlike him, were not therefore
partakers in his robberies.  Or is robbery not unrighteousness?  Who
would be mad enough to assert that?  What fellowship was there, then, on
the part of your righteousness with his unrighteousness, when you
approached together to the same altar?
