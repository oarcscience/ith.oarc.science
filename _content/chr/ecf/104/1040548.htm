<p class="c41"><a name="v.v.iv.lxi-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.lxi-p1.1"></A>Chapter</span>  61.&#8212;137.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.lxi-p1.2"></A>Petilianus</span> said:&#160; "But the Lord Christ says, &#145;Whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.&#146;&#160; But He condemns you wretched men as follows:&#160; &#145;Whosoever shall break one of these commandments, he shalt be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.&#146;"</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.lxi-p2"></A>138.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.lxi-p2.1"></A>Augustin</span> answered:&#160; When you happen to quote the testimony of Scripture as other than it really is, and it does not bear on the question which is at issue between us, I am not greatly concerned; but when it interferes with the matter on hand, unless it is quoted truly, then I think that you have no right to find fault if I remind you how the passage really stands.&#160; For you must be aware that the verse which you quoted is not as you   quoted it, but rather thus:&#160; "Whosoever shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven; but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."&#160; And immediately He continues, "For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2153"></A><A HREF="#fn_2153"><FONT SIZE="1">2154</FONT></A>
&#160; For elsewhere He shows and proves of the Pharisees that they say and do not.&#160; It is these, therefore, to whom He is referring also here, when He said, "Whosoever shall break one of these commandments, and shall teach men so,"&#8212;that is, shall teach in words what he has violated in deeds; whose righteousness He says that our righteousness must excel, in that we must both keep the commandments and teach men so.&#160; And yet not even on account of those Pharisees, with whom you   compare us,&#8212;not from any motives of prudence, but from malice,&#8212;did our Lord enjoin that the seat of Moses should be deserted, which seat He doubtless meant to be a figure of His own; for He said indeed that they who sat in Moses&#146; seat were ever saying and not doing, but warns the people to do what they say, and not to do what they do,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2154"></A><A HREF="#fn_2154"><FONT SIZE="1">2155</FONT></A>
 lest the chair, with all its holiness, should be deserted, and the unity of the flock divided through the faithlessness of the shepherds.</p>
