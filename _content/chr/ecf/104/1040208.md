<span id="iv.x.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.x.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—It is Proved by the Testimonies
of Scripture that God is Unchangeable.  The Son of God Begotten, Not
Made.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xxvi-p2"></span>Those things which our faith holds and
which reason in whatever way has traced out, are fortified by the
testimonies of the divine Scriptures, so that those who by reason of
feebler intellect are not able to comprehend these things, may believe
the divine authority, and so may deserve to know.  But let not those who
understand, but are less instructed in ecclesiastical literature,
suppose that we set forth these things from our own intellect rather
than what are in those Books.  Accordingly, that God is unchangeable is
written in the Psalms:  "Thou shalt change them and they shall be
changed; but Thou thyself art the same." <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095)   And in the book of Wisdom,
concerning wisdom:  "Remaining in herself, she renews all things." <span
id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096)   Whence also the Apostle Paul: 
"To the invisible, incorruptible, only God." <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[1098](#fn_1097)   And the Apostle James:  "Every
best giving and every perfect gift is from above, descending from the
Father of light, with whom there is no changeableness, neither obscuring
of influence." <span id="fr_1098"></span>[1099](#fn_1098)   Likewise
because what He begat of Himself is what He Himself is, it is said in
brief by the Son Himself:  "I and the Father are one." <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099)   But because the Son was not made,
since through Him were all things made, thus it is written:  "In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word;
this was in the beginning with God.  All things were made through Him,
and without Him was made nothing;" <span
id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100) that is, without Him was not
anything made.
