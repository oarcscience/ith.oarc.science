<span id="v.iv.v.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span

Cyprian shows that it was no new or sudden thing that he decided,
because the practice had already begun under Agrippinus.  "Many years,"
he says, "and much time has passed away since, under Agrippinus of
honored memory, a large assembly of bishops determined this point." 
Accordingly, under Agrippinus, at any rate, the thing was new.  But I
cannot understand what Cyprian means by saying, "And thenceforward to
the present day, so many thousand heretics in our provinces, having been
converted to our Church, showed no hesitation or dislike, but rather
with full consent of reason and will, have embraced the opportunity of
the grace of the laver of life and the baptism unto salvation," <span
id="fr_1284"></span>[1285](#fn_1284) unless indeed he says,
"thenceforward to the present day," because from the time when they were
baptized in the Church, in accordance with the Council of Agrippinus, no
question of excommunication had arisen in the case of any of the
rebaptized.  Yet if the custom of baptizing those who came over from
heretics remained in force from the time of Agrippinus to that of
Cyprian, why should new Councils have been held by Cyprian on this
point?  Why does he say to this same Jubaianus that he is not doing
anything new or sudden, but only what had been established by
Agrippinus?  For why should Jubaianus be disturbed by the question of
novelty, so as to require to be satisfied by the authority of
Agrippinus, if this was the continuous practice of the Church from
Agrippinus till Cyprian?  Why, lastly, did so many of his colleagues
urge that reason and truth must be preferred to custom, instead of
saying that those who wished to act otherwise were acting contrary to
truth and custom alike?
