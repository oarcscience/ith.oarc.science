<span id="v.v.iv.ciii"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv.ciii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.ciii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 103.—</span>234.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.ciii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"Imitate indeed the prophets, who feared to have their holy souls
deceived with false baptism.  For Jeremiah says of old that among
impious men water is as one that lies.  ‘Water,’ he says, ‘that lies has
not faith.’"

<span id="v.v.iv.ciii-p2"></span>235.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.ciii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  Any one that
hears these words, without being acquainted with the Scriptures, and who
does not believe that you are either so far astray as not to know what
you are saying, or deceiving in such wise that he whom you have deceived
should not know what he says, would believe that the prophet Jeremiah,
wishing to be baptized, had taken precautions not to be baptized by
impious men, and had used these words with this intent.  For what was
your object in saying, previous to your quotation of this passage,
"Imitate indeed the prophets, who feared to have their holy souls
deceived with false baptism?"  Just as though, in the days of Jeremiah,
any one were washed with the sacrament of baptism, except so far as the
Pharisees almost every moment bathed themselves, and their couches and
cups and platters, with the washings which the Lord condemned, as we
read in the gospel. <span id="fr_2281"></span>[2282](#fn_2281)   How
then could Jeremiah have said this, as though he desired to be baptized,
and sought to avoid being baptized by impious men?  He said it, then,
when he was complaining of a faithless people, by the corruption of
whose morals he was vexed, not wishing to associate with their deeds;
and yet he did not separate himself bodily from their congregation, nor
seek other sacraments than those which the people received as suitable
to that time, according to the law of Moses.  To this people, therefore,
in their evil mode of life, he gave the name of "a wound," with which
the heart of the righteous man was grievously smitten, whether speaking
thus of himself, or foreshadowing in himself what he foresaw would come
to pass.  For he speaks as follows:  "O Lord, remember me, and visit me;
make clear my innocence before those who persecute me in no spirit of
long-suffering:  know that for Thy sake I have suffered rebuke from
those that scorn Thy words.  Make their portion complete; and Thy word
shall be unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart:  for I am called
by Thy name, O Lord God of hosts.  I sat not in the assembly of the
mockers, but was afraid of the presence of Thy hand; I sat alone,
because I was filled with bitterness.  Why do those who make me sad
prevail against me?  My wound is grievous; whence shall I be healed?  It
is become unto me as lying water, that has no faith." <span
id="fr_2282"></span>[2283](#fn_2282)   In all this it is manifest what
the prophet wished to be understood, but manifest only to those who do
not wish to distort to their own perverse cause the meaning of what they
read.  For Jeremiah says that his wound has become unto him as lying
water, which cannot inspire faith; but he wished that by his wound those
should be understood who made him sad by the evil conduct of their
lives.  Whence also the apostle says, "Without were fightings, within
were fears;"  <span id="fr_2283"></span>[2284](#fn_2283) and again, "Who
is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?" <span
id="fr_2284"></span>[2285](#fn_2284)   And because he had no hopes that
they could be reformed, therefore he said, "Whence shall I be healed?"
as though his own pain must needs continue so long as those among whom
he was compelled to live continued what they were.  But that a people is
commonly understood under the appellation of water is shown in the
Apocalypse, where we understand "many waters" to mean "many peoples,"
not by any conjecture of our own, but by an express explanation in the
place itself.  <span id="fr_2285"></span>[2286](#fn_2285)   Abstain then
from blaspheming the sacrament of baptism from any misunderstanding, or
rather error, even when found in a man of most abandoned character; for
not even in the lying Simon was the baptism which he received a lying
water, <span id="fr_2286"></span>[2287](#fn_2286) nor do all the liars
of your party administer a lying water when they <span id="page_591">p.
591</span> <span id="v.v.iv.ciii-Page_591"></span>baptize in the name of
the Trinity.  For neither do they begin to be liars only when they are
betrayed and convicted, and so forced to acknowledge their misdeeds; but
rather they were already liars, when, being adulterers and accursed,
they pretended to be chaste and innocent.
