<p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.xcviii-p3"></A>224.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xcviii-p3.1"></A>Augustin</span> answered:&#160; We put no confidence in man, but, so far as we can, we warn men to place their trust in the Lord; nor do we put confidence in princes, but, so far as we can, we warn princes to put confidence in the Lord.&#160; And though we may seek aid from princes to promote the advantage of the Church, yet do we not put confidence in them.&#160; For neither did the apostle himself put confidence in that tribune, in the sense in which   the Psalmist talks of putting confidence in princes, from whom he obtained for himself that an escort of armed men should be assigned to him; nor did he put confidence in the armed men, by whose protection he escaped the snares of the wicked ones, in any such sense as that of the Psalmist where he speaks of putting confidence in men.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2264"></A><A HREF="#fn_2264"><FONT SIZE="1">2265</FONT></A>
&#160; But neither do we find fault with you yourselves, because you sought from the emperor that the basilicas should be restored to you, as though you had put your trust in Julian the prince; but we find fault with you, that you have despaired of the witness of Christ, from whose unity you have separated the basilicas themselves.&#160; For you received them at the bidding of an enemy of Christ, that in them you should despise the commands of Christ, whilst you find force and truth   in what Julian ordained, saying, "This, moreover, on the petition of Rogatianus, Pontius, Cassianus, and other bishops, not without an intermixture of clergy, is added to complete the whole, that those proceedings which were taken to their prejudice wrongly and without authority being all annulled, everything should be restored to its former position;" and yet you find nothing that has either force or truth in what Christ ordained, saying, "Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and   in all Judea, and in Samaria, and even in the whole earth."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2265"></A><A HREF="#fn_2265"><FONT SIZE="1">2266</FONT></A>
&#160; <A NAME="page_587"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 587</FONT></A> <a name="v.v.iv.xcviii-Page_587"></A>We entreat you, let yourselves be reformed.&#160; Return to this most manifest unity of the whole world; and let all things be restored to their former position, not in accordance with the words of the apostate Julian, but in accordance with the words of our Saviour Christ.&#160; Have pity on your own soul.&#160; We are not now comparing Constantine and Julian in order to show how different they are.&#160; We are not saying, If you have not placed confidence in a man and   in a prince, when you said to a pagan and apostate emperor, that "in him justice only found a place," seeing that the party of Donatus has universally employed the prayers and the rescript in which those words occur, as is proved by the records of the audience; much less ought we to be accused by you, as though we put our confidence in any man or prince, if without any blasphemous flattery we obtained any request from Constantine or from the other Christian emperors; or if they themselves,   without our asking for it, but remembering the account which they shall render to the Lord, under whose words they tremble when they hear what you yourself have quoted, "Be wise now therefore, O ye kings," etc., and many other sayings of the sort, make any ordinance of their own accord in support of the unity of the Catholic Church.&#160; But I say nothing about Constantine.&#160; It is Christ and Julian that we contrast before you; nay, more than this, it is God and man, the Son of God and the son of   hell, the Saviour of our souls and the destroyer of his own.&#160; Why do you maintain the rescript of Julian in the occupation of the basilicas, and yet not maintain the gospel of Christ in embracing the peace of the Church?&#160; We too cry out, "Let all things that have been done amiss be restored to their ancient condition."&#160; The gospel of Christ is of greater antiquity than the rescript of Julian; the unity of Christ is of greater antiquity than the party of Donatus; the prayers of the Church to the   Lord on behalf of the unity of the Church are of greater antiquity than the prayers of Rogatianus, and Pontius, and Cassianus, to Julian on behalf of the party of Donatus.&#160; Are proceedings wrongly taken when kings forbid division? and are they not wrongly taken when bishops divide unity?&#160; Is that wrong action when kings minister to the witness of Christ in defence of the Church? and is it not wrong action when bishops contradict the witness of Christ in order to deny the Church?&#160; We entreat   you, therefore, that the words of Julian himself, to whom you thus made supplication, may be listened to, not in opposition to the gospel, but in accordance with the gospel, and that "all things which have been done amiss may be restored to their former condition."</p>
