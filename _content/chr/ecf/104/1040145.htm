<p class="c10"><a name="iv.viii.xliv-p2"></A>49.&#160; And as this vision is greatly hindered by those fancies which are originated by the carnal sense, and are retained and modified by the imagination, let us abhor this heresy which has been led by faith in its fancies to represent the divine substance as extended and diffused through space, even through infinite space, and to cut short one side so as to make room for evil,&#8212;not being able to perceive that evil is not nature, but against nature; and to beautify this very evil with such visible appearance, and forms, and consistency of parts prevailing in its several natures, not being able to conceive of any nature without those good things, that the evils found fault with in it are buried under a countless abundance of good things.</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.viii.xliv-p3"></A>Here let us close this part of the treatise.&#160; The other absurdities of Manich&aelig;us will be exposed in what follows, by the permission and help of God.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_294"></A><A HREF="#fn_294"><FONT SIZE="1">295</FONT></A>
