<p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.viii.ii-p3"></A>4.&#160; Therefore, in discussing the opinion of Cyprian, though myself of far inferior merit to Cyprian, I say that good and bad alike can have, can give, can receive the sacrament of baptism,&#8212;the good, indeed, to their health and profit; the bad to their destruction and ruin,&#8212;while the sacrament itself is of equal perfectness in both of them; and that it is of no consequence to its equal perfectness in all, how much worse the man may be that has it among the bad, just as   it makes no difference how much better he may be that has it among the good.&#160; And accordingly it makes no difference either how much worse he may be that confers it, as it makes no difference how much better he may be; and so it makes no difference how much worse he may be that receives it, as it makes no difference how much better he may be.&#160; For the sacrament is equally holy, in virtue of its own excellence, both in those who are unequally just, and in those who are unequally unjust.</p>
