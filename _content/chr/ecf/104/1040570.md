said:  "If then there are not some to whom all this power of faith is
found to be in opposition, on what principle do you persecute, so as to
compel men to defile themselves:?"

<span id="v.v.iv.lxxxiii-p2"></span>182.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxxxiii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  We neither
persecute you, except so far as truth persecutes falsehood; nor has it
anything to do with us if any one has persecuted you in other ways, just
as it has nothing to do with you if any of your party do likewise; nor
do we compel you to defile yourselves, but we persuade you to be cured.
