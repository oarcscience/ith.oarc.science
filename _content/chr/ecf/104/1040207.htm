<p class="c38"><a name="iv.x.xxv-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="iv.x.xxv-p1.1"></A>Chapter 23.&#8212;Whence a Bad Measure, a Bad Form, a Bad Order May Sometimes Be Spoken of.</span></p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.xxv-p2"></A>Therefore a bad measure, a bad form, a bad order, are either so called because they are less than they should be, or because they are not adapted to those things to which they should be adapted; so that they may be called bad as being alien and incongruous; as if any one should be said not to have done in a good measure because he has done less than he ought, or because he has done in such a thing as he ought not to have done, or more than was fitting, or not conveniently; so that the very fact of that being reprehended which is done in a bad measure, is justly reprehended for no other cause than that the measure is not there maintained.&#160; Likewise a form is called bad either in comparison with something more handsome or more beautiful, this form being less, that greater, not in size but <A NAME="page_356"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 356</FONT></A> <a name="iv.x.xxv-Page_356"></A>in comeliness; or because it is out of harmony with the thing to which it is applied, so that it seems alien and unsuitable.&#160; As if a man should walk forth into a public place naked, which nakedness does not offend if seen in a bath.&#160; Likewise also order is called bad when order itself is maintained in an inferior degree.&#160; Hence not order, but rather disorder, is bad; since either the ordering is less than it should be, or not as it should be.&#160; Yet where there is any measure, any form, any order, there is some good and some nature; but where there is no measure, no form, no order, there is no good, no nature.</p>
