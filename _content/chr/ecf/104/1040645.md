<span id="v.v.v.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 48.—</span>58.  When we ask,
therefore, by what means the man is to be cleansed whom you do not
baptize again in your communion, even when it has been made clear that
he has been baptized by some one who, on account of some concealed
iniquity, did not at the time possess the conscience of one that gives
in holiness, what answer do you intend to make, except that he is
cleansed by Christ or by God, although, indeed, Christ is Himself God
over all, blessed for ever, <span id="fr_2419"></span>[2420](#fn_2419)
or by the Holy Spirit since He too is Himself God, because this Trinity
of Persons is one God?  Whence Peter, after saying to a man, "Thou hast
dared to lie to the Holy Ghost," immediately went on to add what was the
nature of the Holy Ghost, saying, "Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto
God." <span id="fr_2420"></span>[2421](#fn_2420)   Lastly, even if you
were to say that he was cleansed and purified by an angel when he is
unacquainted with the pollution in the conscience of him that gives but
not in holiness, take notice that it is said of the saints, when they
shall have risen to eternal life, that they shall then be equal to the
angels of God. <span id="fr_2421"></span>[2422](#fn_2421)   Any one,
therefore, that is cleansed even by an angel is cleansed with greater
holiness than if he were cleansed by any kind of conscience of man.  Why
then are you unwilling that it should be said to you, If cleaning is
wrought by the hands of a man when he is genuinely and manifestly good;
but when the man is evil, but undetected in his wickedness, then since
he has not the conscience of one that <span id="page_621">p. 621</span>
<span id="v.v.v.xlviii-Page_621"></span>gives in holiness, it is no
longer he, but God, or an angel, that cleanses; therefore they who are
baptized by undetected evil men are justified with greater holiness than
those who are baptized by men that are genuinely and manifestly good? 
And if this opinion is displeasing to you, as in reality it ought to be
displeasing to every one, then take away the source from which it
springs, correct the premiss to which it is indissolubly bound; for if
these do not precede as hypotheses, the other will not follow as a
consequence.
