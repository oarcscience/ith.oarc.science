<p class="c41"><a name="v.iv.iv.i-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.iv.i-p1.1"></A>Chapter 1.&#8212;</span>1.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.iv.i-p1.2"></A>How</span> much the arguments make for us, that is, for catholic peace, which the party of Donatus profess to bring forward against us from the authority of the blessed Cyprian, and how much they prove against those who bring them forward, it is my intention, with the help of God, to show in the ensuing book.&#160; If, therefore, in the course of my argument, I am obliged to repeat what I have already said in   other treatises (although I will do so as little as I can,) yet this ought not to be objected to by those who have already read them and agree with them; since it is not only right that those things which are necessary for instruction should be frequently instilled into men of dull intelligence, but even in the case of those who are endowed with larger understanding, it contributes very much both to make their learning easier and their powers of teaching readier, where the same points are   handled and discussed in many various ways.&#160; For I know how much it discourages a reader, when he comes upon any knotty question in the book which he has in hand, to find himself presently referred for its solution to another which he happens not to have.&#160; Wherefore, if I am compelled, by the urgency of the present questions, to repeat what I have already said in other books, I would seek forgiveness from those who know those books already, that those who are ignorant may have their   difficulties removed; for it is better to give to one who has already, than to abstain from satisfying any one who is in want.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.iv.i-p2"></A>&#160;2.&#160; What, then, do they venture to say, when their mouth is closed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1208"></A><A HREF="#fn_1208"><FONT SIZE="1">1209</FONT></A>
 by the force of truth, with which they will not agree?&#160; "Cyprian," say they, "whose great merits and vast learning we all know, decreed in a Council,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1209"></A><A HREF="#fn_1209"><FONT SIZE="1">1210</FONT></A>
 with many of his fellow-bishops contributing their several opinions, that all heretics and schismatics, that is, all who are severed from the communion of the one Church, are without baptism; and therefore, whosoever has joined the communion of the Church after being baptized by them must be baptized in the Church."&#160; The authority of Cyprian does not alarm me, because I am reassured by his humility.&#160; We know, indeed, the great merit of the bishop and martyr Cyprian; but is   it in any way greater than that of the apostle and martyr Peter, of whom the said Cyprian speaks as follows in his epistle to Quintus?&#160; "For neither did Peter, whom the Lord chose first, and on whom He built His Church,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1210"></A><A HREF="#fn_1210"><FONT SIZE="1">1211</FONT></A>
 when Paul afterwards disputed with him about circumcision, claim or assume anything insolently and arrogantly to himself, so as to say that he held the primacy, and should rather be obeyed of those who were late and newly come.&#160; Nor did he despise Paul because he had before been a persecutor of the Church, but he admitted the counsel of truth, and readily assented to the legitimate grounds which Paul maintained; giving us thereby a pattern of concord and patience,   <A NAME="page_426"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 426</FONT></A> <a name="v.iv.iv.i-Page_426"></A>that we should not pertinaciously love our own opinions, but should rather account as our own any true and rightful suggestions of our brethren and colleagues for the common health and weal."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1211"></A><A HREF="#fn_1211"><FONT SIZE="1">1212</FONT></A>
&#160; Here is a passage in which Cyprian records what we also learn in holy Scripture, that the Apostle Peter, in whom the primacy of the apostles shines with such exceeding grace, was corrected by the later Apostle Paul, when he adopted a custom in the matter of circumcision at variance with the demands of truth.&#160; If it was therefore possible for Peter in some point to walk not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, so as to compel the Gentiles to judaize, as Paul   writes in that epistle in which he calls God to witness that he does not lie; for he says, "Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1212"></A><A HREF="#fn_1212"><FONT SIZE="1">1213</FONT></A>
 and, after this sacred and awful calling of God to witness, he told the whole tale, saying in the course of it, "But when I saw that they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1213"></A><A HREF="#fn_1213"><FONT SIZE="1">1214</FONT></A>
&#8212;if Peter, I say, could compel the Gentiles to live after the manner of the Jews, contrary to the rule of truth which the Church afterwards held, why might not Cyprian, in opposition to the rule of faith which the whole Church afterwards held, compel heretics and schismatics to be baptized afresh?&#160; I suppose that there is no slight to Cyprian in comparing him with Peter in respect to his crown of martyrdom; rather I ought to be afraid lest I am showing disrespect towards   Peter.&#160; For who can be ignorant that the primacy of his apostleship is to be preferred to any episcopate whatever?&#160; But, granting the difference in the dignity of their sees, yet they have the same glory in their martyrdom.&#160; And whether it may be the case that the hearts of those who confess and die for the true faith in the unity of charity take precedence of each other in different points, the Lord Himself will know, by the hidden and wondrous dispensation of whose grace the thief hanging on   the cross once for all confesses Him, and is sent on the selfsame day to paradise,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1214"></A><A HREF="#fn_1214"><FONT SIZE="1">1215</FONT></A>
 while Peter, the follower of our Lord, denies Him thrice, and has his crown postponed:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1215"></A><A HREF="#fn_1215"><FONT SIZE="1">1216</FONT></A>
&#160; for us it were rash to form a judgment from the evidence.&#160; But if any one were now found compelling a man to be circumcised after the Jewish fashion, as a necessary preliminary for baptism, this would meet with much more general repudiation by mankind, than if a man should be compelled to be baptized again.&#160; Wherefore, if Peter, on doing this, is corrected by his later colleague Paul, and is yet preserved by the bond of peace and unity till he is promoted to martyrdom,   how much more readily and constantly should we prefer, either to the authority of a single bishop, or to the Council of a single province, the rule that has been established by the statutes of the universal Church?&#160; For this same Cyprian, in urging his view of the question, was still anxious to remain in the unity of peace even with those who differed from him on this point, as is shown by his own opening address at the beginning of the very Council which is quoted by the Donatists.&#160; For it is   as follows:</p>
