<p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.viii-p2"></A>But if corruption take away all measure, all form, all order from corruptible things, no nature will remain.&#160; And consequently every nature which cannot be corrupted is the highest good, as is God.&#160; But every nature that can be corrupted is also itself some good; for corruption cannot injure it, except by taking away from or diminishing that which is good.</p>
