<span id="v.iv.iv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.</span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xiv-p1.2"></span>—</span>19.  But which is the worse, not to
be baptized at all, or to be twice baptized, it is difficult to decide. 
I see, indeed, which is more repugnant and abhorrent to men’s feelings;
but when I have recourse to that divine balance, in which the weight of
things is determined, not by man’s feelings, but by the authority of
God, I find a statement by our Lord on either side.   For He said to
Peter, "He who is washed has no need of washing a second time;" <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[1261](#fn_1260) and to Nicodemus, "Except a man be
born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God." <span id="fr_1261"></span>[1262](#fn_1261)   What is the purport
of the more secret determination of God, it is perhaps difficult for men
like us to learn; but as far as the mere words are concerned, any one
may see what a difference there is between "has no need of washing," and
"cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven."  The Church, lastly, herself
holds as her tradition, that without baptism she cannot admit a man to
her altar at all; but since it is allowed that one who has been
rebaptized may be admitted after penance, surely this plainly proves
that his baptism is considered valid.  If, therefore, Cyprian thought
that those whom he considered to be unbaptized yet had some share in
pardon, in virtue of the bond of unity, the Lord has power to be
reconciled even to the rebaptized by means of the simple bond of unity
and peace, and by this same compensating power of peace to mitigate His
displeasure against those by whom they were rebaptized, and to pardon
all the errors which they had committed while in error, on their
offering the sacrifice of charity, which covereth the multitude of sins;
so that He looks not to the number of those who have been wounded by
their separation, but to the greater number who have been delivered from
bondage by their return.  For in the same bond of peace in which Cyprian
conceived that, through the mercy of God, those whom he considered to
have been admitted to the Church without baptism, were yet not severed
from the gifts of the Church, we also believe that through the same
mercy of God the rebaptized can earn their pardon at His hands.
