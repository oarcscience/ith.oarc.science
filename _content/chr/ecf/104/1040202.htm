<p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.xx-p2"></A>For neither is that material, which the ancients called <i>Hyle</i>, to be called an evil.&#160; I do not say that which Manich&aelig;us with most senseless vanity, not knowing what he says, denominates <i>Hyle</i>, namely, the former of corporeal beings; whence it is rightly said to him, that he introduces another god.&#160; For nobody can form and create corporeal beings but God alone; for neither are they created unless there subsist with them measure, form, and order, which I think that now even they themselves confess to be good things, and things that cannot be except from God.&#160; But by <i>Hyle</i> I mean a certain material absolutely formless and without quality, whence those qualities that we perceive are formed, as the ancients said.&#160; For hence also wood is called in Greek <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.x.xx-p2.1"></A> &#8021;&#955;&#951;</span>, because it is adapted to workmen, not that itself may make anything, but that it is the material of which something may be made.&#160; Nor is that <i> Hyle</i>, therefore, to be called an evil which cannot be perceived through any appearance, but can scarcely be thought of through any sort of privation of appearance.&#160; For this has also a capacity of forms; for if it cannot receive the form imposed by the workman, neither assuredly may it be called material.&#160; Hence if form is some good, whence those who excel in it are called beautiful,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1087"></A><A HREF="#fn_1087"><FONT SIZE="1">1088</FONT></A>
 as from appearance they are called handsome,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1088"></A><A HREF="#fn_1088"><FONT SIZE="1">1089</FONT></A>
 even the capacity of form is undoubtedly something good.&#160; As because wisdom is a good, no one doubts that to be capable of wisdom is a good.&#160; And because every good is from God, no one ought to doubt that even matter, if there is any, has its existence from God alone.</p>
