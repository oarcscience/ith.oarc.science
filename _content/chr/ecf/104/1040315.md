<span id="v.iv.vi.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—</span>25.  "Can the power of
baptism," says Cyprian, "be greater or better than confession? than
martyrdom? that a man should confess Christ before men, and be baptized
in his own blood?  And yet," he goes on to say, "neither does this
baptism profit the heretic, even though for confessing Christ he be put
to death outside the Church." <span id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440)
  This is most true; for, by being put to death outside the Church, he
is proved not to have had charity, of which the apostle says, "Though I
give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me
nothing." <span id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441)   But if martyrdom
is of no avail for this reason, because it has not charity, neither does
it profit those who, as Paul says, and Cyprian further sets forth, are
living within the Church without charity in envy and malice; and yet
they can both receive and transmit true baptism.  "Salvation," he says,
"is not without the Church." <span id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442)
  Who says that it is?  And therefore, whatever men have that belongs to
the Church, it profits them nothing towards salvation outside the
Church.  But it is one thing not to have, another to have so as to be of
no use.  He who has not must be baptized that he may have; but he who
has to no avail must be corrected, that what he has may profit him.  Nor
is the water in the baptism of heretics "adulterous," <span
id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443) because neither is the creature
itself which God made evil, nor is fault to be found with the words of
the gospel in the mouths of any who are astray; but the fault is theirs
in whom there is an adulterous spirit, even though it may receive the
adornment of the sacrament from a lawful spouse.  Baptism therefore can
"be common to us, and the heretics," <span
id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444) just as the gospel can be common to
us, whatever difference there may be between our faith and their
error,—whether they think otherwise than the truth about the Father, or
the Son, or the Holy Spirit; or, being cut away from unity, do not
gather with Christ, but scatter abroad, <span
id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445) —seeing that the sacrament of
baptism can be common to us, if we are the wheat of the Lord, with the
covetous within the Church, and with robbers, and drunkards, and other
pestilent persons of the same sort, of whom it is said, "They shall not
inherit the kingdom of God," <span id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446)
and yet the vices by which they are separated from the kingdom of God
are not shared by us.
