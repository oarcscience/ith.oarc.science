<span id="v.v.iv.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—</span>60.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xxvi-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"For if you mix what is false with what is true, falsehood often
imitates the truth by treading in its steps.  Just in the same way a
picture imitates the true man of nature, depicting with its colors the
false resemblance of truth.  And in the same way, too, the brilliancy of
a mirror catches the countenance, so as to represent the eyes of him who
gazes on it.  In this way it presents to each comer his own countenance,
so that the very features of the comer meet themselves in turn; and of
such virtue is the falsehood of a clear mirror, that the very eyes which
see themselves recognize themselves as though in some one else.  And
even when a shadow stands before it, it doubles the reflection, dividing
its unity in great part through a falsehood.  Must we then hold that
anything is true, because a lying representation is given of it?  But it
is one thing to paint a man, another to give birth to one.  For does any
one represent fictitious children to a man who wishes for an heir? or
would any one look for true heirs in the falsehood of a picture?  Truly
it is a proof of madness to fall in love with a picture, letting go
one’s hold of what is true."

<span id="v.v.iv.xxvi-p2"></span>61.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxvi-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  Are you then
really not ashamed to call the baptism of Christ a lie, even when it is
found in the most false of men?  Far be it from any one to suppose that
the wheat of the Lord, which has been commanded to grow among the tares
throughout the whole field, that is, throughout the whole of this world,
until the harvest, that is, until the end of the world, <span
id="fr_2055"></span>[2056](#fn_2055) can have perished in consequence of
your evil words.  Nay, even among the very tares themselves, which are
commanded not to be gathered, but to be tolerated even to the end, and
among the very chaff, which shall only be separated from the wheat by
the winnowing at the last day, <span
id="fr_2056"></span>[2057](#fn_2056) does any one dare to say that any
baptism is false which is given and received in <span id="page_546">p.
546</span> <span id="v.v.iv.xxvi-Page_546"></span>the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost?  Would you say that those
whom you depose from their office, whether as your colleagues or your
fellow-priests, on the testimony of women whom they have seduced (since
examples of this kind are not wanting anywhere), were false or true
before their crime was proved against them?  You will certainly answer,
False.  Why then were they able both to have and to give true baptism? 
Why did not their falseness as men corrupt in them the truth of God?  Is
it not most truly written, "For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee
deceit?" <span id="fr_2057"></span>[2058](#fn_2057)   Seeing then that
the Holy Spirit fled from them, how came it that the truth of baptism
was in them, except because what the Holy Spirit fled from was the
falseness of man, not the truth of the sacrament?  Further, if even the
deceitful have the true baptism, how do they have it who possess it in
truthfulness?  Whence you ought to observe that it is rather your
conversation which is colored with childish pigments; and accordingly,
he who neglects the living Word to take pleasure in such coloring is
himself loving the picture in the place of the reality.
