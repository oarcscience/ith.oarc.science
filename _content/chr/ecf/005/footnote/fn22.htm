<SUP>42 </SUP>The air of Sardinia was unwholesome, if not pestilential; and for this reason, no doubt, it was selected as a place of exile for martyrs. Hippolytus himself, along with the Roman bishop Pontianus, was banished thither. See introductory Notice. </P>

<SUP>43 </SUP>Marcia's connection with the emperor would not seem very consistent with the Christian character which Hippolytus ives her. Dr. Wordsworth supposes that Hippolytus speaks ironically in the case of Marcia, as well as of Hyacinthus and Carpophorus. [I do not see the evidence of this. Poor Marcia, afterwards poisoned by the wretch who de degradeded, was a heathen who under a little light was awakening to some sense of duty, like the woman of Samaria, John iv. 19.]</P>

<SUP>58 </SUP>This passage, of which there are different readings, has been variously interpreted. The rendering followed above does probably less violence to the text than others proposed. The variety of meaning generally turns on the word <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>enazia</FONT>in Miller's text. Bunsen alters it into <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>en azia</FONT>... <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>hlikia</FONT>, i.e., were inflamed at a proper age. Dr. Wordsworth reads <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>hlikiwth</FONT>... <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>anaziw</FONT>, i.e., an unworthy comrade. Roeper reads <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>hlikia</FONT>... <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>anaziou</FONT>, i.e., in the bloom of youth were enamoured with one undeserving of their choice.</P>

<SUP>70 </SUP>See Josephus, <I>De Beil. Judaic</I>. ii. 8, from whom Hippolytus seems to have taken his account of the Jewish sects, except, as Schneidewin remarks, we suppose some other writer whom Josephus and Hippolytus themselves followed. The Abbe Cruice thinks that the author followed by Hippolytus was not Josephus, but a Christian writer ref the first century, who derived his materials from the Jewish historian. Hippolytus' text sometimes varies from the text of Josephus, as well as of Porphyry, who has taken excerpts from Josephus work.</P>
