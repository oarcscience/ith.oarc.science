<span id="P809_201079"></span> <sup>125</sup> The Abbe Cruice suggests
epipleon bwlou, which he thinks corresponds with the material of which
the pyramid mentioned in a previous chapter was composed. He, however,
makes no attempt at translating epipleon, Does he mean that the skull
was filled with clay? His emendation is forced.

<span id="P810_201460"></span> <sup>126</sup> Or, "rubbings of"
(Cruice).

<span id="P811_201596"></span> <sup>127</sup> Or, "they say."

<span id="P812_201785"></span> <sup>128</sup> Some similar juggleries
are mentioned by Lucian in his *Alexander*, or *Psendomantis*, xxxii.
26,-a work of a kindred nature to Celsus' *Treatise on Magic* (the
latter alluded to by Origen, *Contr. Cels*., lib. i p. 53 ed. Spenc.),
and dedicated by Lucian to Celsius.

<span id="P816_202539"></span> <sup>129</sup> The word magic, or
magician, at its origin, had no sinister meaning, as being the science
professed by the Magi, who were an exclusive religious sect of great
antiquity in Persia, universally venerated for their mathematical skill
and erudition generally. It was persons who practised wicked arts, and
assumed the name of Magi, that brought the term into disrepute. The
origin of magic has been ascribed fo Zoroaster, and once devised, it
made rapid progress; because, as Pliny reminds us, it includes three
systems of the greatest influence among men-(1) the art of medicine, (2)
religion, divination. This corresponds with Agrippa's division of magic
into (1) natural, (2) celestial, (3) ceremonial, or superstitious. This
last has been also called "goetic " (full of imposture), and relates to
the invocatioms of devils. This originated probably in Egypt, and
quickly spread all over the world.

<span id="P817_203922"></span> <sup>130</sup> Or, "topic discussed; "
or, "not leave any place (subterfuge) for these," etc.

*Metaphiysics*, book i.; Cicero, *De Natura Deorum*, book i. (both
translated in Bohn's (classical Library); and Plutarch, *De Placitis
Philosophorum*. lib. i.

<span id="P824_206625"></span> <sup>133</sup> The mention of the
Persians, Babylonians, and Egyptians shows the subject-matter of the
lost books to have been concerning the speculative systems of these
nations.

<span id="P825_207124"></span> <sup>134</sup> This rendering follows
Miller's text. Schneidewin thinks there is a hiatus, which the Abbe
Cruice fills up, the latter translating the passage without an
interrogation: "The Egyptians, who think themselves more ancient than
all, have formed their ideas of the power of the Deity by calculations
and computing," etc.

<span id="P826_207655"></span> <sup>135</sup> Or, "meditation on the
divine nature," or "godlike reflection."

<span id="P827_207876"></span> <sup>136</sup> The MS. has "says he."

<span id="P828_208730"></span> <sup>137</sup> The Abbe Cruice suggests
the elimination of 9, on account of its being a divisible number.

<span id="P830_208977"></span> <sup>138</sup> Miller considers some
reference here to the six days' creation (Hexaemeron), on account at the
word fusikwtera, i.e., more natural. The Abbe Cruice considers that
there is an allusion to an astronomic instrument used for exhibiting
harmonic combinations; see Ptolem., *Harmon*, i. 2. Bunsen reads tou
ecakuklou ulikou.

<span id="P831_209469"></span> <sup>139</sup> The text is obviously
corrupt. As given by Schneidewin, it might be rendered thus: "These
deriving from the monad a numerical symbol,a virtue, have progressed up
to the elements." He makes no attempt at a Latin version. The Abbe
Cruice would suggest tbe Introduction of the word prosteqsan, on account
of the statement already made, that "the monad, superadded into itself,
produces a duad."

<span id="P832_210959"></span> <sup>140</sup> There is a hiatus here.
Hippolytus has said nothing concerning enneads.

<span id="P836_212239"></span> <sup>141</sup> Or, "names have been
allocated," or "distributed."

<span id="P837_212402"></span> <sup>142</sup> Miller thinks it should be
"even number" ( peritton). The Abbe Cruice would retain "uneven" (
aperizugon), on the ground that the duad being a perizuc ariqmoj, the
monad will be aperizugoj.

<span id="P838_213145"></span> <sup>143</sup> Servius on the *Eclogues
of Virgil* (viii, 75) and Pliny ( *Hist. Nat*, xxxviii. 2) make similar
statements.

<span id="P839_213577"></span> <sup>144</sup> This is Miller and
Schneidewin's emendation for "uneven" in the MS.

i.e., bored the holes for the strings, or, in other words, constructed
the instrument. The Latin version in Buhle's edition of Aratus is *ad
cunam (cunabulam) compegit*, i.e., he fastened the strings into the
shell of the tortoise near his bed. The tortoise is mentioned by Aratus
in the first part of the line, which fact removes the obscurity of the
passage as quoted by Hippolytus. The general tradition corresponds with
this, in representing Mercury on the shores of the Nile forming a lyre
out of a dried tortoise. The word translated bed might be also rendered
fan, which was used as a cradle, its size and construction being
suitable. \[See note, p. 46, *infra*.\]

<span id="P875_224231"></span> <sup>154</sup> The Abbe Cruice considers
that these interpretations, as well as what follows, are taken not from
a Greek writer, but a Jewish heretic. No Greek, he supposes, would
write, as is stated lower down, that the Greeks were a Phoenician
colony. The Jewish heresies were impregnated by these silly doctrines
about the stars (see Epiphian., *Adv. Haeres*., lib. i. *De
Pharisaeis*).
