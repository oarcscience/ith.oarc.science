<SUP>7 </SUP>Miller refers us to Apostolius' <I>Proverb</I>., s.v. <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>yafwn</FONT>. Schneidewin remarks that Maximus Tyrius relates almost a similar story concerning one Psapho, a Libyan, in his <I>Dissert</I>.

<SUP>26 </SUP>In the <I>Recognitions of Clement</I>we have this passage: "He (Simon) wishes himself to be believed to be an exalted power, which is above God the Creator, and to be thought to be the Christ, and to be called the standing one" (Ante-Nicene Library, ed. Edinburgh. vol. iii. p. 196).</P>

<P><A NAME="P1475_415899"></A>
<SUP>27 </SUP>The expression <I>stan</I>(standinq) was used by the scholastic as applicable to the divine nature. Interpreted in this manner, the words in the text would be equivalent with "which was, and is, and is to come" (Rev. i. 8). The <I>Recognitions of Clement</I>explain the term thus: "He (Simon) use: this name as implying that he can never be dissolved, asserting that his flesh is so compacted by the power of his divinity, that it can endure to eternity. Hence, there-fore, he is called the <I>standing one</I>, as though he cannot fall by any corruption" (Ante-Nicene Library, vol. iii. p. 196).

<SUP>33 </SUP>Cruice omits the word <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>dedokhkenai</FONT>, which seems in interpolation. The above rendering adopts the proposed emendation.</P>

<P><A NAME="P1490_426598"></A>
<SUP>34 </SUP>Bunsen thinks that there is an allusion here to the conversation of our Lord with the woman of Samaria, and it' so, that Menander, a disciple of Simon, and not Simon himself, was the author of <I>The Great Announcement</I>, as the heretic did not outlive St. Peter and Paul, and therefore died before the period at which St John's Gospel was written.</P>

<P><A NAME="P1491_427827"></A>
<SUP>35 </SUP>Miller reads <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>fusin</FONT>, which makes no sense. The rendering above follows Bunsen's emendation of the text. [Here it is equally interesting to the student of our author or of Irenaeus to turn to Bunsen (p. 51), and to observe his parallels.] </P>

<P><A NAME="P1495_428932"></A>
<SUP>36 </SUP>The Abbe Cruice considers that the statements made by Origen (Iontr. Celsum, lib. i. p. 44, ed Spenc.), respecting the followers of Simon in respect of number, militates against Origen's authorship of <I>The Refutation</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="P1496_429388"></A>
<SUP>37 </SUP>This rendering follows the text of Schneidewin and Cruice. The <I>Clementine Recognitions</I>(Ante-Nicene Library, ed. Edinb., vol. iii. p. 273) represent Simon Magus as leaving for Rome, and St. Peter resolving to follow him thither. Miller's text is different and as emended by him, Hippolytus' account would harmonize with that given in the Acts. Miller's text may be thus translated: "And having been laid under a curse, as has been written in the Acts, he subsequently disapproved of his practices, and made an attempt to journey as far as Rome, but he fell in with the apostles," etc. The text or Cruice and Schneidewin seems less forced: while the statement itself-a new witness to this controverted point in ecclesiastical history concerning St. Peter-corroborates Hippolytus' authorship of <I>The Refutation</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="P1497_430649"></A>
<SUP>38 </SUP>Justin Martyr mentions, as an instance of the estimation in which Simon Magus was held among his followers, that a statue was erected to him at Rome. Bunsen considers that the refection of this fable of Justin Martyr's, point to the author of <I>The Refutation</I>being a Roman, who would therefore, as he shows himself in the case of the statue, be better informed than the Eastern writer of any event occurring in the capital of the West. [Bunsen's magisterial decision (p. 53) is very amusingly characteristic.] Hippolytus' silence is a presumption against the existence of such a statue, though it is very possible he might omit to mention it, supposing it to be at Rome. At all events, the jvery precise statement of Justin Martyr ought not to be rejected on slight or confectural grounds. [See vol. i., this series, pp. 171 ,172, 182, 187, and 193. But our author relies on Irenaeus, same vol., p. 348. Why reject positive testimony?] </P>
