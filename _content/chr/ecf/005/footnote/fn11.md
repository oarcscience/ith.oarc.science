literally means the rod; or, in later times, the comb fixed into the
iotoj(i.e., the upright loom), for the purpose of Driving the threads of
the woof home, thus making the web even and close. It is, among other
significations, applied to bones in the leg or arm. Cruice and
Schneidewin translate kerkij by sriha, a rendering adopted above. The
allusion is made again in chap. xii. and chap. xvi, In the last passage
kentron(spur) is used instead of kerkij.

<span id="P1127_301161"></span> <sup>138</sup> The text of this hymn is
very corrupt. The Abbe Cruice explains the connection of the hymn with
the foregoing exposition, and considers it to have a reference to the
Metempsychosis, which forms part of the system of the Naasseni.

<span id="P1131_301541"></span> <sup>139</sup> Or, "nimble."

<span id="P1158_303156"></span> <sup>140</sup> Something is wanting
after Perpatikh in the text. Miller supplies the deficiency, and his
conjecture is adopted above. Literally, it should be rendered -" the
Peratic heresy, the blasphemy of which (heretics)," etc.

<span id="P1159_303415"></span> <sup>141</sup> Most of what is mentioned
by Hippolytus concerning this sect is new, as the chief writers on the
early heresies are comparatively silent concerning the Peratae; indeed,
Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Epiphanius completely so. Clemens
Alexandrinus, *Strom*., vii.; (vol. ii. p. 555), mentions the Peratics,
and Theodoret more fully than the rest speaks of them (
*Haerer.fabul*.,i. 17). Theodoret, however, as the Abbe Cruice thinks,
has appropriated his remarks from Hippolytus.

<span id="P1160_304394"></span> <sup>142</sup> proecester or
prosexestera, contiguous. This is Miller's reading, but is devoid of
sense. Proecestera, adopted by Schneidewin and Cruice, might bear the
meaning of the expression par par excellence.

<span id="P1161_304796"></span> <sup>143</sup> grgrnnhmenwn: Miller
reads gegennhmenon, agreeing with plhqos. Bernays, in his *Epistola
Critica* addressed to Bunsen, proposes the former reading.

<span id="P1162_304995"></span> <sup>144</sup> eidikor: some read
idikor. This term, adopted from the Platonic philosophy, is translated
*specialis* by logicians, and *transcendentalis* by metaphysicians. It
expresses the pre-existent form in the divine mind, according to which
material objects were fashioned. The term seems out of place as used by
the Peratics to denominate a corruptible and perishing world. We should
rather expect rlikou, i.e, material. (See Aristotle's masterly
exposition of the subject of the eidoj and ulh in his *Metaphysics* book
vi., and p. 64 of the analysis prefixed to the translation in Bohn's
Library.)

<span id="P1166_307328"></span> <sup>147</sup> afietai: some read afiei,
i.e., dismisses; some afiei eikh, i.e., heedlessly casts off.
Hippolytus, in his *Summary of the Peratic*Heresy in book x., has
afietai eikh, which Cruice translates *temere*absolvuntur. Schneidewin
has in the same passage afietal merely, and translates it
*abjiciuintur*. In both places Bernays suggests ofioeioh, i.e., those of
the nature of the Serpent.

<span id="P1175_312348"></span> <sup>151</sup> Celles, as observed in a
former note, has two other forms in *The Retutation*, viz., Acembes and
Ademes. He is called Carystius, and the other founder of the heresy
Peraticus. As the latter term is frequently used to designate Eubaea,
i.e., the country beyond ( peran) the continent, it is inferred that
Carystius has a simlar import. This would seem placed beyond conjecture
by a passage ( *Strom*., vii, vol. ii. p. 555) in Clemens Alexandrinus,
already alluded to, who says that some heresies, e.g., those of the
Marcionites and Basilidians, derived their denomination from the names,
whereas others from the country, of their founders. As an instance of
the latter, he mentions the Peratics (see note 4, p. 62, \[and note 6,
p. 58\]).

<span id="P1176_313869"></span> <sup>152</sup> Some deficiencies in the

requires to have the ellipsis supplied as above. It may be freely
rendered "nay more." Miller reads Allh gar i.e. "There is some other
difference," etc.; but this does not agree with Sextus Empiricus.

<span id="P1179_314743"></span> <sup>155</sup> Or, "sympathy:" sumpaoeia
is, however, properly altered into asumpaoeia on the authority of
Sextus.

<span id="P1181_315349"></span> <sup>156</sup> i.e., "Rulers of
localities and suburbans."

<span id="P1182_315888"></span> <sup>157</sup> The Peratic heresy both
Hippolytus and Theodoret state to have originated from Euphrates.
Origen, on the other hand, states ( *Contr. Cels*., vi. 28, \[vol. iv.
p. F86\]) that Euphrates was founder of the Ophites. The inference from
this is, that Origen was not author of The *Refutation.*

<span id="P1186_316496"></span> <sup>158</sup> Hippolytus at the end of
this chapter mentions the title of one of their books, Oi proasteio ewj
aiqeroj, "The Suburbans up to the Air." Bunsen suggests Peratai ewj
aiqeroj, "The Transcendental Etherians." (See note 1 *supra*.)

<span id="P1187_316784"></span> <sup>159</sup> The Abbe Cruice considers
that the following system of cosmogony is translated into Greek from
some Chaldaic or Syriac work. He recognises in it likewise a Jewish
element, to be accounted for from the fact that the Jews during the
Babylonish captivity imbibed the principles of the Oriental philosophy.
What, therefore, is given by Hippolytus may have a Judaistic origin.

<span id="P1188_317629"></span> <sup>160</sup> Schneidewin considers the
text here corrupt.

<span id="P1189_317846"></span> <sup>161</sup> The Abbe Cruice observes
that the reference here is to the second book of the law ( Ex. xv. 27),
where mention is made of the twelve fountains of Elim. The Hebrew word (

expression, as Cruice remarks, for closing the seal (See Job ix. 7.)

<span id="P1191_318555"></span> <sup>163</sup> Schneidewin refers us to
a passage from Berosus, who affirms that this person was styled Thalatta
by the Greeks, Thalath by the . Chaldeans.; another demonination being
Omorka, or Omoroka, or Marcaia. The Abbe Cruice, however, sets little
value on these names, which, following the judgment of Scaliger, he
pronounces spurious. It is unnecessary to remind scholars that the
authenticity of Berosus has collapsed under the attacks of modern
criticism.

<span id="P1192_319585"></span> <sup>164</sup> Miller suggests Xefelh,
Cruice Nebo.

<span id="P1193_319685"></span> <sup>165</sup> Cruicc thinks this may be
a figure of the year and of twelve months.
