<SUP>61 </SUP>1 John v. 8. [It is noteworthy that he quotes the Latin formula,and not that (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>eij to en eisin</FONT> ) of the Greek. Now, the Latin, repeating (in verse 8) the formula (hi tres unum sunt) which belongs to the dubious <I>protasis</I>, is so far evidence that such a verse existed in the old Greek. It is important that the Latin is not conformed to the received formula of the <I>apodosis</I>, " the three <I>agree</I> in one."] </P>
