##  Epistle XXVIII.<sup>[1](footnote/fn52.htm#P5215_1585575)</sup>

To the Presbyters and Deacons Abiding at Rome.

Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons abiding at Rome, his brethren,
greeting. Both our common love and the reason of the thing demand,
beloved brethren, that I should keep back from your knowledge nothing of
those matters which are transacted among us, that so we may have a
common plan for the advantage of the administration of the Church. For
after I wrote to you the letter which I sent by Saturus the reader, and
Optatus the sub-deacon, the combined temerity of certain of the lapsed,
who refuse to repent and to make satisfaction to God, wrote to me, not
asking that peace might be given to them, but claiming it as already
given; because they say that Paulus has given peace to all, as you will
read in their letter of which I have sent you a copy, as well as what I
briefly replied to them in the meantime. But that you may also know what
sort of a letter I afterwards wrote to the clergy, I have, moreover,
sent you a copy of this. But if, after all, their temerity should not be
repressed either by my letters or by yours, and should not yield to
wholesome counsels, I shall take such proceedings as the Lord, according
to His Gospel, has enjoined to be taken. I bid you, beloved brethren,
ever heartily farewell.
