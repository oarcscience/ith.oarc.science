##  Epistle XLII.<sup>[1](footnote/fn54.htm#P5448_1664389)</sup>

To the Same, on His Having Sent Letters to the Confessors Whom Novatian
Had Seduced.

Cyprian to Cornelius his brother, greeting. I have though it both
obligatory on me, and necessary for you, dearest brother, to write a
short letter to the confessors who are there with you, and, seduced by
the obstinacy and depravity of Novatian and
Novatus,<sup>[2](footnote/fn54.htm#P5453_1664920)</sup> have departed
from the Church; in which letter I might induce them, for the sake of
our mutual affection, to return to their Mother, that is, to the
Catholic Church. This letter I have first of all entrusted to you by
Mettius the sub-deacon for your perusal, lest any one should pretend
that I had written otherwise than according to the contents of my
letter. I have, moreover, charged the same Mettius sent by me to you,
that he should be guided by your decision; and if you should think that
this letter should be given to the confessors, then that he should
deliver it. I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.
