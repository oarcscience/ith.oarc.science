##  Epistle XVIII.

Caldonius to Cyprian.<sup>[1](footnote/fn50.htm#P5047_1532732)</sup>

Caldonius to Cyprian and his
fellow-presbyters<sup>[2](footnote/fn50.htm#P5051_1533041)</sup> abiding
at Carthage, greeting. The necessity of the times induces us not hastily
to grant peace. But it was well to write to you, that
they<sup>[3](footnote/fn50.htm#P5052_1533260)</sup> who, after having
sacrificed,<sup>[4](footnote/fn50.htm#P5053_1533361)</sup> were again
tried, became exiles. And thus they seem to me to have atoned for their
former crime, in that they now let go their possessions and homes, and,
repenting, follow Christ. Thus Felix, who assisted in the office of
presbyter<sup>[5](footnote/fn50.htm#P5054_1533638)</sup> under Decimus,
and was very near to me in bonds (I knew that same Felix very
thoroughly), Victoria, his wife, and Lucius, being faithful, were
banished, and have left their possessions, which the treasury now has in
keeping. Moreover, a woman, Bona by name, who was dragged by her husband
to sacrifice, and (with no conscience guilty of the crime, but because
those who held her hands, sacrificed) began to cry against them, "I did
not do it; you it was who did it!"-was also
banished.<sup>[6](footnote/fn50.htm#P5055_1534196)</sup> Since,
therefore, all these were asking for peace, saying, "We have recovered
the faith which we had lost, we have repented, and have publicly
confessed Christ"-although it seems to me that they ought to receive
peace,-yet I have referred them to your judgment, that I might not
appear to presume anything rashly. If, therefore, you should wish me to
do anything by the common decision, write to me. Greet our brethren; our
brethren greet you. I bid you, beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell.
