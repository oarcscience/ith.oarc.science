id="xxv.iii.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Letter LII</span>.—*First Letter to
Monks <span id="fr_4640"></span>[4641](#fn_4640) . (Written 358–360).*

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.vii-p3"></span>1. To those in every place <span
id="fr_4641"></span>[4642](#fn_4641) who are living a monastic life, who
are established in the faith of God, and sanctified in Christ, and who
say, ‘Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed Thee <span
id="fr_4642"></span>[4643](#fn_4642) ,’ brethren dearly beloved and
longed for, heartiest greeting in the Lord.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.vii-p6"></span>1. In compliance with your
affectionate request, which you have frequently urged upon me, I have
written a short account of the sufferings which ourselves and the Church
have undergone, refuting, according to my ability, the accursed heresy
of the Arian madmen, and proving how entirely it is alien from the
Truth. And I thought it needful to represent to your Piety what pains
the writing of these things has cost me, in order that you may
understand thereby how truly the blessed Apostle has said, ‘O the depth
of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God <span
id="fr_4643"></span>[4644](#fn_4643) ;’ and may kindly bear with a weak
man such as I am by nature. For the more I desired to write, and
endeavoured to force myself to understand the Divinity of the Word, so
much the more did the knowledge thereof withdraw itself from me; and in
proportion as I thought that I apprehended it, in so much I perceived
myself to fail of doing so. Moreover also I was unable to express in
writing even what I seemed to myself to understand; and that which I
wrote was unequal to the imperfect shadow of the truth which existed in
my conception.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.vii-p8"></span>2. Considering therefore how it is
written in the Book of Ecclesiastes, ‘I said, I will be wise, but it was
far from me; That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who shall find
it out <span id="fr_4644"></span>[4645](#fn_4644) ?’ and what is said in
the Psalms, ‘The knowledge of Thee is too wonderful for me; it is high,
I cannot attain unto it <span id="fr_4645"></span>[4646](#fn_4645) ;’
and that Solomon says, ‘It is the glory of God to conceal a thing <span
id="fr_4646"></span>[4647](#fn_4646) ;’ I frequently designed to stop
and to cease writing; believe me, I did. But lest I should be found to
disappoint you, or by my silence to lead into impiety those who have
made enquiry of you, and are given to disputation, I constrained myself
to write briefly, what I have now sent <span
id="fr_4647"></span>[4648](#fn_4647) to your piety. For although a
perfect apprehension of the truth is at present far removed from us by
reason of the infirmity of the flesh, yet it is possible, as the
Preacher himself has said, to perceive the madness of the impious, and
having found it, to say that it is ‘more bitter than death <span
id="fr_4648"></span>[4649](#fn_4648) .’ Wherefore for this reason, as
perceiving this and able to find it out, I have written, knowing that to
the faithful the detection of impiety is a sufficient information
wherein piety consists. For although it be impossible to comprehend what
God is, yet it is possible to say what He is not <span
id="fr_4649"></span>[4650](#fn_4649) . And we know that He is not as
man; and that it is not lawful to conceive of any originated nature as
existing in Him. So also respecting the Son of God, although we are by
nature very far from being able to comprehend Him; yet is it possible
and easy to condemn the assertions of the heretics concerning Him, and
to say, that the Son of God is not such; nor is it lawful even to
conceive in our minds such things as they speak, concerning His Godhead;
much less to utter them with the lips.

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.vii-p15"></span>3. Accordingly I have written as
well as I was able; and you, dearly beloved, receive these
communications not as containing a perfect exposition of the Godhead of
the Word, but as being merely a refutation of the impiety of the enemies
of Christ, and as containing and affording to those who desire it,
suggestions for arriving at a pious and sound faith in Christ. And if in
anything they are defective (and I think they are defective in all
respects), pardon it with a pure conscience, and only receive favourably
the boldness of my good intentions in support of godliness. For an utter
condemnation of the heresy of the Arians, it is sufficient for you to
know the judgment given by the Lord in the death of Arius, of which you
have already been informed by others. ‘For what the Holy God hath
purposed, who shall scatter <span id="fr_4650"></span>[4651](#fn_4650)
?’ and whom the Lord condemned who shall justify <span
id="fr_4651"></span>[4652](#fn_4651) ? After such a sign given, who do
not now acknowledge, that the heresy is hated of God, however it may
have men for its patrons? Now when you have read this account, pray for
me, and exhort one another so to do. And immediately send it back to me,
and suffer no one whatever to take a copy of it, nor transcribe it for
yourselves <span id="fr_4652"></span>[4653](#fn_4652) . But like <span
id="page_564">p. 564</span> <span
id="xxv.iii.iv.vii-Page_564"></span>good money-changers <span
id="fr_4653"></span>[4654](#fn_4653) be satisfied with the reading; but
read it repeatedly if you desire to do so. For it is not safe that the
writings of us babblers and private persons should fall into the hands
of them that shall come after. Salute one another in love, and also all
that come unto you in piety and faith. For ‘if any man’ as the Apostle
has said, ‘love not the Lord, let him be anathema. The grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ be with you <span id="fr_4654"></span>[4655](#fn_4654) .
Amen.’

<span id="xxv.iii.iv.vii-p2"></span> This beautiful and striking Letter
(Migne xxv. 691) formed the introduction to a work, which the Author, as
he says in the course of it, thought unworthy of being preserved for
posterity. Some critics have supposed it to be the Orations against the
Arians; but this opinion can hardly be maintained (*supr.* p. 267). The
Epistle was written in 358, or later, before the Epistle to Serapion. On
its relation to the ‘Arian History,’ see above, pp. 267, 268.

Nature is, that it is *not* to be known; and whatever positive
statements we make concerning God, relate not to His Nature, but to the
accompaniments of His Nature.’ Damasc. *F.O.* i. 4; S. Basil *c. Eunom.*
