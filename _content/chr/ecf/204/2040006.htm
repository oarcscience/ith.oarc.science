<p class="c11"><a name="v.i.i-p5"></A>&sect;1. <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.1"></A>Editions</span>, &amp;c. (A) Before 1601 only Latin translations. The first, at <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.2"></A>Vicenza</span>, 1482, completed by Barnabas Celsanus after the death of the translator <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.3"></A>Omnibonus</span> of Lonigo; dedicated to Paul II. Contained a few works only, viz. the &#145;two books <i>c. Gentes</i>,&#146; the letter to Serapion <i>de Morte Arii</i>, the <i>De Incarn. adv. Arian.</i> and <i>adv. Apollin.,</i> &#145;the Dispute with Arius at the Council of Nic&aelig;a.&#146; (2) <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.4"></A>Paris</span>, 1520, pub. by Jean <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.5"></A>Petit</span>: two books <i>c. Gent</i>. fragment of the <i>ad Marcellin</i>. and some &#145;spuria.&#146; (3) Second edition at <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.6"></A>Strassburg</span>, 1522. (4) <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.7"></A>Basel</span>, 1527, by <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.8"></A>Eramus</span>: <i>Serap</i>. ill. and iv., <i>de Decr., Apol. Fug., Apol. c. Ar</i>. (part of), &#145;<i>ad Monach.</i>,&#146; and some &#145;spuria&#146; (he rejected <i>Serap</i>. i. as unworthy of Athan.!). (5) <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.9"></A>Lyons</span>, 1532, same contents as numbers (2) and (4), but with renderings by Politian, Reuchlin, Erasmus, &amp;c. (6) <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.10"></A>Cologne</span>, 1632, similar contents. (7) 1556, <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.11"></A>Basel</span> (&#145;apud Frobenium&#146;), by P. <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.12"></A>Nannius</span>, in 4 volumes; great advance on previous editions. 3 vols. contain the version by Nannius of the &#145;genuina,&#146; the fourth &#145;spuria,&#146; rendered by others. The Nannian version was ably tested, and found wanting, under the direction of the congregation of the Index (Migne xxv. pp. xviii. <i>sqq</i>.). (8) 1564 (or 1584?) <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.13"></A>Basel</span> (substantially the same). (9) 1570, <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.14"></A>Paris</span>, <i>Vita Antonii</i> and &#145;five dialogues <i>de Trin</i>.,&#146; version of Beza. (10) 1572, <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.15"></A>Paris</span>, five volumes, combining Nos. 7 and 9. (II) 1574, <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.16"></A>Paris</span>, Letter <i>ad Amun, Letter</i> 39 (fragment), Letter <i>ad Rufinianum</i>. (12) 1581, <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.17"></A>Paris</span>, incorporating the latter with No. 10. (13) <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p5.18"></A>Rome</span>, 1623, the spurious <i>de variis qu&aelig;stionibus</i>.</p>  
<p class="c12"><a name="v.i.i-p6"></A>(B) The first Greek Edition (14) 1601 at <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p6.1"></A>Heidelberg</span> by <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p6.2"></A>Commelinus</span>, with the Nannian Latin version (2 vols. fo. with a supplement of fragments, letters, &amp;c., communicated by P. Felckmann). This edition was founded upon Felckmann&#146;s collation of numerous <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p6.3"></A>mss.</span>, of which the chief were (<span class="Greek"><a name="v.i.i-p6.4"></A>&#945;</span>) that in the Public Library at Basel (s&aelig;c. xiv., <i>not</i> ix.&#8211;x. as Felck. states; formerly belonged to the Dominican Friary there). (<span class="Greek"><a name="v.i.i-p6.5"></A>&#946;</span>) The &#145;Codex Christophorsoni,&#146; now at Trin. Coll., Camb., s&aelig;c. xvi. <i>ineunt</i>. (<span class="Greek"><a name="v.i.i-p6.6"></A>&#947;</span>) A &#145;Codex Goblerianus&#146; dated 1319, formerly <span class="Greek"><a name="v.i.i-p6.7"></A>&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#956;&#959;&#957;&#8134;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#8055;&#950;&#959;&#965;</span>, and principally used by Nannius. Neither this nor the remaining <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p6.8"></A>mss.</span> of Felckmann are as yet, I believe, identified. (Particulars, Migne, P.G. xxv. p. xliii.) (15) 1608, <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p6.9"></A>Paris</span>, pub. by C. Chappelet, edited by Fronton le Duc, S.J., Latin only. (17) 1612, <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p6.10"></A>Paris</span>, No. 15, with <i>Vit. Ant</i>. in Greek and Latin, from an edition (16) of 1611, <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p6.11"></A>Augsburg</span>, by H&ouml;schel, 4&ordm;. (18) 1627, <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p6.12"></A>Paris</span>, Greek text of 1601 with version of Nannius from edition No. 17, both injudiciously revised by Jean le Pescheur, from the critical notes of Felckmann himself, which however are omitted in this edition. (19) &#145;Cologne,&#146; or rather <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p6.13"></A>Leipzig</span>, 1686, poor reprint of No. 18 with the <i>Syntagma Doctrin&aelig;</i> which Arnold had published in the previous year (see below, ch. ii. &sect;9). (Montf. wrongly dates this 1681.)</p>  
<p class="c12"><a name="v.i.i-p7"></A>(C) All the above were entirely superseded by the great (20) 1698 Paris Benedictine Edition by Bernard de <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p7.1"></A>Montfaucon</span>, aided, for part of vol. 1, by Jacques Loppin, 3 volumes fol. (i.e. vol. 1, parts 1 and 2, &#145;genuina,&#146; vol. 2 &#145;dubia et spuria&#146;), with a <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p7.2"></A>new</span> Latin Version and ample prolegomena, &amp;c. Montfaucon took over, apparently without revision, the critical data of Felckmann (including his mistake as to the age of the Basel <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p7.3"></A>ms.</span> but collated very many fresh <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p7.4"></A>mss.</span> (principally Parisian, full particulars in Migne xxvi. pp. 1449, <i>sqq</i>.), and for the first time put the text on a fairly satisfactory footing. The Works of Athanasius were freshly arranged with an attempt at chronological order, and a &#145;Monitum&#146; or short introduction prefixed to each. Critical, and a few explanatory, notes throughout; also an &#145;onomasticon&#146; or glossary. This splendid edition was far more complete than its predecessors, and beautifully printed. After its completion, Montfaucon discovered fresh material, most of which he published in vol. 2 of his &#145;<span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p7.5"></A>Collectio Nova Patrum</span>,&#146; Paris, 1706, with some further supplementary matter to his Prolegomena, partly in reply to Tillemont upon various critical questions; small additions in his <i>Biblioth. Coisliniana</i>, 1715. (The letters to Lucifer, included in Montfaucon&#146;s edition, had already seen the light in vol. iv. of the Bibliotheca Maxima Patrum (Lyons, 1677, Greek fathers in Latin only), and the two notes to Orsisius were taken from the life of Pachomius in the Acta SS. for May.)</p>  
<p class="c12"><a name="v.i.i-p8"></A>(21) 1746, <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p8.1"></A>Rome</span>, the <i>de Titulis Psalmorum</i>, edited from Barberini and Vatican <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p8.2"></A>mss.</span> by Cardinal Niccolo <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p8.3"></A>Antonelli</span>. (22) 1769, <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p8.4"></A>Venice</span>, vol. v. of the &#145;Bibliotheca Patrum&#146; of the Oratorian Andrea <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p8.5"></A>Gallandi</span>. Contains the works omitted in No. 20, chiefly from Montf. <i>Coll. Nov</i>., but with a few minor additions, and with the fragments and letters found by Maffei at Verona (see below, pp. 495, 554). (23) 1777, <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p8.6"></A>Padua</span>, by <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p8.7"></A>Giustiniani</span>, in four volumes, containing firstly Montfaucon&#146;s &#145;genuina&#146; in two volumes, the &#145;dubia&#146; and &#145;spuria&#146; in the third, and the supplementary matter from (21) and (22) in the fourth. The printing of this standard edition is not equal to that of No. 20. (24) &#145;1884&#146; (1857), <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p8.8"></A>Paris</span>, vols. xxv.&#8211;xxviii. of <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p8.9"></A>Migne&#146;s</span> Patrologia Gr&aelig;ca, a reprint of No. 23, but in a new order (see vol. xxviii. p. 1650), and with the addition of the <i>Festal Letters</i> from Mai (see below, p. 501). The merits and demerits of this series are well known. Of the latter, the most serious are the misprints, with which every page literally teems.</p>  
<p class="c12"><a name="v.i.i-p9"></A>(D) With Migne&#146;s edition the publication of a complete Athanasius (so far as his works are known to be extant) is attained, although there is still everything to be done towards the revision of the text on a critical basis. Among modern editions of large portions of Athanasius from the Benedictine text may be mentioned (25) <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p9.1"></A>Thilo</span>, <i>Athan. Opp. dogm. Selecta</i>, Leipz. 1853. (26) <span class="c10"><a name="v.i.i-p9.2"></A>Bright</span>, <i>Orations against the Arians</i> (1873 2nd ed. 1883), and <i>Historical Writings</i> of Athanasius, 1881 (Oxf. Univ. Press), with introductions; both <A NAME="page_xii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xii</FONT></A> <a name="v.i.i-Page_xii"></A>most convenient; his <i>Lessons from the lives of three great Fathers</i> (Longmans, 1890) gives an interesting popular study of Athan. Editions of separate books will be noticed in the short Introductions prefixed in this volume.</p>
