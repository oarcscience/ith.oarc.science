<span id="xxi.ii.vi.viii-p1"></span> *§25. Marcellian illustration from*
<span id="xxi.ii.vi.viii-p1.1"></span>*[1 Cor. xii.

<span id="xxi.ii.vi.viii-p2"></span>25. Arius then raves in saying that
the Son is from nothing, and that once He was not, while Sabellius also
raves in saying that the Father is Son, and again, the Son Father <span
id="fr_3380"></span>[3381](#fn_3380) , in subsistence <span
id="fr_3381"></span>[3382](#fn_3381) One, in name Two; and he <span
id="fr_3382"></span>[3383](#fn_3382) raves also in using as an example
the grace of the Spirit. For he says, ‘As there are “diversities of
gifts, but the same Spirit,” so also the Father is the same <span
id="fr_3383"></span>[3384](#fn_3383) , but is dilated into Son and
Spirit.’ Now this is full of absurdity; for if as with the Spirit, so it
is with God, the Father will be Word and Holy Spirit, to one becoming
Father, to another Son, to another Spirit, accommodating himself to the
need of each, and in name indeed Son and Spirit, but in reality Father
only; having a beginning in that He becomes a Son, and then ceasing to
be called Father, and made man in name, but in truth not even coming
among us; and untrue in saying ‘I and the Father,’ but in reality being
Himself the Father, and the other absurdities which result in the
instance of Sabellius. And the name of the Son and the Spirit will
necessarily cease, when the need has been supplied; and what happens
will altogether be but make-belief, because it has been displayed, not
in truth, but in name. And the Name of Son ceasing, as they hold, then
the grace of Baptism will cease too; for it was given in the Son <span
id="fr_3384"></span>[3385](#fn_3384) . Nay, what will follow but the
annihilation of the creation? for if the Word came forth that we might
be created <span id="fr_3385"></span>[3386](#fn_3385) , and when He was
come forth, we were, it is plain that when He retires into the Father,
as they say, we shall be no longer. For He will be as He was; so also we
shall not be, as then we were not; for when He is no more gone forth,
there will no more be a creation. This then is absurd.
