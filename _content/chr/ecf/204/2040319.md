<span id="xix.ii.xvi-p1"></span> 6. *The Lord’s example followed by the
Saints.*

<span id="xix.ii.xvi-p2"></span>Our Lord therefore, as I said before,
thus offered Himself for all; and the Saints having received this
example from their Saviour (for all of them before His coming, nay
always, were under His teaching), in their conflicts with their
persecutors acted lawfully in flying, and hiding themselves when they
were sought after. And being ignorant, as men, of the end of the time
which Providence had appointed unto them, they were unwilling at once to
deliver themselves up into the power of those who conspired against
them. But knowing on the other hand what is written, that ‘the portions’
of man ‘are in God’s hand <span id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462) ,’
and that ‘the Lord killeth <span id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463) ,’
and the Lord ‘maketh alive,’ they the rather endured unto the end,
‘wandering about <span id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464) ,’ as the
Apostle has said, ‘in sheepskins, and goatskins, being destitute,
tormented, wandering in deserts,’ and hiding themselves ‘in dens and
caves of the earth;’ until either the appointed time of death arrived,
or God who had appointed their time spake unto them, and stayed the
designs of their enemies, or else delivered up the perse<span
id="page_261">p. 261</span> <span id="xix.ii.xvi-Page_261"></span>cuted
to their persecutors, according as it seemed to Him to be good. This we
may well learn respecting all men from David: for when Joab instigated
him to slay Saul, he said, ‘As the Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite
him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and
be delivered to the enemies; the Lord forbid that I should stretch forth
my hand against the Lord’s anointed <span
id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465) .’
