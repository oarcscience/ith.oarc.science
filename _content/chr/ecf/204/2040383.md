<span id="xxi.ii.vi.iii-p2"></span>8. Eusebius and his fellows, that is,
the Ario-maniacs, ascribing a beginning of being to the Son, yet pretend
not to wish Him to have a beginning of kingship <span
id="fr_3317"></span>[3318](#fn_3317) . But this is ridiculous; for he
who ascribes to the Son a beginning of being, very plainly ascribes to
Him also a beginning of reigning; so blind are they, confessing what
they deny. Again, those who say that the Son is only a name, and that
the Son of God, that is, the Word of the Father, is unessential and
non-subsistent, pretend to be angry with those who say, ‘Once He was
not.’ This is ridiculous also; for they who give Him no being at all,
are angry with those who at least grant Him to be in time. Thus these
also confess what they deny, in the act of censuring the others. And
again Eusebius and his fellows, confessing a Son, deny that He is the
Word by nature, and would have the Son called Word notionally; and the
others confessing Him to be Word, deny Him to be Son, and would have the
Word called Son notionally, equally void of footing.
