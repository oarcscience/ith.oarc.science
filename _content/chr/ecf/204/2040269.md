<span id="xviii.ii.iv-p1"></span> 4. *The movements of Athanasius refute
this charge.*

<span id="xviii.ii.iv-p2"></span>This certainly is sufficient for proof,
yet suffer me nevertheless to lay before you an account of my travels,
which will further lead you to condemn the unfounded calumnies of my
opponents. When I left Alexandria <span
id="fr_1296"></span>[1297](#fn_1296) , I did not go to your brother’s
head-quarters, or to any other persons, but only to Rome; and having
laid my case before the Church (for this was my only concern), I spent
my time in the public worship. I did not write to your brother, except
when Eusebius and his fellows had written to him to accuse me, and I was
compelled while yet at Alexandria to defend myself; and again when I
sent to him volumes <span id="fr_1297"></span>[1298](#fn_1297)
containing the holy Scriptures, which he had ordered me to prepare for
him. It behoves me, while I defend my conduct, to tell the truth to your
Piety. When however three years had passed away, he wrote to me in the
fourth year <span id="fr_1298"></span>[1299](#fn_1298) , commanding me
to meet him (he was then at Milan); and upon enquiring the cause (for I
was ignorant of it, the Lord is my witness), I learnt that certain
Bishops <span id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299) had gone up and
requested him to write to your Piety, desiring that a Council might be
called. Believe me, Sire, this is the truth of the matter; I lie not.
Accordingly I went down to Milan, and met with great kindness from him;
for he condescended to see me, and to say that he had despatched letters
to you, requesting that a Council might be called. And while I remained
in that city, he sent for me again into Gaul (for the father Hosius was
going thither), that we might travel from thence to Sardica. And after
the Council, he wrote to me while I continued at Naissus <span
id="fr_1300"></span>[1301](#fn_1300) , and I went up, and abode
afterwards at Aquileia; where the <span id="page_240">p. 240</span>
<span id="xviii.ii.iv-Page_240"></span>letters of your Piety found me.
And again, being invited thence by your departed brother, I returned
into Gaul, and so came at length to your Piety.

alludes in this passage to the *Synopsis Scr. Sacr.* which is among his
works; but Montfaucon, *Collect. Nov.* t. 2. p. xxviii. contends that a
copy of the Gospels is spoken of. \[cf. D.C.B. i. 651.\]

present at the Council of Milan \[345\], at which Eudoxius, Martyrius,
and Macedonius, sent to the west with the Eusebian Creed, made their
appearance to no purpose. \[But this was long after the events related
in the text, cf. Prolegg. ii. §6, *sub. fin.*\]

Naissus was situated in Upper Dacia, and according to some was the
birthplace of Constantine. The Bishop of the place, Gaudentius, whose
name occurs among the subscriptions at Sardica, had protected S. Paul of
Constantinople and incurred the anathemas of the Easterns at
Philippopolis. Hil. *Fragm.* iii. 27.
