<span id="xix.ii.vii-p1"></span> 7. *Outrages of George.*

<span id="xix.ii.vii-p2"></span>And having seized upon forty men, he
beat them after a new fashion. Cutting some sticks fresh from the palm
tree, with the thorns still upon them <span
id="fr_1415"></span>[1416](#fn_1415) , he scourged them on the back so
severely, that some of them were for a long time under surgical
treatment on account of the thorns which had broken off in their flesh,
and others unable to bear up under their sufferings died. All those whom
they had taken, and the virgin, they sent away together into banishment
to the great Oasis. And the bodies of those who had perished they would
not at first suffer to be given up to their friends, but concealed them
in any way they pleased, and cast them out without burial <span
id="fr_1416"></span>[1417](#fn_1416) , in order that they might not
appear to have any knowledge of these cruel proceedings. But herein
their deluded minds greatly misled them. For the relatives of the dead,
both rejoicing at the confession, and grieving for the bodies of their
friends, published abroad so much the more this proof of their impiety
and cruelty. Moreover they immediately banished out of Egypt and Libya
the following Bishops <span id="fr_1417"></span>[1418](#fn_1417) ,
Ammonius, Muïus <span id="fr_1418"></span>[1419](#fn_1418) , Gaïus,
Philo <span id="fr_1419"></span>[1420](#fn_1419) , Hermes, Plenius,
Psenosiris, Nilammon, Agathus, Anagamphus, Marcus, Ammonius, another
Marcus, Dracontius <span id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420) ,
Adelphius <span id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421) , Athenodorus, and
the Presbyters, Hierax <span id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422) , and
Dioscorus; whom they drove forth under such cruel treatment, that some
of them died on the way, and others in the place of their banishment.
They caused also more than thirty Bishops to take to flight; for their
desire was, after the example of Ahab, if it were possible, utterly to
root out the truth. Such are the enormities of which these impious men
have been guilty.
