<span id="vi.ii.i.xxvi-p1"></span> §26. *The moral corruptions of
Paganism all admittedly originated with the gods.*

<span id="vi.ii.i.xxvi-p2"></span>Women, for example, used to sit out in
old days in the temples of Phœnicia, consecrating to the gods there the
hire of their bodies, thinking they propitiated their goddess by
fornication, and that they would procure her favour by this. While men,
denying their nature, and no longer wishing to be males, put on the
guise of women, under the idea that they are thus gratifying and
honouring the Mother of their so-called gods. But all live along with
the basest, and vie with the worst among themselves, and as Paul said,
the holy minister of Christ <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141) :
“For their women changed the natural use into that which is against
nature: and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman,
burned in their lust one toward another, men with men working
unseemliness.” 2. But acting in this and in like ways, they admit and
prove that the life of their so-called gods was of the same kind. For
from Zeus they have learned corruption of youth and adultery, from
Aphrodite fornication, from Rhea licentiousness, from Ares murders, and
from other gods other like things, which the laws punish and from which
every sober man turns away. Does it then remain fit to consider them
gods who do such things, instead of reckoning them, for the
licentiousness of their ways, more irrational than the brutes? Is it fit
to consider their worshippers human beings, in<span id="page_18">p.
18</span> <span id="vi.ii.i.xxvi-Page_18"></span>stead of pitying them
as more irrational than the brutes, and more soul-less than inanimate
things? For had they considered the intellectual part of their soul they
would not have plunged headlong into these things, nor have denied the
true God, the Father of Christ.

[Next: The refutation of popular Paganism being taken as conclusive, we
come to the higher form of nature-worship. How Nature witnesses to God
by the mutual dependence of all her parts, which forbid us to think of
any one of them as the supreme God. This shewn at length.](2040072)
