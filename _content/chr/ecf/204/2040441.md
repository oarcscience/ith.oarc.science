<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xxx-p1.1"></span>From Letter XLV</span>.—*(For 373.)*

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xxx-p2"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xxx-p2.1"></span>Let</span> us all take up our
sacrifices, observing distribution to the poor, and enter into the holy
place, as it is written; ‘whither also our forerunner Jesus is entered
for us, having obtained eternal redemption <span
id="fr_4560"></span>[4561](#fn_4560) .’…(*From the same:*)…And this is a
great proof that, whereas we were strangers, we are called friends; from
being formerly aliens, we are become fellow-citizens with the saints,
and are called children of the Jerusalem which is above, whereof that
which Solomon built was a type. For if Moses made all things according
to the pattern shewed him in the mount, it is clear that the service
performed in the tabernacle was a type of the heavenly mysteries,
whereto the Lord, desirous that we should enter, prepared for us the new
and abiding way. And as all the old things were a type of the new, so
the festival that now is, is a type of the joy which is above, to which
coming with psalms and spiritual songs, let us begin the fasts <span
id="fr_4561"></span>[4562](#fn_4561) .
