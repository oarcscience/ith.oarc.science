<span id="xxi.ii.vi.iv-p1"></span> *§§9, 10. Unless Father and Son are
two in name only, or as parts and so each imperfect, or two gods, they
are coessential, one in Godhead, and the Son from the Father.*

<span id="xxi.ii.vi.iv-p2"></span>9. ‘I and the Father are One <span
id="fr_3318"></span>[3319](#fn_3318) .’ You say that the two things are
one, or that the one has two names, or again that the one is divided
into two. Now if the one is divided into two, that which is divided must
need be a body, and neither part perfect, for each is a part and not a
whole. But if again the one have two names, this is the expedient of
Sabellius, who said that Son and Father were the same, and did away with
either, the Father when there is a Son, and the Son when there is a
Father. But if the two are one, then of necessity they are two, but one
according to the Godhead, and according to the Son’s coessentiality with
the Father, and the Word’s being from the Father Himself; so that there
are two, because there is Father, and Son, namely the Word; and one
because one God. For if not, He would have said, ‘I am the Father,’ or
‘I and the Father am;’ but, in fact, in the ‘I’ He signifies the Son,
and in the ‘And the Father,’ Him who begat Him; and in the ‘One’ the one
Godhead and His coessentiality <span
id="fr_3319"></span>[3320](#fn_3319) . For the Same is not, as the
Gentiles hold, Wise and Wisdom, or the Same Father and Word; for it were
unfit for Him to be His own Father, but the divine teaching knows Father
and Son, and Wise and Wisdom, and God and Word; while it ever guards Him
indivisible and inseparable and indissoluble in all respects.

<span id="xxi.ii.vi.iv-p5"></span>10. But if any one, on hearing that
the Father and the Son are two, misrepresent us as preaching two Gods
(for this is what some feign to themselves, and forthwith mock, saying,
‘You hold two Gods’), we must answer to such, If to acknowledge Father
and Son, is to hold two Gods, it instantly <span
id="fr_3320"></span>[3321](#fn_3320) follows that to confess but one we
must deny the Son and Sabellianise. For if to speak of two is to fall
into Gentilism, therefore if we speak of one, we must fall into
Sabellianism. But this is not so; perish the thought! but, as when we
say that Father and Son are two, we still confess one God, so when we
say that there is one God, let us consider Father and Son two, while
they are one in the Godhead, and in the Father’s Word being indissoluble
and indivisible and inseparable from Him. And let the fire and the
radiance from it be a similitude of man, which are two in being and in
appearance, but one in that its radiance is from it indivisibly.
