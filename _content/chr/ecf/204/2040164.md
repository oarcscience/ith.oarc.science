<span id="x.ii-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="x.ii-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="x.ii-p3.1"></span>We</span> believe in one Unbegotten <span
id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427) God, Father Almighty, maker of all
things both visible and invisible, that hath His being from Himself. And
in one Only-begotten Word, Wisdom, Son, begotten of the Father without
beginning and eternally; word not pronounced <span
id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428) nor mental, nor an effluence <span
id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429) of the Perfect, nor a dividing of the
impassible Essence, nor an issue <span id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430)
; but absolutely perfect Son, living and powerful ([Heb. iv.
12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012)<span id="x.ii-p7.4"></span>), the
true Image of the Father, equal in honour and glory. For this, he says,
‘is the will of the Father, that as they honour the Father, so they may
honour the Son also’ ([Joh. v. 23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023)<span
id="x.ii-p7.5"></span>): very God of very God, as John says in his
general Epistles, ‘And we are in Him that is true, even in His Son Jesus
Christ: this is the true God and everlasting life’ ([1 Joh. v.
20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020)<span id="x.ii-p7.6"></span>):
Almighty of Almighty. For all things which the Father rules and sways,
the Son rules and sways likewise: wholly from the Whole, being
like <span id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431) the Father as the Lord
says, ‘he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father’ ([Joh. xiv.
9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009)<span id="x.ii-p8.2"></span>). But He
was begotten ineffably and incomprehensibly, for ‘who shall declare his
generation?’ ([Isa. liii. 8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008)<span
id="x.ii-p8.3"></span>), in other words, no one can. Who, when at the
consummation of the ages ([Heb. ix.
26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026)<span id="x.ii-p8.4"></span>), He
had descended from the bosom of the Father, took from the undefiled
Virgin Mary our humanity (<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ii-p8.5"></span>ἄ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ii-p8.6"></span>νθρωπον</span>), Christ Jesus, whom He delivered
of His own will to suffer for us, as the Lord saith: ‘No man taketh My
life from Me. I have power to lay it down, and have power to take it
again’ ([Joh. x. 18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018)<span
id="x.ii-p8.7"></span>). In which humanity He was crucified and died for
us, and rose from the dead, and was taken up into the heavens, having
been created as the beginning of ways for us ([Prov. viii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022)<span id="x.ii-p8.8"></span>), when
on earth He shewed us light from out of darkness, salvation from error,
life from the dead, an entrance to paradise, from which Adam was cast
out, and into which he again entered by means of the thief, as the Lord
said, ‘This day shalt thou be with Me in paradise’ ([Luke xxiii.
43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043)<span id="x.ii-p8.9"></span>), into
which Paul also once entered. \[He shewed us\] also a way up to the
heavens, whither the humanity of the Lord <span
id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432) , in which He will judge the quick and
the dead, entered as precursor for us. We believe, likewise, also in the
Holy Spirit that searcheth all things, even the deep things of God ([1
Cor. ii. 10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010)<span
id="x.ii-p9.4"></span>), and we anathematise doctrines contrary to this.

<span id="x.ii-p10"></span>2. For neither do we hold a Son-Father, as do
the Sabellians, calling Him of one but not of the same <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433) essence, and thus destroying the
existence of the Son. Neither do we ascribe the passible body which He
bore for the salvation of the whole world to the Father. Neither can we
imagine three Subsistences separated from each other, as results from
their bodily nature in the case of men, lest we hold a plurality of gods
like the heathen. But just as a river, produced from a well, is not
separate, and yet there are in fact two visible objects and two names.
For neither is the Father the Son, nor the Son the Father. For the
Father is Father of the Son, and the Son, Son of the Father. For like as
the well is not a river, nor the river a well, but both are one and the
same water which is conveyed in a channel from the well to the river, so
the Father’s deity passes into the Son without flow and without
division. For the Lord says, ‘I came out from the Father and am come’
([Joh. xvi. 28](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#028)<span
id="x.ii-p11.8"></span>). But He is ever <span id="page_85">p. 85</span>
<span id="x.ii-Page_85"></span>with the Father, for He is in the bosom
of the Father, nor was ever the bosom of the Father void of the deity of
the Son. For He says, ‘I was by Him as one setting in order’ ([Prov.
viii. 30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030)<span
id="x.ii-p11.9"></span>). But we do not regard God the Creator of all,
the Son of God, as a creature, or thing made, or as made out of nothing,
for He is truly existent from Him who exists, alone existing from Him
who alone exists, in as much as the like glory and power was eternally
and conjointly begotten of the Father. For ‘He that hath seen’ the Son
‘hath seen the Father ([Joh. xiv.
9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009)<span id="x.ii-p11.10"></span>). All
things to wit were made through the Son; but He Himself is not a
creature, as Paul says of the Lord: ‘In Him were all things created, and
He is before all’ ([Col. i. 16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016)<span
id="x.ii-p11.11"></span>). Now He says not, ‘was created’ before all
things, but ‘is’ before all things. To be created, namely, is applicable
to all things, but ‘is before all’ applies to the Son only.

<span id="x.ii-p12"></span>3. He is then by nature an Offspring, perfect
from the Perfect, begotten before all the hills ([Prov. viii.
25](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#025)<span id="x.ii-p12.1"></span>), that
is before every rational and intelligent essence, as Paul also in
another place calls Him ‘first-born of all creation’ ([Col. i.
15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015)<span id="x.ii-p12.2"></span>). But
by calling Him First-born, He shews that He is not a Creature, but
Offspring of the Father. For it would be inconsistent with His deity for
Him to be called a creature. For all things were created by the Father
through the Son, but the Son alone was eternally begotten from the
Father, whence God the Word is ‘first-born of all creation,’
unchangeable from unchangeable. However, the body which He wore for our
sakes is a creature: concerning which Jeremiah says, according to the
edition of the seventy translators <span
id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434) ([Jer. xxxi.
22](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#022)<span id="x.ii-p13.2"></span>): ‘The
Lord created for us for a planting a new salvation, in which salvation
men shall go about:’ but according to Aquila the same text runs: ‘The
Lord created a new thing in woman.’ Now the salvation created for us for
a planting, which is new, not old, and for us, not before us, is Jesus,
Who in respect of the Saviour <span id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435)
was made man, and whose name is translated in one place Salvation, in
another Saviour. But salvation proceeds from the Saviour, just as
illumination does from the light. The salvation, then, which was from
the Saviour, being created new, did, as Jeremiah says, ‘create for us a
new salvation,’ and as Aquila renders: ‘The Lord created a new thing in
woman,’ that is in Mary. For nothing new was created in woman, save the
Lord’s body, born of the Virgin Mary without intercourse, as also it
says in the Proverbs in the person of Jesus: ‘The Lord created me, a
beginning of His ways for His works’ ([Prov. viii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022)<span id="x.ii-p14.2"></span>). Now
He does not say, ‘created me before His works,’ lest any should take the
text of the deity of the Word.

<span id="x.ii-p15"></span>4. Each text then which refers to the
creature is written with reference to Jesus in a bodily sense. For the
Lord’s Humanity <span id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436) was created as
‘a beginning of ways,’ and He manifested it to us for our salvation. For
by it we have our access to the Father. For He is the way ([Joh. xiv.
6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006)<span id="x.ii-p16.2"></span>) which
leads us back to the Father. And a way is a corporeal visible thing,
such as is the Lord’s humanity. Well, then, the Word of God created all
things, not being a creature, but an offspring. For He created none of
the created things equal or like unto Himself. But it is the part of a
Father to beget, while it is a workman’s part to create. Accordingly,
that body is a thing made and created, which the Lord bore for us, which
was begotten for us <span id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437) , as Paul
says, ‘wisdom from God, and sanctification and righteousness, and
redemption;’ while yet the Word was before us and before all Creation,
and is, the Wisdom of the Father. But the Holy Spirit, being that which
proceeds from the Father, is ever in the hands <span
id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438) of the Father Who sends and of the Son
Who conveys Him, by Whose means He filled all things. The Father,
possessing His existence from Himself, begat the Son, as we said, and
did not create Him, as a river from a well and as a branch from a root,
and as brightness from a light, things which nature knows to be
indivisible; through whom to the Father be glory and power and greatness
before all ages, and unto all the ages of the ages. Amen.

<span id="x.ii-p8"></span> This word, which became the watchword of the
Acacian party, the successors of the Eusebians, marks the relatively
early date of this treatise. At a later period Athanasius would not use
it without qualification (see *Orat.* ii. §22, note 4), and later still,
rejected the Word entirely as misleading (*de Synodis,* §53. note 9).
