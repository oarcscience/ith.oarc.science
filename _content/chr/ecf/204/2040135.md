<span id="vii.ii.xxxviii-p1"></span> §38. *Other clear prophecies of the
coming of God in the flesh. Christ’s miracles unprecedented.*

<span id="vii.ii.xxxviii-p2"></span>For if they do not think these
proofs sufficient, let them be persuaded at any rate by other reasons,
drawn from the oracles they themselves possess. For of whom do the
prophets say: “I was <span id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299) made
manifest to them that sought me not, I was found of them that asked not
for me: I said Behold, here am I, to the nation that had not called upon
my name; I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying
people.” 2. Who, then, one might say to the Jews, is he that was made
manifest? For if it is the prophet, let them say when he was hid,
afterward to appear again. And what manner of prophet is this, that was
not only made manifest from obscurity, but also stretched out his hands
on the Cross? None surely of the righteous, save the Word of God only,
Who, incorporeal by nature, appeared for our sakes in the body and
suffered for all. 3. Or if not even this is sufficient for them, let
them at least be silenced by another proof, seeing how clear its
demonstrative force is. For the Scripture says: “Be strong <span
id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300) ye hands that hang down, and feeble
knees; comfort ye, ye of faint mind; be strong, fear not. Behold, our
God recompenseth judgment; He shall come and save us. Then shall the
eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear; then
shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the stammerers
shall be plain.” 4. Now what can they say to this, or how can they dare
to face this at all? For the prophecy not only indicates that God is to
sojourn here, but it announces the signs and the time of His coming. For
they connect the blind recovering their sight, and the lame walking, and
the deaf hearing, and the tongue of the stammerers being made plain,
with the Divine Coming which is to take place. Let them say, then, when
such signs have come to pass in Israel, or where <span id="page_57">p.
57</span> <span id="vii.ii.xxxviii-Page_57"></span>in Jewry anything of
the sort has occurred. 5. Naaman, a leper, was cleansed, but no deaf man
heard nor lame walked. Elias raised a dead man; so did Eliseus; but none
blind from birth regained his sight. For in good truth, to raise a dead
man is a great thing, but it is not like the wonder wrought by the
Saviour. Only, if Scripture has not passed over the case of the leper,
and of the dead son of the widow, certainly, had it come to pass that a
lame man also had walked and a blind man recovered his sight, the
narrative would not have omitted to mention this also. Since then
nothing is said in the Scriptures, it is evident that these things had
never taken place before. 6. When, then, have they taken place, save
when the Word of God Himself came in the body? Or when did He come, if
not when lame men walked, and stammerers were made to speak plain, and
deaf men heard, and men blind from birth regained their sight? For this
was the very thing the Jews said who then witnessed it, because they had
not heard of these things having taken place at any other time:
“Since <span id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301) the world began it was
never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind. If this
man were not from God, He could do nothing.”
