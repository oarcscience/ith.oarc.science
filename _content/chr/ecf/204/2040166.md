<span id="xi.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="xi.i-p3"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xi.i-p3.1"></span>This</span> memorandum or short article was
written, as its first sentence shews, during the lifetime of Eusebius of
Nicomedia, and therefore not later than the summer of <span
class="c10"><span id="xi.i-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> 342. The somewhat
abrupt beginning, and the absence of any exposition of the latter
portion of the text, have led to the inference that the work is a
fragment: but its conclusion is evidently perfect, and the opening words
probably refer to the text itself. The tract is a reply to the Arian
argument founded upon [Luke 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#022),
[Matt. 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027)<span
id="xi.i-p3.3"></span>). If ‘all things’ had been delivered to the Son
by the Father, it would follow that once He was without them. Now ‘all
things’ include His Divine Sonship. Therefore there was a time when the
Son was not. Athanasius meets this argument by totally denying the minor
premise. By ‘all things,’ he argues, Christ referred to His mediatorial
work and its glories, not to His essential nature as Word of God. He
then adduces [Joh. xvi. 15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#015)<span
id="xi.i-p3.4"></span>, to shew at once the Son’s distinctness from the
Father, and that the Father’s attributes must also be those of the Son.

<span id="xi.i-p4"></span>The interpretation of the main text given in
this tract was not subsequently maintained by Athanasius: in *Orat*.
iii. 35, he explains it of the Son, as safeguarding His separate
personality against the Sabellians. It should, however, be noted that
this change of ground does not involve any concession to the Arian use
of the passage: it merely transfers the denial of Athanasius from their
minor to their major premise.

<span id="xi.i-p5"></span>Beyond the fact that the tract was written
before 342 there is no conclusive evidence as to its date. But it is
generally placed (Montfaucon, Ceillier, Alzog) before the ‘Encyclical,’
which was written in 339, and in several particulars it differs from the
later anti-Arian treatises: perhaps then we may conjecturally place it
about 335, i.e. before the first exile of the ‘Pope.’
