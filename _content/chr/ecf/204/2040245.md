<span id="xvi.ii.xxxiv-p1"></span> 80. ‘And these signs are sufficient
to prove that the faith of Christ alone is the true religion. But see!
you still do not believe and are seeking for arguments. We however make
our proof “not in the persuasive words of Greek wisdom <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127) ” as our teacher has it, but we
persuade by the faith which manifestly precedes argumentative proof.
Behold there are here some vexed with demons;’—now there were certain
who had come to him very disquieted by demons, and bringing them into
the midst he said,—‘Do you cleanse them either by arguments and by
whatever art or magic you choose, calling upon your idols, or if you are
unable, put away your strife with us and you shall see the power of the
Cross of Christ.’ And having said this he called upon Christ, and signed
the sufferers two or three times with the sign of the Cross. And
immediately the men stood up whole, and in their right mind, and
forthwith gave thanks unto the Lord. And the philosophers, as they are
called, wondered, and were astonished exceedingly at the understanding
of the man and at the sign which had been wrought. But Antony said, ‘Why
marvel ye at this? We are not the doers of these things, but it is
Christ who worketh them by means of those who believe on Him. Believe,
therefore, also yourselves, and you shall see that with us there is no
trick of words, but faith through love which is wrought in us towards
Christ; which if you yourselves should obtain you will no longer seek
demonstrative arguments, but will consider faith in Christ sufficient.’
These are the words of Antony. And they marvelling at this also, saluted
him and departed, confessing the benefit they had received from
him <span id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128) .

<span id="xvi.ii.xxxiv-p3"></span> The above argument with the
philosophers runs upon the general lines of that of Athanasius *c.
Gent.* The point which we miss here is the Euhemerism upon which
Athanasius so strongly insists. This latter view would be naturally less
congenial to Antony’s mind than the view that the gods were merely
demons.
