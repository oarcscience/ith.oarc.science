forth still more eagerly bent on the service of God and having fallen in
with the old man he had met previously, he asked him to dwell with him
in the desert. But when the other declined on account of his great age,
and because as yet there was no such custom, Antony himself set off
forthwith to the mountain. And yet again the enemy seeing his zeal and
wishing to hinder it, cast in his way what seemed to be a great silver
dish. But Antony, seeing the guile of the Evil One, stood, and having
looked on the dish, he put the devil in it to shame, saying, ‘Whence
comes a dish in the desert? This road is not well-worn, nor is there
here a trace of any wayfarer; it could not have fallen without being
missed on account of its size; and he who had lost it having turned
back, to seek it, would have found it, for it is a desert place. This is
some wile of the devil. O thou Evil One, not with this shalt thou hinder
my purpose; let it go with thee to destruction. <span

vanished like smoke from the face of fire.
