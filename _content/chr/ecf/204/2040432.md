received the vineyard from the Saviour, and are invited to the heavenly
banquet, inasmuch as the Feast is now drawing nigh, take the branches of

conquerors of sin, let us too like those, who on that occasion went to
meet the Saviour, make ourselves ready by our conduct, both to meet Him
when He comes, and to go in with Him and partake of the immortal food,
and from thenceforth live eternally in the heavens.
