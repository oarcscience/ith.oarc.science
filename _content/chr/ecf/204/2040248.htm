<p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.xxxvii-p1"></A>  83. Such are the words of Antony, and we ought not to doubt whether such marvels were wrought by the hand of a man. For it is the promise of the Saviour, when He saith, &#145;If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to this mountain, remove hence and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1134"></A><A HREF="#fn_1134"><FONT SIZE="1">1135</FONT></A>
.&#146; And again, &#145;Verily, verily, I say unto you, if ye shall ask the father in My name He will give it you. Ask and ye shall receive&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1135"></A><A HREF="#fn_1135"><FONT SIZE="1">1136</FONT></A>
.&#146; And He himself it is who saith to His disciples and to all who believe on Him, &#145;Heal the sick, cast out demons; freely ye have received, freely give&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1136"></A><A HREF="#fn_1136"><FONT SIZE="1">1137</FONT></A>

So that it was clear to all that it was not he himself who worked, but the Lord who showed mercy by his means and healed the sufferers. But Antony&#146;s part was only prayer and discipline, for the sake of which he stayed in the mountain, rejoicing in the contemplation of divine things, but grieving when troubled by much people, and dragged to the outer mountain. For all judges used to ask him to come down, because it was impossible for them to enter on account of their following of litigants. But nevertheless they asked him to come that they might but see him. When therefore he avoided it and refused to go to them, they remained firm, and sent to him all the more the prisoners under charge of soldiers, that on account of these he might come down. Being forced by necessity, and seeing them lamenting, he came into the outer mountain, and again his labour was not unprofitable. For his coming was advantageous and serviceable to many; and he was of profit to the judges, counselling them to prefer justice to all things; to fear God, and to know, &#145;that with what judgment they judged, they should be judged&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1137"></A><A HREF="#fn_1137"><FONT SIZE="1">1138</FONT></A>
.&#146; But he loved more than all things his sojourn in the mountain.</p>
