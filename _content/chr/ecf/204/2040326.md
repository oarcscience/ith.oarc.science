<span id="xix.ii.xxiii-p1"></span> 23. *Persecution is from the Devil.*

<span id="xix.ii.xxiii-p2"></span>Seeing therefore that such are the
commands of our Saviour, and that such is the conduct of the Saints, let
these persons, to whom one cannot give a name suitable to their
character,—let them, I say, tell us, from whom they learnt to persecute?
They cannot say, from the Saints <span
id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495) . No, but from the Devil (that is
the only answer which is left to them);—from him who says, ‘I will
persue, I will overtake <span id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496) .’
Our Lord commanded to flee, and the saints fled: but persecution is a
device of the Devil, and one which he desires to exercise against all.
Let them say then, to which we ought to submit ourselves; to the words
of the Lord, or to their fabrications? Whose conduct ought we to
imitate, that of the Saints, or that of those whose example these men
have adopted? But since it is likely they cannot determine this question
(for, as Esaias said, their minds and their consciences are blinded, and
they think ‘bitter to be sweet,’ and ‘light darkness <span
id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497) ’) let some one come forth from
among us Christians, and put them to rebuke, and cry with a loud voice,
‘It is better to trust in the Lord, than to attend to the foolish
sayings of these men; for the “words” of the Lord have “eternal
life <span id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498) ,” but the things which
these utter are full of iniquity and blood.’
