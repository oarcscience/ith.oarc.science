<p class="c11"><a name="xxv.iii.iii.xix-p3"></A><span class="c10"><a name="xxv.iii.iii.xix-p3.1"></A>For</span> who is our joy and boast, but our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, Who suffered for us, and by Himself made known to us the Father? For He is no other than He Who of old time spoke by the Prophets; but now He saith to every man, &#145;I Who speak am near&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4525"></A><A HREF="#fn_4525"><FONT SIZE="1">4526</FONT></A>
.&#146; Right well is this word spoken, for He does not at one time speak, at another keep silence; but continually and at all times, from the beginning without ceasing, He raises up every man, and speaks to every man in his heart.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="xxv.iii.iii.xix-p2"></A> The fragment here given of the twenty-seventh Letter, as well as fragments of the twenty-ninth and forty-fourth, are from Syriac translations, discovered by Mr. Cureton as quoted by Severus Patriarch of Antioch, in his work against Johannes Grammaticus contained in the Syriac collection of the British Museum (Cod. Add. 12, 157, fol. 202), and published by him with the preceding Letters. Their style would argue them to be part of the same translation.</p>
