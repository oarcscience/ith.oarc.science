<span id="xviii.ii.xxix-p1"></span> 29. *Athanasius has heard of his own
proscription.*

<span id="xviii.ii.xxix-p2"></span>Such were the rumours that were
noised abroad; and although everything was thus turned upside down, I
still did not relinquish my earnest desire of coming to your Piety, but
was again setting forward on my journey. And I did so the more eagerly,
being confident that these proceedings were contrary to your wishes, and
that if your Grace should be informed of what was done, you would
prevent it for the time to come. For I could not think that a righteous
king could wish Bishops to be banished, and virgins to be stripped, or
the Churches to be in any way disturbed. While I thus reasoned and
hastened on my journey, behold a third report reached me, to the effect
that letters had been written to the Princes of Auxumis, desiring that
Frumentius <span id="fr_1367"></span>[1368](#fn_1367) , Bishop of
Auxumis, should be brought from thence, and that search should be made
for me even as far as the country of the Barbarians, that I might be
handed over to the Commentaries <span
id="fr_1368"></span>[1369](#fn_1368) (as they are called) of the
Prefects, and that all the laity and clergy should be compelled to
communicate with the Arian heresy, and that such as would not comply
with this order should be put to death. To shew that these were not
merely idle rumours, but that they were confirmed by facts, since your
Grace has given me leave, I produce the letter. My enemies were
constantly reading it, and threatening each one with death.
