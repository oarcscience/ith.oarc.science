<span id="xxi.ii.vi.vi"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii.vi.vi-p1"></span> *§§13, 14. Such a doctrine precludes
all real distinctions of personality in the Divine Nature. Illustration
of the Scripture doctrine from* <span id="xxi.ii.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>*[2
Cor. vi. 11](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#011)<span
id="xxi.ii.vi.vi-p1.2"></span>, &c.*

<span id="xxi.ii.vi.vi-p2"></span>13. This perhaps he <span
id="fr_3328"></span>[3329](#fn_3328) borrowed from the Stoics, who
maintain that their God contracts and again expands with the creation,
and then rests without end. For what is dilated is first straitened; and
what is expanded is at first contracted; and it is what it was, and does
but undergo an affection. If then the Monad being dilated became a
Triad, and the Monad was the Father <span
id="fr_3329"></span>[3330](#fn_3329) , and the Triad is Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, first the Monad being dilated, underwent an affection and
became what it was not; for it was dilated, whereas it had not been
dilate. Next, if the Monad itself was dilated into a Triad, and that,
Father and Son and Holy Ghost, then Father and Son and Spirit prove the
same, as Sabellius held, unless the Monad which he speaks of is
some<span id="page_438">p. 438</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.vi.vi-Page_438"></span>thing besides the Father, and then he
ought not to speak of dilatation, since the Monad was to make Three, so
that there was a Monad, and then Father, Son, and Spirit. For if the
Monad were dilated, and expanded itself, it must itself be that which
was expanded. And a Triad when dilated is no longer a Monad, and when a
Monad it is not yet a Triad. And so, He that was Father was not yet Son
and Spirit; but, when become These, is no longer only Father. And a man
who thus should lie, must ascribe a body to God, and represent Him as
passible; for what is dilatation, but an affection of that which is
dilated? or what the dilated, but what before was not so, but was strait
indeed; for it is the same, in time only differing from itself.

<span id="xxi.ii.vi.vi-p5"></span>14. And this the divine Apostle knows,
when he writes to the Corinthians, ‘Be ye not straitened in us, but be
ye yourselves dilated, O Corinthians <span
id="fr_3330"></span>[3331](#fn_3330) ;’ for he advises identical persons
to change from straitness to dilatation. And as, supposing the
Corinthians being straitened were in turn dilated, they had not been
others, but still Corinthians, so if the Father was dilated into a
Triad, the Triad again is the Father alone. And he says again the same
thing, ‘Our heart is dilated <span id="fr_3331"></span>[3332](#fn_3331)
;’ and Noah says, ‘May God dilate for Japheth <span
id="fr_3332"></span>[3333](#fn_3332) ,’ for the same heart and the same
Japheth is in the dilatation. If then the Monad dilated, it would dilate
for others; but if it dilated for itself, then it would be that which
was dilated; and what is that but the Son and Holy Spirit? And it is
well to ask him, when thus speaking, what was the action <span
id="fr_3333"></span>[3334](#fn_3333) of this dilatation? or, in very
truth, wherefore at all it took place? for what does not remain the
same, but is in course of time dilated, must necessarily have a cause of
dilatation. If then it was in order that Word and Spirit should be with
Him, it is beside the purpose to say, ‘First Monad, and then dilated;’
for Word and Spirit were not afterwards, but ever, or God would be
wordless <span id="fr_3334"></span>[3335](#fn_3334) , as the Arians
hold. So that if Word and Spirit were ever, ever was it dilated, and not
at first a Monad; but if it were dilated afterwards, then afterwards is
there a Word. But if for the Incarnation it was dilated, and then became
a Triad, then before the Incarnation there was not yet a Triad. And it
will seem even that the Father became flesh, if, that is, He be the
Monad, and was dilated in the Man; and thus perhaps there will only be a
Monad, and flesh, and thirdly Spirit; if, that is, He was Himself
dilated; and there will be in name only a Triad. It is absurd too to say
that it was dilated for creating; for it were possible for it, remaining
a Monad, to make all; for the Monad did not need dilatation, nor was
wanting in power before being dilated; it is absurd surely and impious,
to think or speak thus in the case of God. Another absurdity too will
follow. For if it was dilated for the sake of the creation, and while it
was a Monad the creation was not, but upon the Consummation it will be
again a Monad after dilatation, then the creation too will come to
nought. For as for the sake of creating it was dilated, so, the
dilatation ceasing, the creation will cease also.
