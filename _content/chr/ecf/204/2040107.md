<span id="vii.ii.x"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.x-p1"></span> §*10. By a like simile, the
reasonableness of the work of redemption is shewn. How Christ wiped away
our ruin, and provided its antidote by His own teaching. Scripture
proofs of the Incarnation of the Word, and of the Sacrifice He wrought.*

<span id="vii.ii.x-p2"></span>Now in truth this great work was
peculiarly suited to God’s goodness. 1. For if a king, having founded a
house or city, if it be beset by bandits from the carelessness of its
inmates, does not by any means neglect it, but avenges and reclaims it
as his own work, having regard not to the carelessness of the
inhabitants, but to what beseems himself; much more did God the Word of
the all-good Father not neglect the race of men, His work, going to
corruption: but, while He blotted out the death which had ensued by the
offering of His own body, He corrected their neglect by His own
teaching, restoring all that was man’s by His own power. 2. And of this
one may be assured at the hands of the Saviour’s own inspired writers,
if one happen upon their writings, where they say: “For the love of
Christ <span id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226) constraineth us; because
we thus judge, that if one died for all, then all died, and He died for
all that we should no longer live unto ourselves, but unto Him Who for
our sakes died and rose again,” our Lord Jesus Christ. And, again:
“But <span id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227) we behold Him, Who hath
been made a little lower than the angels, even Jesus, because of the
suffering of death crowned with glory and honour, that by the grace of
God He should taste of death for every man.” 3. Then He also points out
the reason why it was necessary for none other than God the Word Himself
to become incarnate; as follows: “For it became Him, for Whom are all
things, and through Whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto
glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through
suffering;” by which words He means, that it belonged to none other to
bring man back from the corruption which had begun, than the Word of
God, Who had also made them from the beginning. 4. And that it was in
order to the sacrifice for bodies such as His own that the Word Himself
also assumed a body, to this, also, they refer in these words <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228) : “Forasmuch then as the children are
the sharers in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook
of the same, that through death He might bring to naught Him that had
the power of death, that is, the devil; and might deliver them who,
through fear of death, were all their lifetime subject to bondage.” 5.
For by the sacrifice of His own body, He both put an end to the law
which was against us, and made a new beginning of life for us, by the
hope of resurrection which He has given us. For since from man it was
that death prevailed over men, for this cause conversely, by the Word of
God being made man has come about the destruction of death and the
resurrection of life; as the man which bore Christ <span
id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229) saith: “For <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230) since by man came death, by man came
also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in
Christ shall all be made alive:” and so forth. For no longer now do we
die as subject to condemnation; but as men who rise from the dead we
await the general resurrection of all, “which <span
id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231) <span id="page_42">p. 42</span> <span
id="vii.ii.x-Page_42"></span>in its own times He shall show,” even God,
Who has also wrought it, and bestowed it upon us. 6. This then is the
first cause of the Saviour’s being made man. But one might see from the
following reasons also, that His gracious coming amongst us was fitting
to have taken place.

[Next: Second reason for the Incarnation. God, knowing that man was not
by nature sufficient to know Him, gave him, in order that he might have
some profit in being, a knowledge of Himself. He made them in the Image
of the Word, that thus they might know the Word, and through Him the
Father. Yet man, despising this, fell into idolatry, leaving the unseen
God for magic and astrology; and all this in spite of God's manifold
revelation of Himself.](2040108)
