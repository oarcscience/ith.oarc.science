<span id="xviii.ii.xxvii-p1"></span> 27. *Athanasius leaves Alexandria
to go to Constantius, but is stopped by the news of the banishment of
the Bishops.*

<span id="xviii.ii.xxvii-p2"></span>Observing these things, I did not
give sentence against myself, but hastened to come to your Piety, with
this my defence, knowing your goodness, and remembering your faithful
promises, and being confident that, as it is written in the divine
Proverbs, ‘Just speeches are acceptable to a gracious king <span
id="fr_1359"></span>[1360](#fn_1359) .’ But when I had already entered
upon my journey, and had passed through the desert <span
id="fr_1360"></span>[1361](#fn_1360) , a report suddenly reached
me <span id="fr_1361"></span>[1362](#fn_1361) , which at first I thought
to be incredible, but which afterwards proved to be true. It was
rumoured everywhere that Liberius, Bishop of Rome, the great Hosius of
Spain, Paulinus of Gaul, Dionysius and Eusebius of Italy, Lucifer of
Sardinia, and certain other Bishops and Presbyters and Deacons, had been
banished <span id="fr_1362"></span>[1363](#fn_1362) because they refused
to subscribe to my condemnation. These had been banished: and Vincentius
of Capua, Fortunatian of Aquileia, Heremius of Thessalonica, and all the
Bishops of the West, were treated with no ordinary force, nay were
suffering extreme violence and grievous injuries, until they could be
induced to promise that they would not communicate with me. While I was
astonished and perplexed at these tidings, behold another report <span
id="fr_1363"></span>[1364](#fn_1363) overtook me, respecting them of
Egypt and Libya, that nearly ninety Bishops had been under persecution,
and that their Churches were given up to the professors of Arianism;
that sixteen had been banished, and of the rest, some had <span
id="page_249">p. 249</span> <span
id="xviii.ii.xxvii-Page_249"></span>fled, and others were constrained to
dissemble. For the persecution was said to be so violent in those parts,
that at Alexandria, while the brethren were praying during Easter and on
the Lord’s days in a desert place near the cemetery, the General came
upon them with a force of soldiery, more than three thousand in number,
with arms, drawn swords, and spears; whereupon outrages, such as might
be expected to follow so unprovoked an attack, were committed against
women and children, who were doing nothing more than praying to God. It
would perhaps be unseasonable to give an account of them now, lest the
mere mention of such enormities should move us all to tears. But such
was their cruelty, that virgins were stripped, and even the bodies of
those who died from the blows they received were not immediately given
up for burial, but were cast out to the dogs, until their relatives,
with great risk to themselves, came secretly and stole them away, and
much effort was necessary, that no one might know it.
