to Didymus, are given by Socrates IV. 23, 25: the following is from
Hanmer’s translation of Socr. I. 21: “The same time lived Antony the
monk in the deserts of Ægypt. But inasmuch as Athanasius, Bishop of
Alexandria, hath lately set forth in a several volume, intituled of his
life, his manners and converasiton, how openly he buckled with divils,
how he over-reached their slights and subtle combats, and wrought many
marvellous and strange miracles, I think it superfluous on my part to
intreat thereof.’\]

indebted to my friend and colleague the Rev. H. Ellershaw, jun.
