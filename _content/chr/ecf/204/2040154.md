<span id="vii.ii.lvii-p1"></span> §57. *Above all, so live that you may
have the right to eat of this tree of knowledge and life, and so come to
eternal joys. Doxology.*

<span id="vii.ii.lvii-p2"></span>But for the searching of the Scriptures
and true knowledge of them, an honourable life is needed, and a pure
soul, and that virtue which is according to Christ; so that the
intellect guiding its path by it, may be able to attain what it desires,
and to comprehend it, in so far as it is accessible to human nature to
learn concerning the Word of God. 2. For without a pure mind and a
modelling of the life after the saints, a man could not possibly
comprehend the words of the saints. 3. For just as, if a man wished to
see the light of the sun, he would at any rate wipe and brighten his
eye, purifying himself in some sort like what he desires, so that the
eye, thus becoming light, may see the light of the sun; or as, if a man
would see a city or country, he at any rate comes to the place to see
it;—thus he that would comprehend the mind of those who speak of God
must needs begin by washing and cleansing his soul, by his manner of
living, and approach the saints themselves by imitating their works; so
that, associated with them in the conduct of a common life, he may
understand also what has been revealed to them by God, and thenceforth,
as closely knit to them, may escape the peril of the sinners and their
fire at the day of judgment, and receive what is laid up for the saints
in the kingdom of heaven, which “Eye hath not seen <span
id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350) , nor ear heard, neither have entered
into the heart of man,” whatsoever things are prepared for them that
live a virtuous life, and love the God and Father, in Christ Jesus our
Lord: through Whom and with Whom be to the Father Himself, with the Son
Himself, in the Holy Spirit, honour and might and glory for ever and
ever. Amen.
