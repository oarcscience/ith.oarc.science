### Against the Heathen. (Contra Gentes.)

[Against the Heathen. (Contra Gentes.)](2040042)  
[Introduction.](2040043)  
[Contra Gentes. (Against the Heathen.)](2040044)  
[Part I](2040045)  
[Section 1](2040046)  
[Evil no part of the essential nature of things. The original creation
and constitution of man in grace and in the knowledge of
God.](2040047)  
[The decline of man from the above condition, owing to his absorption in
material things.](2040048)  
[The gradual abasement of the Soul from Truth to Falsehood by the abuse
of her freedom of Choice.](2040049)  
[Evil, then consists essentially in the choice of what is lower in
preference to what is higher.](2040050)  
[False views of the nature of evil: viz., that evil is something in the
nature of things, and has substantive existence. (a) Heathen thinkers:
(evil resides in matter). Their refutation. (b) Heretical teachers:
(Dualism). Refutation from Scripture.](2040051)  
[Refutation of dualism from reason. Impossibility of two Gods. The truth
as to evil is that which the Church teaches: that it originates, and
resides, in the perverted choice of the darkened soul.](2040052)  
[The origin of idolatry is similar. The soul, materialised by forgetting
God, and engrossed in earthly things, makes them into gods. The race of
men descends into a hopeless depth of delusion and
superstition.](2040053)  
[The various developments of idolatry: worship of the heavenly bodies,
the elements, natural objects, fabulous creatures, personified lusts,
men living and dead. The case of Antinous, and of the deified
Emperors.](2040054)  
[Similar human origin of the Greek gods, by decree of Theseus. The
process by which mortals became deified.](2040055)  
[The deeds of heathen deities, and particularly of Zeus.](2040056)  
[Other shameful actions ascribed to heathen deities. All prove that they
are but men of former times, and not even good men.](2040057)  
[The folly of image worship and its dishonour to art.](2040058)  
[Image worship condemned by Scripture.](2040059)  
[The details about the gods conveyed in the representations of them by
poets and artists shew that they are without life, and that they are not
gods, nor even decent men and women.](2040060)  
[Heathen arguments in palliation of the above: and (1) 'the poets are
responsible for these unedifying tales.' But are the names and existence
of the gods any better authenticated? Both stand or fall together.
Either the actions must be defended or the deity of the gods given up.
And the heroes are not credited with acts inconsistent with their
nature, as, on this plea, the gods are.](2040061)  
[The truth probably is, that the scandalous tales are true, while the
divine attributes ascribed to them are due to the flattery of the
poets.](2040062)  
[Heathen defence continued. (2) 'The gods are worshipped for having
invented the Arts of Life.' But this is a human and natural, not a
divine, achievement. And why, on this principle, are not all inventors
deified?](2040063)  
[The inconsistency of image worship. Arguments in palliation. (1) The
divine nature must be expressed in a visible sign. (2) The image a means
of supernatural communications to men through angels.](2040064)  
[But where does this supposed virtue of the image reside? in the
material, or in the form, or in the maker's skill? Untenability of all
these views.](2040065)  
[The idea of communications through angels involves yet wilder
inconsistency, nor does it, even if true, justify the worship of the
image.](2040066)  
[The image cannot represent the true form of God, else God would be
corruptible.](2040067)  
[The variety of idolatrous cults proves that they are false.](2040068)  
[The so-called gods of one place are used as victims in
another.](2040069)  
[Human sacrifice. Its absurdity. Its prevalence. Its calamitous
results.](2040070)  
[The moral corruptions of Paganism all admittedly originated with the
gods.](2040071)  
[The refutation of popular Paganism being taken as conclusive, we come
to the higher form of nature-worship. How Nature witnesses to God by the
mutual dependence of all her parts, which forbid us to think of any one
of them as the supreme God. This shewn at length.](2040072)  
[But neither can the cosmic organism be God. For that would make God
consist of dissimilar parts, and subject Him to possible
dissolution.](2040073)  
[The balance of powers in Nature shews that it is not God, either
collectively, or in parts.](2040074)  
[Part II](2040075)  
[Section 30](2040076)  
[Proof of the existence of the rational soul. (1) Difference of man from
the brutes. (2) Man's power of objective thought. Thought is to sense as
the musician to his instrument. The phenomena of dreams bear this
out.](2040077)  
[(3) The body cannot originate such phenomena; and in fact the action of
the rational soul is seen in its over-ruling the instincts of the bodily
organs.](2040078)  
[§33. The soul immortal. Proved by (1) its being distinct from the body,
(2) its being the source of motion, (3) its power to go beyond the body
in imagination and thought.](2040079)  
[§34. The soul, then, if only it get rid of the stains of sin is able to
know God directly, its own rational nature imaging back the Word of God,
after whose image it was created. But even if it cannot pierce the cloud
which sin draws over its vision, it is confronted by the witness of
creation to God.](2040080)  
[Part III](2040081)  
[Section 35](2040082)  
[This the more striking, if we consider the opposing forces out of which
this order is produced.](2040083)  
[The same subject continued.](2040084)  
[The Unity of God shewn by the Harmony of the order of
Nature.](2040085)  
[Impossibility of a plurality of Gods.](2040086)  
[The rationality and order of the Universe proves that it is the work of
the Reason or Word of God.](2040087)  
[The Presence of the Word in nature necessary, not only for its original
Creation, but also for its permanence.](2040088)  
[This function of the Word described at length.](2040089)  
[Three similes to illustrate the Word's relation to the
Universe.](2040090)  
[The similes applied to the whole Universe, seen and unseen.](2040091)  
[Conclusion. Doctrine of Scripture on the subject of Part I.](2040092)  
[Doctrine of Scripture on the subject of Part 3.](2040093)  
[Necessity of a return to the Word if our corrupt nature is to be
restored.](2040094)  
<span id="section_006"></span>

### The Incarnation of the Word.

[The Incarnation of the Word.](2040095)  
[Introduction.](2040096)  
[On the Incarnation of the Word.](2040097)  
[Section 1](2040098)  
[Erroneous views of Creation rejected. (1) Epicurean (fortuitous
generation). But diversity of bodies and parts argues a creating
intellect. (2.) Platonists (pre-existent matter.) But this subjects God
to human limitations, making Him not a creator but a mechanic. (3)
Gnostics (an alien Demiurge). Rejected from Scripture.](2040099)  
[The true doctrine. Creation out of nothing, of God's lavish bounty of
being. Man created above the rest, but incapable of independent
perseverance. Hence the exceptional and supra-natural gift of being in
God's Image, with the promise of bliss conditionally upon his
perseverance in grace.](2040100)  
[Our creation and God's Incarnation most intimately connected. As by the
Word man was called from non-existence into being, and further received
the grace of a divine life, so by the one fault which forfeited that
life they again incurred corruption and untold sin and misery filled the
world.](2040101)  
[For God has not only made us out of nothing; but He gave us freely, by
the Grace of the Word, a life in correspondence with God.](2040102)  
[The human race then was wasting, God's image was being effaced, and His
work ruined. Either, then, God must forego His spoken word by which man
had incurred ruin; or that which had shared in the being of the Word
must sink back again into destruction, in which case God's design would
be defeated. What then? was God's goodness to suffer this? But if so,
why had man been made? It could have been weakness, not goodness on
God's part.](2040103)  
[On the other hand there was the consistency of God's nature, not to be
sacrificed for our profit. Were men, then, to be called upon to repent?
But repentance cannot avert the execution of a law; still less can it
remedy a fallen nature. We have incurred corruption and need to be
restored to the Grace of God's Image. None could renew but He Who had
created. He alone could (1) recreate all, (2) suffer for all, (3)
represent all to the Father.](2040104)  
[The Word, then, visited that earth in which He was yet always present ;
and saw all these evils. He takes a body of our Nature, and that of a
spotless Virgin, in whose womb He makes it His own, wherein to reveal
Himself, conquer death, and restore life.](2040105)  
[The Word, since death alone could stay the plague, took a mortal body
which, united with Him, should avail for all, and by partaking of His
immortality stay the corruption of the Race. By being above all, He made
His Flesh an offering for our souls; by being one with us all, he
clothed us with immortality. Simile to illustrate this.](2040106)  
[By a like simile, the reasonableness of the work of redemption is
shewn. How Christ wiped away our ruin, and provided its antidote by His
own teaching. Scripture proofs of the Incarnation of the Word, and of
the Sacrifice He wrought.](2040107)  
[Second reason for the Incarnation. God, knowing that man was not by
nature sufficient to know Him, gave him, in order that he might have
some profit in being, a knowledge of Himself. He made them in the Image
of the Word, that thus they might know the Word, and through Him the
Father. Yet man, despising this, fell into idolatry, leaving the unseen
God for magic and astrology; and all this in spite of God's manifold
revelation of Himself.](2040108)  
[For though man was created in grace, God, foreseeing his forgetfulness,
provided also the works of creation to remind man of him. Yet further,
He ordained a Law and Prophets, whose ministry was meant for all the
world. Yet men heeded only their own lusts.](2040109)  
[Here again, was God to keep silence? to allow to false gods the worship
He made us to render to Himself? A king whose subjects had revolted
would, after sending letters and messages, go to them in person. How
much more shall God restore in us the grace of His image. This men,
themselves but copies, could not do. Hence the Word Himself must come
(1) to recreate, (2) to destroy death in the Body.](2040110)  
[A portrait once effaced must be restored from the original. Thus the
Son of the Father came to seek, save, and regenerate. No other way was
possible. Blinded himself, man could not see to heal. The witness of
creation had failed to preserve him, and could not bring him back. The
Word alone could do so. But how? Only by revealing Himself as
Man.](2040111)  
[Thus the Word condescended to man's engrossment in corporeal things, by
even taking a body. All man's superstitions He met halfway; whether men
were inclined to worship Nature, Man, Demons, or the dead, He shewed
Himself Lord of all these.](2040112)  
[He came then to attract man's sense-bound attention to Himself as man,
and so to lead him on to know Him as God.](2040113)  
[How the Incarnation did not limit the ubiquity of the Word, nor
diminish His Purity. (Simile of the Sun.)](2040114)  
[How the Word and Power of God works in His human actions: by casting
out devils, by Miracles, by His Birth of the Virgin.](2040115)  
[Man, unmoved by nature, was to be taught to know God by that sacred
Manhood, Whose deity all nature confessed, especially in His
Death.](2040116)  
[None, then, could bestow incorruption, but He Who had made, none
restore the likeness of God, save His Own Image, none quicken, but the
Life, none teach, but the Word. And He, to pay our debt of death, must
also die for us, and rise again as our first-fruits from the grave.
Mortal therefore His Body must be; corruptible, His Body could not
be.](2040117)  
[Death brought to nought by the death of Christ. Why then did not Christ
die privately, or in a more honourable way? He was not subject to
natural death, but had to die at the hands of others. Why then did He
die? Nay but for that purpose He came, and but for that, He could not
have risen.](2040118)  
[But why did He not withdraw His body from the Jews, and so guard its
immortality? (1) It became Him not to inflict death on Himself, and yet
not to shun it. (2) He came to receive death as the due of others,
therefore it should come to Him from without. (3) His death must be
certain, to guarantee the truth of His Resurrection. Also, He could not
die from infirmity, lest He should be mocked in His healing of
others.](2040119)  
[Necessity of a public death for the doctrine of the
Resurrection.](2040120)  
[Further objections anticipated. He did not choose His manner of death;
for He was to prove Conqueror of death in all or any of its forms:
(simile of a good wrestler). The death chosen to disgrace Him proved the
Trophy against death: moreover it preserved His body
undivided.](2040121)  
[Why the Cross, of all deaths? (1) He had to bear the curse for us. (2)
On it He held out His hands to unite all, Jews and Gentiles, in Himself.
(3) He defeated the “Prince of the powers of the air” in His own region,
clearing the way to heaven and opening for us the everlasting
doors.](2040122)  
[Reasons for His rising on the Third Day. (1) Not sooner for else His
real death would be denied, nor (2) later; to (a) guard the identity of
His body, (b) not to keep His disciples too long in suspense, nor (c) to
wait till the witnesses of His death were dispersed, or its memory
faded.](2040123)  
[The change wrought by the Cross in the relation of Death to
Man.](2040124)  
[This exceptional fact must be tested by experience. Let those who doubt
it become Christians.](2040125)  
[Here then are wonderful effects, and a sufficient cause, the Cross, to
account for them, as sunrise accounts for daylight.](2040126)  
[The reality of the resurrection proved by facts: (1) the victory over
death described above: (2) the Wonders of Grace are the work of One
Living, of One who is God: (3) if the gods be (as alleged) real and
living, a fortiori He Who shatters their power is alive.](2040127)  
[If Power is the sign of life, what do we learn from the impotence of
idols, for good or evil, and the constraining power of Christ and of the
Sign of the Cross? Death and the demons are by this proved to have lost
their sovereignty. Coincidence of the above argument from facts with
that from the Personality of Christ.](2040128)  
[But who is to see Him risen, so as to believe? Nay, God is ever
invisible and known by His works only: and here the works cry out in
proof. If you do not believe, look at those who do, and perceive the
Godhead of Christ. The demons see this, though men be blind. Summary of
the argument so far.](2040129)  
[Unbelief of Jews and scoffing of Greeks. The former confounded by their
own Scriptures. Prophecies of His coming as God and as Man.](2040130)  
[Prophecies of His passion and death in all its
circumstances.](2040131)  
[Prophecies of the Cross. How these prophecies are satisfied in Christ
alone.](2040132)  
[Prophecies of Christ's sovereignty, flight into Egypt, &c.](2040133)  
[Psalm xxii. 16, &c. Majesty of His birth and death. Confusion of
oracles and demons in Egypt.](2040134)  
[Other clear prophecies of the coming of God in the flesh. Christ's
miracles unprecedented.](2040135)  
[Do you look for another? But Daniel foretells the exact time.
Objections to this removed.](2040136)  
[Argument (1) from the withdrawal of prophecy and destruction of
Jerusalem, (2) from the conversion of the Gentiles, and that to the God
of Moses. What more remains for the Messiah to do, that Christ has not
done?](2040137)  
[Answer to the Greeks. Do they recognise the Logos? If He manifests
Himself in the organism of the Universe, why not in one Body? for a
human body is a part of the same whole.](2040138)  
[His union with the body is based upon His relation to Creation as a
whole. He used a human body, since to man it was that He wished to
reveal Himself.](2040139)  
[He came in human rather than in any nobler form, because (I) He came to
save, not to impress ; (2) man alone of creatures had sinned. As men
would not recognise His works in the Universe, He came and worked among
them as Man; in the sphere to which they had limited
themselves.](2040140)  
[As God made man by a word, why not restore him by a word? But (1)
creation out of nothing is different from reparation of what already
exists. (2) Man was there with a definite need, calling for a definite
remedy. Death was ingrained in man's nature: He then must wind life
closely to human nature. Therefore the Word became Incarnate that He
might meet and conquer death in His usurped territory. (Simile of straw
and asbestos.)](2040141)  
[Thus once again every part of creation manifests the glory of God.
Nature, the witness to her Creator, yields (by miracles) a second
testimony to God Incarnate. The witness of Nature, perverted by man's
sin, was thus forced back to truth. If these reasons suffice not, let
the Greeks look at facts.](2040142)  
[Discredit, from the date of the Incarnation, of idol-cultus, oracles,
mythologies, demoniacal energy, magic, and Gentile philosophy. And
whereas the old cults were strictly local and independent, the worship
of Christ is catholic and uniform.](2040143)  
[The numerous oracles,--fancied apparitions in sacred places, &c.,
dispelled by the sign of the Cross. The old gods prove to have been mere
men. Magic is exposed. And whereas Philosophy could only persuade select
and local cliques of Immortality, and goodness,--men of little intellect
have infused into the multitudes of the churches the principle of a
supernatural life.](2040144)  
[Further facts. Christian continence of virgins and ascetics. Martyrs.
The power of the Cross against demons and magic. Christ by His Power
shews Himself more than a man, more than a magician, more than a spirit.
For all these are totally subject to Him. Therefore He is the Word of
God.](2040145)  
[His Birth and Miracles. You call Asclepius, Heracles, and Dionysus gods
for their works. Contrast their works with His, and the wonders at His
death, &c.](2040146)  
[Impotence and rivalries of the Sophists put to shame by the Death of
Christ. His Resurrection unparalleled even in Greek legend.](2040147)  
[The new virtue of continence. Revolution of Society, purified and
pacified by Christianity.](2040148)  
[Wars, &c., roused by demons, lulled by Christianity.](2040149)  
[The whole fabric of Gentilism levelled at a blow by Christ secretly
addressing the conscience of Man.](2040150)  
[The Word Incarnate, as is the case with the Invisible God, is known to
us by His works. By them we recognise His deifying mission. Let us be
content to enumerate a few of them, leaving their dazzling plentitude to
him who will behold.](2040151)  
[Summary of foregoing. Cessation of pagan oracles, &c.: propagation of
the faith. The true King has come forth and silenced all
usurpers.](2040152)  
[Search then, the Scriptures, if you can, and so fill up this sketch.
Learn to look for the Second Advent and Judgment.](2040153)  
[Above all, so live that you may have the right to eat of this tree of
knowledge and life, and so come to eternal joys. Doxology.](2040154)

[Introduction.](2040197)  
[De Decretis. (Defence of the Nicene Definition.)](2040198)  
[Chapter I](2040199)  
[Conduct of the Arians towards the Nicene Council. Ignorant as well as
irreligious to attempt to reverse an Ecumenical Council: proceedings at
Nicæa: Eusebians then signed what they now complain of: on the unanimity
of true teachers and the process of tradition: changes of the
Arians.](2040200)  
[Two senses of the word Son, 1. adoptive; 2. essential; attempts of
Arians to find a third meaning between these; e.g. that our Lord only
was created immediately by God (Asterius's view), or that our Lord alone
partakes the Father. The second and true sense; God begets as He makes,
really; though His creation and generation are not like man's; His
generation independent of time; generation implies an internal, and
therefore an eternal, act in God; explanation of Prov. viii.
22.](2040201)  
[Proof of the Catholic Sense of the Word Son. Power, Word or Reason, and
Wisdom, the names of the Son, imply eternity; as well as the Father's
title of Fountain. The Arians reply, that these do not formally belong
to the essence of the Son, but are names given Him; that God has many
words, powers, &c. Why there is but one Son and Word, &c. All the titles
of the Son coincide in Him.](2040202)  
[Defence of the Council's Phrases, “from the essence,” And “one in
essence.” Objection that the phrases are not scriptural; we ought to
look at the sense more than the wording; evasion of the Arians as to the
phrase “of God” which is in Scripture; their evasion of all explanations
but those which the Council selected, which were intended to negative
the Arian formulæ; protest against their conveying any material
sense.](2040203)  
[Authorities in Support of the Council. Theognostus; Dionysius of
Alexandria; Dionysius of Rome; Origen.](2040204)  
[On the Arian Symbol “Unoriginate.” This term afterwards adopted by
them; and why; three senses of it. A fourth sense. Unoriginate denotes
God in contrast to His creatures, not to His Son; Father the scriptural
title instead; Conclusion.](2040205)

### Against the Arians. (Orationes contra Arianos IV.)

[Against the Arians. (Orationes contra Arianos IV.)](2040342)  
[Introduction.](2040343)  
[Against the Arians. (Orationes contra Arianos IV.)](2040344)  
[Discourse I](2040345)  
[Chapter I](2040346)  
[Extracts from the Thalia of Arius. Arius maintains that God became a
Father, and the Son was not always; the Son out of nothing; once He was
not; He was not before his generation; He was created; named Wisdom and
Word after God's attributes; made that He might make us; one out of many
powers of God; alterable; exalted on God's foreknowledge of what He was
to be; not very God; but called so as others by participation; foreign
in essence from the Father; does not know or see the Father; does not
know Himself.](2040347)  
[The Importance of the Subject. The Arians affect Scripture language,
but their doctrine new, as well as unscriptural. Statement of the
Catholic doctrine, that the Son is proper to the Father's substance, and
eternal. Restatement of Arianism in contrast, that He is a creature with
a beginning: the controversy comes to this issue, whether one whom we
are to believe in as God, can be so in name only, and is merely a
creature. What pretence then for being indifferent in the controversy?
The Arians rely on state patronage, and dare not avow their
tenets.](2040348)  
[That the Son is Eternal and Increate. These attributes, being the
points in dispute, are first proved by direct texts of Scripture.
Concerning the 'eternal power' of God in Rom. i. 20, which is shewn to
mean the Son. Remarks on the Arian formula, 'Once the Son was not,' its
supporters not daring to speak of 'a time when the Son was
not.'](2040349)  
[Subject Continued. Objection, that the Son's eternity makes Him
coordinate with the Father, introduces the subject of His Divine
Sonship, as a second proof of His eternity. The word Son is introduced
in a secondary, but is to be understood in real sense. Since all things
partake of the Father in partaking of the Son, He is the whole
participation of the Father, that is, He is the Son by nature; for to be
wholly participated is to beget.](2040350)  
[Subject Continued. Third proof of the Son's eternity, viz. from other
titles indicative of His coessentiality; as the Creator; One of the
Blessed Trinity; as Wisdom; as Word; as Image. If the Son is a perfect
Image of the Father, why is He not a Father also? because God, being
perfect, is not the origin of a race. Only the Father a Father because
the Only Father, only the Son a Son because the Only Son. Men are not
really fathers and really sons, but shadows of the True. The Son does
not become a Father, because He has received from the Father to be
immutable and ever the same.](2040351)  
[Objections to the Foregoing Proof. Whether, in the generation of the
Son, God made One that was already, or One that was not.](2040352)  
[Objections Continued. Whether we may decide the question by the
parallel of human sons, which are born later than their parents. No, for
the force of the analogy lies in the idea of connaturality. Time is not
involved in the idea of Son, but is adventitious to it, and does not
attach to God, because He is without parts and passions. The titles Word
and Wisdom guard our thoughts of Him and His Son from this
misconception. God not a Father, as a Creator, in posse from eternity,
because creation does not relate to the essence of God, as generation
does.](2040353)  
[Objections Continued. Whether is the Unoriginate one or two?
Inconsistent in Arians to use an unscriptural word; necessary to define
its meaning. Different senses of the word. If it means 'without Father,'
there is but One Unoriginate; if 'without beginning or creation,' there
are two. Inconsistency of Asterius. 'Unoriginate' a title of God, not in
contrast with the Son, but with creatures, as is 'Almighty,' or 'Lord of
powers.' 'Father' is the truer title, as not only Scriptural, but
implying a Son, and our adoption as sons.](2040354)  
[Objections Continued. How the Word has free will, yet without being
alterable. He is unalterable because the Image of the Father, proved
from texts.](2040355)  
[Texts Explained; And First, Phil. II. 9, 10. Various texts which are
alleged against the Catholic doctrine: e.g. Phil. ii. 9, 10. Whether the
words 'Wherefore God hath highly exalted' prove moral probation and
advancement. Argued against, first, from the force of the word 'Son;'
which is inconsistent with such an interpretation. Next, the passage
examined. Ecclesiastical sense of 'highly exalted,' and 'gave,' and
'wherefore;' viz. as being spoken with reference to our Lord's manhood.
Secondary sense; viz. as implying the Word's 'exaltation' through the
resurrection in the same sense in which Scripture speaks of His descent
in the Incarnation; how the phrase does not derogate from the nature of
the Word.](2040356)  
[Texts Explained; Secondly, Psalm xlv. 7, 8. Whether the words
'therefore,' 'anointed,' &c., imply that the Word has been rewarded.
Argued against first from the word 'fellows' or 'partakers.' He is
anointed with the Spirit in His manhood to sanctify human nature.
Therefore the Spirit descended on Him in Jordan, when in the flesh. And
He is said to sanctify Himself for us, and give us the glory He has
received. The word 'wherefore' implies His divinity. 'Thou hast loved
righteousness,' &c., do not imply trial or choice.](2040357)  
[Texts Explained; Thirdly, Hebrews i. 4. Additional texts brought as
objections; e.g. Heb. i. 4; vii. 22. Whether the word 'better' implies
likeness to the Angels; and 'made' or 'become' implies creation.
Necessary to consider the circumstances under which Scripture speaks.
Difference between 'better' and 'greater;' texts in proof. 'Made' or
'become' a general word. Contrast in Heb. i. 4, between the Son and the
Works in point of nature. The difference of the punishments under the
two Covenants shews the difference of the natures of the Son and the
Angels. 'Become' relates not to the nature of the Word, but to His
manhood and office and relation towards us. Parallel passages in which
the term is applied to the Eternal Father.](2040358)  
[Excursus B. On §22 (Note 3).](2040359)  
[Discourse II](2040360)  
[Chapter XIV](2040361)  
[Texts explained; Fifthly, Acts ii. 36. The Regula Fidei must be
observed; made applies to our Lord's manhood; and to His manifestation;
and to His office relative to us; and is relative to the Jews. Parallel
instance in Gen. xxvii. 29, 37. The context contradicts the Arian
interpretation.](2040362)  
[Chapter XVI.--Introductory to Proverbs viii. 22, that the Son is not a
Creature. Arian formula, a creature but not as one of the creatures; but
each creature is unlike all other creatures; and no creature can create.
The Word then differs from all creatures in that in which they, though
otherwise differing, all agree together, as creatures; viz. in being an
efficient cause; in being the one medium or instrumental agent in
creation; moreover in being the revealer of the Father; and in being the
object of worship.](2040363)  
[Introduction to Proverbs viii. 22 continued. Absurdity of supposing a
Son or Word created in order to the creation of other creatures; as to
the creation being unable to bear God's immediate hand, God condescends
to the lowest. Moreover, if the Son a creature, He too could not bear
God's hand, and an infinite series of media will be necessary. Objected,
that, as Moses who led out the Israelites was a man, so our Lord; but
Moses was not the Agent in creation:--again, that unity is found in
created ministrations, but all such ministrations are defective and
dependent:--again, that He learned to create, yet could God's Wisdom
need teaching? and why should He learn, if the Father worketh hitherto?
If the Son was created to create us, He is for our sake, not we for
His.](2040364)  
[Introduction to Proverbs viii. 22 continued. Contrast between the
Father's operations immediately and naturally in the Son, instrumentally
by the creatures; Scripture terms illustrative of this. Explanation of
these illustrations; which should be interpreted by the doctrine of the
Church; perverse sense put on them by the Arians, refuted. Mystery of
Divine Generation. Contrast between God's Word and man's word drawn out
at length. Asterius betrayed into holding two Unoriginates; his
inconsistency. Baptism how by the Son as well as by the Father. On the
Baptism of heretics. Why Arian worse than other heresies.](2040365)  
[Texts explained; Sixthly, Proverbs viii. 22. Proverbs are of a
figurative nature, and must be interpreted as such. We must interpret
them, and in particular this passage, by the Regula Fidei. 'He created
me' not equivalent to 'I am a creature.' Wisdom a creature so far forth
as Its human body. Again, if He is a creature, it is as 'a beginning of
ways,' an office which, though not an attribute, is a consequence, of a
higher and divine nature. And it is 'for the works,' which implied the
works existed, and therefore much more He, before He was created. Also
'the Lord' not the Father 'created' Him, which implies the creation was
that of a servant.](2040366)  
[Texts Explained; Sixthly, Proverbs viii. 22 Continued. Our Lord is said
to be created 'for the works,' i.e. with a particular purpose, which no
mere creatures are ever said to be. Parallel of Isai. xlix. 5, &c. When
His manhood is spoken of, a reason for it is added; not so when His
Divine Nature; Texts in proof.](2040367)  
[Texts Explained; Sixthly, Proverbs viii. 22, Continued. Our Lord not
said in Scripture to be 'created,' or the works to be 'begotten.' 'In
the beginning' means in the case of the works 'from the beginning.'
Scripture passages explained. We are made by God first, begotten next;
creatures by nature, sons by grace. Christ begotten first, made or
created afterwards. Sense of 'First-born of the dead;' of 'First-born
among many brethren;' of 'First-born of all creation,' contrasted with
'Only-begotten.' Further interpretation of 'beginning of ways,' and 'for
the works.' Why a creature could not redeem; why redemption was
necessary at all. Texts which contrast the Word and the
works.](2040368)  
[Texts Explained; Sixthly, the Context of Proverbs viii. 22 Vz. 22-30.
It is right to interpret this passage by the Regula Fidei. 'Founded' is
used in contrast to superstructure; and it implies, as in the case of
stones in building, previous existence. 'Before the world' signifies the
divine intention and purpose. Recurrence to Prov. viii. 22, and
application of it to created Wisdom as seen in the works. The Son
reveals the Father, first by the works, then by the
Incarnation.](2040369)  
[Discourse III](2040370)  
[Chapter XXIII](2040371)  
[Texts Explained; Eighthly, John xvii. 3. and the Like. Our Lord's
divinity cannot interfere with His Father's prerogatives, as the One
God, which were so earnestly upheld by the Son. 'One' is used in
contrast to false gods and idols, not to the Son, through whom the
Father spoke. Our Lord adds His Name to the Father's, as included in
Him. The Father the First, not as if the Son were not First too, but as
Origin.](2040372)  
[Texts Explained; Ninthly, John x. 30; xvii. 11, &c. Arian explanation,
that the Son is one with the Father in will and judgment; but so are all
good men, nay things inanimate; contrast of the Son. Oneness between
Them is in nature, because oneness in operation. Angels not objects of
prayer, because they do not work together with God, but the Son; texts
quoted. Seeing an Angel, is not seeing God. Arians in fact hold two
Gods, and tend to Gentile polytheism. Arian explanation that the Father
and Son are one as we are one with Christ, is put aside by the Regula
Fidei, and shewn invalid by the usage of Scripture in illustrations; the
true force of the comparison; force of the terms used. Force of 'in us;'
force of 'as;' confirmed by S. John. In what sense we are 'in God' and
His 'sons.'](2040373)  
[Introductory to Texts from the Gospels on the Incarnation. Enumeration
of texts still to be explained. Arians compared to the Jews. We must
recur to the Regula Fidei. Our Lord did not come into, but became, man,
and therefore had the acts and affections of the flesh. The same works
divine and human. Thus the flesh was purified, and men were made
immortal. Reference to I Pet. iv. 1.](2040374)  
[Texts Explained; Tenthly, Matthew xi. 27; John iii. 35, &c. These texts
intended to preclude the Sabellian notion of the Son; they fall in with
the Catholic doctrine concerning the Son; they are explained by 'so' in
John v. 26. (Anticipation of the next chapter.) Again they are used with
reference to our Lord's human nature; for our sake, that we might
receive and not lose, as receiving in Him. And consistently with other
parts of Scripture, which shew that He had the power, &c., before He
received it. He was God and man, and His actions are often at once
divine and human.](2040375)  
[Texts Explained; Eleventhly, Mark xiii. 32 and Luke ii. 52. Arian
explanation of the former text is against the Regula Fidei; and against
the context. Our Lord said He was ignorant of the Day, by reason of His
human nature. If the Holy Spirit knows the Day, therefore the Son knows;
if the Son knows the Father, therefore He knows the Day; if He has all
that is the Father's, therefore knowledge of the Day; if in the Father,
He knows the Day in the Father; if He created and upholds all things, He
knows when they will cease to be. He knows not as Man, argued from Matt.
xxiv. 42. As He asked about Lazarus's grave, &c., yet knew, so He knows;
as S. Paul says, 'whether in the body I know not,' &c., yet knew, so He
knows. He said He knew not for our profit, that we be not curious (as in
Acts i. 7, where on the contrary He did not say He knew not). As the
Almighty asks of Adam and of Cain, yet knew, so the Son knows\[as God\].
Again, He advanced in wisdom also as man, else He made Angels perfect
before Himself. He adva](2040376)  
[Texts Explained; Twelfthly, Matthew xxvi. 39; John xii. 27, &c. Arian
inferences are against the Regula Fidei, as before. He wept and the
like, as man. Other texts prove Him God. God could not fear. He feared
because His flesh feared.](2040377)  
[Objections continued, as in Chapters vii.--x. Whether the Son is
begotten of the Father's will? This virtually the same as whether once
He was not? and used by the Arians to introduce the latter question. The
Regula Fidei answers it at once in the negative by contrary texts. The
Arians follow the Valentinians in maintaining a precedent will; which
really is only exercised by God towards creatures. Instances from
Scripture. Inconsistency of Asterius. If the Son by will, there must be
another Word before Him. If God is good, or exist, by His will, then is
the Son by His will. If He willed to have reason or wisdom, then is His
Word and Wisdom at His will. The Son is the Living Will, and has all
titles which denote connaturality. That will which the Father has to the
Son, the Son has to the Father. The Father wills the Son and the Son
wills the Father.](2040378)
