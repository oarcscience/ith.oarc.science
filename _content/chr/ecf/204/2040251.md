cruel. But the rest who came to him he so instructed that they
straightway forgot their lawsuits, and felicitated those who were in
retirement from the world. And he championed those who were wronged in
such a way that you would imagine that he, and not the others, was the
sufferer. Further, he was able to be of such use to all, that many
soldiers and men who had great possessions laid aside the burdens of
life, and became monks for the rest of their days. And it was as if a
physician had been given by God to Egypt. For who in grief met Antony
and did not return rejoicing? Who came mourning for his dead and did not
forthwith put off his sorrow? Who came in anger and was not converted to
friendship? What poor and low-spirited man met him who, hearing him and
looking upon him, did not despise wealth and console himself in his
poverty? What monk, having being neglectful, came to him and became not
all the stronger? What young man having come to the mountain and seen
Antony, did not forthwith deny himself pleasure and love temperance? Who
when tempted by a demon, came to him and did not find rest? And who came
troubled with doubts and did not get quietness of mind?
