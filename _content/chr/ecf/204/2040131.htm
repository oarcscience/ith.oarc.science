<p class="c11"><a name="vii.ii.xxxiv-p2"></A>Nor is even His death passed over in silence: on the contrary, it is referred to in the divine Scriptures, even exceeding clearly. For to the end that none should err for want of instruction in the actual events, they feared not to mention even the cause of His death,&#8212;that He suffers it not for His own sake, but for the immortality and salvation of all, and the counsels of the Jews against Him and the indignities offered Him at their hands. 2. They say then: &#8220;A man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_286"></A><A HREF="#fn_286"><FONT SIZE="1">287</FONT></A>
 in stripes, and knowing how to bear weakness, for his face is turned away: he was dishonoured and held in no account. He beareth our sins, and is in pain on our account; and we reckoned him to be in labour, and in stripes, and in ill-usage; but he was wounded for our sins, and made weak for our wickedness. The chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his stripes we were healed.&#8221; O marvel at the loving-kindness of the Word, that for our sakes He is dishonoured, that we may be brought to honour. &#8220;For all we,&#8221; it says, &#8220;like sheep were gone astray; man had erred in his way; and the Lord delivered him for our sins; and he openeth not his mouth, because he hath been evilly entreated. As a sheep was he brought to the slaughter, and as a lamb dumb before his shearer, so openeth he not his mouth: in his abasement his judgment was taken away&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_287"></A><A HREF="#fn_287"><FONT SIZE="1">288</FONT></A>
.&#8221; 3. Then lest any should from His suffering conceive Him to be a common man, Holy Writ anticipates the surmises of man, and declares the power (which worked) for Him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_288"></A><A HREF="#fn_288"><FONT SIZE="1">289</FONT></A>
, and the difference of His nature compared with ourselves, saying: &#8220;But who shall declare his generation? For his life is taken away&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_289"></A><A HREF="#fn_289"><FONT SIZE="1">290</FONT></A>
 from the earth. From the wickedness of the people was he brought to death. And I will give the wicked instead of his burial, and the rich instead of his death; for he did no wickedness, neither was guile found in his mouth. And the Lord will cleanse him from his stripes.&#8221;</p>

Mr. E. N.

I would add the suggestion that <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.ii.xxxiv-p5.16"></A>&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> stood after <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.ii.xxxiv-p5.18"></A>&#8017;</span><span class="Greek"><a name="vii.ii.xxxiv-p5.19"></A>&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8049;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span>, and that the similarity of the five letters in <span class="c10"><a name="vii.ii.xxxiv-p5.21"></A>ms.</span> caused the second word to be dropped out. <i>&#145;His</i> exceeding immaterial power&#146; would be the resulting sense.
