<p class="c41"><a name="vii.ii.xl-p1"></A>  &sect;40. <i>Argument (1) from the withdrawal of prophecy and destruction of Jerusalem, (2) from the conversion of the Gentiles, and that to the God of Moses. What more remains for the Messiah to do, that Christ has not done?</i></p>  
<p class="c11"><a name="vii.ii.xl-p2"></A>So the Jews are trifling, and the time in question, which they refer to the future, is actually come. For when did prophet and vision cease from Israel, save when Christ came, the Holy of Holies? For it is a sign, and an important proof, of the coming of the Word of God, that Jerusalem no longer stands, nor is any prophet raised up nor vision revealed to them,&#8212;and that very naturally. 2. For when He that was signified was come, what need was there any longer of any to signify Him? When the truth was there, what need any more of the shadow? For this was the reason of their prophesying at all,&#8212;namely, till the true Righteousness should come, and He that was to ransom the sins of all. And this was why Jerusalem stood till then&#8212;namely, that there they might be exercised in the types as a preparation for the reality. 3. So when the Holy of Holies was come, naturally vision and prophecy were sealed and the kingdom of Jerusalem ceased. For kings were to be anointed among them only until the Holy of Holies should have been anointed; and Jacob prophesies that the kingdom of the Jews should be established until Him, as follows:&#8212;&#8220;The ruler&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_304"></A><A HREF="#fn_304"><FONT SIZE="1">305</FONT></A>
 shall not fail from Juda, nor the Prince from his loins, until that which is laid up for him shall come; and he is the expectation of the nations.&#8221; 4. Whence the Saviour also Himself cried aloud and said: &#8220;The&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_305"></A><A HREF="#fn_305"><FONT SIZE="1">306</FONT></A>
 law and the prophets prophesied until John.&#8221; If then there is now among the Jews <A NAME="page_58"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 58</FONT></A> <a name="vii.ii.xl-Page_58"></A>king or prophet or vision, they do well to deny the Christ that is come. But if there is neither king nor vision, but from that time forth all prophecy is sealed and the city and temple taken, why are they so irreligious and so perverse as to see what has happened, and yet to deny Christ, Who has brought it all to pass? Or why, when they see even heathens deserting their idols, and placing their hope, through Christ, on the God of Israel, do they deny Christ, Who was born of the root of Jesse after the flesh and henceforth is King? For if the nations were worshipping some other God, and not confessing the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and Moses, then, once more, they would be doing well in alleging that God had not come. 5. But if the Gentiles are honouring the same God that gave the law to Moses and made the promise to Abraham, and Whose word the Jews dishonoured,&#8212;why are they ignorant, or rather why do they choose to ignore, that the Lord foretold by the Scriptures has shone forth upon the world, and appeared to it in bodily form, as the Scripture said: &#8220;The&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_306"></A><A HREF="#fn_306"><FONT SIZE="1">307</FONT></A>
 Lord God hath shined upon us;&#8221; and again: &#8220;He&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_307"></A><A HREF="#fn_307"><FONT SIZE="1">308</FONT></A>
 sent His Word and healed them;&#8221; and again: &#8220;Not&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_308"></A><A HREF="#fn_308"><FONT SIZE="1">309</FONT></A>
 a messenger, not an angel, but the Lord Himself saved them?&#8221; 6. Their state may be compared to that of one out of his right mind, who sees the earth illumined by the sun, but denies the sun that illumines it. For what more is there for him whom they expect to do, when he is come? To call the heathen? But they are called already. To make prophecy, and king, and vision to cease? This too has already come to pass. To expose the godlessness of idolatry? It is already exposed and condemned. Or to destroy death? He is already destroyed. 7. What then has not come to pass, that the Christ must do? What is left unfulfilled, that the Jews should now disbelieve with impunity? For if, I say,&#8212;which is just what we actually see,&#8212;there is no longer king nor prophet nor Jerusalem nor sacrifice nor vision among them, but even the whole earth is filled with the knowledge of God, and Gentiles, leaving their godlessness, are now taking refuge with the God of Abraham, through the Word, even our Lord Jesus Christ, then it must be plain, even to those who are exceedingly obstinate, that the Christ is come, and that He has illumined absolutely all with His light, and given them the true and divine teaching concerning His Father. 8. So one can fairly refute the Jews by these and by other arguments from the Divine Scriptures.</p>
