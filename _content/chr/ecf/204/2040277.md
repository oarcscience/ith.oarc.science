<span id="xviii.ii.xii-p1"></span> 12. *Truth the defence of Thrones.*

<span id="xviii.ii.xii-p2"></span>Had I been accused before any other, I
should have appealed to your Piety; as once the Apostle appealed unto
Cæsar, and put an end to the designs of his enemies against him. But
since they have had the boldness to lay their charge before you, to whom
shall I appeal from you? to the Father of Him who says, ‘I am the
Truth <span id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321) ,’ that He may incline
your heart into clemency:—

<span id="xviii.ii.xii-p4"></span>O Lord Almighty, and King of eternity,
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who by Thy Word hast given this
Kingdom to Thy servant Constantius; do Thou shine into his heart, that
he, knowing the falsehood that is set against me, may both favourably
receive this my defence; and may make known unto all men, that his ears
are firmly set to hearken unto the Truth, according as it is written,
‘Righteous lips alone are acceptable unto the King <span
id="fr_1322"></span>[1323](#fn_1322) .’ For Thou hast caused it to be
said by Solomon, that thus the throne of the kingdom shall be
established.

<span id="xviii.ii.xii-p6"></span>Wherefore at least enquire into this
matter, and let the accusers understand that your desire is to learn the
truth; and see, whether they will not shew their falsehood by their very
looks; for the countenance is a test of the conscience as it is written,
‘A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance, but by sorrow of the heart
the spirit is broken <span id="fr_1323"></span>[1324](#fn_1323) .’ Thus
they who had conspired against Joseph <span
id="fr_1324"></span>[1325](#fn_1324) were convicted by their own
consciences; and the craft of Laban towards Jacob was shewn in his
countenance <span id="fr_1325"></span>[1326](#fn_1325) . And thus you
see the suspicious alarm of these persons, for they fly and hide
themselves; but on our part frankness in making our defence. And the
question between us is not one regarding worldly wealth, but concerning
the honour of the Church. He that has been struck by a stone, applies to
a physician; but sharper than a stone are the strokes of calumny; for as
Solomon has said, ‘A false witness is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp
arrow <span id="fr_1326"></span>[1327](#fn_1326) ,’ and its wounds Truth
alone is able to cure; and if Truth be set at nought, they grow worse
and worse.
