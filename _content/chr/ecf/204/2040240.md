<span id="xvi.ii.xxix-p1"></span> 67. Added to this he was tolerant in
disposition and humble in spirit. For though he was such a man, he
observed the rule of the Church most rigidly, and was willing that all
the clergy should be honoured above himself <span
id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112) . For he was not ashamed to bow his
head to bishops and presbyters, and if ever a deacon came to him for
help he discoursed with him on what was profitable, but gave place to
him in prayer, not being ashamed to learn himself. For often he would
ask questions, and desired to listen to those who were present, and if
any one said anything that was useful he confessed that he was profited.
And besides, his countenance had a great and wonderful grace. This gift
also he had from the Saviour. For if he were present in a great company
of monks, and any one who did not know him previously, wished to see
him, immediately coming forward he passed by the rest, and hurried to
Antony, as though attracted by his appearance. Yet neither in height nor
breadth was he conspicuous above others, but in the serenity of his
manner and the purity of his soul. For as his soul was free from
disturbances, his outward appearance was calm; so from the joy of his
soul he possessed a cheerful countenance, and from his bodily movements
could be perceived the condition of his soul, as it is written, ‘When
the heart is merry the countenance is cheerful, but when it is sorrowful
it is cast down <span id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113) .’ Thus Jacob
recognised the counsel Laban had in his heart, and said to his wives,
‘The countenance of your father is not as it was yesterday and the day
before <span id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114) .’ Thus Samuel
recognised David, for he had mirthful eyes, and teeth white as milk.
Thus Antony was recognised, for he was never disturbed, for his soul was
at peace; he was never downcast, for his mind was joyous.

<span id="xvi.ii.xxix-p2"></span> This was by no means universal among
monks: Athan. argues to Dracontius (cc. 8, 9) against the monastic
tendency to think little of the clergy. Here, he propounds the example
of Antony for the imitation of the ‘peregrini fratres.’
