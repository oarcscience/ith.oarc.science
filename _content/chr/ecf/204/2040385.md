<span id="xxi.ii.vi.v"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii.vi.v-p1"></span> *§§11, 12. Marcellus and his
disciples, like Arians, say that the Word was, not indeed created, but
issued, to create us, as if the Divine silence were a state of inaction,
and when God spake by the Word, He acted; or that there was a going
forth and return of the Word; a doctrine which implies change and
imperfection in Father and Son.*

<span id="xxi.ii.vi.v-p2"></span>11. They fall into the same folly with
the Arians; for Arians also say that He was created for us, that He
might create us, as if God waited till our creation for His issue, as
the one party say, or His creation, as the <span id="page_437">p.
437</span> <span id="xxi.ii.vi.v-Page_437"></span>other. Arians then are
more bountiful to us than to the Son; for they say, not we for His sake,
but He for ours, came to be; that is, if He was therefore created, and
subsisted, that God through Him might create us. And these, as
irreligious or more so, give to God less than to us. For we oftentimes,
even when silent, yet are active in thinking, so as to form the results
of our thoughts into images; but God they would have inactive when
silent, and when He speaks then to exert strength; if, that is, when
silent He could not make, and when speaking He began to create. For it
is just to ask them, whether the Word, when He was in God, was perfect,
so as to be able to make. If on the one hand He was imperfect, when in
God, but by being begotten became perfect <span
id="fr_3321"></span>[3322](#fn_3321) , we are the cause of His
perfection, that is, if He has been begotten for us; for on our behalf
He has received the power of making. But if He was perfect in God, so as
to be able to make, His generation is superfluous; for He, even when in
the Father, could frame the world; so that either He has not been
begotten, or He was begotten, not for us, but because He is ever from
the Father. For His generation evidences, not that we were created, but
that He is from God; for He was even before our creation.

<span id="xxi.ii.vi.v-p4"></span>12. And the same presumption will be
proved against them concerning the Father; for if, when silent, He could
not make, of necessity He has gained power by begetting, that is, by
speaking. And whence has He gained it? and wherefore? If, when He had
the Word within Him, He could make, He begets needlessly, being able to
make even in silence. Next, if the Word was in God before He was
begotten, then being begotten He is without and external to Him. But if
so, how says He now, ‘I in the Father and the Father in Me <span
id="fr_3322"></span>[3323](#fn_3322) ?’ but if He is now in the Father,
then always was He in the Father, as He is now, and needless is it to
say, ‘For us was He begotten, and He reverts after we are formed, that
He may be as He was.’ For He was not anything which He is not now, nor
is He what He was not; but He is as He ever was, and in the same state
and in the same respects; otherwise He will seem to be imperfect and
alterable. For if, what He was, that He shall be afterwards, as if now
He were not so, it is plain, He is not now what He was and shall be. I
mean, if He was before in God, and afterwards shall be again, it follows
that now the Word is not in God. But the Lord refutes such persons when
He says, ‘I in the Father and the Father in Me;’ for so is He now as He
ever was. But if so He now is, as He was ever, it follows, not that at
one time He was begotten and not at another, nor that once there was
silence with God, and then He spake, but there is ever a Father <span
id="fr_3323"></span>[3324](#fn_3323) , and a Son who is His Word, not in
name <span id="fr_3324"></span>[3325](#fn_3324) alone a Word, nor the
Word in notion only a Son, but existing coessential <span
id="fr_3325"></span>[3326](#fn_3325) with the Father, not begotten for
us, for we are brought into being for Him. For, if He were begotten for
us, and in His begetting we were created, and in His generation the
creature consists, and then He returns that He may be what He was
before, first, He that was begotten will be again not begotten. For if
His progression be generation, His return will be the close <span
id="fr_3326"></span>[3327](#fn_3326) of that generation, for when He has
come to be in God, God will be silent again. But if He shall be silent,
there will be what there was when He was silent, stillness and not
creation, for the creation will cease to be. For, as on the Word’s
outgoing, the creation came to be, and existed, so on the Word’s
retiring, the creation will not exist. What use then for it to come into
being, if it is to cease? or why did God speak, that then He should be
silent? and why did He issue One whom He recalls? and why did He beget
One whose generation He willed to cease? Again it is uncertain what He
shall be. For either He will ever be silent, or He will again beget, and
will devise a different creation (for He will not make the same, else
that which was made would have remained, but another); and in due course
He will bring that also to a close, and will devise another, and so on
without end <span id="fr_3327"></span>[3328](#fn_3327) .
