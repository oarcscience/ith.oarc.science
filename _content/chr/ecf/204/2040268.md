<span id="xviii.ii.iii-p1"></span> 3. *He never saw Constans alone.*

<span id="xviii.ii.iii-p2"></span>But in truth I am ashamed even to have
to defend myself against charges such as these, which I do not suppose
that even the accuser himself would venture to make mention of in my
presence. For he knows full well that he speaks untruly, and that I was
never so mad, so reft of my senses, as even to be open to the suspicion
of having conceived any such thing. So that had I been questioned by any
other on this subject, I would not even have answered, lest, while I was
making my defence, my hearers should for a time have suspended their
judgment concerning me. But to your Piety I answer with a loud and clear
voice, and <span id="page_239">p. 239</span> <span
id="xviii.ii.iii-Page_239"></span>stretching forth my hand, as I have
learned from the Apostle, ‘I call God for a record upon my soul <span
id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289) ,’ and as it is written in the
histories of the Kings (let me be allowed to say the same), ‘The Lord is
witness, and His Anointed is witness <span
id="fr_1290"></span>[1291](#fn_1290) ,’ I have never spoken evil of your
Piety before your brother Constans, the most religious Augustus of
blessed memory. I did not exasperate him against you, as these have
falsely accused me. But whenever in my interviews with him he has
mentioned your Grace (and he did mention you at the time that
Thalassus <span id="fr_1291"></span>[1292](#fn_1291) came to Pitybion,
and I was staying at Aquileia), the Lord is witness, how I spoke of your
Piety in terms which I would that God would reveal unto your soul, that
you might condemn the falsehood of these my calumniators. Bear with me,
most gracious Augustus, and freely grant me your indulgence while I
speak of this matter. Your most Christian brother was not a man of so
light a temper, nor was I a person of such a character, that we should
communicate together on a subject like this, or that I should slander a
brother to a brother, or speak evil of an emperor before an emperor. I
am not so mad, Sire, nor have I forgotten that divine utterance which
says, ‘Curse not the king, no, not in thy thought; and curse not the
rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and
that which hath wings shall tell the matter <span
id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292) .’ If then those things, which are
spoken in secret against you that are kings, are not hidden, it is not
incredible that I should have spoken against you in the presence of a
king, and of so many bystanders? For I never saw your brother by myself,
nor did he ever converse with me in private, but I was always introduced
in company with the Bishop of the city where I happened to be, and with
others that chanced to be there. We entered the presence together, and
together we retired. Fortunatian <span
id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293) , Bishop of Aquileia, can testify
this, the father Hosius is able to say the same, as also are Crispinus,
Bishop of Padua, Lucillus of a Verona, Dionysius of Lëis, and Vincentius
of Campania. And although Maximinus of Treveri, and Protasius of Milan,
are dead, yet Eugenius, who was Master of the Palace <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294) , can bear witness for me; for he
stood before the veil <span id="fr_1295"></span>[1296](#fn_1295) , and
heard what we requested of the Emperor, and what he vouchsafed to reply
to us.
