<span id="vii.ii.xv-p1"></span> §15. *Thus the Word condescended to
man’s engrossment in corporeal things, by even taking a body. All man’s
superstitions He met halfway; whether men were inclined to worship
Nature, Man, Demons, or the dead, He shewed Himself Lord of all these.*

<span id="vii.ii.xv-p2"></span>For as a kind teacher who cares for His
disciples, if some of them cannot profit by higher subjects, comes down
to their level, and teaches them at any rate by simpler courses; so also
did the Word of God. As Paul also says: “For seeing <span
id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239) that in the wisdom of God the world
through its wisdom knew not God, it was God’s good pleasure through the
foolishness of the word preached to save them that believe.” 2. For
seeing that men, having rejected the contemplation of God, and with
their eyes downward, as though sunk in the deep, were seeking about for
God in nature and in the world of sense, feigning gods for themselves of
mortal men and demons; to this end the loving and general Saviour of
all, the Word of God, takes to Himself a body, and as Man walks among
men and meets the senses of all men half-way <span
id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240) , to the end, I say, that they who
think that God is corporeal may from what the Lord effects by His body
perceive the truth, and through Him recognize <span
id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241) the Father. 3. So, men as they were,
and human in all their thoughts, on whatever objects they fixed their
senses, there they saw themselves met half-way <span
id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242) , and taught the truth from every
side. 4. For if they looked with awe upon the Creation, yet they saw how
she confessed Christ as Lord; or if their mind was swayed toward men, so
as to think them gods, yet from the Saviour’s works, supposing they
compared them, the Saviour alone among men appeared Son of God; for
there were no such works done among the rest as have been done by the
Word of God. 5. Or if they were biassed toward evil spirits, even, yet
seeing them cast out by the Word, they were to know that He alone, the
Word of God, was God, and that the spirits were none. 6. Or if their
mind had already sunk even to the dead, so as to worship heroes, and the
gods spoken of in the poets, yet, seeing the Saviour’s resurrection,
they were to confess them to be false gods, and that the Lord alone is
true, the Word of the Father, that was Lord even of death. 7. For this
cause He was both born and appeared as Man, and died, and rose again,
dulling and casting into the shade the works of all former men by His
own, that in whatever direction the bias of men might be, from thence He
might recall them, and teach them of His own true Father, as He Himself
says: “I came to save and to find that which was lost <span
id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243) .”
