<span id="xviii.ii.xiii-Page_243"></span>13. *This charge rests on
forgery.*

<span id="xviii.ii.xiii-p2"></span>It is this that has thrown the
Churches everywhere into such confusion; for pretences have been
devised, and Bishops of great authority, and of advanced age <span
id="fr_1327"></span>[1328](#fn_1327) , have been banished for holding
communion with me. And if matters had stopped here, our prospect would
be favourable through your gracious interposition. But that the evil may
not extend itself, let Truth prevail before you; and leave not every
Church under suspicion, as though Christian men, nay even Bishops, could
be guilty of plotting and writing in this manner. Or if you are
unwilling to investigate the matter, it is but right that we who offer
our defence, should be believed, rather than our calumniators. They,
like enemies, are occupied in wickedness; we, as earnestly contending
for our cause, present to you our proofs. And truly I wonder how it
comes to pass, that while we address you with fear and reverence, they
are possessed of such an impudent spirit, that they dare even to lie
before the Emperor. But I pray you, for the Truth’s sake, and as it is
written <span id="fr_1328"></span>[1329](#fn_1328) , ‘search diligently’
in my presence, on what grounds they affirm these things, and whence
these letters were obtained. But neither will any of my servants be
proved guilty, nor will any of his people be able to tell whence they
came; for they are forgeries. And perhaps one had better not enquire
further. They do not wish it, lest the writer of the letters should be
certain of detection. For the calumniators alone, and none besides, know
who he is.
