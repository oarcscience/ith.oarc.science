And he embraced him, and sent him away, having written a letter by him to the Abbat Orsisius and the brethren, to the following effect:&#146;&#8212;</p>  
<p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.iv.xii-p4"></A>I have seen your fellow-worker and father of the brethren, Theodorus, and in him the master of our father Pachomius. And I rejoiced to see the sons of the Church, and they made me glad by their presence. But the Lord is their recompenser. And as Theodorus was about to leave me for you, he said to me: Remember me.

Presently, however, he resigned in favour of Theodorus, the favourite disciple of Pachomius. The two letters which follow are from the life of Pachomius, &sect;&sect;92, 96, <i>Acta SS.</i> for May, vol. iii. (Also in Migne xxvi. 977.) They belong, the first to the year 363 <span class="c10"><a name="xxv.iii.iv.xii-p2.3"></A>a.d.</span>, not long before the death of Julian (D.C.B. i. 199a), the second to the summer of the following year, 364 (<i>infr.</i> note 3). Both letters are characteristic; the second a moving and simple consolation to mourners.</p>
