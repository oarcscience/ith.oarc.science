<span id="xxi.ii.i.x-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—<span class="c10"><span
id="xxi.ii.i.x-p1.2"></span>Objections Continued</span>. *How the Word
has free will, yet without being alterable. He is unalterable because
the Image of the Father, proved from texts.*

<span id="xxi.ii.i.x-p2"></span>35. As to their question whether the
Word is alterable <span id="fr_2012"></span>[2013](#fn_2012) , it is
superfluous to examine it; it is enough simply to write down what they
say, and so to shew its daring irreligion. How they trifle, appears from
the following questions:—‘Has He free will, or has He not? is He good
from choice according to free will, and can He, if He will, alter, being
of an alterable nature? or, as wood or stone, has He not His choice free
to be moved and incline hither and thither?’ It is but agreeable to
their heresy thus to speak and think; for, when once they have framed to
themselves a God out of nothing and a created Son, of course they also
adopt such terms, as being suitable to a creature. However, when in
their controversies with Churchmen they hear from them of the real and
only Word of the Father, and yet venture thus to speak of Him, does not
their doctrine then become the most loathsome that can be found? is it
not enough to distract a man on mere hearing, though unable to reply,
and to make him stop his ears, from astonishment at the novelty of what
he hears them say, which even to mention is to blaspheme? For if the
Word be alterable and changing, where will He stay, and what will be the
end of His development? how shall the alterable possibly be like the
Unalterable? How should he who has seen the alterable, be considered to
have seen the Unalterable? At what state must He arrive, for us to be
able to behold in Him the Father? for it is plain <span id="page_327">p.
327</span> <span id="xxi.ii.i.x-Page_327"></span>that not at all times
shall we see the Father in the Son, because the Son is ever altering,
and is of changing nature. For the Father is unalterable and
unchangeable, and is always in the same state and the same; but if, as
they hold, the Son is alterable, and not always the same, but of an
ever-changing nature, how can such a one be the Father’s Image, not
having the likeness of His unalterableness <span
id="fr_2013"></span>[2014](#fn_2013) ? how can He be really in the
Father, if His purpose is indeterminate? Nay, perhaps, as being
alterable, and advancing daily, He is not perfect yet. But away with
such madness of the Arians, and let the truth shine out, and shew that
they are foolish. For must not He be perfect who is equal to God? and
must not He be unalterable, who is one with the Father, and His Son
proper to His essence? and the Father’s essence being unalterable,
unalterable must be also the proper Offspring from it. And if they
slanderously impute alteration to the Word, let them learn how much
their own reason is in peril; for from the fruit is the tree known. For
this is why he who hath seen the Son hath seen the Father; and why the
knowledge of the Son is knowledge of the Father.

<span id="xxi.ii.i.x-p5"></span>36. Therefore the Image of the
unalterable God must be unchangeable; for ‘Jesus Christ is the same
yesterday, to-day, and for ever <span
id="fr_2014"></span>[2015](#fn_2014) .’ And David in the Psalm says of
Him, ‘Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the
earth, and the heavens are the work of Thine hands. They shall perish,
but Thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment. And as
a vesture shalt Thou fold them up, and they shall be changed, but Thou
art the same, and Thy years shall not fail <span
id="fr_2015"></span>[2016](#fn_2015) .’ And the Lord Himself says of
Himself through the Prophet, ‘See now that I, even I am He,’ and ‘I
change not <span id="fr_2016"></span>[2017](#fn_2016) .’ It may be said
indeed that what is here signified relates to the Father; yet it suits
the Son also to say this, specially because, when made man, He manifests
His own identity and unalterableness to such as suppose that by reason
of the flesh He is changed and become other than He was. More
trustworthy are the saints, or rather the Lord, than the perversity of
the irreligious. For Scripture, as in the above-cited passage of the
Psalter, signifying under the name of heaven and earth, that the nature
of all things originate and created is alterable and changeable, yet
excepting the Son from these, shews us thereby that He is no wise a
thing originate; nay teaches that He changes everything else, and is
Himself not changed, in saying, ‘Thou art the same, and Thy years shall
not fail <span id="fr_2017"></span>[2018](#fn_2017) .’ And with reason;
for things originate, being from nothing <span
id="fr_2018"></span>[2019](#fn_2018) , and not being before their
origination, because, in truth, they come to be after not being, have a
nature which is changeable; but the Son, being from the Father, and
proper to His essence, is unchangeable and unalterable as the Father
Himself. For it were sin to say that from that essence which is
unalterable was begotten an alterable word and a changeable wisdom. For
how is He longer the Word, if He be alterable? or can that be Wisdom
which is changeable? unless perhaps, as accident in essence <span
id="fr_2019"></span>[2020](#fn_2019) , so they would have it, viz. as in
any particular essence, a certain grace and habit of virtue exists
accidentally, which is called Word and Son and Wisdom, and admits of
being taken from it and added to it. For they have often expressed this
sentiment, but it is not the faith of Christians; as not declaring that
He is truly Word and Son of God, or that the wisdom intended is true
Wisdom. For what alters and changes, and has no stay in one and the same
condition, how can that be true? whereas the Lord says, ‘I am the
Truth <span id="fr_2020"></span>[2021](#fn_2020) .’ If then the Lord
Himself speaks thus concerning Himself, and declares His
unalterableness, and the Saints have learned and testify this, nay and
our notions of God acknowledge it as religious, whence did these men of
irreligion draw this novelty? From their heart as from a seat of
corruption did they vomit it forth <span
id="fr_2021"></span>[2022](#fn_2021) .

[Next: Texts Explained; And First, Phil. II. 9, 10. Various texts which
are alleged against the Catholic doctrine: e.g. Phil. ii. 9, 10. Whether
the words 'Wherefore God hath highly exalted' prove moral probation and
advancement. Argued against, first, from the force of the word 'Son;'
which is inconsistent with such an interpretation. Next, the passage
examined. Ecclesiastical sense of 'highly exalted,' and 'gave,' and
'wherefore;' viz. as being spoken with reference to our Lord's manhood.
Secondary sense; viz. as implying the Word's 'exaltation' through the
resurrection in the same sense in which Scripture speaks of His descent
in the Incarnation; how the phrase does not derogate from the nature of
the Word.](2040356)
