But when two brethren were coming to him, the water failed on the way, and one died and the other was at the point of death, for he had no strength to go on, but lay upon the ground expecting to die. But Antony sitting in the mountain called two monks, who chanced to be there, and urged them saying, &#145;Take a pitcher of water and run on the road towards Egypt. For of two men who were coming, one is already dead and the other will die unless you hasten. For this has been revealed to me as I was praying.&#146; The monks therefore went, and found one lying dead, whom they buried, and the other they restored with water and led him to the old man.

. But if any one asks, why he did not speak before the other died, the question ought not to be asked. For the punishment of death was not Antony&#146;s but God&#146;s, who also judged the one and revealed the condition of the other. But the marvel here was only in the case of Antony: that he sitting in the mountain had his heart watchful, and had the Lord to show him things afar off.</p>
