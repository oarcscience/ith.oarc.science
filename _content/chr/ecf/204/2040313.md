<span id="xix.ii.x-p1"></span> 10. *Their real grievance is not that
Athanasius is a coward, but that he is free.*

<span id="xix.ii.x-p2"></span>Who then does not perceive their
craftiness? Is it not very evident to every one that they do not
reproach me with cowardice from regard to virtue, but that being athirst
for blood, they employ these their base devices as nets, thinking
thereby to catch those whom they seek to destroy? That such is their
character is shewn by their actions, which have convicted them of
possessing dispositions more savage than wild beasts, and more cruel
than Babylonians. But although the proof against them is sufficiently
clear from all this, yet since they still dissemble with soft words
after the manner of their ‘father the devil <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430) ,’ and pretend to charge me with
cowardice, while they are themselves more cowardly than hares; let us
consider what is written in the Sacred Scriptures respecting such cases
as this. For thus they will be shewn to fight against the Scriptures no
less than against me, while they detract from the virtues of the Saints.

<span id="xix.ii.x-p4"></span>For if they reproach men for hiding
themselves from those who seek to destroy them, and accuse those who
flee from their persecutors, what will they do when they see Jacob
fleeing from his brother Esau, and Moses withdrawing into Midian for
fear of Pharaoh? What excuse will they make for David, after all this
idle talk, for fleeing from his house on account of Saul, when he sent
to kill him, and for hiding himself in the cave, and for changing his
appearance, until he withdrew from Abimelech <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431) , and escaped his designs against
him? What will they say, they who are ready to say anything, when they
see the great Elijah, after calling upon God and raising the dead,
hiding himself for fear of Ahab, and fleeing from the threats of
Jezebel? At which time also the sons of the prophets, when they were
sought after, hid themselves with the assistance of Obadiah, and lay
concealed in caves <span id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432) .
