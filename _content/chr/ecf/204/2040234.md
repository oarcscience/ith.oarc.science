to him, the water failed on the way, and one died and the other was at
the point of death, for he had no strength to go on, but lay upon the
ground expecting to die. But Antony sitting in the mountain called two
monks, who chanced to be there, and urged them saying, ‘Take a pitcher
of water and run on the road towards Egypt. For of two men who were
coming, one is already dead and the other will die unless you hasten.
For this has been revealed to me as I was praying.’ The monks therefore
went, and found one lying dead, whom they buried, and the other they
restored with water and led him to the old man. For it was a day’s

asks, why he did not speak before the other died, the question ought not
to be asked. For the punishment of death was not Antony’s but God’s, who
also judged the one and revealed the condition of the other. But the
marvel here was only in the case of Antony: that he sitting in the
mountain had his heart watchful, and had the Lord to show him things
afar off.
