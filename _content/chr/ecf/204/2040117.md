<span id="vii.ii.xx"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.xx-p1"></span> §20. *None, then, could bestow
incorruption, but He Who had made, none restore the likeness of God,
save His Own Image, none quicken, but the Life, none teach, but the
Word. And He, to pay our debt of death, must also die for us, and rise
again as our first-fruits from the grave. Mortal therefore His Body must
be; corruptible, His Body could not be.*

<span id="vii.ii.xx-p2"></span>We have, then, now stated in part, as far
as it was possible, and as ourselves had been able to understand, the
reason of His bodily ap<span id="page_47">p. 47</span> <span
id="vii.ii.xx-Page_47"></span>pearing; that it was in the power of none
other to turn the corruptible to incorruption, except the Saviour
Himself, that had at the beginning also made all things out of nought
and that none other could create anew the likeness of God’s image for
men, save the Image of the Father; and that none other could render the
mortal immortal, save our Lord Jesus Christ, Who is the Very Life <span
id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252) ; and that none other could teach men
of the Father, and destroy the worship of idols, save the Word, that
orders all things and is alone the true Only-begotten Son of the Father.
2. But since it was necessary also that the debt owing from all should
be paid again: for, as I have already said <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253) , it was owing that all should die,
for which especial cause, indeed, He came among us: to this intent,
after the proofs of His Godhead from His works, He next offered up His
sacrifice also on behalf of all, yielding His Temple to death in the
stead of all, in order firstly to make men quit and free of their old
trespass, and further to shew Himself more powerful even than death,
displaying His own body incorruptible, as first-fruits of the
resurrection of all. 3. And do not be surprised if we frequently <span
id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254) repeat the same words on the same
subject. For since we are speaking of the counsel of God, therefore we
expound the same sense in more than one form, lest we should seem to be
leaving anything out, and incur the charge of inadequate treatment: for
it is better to submit to the blame of repetition than to leave out
anything that ought to be set down. 4. The body, then, as sharing the
same nature with all, for it was a human body, though by an unparalleled
miracle it was formed of a virgin only, yet being mortal, was to die
also, conformably to its peers. But by virtue of the union of the Word
with it, it was no longer subject to corruption according to its own
nature, but by reason of the Word that was come to dwell <span
id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255) in it it was placed out of the reach
of corruption. 5. And so it was that two marvels came to pass at once,
that the death of all was accomplished in the Lord’s body, and that
death and corruption were wholly done away by reason of the Word that
was united with it. For there was need of death, and death must needs be
suffered on behalf of all, that the debt owing from all might be paid.
6. Whence, as I said before, the Word, since it was not possible for Him
to die, as He was immortal, took to Himself a body such as could die,
that He might offer it as His own in the stead of all, and as suffering,
through His union <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256) with it, on
behalf of all, “Bring <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257) to nought
Him that had the power of death, that is the devil; and might deliver
them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to
bondage.”

[Next: Death brought to nought by the death of Christ. Why then did not
Christ die privately, or in a more honourable way? He was not subject to
natural death, but had to die at the hands of others. Why then did He
die? Nay but for that purpose He came, and but for that, He could not
have risen.](2040118)
