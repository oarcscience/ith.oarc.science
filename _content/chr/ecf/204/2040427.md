<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Letter XX</span>.—*(For 348.) Coss.
Philippus, Salia; Præfect the same Nestorius; Indict. vi; Easter-day iii
Non. Apr., viii Pharmuthi; Æra Dioclet. 64; Moon 18.*

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xxv.iii.iii.xvi-p2.1"></span>Let</span> us now keep the feast, my
brethren, for as our Lord then gave notice to His disciples, so He now
tells us beforehand, that ‘after some days is the Passover <span
id="fr_4503"></span>[4504](#fn_4503) ,’ in which the Jews indeed
betrayed the Lord, but we celebrate His death as a feast, rejoicing
because we then obtained rest from our afflictions. We are diligent in
assembling ourselves together, for we were scattered in time past and
were lost, and are found. We were far off, and are brought nigh, we were
strangers, and have become His, Who suffered for us, and was nailed on
the cross, Who bore our sins, as the prophet <span
id="fr_4504"></span>[4505](#fn_4504) saith, and was afflicted for us,
that He might put away from all of us grief, and sorrow, and sighing.
When we thirst, He satisfies us on the feast-day itself; standing and
crying, ‘If any man thirst, let him come to Me, and drink <span
id="fr_4505"></span>[4506](#fn_4505) .’ For such is the love of the
saints at all times, that they never once leave off, but offer the
uninterrupted, constant sacrifice to the Lord, and continually thirst,
and ask of Him to drink <span id="fr_4506"></span>[4507](#fn_4506) ; as
David sang, ‘My God, my God, early will I seek <span id="page_549">p.
549</span> <span id="xxv.iii.iii.xvi-Page_549"></span>Thee, my soul
thirsteth for Thee; many times my heart and flesh longeth for Thee in a
barren land, without a path, and without water. Thus was I seen by Thee
in the sanctuary <span id="fr_4507"></span>[4508](#fn_4507) .’ And
Isaiah the prophet says, ‘From the night my spirit seeketh Thee early, O
God, because Thy commandments are light <span
id="fr_4508"></span>[4509](#fn_4508) .’ And another says, ‘My soul
fainteth for the longing it hath for Thy judgments at all times.’ And
again he says, ‘For Thy judgments I have hoped, and Thy law will I keep
at all times <span id="fr_4509"></span>[4510](#fn_4509) .’ Another
boldly cries out, saying, ‘Mine eye is ever towards the Lord.’ And with
him one says, ‘The meditation of my heart is before Thee at all times.’
And Paul further advises, ‘At all times give thanks; pray without
ceasing <span id="fr_4510"></span>[4511](#fn_4510) .’ Those who are thus
continually engaged, are waiting entirely on the Lord, and say, ‘Let us
follow on to know the Lord: we shall find Him ready as the morning, and
He will come to us as the early and the latter rain for the earth <span
id="fr_4511"></span>[4512](#fn_4511) .’ For not only does He satisfy
them in the morning; neither does He give them only as much to drink as
they ask; but He gives them abundantly according to the multitude of His
lovingkindness, vouchsafing to them at all times the grace of the
Spirit. And what it is they thirst for He immediately adds, saying, ‘He
that believeth on Me.’ For, ‘as cold waters are pleasant to those who
are thirsty <span id="fr_4512"></span>[4513](#fn_4512) ,’ according to
the proverb, so to those who believe in the Lord, the coming of the
Spirit is better than all refreshment and delight.

<span id="xxv.iii.iii.xvi-p13"></span>2. It becomes us then in these
days of the Passover, to rise early with the saints, and approach the
Lord with all our soul, with purity of body, with confession and godly
faith in Him; so that when we have here first drunk, and are filled with
these divine waters which \[flow\] from Him, we may be able to sit at
table with the saints in heaven, and may share in the one voice of
gladness which is there. From this sinners, because it wearied them, are
rightly cast out, and hear the words, ‘Friend, how camest thou in
hither, not having a wedding garment <span
id="fr_4513"></span>[4514](#fn_4513) ?’ Sinners indeed thirst, but not
for the grace of the Spirit; but being inflamed with wickedness, they
are wholly set on fire by pleasures, as saith the Proverb, ‘All day long
he desires evil desires.’ But the Prophet cries against them, saying,
‘Wo unto those who rise up early, and follow strong drink; who continue
until the evening, for wine inflameth them <span
id="fr_4514"></span>[4515](#fn_4514) .’ And since they run wild in
wantonness, they dare to thirst for the destruction of others. Having
first drunk of lying and unfaithful waters, those things have come upon
them, which are stated by the Prophet; ‘My wound,’ saith he, ‘is
grievous, whence shall I be healed; it hath surely been to me like
deceitful waters, in which there is no trust <span
id="fr_4515"></span>[4516](#fn_4515) .’ Secondly, while they drink with
their companions, they lead astray and disturb the right mind, and turn
away the simple from it. And what does he cry? ‘Wo unto him who causeth
his neighbour to drink turbid destruction, and maketh him drunk, that he
may look upon his caverns <span id="fr_4516"></span>[4517](#fn_4516) .’
But those who dissemble, and steal away the truth, quench their hearts.
Having first drunk of these things, they go on to say those things which
the whore saith in the Proverbs, ‘Lay hold with delight on hidden bread,
and sweet stolen waters <span id="fr_4517"></span>[4518](#fn_4517) .’
They lay snares secretly, because they have not the freedom of virtue,
nor the boldness of Wisdom <span id="fr_4518"></span>[4519](#fn_4518) ,
who praises herself in the gates, and employs freedom of speech in the
broad ways, preaching on high walls. For this reason, they are bidden to
‘lay hold with delight <span id="fr_4519"></span>[4520](#fn_4519) ,’
because, having the choice between faith and pleasures, they steal the
sweetness of truth, and disguise their own bitter waters \[to escape\]
from the blame of their wickedness, which would have been speedy and
public. On this account, the wolf puts on the skin of the sheep,
sepulchres deceive by their whitened exteriors <span
id="fr_4520"></span>[4521](#fn_4520) . Satan, that is <span
id="fr_4521"></span>[4522](#fn_4521) …
