<span id="xviii.ii.xxxv-p1"></span> 35. It was therefore better for me
to hide myself, and to wait for this opportunity. Yes, I am sure that
from your knowledge of the sacred Scriptures you will assent and approve
of my conduct in this respect. For you will perceive that, now those who
exasperated you against us have been silenced, your righteous clemency
is apparent, and it is proved to all <span id="page_253">p. 253</span>
<span id="xviii.ii.xxxv-Page_253"></span>men that you never persecuted
the Christians at all, but that it was they who made the Churches
desolate, that they might sow the seeds of their own impiety everywhere;
on account of which I also, had I not fled, should long ago have
suffered from their treachery. For it is very evident that they who
scrupled not to utter such calumnies against me, before the great
Augustus, and who so violently assailed Bishops and Virgins, sought also
to compass my death. But thanks be to the Lord who has given you the
kingdom. All men are confirmed in their opinion of your goodness, and of
their wickedness, from which I fled at the first, that I might now make
this appeal unto you, and that you might find some one towards whom you
may shew kindness. I beseech you, therefore, forasmuch as it written, ‘A
soft answer turneth away wrath,’ and ‘righteous thoughts are acceptable
unto the King <span id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386) ;’ receive this
my defence, and restore all the Bishops and the rest of the Clergy to
their countries and their Churches; so that the wickedness of my
accusers may be made manifest, and that you, both now and in the day of
judgment, may have boldness to say to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
the King of all, ‘“None of Thine have I lost <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387) ,” but these are they who designed
the ruin of all, while I was grieved for those who perished, and for the
Virgins who were scourged, and for all other things that were committed
against the Christians; and I brought back them that were banished, and
restored them to their own Churches.’
