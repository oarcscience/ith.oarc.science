id="xiv.ii.i-p1.1"></span>De Decretis or Defence of the Nicene
Definition</span>

<span id="xiv.ii.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="xiv.ii.i-p3"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="xiv.ii.i-p3.1"></span>Chapter I</span>.—<span class="c10"><span
id="xiv.ii.i-p3.2"></span>Introduction</span>. *The complaint of the
Arians against the Nicene Council; their fickleness; they are like Jews;
their employment of force instead of reason.*

<span id="xiv.ii.i-p4"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="xiv.ii.i-p4.1"></span>Thou</span> hast done well, in signifying to
me the discussion thou hast had with the advocates of Arianism, among
whom were certain of the friends of Eusebius, as well as very many of
the brethren who hold the doctrine of the Church. I hailed thy vigilance
for the love of Christ, which excellently exposed the irreligion <span
id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745) of their heresy; while I marvelled at
the effrontery which led the Arians, after all the past detection of
unsoundness and futility in their arguments, nay, after the general
conviction of their extreme perverseness, still to complain like the
Jews, “Why did the Fathers at Nicæa use terms not in Scripture <span
id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746) , ‘Of the essence’ and ‘One in
essence?’” Thou then, as a man of learning, in spite of their
subterfuges, didst convict them of talking to no purpose; and they in
devising them were but acting suitably to their own evil disposition.
For they are as variable and fickle in their sentiments, as chameleons
in their colours <span id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747) ; and when
exposed they look confused, and when questioned they hesitate, and then
they lose shame, and betake themselves to evasions. And then, when
detected in these, they do not rest till they invent fresh matters which
are not, and, according to the Scripture, ‘imagine a vain thing <span
id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748) ’; and all that they may be constant
to their irreligion.

<span id="xiv.ii.i-p9"></span>Now such endeavours <span
id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749) are nothing else than an obvious token
of their defect of reason <span id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750) , and
a copying, as I have said, of Jewish malignity. For the Jews too, when
convicted by the Truth, and unable to confront it, used evasions, such
as, ‘What sign doest Thou, that we may see and believe Thee? What dost
Thou work <span id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751) ? though so many signs
were given, that they said themselves, ‘What do we? for this man doeth
many miracles <span id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752) .’ In truth, dead
men were raised, lame walked, blind saw afresh, lepers were cleansed,
and the water became wine, and five loaves satisfied five thousand, and
all wondered and worshipped the Lord, confessing that in Him were
fulfilled the prophecies, and that He was God the Son of God; all but
the Pharisees, who, though the signs shone brighter than the sun, yet
complained still, as ignorant men, ‘Why dost Thou, being a man, make
<span id="page_151">p. 151</span> <span
id="xiv.ii.i-Page_151"></span>Thyself God <span
id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753) ?’ Insensate, and verily blind in
understanding! they ought contrariwise to have said, “Why hast Thou,
being God, become man?” for His works proved Him God, that they might
both worship the goodness of the Father, and admire the Son’s Economy
for our sakes. However, this they did not say; no, nor liked to witness
what He was doing; or they witnessed indeed, for this they could not
help, but they changed their ground of complaint again, “Why healest
Thou the paralytic, why makest Thou the born-blind to see, on the
sabbath day?” But this too was an excuse, and mere murmuring; for on
other days as well did the Lord heal ‘all manner of sickness, and all
manner of disease <span id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754) ,’ but they
complained still according to their wont, and by calling Him Beelzebub,
preferred the suspicion of Atheism <span
id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755) , to a recantation of their own
wickedness. And though in such sundry times and divers manners the
Saviour shewed His Godhead and preached the Father to all men,
nevertheless, as kicking against the pricks, they contradicted in the
language of folly, and this they did, according to the divine proverb,
that by finding occasions, they might separate themselves from the
truth <span id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756) .

<span id="xiv.ii.i-p18"></span>2. As then the Jews of that day, for
acting thus wickedly and denying the Lord, were with justice deprived of
their laws and of the promise made to their fathers, so the Arians,
Judaizing now, are, in my judgment, in circumstances like those of
Caiaphas and the contemporary Pharisees. For, perceiving that their
heresy is utterly unreasonable, they invent excuses, “Why was this
defined, and not that?” Yet wonder not if now they practise thus; for in
no long time they will turn to outrage, and next will threaten ‘the band
and the captain <span id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757) .’ Forsooth in
these their heterodoxy has its support, as we see; for denying the Word
of God, reason have they none at all, as is equitable. Aware then of
this, I would have made no reply to their interrogations: but, since thy
friendliness <span id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758) has asked to know
the transactions of the Council, I have without any delay related at
once what then took place, shewing in few words, how destitute Arianism
is of a religious spirit, and how their one business is to frame
evasions.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[150:746](2040199.htm#fr_745) <span
id="xiv.ii.i-p4.2"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii.i-p5"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.i-p5.1"></span>εὐσέβεια, ἀσέβεια</span>, &c., here translated
“religion, irreligion, religious, &c. &c.” are technical words
throughout, being taken from S. Paul’s text, “Great is the mystery of
*godliness,*” <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.i-p5.3"></span>εὐσεβείας</span>, i.e. orthodoxy. Such too
seems to be the meaning of “godly admonitions,” and “godly judgments,”
and “this godly and well-learned man,” in our Ordination Services. The
Latin translation is “pius,” “pietas.” It might be in some respects
suitably rendered by “devout” and its derivatives. On its familiar use
in the controversy depends the blasphemous jest of Eudoxius, Arian
Bishop of Constantinople, which was received with loud laughter in the
Cathedral, and remained in esteem down to Socrates’ day, “The Father is
<span class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.i-p5.5"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.i-p5.6"></span>σεβὴς</span>, as being
without devotion, the Son εὐσεβὴς, devout, as paying devotion to the
Father.” Socr. *Hist.* ii. 43. Hence Arius ends his Letter to Eusebius
with <span class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.i-p5.9"></span>ἀ</span><span

<span id="xiv.ii.i-p6"></span> It appears that the Arians did not
venture to speak disrespectfully of the definition of the Council till
the date (<span class="c10"><span id="xiv.ii.i-p6.2"></span>a.d.</span>
352) of this work, when Acacius headed them. Yet the plea here used, the
unscriptural character of its symbol, had been suggested to Constantius
on his accession, <span class="c10"><span
id="xiv.ii.i-p6.3"></span>a.d.</span> 337, by the Arian priest, the
favourite of Constantia, to whom Constantine had entrusted his will,
Theod. *Hist.* ii. 3; and Eusebius of Cæsarea glances at it, at the time
of the Council, in the letter to his Church, which is subjoined to this
Treatise.

the Arians, vid. infra, §4. &c. *Orat.* ii. 40. He says, ad *Ep. Æg.* 6.
that they considered Creeds as yearly covenants; and *de Synod.* §3. 4.
as State Edicts. vid. also §14. and *passim.* “What wonder that they

Athanasius, to the judicial consequence of their denying the Word of
God. Thus, just below, n. 3. “Denying the Word” or Reason “of God,
reason have they none.” Also *Orat.* i. §35. fin. §40. init. §62.
*Orat.* ii. §7. init. Hence he so often calls the Arians “mad” and
“deranged;” e.g. “not aware how ‘mad’ their ‘reason’ is.” *Orat.* i.

Aetius was called <span class="Greek"><span

id="xiv.ii.i-p16.6"></span>ἄθεος</span>, the ungodly. *de Synod.* §6;
and Arius complains that Alexander had expelled him and his from
Alexandria, <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.i-p16.8"></span>ὡ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.i-p16.9"></span>ς</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.i-p16.10"></span>ἀνθρώπους ἀθέους</span>. Theodor. *Hist*. i.
4. “Atheism” and “Atheist” imply intention, system, and profession, and
are so far too strong a rendering of the Greek. Since Christ was God, to
deny Him was to deny God. The force of the term, however, seems to be,
that, whereas the Son had revealed the “unknown God,” and destroyed the
reign of idols, the denial of the Son was bringing back idolatry and its
attendant spiritual ignorance. Thus *contr. Gent.* §29. fin. he speaks
of “the Greek idolatry as full of all Atheism” or ungodliness, and
contrasts with it the knowledge of “the Guide and Framer of the
Universe, the Father’s Word,” “that through Him ‘we may discern His
Father,’ and the Greeks may know ‘how far they have separated themselves
from the truth.’” And *Orat.* ii. 43. he classes Arians with the Greeks,
who “though they have the name of God in their mouths, incur the charge
of ‘Atheism,’ because they know not the real and true God, ‘the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ.’” (vid. also Basil in *Eunom.* ii. 22.)
Shortly afterwards he gives a further reason for the title, observing
that Arianism was worse than previous heresies, such as Manicheism,
inasmuch as the latter denied the Incarnation, but Arianism tore from
God’s substance His connatural Word, and, as far as its words went,
infringed upon the perfections and being of the first Cause. And so ad
*Ep. Æg.* §17. fin. he says, that it alone, beyond other heresies, “has
been bold against the Godhead Itself in a mad way (<span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.i-p16.12"></span>μανικώτερον</span>, vid.
foregoing note), denying that there is a Word, and that the Father was
always Father.” Elsewhere he speaks more generally, as if Arianism
introduced “an Atheism or rather Judaism ‘against the Scriptures,’ being
next door to Heathenism, so that its disciple cannot be even named
Christian; for all such tenets are ‘contrary to the Scriptures;’” and he
makes this the reason why the Nicene Fathers stopped their ears and
condemned it. ad *Ep. Æg.* §13. For the same reason he calls the heathen
<span class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.i-p16.14"></span>ἄ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.i-p16.15"></span>θεοι</span>, atheistical
or ungodly, “who are arraigned of irreligion by Divine Scripture.”
*contr. Gent.* §14. vid. <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.ii.i-p16.17"></span>εἰδώλων ἀθεότητα</span>. §46. init.
Moreover, he calls the Arian persecution worse than the pagan
‘cruelties,’ and therefore “a Babylonian Atheism,” *Ep. Encycl.* §5. as
not allowing the Catholics the use of prayer and baptism, with a
reference to <span id="xiv.ii.i-p16.19"></span>[Dan. vi.
11](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#011)<span id="xiv.ii.i-p16.21"></span>,
&c. Thus too he calls Constantius atheist, for his treatment of Hosius;
<span class="Greek"><span id="xiv.ii.i-p16.23"></span>οὔτε τὸν θεὸν
φοβηθεὶς ὁ ἄθεος</span>. *Hist. Arian.* 45. Another reason for the title
seems to have lain in the idolatrous character of Arian worship ‘on its
own shewing,’ viz. as worshipping One whom they yet maintained to be a
creature. \[Prolegg. ch. ii. §3 (2)a, *sub. fin.*\]

purpose.” ad *Ep. Æg.* 13.
