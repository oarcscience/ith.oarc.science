<p class="c11"><a name="vii.ii.xxxiii-p2"></A>These things being so, and the Resurrection of His body and the victory gained over death by the Saviour being clearly proved, come now let us put to rebuke both the disbelief of the Jews and the scoffing of the Gentiles. 2. For these, perhaps, are the points where Jews express incredulity, while Gentiles laugh, finding fault with the unseemliness of the Cross, and of the Word of God becoming man. But our argument shall not delay to grapple with both especially as the proofs at our command against them are clear as day. 3. For Jews in their incredulity may be refuted from the Scriptures, which even themselves read; for this text and that, and, in a word, the whole inspired Scripture, cries aloud concerning these things, as even its express words abundantly shew. For prophets proclaimed beforehand concerning the wonder of the Virgin and the birth from her, saying: &#8220;Lo, the&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_281"></A><A HREF="#fn_281"><FONT SIZE="1">282</FONT></A>
 Virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us.&#8221; 4. But Moses, the truly great, and whom they believe to speak truth, with reference to the Saviour&#146;s becoming man, having estimated what was said as important, and assured of its truth, set it down in these words: &#8220;There&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_282"></A><A HREF="#fn_282"><FONT SIZE="1">283</FONT></A>
 shall rise a star out of Jacob, and a man out of Israel, and he shall break in pieces the captains of Moab.&#8221; And again: &#8220;How lovely are thy habitations O Jacob, thy tabernacles O Israel, as shadowing gardens, and as parks by the rivers, and as tabernacles which the Lord hath fixed, as cedars by the waters. A man shall come forth out of his seed, and shall be Lord over many peoples.&#8221; And again, Esaias: &#8220;Before&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_283"></A><A HREF="#fn_283"><FONT SIZE="1">284</FONT></A>
 the Child know how to call father or mother, he shall take the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria before the king of Assyria.&#8221; 5. That a man, then, shall appear is foretold in those words. But that He that is to come is Lord of all, they predict once more as follows: &#8220;Behold&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_284"></A><A HREF="#fn_284"><FONT SIZE="1">285</FONT></A>
 the Lord sitteth upon a light cloud, and shall come into Egypt, and the graven images of Egypt shall be shaken.&#8221; For from thence also it is that the Father calls Him back, saying: &#8220;I called&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_285"></A><A HREF="#fn_285"><FONT SIZE="1">286</FONT></A>
 My Son out of Egypt.&#8221;</p>
