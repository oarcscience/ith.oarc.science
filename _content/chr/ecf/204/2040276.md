<span id="xviii.ii.xi-p1"></span> 11. *Challenge to the accusers as to
the alleged letter.*

<span id="xviii.ii.xi-p2"></span>Now I have already called upon God, and
His Word, the Only-begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ, to witness for
me, that I have never written to that man, nor received letters from
him. And as to my accuser, give me leave to ask him a few short
questions concerning this charge also. How did he come to the knowledge
of this matter? Will he say that he has got copies of the letter? for
this is what the Arians laboured to prove. Now in the first place, even
if he can shew writing resembling mine, the thing is not yet certain;
for there are forgers, who have often imitated the hand <span
id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317) even of you who are Emperors. And
the resemblance will not prove the genuineness of the letter, unless my
customary amanuensis shall testify in its favour. I would then again ask
my accusers, Who provided you with these copies? and whence were they
obtained? I had my writers <span id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318) ,
and he his servants, who received his letters from the bearers, and gave
them into his hand. My assistants are forthcoming; vouchsafe to summon
the others (for they are most probably still living), and enquire
concerning these letters. Search into the matter, as though Truth were
the partner of your throne. She is the defence of Kings, and especially
of Christian Kings; with her you will reign most securely, for holy
Scripture says, ‘Mercy and truth preserve the king, and they will
encircle his throne in righteousness <span
id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319) .’ And the wise Zorobabel gained a
victory over the others by setting forth the power of Truth, and all the
people cried out, ‘Great is the truth, and mighty above all things <span
id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320) .’
