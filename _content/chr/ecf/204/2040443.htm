 to the Mareotis from Sardica,</i> <span class="c10"><a name="xxv.iii.iv.i-p3.3"></A>a.d</span>. 343&#8211;4.</p>  
<p class="c11"><a name="xxv.iii.iv.i-p4"></A><span class="c10"><a name="xxv.iii.iv.i-p4.1"></A>Athanasius</span> to the presbyters and deacons and the people of the Catholic Church in the Mareotis, brethren beloved and longed for, greeting in the Lord.</p>  
<p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.iv.i-p5"></A>The holy council has praised your piety in Christ. They have all acknowledged your spirit and fortitude in all things, in that ye did not fear threats, and though you had to bear insults and persecutions against your piety you held out. Your letters when read out to all produced tears and enlisted universal sympathy. They loved you though absent, and reckoned your persecutions as their own. Their letter to you is a proof of their affection: and although it would suffice to include you along with the holy Church of Alexandria&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4563"></A><A HREF="#fn_4563"><FONT SIZE="1">4564</FONT></A>
, yet the holy synod has written separately to you in order that ye may be encouraged not to give way on account of your sufferings, but to give thanks to God; because your patience shall have good fruit.</p>  
<p class="c12"><a name="xxv.iii.iv.i-p7"></A>Formerly the character of the heretics was not evident. But now it is revealed and laid open to all. For the holy synod has taken cognisance of the calumnies these men have concocted against you, and has had them in abhorrence, and has deposed Theodore, Valens, Ursacius, in Alexandria&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4564"></A><A HREF="#fn_4564"><FONT SIZE="1">4565</FONT></A>
 and the Mareotis by consent of all. The same notice has been given to other Churches also. And since the cruelty and tyranny practised by them against the Churches can no longer be borne, they have been cast out from the episcopate and expelled from the communion of all. Moreover of Gregory they were unwilling even to make mention, for since the man has lacked the very name of bishop, they thought it superfluous to name him. But on account of those who are deceived by him they have mentioned his name; not because he seemed worthy of mention, but that those deceived by him might thereby recognise his infamy and blush at the kind of man with whom they have communicated. You will learn what has been written about them from the previous document&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4565"></A><A HREF="#fn_4565"><FONT SIZE="1">4566</FONT></A>
: and though not all of the bishops came together to sign, yet it was drawn up by all, and they signed for all. Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the brethren salute you.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="xxv.iii.iv.i-p3"></A> This and the following letters were first printed by Scipio Maffei from a Latin <span class="c10"><a name="xxv.iii.iv.i-p3.2"></A>ms.</span> in the Chapter Library of Verona, along with the <i>Historia Acephala.</i> They were included in Galland, <i>Bibl. Patr.</i> vol. 5, and in Justiniani&#146;s Ed. of Athanasius (Padua, 1777). The letters are printed in Migne, xxvi. 1333, <i>sqq.,</i> along with one (from the same source) addressed by the Council to the Mareotic Churches. Hefele doubts their genuineness, but without reason (ii. 166, <i>E. Tra.</i>) The list of signatures (an independent source of information, <i>supr.</i> p. 147) alone proves the contrary. The two letters may be taken as a supplement to the documents given, <i>Apol. c. Ar.</i> 37&#8211;50 (see also p. 147), with which they have many points of resemblance. The Latin is very bad and occasionally without sense; it bears clear traces of being a rendering by an unskilful hand from Greek.</p>
