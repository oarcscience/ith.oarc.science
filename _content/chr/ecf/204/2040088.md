<span id="vi.ii.iii.vii-p1"></span> §41. *The Presence of the Word in
nature necessary, not only for its original Creation, but also for its
permanence*.

<span id="vi.ii.iii.vii-p2"></span>But though He is Word, He is not, as
we said, after the likeness of human words, composed of syllables; but
He is the unchanging Image of His own Father. For men, composed of parts
and made out of nothing, have their discourse composite and divisible.
But God possesses true existence and is not composite, wherefore His
Word also has true Existence and is not composite, but is the one and
only-begotten God <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165) , Who proceeds
in His goodness from the Father as from a good Fountain, and orders all
things and holds them together. 2. But the reason why the Word, the Word
of God, has united Himself <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166) with
created things is truly wonderful, and teaches us that the present order
of things is none otherwise than is fitting. For the nature of created
things, inasmuch as it is brought into being out of nothing, is of a
fleeting sort, and weak and mortal, if composed of itself only. But the
God of all is good and exceeding noble by nature,—and therefore is kind.
For one that is good can grudge nothing <span
id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167) : for which reason he does not grudge
even existence, but desires all to exist, as objects for His
loving-kindness. 3. Seeing then all created nature, as far as its own
laws were concerned, to be fleeting and subject to dissolution, lest it
should come to this and lest the Universe should be broken up again into
nothingness, for this cause He made all things by His own eternal Word,
and gave substantive existence to Creation, and moreover did not leave
it to be tossed in a tempest in the course of its own nature, lest it
should run the risk of once more dropping out of existence <span
id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168) ; but, because He is good He guides
and settles the whole Creation by His own Word, Who is Himself also God,
that by the governance and providence and ordering action of the Word,
Creation may have light, and be enabled to abide alway securely. For it
partakes of the Word Who derives true existence from the Father, and is
helped by Him so as to exist, lest that should come to it which would
have come but for the maintenance of it by the Word,—namely,
dissolution,—“for He is the Image of the invisible God, the first-born
of all Creation, for through Him and in Him all things consist, things
visible and things invisible, and He is the Head of the Church,” as the
ministers of truth teach in their holy writings <span
id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169) .
