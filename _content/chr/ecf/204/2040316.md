<span id="xix.ii.xiii-p1"></span> 13. *Example of Our Lord.*

<span id="xix.ii.xiii-p2"></span>When they see these things, or rather
even hear of them, for see they do not, will they not desire, as it is
written, to become ‘fuel of fire <span
id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440) ,’ because their counsels and their
words are contrary to what the Lord both did and taught? Also when John
was martyred, and his disciples buried his body, ‘when Jesus heard of
it, He departed thence by ship into a desert place apart <span
id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441) .’ Thus the Lord acted, and thus He
taught. Would that these men were even now ashamed of their conduct, and
confined their rashness to man, nor proceeded to such extreme madness as
even to charge our Saviour with cowardice! for it is against Him that
they now utter their blasphemies. But no one will endure such madness;
nay it will be seen that they do not understand the Gospels. The cause
must be a reasonable and just one, which the Evangelists represent as
weighing with our Saviour to withdraw and to flee; and we ought
therefore to assign the same for the conduct of all the Saints. (For
whatever is written concerning our Saviour in His human nature, ought to
be considered as applying to the whole race of mankind <span
id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442) ; because He took our body, and
exhibited in Himself human infirmity.) Now of this cause John has
written thus, ‘They sought to take Him: but no man laid hands on Him,
because His hour was not yet come <span
id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443) .’ And before it came, He Himself
said to His Mother, ‘Mine hour is not yet come <span
id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444) :’ and to them who were called His
brethren, ‘My time is not yet come <span
id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445) .’ And again, when His time was
come, He said to the disciples, ‘Sleep on now, and take your rest: for
behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the
hands of sinners <span id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446) .’
