<span id="xix.ii.ix-p1"></span> 9. *The accusation shews the mind of the
accusers.*

<span id="xix.ii.ix-p2"></span>Now if they had been of sound mind, they
would have seen that they were in this strait, and that they were
falling foul of their own arguments. But since they have lost all
judgment, they are still led on to persecute, and seek to destroy, and
yet perceive not their own impiety. It may be they even venture to
accuse Providence itself (for nothing is beyond the reach of their
presumption), that it does not deliver up to them those whom they
desire; certain as it is, according to the saying of our Saviour, that
not even a sparrow can fall into the snare without our Father which is
in heaven <span id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427) . But when these
accursed ones obtain possession of any one, they immediately forget not
only all other, but even themselves; and raising their brow in very
haughtiness, they neither acknowledge times and seasons, nor respect
human nature in those whom they injure. Like the tyrant of Babylon <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428) , they attack more furiously; they
shew pity to none, but mercilessly ‘upon the ancient,’ as it is written,
‘they very heavily lay the yoke,’ and ‘they add to the grief of them
that are wounded <span id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429) .’ Had they
not acted in this manner; had they not driven into banishment those who
spoke in my defence against their calumnies, their representations might
have appeared to some persons sufficiently plausible. But since they
have conspired against so many other Bishops of high character, and have
spared neither the great confessor Hosius, nor the Bishop of Rome, nor
so many others from the Spains and the Gauls, and Egypt, and Libya, and
the other countries, but have committed such cruel outrages against all
who have in any way opposed them in my behalf; is it not plain that
their designs have been directed rather against me than against any
other, and that their desire is miserably to destroy me as they have
done others? To accomplish this they vigilantly watch for an
opportunity, and think themselves injured, when they see those safe,
whom they wished not to live.
