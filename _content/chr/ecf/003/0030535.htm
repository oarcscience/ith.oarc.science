<p class="c19"><a name="v.vi.xx-p2"></A>The Demiurge therefore, placed as he was without the limits of the Pleroma in the ignominious solitude of his eternal exile, founded a new empire&#8212;this world (of ours)&#8212;by clear<A NAME="page_514"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 514</FONT></A> <a name="v.vi.xx-Page_514"></A>ing away the confusion and distinguishing the difference between the two substances which severally constituted it,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6815"></A><A HREF="#fn_6815"><FONT SIZE="1">6816</FONT></A>
 the animal and the material. Out of incorporeal (elements) he constructs bodies, heavy, light, erect&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6816"></A><A HREF="#fn_6816"><FONT SIZE="1">6817</FONT></A>
 and stooping, celestial and terrene. He then completes the sevenfold stages of heaven itself, with his own throne above all. Whence he had the additional name of Sabbatum from the hebdomadal nature of his abode; his mother Achamoth, too, had the title Ogdoada, after the precedent of the primeval Ogdoad.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6817"></A><A HREF="#fn_6817"><FONT SIZE="1">6818</FONT></A>
 These heavens, however, they consider to be intelligent,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6818"></A><A HREF="#fn_6818"><FONT SIZE="1">6819</FONT></A>
 and sometimes they make angels of them, as indeed they do of the Demiurge himself; as also (they call) Paradise the fourth archangel, because they fix it above the third heaven, of the power of which Adam partook, when he sojourned there amidst its fleecy clouds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6819"></A><A HREF="#fn_6819"><FONT SIZE="1">6820</FONT></A>
 and shrubs.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6820"></A><A HREF="#fn_6820"><FONT SIZE="1">6821</FONT></A>
 Ptolemy remembered perfectly well the prattle of his boyhood,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6821"></A><A HREF="#fn_6821"><FONT SIZE="1">6822</FONT></A>
 that apples grew in the sea, and fishes on the tree; after the same fashion, he assumed that nut-trees flourished in the skies.&#160; The Demiurge does his work in ignorance, and therefore perhaps he is unaware that trees ought to be planted only on the ground. His mother, of course, knew all about it: how is it, then, that she did not suggest the fact, since she was actually executing her own operation? But whilst building up so vast an edifice for her son by means of those works, which proclaim him at once to be father, god and, king before the conceits of the Valentinians, why she refused to let them be known to even him,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6822"></A><A HREF="#fn_6822"><FONT SIZE="1">6823</FONT></A>
 is a question which I shall ask afterwards.</p>
