<span id="v.vi.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The Profane Account Given of the
Origin of Christ and the Holy Ghost Sternly Rebuked. An Absurdity
Respecting the Attainment of the Knowledge of God Ably Exposed.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xi-p2"></span>Accordingly, after the banishment of the
Enthymesis, and the return of her mother Sophia to her husband, the
(illustrious) Monogenes, the Nus, <span
id="fr_6732"></span>[6733](#fn_6732) released indeed from all care and
concern of the Father, in order that he might consolidate all things,
and defend and at last fix the Pleroma, and so prevent any concussion of
the kind again, once more <span id="fr_6733"></span>[6734](#fn_6733)
emits a new couple <span id="fr_6734"></span>[6735](#fn_6734)
(blasphemously named). I should suppose the coupling of two males to be
a very shameful thing, or else the one <span
id="fr_6735"></span>[6736](#fn_6735) must be a female, and so the male
is discredited <span id="fr_6736"></span>[6737](#fn_6736) by the female.
One divinity is assigned in the case of all these, to procure a complete
adjustment among the Æons. Even from this fellowship in a common duty
two schools actually arise, two chairs, <span
id="fr_6737"></span>[6738](#fn_6737) and, to some extent, <span
id="fr_6738"></span>[6739](#fn_6738) the inauguration of a division in
the doctrine of Valentinus. It was the function of Christ to instruct
the Æons in the nature of their conjugal relations <span
id="fr_6739"></span>[6740](#fn_6739) (you see what the whole thing was,
of course!), and how to form some guess about the unbegotten, <span
id="fr_6740"></span>[6741](#fn_6740) and to give them the capacity of
generating within themselves the knowledge of the Father; it being
impossible to catch the idea of him, or comprehend him, or, in short,
even to enjoy any perception of him, either by the eye or the ear,
except through Monogenes (the Only-begotten). Well, I will even grant
them what they allege about knowing the Father, so that they do not
refuse us (the attainment of) the same. I would rather point out what is
perverse in their doctrine, how they were taught that the
incomprehensible part of the Father was the cause of their own
perpetuity, <span id="fr_6741"></span>[6742](#fn_6741) whilst that which
might be com<span id="page_510">p. 510</span> <span
id="v.vi.xi-Page_510"></span>prehended of him was the reason <span
id="fr_6742"></span>[6743](#fn_6742) of their generation and formation.
Now by these several positions <span
id="fr_6743"></span>[6744](#fn_6743) the tenet, I suppose, is
insinuated, that it is expedient for God not to be apprehended, on the
very ground that the incomprehensibility of His character is the cause
of perpetuity; whereas what in Him is comprehensible is productive, not
of perpetuity, but rather of conditions which lack perpetuity—namely,
nativity and formation.  The Son, indeed, they made capable of
comprehending the Father. The manner in which He is comprehended, the
recently produced Christ fully taught them.  To the Holy Spirit,
however, belonged the special gifts, whereby they, having been all set
on a complete par in respect of their earnestness to learn, should be
enabled to offer up their thanksgiving, and be introduced to a true
tranquillity.
