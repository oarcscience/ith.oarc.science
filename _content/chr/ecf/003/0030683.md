<span id="v.x.ii"></span>

<span id="v.x.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.x.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.</span>

<span id="v.x.ii-p2"></span>But not yet about the good to be got from
martyrdom must we learn, without our having first *heard* about the duty
of suffering it; nor must we *learn* the usefulness of it, before we
have *heard* about the necessity for it. The (question of the) divine
warrant goes first—whether God has willed and also commanded ought of
the kind, so that they who assert that it is not good are not plied with
arguments for thinking it profitable save when they have been
subdued. <span id="fr_8227"></span>[8228](#fn_8227) It is proper that
heretics be driven <span id="fr_8228"></span>[8229](#fn_8228) to duty,
not enticed. Obstinacy must be conquered, not coaxed. And, certainly,
that will be pronounced beforehand quite good enough, which will be
shown to have been instituted and also enjoined by God.  Let the Gospels
wait a little, while I set forth their root the Law, while I ascertain
the will of God from those writings from which I recall to mind Himself
also: “*I* am,” says He, “God, thy God, who have brought thee out of the
land of Egypt. Thou shalt have no other gods besides me. Thou shalt not
make unto thee a likeness of those things which are in heaven, and which
are in the earth beneath, and which are in the sea under the earth. Thou
shalt not worship them, nor serve them. For I am the Lord thy
God.” <span id="fr_8229"></span>[8230](#fn_8229) Likewise in the same
*book of* Exodus: “Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you
from heaven. Ye shall not make unto you gods of silver, neither shall ye
make unto you gods of gold.” <span id="fr_8230"></span>[8231](#fn_8230)
To the following effect also, in Deuteronomy: “Hear, O Israel; The Lord
thy God is one: and thou shalt love the <span id="page_635">p.
635</span> <span id="v.x.ii-Page_635"></span>Lord thy God with all thy
heart and all thy might, and with all thy soul.” <span
id="fr_8231"></span>[8232](#fn_8231) And again:  “Neither do thou forget
the Lord thy God, who brought thee forth from the land of Egypt, out of
the house of bondage.  Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve Him
only, and cleave to Him, and swear by His name. Ye shall not go after
strange gods, and the gods of the nations which are round about you,
because the Lord thy God is also a jealous God among you, and lest His
anger should be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face
of the earth.” <span id="fr_8232"></span>[8233](#fn_8232) But setting
before them blessings and curses, He also says: “Blessings shall be
yours, if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God, whatsoever I
command you this day, and do not wander from the way which I have
commanded you, to go and serve other gods whom ye know not.” <span
id="fr_8233"></span>[8234](#fn_8233) And as to rooting them out in every
way: “Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations, which
ye shall possess by inheritance, served their gods, upon mountains and
hills, and under shady trees. Ye shall overthrow all their altars, ye
shall overturn and break in pieces their pillars, and cut down their
groves, and burn with fire the graven images of the gods themselves, and
destroy the names of them out of that place.” <span
id="fr_8234"></span>[8235](#fn_8234) He further urges, when they (the
Israelites) had entered the land of promise, and driven out its nations:
“Take heed to thy self, that thou do not follow them after they be
driven out from before thee, that thou do not inquire after their gods,
saying, As the nations serve their gods, so let me do likewise.” <span
id="fr_8235"></span>[8236](#fn_8235) But also says He: “If there arise
among you a prophet himself, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a
sign or a wonder, and it come to pass, and he say, Let us go and serve
other gods, whom ye know not, do not hearken to the words of that
prophet or dreamer, for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether
ye fear God with all your heart and with all your soul. After the Lord
your God ye shall go, and fear Him, and keep His commandments, and obey
His voice, and serve Him, and cleave unto Him. But that prophet or
dreamer shall die; for he has spoken to turn thee away from the Lord thy
God.” <span id="fr_8236"></span>[8237](#fn_8236) But also in another
section, <span id="fr_8237"></span>[8238](#fn_8237) “If, however, thy
brother, the son of thy father or of thy mother, or thy son, or thy
daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend who is as thine own
soul, solicit thee, saying secretly, Let us go and serve other gods,
which thou knowest not, nor did thy fathers, of the gods of the nations
which are round about thee, very nigh unto thee or far off from thee, do
not consent to go with him, and do not hearken to him. Thine eye shall
not spare him, neither shalt thou pity, neither shalt thou preserve him;
thou shalt certainly inform upon him.  Thine hand shall be first upon
him to kill him, and afterwards the hand of thy people; and ye shall
stone him, and he shall die, seeing he has sought to turn thee away from
the Lord thy God.” <span id="fr_8238"></span>[8239](#fn_8238) He adds
likewise concerning cities, that if it appeared that one of these had,
through the advice of unrighteous men, passed over to other gods, all
its inhabitants should be slain, and everything belonging to it become
accursed, and all the spoil of it be gathered together into all its
places of egress, and be, even with all the people, burned with fire in
all its streets in the sight of the Lord God; and, says He, “it shall
not be for dwelling in for ever: it shall not be built again any more,
and there shall cleave to thy hands nought of its accursed plunder, that
the Lord may turn from the fierceness of His anger.” <span
id="fr_8239"></span>[8240](#fn_8239) He has, from His abhorrence of
idols, framed a series of curses too: “Cursed be the man who maketh a
graven or a molten image, an abomination, the work of the hands of the
craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place.” <span
id="fr_8240"></span>[8241](#fn_8240) But in Leviticus He says: “Go not
ye after idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the Lord your
God.” <span id="fr_8241"></span>[8242](#fn_8241) And in other passages:
“The children of Israel are my household servants; these are they whom I
led forth from the land of Egypt: <span
id="fr_8242"></span>[8243](#fn_8242) I am the Lord your God. Ye shall
not make you idols fashioned by the hand, neither rear you up a graven
image.  Nor shall ye set up a remarkable stone in your land (to worship
it): I am the Lord your God.” <span id="fr_8243"></span>[8244](#fn_8243)
These words indeed were first spoken by the Lord by the lips of Moses,
being applicable certainly to whomsoever the Lord God of Israel may lead
forth in like manner from the Egypt of a most superstitious world, and
from the abode of human slavery. But from the mouth of every prophet in
succession, sound forth also utterances of the same God, augmenting the
same law of His by a renewal of the same commands, and in the first
place announcing no other duty in so special a manner as the being on
guard against all making and worshipping of idols; as when <span
id="page_636">p. 636</span> <span id="v.x.ii-Page_636"></span>by the
mouth of David He says: “The gods of the nations are silver and gold:
they have eyes, and see not; they have ears, and hear not; they have a
nose, and smell not; a mouth, and they speak not; hands, and they handle
not; feet and they walk not. Like to them shall be they who make them,
and trust in them.” <span id="fr_8244"></span>[8245](#fn_8244)
