id="iv.viii.ii.i-p3.1"></span>Chapter I.—The Heathen Gods from Heathen
Authorities. Varro Has Written a Work on the Subject. His Threefold
Classification. The Changeable Character of that Which Ought to Be Fixed
and Certain.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.i-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.i-p4.1"></span>Our</span> defence requires that we should
at this point discuss with you the character of your gods, O ye heathen,
fit objects of our pity, <span id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773)
appealing even to your own conscience to determine whether they be truly
gods, as you would have it supposed, or falsely, as you are unwilling to
have proved. <span id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774) Now this is the
material part of human error, owing to the wiles of its author, that it
is never free from the ignorance of error, <span
id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775) whence your guilt is all the greater. 
Your eyes are open, yet they see not; your ears are unstopped, yet they
hear not; though your heart beats, it is yet dull, nor does your mind
understand <span id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776) that of which it is
cognizant. <span id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777) If indeed the
enormous perverseness (of your worship) could <span
id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778) be broken up <span
id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779) by a single demurrer, we should have
our objection ready to hand in the declaration <span
id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780) that, as we know all those gods of
yours to have been instituted by men, all belief in the true Deity is by
this very circumstance brought to nought; <span
id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781) because, of course, nothing which some
time or other had a beginning can rightly seem to be divine. But the
fact is, <span id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782) there are many things
by which tenderness of conscience is hardened into the callousness of
wilful error. Truth is beleaguered with the vast force (of the enemy),
and yet how secure she is in her own inherent strength! And naturally
enough <span id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783) when from her very
adversaries she gains to her side whomsoever she will, as her friends
and protectors, and prostrates the entire host of her assailants. It is
therefore against these things that our contest lies—against the
institutions of our ancestors, against the authority of tradition, <span
id="fr_784"></span>[785](#fn_784) the laws of our governors, and the
reasonings of the wise; against antiquity, custom, submission; <span
id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785) against precedents, prodigies,
miracles,—all which things have had their part in consolidating that
spurious <span id="fr_786"></span>[787](#fn_786) system of your gods.
Wishing, then, to follow step by step your own commentaries which you
have drawn out of your theology of every sort (because the authority of
learned men goes further with you in matters of this kind than the
testimony of facts), I have taken and abridged the works of Varro; <span
id="fr_787"></span>[788](#fn_787) for he in his treatise *Concerning
Divine Things*, collected out of ancient digests, has shown himself a
serviceable guide <span id="fr_788"></span>[789](#fn_788) for us. Now,
if I inquire of him who were the subtle inventors <span
id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789) of the gods, he points to either the
philosophers, the peoples, or the poets. For he has made a threefold
distinction in classifying the gods: one being the *physical* class, of
which the philosophers treat; another the *mythic* class, which is the
constant burden of <span id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790) the poets;
the third, the *gentile* class, which the nations have adopted each one
for itself. When, therefore, the philosophers have ingeniously composed
their physical (theology) out of their <span id="page_130">p. 130</span>
<span id="iv.viii.ii.i-Page_130"></span>own conjectures, when the poets
have drawn their mythical from fables, and the (several) nations have
forged their gentile (polytheism) according to their own will, where in
the world must truth be placed? In the conjectures? Well, but these are
only a doubtful conception. In the fables? But they are at best an
absurd story. In the popular accounts? <span
id="fr_791"></span>[792](#fn_791) This sort of opinion, <span
id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792) however, is only promiscuous <span
id="fr_793"></span>[794](#fn_793) and municipal. Now all things with the
philosophers are uncertain, because of their variation with the poets
all is worthless, because immoral; with the nations all is irregular and
confused, because dependent on their mere choice.  The nature of God,
however, if it be the true one with which you are concerned, is of so
definite a character as not to be derived from uncertain
speculations, <span id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794) nor contaminated
with worthless fables, nor determined by promiscuous conceits. It ought
indeed to be regarded, as it really is, as certain, entire, universal,
because it is in truth the property of all. Now, what god shall I
believe? One that has been gauged by vague suspicion? One that
history <span id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795) has divulged? One that a
community has invented? It would be a far worthier thing if I believed
no god, than one which is open to doubt, or full of shame, or the object
of arbitrary selection. <span id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796)

<span id="iv.viii.ii.i-p2"></span> In this part of his work the author
reviews the heathen mythology, and exposes the absurdity of the
polytheistic worship in the various classes of the gods, according to
the distribution of Varro.
