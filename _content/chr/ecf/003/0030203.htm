<p class="c19"><a name="iv.x.vii-p8"></A>Those who would pursue the subject of Demonology, which Tertullian opens in this admirable treatise, should follow it up in a writer whom Tertullian greatly influenced, in many particulars, even when he presents a remarkable contrast. The Ninth Book of the <i>City of God</i> is devoted to inquiries which throw considerable light on some of the startling sayings of our author as to the heathen systems, and their testimony to the Soul&#146;s Consciousness of God and of the great enemy of God and the inferior spirit of Evil.</p>
