<span id="v.viii.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LII.—From St. Paul’s Analogy of the
Seed We Learn that the Body Which Died Will Rise Again, Garnished with
the Appliances of Eternal Life.</span>

<span id="v.viii.lii-p2"></span>Let us now see in what body he asserts
that the dead will come. And with a felicitous sally he proceeds at once
to illustrate the point, as if an objector had plied him with some such
question.  “Thou fool,” says he, “that which thou sowest is not
quickened, except it die.” <span id="fr_7673"></span>[7674](#fn_7673)
From this example of the *seed* it is then evident that no other flesh
is quickened than that which shall have undergone death, and therefore
all the rest of the question will become clear enough. For nothing which
is incompatible with the idea suggested by the example can possibly be
understood; nor from the clause which follows, “That which thou sowest,
thou sowest not the body which shall be,” <span
id="fr_7674"></span>[7675](#fn_7674) are you permitted to suppose that
in the resurrection a different body is to arise from that which is sown
in death.  Otherwise you have run away from the example. For if wheat be
sown and dissolved in the ground, barley does not spring up. Still it is
not <span id="fr_7675"></span>[7676](#fn_7675) the very same grain in
kind; nor is its nature the same, or its quality and form. Then whence
*comes it*, if it is not the very same? For even the decay is *a proof
of* the thing itself, since it is *the decay* of the actual *grain*.
Well, but does not the apostle himself suggest in what sense it is that
“the body which shall be” is not the body which is sown, even when he
says, “But bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain;
but God giveth it a body as it pleaseth Him?” <span
id="fr_7676"></span>[7677](#fn_7676) *Gives it* of course to the grain
which he says is sown bare. No doubt, you say. Then the grain is safe
enough, to which God has to assign a body. But how safe, if it is
nowhere in existence, if it does not rise again if it rises not again
its actual self? If it rises not again, it is not safe; *and* if it is
not even safe, it cannot receive a body from God.  But there is every
possible proof that it is safe. For what purpose, therefore, will God
give it “a body, as it pleases Him,” even when it already has its own
“bare” body, unless it be that in its resurrection it may be no longer
bare? That therefore will be additional matter which is placed over the
*bare* body; nor is that at all destroyed on which the superimposed
matter is put,—nay, it is increased. That, however, is safe which
receives augmentation. The truth is, it is sown the barest grain,
without a husk to cover it, without a spike even in germ, without the
protection of a bearded top, without the glory of a stalk. It rises,
however, out of the furrow enriched with a copious crop, built up in a
compact fabric, constructed in a *beautiful* order, fortified by
cultivation, and clothed around on every side.  These are the
circumstances which make it another body from God, to which it is
changed not by abolition, but by amplification. And to every seed *God*
has assigned its own body <span id="fr_7677"></span>[7678](#fn_7677)
—not, indeed, its own in the sense of its primitive body—in order that
what it acquires from God extrinsically may also at last be accounted
its own. Cleave firmly then to the example, and keep it well in view, as
a mirror of what happens to the flesh: believe that the very same
*flesh* which was once sown *in death* will bear fruit *in
resurrection-life*—the same in essence, only more full and perfect; not
another, although reappearing in another form. For it shall receive in
itself the grace and ornament which God shall please to spread over it,
according to its merits. Unquestionably it is in this sense that he
says, “All flesh is not the same flesh;” <span
id="fr_7678"></span>[7679](#fn_7678) meaning not to deny a community of
substance, but a parity of prerogative,—reducing the body to a
difference of honour, not of nature. With this view he adds, in a
figurative sense, certain examples of animals and heavenly bodies:
“There is one flesh of man” (that is, servants of God, but really
human), “another flesh of beasts” (that is, the heathen, of whom the
prophet actually says, “Man is like the senseless cattle” <span
id="fr_7679"></span>[7680](#fn_7679) ), “another flesh of birds” (that
is, the martyrs which essay to mount up to heaven), “another of fishes”
(that is, those whom the water of baptism has submerged). <span
id="fr_7680"></span>[7681](#fn_7680) In like manner does he take
examples from the heavenly <span id="page_586">p. 586</span> <span
id="v.viii.lii-Page_586"></span>bodies: “There is one glory of the sun”
(that is, of Christ), “and another glory of the moon” (that is, of the
Church), “and another glory of the stars” (in other words, of the seed
of Abraham). “For one star differeth from another star in glory: so
there are bodies terrestrial as well as celestial” (Jews, that is, as
well as Christians). <span id="fr_7681"></span>[7682](#fn_7681) Now, if
this language is not to be construed figuratively, it was absurd enough
for him to make a contrast between the flesh of mules and kites, as well
as the heavenly bodies and human bodies; for they admit of no comparison
as to their condition, nor in respect of their attainment of a
resurrection. Then at last, having conclusively shown by his examples
that the difference was one of glory, not of substance, he adds: “So
also is the resurrection of the dead.” <span
id="fr_7682"></span>[7683](#fn_7682) How so?  In no other way than as
differing in glory only. For again, predicating the resurrection of the
same substance and returning once more to (his comparison of) the grain,
he says: “It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is
sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is
raised in power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual
body.” <span id="fr_7683"></span>[7684](#fn_7683) Now, certainly nothing
else is raised than that which is sown; and nothing else is sown than
that which decays in the ground; and it is nothing else than the flesh
which is decayed in the ground. For this was the substance which God’s
decree demolished, “Earth thou art, and to earth shalt thou
return;” <span id="fr_7684"></span>[7685](#fn_7684) because it was taken
out of the earth.  And it was from this circumstance that the apostle
borrowed his phrase of the flesh being “sown,” since it returns to the
ground, and the ground is the grand depository for seeds which are meant
to be deposited in it, and again sought out of it. And therefore he
confirms the passage afresh, by putting on it the impress (of his own
inspired authority), saying, “For so it is written;” <span
id="fr_7685"></span>[7686](#fn_7685) that you may not suppose that the
“being sown” means anything else than “thou shalt return to the ground,
out of which thou wast taken;” nor that the phrase “for so it is
written” refers to any other thing that the flesh.
