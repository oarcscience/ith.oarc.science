<span id="iv.viii.i.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Truth and Reality Pertain to
Christians Alone. The Heathen Counselled to Examine and Embrace
It.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xx-p2"></span>How long therefore, O most unjust
heathen, will you refuse to acknowledge us, and (what is more) to
execrate your own (worthies), since between us no distinction has place,
because we are one and the same? Since you do not (of course) hate what
you yourselves are, give us rather your right hands in fellowship, unite
your salutations, <span id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758) mingle your
embraces, sanguinary with the sanguinary, incestuous with the
incestuous, conspirators with conspirators, obstinate and vain with
those of the selfsame qualities. In company with each other, we have
been traitors to the majesty of the gods; and together do we provoke
their indignation. You too have your “third race;” <span
id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759) not indeed third in the way of
religious rite, <span id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760) but a third race
in sex, and, made up as it is of male and female in one, it is more
fitted to men and women (for offices of lust). <span
id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761) Well, then, do we offend you by the
very fact of our approximation and agreement?  Being on a par is apt to
furnish unconsciously the materials for rivalry. Thus “a potter envies a
potter, and a smith a smith.” <span id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762)
But we must now discontinue this imaginary confession. <span
id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763) Our conscience has returned to the
truth, and to the consistency of truth. For all those points which you
allege <span id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764) (against us) will be
really found in ourselves alone; and we alone can rebut them, against
whom they are adduced, by getting you to listen <span
id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765) to the other side of the question,
whence that full knowledge is learnt which both inspires counsel and
directs the judgment.  Now it is in fact your own maxim, that no one
should determine a cause without hearing both sides of it; and it is
only in our own case that you neglect (the equitable principle). You
indulge to the full <span id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766) that fault
of human nature, that those things which you do not disallow in
yourselves you condemn in others, or you boldly charge <span
id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767) against others those things the guilt
of which <span id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768) you retain a lasting
consciousness of <span id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769) in yourselves.
The course of life in which you will choose to occupy yourselves is
different from ours: whilst chaste in the eyes of others, you are <span
id="page_128">p. 128</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.xx-Page_128"></span>unchaste towards your own selves;
whilst vigorous against vice out of doors, you succumb to it at home.
This is the injustice (which we have to suffer), that, knowing truth, we
are condemned by those who know it not; free from guilt, we are judged
by those who are implicated in it. Remove the mote, or rather the beam,
out of your own eye, that you may be able to extract the mote from the
eyes of others. Amend your own lives first, that you may be able to
punish the Christians. Only so far as you shall have effected your own
reformation, will you refuse to inflict punishment on them—nay, so far
will you have become Christians yourselves; and as you shall have become
Christians, so far will you have compassed your own amendment of life.
Learn what that is which you accuse in us, and you will accuse no
longer; search out what that is which you do not accuse in yourselves,
and you will become self-accusers. From these very few and humble
remarks, so far as we have been able to open out the subject to you, you
will plainly get some insight into (your own) error, and some discovery
of *our* truth. Condemn that truth if you have the heart, <span
id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770) but only after you have examined it;
and approve the error still, if you are so minded, <span
id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771) only first explore it. But if your
prescribed rule is to love error and hate truth, why, (let me ask,) do
you not probe to a full discovery the objects both of your love and your
hatred?
