<span id="iv.xi.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVIII.—Causes and Circumstances
of Dreams. What Best Contributes to Efficient Dreaming.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xlviii-p2"></span>They say that dreams are more sure and
clear when they happen towards the end of the night, because then the
vigour of the soul emerges, and heavy sleep departs. As to the seasons
of the year, dreams are calmer in spring, since summer relaxes, and
winter somehow hardens, the soul; while autumn, which in other respects
is trying to health, is apt to enervate the soul by the lusciousness of
its fruits.  Then, again, as regards the position of one’s body during
sleep, one ought not to lie on his back, nor on his right side, nor so
as to wrench <span id="fr_1775"></span>[1776](#fn_1775) his intestines,
as if their cavity were reversely stretched: a palpitation of the heart
would ensue, or else a pressure on the liver would produce a painful
disturbance of the mind. But however this be, I take it that it all
amounts to ingenious conjecture rather than certain proof (although the
author of the conjecture be no less a man than Plato); <span
id="fr_1776"></span>[1777](#fn_1776) and possibly all may be no other
than the result of chance. But, generally speaking, dreams will be under
control of a man’s will, if they be capable of direction at all; for we
must not examine what *opinion* on the one hand, and *superstition* on
the other, have to prescribe for the treatment of dreams, in the matter
of distinguishing and modifying different sorts of food.  As for the
*superstition*, we have an instance when fasting is prescribed for such
persons as mean to submit to the sleep which is necessary for receiving
the oracle, in order that such abstinence may produce the required
purity; while we find an instance of the *opinion* when the disciples of
Pythagoras, in order to attain the same end, reject the bean as an
aliment which would load the stomach, and produce indigestion. But the
three brethren, who were the companions of Daniel, being content with
pulse alone, to escape the contamination of the royal dishes, <span
id="fr_1777"></span>[1778](#fn_1777) received from God, besides other
wisdom, the gift especially of penetrating and explaining the sense of
dreams. For my own part, I hardly know whether fasting would not simply
make me dream so profoundly, that I should not be aware whether I had in
fact dreamt at all. Well, then, you ask, has not sobriety something to
do in this matter?  Certainly it is as much concerned in this as it is
in the entire subject: if it contributes some good service to
superstition, much more does it to religion. For even demons require
such discipline from their dreamers as a gratification to their
divinity, because they know that it is acceptable to God, since Daniel
(to quote him again) “ate no pleasant bread” for the space of three
weeks. <span id="fr_1778"></span>[1779](#fn_1778) This abstinence,
however, he used in order to please God by humiliation, and not for the
purpose of producing a sensibility and wisdom for his soul previous to
receiving communication by dreams and visions, as if it were not rather
to effect such action in an ecstatic state. This *sobriety*, then, (in
which our question arises,) will have nothing to do with exciting
ecstasy, but will rather serve to recommend its being wrought by God.
