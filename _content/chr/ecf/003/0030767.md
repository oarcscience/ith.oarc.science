id="vi.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Of Kneeling.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii-p2"></span>In the matter of *kneeling* also prayer
is subject to diversity of observance, through the act of some few who
abstain from kneeling on the Sabbath; and since this dissension is
particularly on its trial before the churches, the Lord will give His
grace that the dissentients may either yield, or else indulge their
opinion without offence to others. We, however (just as we have
received), only on the day of the Lord’s Resurrection ought to guard not
only against kneeling, but every posture and office of solicitude;
deferring even our businesses lest we give any place to the devil. <span
id="fr_8914"></span>[8915](#fn_8914) Similarly, too, in the period of
Pentecost; which period we distinguish by the same solemnity of
exultation. <span id="fr_8915"></span>[8916](#fn_8915) But who would
hesitate *every* day to prostrate himself before God, at least in the
first prayer with which we enter on the daylight?  At fasts, moreover,
and Stations, no prayer should be made without kneeling, and the
remaining customary marks of humility; for (then) <span
id="fr_8916"></span>[8917](#fn_8916) we are not only *praying*, but
*deprecating*, and making satisfaction to God our Lord. <span
id="fr_8917"></span>[8918](#fn_8917) Touching *times* of prayer nothing
at all has been prescribed, except clearly “to pray at every time and
every place.” <span id="fr_8918"></span>[8919](#fn_8918)

*kneeling* being more “a posture of solicitude” and of humility;
*standing*, of “exultation.”
