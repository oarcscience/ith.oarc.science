<span id="v.vi.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The Heresy Traceable to Valentinus,
an Able But Restless Man. Many Schismatical Leaders of the School
Mentioned. Only One of Them Shows Respect to the Man Whose Name
Designates the Entire School.</span>

<span id="v.vi.iv-p2"></span>We know, I say, most fully their actual
origin, and we are quite aware why we call them Valentinians, although
they affect to disavow their name.  They have departed, it is
true, <span id="fr_6656"></span>[6657](#fn_6656) from their founder, yet
is their origin by no means destroyed; and even if it chance to be
changed, the very change bears testimony to the fact. Valentinus had
expected to become a bishop, because he was an able man both in genius
and eloquence. Being indignant, however, that another obtained the
dignity by reason of a claim which confessorship <span
id="fr_6657"></span>[6658](#fn_6657) had given him, he broke with the
church of the true faith. Just like those (restless) spirits which, when
roused by ambition, are usually inflamed with the desire of revenge, he
applied himself with all his might <span
id="fr_6658"></span>[6659](#fn_6658) to exterminate the truth; and
finding the clue <span id="fr_6659"></span>[6660](#fn_6659) of a certain
old opinion, he marked out a path for himself with the subtlety of a
serpent. Ptolemæus afterwards entered on the same path, by
distinguishing the names and the numbers of the Ænons into personal
substances, which, however, he kept apart from God. Valentinus had
included these in the very essence of the Deity, as senses and
affections of motion. Sundry bypaths were then struck off therefrom, by
Heraclean and Secundus and the magician Marcus. Theotimus worked hard
about “the images of the law.” Valentinus, however, was as yet nowhere,
and still the Valentinians derive their name from Valentinus. Axionicus
at Antioch is the only man who at the present time does honour <span
id="fr_6660"></span>[6661](#fn_6660) to the memory of Valentinus, by
keeping his rules <span id="fr_6661"></span>[6662](#fn_6661) to the
full. But this heresy is permitted to fashion itself into as many
various shapes as a courtezan, who usually changes and adjusts her dress
every day. And why not?  When they review that spiritual seed of theirs
in every man after this fashion, whenever they have hit upon any
novelty, they forthwith call their presumption a revelation, their own
perverse ingenuity a spiritual gift; but (they deny all) unity,
*admitting only* diversity. <span id="fr_6662"></span>[6663](#fn_6662)
And thus we clearly see that, setting aside their customary
dissimulation, most of them are in a divided state, being ready to say
(and that sincerely) of certain points of their belief, “This is not
so;” and, “I take this in a different sense;” and, “I do not admit
that.” By this variety, indeed, innovation is stamped on the very face
of their rules; besides which, it wears all the colourable features of
ignorant conceits. <span id="fr_6663"></span>[6664](#fn_6663)
