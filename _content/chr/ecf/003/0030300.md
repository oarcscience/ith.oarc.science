<span id="v.iii.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—No Early Controversy
Respecting the Divine Creator; No Second God Introduced at First.
Heresies Condemned Alike by the Sentence and the Silence of Holy
Scripture.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxxiv-p2"></span>These are, as I suppose, the different
kinds of spurious doctrines, which (as we are informed by the apostles
themselves) existed in their own day.  And yet we find amongst so many
various perversions of truth, not one school <span
id="fr_2212"></span>[2213](#fn_2212) which raised any controversy
concerning God as the Creator of all things. No man was bold enough to
surmise a second god. More readily was doubt felt about the Son than
about the Father, until Marcion introduced, in addition to the Creator,
another god of goodness only.  Apelles made the Creator of some
nondescript <span id="fr_2213"></span>[2214](#fn_2213) glorious angel,
who belonged to the superior God, the god (according to him,) of the law
and of Israel, affirming that he was fire. <span
id="fr_2214"></span>[2215](#fn_2214) Valentinus disseminated his Æons,
and traced the sin of one Æon <span id="fr_2215"></span>[2216](#fn_2215)
to the production of God the Creator. To none, forsooth, except these,
nor prior to these, was revealed the truth of the Divine Nature; and
they obtained this especial honour and fuller favour from the devil, we
cannot doubt, <span id="fr_2216"></span>[2217](#fn_2216) because he
wished even in this respect to rival God, that he might succeed, by the
poison of his doctrines, in doing himself what the Lord said could not
be done—making “the disciples above their Master.” <span
id="fr_2217"></span>[2218](#fn_2217) Let the entire mass <span
id="fr_2218"></span>[2219](#fn_2218) of heresies choose, therefore, for
themselves the times when they should appear, provided that the *when*
be an unimportant point; allowing, too, that they be not of the truth,
and (as a matter of course <span id="fr_2219"></span>[2220](#fn_2219) )
that such as had no exist<span id="page_260">p. 260</span> <span
id="v.iii.xxxiv-Page_260"></span>ence in the time of the apostles could
not possibly have had any connection with the apostles. If indeed they
had then existed, their names would be extant, <span
id="fr_2220"></span>[2221](#fn_2220) with a view to their own repression
likewise.  Those (heresies) indeed which did exist in the days of the
apostles, are condemned in their very mention. <span
id="fr_2221"></span>[2222](#fn_2221) If it be true, then, that those
heresies, which in the apostolic times were in a rude form, are now
found to be the same, only in a much more polished shape, they derive
their condemnation from this very circumstance. Or if they were not the
same, but arose afterwards in a different form, and merely assumed from
them certain tenets, then, by sharing with them an agreement in their
teaching, <span id="fr_2222"></span>[2223](#fn_2222) they must needs
partake in their condemnation, by reason of the above-mentioned
definition, <span id="fr_2223"></span>[2224](#fn_2223) of lateness of
date, which meets us on the very threshold. <span
id="fr_2224"></span>[2225](#fn_2224) Even if they were free from any
participation in condemned doctrine, they would stand already
judged <span id="fr_2225"></span>[2226](#fn_2225) on the mere ground of
time, being all the more spurious because they were not even named by
the apostles. Whence we have the firmer assurance, that these were (the
heresies) which even then, <span id="fr_2226"></span>[2227](#fn_2226)
were announced as about to arise.
