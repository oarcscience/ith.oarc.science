<span id="v.iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Curiosity Ought Not Range Beyond
the Rule of Faith. Restless Curiosity, the Feature of Heresy.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p2"></span>So long, however, as its form exists in
its proper order, you may seek and discuss as <span id="page_250">p.
250</span> <span id="v.iii.xiv-Page_250"></span>much as you please, and
give full rein to <span id="fr_1998"></span>[1999](#fn_1998) your
curiosity, in whatever seems to you to hang in doubt, or to be shrouded
in obscurity. You have at hand, no doubt, some learned <span
id="fr_1999"></span>[2000](#fn_1999) brother gifted with the grace of
knowledge, some one of the experienced class, some one of your close
acquaintance who is curious like yourself; although with yourself, a
seeker he will, after all, <span id="fr_2000"></span>[2001](#fn_2000) be
quite aware <span id="fr_2001"></span>[2002](#fn_2001) that it is better
for you to remain in ignorance, lest you should come to know what you
ought not, because you have acquired the knowledge of what you ought to
know. <span id="fr_2002"></span>[2003](#fn_2002) “Thy faith,” He says,
“hath saved thee” <span id="fr_2003"></span>[2004](#fn_2003) not
*observe* your skill <span id="fr_2004"></span>[2005](#fn_2004) in the
Scriptures. Now, faith has been deposited in the rule; it has a law, and
(in the observance thereof) salvation. Skill, <span
id="fr_2005"></span>[2006](#fn_2005) however, consists in curious art,
having for its glory simply the readiness that comes from knack. <span
id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006) Let such curious art give place to
faith; let such glory yield to salvation. At any rate, let them either
relinquish their noisiness, <span id="fr_2007"></span>[2008](#fn_2007)
or else be quiet. To know nothing in opposition to the rule (of faith),
is to know all things. (Suppose) that heretics were not enemies to the
truth, so that we were not forewarned to avoid them, what sort of
conduct would it be to agree with men who do themselves confess that
they are still seeking? For if they are still seeking, they have not as
yet found anything amounting to certainty; and therefore, whatever they
seem for a while <span id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008) to hold,
they betray their own scepticism, <span
id="fr_2009"></span>[2010](#fn_2009) whilst they continue seeking. You
therefore, who seek after their fashion, looking to those who are
themselves ever seeking, a doubter to doubters, a waverer to waverers,
must needs be “led, blindly by the blind, down into the ditch.” <span
id="fr_2010"></span>[2011](#fn_2010) But when, for the sake of deceiving
us, they pretend that they are still seeking, in order that they may
palm <span id="fr_2011"></span>[2012](#fn_2011) their essays <span
id="fr_2012"></span>[2013](#fn_2012) upon us by the suggestion of an
anxious sympathy, <span id="fr_2013"></span>[2014](#fn_2013) —when, in
short (after gaining an access to us), they proceed at once to insist on
the necessity of our inquiring into such points as they were in the
habit of advancing, then it is high time for us in moral
obligation <span id="fr_2014"></span>[2015](#fn_2014) to repel <span
id="fr_2015"></span>[2016](#fn_2015) them, so that they may know that it
is not Christ, but themselves, whom we disavow. For since they are still
seekers, they have no fixed tenets yet; <span
id="fr_2016"></span>[2017](#fn_2016) and being not fixed in tenet, they
have not yet believed; and being not yet believers, they are not
Christians. But even though they have their tenets and their belief,
they still say that inquiry is necessary in order to discussion. <span
id="fr_2017"></span>[2018](#fn_2017) Previous, however, to the
discussion, they deny what they confess not yet to have believed, so
long as they keep it an object of inquiry. When men, therefore, are not
Christians even on their own admission, <span
id="fr_2018"></span>[2019](#fn_2018) how much more (do they fail to
appear such) to us! What sort of truth is that which they
patronize, <span id="fr_2019"></span>[2020](#fn_2019) when they commend
it to us with a lie?  Well, but they actually <span
id="fr_2020"></span>[2021](#fn_2020) treat of the Scriptures and
recommend (their opinions) out of the Scriptures! To be sure they
do. <span id="fr_2021"></span>[2022](#fn_2021) From what other source
could they derive arguments concerning the things of the faith, except
from the records of the faith?

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p4"></span> Doctor, literally, “teacher.” See [Eph.
iv. 11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011)<span

<span id="fn_2000"></span>[250:2001](0030280.htm#fr_2000) <span
id="v.iii.xiv-p4.2"></span>

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p5"></span> This seems to be the more probable
meaning of *novissime* in this rather obscure sentence. Oehler treats it
adverbially as “postremo,” and refers to a similar use of the word below
in chap. xxx. Dr. Routh (and, after him, the translator in *The Library
of the Fathers*, Tertullian, p. 448) makes the word a noun, “thou newest
of novices,” and refers to Tertullian’s work, *against Praxeas*, chap.
xxvii., for a like use. This seems to us too harsh for the present
context.
