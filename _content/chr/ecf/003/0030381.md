<span id="v.iv.iv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Prophecy Sets Forth Two
Different Conditions of Christ, One Lowly, the Other Majestic. This Fact
Points to Two Advents of Christ.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.vii-p2"></span>Our heretic will now have the fullest
opportunity of learning the clue <span
id="fr_3179"></span>[3180](#fn_3179) of his errors along with the Jew
himself, from whom he has borrowed his guidance in this discussion.
Since, however, the blind leads the blind, they fall into the ditch
together. We affirm that, as there are two conditions demonstrated by
the prophets to belong to Christ, so these presignified the same number
of advents; one, and that the first, was to be in lowliness, <span
id="fr_3180"></span>[3181](#fn_3180) when He had to be led as a sheep to
be slain as a victim, and to be as a lamb dumb before the shearer, not
opening His mouth, and not fair to look upon. <span
id="fr_3181"></span>[3182](#fn_3181) For, says (the prophet), we have
announced concerning Him: “He is like a tender plant, <span
id="fr_3182"></span>[3183](#fn_3182) like a root out of a thirsty
ground; He hath no form nor comeliness; and we beheld Him, and He was
without beauty:  His form was disfigured;” <span
id="fr_3183"></span>[3184](#fn_3183) “marred more than the sons of men;
a man stricken with sorrows, and knowing how to bear our
infirmity;” <span id="fr_3184"></span>[3185](#fn_3184) “placed by the
Father as a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence;” <span
id="fr_3185"></span>[3186](#fn_3185) “made by Him a little lower than
the angels;” <span id="fr_3186"></span>[3187](#fn_3186) declaring
Himself to be “a worm and not a man, a reproach of men, and despised of
the people.” <span id="fr_3187"></span>[3188](#fn_3187) Now these signs
of degradation quite suit His first coming, just as the tokens of His
majesty do His second advent, when He shall no longer remain “a stone of
stumbling and a rock of offence,” but after His rejection become “the
chief corner-stone,” accepted and elevated to the top place <span
id="fr_3188"></span>[3189](#fn_3188) of the temple, even His church,
being that very stone in Daniel, cut out of the mountain, which was to
smite and crush the image of the secular kingdom. <span
id="fr_3189"></span>[3190](#fn_3189) Of this advent the same prophet
says: “Behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven,
and came to the Ancient of days; and they brought Him before Him, and
there was given Him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people,
nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting
dominion, which shall not pass away; and His kingdom that which shall
not be destroyed.” <span id="fr_3190"></span>[3191](#fn_3190) Then
indeed He shall have both a glorious form, and an unsullied beauty above
the sons of men. “Thou art fairer,” says (the Psalmist), “than the
children of men; grace is poured into Thy lips; therefore God hath
blessed Thee for ever. Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O most mighty,
with Thy glory and Thy majesty.” <span
id="fr_3191"></span>[3192](#fn_3191) For the Father, after making Him a
little lower than the angels, “will crown Him with glory and honour, and
put all things under His feet.” <span
id="fr_3192"></span>[3193](#fn_3192) “Then <span id="page_327">p.
327</span> <span id="v.iv.iv.vii-Page_327"></span>shall they look on Him
whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for Him, tribe after
tribe;” <span id="fr_3193"></span>[3194](#fn_3193) because, no doubt,
they once refused to acknowledge Him in the lowliness of His human
condition. He is even a man, says Jeremiah, and who shall recognise
Him.  Therefore, asks Isaiah, “who shall declare His generation?” <span
id="fr_3194"></span>[3195](#fn_3194) So also in Zechariah, Christ Jesus,
the true High Priest of the Father, in the person of Joshua, nay, in the
very mystery of His name, <span id="fr_3195"></span>[3196](#fn_3195) is
portrayed in a twofold dress with reference to both His advents. At
first He is clad in sordid garments, that is to say, in the lowliness of
suffering and mortal flesh: then the devil resisted Him, as the
instigator of the traitor Judas, not to mention his tempting Him after
His baptism: afterwards He was stripped of His first filthy raiment, and
adorned with the priestly robe <span
id="fr_3196"></span>[3197](#fn_3196) and mitre, and a pure diadem; <span
id="fr_3197"></span>[3198](#fn_3197) in other words, with the glory and
honour of His second advent. <span id="fr_3198"></span>[3199](#fn_3198)
If I may offer, moreover, an interpretation of the two goats which were
presented on “the great day of atonement,” <span
id="fr_3199"></span>[3200](#fn_3199) do they not also figure the two
natures of Christ? They were of like size, and very similar in
appearance, owing to the Lord’s identity of aspect; because He is not to
come in any other form, having to be recognised by those by whom He was
also wounded and pierced. One of these goats was bound <span
id="fr_3200"></span>[3201](#fn_3200) with scarlet, <span
id="fr_3201"></span>[3202](#fn_3201) and driven by the people out of the
camp <span id="fr_3202"></span>[3203](#fn_3202) into the
wilderness, <span id="fr_3203"></span>[3204](#fn_3203) amid cursing, and
spitting, and pulling, and piercing, <span
id="fr_3204"></span>[3205](#fn_3204) being thus marked with all the
signs of the Lord’s own passion; while the other, by being offered up
for sins, and given to the priests of the temple for meat, afforded
proofs of His second appearance, when (after all sins have been
expiated) the priests of the spiritual temple, that is, the church, are
to enjoy the flesh, as it were, <span
id="fr_3205"></span>[3206](#fn_3205) of the Lord’s own grace, whilst the
residue go away from salvation without tasting it. <span
id="fr_3206"></span>[3207](#fn_3206) Since, therefore, the first advent
was prophetically declared both as most obscure in its types, and as
deformed with every kind of indignity, but the second as glorious and
altogether worthy of God, they would on this very account, while
confining their regards to that which they were easily able both to
understand and to believe, even the second advent, be not undeservedly
deceived respecting the more obscure, and, at any rate, the more lowly
first coming.  Accordingly, to this day they deny that their Christ has
come, because He has not appeared in majesty, while they ignore the fact
that He was to come also in lowliness.

<span id="v.iv.iv.vii-p28"></span> This treatment of the scape-goat was
partly ceremonial, partly disorderly. The Mischna (*Yoma* vi. 4–6)
mentions the scarlet ribbon which was bound round the animal’s head
between the horns, and the “pulling” (rather plucking out of its hair);
but this latter was an indignity practised by scoffers and guarded
against by Jews. Tertullian repeats the whole of this passage, *Adv.
Jud*. xiv. Similar use is made of the type of the scape-goat by other
fathers, as Justin Martyr (*Dial. cum Tryph*.) and Cyril of Alex.
(*Epist. ad Acacium*). In this book ix. *Against Julian*, he expressly
says: “Christ was described by the two goats,—as dying for us in the
flesh, and then (as shown by the scape-goat) overcoming death in His
divine nature.”  See Tertullian’s passages illustrated fully in Rabbi
Chiga, *Addit. ad Cod. de die Expiat*. (in Ugolini, *Thes*. i. 88).
