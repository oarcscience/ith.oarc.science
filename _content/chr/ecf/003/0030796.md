<span id="vi.vii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—As God is the Author of Patience So
the Devil is of Impatience.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.v-p2"></span>Nevertheless, the proceeding <span
id="fr_9048"></span>[9049](#fn_9048) of a discussion on the necessaries
of faith is not idle, because it is not unfruitful. In edification no
loquacity is base, if it be base at any time. <span
id="fr_9049"></span>[9050](#fn_9049) And so, if the discourse be
concerning some particular *good*, the subject requires us to review
also the *contrary* of that good. For you will throw more light on what
is to be pursued, if you first give a digest of what is to be avoided.

<span id="vi.vii.v-p5"></span>Let us therefore consider, concerning
*Im*patience, whether just as patience in God, so its adversary quality
have been born and detected in our adversary, that from this
consideration may appear how primarily adverse it is to faith. For that
which has been conceived by God’s rival, of course is not friendly to
God’s things. The discord of *things* is the same as the discord of
their *authors*. Further, since God is best, the devil on the contrary
worst, *of beings*, by their own very diversity they testify that
neither works for <span id="fr_9050"></span>[9051](#fn_9050) the other;
so that anything of good can no more seem to be effected for us by the
Evil One, than anything of evil by the Good. Therefore I detect the
nativity of impatience in the devil himself, at that very time when he
impatiently bore that the Lord God subjected the universal works which
He had made to His own image, that is, to man. <span
id="fr_9051"></span>[9052](#fn_9051) For if he had endured (that), he
would not have grieved; nor would he have envied man if he had not
grieved. Accordingly he deceived him, because he had envied him; but he
had envied because he had grieved: he had grieved because, of course, he
had not patiently borne. What that angel of perdition <span
id="fr_9052"></span>[9053](#fn_9052) first was—malicious or impatient—I
scorn to inquire: since manifest it is that either impatience took its
rise *together with* malice, or else malice *from* impatience; that
subsequently they conspired between themselves; and that they grew up
indivisible in one paternal bosom. But, however, having been instructed,
by his own experiment, what an aid unto sinning was that which he had
been the first to feel, and by means of which he <span id="page_710">p.
710</span> <span id="vi.vii.v-Page_710"></span>had entered on his course
of delinquency, he called the same to his assistance for the thrusting
of man into crime. The woman, <span id="fr_9053"></span>[9054](#fn_9053)
immediately on being met by him—I may say so without rashness—was,
through his very speech with her, breathed on by a spirit infected with
impatience: so certain is it that she would never have sinned at all, if
she had honoured the divine edict by maintaining her patience to the
end. What (of the fact) that she endured not to have been met alone; but
in the presence of Adam, not yet her husband, not yet bound to lend her
his ears, <span id="fr_9054"></span>[9055](#fn_9054) she is impatient of
keeping silence, and makes him the transmitter of that which she had
imbibed from the Evil One?  Therefore another human being, too, perishes
through the impatience of the one; presently, too, perishes of himself,
through his own impatience committed in each respect, both in regard of
God’s premonition and in regard of the devil’s cheatery; not enduring to
observe the former nor to refute the latter. Hence, whence (the origin)
of delinquency, arose the first origin of judgment; hence, whence man
was induced to offend, God began to be wroth. Whence (came) the first
indignation in God, thence (came) His first patience; who, content at
that time with malediction only, refrained in the devil’s case from the
instant infliction <span id="fr_9055"></span>[9056](#fn_9055) of
punishment. Else what crime, before this guilt of impatience, is imputed
to man?  Innocent he was, and in intimate friendship with God, and the
husbandman <span id="fr_9056"></span>[9057](#fn_9056) of paradise. But
when once he succumbed to impatience, he quite ceased to be of sweet
savour <span id="fr_9057"></span>[9058](#fn_9057) to God; he quite
ceased to be able to endure things celestial. Thenceforward, a
creature <span id="fr_9058"></span>[9059](#fn_9058) given to earth, and
ejected from the sight of God, he begins to be easily turned by
impatience unto every use offensive to God. For straightway that
*impatience* conceived of the devil’s seed, produced, in the fecundity
of malice, anger as her son; and when brought forth, trained him in her
own arts. For that very thing which had immersed Adam and Eve in death,
taught their son, too, to begin with murder. It would be idle for me to
ascribe this to impatience, if Cain, that first homicide and first
fratricide, had borne with equanimity and not impatiently the refusal by
the Lord of his own oblations—if he is not wroth with his own
brother—if, finally, he took away no one’s life. Since, then, he could
neither have killed unless he had been wroth, nor have been wroth unless
he had been impatient, he demonstrates that what he did through wrath
must be referred to that by which wrath was suggested during this
cradle-time of impatience, then (in a certain sense) in her infancy. 
But how great presently were her augmentations! And no wonder, If she
has been the first delinquent, it is a consequence that, because she
*has* been the first, therefore she is the only parent stem, <span
id="fr_9059"></span>[9060](#fn_9059) too, to *every* delinquency,
pouring down from her own fount various veins of crimes. <span
id="fr_9060"></span>[9061](#fn_9060) Of *murder* we have spoken; but,
being from the very beginning the outcome of *anger*, <span
id="fr_9061"></span>[9062](#fn_9061) whatever causes besides it shortly
found for itself it lays collectively on the account of impatience, as
to its own origin.  For whether from *private enmities*, or for the sake
of *prey*, any one perpetrates that wickedness, <span
id="fr_9062"></span>[9063](#fn_9062) the earlier step is his becoming
*impatient of* <span id="fr_9063"></span>[9064](#fn_9063) either the
hatred or the avarice.  Whatever *compels* a man, it is not possible
that without *impatience of itself* it can be perfected in *deed*. Who
*ever* committed *adultery* without impatience of *lust*? Moreover, if
in females the sale of their modesty is forced by the price, of course
it is by impatience of contemning gain <span
id="fr_9064"></span>[9065](#fn_9064) that *this sale* is
regulated. <span id="fr_9065"></span>[9066](#fn_9065) These (I mention)
as the principal delinquencies in the sight of the Lord, <span
id="fr_9066"></span>[9067](#fn_9066) for, to speak compendiously,
*every* sin is ascribable to impatience. “Evil” is “impatience of good.”
None *immodest* is not *impatient of modesty; dishonest* of *honesty;
impious* of *piety*; <span id="fr_9067"></span>[9068](#fn_9067)
*unquiet* of *quietness*. In order that each individual may become
*evil* he will be *unable to persevere* <span
id="fr_9068"></span>[9069](#fn_9068) in being *good*. How, therefore,
can such a hydra of delinquencies fail to offend the Lord, the
Disapprover of evils? Is it not manifest that it was through impatience
that Israel himself also always failed in his duty toward God, from that
time when, <span id="fr_9069"></span>[9070](#fn_9069) forgetful of the
heavenly arm whereby he had been drawn out of his Egyptian affliction,
he demands from Aaron “gods <span id="fr_9070"></span>[9071](#fn_9070)
as his guides;” when he pours down for an idol the contributions of his
gold: for the so necessary delays of Moses, while he met with God, he
had borne with impatience. After the edible rain <span id="page_711">p.
711</span> <span id="vi.vii.v-Page_711"></span>of the manna, after the
watery following <span id="fr_9071"></span>[9072](#fn_9071) of the rock,
they despair of the Lord in not enduring a three-days’ thirst; <span
id="fr_9072"></span>[9073](#fn_9072) for this also is laid to their
charge by the Lord as impatience. And—not to rove through individual
cases—there was no instance in which it was not by failing in duty
through impatience that they perished. How, moreover, did they lay hands
on the prophets, except through impatience of hearing them? on the Lord
moreover Himself, through impatience likewise of seeing Him? But had
they entered *the path of* patience, they would have been set
free. <span id="fr_9073"></span>[9074](#fn_9073)

<span id="vi.vii.v-p3"></span> “Procedere:” so Oehler, who, however,
notices an ingenious conjecture of Jos. Scaliger—“procudere,” the
hammering out, or forging.

tells us) has suggested a neat emendation—“favere,” favours.
