<span id="vi.iv.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Answer to the Foregoing
Arguments.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii-p2"></span>They who make this concession <span
id="fr_8873"></span>[8874](#fn_8873) ought to reflect on the nature of
the word itself—what is the meaning of “woman” from the very first
records of the sacred writings. Here they find it to be the *name of the
sex*, not a *class of the sex*: if, that is, God gave to Eve, when she
had not yet known a man, the surname “woman” and “female” <span
id="fr_8874"></span>[8875](#fn_8874) —(“female,” whereby the sex
generally; “woman,” hereby a class of the sex, is marked). <span
id="fr_8875"></span>[8876](#fn_8875) So, since at that time the as yet
unwedded Eve was called by the word “woman,” that word has been made
common even to a virgin. <span id="fr_8876"></span>[8877](#fn_8876) Nor
is it wonderful that the apostle—guided, of course, by the same Spirit
by whom, as all the divine Scripture, so that book Genesis, was drawn
up—has used the selfsame word in writing “women,” which, by the example
of Eve unwedded, is applicable too to a “virgin.” In fact, all the other
passages are in consonance herewith. For even by this very fact, that he
has not *named* “virgins” (as he does in another place <span
id="fr_8877"></span>[8878](#fn_8877) where he is teaching touching
marrying), he sufficiently predicates that his remark is made touching
*every* woman, and touching *the whole* sex; and that there is no
distinction made between a “virgin” *and any other*, while he does not
name her at all. For he who elsewhere—namely, where the difference
requires—remembers to make the distinction, (moreover, he makes it by
designating each species by their appropriate names,) wishes, where he
makes *no* distinction (while he does not name each), *no* difference to
be understood. What of the fact that in the Greek speech, in which the
apostle wrote his letters, it is usual to say, “women” rather than
“females;” that is, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii-p7.2"></span>γυναῖκας</span> <span id="page_688">p.
688</span> <span id="vi.iv.xxii-Page_688"></span>(*gunaikas*) rather
than <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii-p7.3"></span>θηλείας</span> (*theleias*)? Therefore if
that word, <span id="fr_8878"></span>[8879](#fn_8878) which by
interpretation represents what “female” (*femina*) represents, <span
id="fr_8879"></span>[8880](#fn_8879) is frequently used *instead* of the
name of the sex, <span id="fr_8880"></span>[8881](#fn_8880) he has named
the *sex* in saying <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii-p10.2"></span>γυναῖκα</span>; but in the *sex* even the
*virgin* is embraced. But, withal, the declaration is plain: “*Every*
woman,” saith he, “praying and prophesying with head uncovered, <span
id="fr_8881"></span>[8882](#fn_8881) dishonoureth her own head.” <span
id="fr_8882"></span>[8883](#fn_8882) What is “*every* woman,” but
*woman* of every age, of every rank, of every condition? By saying
“every” he excepts nought of womanhood, just as he excepts nought of
manhood either from *not* being covered; for just so he says, “*Every
man*.” <span id="fr_8883"></span>[8884](#fn_8883) As, then, in the
masculine sex, under the name of “man” even the “youth” is *forbidden*
to be veiled; so, too, in the feminine, under the name of “woman,” even
the “virgin” is *bidden* to be veiled. Equally in each sex let the
younger age follow the discipline of the elder; or else let the male
“virgins,” <span id="fr_8884"></span>[8885](#fn_8884) too, be *veiled*,
if the female virgins withal are *not* veiled, because *they* are not
mentioned by *name*.  Let “man” and “youth” be different, if “woman” and
“virgin” are different. For indeed it is “on account of the
angels” <span id="fr_8885"></span>[8886](#fn_8885) that he saith women
must be veiled, because on account of “the daughters of men” angels
revolted from God. <span id="fr_8886"></span>[8887](#fn_8886) Who then,
would contend that “*women*” *alone*—that is, <span
id="fr_8887"></span>[8888](#fn_8887) such as were already wedded and had
lost their virginity—were the objects of angelic concupiscence, unless
“virgins” are incapable of excelling in beauty and finding lovers? Nay,
let us see whether it were not *virgins alone* whom they lusted after;
since Scriptures saith “*the daughters* of men;” <span
id="fr_8888"></span>[8889](#fn_8888) inasmuch as it might have named
“*wives* of men,” or “females,” indifferently. <span
id="fr_8889"></span>[8890](#fn_8889) Likewise, in that it saith, “And
they took them to themselves for wives,” <span
id="fr_8890"></span>[8891](#fn_8890) it does so on this ground, that, of
course, such are “received *for wives*” as are devoid of that title. But
it would have expressed itself differently concerning such as were *not*
thus devoid. And so (they who are named) are devoid as much of
*widowhood* as of *virginity*. So completely has *Paul* by naming the
sex generally, mingled “daughters” and species together in the genus.
Again, while he says that “nature herself,” <span
id="fr_8891"></span>[8892](#fn_8891) which has assigned hair as a
tegument and ornament to women, “teaches that veiling is the duty of
females,” has not the same tegument and the same honour of the head been
assigned also to virgins?  If “it is shameful” for a woman to be shorn
it is similarly so to a virgin too. From them, then, to whom is assigned
one and the same *law* of the head, <span
id="fr_8892"></span>[8893](#fn_8892) one and the same *discipline* <span
id="fr_8893"></span>[8894](#fn_8893) of the head is exacted,—(which
extends) even unto those virgins whom their childhood defends, <span
id="fr_8894"></span>[8895](#fn_8894) for from the first <span
id="fr_8895"></span>[8896](#fn_8895) *a virgin* was named “female.” This
custom, <span id="fr_8896"></span>[8897](#fn_8896) in short, even Israel
observes; but if *Israel* did *not* observe it, *our* Law, <span
id="fr_8897"></span>[8898](#fn_8897) amplified and supplemented, would
vindicate the addition for itself; let it be excused for imposing the
veil on virgins also.  Under *our* dispensation, let that age which is
ignorant of its sex <span id="fr_8898"></span>[8899](#fn_8898) retain
the privilege of simplicity. For both Eve and Adam, when it befell them
to be “wise,” <span id="fr_8899"></span>[8900](#fn_8899) forthwith
veiled what they had learnt to know. <span
id="fr_8900"></span>[8901](#fn_8900) At all events, with regard to those
in whom girlhood has changed (into maturity), their age ought to
remember its duties as to nature, so also, to discipline; for they are
being transferred to the rank of “women” both in their persons and in
their functions. No one is a “virgin” from the time when she is capable
of marriage; seeing that, in her, age has by that time been wedded to
its own husband, that is, to time. <span
id="fr_8901"></span>[8902](#fn_8901) “But some particular *virgin* has
devoted herself to God.  From that very moment she both changes the
fashion of her hair, and converts all her garb into that of a ‘woman.’” 
Let her, then, maintain the character wholly, and perform the whole
function of a “virgin:” what she conceals <span
id="fr_8902"></span>[8903](#fn_8902) for the sake of God, let her cover
quite over. <span id="fr_8903"></span>[8904](#fn_8903) It is our
business to entrust to the knowledge of God alone that which the grace
of God effects in us, lest we receive from man the reward we hope for
from God. <span id="fr_8904"></span>[8905](#fn_8904) Why do you denude
before God <span id="fr_8905"></span>[8906](#fn_8905) what you cover
<span id="page_689">p. 689</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxii-Page_689"></span>before men? <span
id="fr_8906"></span>[8907](#fn_8906) Will you be more modest in public
than in the church? If *your self-devotion* is a grace of God, and you
have received it, “why do you boast,” saith he, “as if you have not
received it?” <span id="fr_8907"></span>[8908](#fn_8907) Why, by your
ostentation of yourself, do you judge others? Is it that, by your
boasting, you invite others unto good?  Nay, but even you yourself run
the risk of losing, if you boast; and you drive others unto the same
perils! What is assumed from love of boasting is easily destroyed. Be
veiled, virgin, if virgin you are; for you ought to blush. If you are a
virgin, shrink from (the gaze of) many eyes. Let no one wonder at your
face; let no one perceive your falsehood. <span
id="fr_8908"></span>[8909](#fn_8908) You do well in falsely assuming the
married character, if you veil your head; nay, you do not seem to assume
it *falsely*, for you *are* wedded to Christ: to Him you have
surrendered your body; act as becomes your Husband’s discipline. If He
bids the brides of others to be veiled, His own, of course, much more.
“But each individual man <span id="fr_8909"></span>[8910](#fn_8909) is
not to think that the institution of his predecessor is to be
overturned.” Many yield up their own judgment, and its consistency, to
the custom of others. Granted that *virgins* be not *compelled* to be
veiled, at all events such as *voluntarily are* so should not be
prohibited; who, likewise, cannot deny themselves to be virgins, <span
id="fr_8910"></span>[8911](#fn_8910) content, in the security of a good
conscience before God, to damage their own fame. <span
id="fr_8911"></span>[8912](#fn_8911) Touching such, however, as are
betrothed, I can with constancy “above my small measure” <span
id="fr_8912"></span>[8913](#fn_8912) pronounce and attest that they are
to be veiled from that day forth on which they shuddered at the first
bodily touch of a man by kiss and hand. For in them everything has been
forewedded: their age, through maturity; their flesh, through age; their
spirit, through consciousness; their modesty, through the experience of
the kiss their hope, through expectation; their mind through volition.
And Rebecca is example enough for us, who, when her betrothed had been
pointed out, veiled herself for marriage merely on recognition of
him. <span id="fr_8913"></span>[8914](#fn_8913)

In the LXX. and in the Eng. ver. there is but the one word “woman.”

id="vi.iv.xxii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii-p5"></span> These words are regarded by Dr. Routh
as spurious, and not without reason. Mr. Dodgson likewise omits them,

<span id="vi.iv.xxii-p6"></span> In *de Virg. Vel.* 5, Tertullian speaks
even more strongly: “And so you have the name, I say not now *common*,
but *proper* to a virgin; a name which from the beginning a *virgin*
received.”

<span id="vi.iv.xxii-p9"></span> Mr. Dodgson appears to think that there
is some transposition here; and at first sight it may appear so. But
when we look more closely, perhaps there is no need to make any
difficulty: the stress is rather on the words “by *interpretation*,”
which, of course, is a different thing from “*usage*;” and by
*interpretation* <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii-p9.1"></span>γυνή</span> appears to come *nearer* to
“femina” than to “mulier.”

the eternal favour of God, which we hope for, to the temporal veneration
of men; a risk which those virgins seemed likely to run who, when

church.”

<span id="vi.iv.xxii-p41"></span> “By appearing in public as married
women, while in heart they are virgins” (Oehler).

<span id="vi.iv.xxii-p42"></span> Does Tertullian refer to [2 Cor. x.
13](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#013)<span id="vi.iv.xxii-p42.1"></span>?
or does “modulus” mean, as Oehler thinks, “my rule?” \[It seems to me a
very plain reference to the text before mentioned, and to the Apostolic
Canon of not exceeding one’s Mission.\]
