<span id="iv.viii.ii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—The Constellations and the
Genii Very Indifferent Gods. The Roman Monopoly of Gods Unsatisfactory.
Other Nations Require Deities Quite as Much.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xv-p2"></span>It would be tedious to take a survey
of all those, too, whom you have buried amongst the constellations, and
audaciously minister to as gods. <span
id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056) I suppose your Castors, and
Perseus, and Erigona, <span id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057) have
just the same claims for the honours of the sky as Jupiter’s own big
boy <span id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058) had. But why should we
wonder? You have transferred to heaven even dogs, and scorpions, and
crabs. I postpone all remarks <span id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059)
concerning those whom you worship in your oracles. That this worship
exists, is attested by him who pronounces the oracle. <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060) Why; you will have your gods to be
spectators even of sadness, <span id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061)
as is Viduus, who makes a *widow* of the soul, by parting it from the
body, and whom you have condemned, by not permitting him to be enclosed
within your city-walls; there is Cæculus also, to deprive the eyes of
their perception; and Orbana, to bereave seed of its vital power;
moreover, there is the goddess of death herself. To pass hastily by all
others, <span id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062) you account as gods
the sites of places or of the city; such are Father Janus (there being,
moreover, the archer-goddess <span id="fr_1063"></span>[1064](#fn_1063)
Jana <span id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064) ), and Septimontius of
the seven hills.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xv-p12"></span>Men sacrifice <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065) to the same *Genii*, whilst <span
id="page_145">p. 145</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.xv-Page_145"></span>they have altars or temples in the
same places; but to others besides, when they dwell in a strange place,
or live in rented houses. <span id="fr_1066"></span>[1067](#fn_1066) I
say nothing about Ascensus, who gets his name for his *climbing*
propensity, and Clivicola, from her sloping (haunts); I pass silently by
the deities called Forculus from doors, and Cardea from hinges, and
Limentinus the god of thresholds, and whatever others are worshipped by
your neighbours as tutelar deities of their street doors. <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067) There is nothing strange in this,
since men have their respective gods in their brothels, their kitchens,
and even in their prison. Heaven, therefore, is crowded with innumerable
gods of its own, both these and others belonging to the Romans, which
have distributed amongst them the functions of one’s whole life, in such
a way that there is no want of the other <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068) gods. Although, it is true, <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069) the gods which we have enumerated
are reckoned as Roman peculiarly, and as not easily recognised abroad;
yet how do all those functions and circumstances, over which men have
willed their gods to preside, come about, <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070) in every part of the human race,
and in every nation, where their guarantees <span
id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071) are not only without an official
recognition, but even any recognition at all?

almost unintelligible sentence, which we subjoin: “Geniis eisdem illi
faciunt qui in isdem locis aras vel ædes habent; præterea aliis qui in
alieno loco aut mercedibus habitant.” Oehler, who makes this text,
supposes that in each clause the name of some god has dropped out.
