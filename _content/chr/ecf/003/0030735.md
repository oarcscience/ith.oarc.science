<span id="vi.iii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Another Objection: Abraham
Pleased God Without Being Baptized. Answer Thereto. Old Things Must Give
Place to New, and Baptism is Now a Law.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xiii-p2"></span>Here, then, those miscreants <span
id="fr_8677"></span>[8678](#fn_8677) provoke <span id="page_676">p.
676</span> <span id="vi.iii.xiii-Page_676"></span>questions. And so they
say, “Baptism is not necessary for them to whom faith is sufficient; for
withal, Abraham pleased God by a sacrament of no water, but of faith.”
But in all cases it is the *later* things which have a conclusive force,
and the *subsequent* which prevail over the antecedent. Grant that, in
days gone by, there was salvation by means of bare faith, before the
passion and resurrection of the Lord. But now that faith has been
enlarged, and is become a faith which believes in His nativity, passion,
and resurrection, there has been an amplification added to the
sacrament, <span id="fr_8678"></span>[8679](#fn_8678) viz., the sealing
act of baptism; the clothing, in some sense, of the faith which before
was bare, and which cannot exist now without its proper law. For the
*law* of baptizing has been *imposed*, and the formula prescribed: “Go,”
*He* saith, “teach the nations, baptizing them into the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” <span
id="fr_8679"></span>[8680](#fn_8679) The comparison with this law of
that definition, “Unless a man have been reborn of water and Spirit, he
shall not enter into the kingdom of the heavens,” <span
id="fr_8680"></span>[8681](#fn_8680) has tied faith to the necessity of
baptism.  Accordingly, all thereafter <span
id="fr_8681"></span>[8682](#fn_8681) *who became* believers used to be
baptized. *Then* it was, too, <span id="fr_8682"></span>[8683](#fn_8682)
that Paul, when he believed, was baptized; and this is the meaning of
the precept which the Lord had given him when smitten with the plague of
loss *of sight*, saying, “Arise, and enter Damascus; there shall be
demonstrated to thee what thou oughtest to do,” to wit—be baptized,
which was the only thing lacking to him. That point excepted, he had
sufficiently *learnt and believed* “the Nazarene” to be “the Lord, the
Son of God.” <span id="fr_8683"></span>[8684](#fn_8683)
