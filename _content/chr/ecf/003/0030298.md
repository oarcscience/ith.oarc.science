<span id="v.iii.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—None of the Heretics Claim
Succession from the Apostles. New Churches Still Apostolic, Because
Their Faith is that Which the Apostles Taught and Handed Down. The
Heretics Challenged to Show Any Apostolic Credentials.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxxii-p2"></span>But if there be any (heresies) which
are bold enough to plant themselves in the midst of the apostolic age,
that they may thereby seem to have been handed down by the apostles,
because they existed in the time of the apostles, we can say: Let them
produce the original records <span id="fr_2180"></span>[2181](#fn_2180)
of their churches; let them unfold the roll of their bishops, running
down in due succession from the beginning in such a manner that \[that
first bishop of theirs <span id="fr_2181"></span>[2182](#fn_2181) \]
bishop shall be able to show for his ordainer and predecessor some one
of the apostles or of apostolic men,—a man, moreover, who continued
stedfast with the apostles. For this is the manner in which the
apostolic churches transmit <span id="fr_2182"></span>[2183](#fn_2182)
their registers: <span id="fr_2183"></span>[2184](#fn_2183) as the
church of Smyrna, which records that Polycarp was placed therein by
John; as also the church of Rome, which makes Clement to have been
ordained in like manner by Peter. <span
id="fr_2184"></span>[2185](#fn_2184) In exactly the same way the other
churches likewise exhibit (their several worthies), whom, as having been
appointed to their episcopal places by apostles, they regard as
transmitters of the apostolic seed. Let the heretics contrive <span
id="fr_2185"></span>[2186](#fn_2185) something of the same kind. For
after their blasphemy, what is there that is unlawful for them (to
attempt)? But should they even effect the contrivance, they will not
advance a step. For their very doctrine, after comparison with that of
the apostles, will declare, by its own diversity and contrariety, that
it had for its author neither an apostle nor an apostolic man; because,
as the apostles would never have taught things which were
self-contradictory, so the apostolic men would not have inculcated
teaching different from the apostles, unless they who received their
instruction from the apostles went and preached in a contrary manner. To
this test, therefore will they be submitted for proof <span
id="fr_2186"></span>[2187](#fn_2186) by those churches, who, although
they derive not their founder from apostles or apostolic men (as being
of much later date, for they are in fact being founded daily), yet,
since they agree in the same faith, they are accounted as not less
apostolic because they are akin in doctrine. <span
id="fr_2187"></span>[2188](#fn_2187) Then let all the heresies, when
challenged to these two <span id="fr_2188"></span>[2189](#fn_2188) tests
by our apostolic church, offer their proof of how they deem themselves
to be apostolic. But in truth they neither are so, nor are they able to
prove themselves to be what they are not. Nor are they admitted to
peaceful relations and communion by such churches as are in any way
connected with apostles, inasmuch as they are in no sense themselves
apostolic because of their diversity as to the mysteries of the
faith. <span id="fr_2189"></span>[2190](#fn_2189)
