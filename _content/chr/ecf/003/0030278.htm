<p class="c30"><a name="v.iii.xii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="v.iii.xii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XII.&#8212;A Proper Seeking After Divine Knowledge, Which Will Never Be Out of Place or Excessive, is Always Within the Rule of Faith.</span></p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="v.iii.xii-p2"></A>As for us, although we must still seek, and <i>that</i> always, yet where ought our search to be made?&#160; Amongst the heretics, where all things are foreign&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1988"></A><A HREF="#fn_1988"><FONT SIZE="1">1989</FONT></A>
 and opposed to our own verity, and to whom we are forbidden to draw near? What slave looks for food from a stranger, not to say an enemy of his master? What soldier expects to get bounty and pay from kings who are unallied, I might almost say hostile&#8212;unless forsooth he be a deserter, and a runaway, and a rebel? Even that old woman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1989"></A><A HREF="#fn_1989"><FONT SIZE="1">1990</FONT></A>
 searched for the piece of silver within her own house. It was also at his neighbour&#146;s door that the persevering assailant kept knocking. Nor was it to a hostile judge, although a severe one, that the widow made her appeal. No man gets instruction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1990"></A><A HREF="#fn_1990"><FONT SIZE="1">1991</FONT></A>
 from that which tends to destruction.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1991"></A><A HREF="#fn_1991"><FONT SIZE="1">1992</FONT></A>
 No man receives illumination from a quarter where all is darkness. Let our &#8220;seeking,&#8221; therefore be in that which is our own, and from those who are our own: and concerning that which is our own,&#8212;that, and only that,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1992"></A><A HREF="#fn_1992"><FONT SIZE="1">1993</FONT></A>
 which can become an object of inquiry without impairing the rule of faith.</p>
