<span id="v.iv.ii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Marcion, Justifying His
Antithesis Between the Law and the Gospel by the Contention of St. Paul
with St. Peter, Shown to Have Mistaken St. Paul’s Position and Argument.
Marcion’s Doctrine Confuted Out of St. Paul’s Teaching, Which Agrees
Wholly with the Creator’s Decrees.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xx-p2"></span>This most patent conclusion requires to
be defended by us against the clamours of the opposite side. For they
allege that Marcion did not so much innovate on the rule (of faith) by
his separation of the law and the gospel, as restore it after it had
been previously adulterated. O Christ, <span
id="fr_2552"></span>[2553](#fn_2552) most enduring Lord, who didst bear
so many years with this interference with Thy revelation, until Marcion
forsooth came to Thy rescue! Now they adduce the case of Peter himself,
and the others, who were pillars of the apostolate, as having been
blamed by Paul for not walking uprightly, according to the truth of the
gospel—that very Paul indeed, who, being yet in the mere rudiments of
grace, and trembling, in short, lest he should have run or were still
running in vain, then for the first time held intercourse with those who
were apostles before himself. Therefore because, in the eagerness of his
zeal against Judaism as a neophyte, he thought that there was something
to be blamed in their conduct—even the promiscuousness of their
conversation <span id="fr_2553"></span>[2554](#fn_2553) —but afterwards
was himself to become in his practice all things to all men, that he
might gain all,—to the Jews, as a Jew, and to them that were under the
law, as under the law,—you would have his censure, which was merely
directed against conduct destined to become acceptable even to their
accuser, suspected of prevarication against God on a point of public
doctrine. <span id="fr_2554"></span>[2555](#fn_2554) Touching their
public doctrine, however, they had, as we have already said, joined
hands in perfect concord, and had agreed also in the division of their
labour in their fellowship of the gospel, as they had indeed in all
other respects: <span id="fr_2555"></span>[2556](#fn_2555) “Whether it
were I or they, so we preach.” <span
id="fr_2556"></span>[2557](#fn_2556) When, again, he mentioned “certain
false brethren as having crept in unawares,” who wished to remove the
Galatians into another gospel, <span
id="fr_2557"></span>[2558](#fn_2557) he himself shows that that
adulteration of the gospel was not meant to transfer them to the faith
of another god and christ, but rather to perpetuate the teaching of the
law; because he blames them for maintaining circumcision, and observing
times, and days, and months, and years, according to those Jewish
ceremonies which they ought to have known were now abrogated, according
to the new dispensation purposed by the Creator Himself, who of old
foretold this very thing by His prophets. Thus He says by Isaiah: Old
things have passed away. “Behold, I will do a new thing.” <span
id="fr_2558"></span>[2559](#fn_2558) And in another passage: “I will
make a new covenant, not according to the covenant that I made with
their fathers, when I brought them out of the land of <span
id="page_286">p. 286</span> <span
id="v.iv.ii.xx-Page_286"></span>Egypt.” <span
id="fr_2559"></span>[2560](#fn_2559) In like manner by Jeremiah: Make to
yourselves a new covenant, “circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take
away the foreskins of your heart.” <span
id="fr_2560"></span>[2561](#fn_2560) It is this circumcision, therefore,
and this renewal, which the apostle insisted on, when he forbade those
ancient ceremonies concerning which their very founder announced that
they were one day to cease; thus by Hosea: “I will also cause all her
mirth to cease, her feast-days, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all
her solemn feasts.” <span id="fr_2561"></span>[2562](#fn_2561) So
likewise by Isaiah: “The new moons, and Sabbaths, the calling of
assemblies, I cannot away with; your holy days, and fasts, and
feast-days, my soul hateth.” <span id="fr_2562"></span>[2563](#fn_2562)
Now, if even the Creator had so long before discarded all these things,
and the apostle was now proclaiming them to be worthy of renunciation,
the very agreement of the apostle’s meaning with the decrees of the
Creator proves that none other God was preached by the apostle than He
whose purposes he now wished to have recognised, branding as false both
apostles and brethren, for the express reason that they were pushing
back the gospel of Christ the Creator from the new condition which the
Creator had foretold, to the old one which He had discarded.
