<span id="iv.iv.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Of Silent Acquiescence in
Heathen Formularies.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xxi-p2"></span>But it is a mark of timidity, when some
other man binds you in the name of his gods, by the making of an oath,
or by some other form of attestation, and you, for fear of
discovery, <span id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329) remain quiet. For you
equally, by remaining quiet, affirm their majesty, by reason of which
*majesty* you will seem to be bound.  What matters it, whether you
affirm the gods of the nations by calling them gods, or by hearing them
so called?  Whether you swear by idols, or, when adjured by another,
acquiesce? Why should we not recognize the subtleties of Satan, who
makes it his aim that, what he cannot effect by *our* mouth, he may
effect by the mouth of his servants, introducing idolatry into us
through our ears? At all events, whoever the adjurer is, he binds you to
himself either in friendly or unfriendly conjunction. If in unfriendly,
you are now challenged unto battle, and know that you must fight. If in
friendly, with how far greater security will you transfer your
engagement unto the Lord, that you may dissolve the obligation of him
through whose means the Evil One was seeking to annex you to the honour
of idols, that is, to idolatry!  All sufferance of that kind is
idolatry.  You honour those to whom, when imposed as authorities, you
have rendered respect. I know that one (whom the Lord pardon!), when it
had been said to him in public during a law-suit, “Jupiter be wroth with
you,” answered, “On the contrary, with *you*.” What else would a heathen
have done who believed Jupiter to be a god? For even had he not retorted
the malediction by Jupiter (or other such like), yet, *by merely*
returning a curse, he would have confirmed the divinity of Jove, showing
himself irritated by a malediction in Jove’s name. For what is there to
be indignant at, (if cursed) in the name of one whom you know to be
nothing? For if you rave, you immediately affirm his existence, and the
profession of your fear will be an act of idolatry. How much more, while
you are returning the malediction in the name of Jupiter himself, are
you doing honour to Jupiter in the same way as he who provoked you! But
a believer ought to laugh in such cases, not to rave; nay, according to
the precept, <span id="fr_330"></span>[331](#fn_330) not to return a
curse in the name of God even, but dearly to *bless* in the name of God,
that you may both demolish idols and preach God, and fulfil discipline.
