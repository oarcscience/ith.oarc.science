<span id="iv.viii.i.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX. <span
id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749) —If Christians and the Heathen Thus
Resemble Each Other, There is Great Difference in the Grounds and Nature
of Their Apparently Similar Conduct.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xix-p3"></span>Here end, I suppose, your tremendous
charges of obstinacy against the Christians. Now, since we are amenable
to them in common with yourselves, it only remains that we compare the
grounds which the respective parties have for being personally derided.
All our obstinacy, however, is with you a foregone conclusion, <span
id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750) based on our strong convictions; for
we take for granted <span id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751) a
resurrection of the dead. Hope in this resurrection amounts to <span
id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752) a contempt of death. Ridicule,
therefore, as much as you like the excessive stupidity of such minds as
die that they may live; but then, in order that you may be able to laugh
more merrily, and deride us with greater boldness, you must take your
sponge, or perhaps your tongue, and wipe away those records of yours
every now and then cropping out, <span id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753)
which assert in not dissimilar terms that souls will return to bodies.
But how much more worthy of acceptance is our belief which maintains
that they will return to the same bodies! And how much more ridiculous
is your inherited conceit, <span id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754) that
the human spirit is to reappear in a dog, or a mule, or a peacock!
Again, we affirm that a judgment has been ordained by God according to
the merits of every man. This you ascribe to Minos and Rhadamanthus,
while at the same time *you* reject Aristides, who was a juster judge
than either.  By the award of the judgment, we say that the wicked will
have to spend an eternity in endless fire, the pious and innocent in a
region of bliss. In your view likewise an unalterable condition is
ascribed to the respective destinations of Pyriphlegethon <span
id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755) and Elysium. Now they are not merely
your composers of myth and poetry who write songs of this strain; but
your philosophers also speak with all confidence of the return of souls
to their former state, <span id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756) and of
the twofold award <span id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757) of a final
judgment.
