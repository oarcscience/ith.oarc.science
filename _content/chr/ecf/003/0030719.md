<span id="vi.ii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.ii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Further Strictures on the Same
Subject.</span>

<span id="vi.ii.xi-p2"></span>What if, besides the shame which they make
the most account of, *men* dread likewise the bodily inconveniences; in
that, unwashen, sordidly attired, estranged from gladness, they must
spend their time in the roughness of sackcloth, and the horridness of
ashes, and the sunkenness of face caused by fasting? Is it then becoming
for us to supplicate for our sins in scarlet and purple?  Hasten hither
with the pin for panning the hair, and the powder for polishing the
teeth, and some forked implement of steel or brass for cleaning the
nails. Whatever of false brilliance, whatever of feigned redness, *is to
be had*, let him diligently apply it to his lips or cheeks. Let him
furthermore seek out baths of more genial temperature in some gardened
or seaside retreat; let him enlarge his expenses; let him carefully seek
the rarest delicacy of fatted fowls; let him refine his old wine: and
when any shall ask him, “On whom are you lavishing all this?” let him
say, “I have sinned against God, and am in peril of eternally perishing:
and so now I am drooping, and wasting and torturing myself, that I may
reconcile God to myself, whom by sinning I have offended.” Why, they who
go about canvassing for the obtaining of civil office, feel it neither
degrading nor irksome to struggle, in behalf of such their desires, with
annoyances to soul and body; and not annoyances merely, but likewise
contumelies of all kinds. What meannesses of dress do they not affect?
what houses do they not beset with early and late visits?—bowing
whenever they meet any high personage, frequenting no banquets,
associating in no entertainments, but voluntarily exiled from the
felicity of freedom and festivity: and all that for the sake of the
fleeting joy of a single year! Do *we* hesitate, when eternity is at
stake, to endure what the competitor for consulship or prætorship puts
up with? <span id="fr_8521"></span>[8522](#fn_8521) and shall we be
tardy in offering to the offended Lord a self-chastisement in food and
raiment, which <span id="fr_8522"></span>[8523](#fn_8522) Gentiles lay
upon themselves when they have offended no one at all? Such are they of
whom Scripture makes mention: “Woe to them who bind their own sins as it
were with a long rope.” <span id="fr_8523"></span>[8524](#fn_8523)
