<span id="v.v.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—Some Hair-Splitting Use of
Words in Which His Opponent Had Indulged.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxvii-p2"></span>But you next praise your eyebrows, and
toss back your head, and beckon with your finger, in characteristic
disdain, <span id="fr_6384"></span>[6385](#fn_6384) and say: There is
the *was*, looking as if it pointed to an eternal existence,—making its
subject, of course, unbegotten and unmade, and on that account worthy of
being supposed to be Matter. Well now, for my own part, I shall resort
to no affected protestation, <span id="fr_6385"></span>[6386](#fn_6385)
but simply reply that “*was*” may be predicated of everything—even of a
thing which has been created, which was born, which once was not, and
which is not *your* Matter. For of everything which has being, from
whatever source it has it, whether it has it by a beginning or without a
beginning, the word “*was*” will be predicated from the very fact that
it exists. To whatever thing the first tense <span
id="fr_6386"></span>[6387](#fn_6386) of the verb is applicable for
*definition*, to the same will be suitable the later form <span
id="fr_6387"></span>[6388](#fn_6387) of the verb, when it has to descend
to *relation*. “Est” (it is) forms the essential part <span
id="fr_6388"></span>[6389](#fn_6388) of a definition, “erat” (it was) of
a relation.  Such are the trifles and subtleties of heretics, who wrest
and bring into question the simple meaning of the commonest words. A
grand question it is, to be sure, <span
id="fr_6389"></span>[6390](#fn_6389) whether “the earth *was*,” which
was made! The real point of discussion is, whether “being without form,
and void,” is a state which is more suitable to that which was created,
or to that of which it was created, so that the predicate (*was*) may
appertain to the same thing to which the subject (*that which was*) also
belongs. <span id="fr_6390"></span>[6391](#fn_6390)
