<p class="c19"><a name="iv.iii.xxix-p2"></A>Let it be made clear, then, first of all, if those to whom sacrifice is offered are really able to protect either emperor or anybody else, and so adjudge us guilty of treason, if angels and demons, spirits of most wicked nature, do any good, if the lost save, if the condemned give liberty, if the dead (I refer to what you know well enough) defend the living. For surely the first thing they would look to would be the protection of their statues, and images, and temples, which rather owe their safety, I think, to the watch kept by C&aelig;sar&#146;s guards. Nay, I think the very materials of which these are made come from C&aelig;sar&#146;s mines, and there is not a temple but depends on C&aelig;sar&#146;s will. Yes, and many gods have felt the displeasure of the C&aelig;sar. It makes for my argument if they are also partakers of his favour, when he bestows on them some gift or privilege. How shall they who are thus in C&aelig;sar&#146;s power, who belong entirely to him, have C&aelig;sar&#146;s protection in their hands, so that you can imagine them able to give to C&aelig;sar what they more readily get from him? This, then, is the ground on which we are charged with treason against the imperial majesty, to wit, that we do not put <A NAME="page_42"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 42</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.xxix-Page_42"></A>the emperors under their own possessions; that we do not offer a mere mock service on their behalf, as not believing their safety rests in leaden hands. But you are impious in a high degree who look for it where it is not, who seek it from those who have it not to give, passing by Him who has it entirely in His power. Besides this, you persecute those who know where to seek for it, and who, knowing where to seek for it, are able as well to secure it.</p>
