<span id="v.vi.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—The Relative Positions of the
Pleroma. The Region of Achamoth, and the Creation of the Demiurge. The
Addition of Fire to the Various Elements and Bodies of Nature.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxiii-p2"></span>Their most eminent powers, moreover,
they confine within the following limits, as in a citadel. In the most
elevated of all summits presides the tricenary Pleroma, <span
id="fr_6835"></span>[6836](#fn_6835) Horos marking off its boundary
line.  Beneath it, Achamoth occupies the intermediate space for her
abode, <span id="fr_6836"></span>[6837](#fn_6836) treading down her son.
For under her comes the Demiurge in his own Hebdomad, or rather the
Devil, *sojourning* in this world in common with ourselves, formed, as
has been said above, of the same elements <span id="page_515">p.
515</span> <span id="v.vi.xxiii-Page_515"></span>and the same body, out
of the most profitable calamities of Sophia; inasmuch as, (if it had not
been for these,) our spirit would have had no space for inhaling and
ejecting <span id="fr_6837"></span>[6838](#fn_6837) air—that delicate
vest of all corporeal creatures, that revealer of all colours, that
instrument of the seasons—if the sadness of Sophia had not filtered it,
just as her fear did the animal existence, and her conversion the
Demiurge himself. Into all these elements and bodies fire was fanned. 
Now, since they have not as yet explained to us the original sensation
of this <span id="fr_6838"></span>[6839](#fn_6838) in Sophia, I will on
my own responsibility <span id="fr_6839"></span>[6840](#fn_6839)
conjecture that its spark was struck out of the delicate emotions <span
id="fr_6840"></span>[6841](#fn_6840) of her (feverish grief). For you
may be quite sure that, amidst all her vexations, she must have had a
good deal of fever. <span id="fr_6841"></span>[6842](#fn_6841)
