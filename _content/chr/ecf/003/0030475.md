<span id="v.v.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—The Shifts to Which Hermogenes is
Reduced, Who Deifies Matter, and Yet is Unwilling to Hold Him Equal with
the Divine Creator.</span>

<span id="v.v.vi-p2"></span>He declares that God’s attribute is still
safe to Him, of being the only God, and the First, and the Author of all
things, and the Lord of all things, and being incomparable to
any—qualities which he straightway ascribes to Matter also. He is God,
to be sure. God shall also attest the same; but He has also sworn
sometimes by Himself, that there is no other God like Him. <span
id="fr_6187"></span>[6188](#fn_6187) Hermogenes, however, will make Him
a liar. For Matter will be such a God as He—being unmade, unborn,
without beginning, and without end. God will say, “I am the
first!” <span id="fr_6188"></span>[6189](#fn_6188) Yet how is He the
first, when Matter is co-eternal with Him? Between co-eternals and
contemporaries there is no sequence of rank. <span
id="fr_6189"></span>[6190](#fn_6189) Is then, Matter also the first?
“I,” says the Lord, “have stretched out the heavens alone.” <span
id="fr_6190"></span>[6191](#fn_6190) But indeed He was not alone, when
that likewise stretched them out, of which He made the expanse. When he
asserts the position that Matter was *eternal*, without any encroachment
on the condition of God, let him see to it that we do not in ridicule
turn the tables on him, that God similarly was eternal without any
encroachment on the condition of Matter—the condition of Both being
still common to Them. The position, therefore, remains unimpugned <span
id="fr_6191"></span>[6192](#fn_6191) both in the case of Matter, that it
did itself exist, only along with God; and that God existed alone, but
with Matter.  It also was first with God, as God, too, was first with
it; it, however, is not comparable with God, as God, too, is not to be
compared with it; with God also it was the Author (of all things), and
with God their Sovereign. In this way *he proposes that God* has
something, and yet not the whole, of Matter. For Him, accordingly,
Hermogenes has reserved nothing which he had not equally conferred on
Matter, so that it is not Matter which is compared with God, but rather
God who is compared with Matter. Now, inasmuch as those qualities which
we claim as peculiar to God—to have always existed, without a beginning,
without an end, and to have been the First, and Alone, and the Author of
all things—are also compatible to Matter, I want to know what property
Matter possesses <span id="page_481">p. 481</span> <span
id="v.v.vi-Page_481"></span>different and alien from God, and hereby
special to itself, by reason of which it is incapable of being compared
with God? That Being, in which occur <span
id="fr_6192"></span>[6193](#fn_6192) all the properties of God, is
sufficiently predetermined without any further comparison.
