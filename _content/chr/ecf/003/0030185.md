<span id="iv.ix.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.ix.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Of the Observance of the
Sabbath.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p2"></span>It follows, accordingly, that, in so far
as the abolition of carnal circumcision and of the old law is
demonstrated as having been consummated at its specific times, so also
the observance of the Sabbath is demonstrated to have been temporary.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p3"></span>For the Jews say, that from the beginning
God sanctified the seventh day, by resting on it from all His works
which He made; and that thence it was, likewise, that Moses said to the
People: “<span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ix.iv-p3.2"></span>Remember</span> the day of the sabbaths, to
sanctify it:  every servile work ye shall not do therein, except what
pertaineth unto life.” <span id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186) Whence
we (Christians) understand that *we* still more ought to observe a
sabbath from all “servile work” <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187) always, and not only every seventh
day, but through all time. And through this arises the question for us,
*what* sabbath God willed us to keep? For the Scriptures point to a
sabbath eternal and a sabbath temporal. For Isaiah the prophet says,
“*Your* sabbaths my soul hateth;” <span
id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188) and in another place he says, “*My*
sabbaths ye have profaned.” <span id="fr_1189"></span>[1190](#fn_1189)
Whence we discern that the temporal sabbath is human, and the eternal
sabbath is accounted divine; concerning which He predicts through
Isaiah: “And there shall be,” He says, “month after month, and day after
day, and sabbath after sabbath; and all flesh shall come to adore in
Jerusalem, saith the Lord;” <span id="fr_1190"></span>[1191](#fn_1190)
which we understand to have been fulfilled in the times of Christ, when
“all flesh”—that is, every nation—“came to adore in Jerusalem” God the
Father, through Jesus Christ His Son, as was predicted through the
prophet: “Behold, proselytes through me shall go unto Thee.” <span
id="fr_1191"></span>[1192](#fn_1191) Thus, therefore, before this
temporal sabbath, there was withal an eternal sabbath foreshown and
foretold; just as before the carnal circumcision there was withal a
spiritual circumcision foreshown. In short, let them teach us, as we
have already premised, that Adam observed the sabbath; or that Abel,
when offering to God a holy victim, pleased Him by a religious reverence
for the sabbath; or that Enoch, when translated, had been a keeper of
the sabbath; or that Noah the ark-builder observed, on account of the
deluge, an immense sabbath; or that Abraham, in observance of the
sabbath, offered Isaac his son; or that Melchizedek in his priesthood
received the law of the sabbath.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p10"></span>But the Jews are sure to say, that ever
since this precept was given through Moses, the observance has been
binding. Manifest accordingly it is, that the precept was not eternal
nor spiritual, but temporary, <span id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192)
which would one day cease. In short, so true is it that it is not in the
exemption from work of the sabbath—that is, of the seventh day—that the
celebration of this solemnity is to consist, that Joshua the son of Nun,
at the time that he was reducing the city Jericho by war, stated that he
had received from God a precept to order the People that priests should
carry the ark of the testament of God seven days, making the circuit of
the city; and thus, when the seventh day’s circuit had been performed,
the walls of the city would spontaneously fall. <span
id="fr_1193"></span>[1194](#fn_1193) Which was so done; and when the
space of the seventh day was finished, just as was predicted, down fell
the walls of the city. Whence it is manifestly shown, that in the number
of the seven days there intervened a sabbath-day. For seven days,
whencesoever they may have commenced, must necessarily include within
them a sabbath-day; on which day not only must the priests have worked,
but the city must have been made a prey by the edge of the sword by all
the people of Israel. Nor is it doubtful that they “wrought servile
work,” <span id="page_156">p. 156</span> <span
id="iv.ix.iv-Page_156"></span>when, in obedience to God’s precept, they
drave the preys of war. For in the times of the Maccabees, too, they did
bravely in fighting on the sabbaths, and routed their foreign foes, and
recalled the law of their fathers to the primitive style of life by
fighting on the sabbaths. <span id="fr_1194"></span>[1195](#fn_1194) Nor
should I think it was any other law which they thus vindicated, than the
one in which they remembered the existence of the prescript touching
“the day of the sabbaths.” <span id="fr_1195"></span>[1196](#fn_1195)

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p15"></span>Whence it is manifest that the force of
such precepts was temporary, and respected the necessity of present
circumstances; and that it was not with a view to its observance in
perpetuity that God formerly gave them such a law.
