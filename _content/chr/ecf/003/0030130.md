<span id="iv.vi.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.vi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.xv-p2"></span>Keep for God His own property untainted;
He will crown it if He choose. Nay, then, He does even choose. He calls
us to it. To him who conquers He says, “I will give a crown of
life.” <span id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440) Be *you*, too, faithful
unto <span id="page_103">p. 103</span> <span
id="iv.vi.xv-Page_103"></span>death, and fight *you*, too, the good
fight, whose crown the apostle <span id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441)
feels so justly confident has been laid up for him. The angel <span
id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442) also, as he goes forth on a white
horse, conquering and to conquer, receives a crown of victory; and
another <span id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443) is adorned with an
encircling rainbow (as it were in its fair colours)—a celestial meadow.
In like manner, the elders sit crowned around, crowned too with a crown
of gold, and the Son of Man Himself flashes out above the clouds. If
such are the appearances in the vision of the seer, of what sort will be
the realities in the actual manifestation?  Look at those crowns. Inhale
those odours. Why condemn you to a little chaplet, or a twisted
headband, the brow which has been destined for a diadem? For Christ
Jesus has made us even kings to God and His Father. What have you in
common with the flower which is to die? You have a flower in the Branch
of Jesse, upon which the grace of the Divine Spirit in all its fulness
rested—a flower undefiled, unfading, everlasting, by choosing which the
good soldier, too, has got promotion in the heavenly ranks.  Blush, ye
fellow-soldiers of his, henceforth not to be condemned even by him, but
by some soldier of Mithras, who, at his initiation in the gloomy cavern,
in the camp, it may well be said, of darkness, when at the sword’s point
a crown is presented to him, as though in mimicry of martyrdom, and
thereupon put upon his head, is admonished to resist and cast it off,
and, if you like, transfer it to his shoulder, saying that Mithras is
his crown. And thenceforth he is never crowned; and he has that for a
mark to show who he is, if anywhere he be subjected to trial in respect
of his religion; and he is at once believed to be a soldier of Mithras
if he throws the crown away—if he say that in his god he has his crown.
Let us take note of the devices of the devil, who is wont to ape some of
God’s things with no other design than, by the faithfulness of his
servants, to put us to shame, and to condemn us.
