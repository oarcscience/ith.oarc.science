<span id="v.viii.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.—Additional Evidence
Afforded to Us in the Acts of the Apostles.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xxxix-p2"></span>The Acts of the Apostles, too,
attest <span id="fr_7534"></span>[7535](#fn_7534) the resurrection. Now
the apostles had nothing else to do, at least among the Jews, than to
explain <span id="fr_7535"></span>[7536](#fn_7535) the Old Testament and
confirm <span id="fr_7536"></span>[7537](#fn_7536) the New, and above
all, to preach God in Christ. Consequently they introduced nothing new
concerning the resurrection, besides announcing it to the glory of
Christ: in every other respect it had been already received in simple
and intelligent faith, without any question as to what sort of
resurrection it was to be, and without encountering any other opponents
than the Sadducees. So much easier was it to deny the resurrection
altogether, than to understand it in an alien sense. You find Paul
confessing his faith before the chief priests, under the shelter of the
chief captain, <span id="fr_7537"></span>[7538](#fn_7537) among the
Sadducees and the Pharisees:  “Men and brethren,” he says, “I am a
Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; of the hope and resurrection of the
dead I am now called in question by you,” <span
id="fr_7538"></span>[7539](#fn_7538) —referring, of course, to the
nation’s hope; in order to avoid, in his present condition, as an
apparent transgressor of the law, being thought to approach to the
Sadducees in opinion on the most important article of the faith—even the
resurrection. That belief, therefore, in the resurrection which he would
not appear to impair, he really confirmed in the opinion of the
Pharisees, since he rejected the views of the Sadducees, who denied it.
In like manner, before Agrippa also, he says that he was advancing “none
other things than those which the prophets had announced.” <span
id="fr_7539"></span>[7540](#fn_7539) He was therefore maintaining just
such a resurrection as the prophets had foretold.  He mentions also what
is written by “Moses,” touching the resurrection of the dead; (and in so
doing) he must have known that it would be a rising in the body, since
requisition will have to be made therein of the blood of man. <span
id="fr_7540"></span>[7541](#fn_7540) He declared it then to be of such a
character as the Pharisees had admitted it, and such as the Lord had
Himself maintained it, and such too as the Sadducees refused to believe
it—such refusal leading them indeed to an absolute rejection of the
whole verity. Nor had the Athenians previously understood Paul to
announce any other resurrection. <span
id="fr_7541"></span>[7542](#fn_7541) They had, in fact, derided his
announcement; but they would have indulged no such derision if they had
heard from him nothing but the restoration of the soul, for they would
have received *that* as the very common anticipation of their own native
philosophy. But when the preaching of the resurrection, of which they
had previously not heard, by its absolute novelty excited the heathen,
and a not unnatural incredulity in so wonderful a matter began to harass
the simple faith with many discussions, then the apostle took care in
almost every one of his writings to strengthen men’s belief of <span
id="page_574">p. 574</span> <span id="v.viii.xxxix-Page_574"></span>this
*Christian* hope, pointing out that there was such a hope, and that it
had not as yet been realized, and that it would be in the body,—a point
which was the especial object of inquiry, and, what was besides a
doubtful question, not in a body of a different kind from ours.
