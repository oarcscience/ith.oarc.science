<p class="c30"><a name="iv.iv.v-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="iv.iv.v-p1.1"></A>Chapter V.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_184"><FONT SIZE="1">185</FONT></A>
&#8212;Sundry Objections or Excuses Dealt with.</span></p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="iv.iv.v-p3"></A>We will certainly take more pains in answering the excuses of artificers of this kind, who ought never to be admitted into the house of God, if any have a knowledge of that Discipline.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">186</FONT></A>
 To begin with, that speech, wont to be cast in our teeth, &#8220;I have nothing else whereby to live,&#8221; may be more severely retorted, &#8220;You have, then, whereby to live?&#160; If by your own laws, what have you to do with God?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">187</FONT></A>
 Then, as to the argument they have the hardihood to bring even from the Scriptures, &#8220;that the apostle has said, &#145;As each has been found, so let him persevere.&#146;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_187"><FONT SIZE="1">188</FONT></A>
 We may all, therefore, persevere in <i>sins</i>, as the result of <i>that</i> interpretation! for there is not any one of us who has not been found as a <i>sinner</i>, since no other cause was the source of Christ&#146;s descent than that of setting <i>sinners</i> free. Again, they say the same apostle has left a precept, according to his own example, &#8220;That each one work with his own hands for a living.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_188"></A><A HREF="#fn_188"><FONT SIZE="1">189</FONT></A>
 If this precept is maintained in respect to <i>all</i> hands, I believe even the bath-thieves&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_189"></A><A HREF="#fn_189"><FONT SIZE="1">190</FONT></A>
 live by their hands, and robbers themselves gain the means to live by their hands; forgers, again, execute their evil handwritings, not of course with their feet, but hands; actors, however, achieve a livelihood not with hands alone, but with their entire limbs. Let the Church, therefore, stand open to <i>all</i> who are supported by their hands and by their own work; if there is no exception of arts which the Discipline of God receives not. But some one says, in opposition to our proposition of &#8220;similitude being interdicted,&#8221; &#8220;Why, then, did Moses in the desert make a likeness of a serpent out of bronze?&#8221; The figures, which used to be laid as a groundwork for some secret future dispensation, not with a view to the repeal of the law, but as a type of their own final cause, stand in a class by themselves. Otherwise, if we should interpret these things as the adversaries of the law do, do we, too, as the Marcionites do, ascribe inconsistency to the Almighty, whom <i>they</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">191</FONT></A>
 in this manner destroy as being mutable, while in one place He forbids, in another commands? But if any feigns ignorance of the fact that that effigy of the serpent of bronze, after the manner of one uphung, denoted the shape of the Lord&#146;s cross,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">192</FONT></A>
 which <A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iv.v-Page_64"></A>was to free us from serpents&#8212;that is, from the devil&#146;s angels&#8212;while, through itself, it hanged up the devil slain; or whatever other exposition of that figure has been revealed to worthier men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">193</FONT></A>
 no matter, provided we remember the apostle affirms that all things happened at that time to the People&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="#fn_193"><FONT SIZE="1">194</FONT></A>
 <i>figuratively</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_194"></A><A HREF="#fn_194"><FONT SIZE="1">195</FONT></A>
 It is enough that the same God, as by law He forbade the making of similitude, did, by the extraordinary precept in the case of the serpent, interdict similitude.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_195"></A><A HREF="#fn_195"><FONT SIZE="1">196</FONT></A>
 If you reverence the same God, you have His law, &#8220;Thou shalt make no similitude.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_196"></A><A HREF="#fn_196"><FONT SIZE="1">197</FONT></A>
 If you look back, too, to the precept enjoining the subsequently made similitude, do you, too, imitate Moses: make not any likeness in opposition to the law, unless to <i>you</i>, too, God have bidden it.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_197"></A><A HREF="#fn_197"><FONT SIZE="1">198</FONT></A>
