<p class="c19"><a name="vi.ii.xi-p2"></A>What if, besides the shame which they make the most account of, <i>men</i> dread likewise the bodily inconveniences; in that, unwashen, sordidly attired, estranged from gladness, they must spend their time in the roughness of sackcloth, and the horridness of ashes, and the sunkenness of face caused by fasting? Is it then becoming for us to supplicate for our sins in scarlet and purple?&#160; Hasten hither with the pin for panning the hair, and the powder for polishing the teeth, and some forked implement of steel or brass for cleaning the nails. Whatever of false brilliance, whatever of feigned redness, <i>is to be had</i>, let him diligently apply it to his lips or cheeks. Let him furthermore seek out baths of more genial temperature in some gardened or seaside retreat; let him enlarge his expenses; let him carefully seek the rarest delicacy of fatted fowls; let him refine his old wine: and when any shall ask him, &#8220;On whom are you lavishing all this?&#8221; let him say, &#8220;I have sinned against God, and am in peril of eternally perishing: and so now I am drooping, and wasting and torturing myself, that I may reconcile God to myself, whom by sinning I have offended.&#8221; Why, they who go about canvassing for the obtaining of civil office, feel it neither degrading nor irksome to struggle, in behalf of such their desires, with annoyances to soul and body; and not annoyances merely, but likewise contumelies of all kinds. What meannesses of dress do they not affect? what houses do they not beset with early and late visits?&#8212;bowing whenever they meet any high personage, frequenting no banquets, associating in no entertainments, but voluntarily exiled from the felicity of freedom and festivity: and all that for the sake of the fleeting joy of a single year! Do <i>we</i> hesitate, when eternity is at stake, to endure what the competitor for consulship or pr&aelig;torship puts up with?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8521"></A><A HREF="#fn_8521"><FONT SIZE="1">8522</FONT></A>
 and shall we be tardy in offering to the offended Lord a self-chastisement in food and raiment, which&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8522"></A><A HREF="#fn_8522"><FONT SIZE="1">8523</FONT></A>
 Gentiles lay upon themselves when they have offended no one at all? Such are they of whom Scripture makes mention: &#8220;Woe to them who bind their own sins as it were with a long rope.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8523"></A><A HREF="#fn_8523"><FONT SIZE="1">8524</FONT></A>
