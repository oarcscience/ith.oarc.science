<span id="v.iv.ii.ix-p1"></span> <span id="page_277">p. 277</span> <span
id="v.iv.ii.ix-Page_277"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Marcion’s Gnostic Pretensions
Vain, for the True God is Neither Unknown Nor Uncertain.  The Creator,
Whom He Owns to Be God, Alone Supplies an Induction, by Which to Judge
of the True God.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.ix-p2"></span>Now I know full well by what perceptive
faculty they boast of their new god; even their knowledge. <span
id="fr_2419"></span>[2420](#fn_2419) It is, however, this very discovery
of a novel thing—so striking to common minds—as well as the natural
gratification which is inherent in novelty, that I wanted to refute, and
thence further to challenge a proof of this unknown god.  For him whom
by their knowledge <span id="fr_2420"></span>[2421](#fn_2420) they
present to us as new, they prove to have been unknown previous to that
knowledge. Let us keep within the strict limits and measure of our
argument.  Convince me there could have been an unknown god. I find, no
doubt, <span id="fr_2421"></span>[2422](#fn_2421) that altars have been
lavished on unknown gods; that, however, is the idolatry of Athens. And
on uncertain gods; but that, too, is only Roman superstition. 
Furthermore, uncertain gods are not well known, because no certainty
about them exists; and because of this uncertainty they are therefore
unknown. Now, which of these two titles shall we carve for Marcion’s
god? Both, I suppose, as for a being who is still *uncertain*, and was
formerly *unknown*. For inasmuch as the Creator, being a known God,
caused him to be unknown; so, as being a certain God, he made him to be
uncertain. But I will not go so far out of my way, as to say: <span
id="fr_2422"></span>[2423](#fn_2422) If God was unknown and concealed,
He was overshadowed in such a region of darkness, as must have been
itself new and unknown, and be even now likewise uncertain—some immense
region indeed, one undoubtedly greater than the God whom it concealed.
But I will briefly state my subject, and afterwards most fully pursue
it, promising that God neither could have been, nor ought to have been,
unknown. *Could* not have been, because of His greatness; *ought* not to
have been, because of His goodness, especially as He is (supposed, by
Marcion) more excellent in both these attributes than our Creator.
Since, however, I observe that in some points the proof of every new and
heretofore unknown god ought, for its test, <span
id="fr_2423"></span>[2424](#fn_2423) to be compared to the form of the
Creator, it will be my duty <span id="fr_2424"></span>[2425](#fn_2424)
first of all to show that this very course is adopted by me in a settled
plan, <span id="fr_2425"></span>[2426](#fn_2425) such as I might with
greater confidence <span id="fr_2426"></span>[2427](#fn_2426) use in
support of my argument. Before every other consideration, (let me ask)
how it happens that you, <span id="fr_2427"></span>[2428](#fn_2427) who
acknowledge <span id="fr_2428"></span>[2429](#fn_2428) the Creator to be
God, and from your knowledge confess Him to be prior in existence, do
not know that the other *god* should be examined by you in exactly the
same course of investigation which has taught you how to find out a god
in the first case? Every prior thing has furnished the rule for the
latter. In the present question two gods are propounded, the unknown and
the known.  Concerning the known there is no <span
id="fr_2429"></span>[2430](#fn_2429) question. It is plain that He
exists, else He would not be known. The dispute is concerning the
unknown god. Possibly he has no existence; because, if he had, he would
have been known. Now that which, so long as it is unknown, is an object
to be questioned, is an uncertainty so long as it remains thus
questionable; and all the while it is in this state of uncertainty, it
possibly has no existence at all. You have a god who is so far certain,
as he is known; and uncertain, as unknown. This being the case, does it
appear to you to be justly defensible, that uncertainties should be
submitted for proof to the rule, and form, and standard of certainties? 
Now, if to the subject before us, which is in itself full of uncertainty
thus far, there be applied also arguments <span
id="fr_2430"></span>[2431](#fn_2430) derived from uncertainties, we
shall be involved in such a series of questions arising out of our
treatment of these same uncertain arguments, as shall by reason of their
uncertainty be dangerous to the faith, and we shall drift into those
insoluble questions which the apostle has no affection for. If,
again, <span id="fr_2431"></span>[2432](#fn_2431) in things wherein
there is found a diversity of condition, they shall prejudge, as no
doubt they will, <span id="fr_2432"></span>[2433](#fn_2432) uncertain,
doubtful, and intricate points, by the certain, undoubted, and clear
sides <span id="fr_2433"></span>[2434](#fn_2433) of their rule, it will
probably happen that <span id="fr_2434"></span>[2435](#fn_2434) (those
points) will not be submitted to the standard of certainties for
determination, as being freed by the diversity of their essential
condition <span id="fr_2435"></span>[2436](#fn_2435) from the
application of such a standard in all other respects. As, therefore, it
is two gods which are the subject of our proposition, their essential
condition must be the same in both. For, as concerns their divinity,
they are both unbegotten, unmade, eternal. This will be their essential
condition. All other points Marcion <span id="page_278">p. 278</span>
<span id="v.iv.ii.ix-Page_278"></span>himself seems to have made light
of, <span id="fr_2436"></span>[2437](#fn_2436) for he has placed them in
a different <span id="fr_2437"></span>[2438](#fn_2437) category. They
are subsequent in the order of treatment; indeed, they will not have to
be brought into the discussion, <span
id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438) since on the essential condition
there is no dispute. Now there is this absence of our dispute, because
they are both of them gods.  Those things, therefore, whose community of
condition is evident, will, when brought to a test on the ground of that
common condition, <span id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439) have to be
submitted, although they are uncertain, to the standard <span
id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440) of those certainties with which
they are classed in the community of their essential condition, so as on
this account to share also in their manner of proof. I shall therefore
contend <span id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441) with the greatest
confidence that he is not God who is to-day uncertain, because he has
been hitherto unknown; for of whomsoever it is evident that he is God,
from this very fact it is (equally) evident, that he never has been
unknown, and therefore never uncertain.
