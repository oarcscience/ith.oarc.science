id="vi.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Of Sitting After Prayer.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi-p2"></span>Again, for the custom which some have of
sitting when prayer is ended, I perceive no reason, except that which
children give. <span id="fr_8856"></span>[8857](#fn_8856) For what if
that Hermas, <span id="fr_8857"></span>[8858](#fn_8857) whose writing is
generally inscribed with the title *The Shepherd*, had, after finishing
his prayer, not sat down on his bed, but done some other thing: should
we maintain that also as a matter for observance? Of course not. Why,
even as it is the sentence, “When I had prayed, and had sat down on my
bed,” is simply put with a view to the order of the narration, not as a
model of discipline.  Else we shall have to pray nowhere except where
there is a bed! Nay, whoever sits in a *chair* or on a *bench*, will act
contrary to that writing.  Further: inasmuch as the nations do the like,
in sitting down after adoring their petty images; even on this account
the practice deserves to be censured in us, because it is observed in
the worship of idols. To this is further added the charge of
*irreverence*,—intelligible even to the nations themselves, if they had
any sense. If, on the one hand, it is irreverent to sit under the eye,
and over against the eye, of him whom you most of all revere and
venerate; how much more, on the other hand, is that deed *most*
irreligious under the eye of the living God, while the angel of prayer
is still *standing by* <span id="fr_8858"></span>[8859](#fn_8858) unless
we are upbraiding God that prayer has wearied us!

us to [Tob. xii. 12](../../../bib/apo/tob012.htm#012)<span
