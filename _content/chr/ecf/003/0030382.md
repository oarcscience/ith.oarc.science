<span id="v.iv.iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Absurdity of Marcion’s
Docetic Opinions; Reality of Christ’s Incarnation.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.viii-p2"></span>Our heretic must now cease to borrow
poison from the Jew—“the asp,” as the adage runs, “from the viper” <span
id="fr_3207"></span>[3208](#fn_3207) —and henceforth vomit forth the
virulence of his own disposition, as when he alleges Christ to be a
phantom. Except, indeed, that this opinion of his will be sure to have
others to maintain it in his precocious and somewhat abortive
Marcionites, whom the Apostle John designated as antichrists, when they
denied that Christ was come in the flesh; not that they did this with
the view of establishing the right of the other god (for on this point
also they had been branded by the same apostle), but because they had
started with assuming the incredibility of an incarnate God. Now, the
more firmly the antichrist Marcion had seized this assumption, the more
prepared was he, of course, to reject the bodily substance of Christ,
since he had introduced his very god to our notice as neither the author
nor the restorer of the flesh; and for this very reason, to be sure, as
pre-eminently good, and most remote from the deceits and fallacies of
the Creator. His Christ, therefore, in order to avoid all such deceits
and fallacies, and the imputation, if possible, of belonging to the
Creator, was not what he appeared to be, and feigned himself to be what
he was not—incarnate without being flesh, human without being man, and
likewise a divine Christ without being God! But why should he not have
propagated also the phantom of God? Can I believe him on the subject of
the internal nature, who was all wrong touching the external substance?
How will it be possible to believe him true on a mystery, when he has
been found so false on a plain fact? How, <span id="page_328">p.
328</span> <span id="v.iv.iv.viii-Page_328"></span>moreover, when he
confounds the truth of the spirit with the error of the flesh, <span
id="fr_3208"></span>[3209](#fn_3208) could he combine within himself
that communion of light and darkness, or truth and error, which the
apostle says cannot co-exist? <span id="fr_3209"></span>[3210](#fn_3209)
Since however, Christ’s being flesh is now discovered to be a lie, it
follows that all things which were done by the flesh of Christ were done
untruly, <span id="fr_3210"></span>[3211](#fn_3210) —every act of
intercourse, <span id="fr_3211"></span>[3212](#fn_3211) of contact, of
eating or drinking, <span id="fr_3212"></span>[3213](#fn_3212) yea, His
very miracles. If with a touch, or by being touched, He freed any one of
a disease, whatever was done by any corporeal act cannot be believed to
have been truly done in the absence of all reality in His body itself.
Nothing substantial can be allowed to have been effected by an
unsubstantial thing; nothing full by a vacuity. If the habit were
putative, the action was putative; if the worker were imaginary, the
works were imaginary. On this principle, too, the sufferings of Christ
will be found not to warrant faith in Him. For He suffered nothing who
did not truly suffer; and a phantom could not truly suffer.  God’s
entire work, therefore, is subverted. Christ’s death, wherein lies the
whole weight and fruit of the Christian name, is denied although the
apostle asserts <span id="fr_3213"></span>[3214](#fn_3213) it so
expressly <span id="fr_3214"></span>[3215](#fn_3214) as undoubtedly
real, making it the very foundation of the gospel, of our salvation and
of his own preaching. <span id="fr_3215"></span>[3216](#fn_3215) “I have
delivered unto you before all things,” says he, “how that Christ died
for our sins, and that he was buried, and that He rose again the third
day.”  Besides, if His flesh is denied, how is His death to be asserted;
for death is the proper suffering of the flesh, which returns through
death back to the earth out of which it was taken, according to the law
of its Maker? Now, if His death be denied, because of the denial of His
flesh, there will be no certainty of His resurrection. For He rose not,
for the very same reason that He died not, even because He possessed not
the reality of the flesh, to which as death accrues, so does
resurrection likewise. Similarly, if Christ’s resurrection be nullified,
ours also is destroyed. If Christ’s *resurrection* be not
realized, <span id="fr_3216"></span>[3217](#fn_3216) neither shall that
be for which Christ came.  For just as they, who said that there is no
resurrection of the dead, are refuted by the apostle from the
resurrection of Christ, so, if the resurrection of Christ falls to the
ground, the resurrection of the dead is also swept away. <span
id="fr_3217"></span>[3218](#fn_3217) And so our faith is vain, and vain
also is the preaching of the apostles. Moreover, they even show
themselves to be false witnesses of God, because they testified that He
raised up Christ, whom He did not raise. And we remain in our sins
still. <span id="fr_3218"></span>[3219](#fn_3218) And those who have
slept in Christ have perished; destined, forsooth, <span
id="fr_3219"></span>[3220](#fn_3219) to rise again, but peradventure in
a phantom state, <span id="fr_3220"></span>[3221](#fn_3220) just like
Christ.
