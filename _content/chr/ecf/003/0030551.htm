<p class="c19"><a name="v.vi.xxxvi-p2"></A>How much more sensible are they who, rejecting all this tiresome nonsense, have refused to believe that any one &AElig;on has descended from another by steps like these, which are really neither more nor less <i>Gemonian</i>;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6919"></A><A HREF="#fn_6919"><FONT SIZE="1">6920</FONT></A>
 but that on a given signal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6920"></A><A HREF="#fn_6920"><FONT SIZE="1">6921</FONT></A>
 the eight-fold emanation, of which we have heard,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6921"></A><A HREF="#fn_6921"><FONT SIZE="1">6922</FONT></A>
 issued all at once from the Father and His Enn&#339;a (<i>Thought</i>),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6922"></A><A HREF="#fn_6922"><FONT SIZE="1">6923</FONT></A>
&#8212;that it is, in fact, from His mere motion that they gain their designations. When, as they say, He thought of producing offspring, He on that account gained the name of <span class="sc"><a name="v.vi.xxxvi-p6.1"></A>Father</span>. After producing, because the issue which He produced was true, He received the name of <i>Truth</i>. When He wanted Himself to be manifested, He on that account was announced as <i>Man</i>. Those, moreover, whom He preconceived in His thought when He produced them, were then designated <i>the Church</i>. As man, He uttered <A NAME="page_520"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 520</FONT></A> <a name="v.vi.xxxvi-Page_520"></A>His <i>Word</i>; and so this <i>Word</i> is His first-begotten Son, and to the Word was added <i>Life</i>. And by this process the first Ogdoad was completed. However, the whole of this tiresome story is utterly poor and weak.</p>
