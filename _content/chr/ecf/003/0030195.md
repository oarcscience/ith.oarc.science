<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.ix.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Conclusion. Clue to the Error of
the Jews.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p2"></span>Learn now (over and above the immediate
question) the clue to your error.  We affirm, *two* characters of the
Christ demonstrated by the prophets, and as many *advents* of His
forenoted:  one, in humility (of course the first), when He has to be
led “as a sheep for a victim; and, as a lamb voiceless before the
shearer, so He opened not His mouth,” not even in His aspect comely. 
For “we have announced,” says *the prophet*, “concerning Him, (He is) as
a little child, as a root in a thirsty land; and there was not in Him
attractiveness or glory. And we saw Him, and He had not attractiveness
or grace; but His mien was unhonoured, deficient in comparison of the
sons of men,” <span id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444) “a man *set* in
the plague, <span id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445) and knowing how
to bear infirmity:” to wit as having been set by the Father “for a stone
of offence,” <span id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446) and “made a
little lower” by Him “than angels,” <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447) He pronounces Himself “a worm, and
not a man, an ignominy of man, and *the* refuse of *the* People.” <span
id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448) Which evidences of ignobility suit
the <span class="sc"><span id="iv.ix.xiv-p7.4"></span>First
Advent</span>, just as those of sublimity do the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ix.xiv-p7.5"></span>Second</span>; when He shall be made no
longer “a stone of offence nor a rock of scandal,” but “the highest
corner-stone,” <span id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449) after
reprobation (on earth) taken up (into heaven) and raised sublime for the
purpose of consummation, <span id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450) and
that “rock”—so we must admit—which is read of in Daniel as forecut from
a mount, which shall crush and crumble the image of secular
kingdoms. <span id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451) Of which second
advent of the same (Christ) Daniel has said: “And, behold, as it were a
Son of man, coming with the clouds of the heaven, came unto the Ancient
of days, and was present in His sight; and they who were standing by led
(Him) unto Him. And there was given Him royal power; and all nations of
the earth, according to their race, and all glory, shall serve Him: and
His power *is* eternal, which shall not be taken away, and His kingdom
*one* which shall not be corrupted.” <span
id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452) Then, assuredly, is He to have an
honourable mien, and a grace not “deficient more than the sons of men;”
for (He will then be) “blooming in beauty in comparison with the sons of
men.” <span id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453) “Grace,” says *the
Psalmist*, “hath been outpoured in Thy lips: wherefore God hath blessed
Thee unto eternity. Gird Thee Thy sword around Thy thigh, most potent in
Thy bloom and beauty!” <span id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454) while
the Father withal afterwards, after making Him somewhat lower than
angels, “crowned Him with glory and honour and subjected all *things*
beneath His feet.” <span id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455) And then
shall they “learn to know Him whom they pierced, and shall beat their
breasts tribe by tribe;” <span id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456) of
course because in days bygone they did *not* know Him when conditioned
in the humility of human estate. Jeremiah says: “He is a human being,
and who will learn to know Him?” <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457) because, “His nativity,” says
Isaiah, “who shall declare?” So, too, in Zechariah, in His own person,
nay, in the very mystery <span id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458) of
His name withal, the most true Priest of the Father, His own <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459) Christ, is delineated in a twofold
garb with reference to the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ix.xiv-p18.1"></span>two advents</span>. <span
id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460) First, He was clad in “sordid
attire,” that is, in the indignity of passible and mortal flesh, when
the devil, withal, was opposing himself to Him—the instigator, to wit,
of Judas the traitor <span id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461) —who
even after His baptism had tempted Him.  In the next place, He was
stripped of His former sordid raiment, and adorned with a garment down
to the foot, and with a turban and a clean mitre, that is, (with the
garb) of the <span class="sc"><span id="iv.ix.xiv-p20.3"></span>second
advent</span>; since He is demonstrated as having attained “glory and
honour.” Nor <span id="page_173">p. 173</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_173"></span>will you be able to say that the man
(there depicted) is “the son of Jozadak,” <span
id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462) who was never at all clad in a
sordid garment, but was always adorned with the sacerdotal garment, nor
ever deprived of the sacerdotal function. But the “Jesus” <span
id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463) there alluded to is <span
class="sc"><span id="iv.ix.xiv-p22.1"></span>Christ</span>, the Priest
of God the most high Father; who at His <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ix.xiv-p22.2"></span>first advent</span> came in humility, in
human form, and passible, even up to the period of His passion; being
Himself likewise made, through all (stages of suffering) a victim for us
all; who after His resurrection was “clad with a garment down to the
foot,” <span id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464) and named the Priest
of God the Father unto eternity. <span
id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465) So, again, I will make an
interpretation of the two goats which were habitually offered on the
fast-day. <span id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466) Do not they, too,
point to each successive stage in the character of the Christ who is
already come? A pair, on the one hand, and consimilar (they were),
because of the identity of the Lord’s general appearance, inasmuch as He
is not to come in some other form, seeing that He has to be recognised
by those by whom He was once hurt. But the one of them, begirt with
scarlet, amid cursing and universal spitting, and tearing, and piercing,
was cast away by the People outside the city into perdition, marked with
manifest tokens of Christ’s passion; who, after being begirt with
scarlet garment, and subjected to universal spitting, and afflicted with
all contumelies, was crucified outside the city. <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467) The other, however, offered for
sins, and given as food *to the priests merely* of the temple, <span
id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468) gave signal evidences of the second
appearance; in so far as, after the expiation of all sins, the priests
of the spiritual temple, that is, of the church, were to enjoy <span
id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469) a spiritual public distribution (as
it were) of the Lord’s grace, while all others are fasting from
salvation.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p29"></span>Therefore, since the vaticinations of
the <span class="sc"><span id="iv.ix.xiv-p29.2"></span>first
advent</span> obscured it with manifold figures, and debased it with
every dishonour, while the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ix.xiv-p29.3"></span>second</span> (was foretold as) manifest and
wholly worthy of God, it has resulted therefrom, that, by fixing their
gaze on that one alone which they could easily understand and believe
(that is, the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ix.xiv-p29.4"></span>second</span>, which is in honour and
glory), they have been (not undeservedly) deceived as to the more
obscure—at all events, the more unworthy—that is, the <span
class="sc"><span id="iv.ix.xiv-p29.5"></span>first</span>. And thus to
the present moment they affirm that their Christ is not come, because He
is not come in majesty; while they are ignorant of <span
id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470) the fact that He was first to come
in humility.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p31"></span>Enough it is, meantime, to have thus far
followed the stream downward of the order of Christ’s course, whereby He
is proved such as He was habitually announced: in order that, as a
result of this harmony of the Divine Scriptures, we may understand; and
that the events which used to be predicted as destined to take place
after Christ may be believed to have been accomplished as the result of
a divine arrangement. For unless He come *after* whom they had to be
accomplished, by no means would the events, the future occurrence
whereof was predictively assigned to His advent, have come to pass. 
Therefore, if you see universal nations thenceforth emerging from the
profundity of human error to God the Creator and His Christ (which you
dare not assert to have not been prophesied, because, albeit you were so
to assert, there would forthwith—as we have already premised <span
id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471) —occur to you the promise of the
Father saying, “My Son art Thou; I this day have begotten Thee; ask of
Me, and I will give Thee Gentiles *as* Thine heritage, and *as* Thy
possession the boundaries of the earth.”  Nor will you be able to
vindicate, as the subject of that prediction, rather the son of David,
Solomon, than Christ, God’s Son; nor “the boundaries of the earth,” as
promised rather to David’s son, who reigned within the single land of
Judea, than to Christ the Son of God, who has already illumined the
whole world <span id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472) with the rays of
His gospel. In short, again, a throne “unto the age” <span
id="fr_1473"></span>[1474](#fn_1473) is more suitable to Christ, God’s
Son, than to Solomon,—a temporal king, to wit, who reigned over Israel
alone. For at the present day nations are invoking Christ which used not
to know Him; and peoples at the present day are fleeing in a body to the
Christ of whom in days bygone they were ignorant <span
id="fr_1474"></span>[1475](#fn_1474) ), you cannot contend that is
future which you see taking place. <span
id="fr_1475"></span>[1476](#fn_1475) Either deny that these events were
prophesied, while they are seen before your eyes; or else have been
fulfilled, while you hear them read: or, on the other hand, if you fail
to deny each position, they will have their fulfilment in Him with
respect to whom they were prophesied.

Christus Ipsius,” as in the text.  But Rig., whose judgment is generally
very sound, prefers, with some others, to read, “verus summus sacerdos
Patris Christus Jesus;” which agrees better with the previous allusion
to “the mystery of His name withal:” comp. c. ix. above, towards the
end.
