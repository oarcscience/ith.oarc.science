<span id="v.iv.iv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Figurative Style of Certain
Messianic Prophecies in the Psalms. Military Metaphors Applied to
Christ.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.xiv-p2"></span>This interpretation of ours will derive
confirmation, when, on your supposing that Christ is in any passage
called a warrior, from the mention of certain arms and expressions of
that sort, you weigh well the analogy of their other meanings, and draw
your conclusions accordingly. “Gird on Thy sword,” says David, “upon Thy
thigh.” <span id="fr_3285"></span>[3286](#fn_3285) But what do you read
about Christ just before? “Thou art fairer <span id="page_333">p.
333</span> <span id="v.iv.iv.xiv-Page_333"></span>than the children of
men; grace is poured forth upon Thy lips.” <span
id="fr_3286"></span>[3287](#fn_3286) It amuses me to imagine that
blandishments of fair beauty and graceful lips are ascribed to one who
had to gird on His sword for war! So likewise, when it is added, “Ride
on prosperously in Thy majesty,” <span
id="fr_3287"></span>[3288](#fn_3287) the reason is subjoined: “Because
of truth, and meekness, and righteousness.” <span
id="fr_3288"></span>[3289](#fn_3288) But who shall produce *these*
results with the sword, and not their opposites rather—deceit, and
harshness, and injury—which, it must be confessed, are the proper
business of battles? Let us see, therefore, whether that is not some
other sword, which has so different an action. Now the Apostle John, in
the Apocalypse, describes a sword which proceeded from the mouth of God
as “a doubly sharp, two-edged one.” <span
id="fr_3289"></span>[3290](#fn_3289) This may be understood to be the
Divine Word, who is doubly edged with the two testaments of the law and
the gospel—sharpened with wisdom, hostile to the devil, arming us
against the spiritual enemies of all wickedness and concupiscence, and
cutting us off from the dearest objects for the sake of God’s holy name.
If, however, you will not acknowledge John, you have our common master
Paul, who “girds our loins about with truth, and puts on us the
breastplate of righteousness, and shoes us with the preparation of the
gospel of peace, not of war; who bids us take the shield of faith,
wherewith we may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the devil, and
the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which (he says) is
the word of God.” <span id="fr_3290"></span>[3291](#fn_3290) This sword
the Lord Himself came to send on earth, and not peace. <span
id="fr_3291"></span>[3292](#fn_3291) If he is your Christ, then even he
is a warrior. If he is not a warrior, and the sword he brandishes is an
allegorical one, then the Creator’s Christ in the psalm too may have
been girded with the figurative sword of the Word, without any martial
gear. The above-mentioned “fairness” of His beauty and “grace of His
lips” would quite suit such a sword, girt as it even then was upon His
thigh in the passage of David, and sent as it would one day be by Him on
earth. For this is what He says: “Ride on prosperously in Thy
majesty <span id="fr_3292"></span>[3293](#fn_3292) ”—*advancing* His
word into every land, so as to call all nations: destined to *prosper*
in the success of that faith which received Him, and *reigning*, from
the fact that <span id="fr_3293"></span>[3294](#fn_3293) He conquered
death by His resurrection.  “Thy right hand,” says He, “shall
wonderfully lead Thee forth,” <span id="fr_3294"></span>[3295](#fn_3294)
even the might of Thy spiritual grace, whereby the knowledge of Christ
is spread. “Thine arrows are sharp;” <span
id="fr_3295"></span>[3296](#fn_3295) everywhere Thy precepts fly about,
Thy threatenings also, and convictions <span
id="fr_3296"></span>[3297](#fn_3296) of heart, pricking and piercing
each conscience. “The people shall fall under Thee,” <span
id="fr_3297"></span>[3298](#fn_3297) that is, in adoration. Thus is the
Creator’s Christ mighty in war, and a bearer of arms; thus also does He
now take the spoils, not of Samaria alone, but of all nations.
Acknowledge, then, that His spoils are figurative, since you have
learned that His arms are allegorical. Since, therefore, both the Lord
speaks and His apostle writes such things <span
id="fr_3298"></span>[3299](#fn_3298) in a figurative style, we are not
rash in using His interpretations, the records <span
id="fr_3299"></span>[3300](#fn_3299) of which even our adversaries
admit; and thus in *so* far will it be Isaiah’s Christ who has come, in
*as* far as He was not a warrior, because it is not of such a character
that He is described by Isaiah.
