<p class="c19"><a name="v.viii.lxi-p2"></A>Now you have received your mouth, O man, for the purpose of devouring your food and imbibing your drink: why not, however, for the higher purpose of uttering speech, so as to distinguish yourself from all other animals? Why not rather for preaching <i>the gospel of</i> God, that so you may become even His priest and advocate before men?&#160; Adam indeed gave their several names to the animals, before he plucked the fruit of the tree; before he ate, he prophesied. Then, again, you received your teeth for the consumption of your meal: why not rather for wreathing your mouth with suitable defence on every opening thereof, small or wide? Why not, too, for moderating the impulses of your tongue, and guarding your articulate speech from failure and violence? Let me tell you, (if you do not know), that there are toothless persons in the world. Look at them, and ask whether even a cage of teeth be not an honour to the mouth.&#160; There are apertures in the lower regions of man and woman, by means of which they gratify no doubt their animal passions; but why are they not rather regarded as outlets for the cleanly <A NAME="page_593"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 593</FONT></A> <a name="v.viii.lxi-Page_593"></A>discharge of natural fluids? Women, moreover, have within them receptacles where human seed may collect; but are they not designed for the secretion of those sanguineous issues, which their tardier and weaker sex is inadequate to disperse? For even details like these require to be mentioned, seeing that <i>heretics</i> single out what parts of our bodies may suit them, handle them without delicacy, and, as their whim suggests, pour torrents of scorn and contempt upon the natural functions of our members, for the purpose of upsetting the resurrection, and making us blush over their cavils; not reflecting that before the functions cease, the very causes of them will have passed away. There will be no more meat, because no more hunger; no more drink, because no more thirst; no more concubinage, because no more child-bearing; no more eating and drinking, because no more labour and toil. Death, too, will cease; so there will be no more need of the nutriment of food for the defence of life, nor will <i>mothers&#146;</i> limbs any longer have to be laden for the replenishment of our race. But even in the present life there may be cessations of their office for our stomachs and our generative organs. For forty days Moses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7748"></A><A HREF="#fn_7748"><FONT SIZE="1">7749</FONT></A>
 and Elias&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7749"></A><A HREF="#fn_7749"><FONT SIZE="1">7750</FONT></A>
 fasted, and lived upon God alone. For even so early was the principle consecrated:&#160; &#8220;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7750"></A><A HREF="#fn_7750"><FONT SIZE="1">7751</FONT></A>
 See here faint outlines of our future strength! We even, as we may be able, excuse our mouths from food, and withdraw our sexes from union. How many voluntary eunuchs are there! How many virgins espoused to Christ! How many, both of men and women, whom nature has made sterile, with a structure which cannot procreate! Now, if even here on earth both the functions and the pleasures of our members may be suspended, with an intermission which, like the dispensation itself, can only be a temporary one, and yet man&#146;s safety is nevertheless unimpaired, how much more, when his salvation is secure, and especially in an eternal dispensation, shall we not cease to desire those things, for which, even here below, we are not unaccustomed to check our longings!</p>
