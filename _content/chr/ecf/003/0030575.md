<span id="v.vii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Christ Born of a Virgin, of Her
Substance. The Physiological Facts of His Real and Exact Birth of a
Human Mother, as Suggested by Certain Passages of Scripture.</span>

<span id="v.vii.xx-p2"></span>But to what shifts you resort, in your
attempt to rob the syllable *ex* (*of*) <span
id="fr_7210"></span>[7211](#fn_7210) of its proper force as a
preposition, and to substitute another for it in a sense not found
throughout the Holy Scriptures!  You say that He was born
*through* <span id="fr_7211"></span>[7212](#fn_7211) a virgin, not
*of* <span id="fr_7212"></span>[7213](#fn_7212) a virgin, and *in* a
womb, not *of* a womb, because the angel in the dream said to Joseph,
“That which is born in her” (not of her) “is of the Holy Ghost.” <span
id="fr_7213"></span>[7214](#fn_7213) But the fact is, if he had meant
“of her,” he must have said “in her;” for that which was of her, was
also in her. The angel’s expression, therefore, “in her,” has precisely
the same meaning as the phrase “of her.” It is, however, a fortunate
circumstance that Matthew also, when tracing down the Lord’s descent
from Abraham to Mary, says, “Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, *of
whom* was born Christ.” <span id="fr_7214"></span>[7215](#fn_7214) But
Paul, too, silences these critics <span
id="fr_7215"></span>[7216](#fn_7215) when he says, “God sent forth His
Son, made of a woman.” <span id="fr_7216"></span>[7217](#fn_7216) Does
he mean *through* a woman, or *in* a woman? Nay more, for the sake of
greater emphasis, he uses the word “*made*” rather than *born*, although
the use of the latter expression would have been simpler.  But by saying
“*made*,” he not only confirmed the statement, “The Word was made
flesh,” <span id="fr_7217"></span>[7218](#fn_7217) but he also asserted
the reality of the flesh which was made of a virgin. We shall have also
the support of the Psalms on this point, not the “Psalms” indeed of
Valentinus the apostate, and heretic, and Platonist, but the Psalms of
David, the most illustrious saint and well-known prophet. He sings to us
of Christ, and through his voice Christ indeed also sang concerning
Himself. Hear, then, Christ the Lord speaking to God the Father: “Thou
art He that didst draw <span id="fr_7218"></span>[7219](#fn_7218) me out
of my <span id="page_539">p. 539</span> <span
id="v.vii.xx-Page_539"></span>mother’s womb.” <span
id="fr_7219"></span>[7220](#fn_7219) Here is the first point. “Thou art
my hope from my mother’s breasts; upon Thee have I been cast from the
womb.” <span id="fr_7220"></span>[7221](#fn_7220) Here is another point.
“Thou art my God from my mother’s belly.” <span
id="fr_7221"></span>[7222](#fn_7221) Here is a third point. Now let us
carefully attend to the sense of these passages. “Thou didst draw me,”
He says, “out of the womb.” Now what is it which is *drawn*, if it be
not that which adheres, that which is firmly fastened to anything from
which it is drawn in order to be sundered? If He clove not to the womb,
how could He have been drawn from it? If He who clove thereto was drawn
from it, how could He have adhered to it, if it were not that, all the
while He was in the womb, He was tied to it, as to His origin, <span
id="fr_7222"></span>[7223](#fn_7222) by the umbilical cord, which
communicated growth to Him from the matrix? Even when one strange matter
amalgamates with another, it becomes so entirely incorporated <span
id="fr_7223"></span>[7224](#fn_7223) with that with which it
amalgamates, that when it is drawn off from it, it carries with it some
part of the body from which it is torn, as if in consequence of the
severance of the union and growth which the constituent pieces had
communicated to each other.  But what were His “mother’s breasts” which
He mentions? No doubt they were those which He sucked. Midwives, and
doctors, and naturalists, can tell us, from the nature of women’s
breasts, whether they usually flow at any other time than when the womb
is affected with pregnancy, when the veins convey therefrom the blood of
the lower parts <span id="fr_7224"></span>[7225](#fn_7224) to the
*mamilla*, and in the act of transference convert the secretion into the
nutritious <span id="fr_7225"></span>[7226](#fn_7225) substance of milk.
Whence it comes to pass that during the period of lactation the monthly
issues are suspended. But if the Word was made flesh of Himself without
any communication with a womb, no mother’s womb operating upon Him with
its usual function and support, how could the lacteal fountain have been
conveyed (from the womb) to the breasts, since (the womb) can only
effect the change by actual possession *of the proper substance*? But it
could not possibly have had blood for transformation into milk, unless
it possessed the causes of blood also, that is to say, the severance (by
birth) <span id="fr_7226"></span>[7227](#fn_7226) of its own flesh *from
the mother’s womb*. Now it is easy to see what was the novelty of
Christ’s being born of a virgin. It was simply this, that (He was born)
of a virgin in the real manner which we have indicated, in order that
our regeneration might have virginal purity,—spiritually cleansed from
all pollutions through Christ, who was Himself a virgin, even in the
flesh, in that He was *born* of a virgin’s flesh.
