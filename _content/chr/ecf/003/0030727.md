<span id="vi.iii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Use Made of Water by the Heathen.
Type of the Angel at the Pool of Bethsaida. <span
id="fr_8567"></span>[8568](#fn_8567) </span>

<span id="vi.iii.v-p3"></span>“Well, but the nations, who are strangers
to all understanding of spiritual powers, ascribe to their idols the
imbuing of waters with the self-same efficacy.” (So they do) but they
cheat themselves with waters which are widowed. <span
id="fr_8568"></span>[8569](#fn_8568) For washing is the channel through
which they are initiated into some sacred rites—of some notorious Isis
or Mithras. The gods themselves likewise they honour by washings.
Moreover, by carrying water around, and sprinkling it, they everywhere
expiate <span id="fr_8569"></span>[8570](#fn_8569) country-seats,
houses, temples, and whole cities: at all events, at the Apollinarian
and Eleusinian games they are baptized; and they presume that the effect
of their doing that is their regeneration and the remission of the
penalties due to their perjuries. Among the ancients, again, whoever had
defiled himself with murder, was wont to go in quest of purifying
waters. Therefore, if the mere nature of water, in that it is the
appropriate material for washing away, leads men to flatter themselves
with a belief in omens of purification, how much more truly will waters
render that service through the authority of God, by whom all their
nature has been constituted! If men think that water is endued with a
medicinal virtue by religion, what religion is more effectual than that
of the living God?  Which fact being acknowledged, we recognise here
also the zeal of the devil rivalling the things of God, <span
id="fr_8570"></span>[8571](#fn_8570) while we find him, too, practising
baptism in his *subjects*. What similarity is there? The unclean
cleanses! the ruiner sets free! the damned absolves! He will, forsooth,
destroy his own work, by washing away the sins which himself inspires!
These (remarks) have been set down by way of testimony against such as
reject the faith; if they put no trust in the things of God, the
spurious imitations of which, in the case of God’s rival, they do trust
in. Are there not other cases too, in which, without any sacrament,
unclean spirits brood on waters, in spurious imitation of that
brooding <span id="fr_8571"></span>[8572](#fn_8571) of the Divine Spirit
in the very beginning?  Witness all shady founts, and all unfrequented
brooks, and the ponds in the baths, and the conduits <span
id="fr_8572"></span>[8573](#fn_8572) in *private* houses, or the
cisterns and wells which are said to have the property of “spiriting
away,” <span id="fr_8573"></span>[8574](#fn_8573) through the power,
that is, of a hurtful spirit. Men whom waters have drowned <span
id="fr_8574"></span>[8575](#fn_8574) or affected with madness or with
fear, they call nymph-caught, <span id="fr_8575"></span>[8576](#fn_8575)
or “lymphatic,” or “hydro-phobic.” Why have we adduced these instances?
Lest any think it too hard *for belief* that a holy angel of God should
grant his presence to waters, to temper them to man’s salvation; while
the evil angel holds frequent profane commerce with the selfsame element
to man’s ruin. If it seems a novelty for an angel to be present in
waters, an example of what was to come to pass has forerun. An angel, by
his intervention, was wont to stir the pool at Bethsaida. <span
id="fr_8576"></span>[8577](#fn_8576) They who were complaining of
ill-health used to watch for him; for whoever had been the first to
descend into them, after his washing, ceased to complain. This figure of
corporeal healing sang of a <span id="page_672">p. 672</span> <span
id="vi.iii.v-Page_672"></span>spiritual healing, according to the rule
by which things carnal are always antecedent <span
id="fr_8577"></span>[8578](#fn_8577) as figurative of things spiritual.
And thus, when the grace of God advanced to higher degrees among
men, <span id="fr_8578"></span>[8579](#fn_8578) an accession *of
efficacy* was granted to the waters and to the angel. They who <span
id="fr_8579"></span>[8580](#fn_8579) were wont to remedy bodily
defects, <span id="fr_8580"></span>[8581](#fn_8580) now heal the spirit;
they who used to work temporal salvation <span
id="fr_8581"></span>[8582](#fn_8581) now renew eternal; they who did set
free but once in the year, now save peoples in a body <span
id="fr_8582"></span>[8583](#fn_8582) daily, death being done away
through ablution of sins. The guilt being removed, of course the penalty
is removed too. Thus man will be restored for God to His “likeness,” who
in days bygone had been *conformed* to “the image” of God; (the “image”
is counted (to be) in his *form*: the “likeness” in his *eternity*:) for
he receives again that Spirit of God which he had then first received
from His *afflatus*, but had afterward lost through sin.
