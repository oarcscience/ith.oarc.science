<span id="v.v.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—The Gradual Development of
Cosmical Order Out of Chaos in the Creation, Beautifully Stated.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxix-p2"></span>God, indeed, consummated all His works in
a due order; at first He paled them out, <span
id="fr_6398"></span>[6399](#fn_6398) as it were, in their unformed
elements, and then He arranged them <span
id="fr_6399"></span>[6400](#fn_6399) in their finished beauty. For He
did not all at once inundate light with the splendour of the sun, nor
all at once temper darkness with the moon’s assuaging ray. <span
id="fr_6400"></span>[6401](#fn_6400) The heaven He did not all at once
bedeck <span id="fr_6401"></span>[6402](#fn_6401) with constellations
and stars, nor did He at once fill the seas with their teeming
monsters. <span id="fr_6402"></span>[6403](#fn_6402) The earth itself He
did not endow with its varied fruitfulness all at once; but at first He
bestowed upon it being, and then He filled it, that it might not be made
in vain. <span id="fr_6403"></span>[6404](#fn_6403) For thus says
Isaiah: “He created it not in vain; He formed it to be inhabited.” <span
id="fr_6404"></span>[6405](#fn_6404) Therefore after it was made, and
while awaiting its perfect state, <span
id="fr_6405"></span>[6406](#fn_6405) it was “without form, and void:”
“void” indeed, from the very fact that it was without form (as being not
yet perfect to the sight, and at the same time unfurnished as yet with
its other qualities); <span id="fr_6406"></span>[6407](#fn_6406) and
“without form,” because it was still covered with waters, as if with the
rampart of its fecundating moisture, <span
id="fr_6407"></span>[6408](#fn_6407) by which is produced our flesh, in
a form allied with its own. For to this purport does David say: <span
id="fr_6408"></span>[6409](#fn_6408) “The earth is the Lord’s, and the
fulness thereof; the world, and all that dwell therein:  He hath founded
it upon the seas, and on the streams hath He established it.” <span
id="fr_6409"></span>[6410](#fn_6409) It was when the waters were
withdrawn into their hollow abysses that the dry land became
conspicuous, <span id="fr_6410"></span>[6411](#fn_6410) which was
hitherto covered with its watery envelope. Then it forthwith becomes
“visible,” <span id="fr_6411"></span>[6412](#fn_6411) God saying, “Let
the water be gathered together into one mass, <span
id="fr_6412"></span>[6413](#fn_6412) and let the dry land appear.” <span
id="fr_6413"></span>[6414](#fn_6413) “*Appear*,” says He, not “*be
made*.” It had been already made, only in its invisible condition it was
then waiting <span id="fr_6414"></span>[6415](#fn_6414) to appear.
“Dry,” because it was about to become such by its severance from the
moisture, but yet “land.” “And God called the dry land *Earth*,” <span
id="fr_6415"></span>[6416](#fn_6415) not Matter. And so, when it
afterwards attains its perfection, it ceases to be accounted void, when
God declares, “Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed
after its kind, and according to its likeness, and the fruit-tree
yielding fruit, whose seed is in itself, after its kind.” <span
id="fr_6416"></span>[6417](#fn_6416) Again:  “Let the earth bring forth
the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping things, and
beasts of the earth, after their kind.” <span
id="fr_6417"></span>[6418](#fn_6417) Thus the divine Scripture
accomplished its full order. For to that, which it had at first
described as “without form (invisible) and void,” it gave both
visibility and completion. Now no other Matter was “without form
(invisible) and void.” <span id="page_494">p. 494</span> <span
id="v.v.xxix-Page_494"></span>Henceforth, then, Matter will have to be
visible and complete. So that I must <span
id="fr_6418"></span>[6419](#fn_6418) see Matter, since it has become
visible.  I must likewise recognize it as a completed thing, so as to be
able to gather from it the herb bearing seed, and the tree yielding
fruit, and that living creatures, made out of it, may minister to my
need. Matter, however, is nowhere, <span
id="fr_6419"></span>[6420](#fn_6419) but the Earth is here, confessed to
my view.  I see it, I enjoy it, ever since it ceased to be “without form
(invisible), and void.” Concerning it most certainly did Isaiah speak
when he said, “Thus saith the Lord that created the heavens, He was the
God that formed the earth, and made it.” <span
id="fr_6420"></span>[6421](#fn_6420) The same earth for certain did He
form, which He also made. Now how did He form <span
id="fr_6421"></span>[6422](#fn_6421) it? Of course by saying, “Let the
dry land appear.” <span id="fr_6422"></span>[6423](#fn_6422) Why does He
command it to appear, if it were not previously invisible? *His purpose
was* also, that He might thus prevent His having made it in vain, by
rendering it visible, and so fit for use. And thus, throughout, proofs
arise to us that this earth which we inhabit is the very same which was
both created and formed <span id="fr_6423"></span>[6424](#fn_6423) by
God, and that none other was “Without form, and void,” than that which
had been created and formed. It therefore follows that the sentence,
“Now the earth was without form, and void,” applies to that same earth
which God mentioned separately along with the heaven. <span
id="fr_6424"></span>[6425](#fn_6424)
