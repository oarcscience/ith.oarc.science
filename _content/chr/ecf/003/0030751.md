<span id="vi.iv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The Sixth Clause.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vii-p2"></span>It was suitable that, after contemplating
the liberality of God, <span id="fr_8807"></span>[8808](#fn_8807) we
should likewise address His clemency.  For what will aliments <span
id="fr_8808"></span>[8809](#fn_8808) <span id="page_684">p. 684</span>
<span id="vi.iv.vii-Page_684"></span>profit us, if we are really
*consigned* to them, as it were a bull destined for a victim? <span
id="fr_8809"></span>[8810](#fn_8809) The Lord knew Himself to be the
only guiltless One, and so He teaches that we beg “to have our debts
remitted us.” A petition for pardon is a full confession; because he who
begs for pardon fully admits his guilt. Thus, too, penitence is
demonstrated acceptable to God who desires it rather than the death of
the sinner. <span id="fr_8810"></span>[8811](#fn_8810) Moreover, *debt*
is, in the Scriptures, a figure of *guilt*; because it is equally due to
the sentence of judgment, and is exacted by it: nor does it evade the
justice of exaction, unless the exaction be remitted, just as the lord
remitted to that slave *in the parable* his debt; <span
id="fr_8811"></span>[8812](#fn_8811) for hither does the scope of the
whole parable tend. For the fact withal, that the same servant, after
liberated by his lord, does not equally spare his own debtor; and, being
on that account impeached before his lord, is made over to the tormentor
to pay the uttermost farthing—that is, every guilt, however small:
corresponds with our profession that “we also remit to our debtors;”
indeed elsewhere, too, in conformity with this Form of Prayer, He saith,
“Remit, and it shall be remitted you.” <span
id="fr_8812"></span>[8813](#fn_8812) And when Peter had put the question
whether remission were to be granted to a brother seven times, “Nay,”
saith He, “seventy-seven times;” <span
id="fr_8813"></span>[8814](#fn_8813) in order to remould the Law for the
better; because in Genesis *vengeance* was assigned “seven times” in the
case of Cain, but in that of Lamech “seventy-seven times.” <span
id="fr_8814"></span>[8815](#fn_8814)
