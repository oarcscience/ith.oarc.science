<span id="v.iv.ii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—The Lateness of the Revelation
of Marcion’s God. The Question of the Place Occupied by the Rival
Deities. Instead of Two Gods, Marcion Really (Although, as It Would
Seem, Unconsciously) Had Nine Gods in His System.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xv-p2"></span>After all, or, if you like, <span
id="fr_2501"></span>[2502](#fn_2501) before all, since you have said
that he has a creation <span id="fr_2502"></span>[2503](#fn_2502) of his
own, and his own world, and his own sky; we shall see, <span
id="fr_2503"></span>[2504](#fn_2503) indeed, about that third heaven,
when we come to discuss even your own apos<span id="page_282">p.
282</span> <span id="v.iv.ii.xv-Page_282"></span>tle. <span
id="fr_2504"></span>[2505](#fn_2504) Meanwhile, whatever is the
(created) substance, it ought at any rate to have made its appearance in
company with its own god. But now, how happens it that the Lord has been
revealed since the twelfth year of Tiberius Cæsar, while no creation of
His at all has been discovered up to the fifteenth of the Emperor
Severus; <span id="fr_2505"></span>[2506](#fn_2505) although, as being
more excellent than the paltry works <span
id="fr_2506"></span>[2507](#fn_2506) of the Creator, it should certainly
have ceased to conceal itself, when its lord and author no longer lies
hid? I ask, therefore, <span id="fr_2507"></span>[2508](#fn_2507) if it
was unable to manifest itself in this world, how did its Lord appear in
this world? If this world received its Lord, why was it not able to
receive the created substance, unless perchance it was greater than its
Lord? But now there arises a question about place, having reference both
to the world above and to the God thereof. For, behold, if he <span
id="fr_2508"></span>[2509](#fn_2508) has his own world beneath him,
above the Creator, he has certainly fixed it in a position, the space of
which was empty between his own feet and the Creator’s head. Therefore
God both Himself occupied local space, and caused the world to occupy
local space; and this local space, too, will be greater than God and the
world together. For in no case is that which contains not greater than
that which is contained.  And indeed we must look well to it that no
small patches <span id="fr_2509"></span>[2510](#fn_2509) be left here
and there vacant, in which some third god also may be able with a world
of his own to foist himself in. <span
id="fr_2510"></span>[2511](#fn_2510) Now, begin to reckon up your gods.
There will be local space for a god, not only as being greater than God,
but as being also unbegotten and unmade, and therefore eternal, and
equal to God, in which God has ever been. Then, inasmuch as He too has
fabricated <span id="fr_2511"></span>[2512](#fn_2511) a world out of
some underlying material which is unbegotten, and unmade, and
contemporaneous with God, just as Marcion holds of the Creator, you
reduce this likewise to the dignity of that local space which has
enclosed two gods, both God and matter. For matter also is a god
according to the rule of Deity, being (to be sure) unbegotten, and
unmade, and eternal. If, however, it was out of nothing that he made his
world, this also (our heretic) will be obliged to predicate <span
id="fr_2512"></span>[2513](#fn_2512) of the Creator, to whom he
subordinates <span id="fr_2513"></span>[2514](#fn_2513) matter in the
substance of the world.  But it will be only right that he <span
id="fr_2514"></span>[2515](#fn_2514) too should have made his world out
of matter, because the same process occurred to him as God which lay
before the Creator as equally God. And thus you may, if you please,
reckon up so far, <span id="fr_2515"></span>[2516](#fn_2515) three gods
as Marcion’s,—the Maker, local space, and matter. Furthermore, <span
id="fr_2516"></span>[2517](#fn_2516) he in like manner makes the Creator
a god in local space, which is itself to be appraised on a precisely
identical scale of dignity; and to Him as its lord he subordinates
matter, which is notwithstanding unbegotten, and unmade, and by reason
hereof eternal. With this matter he further associates evil, an
unbegotten principle with an unbegotten object, an unmade with an
unmade, and an eternal with an eternal; so here he makes a fourth God.
Accordingly you have three substances of Deity in the higher instances,
and in the lower ones four. When to these are added their Christs—the
one which appeared in the time of Tiberius, the other which is promised
by the Creator—Marcion suffers a manifest wrong from those persons who
assume that he holds two gods, whereas he implies <span
id="fr_2517"></span>[2518](#fn_2517) no less than nine, <span
id="fr_2518"></span>[2519](#fn_2518) though he knows it not.

of our author’s work against Marcion, but supplies us with evidence that
his total lapse must have been very late in life. For the five books,
written at intervals and marked by progressive tokens of his spiritual
decline, are as a whole, only slightly offensive to Orthodoxy. This
should be borne in mind.\]

(2) His Christ; (3) the *space* in which He dwells; (4) the *matter* of
*His* creation; (5) the Demiurge (or Marcion’s “Creator”); (6) his
promised Christ; (7) the *space* which contains him; (8) this world, his
creation; (9) evil, inherent in it.
