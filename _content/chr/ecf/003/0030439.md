<span id="v.iv.v.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL.—How the Steps in the Passion of
the Saviour Were Predetermined in Prophecy. The Passover. The Treachery
of Judas. The Institution of the Lord’s Supper. The Docetic Error of
Marcion Confuted by the Body and the Blood of the Lord Jesus
Christ.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xl-p2"></span>In like manner does He also know the very
time it behoved Him to suffer, since the law prefigures His passion.
Accordingly, of all the festal days of the Jews He chose the
passover. <span id="fr_5069"></span>[5070](#fn_5069) In this Moses had
declared that there was a sacred mystery: <span
id="fr_5070"></span>[5071](#fn_5070) “It is the Lord’s passover.” <span
id="fr_5071"></span>[5072](#fn_5071) How earnestly, therefore, does He
manifest the bent of His soul: “With desire I have desired to eat this
passover with you before I suffer.” <span
id="fr_5072"></span>[5073](#fn_5072) What a destroyer of the law was
this, who actually longed to keep <span id="page_418">p. 418</span>
<span id="v.iv.v.xl-Page_418"></span>its passover!  Could it be that He
was so fond of Jewish lamb? <span id="fr_5073"></span>[5074](#fn_5073)
But was it not because He had to be “led like a lamb to the slaughter;
and because, as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so was He not to
open His mouth,” <span id="fr_5074"></span>[5075](#fn_5074) that He so
profoundly wished to accomplish the symbol of His own redeeming blood?
He might also have been betrayed by any stranger, did I not find that
even here too He fulfilled a Psalm: “He who did eat bread with me hath
lifted up <span id="fr_5075"></span>[5076](#fn_5075) his heel against
me.” <span id="fr_5076"></span>[5077](#fn_5076) And without a price
might He have been betrayed. For what need of a traitor was there in the
case of one who offered Himself to the people openly, and might quite as
easily have been captured by force as taken by treachery? This might no
doubt have been well enough for another Christ, but would not have been
suitable in One who was accomplishing prophecies. For it was written,
“The righteous one did they sell for silver.” <span
id="fr_5077"></span>[5078](#fn_5077) The very amount and the
destination <span id="fr_5078"></span>[5079](#fn_5078) of the money,
which on Judas’ remorse was recalled *from its first purpose of a
fee*, <span id="fr_5079"></span>[5080](#fn_5079) and appropriated to the
purchase of a potter’s field, as narrated in the Gospel of Matthew, were
clearly foretold by Jeremiah: <span id="fr_5080"></span>[5081](#fn_5080)
“And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who was
valued <span id="fr_5081"></span>[5082](#fn_5081) and gave them for the
potter’s field.”  When He so earnestly expressed His desire to eat the
passover, He considered it *His own* feast; for it would have been
unworthy of God to desire to partake of what was not His own. Then,
having taken the bread and given it to His disciples, He made it His own
body, by saying, “This is my body,” <span
id="fr_5082"></span>[5083](#fn_5082) that is, the figure of my body. A
figure, however, there could not have been, unless there were first a
veritable body. <span id="fr_5083"></span>[5084](#fn_5083) An empty
thing, or phantom, is incapable of a figure. If, however, (as Marcion
might say,) He pretended the bread was His body, because He lacked the
truth of bodily substance, it follows that He must have given bread for
us. It would contribute very well to the support of Marcion’s theory of
a phantom body, <span id="fr_5084"></span>[5085](#fn_5084) that bread
should have been crucified!  But why call His body bread, and not rather
(some other edible thing, say) a melon, <span
id="fr_5085"></span>[5086](#fn_5085) which Marcion must have had in lieu
of a heart!  He did not understand how ancient was this figure of the
body of Christ, who said Himself by Jeremiah: “I was like a lamb or an
ox that is brought to the slaughter, and I knew not that <span
id="fr_5086"></span>[5087](#fn_5086) they devised a device against me,
saying, *Let us cast the tree upon His bread*,” <span
id="fr_5087"></span>[5088](#fn_5087) which means, of course, the cross
upon His body. And thus, casting light, as He always did, upon the
ancient prophecies, <span id="fr_5088"></span>[5089](#fn_5088) He
declared plainly enough what He meant by the *bread*, when He called the
bread His own body. He likewise, when mentioning the cup and making the
*new* testament to be sealed “in His blood,” <span
id="fr_5089"></span>[5090](#fn_5089) affirms the reality of His body.
For no blood can belong to a body which is not *a body* of flesh. If any
sort of body were presented to our view, which is not one of flesh, not
being fleshly, it would not possess blood. Thus, from the evidence of
the flesh, we get a proof of the body, and a proof of the flesh from the
evidence of the blood. In order, however, that you may discover how
anciently wine is used as a figure for blood, turn to Isaiah, who asks,
“Who is this that cometh from Edom, from Bosor with garments dyed in
red, so glorious in His apparel, in the greatness of his might? Why are
thy garments red, and thy raiment as his who cometh from the treading of
the full winepress?” <span id="fr_5090"></span>[5091](#fn_5090) The
prophetic Spirit contemplates the Lord as if He were already on His way
to His passion, clad in His fleshly nature; and as He was to suffer
therein, He represents the bleeding condition of His flesh under the
metaphor of garments dyed in red, as if reddened in the treading and
crushing process of the wine-press, from which the labourers descend
reddened with the wine-juice, like men stained in blood.  Much more
clearly still does the book of Genesis foretell this, when <span
id="page_419">p. 419</span> <span id="v.iv.v.xl-Page_419"></span>(in the
blessing of Judah, out of whose tribe Christ was to come according to
the flesh) it even then delineated Christ in the person of that
patriarch, <span id="fr_5091"></span>[5092](#fn_5091) saying, “He washed
His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of grapes” <span
id="fr_5092"></span>[5093](#fn_5092) —in His garments and clothes the
prophecy pointed out his flesh, and His blood in the wine. Thus did He
now consecrate His blood in wine, who then (by the patriarch) used the
figure of wine to describe His blood.

<span id="v.iv.v.xl-p14"></span> This passage more nearly resembles
[Zech. 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#012),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#013)<span id="v.iv.v.xl-p14.1"></span>
than anything in Jeremiah, although the transaction in [Jer. xxxii.
7-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#007)<span id="v.iv.v.xl-p14.2"></span>
is noted by the commentators, as referred to. Tertullian had good reason
for mentioning Jeremiah and not Zechariah, because the apostle whom he
refers to ([Matt. xxvii. 3-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#003)<span
id="v.iv.v.xl-p14.3"></span>) had distinctly attributed the prophecy to
Jeremiah (“Jeremy the prophet,” [Matt.
27.9](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#009)<span
id="v.iv.v.xl-p14.4"></span>). This is not the place to do more than
merely refer to the voluminous controversy which has arisen from the
apostle’s mention of <span class="sc"><span
id="v.iv.v.xl-p14.6"></span>Jeremiah</span> instead of Zechariah. It is
enough to remark that Tertullian’s argument is unaffected by the
discrepancy in the name of the particular prophet. On all hands *the
prophecy* is admitted, and this at once satisfies our author’s
argument.  For the <span class="sc"><span
id="v.iv.v.xl-p14.7"></span>ms.</span> evidence in favour of the
unquestionably correct reading, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.v.xl-p14.8"></span>τότε ἐπληρώθη τὸ ῥηθὲν διὰ ῾Ιερεμίου τοῦ
προφήτου, κ.τ.λ</span>., the reader is referred to Dr. Tregelles’
*Critical Greek Testament, in loc.*; only to the convincing amount of
evidence collected by the very learned editor must now be added the
subsequently obtained authority of Tischendorf’s *Codex Sinaiticus*.
