id="v.iii.i-p6.1"></span>Chapter I.—Introductory. Heresies Must Exist,
and Even Abound; They are a Probation to Faith.</span>

<span id="v.iii.i-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.iii.i-p7.1"></span>The</span> character of the times in which we
live is such as to call forth from us even this admonition, that we
ought not to be astonished at the heresies (which abound) <span
id="fr_1850"></span>[1851](#fn_1850) neither ought their existence to
surprise us, for it was foretold that they should come to pass; <span
id="fr_1851"></span>[1852](#fn_1851) nor the fact that they subvert the
faith of some, for their final cause is, by affording a trial to faith,
to give it also the opportunity of being “approved.” <span
id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852) Groundless, therefore, and
inconsiderate is the offence of the many <span
id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853) who are scandalized by the very
fact that heresies prevail to such a degree. How great (might their
offence have been) if they had not existed. <span
id="fr_1854"></span>[1855](#fn_1854) When it has been determined that a
thing must by all means be, it receives the (final) cause for which it
has its being. This secures the power through which it exists, in such a
way that it is impossible for it not to have existence.

<span id="v.iii.i-p3"></span> Of the various forms of the title of this
treatise, *de Præscriptione Hæreticorum,* *de Præscriptionibus
Hæreticorum,* *de Præscriptionibus adversus Hæreticos*, the first is
adopted by Oehler after the oldest authorities, such as the Liber
Argobardinus and the Codex Paterniacensis (or Seletstadiensis), and the
Editio Princeps of Rhenanus. The term *præscriptio* is a legal one,
meaning a *demurrer*, or formal objection. The genitive *hæreticorum* is
used in an objective sense, as if *adversus hæreticos*. Tertullian
himself, in *de Carne Christi*, ii. says, “Sed plenius ejusmodi
præscriptionibus adversus omnes hæreses alibi jam usi sumus.” The title
therefore means, “On the Church’s Prescriptive Rule against Heresies of
all kinds.” \[Elucidation I.\]
