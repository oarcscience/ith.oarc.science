<span id="v.iv.ii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Defence of the Divine Unity
Against Objection. No Analogy Between Human Powers and God’s
Sovereignty. The Objection Otherwise Untenable, for Why Stop at Two
Gods?</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.iv-p2"></span>But some one may contend that two great
Supremes may exist, distinct and separate in their own departments; and
may even adduce, as an example, the kingdoms of the world, which, though
they are so many in number, are yet supreme in their several regions.
Such a man will suppose that human circumstances are always comparable
with divine ones. Now, if this mode of reasoning be at all tolerable,
what is to prevent our introducing, I will not say a third god or a
fourth, but as many as there are kings of the earth? Now it is God that
is in question, whose main property it is to admit of no comparison with
Himself. Nature itself, therefore, if not an Isaiah, or rather God
speaking by Isaiah, will deprecatingly ask, “To whom will ye liken
me?” <span id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369) Human circumstances may
perhaps be compared with divine ones, but they may not be with God.  God
is one thing, and what belongs to God is another thing. Once more: <span
id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370) you who apply the example of a
king, as a great <span id="page_274">p. 274</span> <span
id="v.iv.ii.iv-Page_274"></span>supreme, take care that you can use it
properly. For although a king is supreme on his throne next to God, he
is still inferior to God; and when he is compared with God, he will be
dislodged <span id="fr_2371"></span>[2372](#fn_2371) from that great
supremacy which is transferred to God. Now, this being the case, how
will you employ in a comparison with God an object as your example,
which fails <span id="fr_2372"></span>[2373](#fn_2372) in all the
purposes which belong to a comparison? Why, when supreme power among
kings cannot evidently be multifarious, but only unique and singular, is
an exception made in the case of Him (of all others) <span
id="fr_2373"></span>[2374](#fn_2373) who is King of kings, and (from the
exceeding greatness of His power, and the subjection of all other
ranks <span id="fr_2374"></span>[2375](#fn_2374) to Him) the very
summit, <span id="fr_2375"></span>[2376](#fn_2375) as it were, of
dominion? But even in the case of rulers of that other form of
government, where they one by one preside in a union of authority, if
with their petty <span id="fr_2376"></span>[2377](#fn_2376) prerogatives
of royalty, so to say, they be brought on all points <span
id="fr_2377"></span>[2378](#fn_2377) into such a comparison with one
another as shall make it clear which of them is superior in the
essential features <span id="fr_2378"></span>[2379](#fn_2378) and powers
of royalty, it must needs follow that the supreme majesty will
redound <span id="fr_2379"></span>[2380](#fn_2379) to one alone,—all the
others being gradually, by the issue of the comparison, removed and
excluded from the supreme authority. Thus, although, when spread out in
several hands, supreme authority seems to be multifarious, yet in its
own powers, nature, and condition, it is unique. It follows, then, that
if two gods are compared, as two kings and two supreme authorities, the
concentration of authority must necessarily, according to the meaning of
the comparison, be conceded to one of the two; because it is clear from
his own superiority that he is the supreme, his rival being now
vanquished, and proved to be not the greater, however great. Now, from
this failure of his rival, the other is unique in power, possessing a
certain solitude, as it were, in his singular pre-eminence. The
inevitable conclusion at which we arrive, then, on this point is this:
either we must deny that God is the great Supreme, which no wise man
will allow himself to do; or say that God has no one else with whom to
share His power.
