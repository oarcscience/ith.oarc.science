<span id="v.iv.ii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Jesus Christ, the Revealer of
the Creator, Could Not Be the Same as Marcion’s God, Who Was Only Made
Known by the Heretic Some CXV. Years After Christ, and That, Too, on a
Principle Utterly Unsuited to the Teaching of Jesus Christ, I.e., the
Opposition Between the Law and the Gospels.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xix-p2"></span>Well, but our god, say the Marcionites,
although he did not manifest himself from the beginning and by means of
the creation, has yet revealed himself in Christ Jesus. A book will be
devoted <span id="fr_2544"></span>[2545](#fn_2544) to Christ, treating
of His entire state; for it is desirable that these subject-matters
should be distinguished one from another, in order that they may receive
a fuller and more methodical treatment. Meanwhile it will be sufficient
if, at this stage of the question, I show—and that but briefly—that
Christ Jesus is the revealer <span id="fr_2545"></span>[2546](#fn_2545)
of none other god but the Creator. In the fifteenth year of
Tiberius, <span id="fr_2546"></span>[2547](#fn_2546) Christ Jesus
vouchsafed to come down from heaven, as the spirit of saving
health. <span id="fr_2547"></span>[2548](#fn_2547) I cared not to
inquire, indeed, in what particular year of the elder Antoninus.  He who
had so gracious a purpose did rather, like a pestilential sirocco, <span
id="fr_2548"></span>[2549](#fn_2548) exhale this health or salvation,
which Marcion teaches from his Pontus. Of this teacher there is no doubt
that he is a heretic of the Antonine period, impious under the pious.
Now, from Tiberius to Antoninus Pius, there are about 115 years and
6-1/2 months.  Just such an interval do they place between Christ and
Marcion. Inasmuch, then, as Marcion, as we have shown, <span
id="page_285">p. 285</span> <span id="v.iv.ii.xix-Page_285"></span>first
introduced this god to notice in the time of Antoninus, the matter
becomes at once clear, if you are a shrewd observer. The dates already
decide the case, that he who came to light for the first time <span
id="fr_2549"></span>[2550](#fn_2549) in the reign of Antoninus, did not
appear in that of Tiberius; in other words, that the God of the Antonine
period was not the God of the Tiberian; and consequently, that he whom
Marcion has plainly preached for the first time, was not revealed by
Christ (who announced His revelation as early as the reign of Tiberius).
Now, to prove clearly what remains of the argument, I shall draw
materials from my very adversaries. Marcion’s special and principal work
is the separation of the law and the gospel; and his disciples will not
deny that in this point they have their very best pretext for initiating
and confirming themselves in his heresy. These are Marcion’s
*Antitheses*, or contradictory propositions, which aim at committing the
gospel to a variance with the law, in order that from the diversity of
the two documents which contain them, <span
id="fr_2550"></span>[2551](#fn_2550) they may contend for a diversity of
gods also.  Since, therefore, it is this very opposition between the law
and the gospel which has suggested that the God of the gospel is
different from the God of the law, it is clear that, before the said
separation, that god could not have been known who became known <span
id="fr_2551"></span>[2552](#fn_2551) from the argument of the separation
itself.  He therefore could not have been revealed by Christ, who came
before the separation, but must have been devised by Marcion, the author
of the breach of peace between the gospel and the law.  Now this peace,
which had remained unhurt and unshaken from Christ’s appearance to the
time of Marcion’s audacious doctrine, was no doubt maintained by that
way of thinking, which firmly held that the God of both law and gospel
was none other than the Creator, against whom after so long a time a
separation has been introduced by the heretic of Pontus.
