id="v.vii.xiii-Page_533"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Christ’s Human Nature.  The
Flesh and the Soul Both Fully and Unconfusedly Contained in It.</span>

<span id="v.vii.xiii-p2"></span>The soul became flesh that the soul
might become visible. <span id="fr_7122"></span>[7123](#fn_7122) Well,
then, did the flesh likewise become soul that the flesh might be
manifested? <span id="fr_7123"></span>[7124](#fn_7123) If the soul is
flesh, it is no longer soul, but flesh. If the flesh is soul, it is no
longer flesh, but soul. Where, then, there is flesh, and where there is
soul, it has become both one and the other. <span
id="fr_7124"></span>[7125](#fn_7124) Now, if they are neither in
particular, although they become both one and the other, it is, to say
the least, very absurd, that we should understand the soul when we name
the flesh, and when we indicate the soul, explain ourselves as meaning
the flesh. All things will be in danger of being taken in a sense
different from their own proper sense, and, whilst taken in that
different sense, of losing their proper one, if they are called by a
name which differs from their natural designation.  Fidelity in names
secures the safe appreciation of properties. When these properties
undergo a change, they are considered to possess such qualities as their
names indicate. Baked clay, for instance, receives the name of
brick. <span id="fr_7125"></span>[7126](#fn_7125) It retains not the
name which designated its former state, <span
id="fr_7126"></span>[7127](#fn_7126) because it has no longer a share in
that state.  Therefore, also, the soul of Christ having become
flesh, <span id="fr_7127"></span>[7128](#fn_7127) cannot be anything
else than that which it has become nor can it be any longer that which
it once was, having become indeed <span
id="fr_7128"></span>[7129](#fn_7128) something else. And since we have
just had recourse to an illustration, we will put it to further use. Our
pitcher, then, which was formed of the clay, is one body, and has one
name indicative, of course, of that one body; nor can the pitcher be
also called clay, because what it once was, it is no longer. Now that
which is no longer (what it was) is also not an inseparable
property. <span id="fr_7129"></span>[7130](#fn_7129) And the soul is not
an inseparable property. Since, therefore, it has become flesh, the soul
is a uniform solid body; it is also a wholly incomplex being, <span
id="fr_7130"></span>[7131](#fn_7130) and an indivisible substance. But
in Christ we find the soul and the flesh expressed in simple
unfigurative <span id="fr_7131"></span>[7132](#fn_7131) terms; that is
to say, the soul is called soul, and the flesh, flesh; nowhere is the
soul termed flesh, or the flesh, soul; and yet they ought to have been
thus (confusedly) named if such had been their condition. *The fact,
however, is* that even by *Christ* Himself each substance has been
separately mentioned by itself, conformably of course, to the
distinction which exists between the properties of both, the soul by
itself, and the flesh by itself.  “*My soul*,” says He, “is exceeding
sorrowful, even unto death;” <span id="fr_7132"></span>[7133](#fn_7132)
and “the bread that I will give is *my flesh*, (which I will give) for
the life <span id="fr_7133"></span>[7134](#fn_7133) of the world.” <span
id="fr_7134"></span>[7135](#fn_7134) Now, if the soul had been flesh,
there would have only been in Christ the soul composed of flesh, or else
the flesh composed of soul. <span id="fr_7135"></span>[7136](#fn_7135)
Since, however, He keeps the species distinct, the flesh and the soul,
He shows them to be two. If two, then they are no longer one; if not
one, then the soul is not composed of flesh, nor the flesh of soul. For
the soul-flesh, or the flesh-soul, is but one; unless indeed He even had
some other soul apart from that which was flesh, and bare about another
flesh besides that which was soul. But since He had but one flesh and
one soul,—that “soul which was sorrowful, even unto death,” and that
*flesh which was the* “bread given for the life of the world,”—the
number is unimpaired <span id="fr_7136"></span>[7137](#fn_7136) of two
substances distinct in kind, thus excluding the unique species of the
flesh-comprised soul.
