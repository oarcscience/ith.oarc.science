<p class="c30"><a name="iv.xi.xlv-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="iv.xi.xlv-p1.1"></A>Chapter XLV.&#8212;Dreams, an Incidental Effect of the Soul&#146;s Activity.&#160; Ecstasy.</span></p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="iv.xi.xlv-p2"></A>We are bound to expound at this point what is the opinion of Christians respecting dreams, as incidents of sleep, and as no slight or trifling excitements of the soul, which we have declared to be always occupied and active owing to its perpetual movement, which again is a proof and evidence of its divine quality and immortality. When, therefore, rest accrues to human bodies, it being their own especial comfort, the soul, disdaining a repose which is not natural to it, never rests; and since it receives no help from the limbs of the body, it uses its own.&#160; Imagine a gladiator without his instruments or arms, and a charioteer without his team, but still gesticulating the entire course and exertion of their respective employments: there is the fight, there is the struggle; but the effort is a vain one. Nevertheless the whole procedure seems to be gone through, although it evidently has not been really effected. There is the act, but not the effect. This power we call <i>ecstasy</i>, in which the sensuous soul stands out of itself, in a way which even resembles madness.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1765"></A><A HREF="#fn_1765"><FONT SIZE="1">1766</FONT></A>
 Thus in the very beginning sleep was inaugurated by ecstasy: &#8220;And God sent an ecstasy upon Adam, and he slept.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1766"></A><A HREF="#fn_1766"><FONT SIZE="1">1767</FONT></A>
 The sleep came on his body to cause it to rest, but the ecstasy fell on his soul to remove rest: from that very circumstance it still happens ordinarily (and from the order results the nature of the case) that sleep is combined with ecstasy. In fact, with what real feeling, and anxiety, and suffering do we experience joy, and sorrow, and alarm in our dreams! Whereas we should not be moved by any such emotions, by what would be the merest fan<A NAME="page_224"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 224</FONT></A> <a name="iv.xi.xlv-Page_224"></A>tasies of course, if when we dream we were masters of ourselves, (unaffected by ecstasy.) In these dreams, indeed, good actions are useless, and crimes harmless; for we shall no more be condemned for visionary acts of sin, than we shall be crowned for imaginary martyrdom. But how, you will ask, can the soul remember its dreams, when it is said to be without any mastery over its own operations? This memory must be an especial gift of the ecstatic condition of which we are treating, since it arises not from any failure of healthy action, but entirely from natural process; nor does it expel mental function&#8212;it withdraws it for a time. It is one thing to shake, it is another thing to move; one thing to destroy, another thing to agitate. That, therefore, which memory supplies betokens soundness of mind; and that which a sound mind ecstatically experiences whilst the memory remains unchecked, is a kind of madness. We are accordingly not said to be mad, but to dream, in that state; to be in the full possession also of our mental faculties,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1767"></A><A HREF="#fn_1767"><FONT SIZE="1">1768</FONT></A>
 if we are at any time. For although the power to exercise these faculties&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1768"></A><A HREF="#fn_1768"><FONT SIZE="1">1769</FONT></A>
 may be dimmed in us, it is still not extinguished; except that it may seem to be itself absent at the very time that the ecstasy is energizing in us in its special manner, in such wise as to bring before us images of a sound mind and of wisdom, even as it does those of aberration.</p>
