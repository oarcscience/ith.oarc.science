<span id="v.iv.ii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—The Goodness of Marcion’s
God Only Imperfectly Manifested; It Saves But Few, and the Souls Merely
of These. Marcion’s Contempt of the Body Absurd.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xxiv-p2"></span>But as God is eternal and rational,
so, I think, He is perfect in all things. “Be ye perfect, even as your
Father which is in heaven is perfect.” <span
id="fr_2618"></span>[2619](#fn_2618) Prove, then, that the goodness of
your god also is a perfect one. That it is indeed *imperfect* has been
already sufficiently shown, since it is found to be neither natural nor
rational. The same conclusion, however, shall now be made clear <span
id="fr_2619"></span>[2620](#fn_2619) by another method; it is not
simply <span id="fr_2620"></span>[2621](#fn_2620) imperfect, but
actually <span id="fr_2621"></span>[2622](#fn_2621) feeble, weak, and
exhausted, failing to embrace the full number <span
id="fr_2622"></span>[2623](#fn_2622) of its material objects, and not
manifesting itself in them all. For all are not put into a state of
salvation <span id="fr_2623"></span>[2624](#fn_2623) by it; but the
Creator’s subjects, both Jew and Christian, are all excepted. <span
id="fr_2624"></span>[2625](#fn_2624) Now, when the greater part thus
perish, how can that goodness be defended as a perfect one which is
inoperative in most cases, is somewhat only in few, naught in many,
succumbs to perdition, and is a partner with destruction? <span
id="fr_2625"></span>[2626](#fn_2625) And if so many shall miss
salvation, it will not be with goodness, but with malignity, that the
greater perfection will lie. For as it is the operation of goodness
which brings salvation, so is it malevolence which thwarts it. <span
id="fr_2626"></span>[2627](#fn_2626) Since, however, this goodness)
saves but few, and so rather leans to the alternative of not saving, it
will show itself to greater perfection by not interposing help than by
helping. Now, you will not be able to attribute goodness (to your god)
in reference to the Creator, (if accompanied with) failure towards all.
For whomsoever you call in to judge the question, it is as a dispenser
of goodness, if so be such a title can be made out, <span
id="fr_2627"></span>[2628](#fn_2627) and not as a squanderer thereof, as
you claim your god to be, that you must submit the divine character for
determination.  So long, then, as you prefer your god to the Creator on
the simple ground of his goodness, and since he professes to have this
attribute as solely and wholly his own, he ought not to have been
wanting in it to any one. However, I do not now wish to prove that
Marcion’s god is imperfect in goodness because of the perdition of the
greater number. I am content to illustrate <span id="page_290">p.
290</span> <span id="v.iv.ii.xxiv-Page_290"></span>this imperfection by
the fact that even those whom he saves are found to possess but an
imperfect salvation—that is, they are saved only so far as the soul is
concerned, <span id="fr_2628"></span>[2629](#fn_2628) but lost in their
body, which, according to him, does not rise again. Now, whence comes
this halving of salvation, if not from a failure of goodness? What could
have been a better proof of a perfect goodness, than the recovery of the
whole man to salvation? Totally damned by the Creator, he should have
been totally restored by the most merciful god. I rather think that by
Marcion’s rule the body is baptized, is deprived of marriage, <span
id="fr_2629"></span>[2630](#fn_2629) is cruelly tortured in confession.
But although sins are attributed to the body, yet they are preceded by
the guilty concupiscence of the soul; nay, the first motion of sin must
be ascribed to the soul, to which the flesh acts in the capacity of a
servant. By and by, when freed from the soul, the flesh sins no
more. <span id="fr_2630"></span>[2631](#fn_2630) So that in this matter
goodness is unjust, and likewise imperfect, in that it leaves to
destruction the more harmless substance, which sins rather by compliance
than in will. Now, although Christ put not on the verity of the flesh,
as your heresy is pleased to assume, He still vouchsafed to take upon
Him the semblance thereof. Surely, therefore, some regard was due to it
from Him, because of this His feigned assumption of it. Besides, what
else is man than flesh, since no doubt it was the corporeal rather than
the spiritual <span id="fr_2631"></span>[2632](#fn_2631) element from
which the Author of man’s nature gave him his designation? <span
id="fr_2632"></span>[2633](#fn_2632) “And the <span class="sc"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xxiv-p17.4"></span>Lord</span> God made man of the dust of
the ground,” not of spiritual essence; this afterwards came from the
divine afflatus:  “and man became a living soul.”  What, then, is man?
Made, no doubt of it, of the dust; and God placed him in paradise,
because He moulded him, not breathed him, into being—a fabric of flesh,
not of spirit. Now, this being the case, with what face will you contend
for the perfect character of that goodness which did not fail in some
one particular only of man’s deliverance, but in its general capacity?
If that is a plenary grace and a substantial mercy which brings
salvation to the soul alone, this were the better life which we now
enjoy whole and entire; whereas to rise again but in part will be a
chastisement, not a liberation.  The proof of the perfect goodness is,
that man, after his rescue, should be delivered from the domicile and
power of the malignant deity unto the protection of the most good and
merciful God.  Poor dupe of Marcion, fever <span
id="fr_2633"></span>[2634](#fn_2633) is hard upon you; and your painful
flesh produces a crop of all sorts of briers and thorns. Nor is it only
to the Creator’s thunderbolts that you lie exposed, or to wars, and
pestilences, and His other heavier strokes, but even to His creeping
insects. In what respect do you suppose yourself liberated from His
kingdom when His flies are still creeping upon your face? If your
deliverance lies in the future, why not also in the present, that it may
be perfectly wrought? Far different is our condition in the sight of Him
who is the Author, the Judge, the injured <span
id="fr_2634"></span>[2635](#fn_2634) Head of our race! You display Him
as a merely good God; but you are unable to prove that He is perfectly
good, because you are not by Him perfectly delivered.
