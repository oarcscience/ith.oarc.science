<span id="v.viii.lix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.lix-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIX.—Our Flesh in the Resurrection
Capable, Without Losing Its Essential Identity, of Bearing the Changed
Conditions of Eternal Life, or of Death Eternal.</span>

<span id="v.viii.lix-p2"></span>But, you object, the world to come bears
the character of a different dispensation, even an eternal one; and
therefore, you maintain, that the non-eternal substance of this life is
incapable of possessing a state of such different features. This would
be true enough, if man were made for the future dispensation, and not
the dispensation for man. The apostle, however, in his epistle says,
“Whether it be the world, or life, or death, or things present, or
things to come; all are yours:” <span
id="fr_7738"></span>[7739](#fn_7738) and he here constitutes us heirs
even of the future world. Isaiah gives you no help when he says, “All
flesh is grass;” <span id="fr_7739"></span>[7740](#fn_7739) and in
another passage, “All flesh shall see the salvation of God.” <span
id="fr_7740"></span>[7741](#fn_7740) It is the issues of men, not their
substances, which he distinguishes. But who does not hold that the
judgment of God consists in the twofold sentence, of salvation and of
punishment? Therefore it is that “all flesh is grass,” which is destined
to the fire; and “all flesh shall see the salvation of God,” which is
ordained to eternal life. For myself, I am quite sure that it is in no
other flesh than my own that I have committed adultery, nor in any other
flesh am I striving after continence. If there be any one who bears
about in his person two instruments of lasciviousness, he has it in his
power, to be sure, to mow down <span
id="fr_7741"></span>[7742](#fn_7741) “the grass” of the unclean flesh,
and to reserve for himself only that which shall see the salvation of
God. But when the same prophet represents to us even nations sometimes
estimated as “the small dust of the balance,” <span
id="fr_7742"></span>[7743](#fn_7742) and as “less than nothing, and
vanity,” <span id="fr_7743"></span>[7744](#fn_7743) and sometimes as
about to hope and “trust in the name” <span
id="fr_7744"></span>[7745](#fn_7744) and arm of the Lord, are we at all
misled respecting the Gentile nations *by the diversity of statement*?
Are some of them to turn believers, and are others accounted dust, from
any difference of nature? Nay, rather Christ has shone as the true light
on the nations within the ocean’s limits, and from the heaven which is
over us all. <span id="fr_7745"></span>[7746](#fn_7745) Why, it is even
on this earth that the Valentinians have gone to school for their
errors; and there will be no difference of condition, as respects their
body and soul, between the nations which believe and those which do not
believe.  Precisely, then, as He has put a distinction of state, not of
nature, amongst the same nations, so also has He discriminated their
flesh, which is one and the same substance in those nations, not
according to their material structure, but according to the recompense
of their merit.
