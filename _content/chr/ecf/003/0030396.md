<span id="v.iv.iv.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—The Success of the Apostles,
and Their Sufferings in the Cause of the Gospel, Foretold.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.xxii-p2"></span>You have the work of the apostles also
predicted: “How beautiful are the feet of them which preach the gospel
of peace, which bring good tidings of good,” <span
id="fr_3399"></span>[3400](#fn_3399) not of war nor evil tidings. In
response to which is the psalm, “Their sound is gone through all the
earth, and their words to the ends of the world;” <span
id="fr_3400"></span>[3401](#fn_3400) that is, the words of them who
carry round about the law that proceeded from Sion and the Lord’s word
from Jerusalem, in order that that might come to pass which was written:
“They who were far from my righteousness, have come near to my
righteousness and truth.” <span id="fr_3401"></span>[3402](#fn_3401)
When the apostles girded their loins for this business, they renounced
the elders and rulers and priests of the Jews. Well, says he, but was it
not above all things that they might preach the other god?  Rather <span
id="fr_3402"></span>[3403](#fn_3402) (that they might preach) that very
self-same God, whose scripture they were with all their might
fulfilling! “Depart ye, depart ye,” exclaims Isaiah; “go ye out from
thence, and touch not the unclean thing,” that is blasphemy against
Christ; “Go ye out of the midst of her,” even of the synagogue. “Be ye
separate who bear the vessels of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3403"></span>[3404](#fn_3403) For already had the Lord, according
to the preceding words (of the prophet), revealed His Holy One with His
arm, that is to say, Christ by His mighty power, in the eyes of the
nations, so that all the <span id="fr_3404"></span>[3405](#fn_3404)
nations and the utmost parts of the earth have seen the salvation, which
was from God. By thus departing from Judaism itself, when they exchanged
the obligations and burdens of the law for the liberty of the gospel,
they were fulfilling the psalm, “Let us burst their bonds asunder, and
cast away their yoke from us;” and this indeed (they did) after that
“the heathen raged, and the people imagined vain devices;” after that
“the kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers took their
counsel together against the Lord, and against His Christ.” <span
id="fr_3405"></span>[3406](#fn_3405) What did the apostles thereupon
suffer? You answer:  Every sort of iniquitous persecutions, from men
that belonged indeed to that Creator who was the adversary of Him whom
they were preaching. Then why does the Creator, if an adversary of
Christ, not only predict that the apostles should incur this suffering,
but even express His displeasure <span
id="fr_3406"></span>[3407](#fn_3406) thereat? For He ought neither to
predict the course of the other god, whom, as you contend, He knew not,
nor to have expressed displeasure at that which He had taken care to
bring about. “See how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to
heart; and how merciful men are taken away, and no man considereth. For
the righteous man has been removed from the evil person.” <span
id="fr_3407"></span>[3408](#fn_3407) Who is this but Christ? “Come, say
they, let us take away the righteous, because He is not for our turn,
(and He is clean contrary to our doings).” <span
id="fr_3408"></span>[3409](#fn_3408) Premising, therefore, and likewise
subjoining the fact that Christ suffered, He foretold that His just ones
should suffer equally with Him—both the apostles and all the faithful in
succession; and He signed them with that very seal of which Ezekiel
spake: “The Lord said unto me, Go through the gate, through the midst of
Jerusalem, and set the mark *Tau* upon the foreheads of the men.” <span
id="fr_3409"></span>[3410](#fn_3409) Now the Greek letter *Tau* and our
own letter T is the very form of the cross, which He predicted would be
the sign on our <span id="page_341">p. 341</span> <span
id="v.iv.iv.xxii-Page_341"></span>foreheads in the true Catholic
Jerusalem, <span id="fr_3410"></span>[3411](#fn_3410) in which,
according to the twenty-first Psalm, the brethren of Christ or children
of God would ascribe glory to God the Father, in the person of Christ
Himself addressing His Father; “I will declare Thy name unto my
brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I sing praise unto
Thee.” For that which had to come to pass in our day in His name, and by
His Spirit, He rightly foretold would be of Him. And a little afterwards
He says: “My praise shall be of Thee in the great congregation.” <span
id="fr_3411"></span>[3412](#fn_3411) In the sixty-seventh Psalm He says
again: “In the congregations bless ye the Lord God.” <span
id="fr_3412"></span>[3413](#fn_3412) So that with this agrees also the
prophecy of Malachi: “I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord; neither
will I accept your offerings: for from the rising of the sun, even unto
the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles;
and in every place sacrifice shall be offered unto my name, and a pure
offering” <span id="fr_3413"></span>[3414](#fn_3413) —such as the
ascription of glory, and blessing, and praise, and hymns. Now, inasmuch
as all these things are also found amongst you, and the sign upon the
forehead, <span id="fr_3414"></span>[3415](#fn_3414) and the sacraments
of the church, and the offerings of the pure sacrifice, you ought now to
burst forth, and declare that the Spirit of the Creator prophesied of
your Christ.
