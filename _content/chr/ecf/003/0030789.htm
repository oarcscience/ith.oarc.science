<p class="c30"><a name="vi.vi.viii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="vi.vi.viii-p1.1"></A>Chapter VI.&#8212;Argument. From the Prison They are Led Forth with Joy into the Amphitheatre, Especially Perpetua and Felicitas. All Refuse to Put on Profane Garments. They are Scourged, They are Thrown to the Wild Beasts. Saturus Twice is Unhurt. Perpetua and Felicitas are Thrown Down; They are Called Back to the Sanavivarian Gate. Saturus Wounded by a Leopard, Exhorts the Soldier.

<p class="c19"><a name="vi.vi.viii-p2"></A>1. The day of their victory shone forth, and they proceeded from the prison into the amphitheatre, as if to an assembly, joyous and of brilliant countenances; if perchance shrinking, it was with joy, and not with fear. Perpetua followed with placid look, and with step and gait as a matron of Christ, beloved of God; casting down the luster of her eyes from the gaze of all. Moreover, Felicitas, rejoicing that she had safely brought forth, so that she might fight with the wild beasts; from the blood and from the midwife to the gladiator, to wash after childbirth with a second baptism. And when they were brought to the gate, and were constrained to put on the clothing&#8212;the men, that of the priests of Saturn, and the women, that of those who were consecrated to Ceres&#8212;that noble-minded woman resisted even to the end with constancy. For she said, &#8220;We have come thus far of our own accord, for this reason, that our liberty might not be restrained. For this reason we have yielded our minds, that we might not do any such thing as this:&#160; we have agreed on this with you.&#8221;&#160; Injustice acknowledged the justice; the tribune yielded to their being brought as simply as they were. Perpetua sang psalms, already treading under foot the head of the Egyptian; Revocatus, and Saturninus, and Saturus uttered threatenings against the gazing people about this martyrdom. When they came within sight of Hilarianus, by gesture and nod, they began to say to Hilarianus, &#8220;Thou judgest us,&#8221; say they, &#8220;but God will judge thee.&#8221; At this the people, exasperated, demanded that they should be tormented with scourges as they passed along the rank of the <i>venatores</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9004"></A><A HREF="#fn_9004"><FONT SIZE="1">9005</FONT></A>
 And they indeed rejoiced that they should have incurred any one of their Lord&#146;s passions.</p> 
<p class="c20"><a name="vi.vi.viii-p4"></A>2. But He who had said, &#8220;Ask, and ye <A NAME="page_705"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 705</FONT></A> <a name="vi.vi.viii-Page_705"></A>shall receive,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9005"></A><A HREF="#fn_9005"><FONT SIZE="1">9006</FONT></A>
 gave to them when they asked, that death which each one had wished for. For when at any time they had been discoursing among themselves about their wish in respect of their martyrdom, Saturninus indeed had professed that he wished that he might be thrown to all the beasts; doubtless that he might wear a more glorious crown. Therefore in the beginning of the exhibition he and Revocatus made trial of the leopard, and moreover upon the scaffold they were harassed by the bear. Saturus, however, held nothing in greater abomination than a bear; but he imagined that he would be put an end to with one bite of a leopard. Therefore, when a wild boar was supplied, it was the huntsman rather who had supplied that boar who was gored by that same beast, and died the day after the shows.&#160; Saturus only was drawn out; and when he had been bound on the floor near to a bear, the bear would not come forth from his den. And so Saturus for the second time is recalled unhurt.</p> 
<p class="c20"><a name="vi.vi.viii-p6"></A>3. Moreover, for the young women the devil prepared a very fierce cow, provided especially for that purpose contrary to custom, rivalling their sex also in that of the beasts. And so, stripped and clothed with nets, they were led forth. The populace shuddered as they saw one young woman of delicate frame, and another with breasts still dropping from her recent childbirth. So, being recalled, they are unbound.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9006"></A><A HREF="#fn_9006"><FONT SIZE="1">9007</FONT></A>
 Perpetua is first led in. She was tossed, and fell on her loins; and when she saw her tunic torn from her side, she drew it over her as a veil for her middle, rather mindful of her modesty than her suffering. Then she was called for again, and bound up her dishevelled hair; for it was not becoming for a martyr to suffer with dishevelled hair, lest she should appear to be mourning in her glory. So she rose up; and when she saw Felicitas crushed, she approached and gave her her hand, and lifted her up. And both of them stood together; and the brutality of the populace being appeased, they were recalled to the Sanavivarian gate. Then Perpetua was received by a certain one who was still a catechumen, Rusticus by name, who kept close to her; and she, as if aroused from sleep, so deeply had she been in the Spirit and in an ecstasy, began to look round her, and to say to the amazement of all, &#8220;I cannot tell when we are to be led out to that cow.&#8221; And when she had heard what had already happened, she did not believe it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9007"></A><A HREF="#fn_9007"><FONT SIZE="1">9008</FONT></A>
 until she had perceived certain signs of injury in her body and in her dress, and had recognised the catechumen.&#160; Afterwards causing that catechumen and the brother to approach, she addressed them, saying, &#8220;Stand fast in the faith, and love one another, all of you, and be not offended at my sufferings.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c20"><a name="vi.vi.viii-p9"></A>4. The same Saturus at the other entrance exhorted the soldier Pudens, saying, &#8220;Assuredly here I am, as I have promised and foretold, for up to this moment I have felt no beast. And now believe with your whole heart. Lo, I am going forth to that beast, and I shall be destroyed with one bite of the leopard.&#8221; And immediately at the conclusion of the exhibition he was thrown to the leopard; and with one bite of his he was bathed with such a quantity of blood, that the people shouted out to him as he was returning, the testimony of his second baptism, &#8220;Saved and washed, saved and washed.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9008"></A><A HREF="#fn_9008"><FONT SIZE="1">9009</FONT></A>
 Manifestly he was assuredly saved who had been glorified in such a spectacle. Then to the soldier Pudens he said, &#8220;Farewell, and be mindful of my faith; and let not these things disturb, but confirm you.&#8221;&#160; And at the same time he asked for a little ring from his finger, and returned it to him bathed in his wound, leaving to him an inherited token and the memory of his blood. And then lifeless he is cast down with the rest, to be slaughtered in the usual place. And when the populace called for them into the midst, that as the sword penetrated into their body they might make their eyes partners in the murder, they rose up of their own accord, and transferred themselves whither the people wished; but they first kissed one another, that they might consummate their martyrdom with the kiss of peace. The rest indeed, immoveable and in silence, received the sword-thrust; much more Saturus, who also had first ascended the ladder, and first gave up his spirit, for he also was waiting for Perpetua. But Perpetua, that she might taste some pain, being pierced between the ribs, cried out loudly, and she herself placed the wavering right hand of the youthful gladiator to her throat.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9009"></A><A HREF="#fn_9009"><FONT SIZE="1">9010</FONT></A>
 Possibly such a woman could not have been slain unless she herself had willed it, because she was feared by the impure spirit.</p> 
<p class="c20"><a name="vi.vi.viii-p12"></A>O most brave and blessed martyrs! O truly called and chosen unto the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ! whom whoever magnifies, and honours, and adores, assuredly ought to read these examples for the edification of the Church, not less than the ancient ones, so that <A NAME="page_706"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 706</FONT></A> <a name="vi.vi.viii-Page_706"></A>new virtues also may testify that one and the same Holy Spirit is always operating even until now, and God the Father Omnipotent, and His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, whose is the glory and infinite power for ever and ever.&#160; Amen.</p>
