<span id="iv.iv.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—General Conclusion.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xxiv-p2"></span>Amid these reefs and inlets, amid these
shallows and straits of idolatry, Faith, her sails filled by the Spirit
of God, navigates; safe if cautious, secure if intently watchful. But to
such as are washed overboard is a deep whence is no out-swimming; to
such as are run aground is inextricable shipwreck; to such as are
engulphed is a whirlpool, where there is no breathing—even in idolatry.
All waves thereof whatsoever suffocate; every eddy thereof sucks down
unto Hades. Let no one say, “Who will so safely foreguard himself? We
shall have to go out of the world!” <span
id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341) As if it were not as well worth while
to go out, as to stand in the world as an idolater!  Nothing can be
easier than caution against idolatry, if the fear of it be our leading
fear; any “necessity” whatever <span id="page_76">p. 76</span> <span
id="iv.iv.xxiv-Page_76"></span>is too trifling compared to such a peril.
The reason why the Holy Spirit did, when the apostles at that time were
consulting, relax the bond and yoke for us, <span
id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342) was that we might be free to devote
ourselves to the shunning of idolatry. This shall be our Law, the more
fully to be administered the more ready it is to hand; (a Law) peculiar
to Christians, by means whereof we are recognised and examined by
heathens. This Law must be set before such as approach unto the Faith,
and inculcated on such as are entering it; that, in approaching, they
may deliberate; observing it, may persevere; not observing it, may
renounce their name. <span id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343) We will see
to it, if, after the type of the Ark, there shall be in the Church
raven, kite, dog, and serpent. At all events, an idolater is not found
in the type of the Ark: no animal has been fashioned to represent an
idolater. Let not that be in the Church which was not in the Ark. <span
