<span id="v.iv.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Isaiah’s Prophecies
Considered. The Virginity of Christ’s Mother a Sign. Other Prophecies
Also Signs. Metaphorical Sense of Proper Names in Sundry Passages of the
Prophets.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.xiii-p2"></span>You are equally led away by the sound
of names, <span id="fr_3255"></span>[3256](#fn_3255) when you so
understand the riches of Damascus, and the spoils of Samaria, and the
king of Assyria, as if they portended that the Creator’s Christ was a
warrior, not attending to the promise contained in the passage, “For
before the Child shall have knowledge to cry, My father and My mother,
He shall take away the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria
before the king of Assyria.” <span id="fr_3256"></span>[3257](#fn_3256)
You should first examine the point of age, whether it can be taken to
represent Christ as even yet a man, <span
id="fr_3257"></span>[3258](#fn_3257) much less a warrior. Although, to
be sure, He might be about to call to arms by His cry as an infant;
might be about to sound the alarm of war not with a trumpet, but with a
little rattle; might be about to seek His foe, not on horseback, or in
chariot, or from parapet, but from nurse’s neck or nursemaid’s back, and
so be destined to subjugate Damascus and Samaria from His mother’s
breasts!  It is a different matter, of course, when the babes of your
barbarian Pontus spring forth to the fight. They are, I ween, taught to
lance before they lacerate; <span id="fr_3258"></span>[3259](#fn_3258)
swathed at first in sunshine and ointment, <span
id="fr_3259"></span>[3260](#fn_3259) afterwards armed with the
satchel, <span id="fr_3260"></span>[3261](#fn_3260) and rationed on
bread and butter! <span id="fr_3261"></span>[3262](#fn_3261) Now, since
nature, certainly, nowhere grants to man to learn warfare before life,
to pillage the wealth of a Damascus before he knows his father and
mother’s name, it follows that the passage in question must be deemed to
be a figurative one. Well, but nature, says he, does not permit “a
virgin to conceive,” and still the prophet is believed. And indeed very
properly; for he has paved the way for the incredible thing being
believed, by giving a reason for its occurrence, in that it was to be
for a sign. “Therefore,” says he, “the Lord himself shall give you a
*sign*; behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son.” <span
id="fr_3262"></span>[3263](#fn_3262) Now a sign from God would not have
been a sign, <span id="fr_3263"></span>[3264](#fn_3263) unless it had
been some novel and prodigious thing. Then, again, Jewish cavillers, in
order to disconcert us, boldly pretend that Scripture does not
hold <span id="fr_3264"></span>[3265](#fn_3264) that a virgin, but only
a young woman, <span id="fr_3265"></span>[3266](#fn_3265) is to conceive
and bring <span id="page_332">p. 332</span> <span
id="v.iv.iv.xiii-Page_332"></span>forth.  They are, however, refuted by
this consideration, that nothing of the nature of *a sign* can possibly
come out of what is a daily occurrence, the pregnancy and child-bearing
of a young woman. A virgin mother is justly deemed to be proposed <span
id="fr_3266"></span>[3267](#fn_3266) by God as *a sign*, but a warlike
infant has no like claim to the distinction; for even in such a
case <span id="fr_3267"></span>[3268](#fn_3267) there does not occur the
character of a sign.  But after the sign of the strange and novel birth
has been asserted, there is immediately afterwards declared as a sign
the subsequent course of the Infant, <span
id="fr_3268"></span>[3269](#fn_3268) who was to eat butter and honey.
Not that this indeed is of the nature of a sign, nor is His “refusing
the evil;” for this, too, is only a characteristic of infancy. <span
id="fr_3269"></span>[3270](#fn_3269) But His destined capture of the
riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria before the king of Assyria
*is no doubt a wonderful sign*. <span
id="fr_3270"></span>[3271](#fn_3270) Keep to the measure of His age, and
seek the purport of the prophecy, and give back also to the truth of the
gospel what you have taken away from it in the lateness of your
heresy, <span id="fr_3271"></span>[3272](#fn_3271) and the prophecy at
once becomes intelligible and declares its own accomplishment. Let those
eastern magi wait on the new-born Christ, presenting to Him, (although)
in His infancy, their gifts of gold and frankincense; and surely an
Infant will have received the riches of Damascus without a battle, and
unarmed.

<span id="v.iv.iv.xiii-p20"></span>For besides the generally known fact,
that the riches of the East, that is to say, its strength and resources,
usually consist of gold and spices, it is certainly true of the Creator,
that He makes gold the riches of the other <span
id="fr_3272"></span>[3273](#fn_3272) nations also. Thus He says by
Zechariah: “And Judah shall also fight at Jerusalem and shall gather
together all the wealth of the nations round about, gold and
silver.” <span id="fr_3273"></span>[3274](#fn_3273) Moreover, respecting
that gift of gold, David also says: “And there shall be given to Him of
the gold of Arabia;” <span id="fr_3274"></span>[3275](#fn_3274) and
again: “The kings of Arabia and Saba shall offer to Him gifts.” <span
id="fr_3275"></span>[3276](#fn_3275) For the East generally regarded the
magi as kings; and Damascus was anciently deemed to belong to Arabia,
before it was transferred to Syrophœnicia on the division of the Syrias
(by Rome). <span id="fr_3276"></span>[3277](#fn_3276) Its riches Christ
then received, when He received the tokens thereof in the gold and
spices; while the spoils of Samaria were the magi themselves. These
having discovered Him and honoured Him with their gifts, and on bended
knee adored Him as their God and King, through the witness of the star
which led their way and guided them, became the spoils of Samaria, that
is to say, of idolatry, because, as it is easy enough to see, <span
id="fr_3277"></span>[3278](#fn_3277) they believed in Christ. He
designated idolatry under the name of Samaria, as that city was shameful
for its idolatry, through which it had then revolted from God from the
days of king Jeroboam. Nor is this an unusual manner for the Creator,
(in His Scriptures <span id="fr_3278"></span>[3279](#fn_3278) )
figuratively to employ names of places as a metaphor derived from the
analogy of their sins. Thus He calls the chief men of the Jews “rulers
of Sodom,” and the nation itself “people of Gomorrah.” <span
id="fr_3279"></span>[3280](#fn_3279) And in another passage He also
says: “Thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite,” <span
id="fr_3280"></span>[3281](#fn_3280) by reason of their kindred
iniquity; <span id="fr_3281"></span>[3282](#fn_3281) although He had
actually called them His sons:  “I have nourished and brought up
*children*.” <span id="fr_3282"></span>[3283](#fn_3282) So likewise by
Egypt is sometimes understood, in His sense, <span
id="fr_3283"></span>[3284](#fn_3283) the whole world as being marked out
by superstition and a curse. <span id="fr_3284"></span>[3285](#fn_3284)
By a similar usage Babylon also in our (St.) John is a figure of the
city of Rome, as being like (Babylon) great and proud in royal power,
and warring down the saints of God. Now it was in accordance with this
style that He called the magi by the name of Samaritans, because (as we
have said) they had practised idolatry as did the Samaritans.  Moreover,
by the phrase “before *or against* the king of Assyria,” understand
“against Herod;” against whom the magi then opposed themselves, when
they refrained from carrying him back word concerning Christ, whom he
was seeking to destroy.

Kimchi’s authority; while the neologian Gesenius interprets the word, *a
