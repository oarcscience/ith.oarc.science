<span id="v.v.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIII.—Other Discrepancies Exposed
and Refuted Respecting the Evil in Matter Being Changed to Good.</span>

<span id="v.v.xliii-p2"></span>On the subject of motion I would make
this further remark.  Following the *simile* of the boiling caldron, you
say that motion in Matter, before it was regulated, was confused, <span
id="fr_6581"></span>[6582](#fn_6581) restless, incomprehensible by
reason of excess in the commotion. <span
id="fr_6582"></span>[6583](#fn_6582) Then again you go on to say, “But
it waited for the regulation <span id="fr_6583"></span>[6584](#fn_6583)
of God, and kept its irregular motion incomprehensible, owing to the
tardiness of its irregular motion.” Just before you ascribe commotion,
here tardiness, to motion. Now observe how many slips you make
respecting the nature of Matter. In a former passage <span
id="fr_6584"></span>[6585](#fn_6584) you say, “If Matter were naturally
evil, it would not have admitted of a change for the better; nor would
God have ever applied to it any attempt at arrangement, for His labour
would have been in vain.” You therefore concluded your two opinions,
that Matter was not by nature evil, and that its nature was incapable of
being changed by God; and then, forgetting them, you afterwards drew
this inference: “But when it received adjustment from God, and was
reduced to order, <span id="fr_6585"></span>[6586](#fn_6585) it
relinquished its nature.” Now, inasmuch as it was transformed to good,
it was of course transformed from evil; and if by God’s setting it in
order it relinquished <span id="fr_6586"></span>[6587](#fn_6586) the
nature of evil, it follows that its nature came to an end; <span
id="fr_6587"></span>[6588](#fn_6587) now its nature was evil before the
adjustment, but after the transformation it might have relinquished that
nature.
