<span id="v.iv.ii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—The Marcionites Depreciate
the Creation, Which, However, is a Worthy Witness of God. This
Worthiness Illustrated by References to the Heathen Philosophers, Who
Were Apt to Invest the Several Parts of Creation with Divine
Attributes.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xiii-p2"></span>While we are expelling from this rank
(of Deity) a god who has no evidence to show for himself which is so
proper and God-worthy as the testimony of the Creator, Marcion’s most
shameless followers with haughty impertinence fall upon the Creator’s
works to destroy them. To be sure, say they, the world is a grand work,
worthy of a God. <span id="fr_2471"></span>[2472](#fn_2471) Then is the
Creator not at all a God? By all means He is God. <span
id="fr_2472"></span>[2473](#fn_2472) Therefore <span
id="fr_2473"></span>[2474](#fn_2473) the world is not unworthy of God,
for God has made nothing unworthy of Himself; although it was for man,
and not for Himself, that He made the world, (and) although every work
is less than its maker.  And yet, if to have been the author of our
creation, such as it is, be unworthy of God, how much more unworthy of
Him is it to have created absolutely nothing at all!—not even a
production which, although unworthy, might yet have encouraged the hope
of some better attempt.  To say somewhat, then, concerning the
alleged <span id="fr_2474"></span>[2475](#fn_2474) unworthiness of this
world’s fabric, to which among the Greeks also is assigned a name of
ornament and grace, <span id="fr_2475"></span>[2476](#fn_2475) not of
sordidness, those very professors of wisdom, <span
id="fr_2476"></span>[2477](#fn_2476) from whose genius every heresy
derives its spirit, <span id="fr_2477"></span>[2478](#fn_2477) called
the said unworthy elements divine; as Thales did water, Heraclitus fire,
Anaximenes air, Anaximander all the heavenly bodies, Strato the sky and
earth, Zeno the air and ether, and Plato the stars, which he calls a
fiery kind of gods; whilst concerning the world, when they considered
indeed its magnitude, and strength, and power, and honour, and
glory,—the abundance, too, the regularity, and law of those individual
elements which contribute to the production, the nourishment, the
ripening, and the reproduction of all things,—the majority of the
philosophers hesitated <span id="fr_2478"></span>[2479](#fn_2478) to
assign a beginning and an end to the said world, lest its constituent
elements, <span id="fr_2479"></span>[2480](#fn_2479) great as they
undoubtedly are, should fail to be regarded as divine, <span
id="fr_2480"></span>[2481](#fn_2480) which are objects of worship with
the Persian magi, the Egyptian hierophants, and the Indian
gymnosophists. The very superstition of the crowd, inspired by the
common idolatry, when ashamed of the names and fables of their ancient
dead borne by their idols, has recourse to the interpretation of natural
objects, and so with much ingenuity cloaks its own disgrace,
figuratively reducing Jupiter to a heated substance, and Juno to an
aërial one (according to the literal sense of the Greek words); <span
id="fr_2481"></span>[2482](#fn_2481) Vesta, in like manner, to fire, and
the Muses to waters, and the Great Mother <span
id="fr_2482"></span>[2483](#fn_2482) to the earth, mowed as to its
crops, ploughed up with lusty arms, and watered <span id="page_281">p.
281</span> <span id="v.iv.ii.xiii-Page_281"></span>with baths. <span
id="fr_2483"></span>[2484](#fn_2483) Thus Osiris also, whenever he is
buried, and looked for to come to life again, and with joy recovered, is
an emblem of the regularity wherewith the fruits of the ground return,
and the elements recover life, and the year comes round; as also the
lions of Mithras <span id="fr_2484"></span>[2485](#fn_2484) are
philosophical sacraments of arid and scorched nature. It is, indeed,
enough for me that natural elements, foremost in site and state, should
have been more readily regarded as divine than as unworthy of God. I
will, however, come down to <span id="fr_2485"></span>[2486](#fn_2485)
humbler objects. A single floweret from the hedgerow, I say not from the
meadows; a single little shellfish from any sea, I say not from the Red
Sea; a single stray wing of a moorfowl, I say nothing of the
peacock,—will, I presume, prove to you that the Creator was but a
sorry <span id="fr_2486"></span>[2487](#fn_2486) artificer!

<span id="v.iv.ii.xiii-p13"></span> The Greek name of Jupiter, <span

name, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xiii-p13.3"></span>῞Ηρα</span>, Tertullian connects with
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.ii.xiii-p13.4"></span>ἀήρ</span>, the
air; <span class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.ii.xiii-p13.5"></span>παρὰ τὸ
ἀὴρ καθ᾽ ὑπέρθεσιν ῞Ηρα</span>. These names of the two great deities
suggest a connection with fire and air.

<span id="v.iv.ii.xiii-p15"></span> The earth’s irrigations, and the
washings of the image of Cybele every year in the river Almo by her
priests, are here confusedly alluded to.  For references to the pagan
custom, see White and Riddle’s large *Lat. Dict. s. v.* <span

<span id="v.iv.ii.xiii-p16"></span> Mithras, the Persian sun-god, was
symbolized by the image of a lion.  The sun entering the zodiacal sign
*Leo* amidst summer heat may be glanced at.
