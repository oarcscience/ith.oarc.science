<span id="v.ix.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—The Paraclete, or Holy Ghost. He
is Distinct from the Father and the Son as to Their Personal Existence.
One and Inseparable from Them as to Their Divine Nature. Other
Quotations Out of St. John’s Gospel.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xxv-p2"></span>What follows Philip’s question, and *the
Lord’s* whole treatment of it, to the end of *John’s* Gospel, continues
to furnish us with statements of the same kind, distinguishing the
Father and the Son, with the properties of each. Then there is the
Paraclete *or Comforter*, also, which He promises to pray for to the
Father, and to send from heaven after He had ascended to the Father. *He
is called* “another Comforter,” indeed; <span
id="fr_8110"></span>[8111](#fn_8110) but in what way He is *another* we
have already shown, <span id="fr_8111"></span>[8112](#fn_8111) “He shall
receive of mine,” says Christ, <span
id="fr_8112"></span>[8113](#fn_8112) just as *Christ* Himself received
of the Father’s. Thus the connection of the Father in the Son, and of
the Son in the Paraclete, produces three coherent Persons, *who are yet
distinct* One from Another. These Three are one <span
id="fr_8113"></span>[8114](#fn_8113) *essence*, not one *Person*, <span
id="fr_8114"></span>[8115](#fn_8114) as it is said, “I and my Father are
One,” <span id="fr_8115"></span>[8116](#fn_8115) in respect of unity of
substance not singularity of number. Run through the whole *Gospel*, and
you will find that He whom you believe to be the Father (described as
acting for the Father, although you, for your part, forsooth, suppose
that “the Father, being the husbandman,” <span
id="fr_8116"></span>[8117](#fn_8116) must surely have been on earth) is
once more recognised by the Son as in heaven, when, “lifting up His eyes
thereto,” <span id="fr_8117"></span>[8118](#fn_8117) He commended His
disciples to the safe-keeping of the Father. <span
id="fr_8118"></span>[8119](#fn_8118) We have, moreover, in that other
Gospel a clear revelation, i.e. *of the Son’s distinction from the
Father*, “My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?” <span
id="fr_8119"></span>[8120](#fn_8119) and again, (in the third Gospel,)
“Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.” <span
id="fr_8120"></span>[8121](#fn_8120) But even if (we had not these
passages, we meet with satisfactory evidence) after His resurrection and
glorious victory over death. Now that all the restraint of His
humiliation is taken away, He might, if possible, have shown Himself as
the Father to so faithful a woman (as Mary Magdalene) when she
approached to touch Him, out of love, not from curiosity, nor with
Thomas’ incredulity. *But not so*; Jesus saith unto her, “Touch me not,
for I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren” (and even
in this He proves Himself to be the Son; for if He had been the Father,
He would have called them His *children*, (instead of His *brethren*),
“and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my
God and your God.” <span id="fr_8121"></span>[8122](#fn_8121) *Now, does
this mean, I ascend* as the Father to the Father, and as God to God? Or
as the Son to the Father, and as the Word to God? Wherefore also does
this Gospel, at its very termination, intimate that these things were
ever written, if it be not, to use its own words, “that ye might believe
that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?” <span
id="fr_8122"></span>[8123](#fn_8122) Whenever, therefore, you take any
of the statements of this Gospel, and apply them to demonstrate the
identity of the Father and the Son, supposing that they serve your views
therein, you are contending against the definite purpose of the Gospel.
For these things certainly are not written that you may believe that
Jesus Christ is the Father, but the Son. <span
