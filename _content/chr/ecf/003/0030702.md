<span id="v.xi.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.xi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Marcus and Colarbasus.</span>

<span id="v.xi.v-p2"></span>After these there were not wanting a Marcus
and a Colarbasus, composing a novel heresy out of the Greek alphabet.
For they affirm that without those letters truth cannot be found; nay
more, that in those letters the whole plenitude and perfection of truth
is comprised; for this was why Christ said, “I am the Alpha and the
Omega.” <span id="fr_8392"></span>[8393](#fn_8392) In fact, they say
that Jesus Christ descended, <span id="fr_8393"></span>[8394](#fn_8393)
that is, that *the dove* came down on Jesus; <span
id="fr_8394"></span>[8395](#fn_8394) and, since the dove is styled by
the Greek name <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xi.v-p5.2"></span>περιστερά</span> —(*peristera*), it has in
itself this number DCCCI. <span id="fr_8395"></span>[8396](#fn_8395)
These men run through their <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xi.v-p6.1"></span>Ω, Ψ, Χ, Φ, Υ, Τ</span>—through the whole
alphabet, indeed, up to <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xi.v-p6.2"></span>Α</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xi.v-p6.3"></span>Β</span>—and compute ogdoads and decads.  So we
may grant it useless and idle to recount all their trifles. What,
however, must be allowed not merely vain, but likewise dangerous, is
this:  they feign a second God, beside the Creator; they affirm that
Christ was not in the substance of flesh; they say there is to be no
resurrection of the flesh.

<span id="v.xi.v-p4"></span> Denique Jesum Christum descendisse. So
Oehler, who does not notice any conjectural emendation, or various
reading, of the words. If correct, his reading would refer to the views
of a twofold Jesus Christ—a real and a phantasmal one—held by docetic
Gnostics, or to such views as Valentine’s, in whose system, so far as it
is ascertainable from the confused and discrepant account of it, there
would appear to have been one Æon called Christ, another called Jesus,
and a human person called Jesus and Christ, with whom the true Jesus
associated Himself. Some such jumble of ideas the two heretics now under
review would seem to have held, if Oehler’s be the true reading. But the
difficulties are somewhat lessened if we accept the very simple
emendation which naturally suggests itself, and which, I see, Semler has
proposed and Routh inclines to receive, “*in* Jesum Christum
descendisse,” i.e. “that Christ descended *on* Jesus.”

<span id="v.xi.v-p6"></span> Habere *secum* numerum DCCCI. So Oehler,
after Jos. Scaliger, who, however, seems to have read “*secum hunc*
numerum,” for the ordinary reading, “habere *secundum* numerum,” which
would mean, “represents, *in the way of* numerical value, DCCCI.”
