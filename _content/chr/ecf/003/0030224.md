<span id="iv.xi.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—The Soul, as to Its Nature
Uniform, But Its Faculties Variously Developed. Varieties Only
Accidental.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xx-p2"></span>And here, therefore, we draw our
conclusion, that all the natural properties of the soul are inherent in
it as parts of its substance; and that they grow and develope along with
it, from the very moment of its own origin at birth.  Just as Seneca
says, whom we so often find on our side: <span
id="fr_1644"></span>[1645](#fn_1644) “There are implanted within us the
seeds of all the arts and periods of life. And God, our Master, secretly
produces our mental dispositions;” that is, from the germs which are
implanted and hidden in us by means of infancy, and these are the
intellect: for from these our natural dispositions are <span
id="page_201">p. 201</span> <span
id="iv.xi.xx-Page_201"></span>evolved.  Now, even the seeds of plants
have, one form in each kind, but their development varies: some open and
expand in a healthy and perfect state, while others either improve or
degenerate, owing to the conditions of weather and soil, and from the
appliance of labour and care; also from the course of the seasons, and
from the occurrence of casual circumstances. In like manner, the soul
may well be <span id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645) uniform in its
seminal origin, although multiform by the process of nativity. <span
id="fr_1646"></span>[1647](#fn_1646) And here local influences, too,
must be taken into account. It has been said that dull and brutish
persons are born at Thebes; and the most accomplished in wisdom and
speech at Athens, where in the district of Colythus <span
id="fr_1647"></span>[1648](#fn_1647) children speak—such is the
precocity of their tongue—before they are a month old. Indeed, Plato
himself tells us, in the *Timæus*, that Minerva, when preparing to found
her great city, only regarded the nature of the country which gave
promise of mental dispositions of this kind; whence he himself in *The
Laws* instructs Megillus and Clinias to be careful in their selection of
a site for building a city. Empedocles, however, places the cause of a
subtle or an obtuse intellect in the quality of the blood, from which he
derives progress and perfection in learning and science. The subject of
national peculiarities has grown by this time into proverbial
notoriety.  Comic poets deride the Phrygians for their cowardice;
Sallust reproaches the Moors for their levity, and the Dalmatians for
their cruelty; even the apostle brands the Cretans as “liars.” <span
id="fr_1648"></span>[1649](#fn_1648) Very likely, too, something must be
set down to the score of bodily condition and the state of the health.
Stoutness hinders knowledge, but a spare form stimulates it; paralysis
prostrates the mind, a decline preserves it. How much more will those
accidental circumstances have to be noticed, which, in addition to the
state of one’s body or one’s health, tend to sharpen or to dull the
intellect! It is sharpened by learned pursuits, by the sciences, the
arts, by experimental knowledge, business habits, and studies; it is
blunted by ignorance, idle habits, inactivity, lust, inexperience,
listlessness, and vicious pursuits.  Then, besides these influences,
there must perhaps <span id="fr_1649"></span>[1650](#fn_1649) be added
the supreme powers. Now these are the supreme powers: according to our
(Christian) notions, they are the Lord God and His adversary the devil;
but according to men’s general opinion about providence, they are fate
and necessity; and about fortune, it is man’s freedom of will.  Even the
philosophers allow these distinctions; whilst on our part we have
already undertaken to treat of them, on the principles of the
(Christian) faith, in a separate work. <span
id="fr_1650"></span>[1651](#fn_1650) It is evident how great must be the
influences which so variously affect the one nature of the soul, since
they are commonly regarded as separate “*natures*.” Still they are not
different species, but casual incidents of one nature and substance—even
of that which God conferred on Adam, and made the mould of all
(subsequent ones). Casual incidents will they always remain, but never
will they become specific differences.  However great, too, at present
is the variety of men’s maunders, it was not so in Adam, the founder of
their race.  But all these discordances ought to have existed in him as
the fountainhead, and thence to have descended to us in an unimpaired
variety, if the variety had been due to nature.
