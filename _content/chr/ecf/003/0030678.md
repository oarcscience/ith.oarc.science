<span id="v.ix.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—Retrograde Character of the
Heresy of Praxeas. The Doctrine of the Blessed Trinity Constitutes the
Great Difference Between Judaism and Christianity.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xxxi-p2"></span>But, (this doctrine of yours bears a
likeness) to the Jewish faith, of which this is the substance—so to
believe in One God as to refuse to reckon the Son besides Him, and after
the Son the Spirit. Now, what difference would there be between us and
them, if there were not this distinction *which you are for breaking
down*? What need would there be of the gospel, which is the substance of
the New Covenant, laying down (as it does) that the Law and the Prophets
lasted until John *the Baptist*, if thenceforward the Father, the Son,
and the Spirit are not both believed in as Three, and as making One Only
God? God was pleased to renew His covenant with man in such a way as
that His Unity might be believed in, after a new manner, through the Son
and the Spirit, in order that God might now be known openly, <span
id="fr_8199"></span>[8200](#fn_8199) in His proper Names and Persons,
who in ancient times was not plainly understood, though declared through
the Son and the Spirit. Away, then, with <span
id="fr_8200"></span>[8201](#fn_8200) those “Antichrists who deny the
Father and the Son.” For they deny the Father, when they say that He is
the same as the Son; and they deny the Son, when they suppose Him to be
the same as the Father, by assigning to Them things which are not
*Theirs*, and taking away from Them things which are *Theirs*. But
“whosoever shall confess that (Jesus) Christ is the Son of God” (not the
Father), “God dwelleth in him, and he in God.” <span
id="fr_8201"></span>[8202](#fn_8201) We believe not the testimony of God
in which He testifies to us of His Son. “He that hath not the Son, hath
not life.” <span id="fr_8202"></span>[8203](#fn_8202) And that man has
not the Son, who believes Him to be any other than the Son.
