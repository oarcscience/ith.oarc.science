<span id="v.v.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—A Presumption that All Things
Were Created by God Out of Nothing Afforded by the Ultimate Reduction of
All Things to Nothing.  Scriptures Proving This Reduction Vindicated
from Hermogenes’ Charge of Being Merely Figurative.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxxiv-p2"></span>Besides, <span
id="fr_6488"></span>[6489](#fn_6488) the belief that everything was made
from nothing will be impressed upon us by that ultimate dispensation of
God which will bring back all things to nothing. For “the very heaven
shall be rolled together as a scroll;” <span
id="fr_6489"></span>[6490](#fn_6489) nay, it shall come to nothing along
with the earth itself, with which it was made in the beginning. “Heaven
and earth shall pass away,” <span id="fr_6490"></span>[6491](#fn_6490)
says He. “The first heaven and the first earth passed away,” <span
id="fr_6491"></span>[6492](#fn_6491) “and there was found no place for
them,” <span id="fr_6492"></span>[6493](#fn_6492) because, of course,
that which comes to an <span id="page_497">p. 497</span> <span
id="v.v.xxxiv-Page_497"></span>end loses locality. In like manner David
says, “The heavens, the works of Thine hands, shall themselves perish. 
For even as a vesture shall He change them, and they shall be
changed.” <span id="fr_6493"></span>[6494](#fn_6493) Now to be changed
is to fall from that primitive state which they lose whilst undergoing
the change. “And the stars too shall fall from heaven, even as a
fig-tree casteth her green figs <span
id="fr_6494"></span>[6495](#fn_6494) when she is shaken of a mighty
wind.” <span id="fr_6495"></span>[6496](#fn_6495) “The mountains shall
melt like wax at the presence of the Lord;” <span
id="fr_6496"></span>[6497](#fn_6496) that is, “when He riseth to shake
terribly the earth.” <span id="fr_6497"></span>[6498](#fn_6497) “But I
will dry up the pools;” <span id="fr_6498"></span>[6499](#fn_6498) and
“they shall seek water, and they shall find none.” <span
id="fr_6499"></span>[6500](#fn_6499) Even “the sea shall be no
more.” <span id="fr_6500"></span>[6501](#fn_6500) Now if any person
should go so far as to suppose that all these passages ought to be
spiritually interpreted, he will yet be unable to deprive them of the
true accomplishment of those issues which must come to pass just as they
have been written. For all figures of speech necessarily arise out of
real things, not out of chimerical ones; because nothing is capable of
imparting anything of its own for a similitude, except it actually be
that very thing which it imparts in the similitude. I return therefore
to the principle <span id="fr_6501"></span>[6502](#fn_6501) which
defines that all things which have come from nothing shall return at
last to nothing. For God would not have made any perishable thing out of
what was eternal, that is to say, out of Matter; neither out of greater
things would He have created inferior ones, to whose character it would
be more agreeable to produce greater things out of inferior ones,—in
other words, what is eternal out of what is perishable. This is the
promise He makes even to our flesh, and it has been His will to deposit
within us this pledge of His own virtue and power, in order that we may
believe that He has actually <span id="fr_6502"></span>[6503](#fn_6502)
awakened the universe out of nothing, as if it had been steeped in
death, <span id="fr_6503"></span>[6504](#fn_6503) in the sense, of
course, of its previous non-existence for the purpose of its coming into
existence. <span id="fr_6504"></span>[6505](#fn_6504)
