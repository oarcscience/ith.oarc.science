<span id="v.v.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Another Ground of Hermogenes
that Matter Has Some Good in It.  Its Absurdity.</span>

<span id="v.v.xiii-p2"></span>Here the question will arise How creatures
were made good out of it, <span id="fr_6256"></span>[6257](#fn_6256)
which were formed without any change at all? <span
id="fr_6257"></span>[6258](#fn_6257) How occurs the seed of what is
good, nay, very good, in that which is evil, nay, very evil? Surely a
good tree does not produce evil fruit, <span
id="fr_6258"></span>[6259](#fn_6258) since there is no God who is not
good; nor does an evil tree yield good fruit, since there is not Matter
except what is very evil. Or if we were to grant him that there is some
germ of good *in it*, then there will be no longer a uniform nature
(pervading it), that is to say, one which is evil throughout; but
instead thereof (we now encounter) a double nature, partly good and
partly evil; and again the question will arise, whether, in a subject
which is good and evil, there could possibly have been found a harmony
for light and darkness, for sweet and bitter? So again, if qualities so
utterly diverse as good and evil have been able to unite together, <span
id="fr_6259"></span>[6260](#fn_6259) and have imparted to Matter a
double nature, productive of both kinds of fruit, then no longer will
absolutely <span id="fr_6260"></span>[6261](#fn_6260) good things be
imputable to God, just as evil things are not ascribed to Him, but both
qualities will appertain to Matter, since they are derived from the
property of Matter. At this rate, we shall owe to God neither gratitude
for good things, nor grudge <span id="fr_6261"></span>[6262](#fn_6261)
for evil ones, because He has produced no work of His own proper
character. <span id="fr_6262"></span>[6263](#fn_6262) From which
circumstance will arise the clear proof that He has been subservient to
Matter.
