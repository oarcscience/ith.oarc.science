 at some <i>previously cherished</i> worse sentiment: that kind of men <i>I mean</i> which even we ourselves were in days gone by&#8212;blind, without the Lord&#146;s light.&#160; From the <i>reason</i> of repentance, however, they are just as far as they are from the Author of reason Himself. <i>Reason</i>, in fact, is a thing of God, inasmuch as there is nothing which God the Maker of all has not provided, disposed, ordained <i>by reason</i>&#8212;nothing which He has not willed should be handled and understood <i>by reason</i>. All, therefore, who are ignorant of God, must necessarily be ignorant also of a thing which is His, because no treasure-house&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8421"></A><A HREF="#fn_8421"><FONT SIZE="1">8422</FONT></A>
 at all is accessible to strangers. And thus, voyaging all the universal course of life without the rudder of reason, they know not how to shun the hurricane which is impending over the world.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8422"></A><A HREF="#fn_8422"><FONT SIZE="1">8423</FONT></A>
 Moreover, how irrationally they behave in the practice of repentance, it will be enough briefly to show just by this one fact, that they exercise it even in the case of their <i>good</i> deeds. They repent of good faith, of love, of simple-heartedness, of patience, of mercy, just in proportion as any deed <i>prompted by these feelings</i> has fallen on thankless soil.&#160; They execrate their own selves for having done good; and that species chiefly of repentance which is applied to the best works they fix in their heart, making it their care to remember never again to do a good turn. On repentance for <i>evil</i> deeds, on the contrary, they lay lighter stress. In short, they make this same (virtue) a means of <i>sinning</i> more readily than a means of <i>right-doing</i>.</p>
