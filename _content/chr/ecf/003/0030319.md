<span id="v.iv.ii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—The Dual Principle Falls to the
Ground; Plurality of Gods, of Whatever Number, More Consistent.
Absurdity and Injury to Piety Resulting from Marcion’s Duality.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.v-p2"></span>But on what principle did Marcion confine
his supreme powers to *two*? I would first ask, If there be two, why not
more? Because if *number* be compatible with the substance of Deity, the
richer you make it in number the better. Valentinus was more consistent
and more liberal; for he, having once imagined two deities, Bythos and
Sige, <span id="fr_2380"></span>[2381](#fn_2380) poured forth a swarm of
divine essences, a brood of no less than thirty Æons, like the sow of
Æneas. <span id="fr_2381"></span>[2382](#fn_2381) Now, whatever
principle refuses to admit several supreme beings, the same must reject
even two, for there is plurality in the very lowest number after one. 
After unity, *number* commences. So, again, the same principle which
could admit two could admit more.  After two, *multitude* begins, now
that one is exceeded. In short, we feel that reason herself
expressly <span id="fr_2382"></span>[2383](#fn_2382) forbids the belief
in more gods than one, because the self-same rule lays down one God and
not two, which declares that God must be a Being to which, as the great
Supreme, nothing is equal; and that Being to which nothing is equal
must, moreover, be unique. But further, what can be the use or advantage
in supposing two supreme beings, two co-ordinate <span
id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383) powers? What numerical difference
could there be when two equals differ not from one?  For that thing
which is the same in two is one. Even if there were several equals, all
would be just as much one, because, as equals, they would not differ one
from another. So, if of two beings neither differs from the other, since
both of them are on the supposition <span
id="fr_2384"></span>[2385](#fn_2384) supreme, both being gods, neither
of them is more excellent than the other; and so, having no
pre-eminence, their numerical distinction <span
id="fr_2385"></span>[2386](#fn_2385) has no reason in it. Number,
moreover, in the Deity ought to be consistent with the highest reason,
or else His worship would be brought into doubt. For consider <span
id="fr_2386"></span>[2387](#fn_2386) now, if, when I saw two Gods before
me (who, being both Supreme Beings, were equal to each other), I were to
worship them both, what should I be doing? I should be much afraid that
the abundance of my homage would be deemed superstition rather than
piety. Because, as both of them are so equal and are both included in
either of the <span id="page_275">p. 275</span> <span
id="v.iv.ii.v-Page_275"></span>two, I might serve them both acceptably
in only one; and by this very means I should attest their equality and
unity, provided that I worshipped them mutually the one in the other,
because in the one both are *present* to me. If I were to worship one of
the two, I should be equally conscious of seeming to pour contempt on
the uselessness of a numerical distinction, which was superfluous,
because it indicated no difference; in other words, I should think it
the safer course to worship neither of these two Gods than one of them
with some scruple of conscience, or both of them to none effect.
