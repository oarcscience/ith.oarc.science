<span id="v.iv.iii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—If, After Man’s Sin, God
Exercised His Attribute of Justice and Judgment, This Was Compatible
with His Goodness, and Enhances the True Idea of the Perfection of God’s
Character.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.xi-p2"></span>Up to the fall of man, therefore, from
the beginning God was simply good; after that He became a judge both
severe and, as the Marcionites will have it, cruel. Woman is at once
condemned to bring forth in sorrow, and to serve her husband, <span
id="fr_2843"></span>[2844](#fn_2843) although before she had heard
without pain the increase of her race proclaimed with the blessing,
*Increase and multiply*, and although she had been destined to be a help
and not a slave to her male partner. Immediately the earth is also
cursed, <span id="fr_2844"></span>[2845](#fn_2844) which before was
blessed. Immediately spring up briers and thorns, where once had grown
grass, and herbs, and fruitful trees. Immediately arise sweat and labour
for bread, where previously on every tree was yielded spontaneous food
and untilled <span id="fr_2845"></span>[2846](#fn_2845) nourishment.
Thenceforth it is “man *to* the ground,” and not as before, “*from* the
ground”; *to death* thenceforth, but before, *to life*; thenceforth with
coats of skins, but before, nakedness without a blush. Thus God’s prior
goodness was from <span id="fr_2846"></span>[2847](#fn_2846) nature, His
subsequent severity from <span id="fr_2847"></span>[2848](#fn_2847) a
cause. The one was innate, the other accidental; the one His own, the
other adapted; <span id="fr_2848"></span>[2849](#fn_2848) the one
issuing from Him, the other admitted by Him. But then *nature* could not
have rightly permitted His goodness to have gone on inoperative, nor the
*cause* have allowed His severity to have escaped in disguise or
concealment.  God provided the one for Himself, the other for the
occasion. <span id="fr_2849"></span>[2850](#fn_2849) You should now set
about showing also that the position of a judge is allied with evil, who
have been dreaming of another god as a purely good one—solely because
you cannot *understand the Deity to be* a judge; although we have proved
God to be also a judge. Or if not a judge, at any rate a perverse and
useless originator of a discipline which is not to be vindicated—in
other words, not to be judged.  You do not, however, disprove God’s
being a judge, who have no proof to show that He is a judge. You will
undoubtedly have to accuse justice herself, which provides the judge, or
else to reckon her among the species <span id="page_307">p. 307</span>
<span id="v.iv.iii.xi-Page_307"></span>of evil, that is, to add
injustice to the titles of goodness. But then justice is an evil, if
injustice is a good. And yet you are forced to declare injustice to be
one of the worst of things, and by the same rule are constrained to
class justice amongst the most excellent. Since there is nothing
hostile <span id="fr_2850"></span>[2851](#fn_2850) to evil which is not
good, and no enemy of good which is not evil. It follows, then, that as
injustice is an evil, so in the same degree is justice a good.  Nor
should it be regarded as simply a species of goodness, but as the
practical observance <span id="fr_2851"></span>[2852](#fn_2851) of it,
because goodness (unless justice be so controlled as to be just) will
not be goodness, if it be unjust. For nothing is good which is unjust;
while everything, on the other hand, which is just is good.
