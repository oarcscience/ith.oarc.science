<span id="v.xi.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.xi.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Cerdo, Marcion, Lucan,
Apelles.</span>

<span id="v.xi.vi-p2"></span>To this is added one Cerdo. He introduces
two first causes, <span id="fr_8396"></span>[8397](#fn_8396) that is,
two Gods—one good, the other cruel: <span
id="fr_8397"></span>[8398](#fn_8397) the good being the superior; the
latter, the cruel one, being the creator of the world. <span
id="fr_8398"></span>[8399](#fn_8398) He repudiates the prophecies and
the Law; renounces God the Creator; maintains that Christ who came was
the Son of the superior God; affirms that He was not in the substance of
flesh; states Him to have been only in a phantasmal shape, to have not
really suffered, but undergone a quasipassion, and not to have been born
of a virgin, *nay*, really not to have been born at all. A resurrection
of the soul merely does he approve, denying that of the body.  The
Gospel of Luke alone, and that not entire, does he receive. Of the
Apostle Paul he takes neither all the epistles, nor in their integrity.
The Acts of the Apostles and the Apocalypse he rejects as false.

<span id="v.xi.vi-p6"></span>After him emerged a disciple of his, one
Marcion by name, a native of Pontus, <span
id="fr_8399"></span>[8400](#fn_8399) son of a bishop, excommunicated
because of a rape committed on a certain virgin. <span
id="fr_8400"></span>[8401](#fn_8400) He, starting from the fact that it
is said, “Every good tree beareth good fruit, but an evil evil,” <span
id="fr_8401"></span>[8402](#fn_8401) attempted to approve the heresy of
Cerdo; so that his assertions are identical with those of the former
heretic before him.

<span id="v.xi.vi-p10"></span>After him arose one Lucan by name, a
follower and disciple of Marcion. He, too, wading through the same kinds
of blasphemy, teaches the same as Marcion and Cerdo had taught.

<span id="v.xi.vi-p11"></span>Close on their heels follows Apelles, a
disciple of Marcion, who after lapsing, into his own carnality, <span
id="fr_8402"></span>[8403](#fn_8402) was severed from Marcion. He
introduces one God in the infinite upper regions, and states that He
made many powers and angels; beside Him, withal, another Virtue, which
he affirms to be called Lord, but represents as an angel. By him he will
have it appear that the world <span id="fr_8403"></span>[8404](#fn_8403)
was originated in imitation of a superior world. <span
id="fr_8404"></span>[8405](#fn_8404) With this *lower* world he mingled
throughout (a principle of) repentance, because he had not made it so
perfectly as that superior world had been originated. The Law and the
prophets he repudiates. Christ he neither, like Marcion, affirms to have
been in a phantasmal shape, nor yet in substance of a true body, as the
Gospel teaches; but says, because He descended from the upper regions,
that in the course of His descent He wove together for Himself a starry
and airy <span id="fr_8405"></span>[8406](#fn_8405) flesh; and, in His
resurrection, restored, in the course of His ascent, to the several
individual elements whatever had been borrowed in His descent: and
thus—the several parts of His body dispersed—He reinstated in heaven His
spirit only. This man denies the resurrection of the flesh. He uses,
too, one only apostle; but that is Marcion’s, that is, a mutilated one.
He teaches the salvation of souls alone. <span id="page_654">p.
654</span> <span id="v.xi.vi-Page_654"></span>He has, besides, private
but extraordinary lections of his own, which he calls
“Manifestations” <span id="fr_8406"></span>[8407](#fn_8406) of one
Philumene, <span id="fr_8407"></span>[8408](#fn_8407) a girl whom he
follows as a prophetess.  He has, besides, his own books, which he has
entitled *books* of Syllogisms, in which he seeks to prove that whatever
Moses has written about God is not true, but is false.
