<span id="v.x.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.x.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.</span>

<span id="v.x.xiii-p2"></span>But how Paul, an apostle, from being a
persecutor, who first of all shed the blood of the church, though
afterwards he exchanged the sword for the pen, and turned the dagger
into a plough, being *first* a ravening wolf of Benjamin, then himself
supplying food as did Jacob, <span id="fr_8305"></span>[8306](#fn_8305)
—how he, (I say,) speaks in favour of martyrdoms, now to be chosen by
himself also, when, rejoicing over the Thessalonians, he says, “So that
we glory in you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith in
all your persecutions and tribulations, in which ye endure a
manifestation of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be accounted
worthy of His kingdom, for which ye also suffer!” <span
id="fr_8306"></span>[8307](#fn_8306) As also in his Epistle to the
Romans: “And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also, being sure
that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and
experience hope; and hope maketh not ashamed.” <span
id="fr_8307"></span>[8308](#fn_8307) And again:  “And if children, then
heirs, heirs indeed of God, and joint-heirs with Christ: if so be that
we suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified together.  For I
reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared
with the glory which shall be revealed in us.” <span
id="fr_8308"></span>[8309](#fn_8308) And therefore he afterward says:
“Who shall separate us from the love of God? Shall <span
id="page_647">p. 647</span> <span
id="v.x.xiii-Page_647"></span>tribulation, or distress, or famine, or
nakedness, or peril, or sword?  (As it is written: For Thy sake we are
killed all the day long; we have been counted as sheep for the
slaughter.) Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors,
through Him who loved us.  For we are persuaded, that neither death, nor
life, nor power, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be
able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
Lord.” <span id="fr_8309"></span>[8310](#fn_8309) But further, in
recounting his own sufferings to the Corinthians, he certainly decided
that suffering must be borne: “In labours, (he says,) more abundant, in
prisons very frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I
forty stripes, save one; thrice was I beaten with rods; once was I
stoned,” <span id="fr_8310"></span>[8311](#fn_8310) and the rest. And if
these severities will seem to be more grievous than martyrdoms, yet once
more he says: “Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches,
in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake.” <span
id="fr_8311"></span>[8312](#fn_8311) He also says, in verses occurring
in a previous part of the epistle: “Our condition is such, that we are
troubled on every side, yet not distressed; and are in need, but not in
utter want; since we are harassed by persecutions, but not forsaken; it
is such that we are cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about
in our body the dying of Christ.” <span
id="fr_8312"></span>[8313](#fn_8312) “But though,” says he, “our outward
man perisheth”—the flesh doubtless, by the violence of persecutions—“yet
the inward man is renewed day by day”—the soul, doubtless, by hope in
the promises. “For our light affliction, which is but for a moment,
worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while
we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are
not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal”—he is speaking of
troubles; “but the things which are not seen are eternal”—he is
promising rewards. But writing in bonds to the Thessalonians, <span
id="fr_8313"></span>[8314](#fn_8313) he certainly affirmed that they
were blessed, since to them it had been given not only to believe on
Christ, but also to suffer for His sake. “Having,” says he, “the same
conflict which ye both saw in me, and now hear to be in me.” <span
id="fr_8314"></span>[8315](#fn_8314) “For though I am offered upon the
sacrifice, I joy and rejoice with you all; in like manner do ye also joy
and rejoice with me.” You see what he decides the bliss of martyrdom to
be, in honour of which he is providing a festival of mutual joy. When at
length he had come to be very near the attainment of his desire, greatly
rejoicing in what he saw before him, he writes in these terms to
Timothy:  “For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure
is at hand. I have fought the good fight, I have finished my course, I
have kept the faith; there is laid up for me the crown which the Lord
will give me on that day” <span id="fr_8315"></span>[8316](#fn_8315)
—doubtless of his suffering. Admonition enough did he for his part also
give in preceding passages: “It is a faithful saying: For if we are dead
with Christ, we shall also live with Him; if we suffer, we shall also
reign with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us; if we believe not,
yet He is faithful: He cannot deny Himself.” <span
id="fr_8316"></span>[8317](#fn_8316) “Be not thou, therefore, ashamed of
the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner;” <span
id="fr_8317"></span>[8318](#fn_8317) for he had said before: “For God
hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of
a sound mind.” <span id="fr_8318"></span>[8319](#fn_8318) For we suffer
with power from love toward God, and with a sound mind, when we suffer
for our blamelessness. But further, if He anywhere enjoins endurance,
for what more than for sufferings is He providing it? If anywhere He
tears men away from idolatry, what more than martyrdoms takes the lead,
in tearing them away to its injury?
