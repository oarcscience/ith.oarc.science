id="iv.v.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.</span>

<span id="iv.v.xxvii-p2"></span>We ought to detest these heathen
meetings and assemblies, if on no other account than that there God’s
name is blasphemed—that there the cry “To the lions!” is daily raised
against us <span id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372) —that from thence
persecuting decrees are wont to emanate, and temptations are sent forth.
What will you do if you are caught in that heaving tide of impious
judgments? Not that there any harm is likely to come to you from men:
nobody knows that you are a Christian; but think how it fares with you
in heaven. For at the very time the devil is working havoc in the
church, do you doubt that the angels are looking down from above, and
marking every man, who speaks and who listens to the blaspheming word,
who lends his tongue and who lends his ears to the service of Satan
against God? Shall you not then shun those tiers where the enemies of
Christ assemble, that seat of all that is pestilential, and the very
super incumbent atmosphere all impure with wicked cries? Grant that you
have there things that are pleasant, things both agreeable and innocent
in themselves; even some things that are excellent. Nobody dilutes
poison with gall and hellebore: the accursed thing is put into
condiments well seasoned and of sweetest taste. So, too, the devil puts
into the deadly draught which he prepares, things of God most pleasant
and most acceptable. Everything there, then, that is either brave,
noble, loud-sounding, melodious, or exquisite in taste, hold it but as
the honey drop of a poisoned cake; nor make so much of your taste for
its pleasures, as of the danger you run from its attractions.
