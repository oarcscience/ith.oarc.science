<span id="vi.iv.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Of Time for Prayer.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxv-p2"></span>Touching the *time*, however, the
extrinsic <span id="fr_8923"></span>[8924](#fn_8923) observance of
certain hours will not be unprofitable—those common hours, I mean, which
mark the intervals of the day—the third, the sixth, the ninth—which we
<span id="page_690">p. 690</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxv-Page_690"></span>may find in the Scriptures to have been
more solemn than the rest. The first infusion of the Holy Spirit into
the congregated disciples took place at “the third hour.” <span
id="fr_8924"></span>[8925](#fn_8924) Peter, on the day on which he
experienced the vision of Universal Community, <span
id="fr_8925"></span>[8926](#fn_8925) (exhibited) in that small
vessel, <span id="fr_8926"></span>[8927](#fn_8926) had ascended into the
more lofty parts *of the house*, for prayer’s sake “at the sixth
hour.” <span id="fr_8927"></span>[8928](#fn_8927) The same (apostle) was
going into the temple, with John, “at the ninth *hour*,” <span
id="fr_8928"></span>[8929](#fn_8928) when he restored the paralytic to
his health.  Albeit these *practices* stand simply without any *precept*
for their observance, still it may be granted a good thing to establish
some definite presumption, which may both add stringency to the
admonition to pray, and may, as it were by a law, tear us out from our
businesses unto such a duty; so that—what we read to have been observed
by Daniel also, <span id="fr_8929"></span>[8930](#fn_8929) in accordance
(of course) with Israel’s discipline—we pray at least not less than
thrice in the day, debtors as we are to Three—Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit: of course, in addition to our regular prayers which are due,
without any admonition, on the entrance of light and of night. But,
withal, it becomes believers not to take food, and not to go to the
bath, before interposing a prayer; for the refreshments and nourishments
of the spirit are to be held prior to those of the flesh, and things
heavenly prior to things earthly.

<span id="vi.iv.xxv-p3"></span> Mr. Dodgson supposes this word to mean
“outward, as contrasted with the inward, ‘praying always.’” Oehler
interprets, “ex vita communi.” But perhaps what Tertullian says lower
down in the chapter, “albeit they stand *simply without any precept
enjoining their observance*,” may give us the true clue to his meaning;
so that “extrinsecus” would ="extrinsic to any direct injunction of our
Lord or His apostles.”
