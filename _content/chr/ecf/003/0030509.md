<span id="v.v.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL.—Shapeless Matter an Incongruous
Origin for God’s Beautiful Cosmos. Hermogenes Does Not Mend His Argument
by Supposing that Only a Portion of Matter Was Used in the
Creation.</span>

<span id="v.v.xl-p2"></span>You say that Matter was reformed for the
better <span id="fr_6555"></span>[6556](#fn_6555) —from a worse
condition, of course; and *thus* you would make the better a copy of
<span id="page_500">p. 500</span> <span id="v.v.xl-Page_500"></span>the
worse. Everything was in confusion, but now it is reduced to order; and
would you also say, that out of order, disorder is produced? No one
thing is the exact mirror <span id="fr_6556"></span>[6557](#fn_6556) of
another thing; that is to say, it is not its co-equal. Nobody ever found
himself in a barber’s looking-glass look like an ass <span
id="fr_6557"></span>[6558](#fn_6557) instead of a man; unless it be he
who supposes that unformed and shapeless Matter answers to Matter which
is now arranged and beautified in the fabric of the world. What is there
now that is without form in the world, what was there once that was
formed <span id="fr_6558"></span>[6559](#fn_6558) in Matter, that the
world is the mirror of Matter? Since the world is known among the Greeks
by a term denoting *ornament*, <span
id="fr_6559"></span>[6560](#fn_6559) how can it present the image of
unadorned <span id="fr_6560"></span>[6561](#fn_6560) Matter, in such a
way that you can say the whole is known by its parts? To that whole will
certainly belong even the *portion* which has not yet become formed; and
you have already declared that the whole *of Matter* was not used as
material *in the creation*. <span id="fr_6561"></span>[6562](#fn_6561)
It follows, then, that this rude, and confused, and unarranged portion
cannot be recognized in the polished, and distinct and well-arranged
*parts of creation*, which indeed can hardly with propriety be called
parts of Matter, since they have quitted <span
id="fr_6562"></span>[6563](#fn_6562) its condition, by being separated
from it in the transformation they have undergone.
