<span id="v.iv.iv.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Prophecies of the Death of
Christ.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.xix-p2"></span>Come now, when you read in the words of
David, how that “the Lord reigneth from the tree,” <span
id="fr_3355"></span>[3356](#fn_3355) I want to know what you understand
by it.  Perhaps you think some wooden <span
id="fr_3356"></span>[3357](#fn_3356) king of the Jews is meant!—and not
Christ, who overcame death by His suffering on the cross, and thence
reigned! Now, although death reigned from Adam even to Christ, why may
not Christ be said to have reigned from the tree, from His having shut
up the kingdom of death by dying upon the tree of His cross?  Likewise
Isaiah also says: “For unto us a child is born.” <span
id="fr_3357"></span>[3358](#fn_3357) But what is there unusual in this,
unless he speaks of the Son of God? “To us is given He whose government
is upon His shoulder.” <span id="fr_3358"></span>[3359](#fn_3358) Now,
what king is there who bears the ensign of his dominion upon his
shoulder, and not rather upon his head as a diadem, or in his hand as a
sceptre, or else as a mark in some royal apparel? But the one new King
of the new ages, Jesus Christ, carried on His shoulder both the power
and the excellence of His new glory, even His cross; so that, according
to our former prophecy, He might thenceforth reign from the tree as
Lord.  This tree it is which Jeremiah likewise gives you intimation of,
when he prophesies to the Jews, who should say, “Come, let us destroy
the tree with the fruit, (the bread) thereof,” <span
id="fr_3359"></span>[3360](#fn_3359) that is, His body. For so did God
in your own gospel even reveal the sense, when He called His body
*bread*; so that, for the time to come, you may understand that He has
given to His body the figure of bread, whose body the prophet of old
figuratively turned into bread, the Lord Himself designing to give by
and by an interpretation of the mystery. If you require still further
prediction of the Lord’s cross, the twenty-first Psalm <span
id="fr_3360"></span>[3361](#fn_3360) is sufficiently able to afford it
to you, containing as it does the entire passion of Christ, who was even
then prophetically declaring <span id="fr_3361"></span>[3362](#fn_3361)
His glory. “They pierced,” says He, “my hands and my feet,” <span
id="fr_3362"></span>[3363](#fn_3362) which is the special cruelty of the
cross.  And again, when He implores His Father’s help, He says, “Save me
from the lion’s mouth,” that is, the jaws of death, “and my humiliation
from the horns of the unicorns;” in other words, from the extremities of
the cross, as we have shown above. Now, David himself did not suffer
this cross, nor did any other king of the Jews; so that you cannot
suppose that this is the prophecy of any other’s passion than His who
alone was so notably crucified by the nation.  Now should the heretics,
in their obstinacy, <span id="fr_3363"></span>[3364](#fn_3363) reject
and despise all these interpretations, I will grant to them that the
Creator has given us no signs of the cross of His Christ; but they will
not prove from this concession that He who was crucified was another
(Christ), unless they could somehow show that this death was predicted
as His by their own god, so that from the diversity of predictions there
might be maintained to be a diversity of sufferers, <span
id="fr_3364"></span>[3365](#fn_3364) and thereby also a diversity of
persons.  But since there is no prophecy of even Marcion’s Christ, much
less of his cross, it is enough for my Christ that there is a prophecy
merely of death. For, from the fact that the *kind* of death is not
declared, it was possible for the death of the cross to have been still
intended, which would then have to be assigned to another (Christ), if
the prophecy had had reference to another. Besides, <span
id="fr_3365"></span>[3366](#fn_3365) if he should be unwilling to allow
that the death of my Christ was predicted, his confusion <span
id="page_338">p. 338</span> <span id="v.iv.iv.xix-Page_338"></span>must
be the greater <span id="fr_3366"></span>[3367](#fn_3366) if he
announces that his own Christ indeed died, whom he denies to have had a
nativity, whilst denying that my Christ is mortal, though he allows Him
to be capable of birth. However, I will show him the death, and burial,
and resurrection of my Christ all <span
id="fr_3367"></span>[3368](#fn_3367) indicated in a single sentence of
Isaiah, who says, “His sepulture was removed from the midst of them.”
Now there could have been no sepulture without death, and no removal of
sepulture except by resurrection. Then, finally, he added: “Therefore He
shall have many for his inheritance, and He shall divide the spoil of
the many, because He poured out His soul unto death.” <span
id="fr_3368"></span>[3369](#fn_3368) For there is here set forth the
cause of this favour to Him, even that it was to recompense Him for His
suffering of death. It was equally shown that He was to obtain this
recompense for His death, was certainly to obtain it after His death by
means of the resurrection. <span id="fr_3369"></span>[3370](#fn_3369)
