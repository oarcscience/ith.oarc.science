<span id="iv.vi.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.xiv-p2"></span>Much less may the Christian put the
service of idolatry on his own head—nay, I might have said, upon Christ,
since Christ is the Head of the Christian man—(for his head) is as free
as even Christ is, under no obligation to wear a covering, not to say a
band. But even the head which is bound to have the veil, I mean woman’s,
as already taken possession of by this very thing, is not open also to a
band. She has the burden of her own humility to bear. If she ought not
to appear with her head uncovered on account of the angels, <span
id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436) much more with a crown on it will she
offend those (elders) who perhaps are then wearing crowns above. <span
id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437) For what is a crown on the head of a
woman, but beauty made seductive, but mark of utter wantonness,—a
notable casting away of modesty, a setting temptation on fire? 
Therefore a woman, taking counsel from the apostles’ foresight, <span
id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438) will not too elaborately adorn
herself, that she may not either be crowned with any exquisite
arrangement of her hair.  What sort of garland, however, I pray you, did
He who is the Head of the man and the glory of the woman, Christ Jesus,
the Husband of the church, submit to in behalf of both sexes? Of thorns,
I think, and thistles,—a figure of the sins which the soil of the flesh
brought forth for us, but which the power of the cross removed,
blunting, in its endurance by the head of our Lord, death’s every sting.
Yes, and besides the figure, there is contumely with ready lip, and
dishonour, and infamy, and the ferocity involved in the cruel things
which then disfigured and lacerated the temples of the Lord, that you
may now be crowned with laurel, and myrtle, and olive, and any famous
branch, and which is of more use, with hundred-leaved roses too, culled
from the garden of Midas, and with both kinds of lily, and with violets
of all sorts, perhaps also with gems and gold, so as even to rival that
crown of Christ which He afterwards obtained. For it was after the gall
He tasted the honeycomb <span id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439) and He
was not greeted as King of Glory in heavenly places till He had been
condemned to the cross as King of the Jews, having first been made by
the Father for a time a little less than the angels, and so crowned with
glory and honour. If for these things, you owe your own head to Him,
repay it if you can, such as He presented His for yours; or be not
crowned with flowers at all, if you cannot be with thorns, because you
may not be with flowers.
