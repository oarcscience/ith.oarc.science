<span id="iv.viii.i.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II. <span
id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474) —The Heathen Perverted Judgment in the
Trial of Christians. They Would Be More Consistent If They Dispensed
with All Form of Trial.  Tertullian Urges This with Much
Indignation.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.ii-p3"></span>In this case you actually <span
id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475) conduct trials contrary to the usual
form of judicial process against criminals; for when culprits are
brought up for trial, should they deny the charge, you press them for a
confession by tortures. When Christians, however, confess without
compulsion, you apply the torture to induce them to deny. What great
perverseness is this, when you stand out against confession, *and*
change the use of the torture, compelling the man who frankly
acknowledges the charge <span id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476) to evade
it, and him who is unwilling, to deny it? You, who preside for the
purpose of extorting truth, demand falsehood from us alone that we may
declare ourselves not to be what we are. I suppose you do not want us to
be bad men, and therefore you earnestly wish to exclude us from that
character. To be sure, <span id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477) you put
others on the rack and the gibbet, to get them to deny what they have
the reputation of being. Now, when they deny (the charge against them),
you do not believe them but on our denial, you instantly believe us. If
you feel sure that we are the most injurious of men, why, even in
processes against us, are we dealt with by you differently from other
offenders? I do not mean that you make no account of <span
id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478) either an accusation or a denial (for
your practice is not hastily to condemn men without an indictment and a
defence); but, to take an instance in the trial of a murderer, the case
is not at once ended, or the inquiry satisfied, on a man’s confessing
himself the murderer.  However complete his confession, <span
id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479) you do not readily believe him; but
over and above this, you inquire into accessory circumstances—how often
had he committed murder; with what weapons, in what place, with what
plunder, accomplices, *and* abettors after the fact <span
id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480) (was the crime perpetrated)—to the end
that nothing whatever respecting the criminal might escape detection,
and that every means should be at hand for arriving at a true verdict.
In our case, on the contrary, <span id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481)
whom you believe to be guilty of more atrocious and numerous crimes, you
frame your indictments <span id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482) in
briefer and lighter terms. I suppose you do not care to load with
accusations men whom you earnestly wish to get rid of, or else you do
not think it necessary to inquire into matters which are known to you
already. It is, however, all the more perverse that you compel us to
deny charges about which you have the clearest evidence. But,
indeed, <span id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483) how much more consistent
were it with your hatred of us to dispense with all forms of judicial
process, and to strive with all your might not to urge us to say “No,”
and so have to acquit the objects of your hatred; but to confess all and
singular the crimes laid to our charge, that your resentments might be
the better glutted with an accumulation of our punishments, when it
becomes known how many of those feasts each one of us may have
celebrated, and how many incests we may have committed under cover of
the night! What am I saying? Since your researches for rooting out our
society must needs be made on a wide scale, you ought to extend your
inquiry against our friends and companions. Let our infanticides and the
dressers (of our horrible repasts) be brought out,—ay, and the very dogs
which minister to our (incestuous) nuptials; <span
id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484) then the business (of our trial) would
be without a fault. Even to the crowds which throng the spectacles a
zest would be given; for with how much greater eagerness would they
resort to the theatre, when one had to fight in the lists who had
devoured a hundred babies! For since such horrid and monstrous crimes
are reported of us, they ought, of course, to be brought to light, lest
they should seem to be incredible, and the public detestation of us
should begin to cool. For most persons are slow to believe such
things, <span id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485) feeling a horrible
disgust at supposing that our nature could have an appetite <span
id="page_111">p. 111</span> <span id="iv.viii.i.ii-Page_111"></span>for
the food of wild beasts, when it has precluded these from all
concubinage with the race of man.

<span id="iv.viii.i.ii-p13"></span> We have for once departed from
Oehler’s text, and preferred Rigault’s:  “Perducerentur *infantarii* et
coci, ipsi canes pronubi, emendata esset res.” The sense is evident from
*The Apology*, c. vii.: “It is said that we are guilty of most horrible
crimes; that in the celebration of our sacrament we put a child to
death, which we afterward devour, and at the end of our banquet revel in
incest; that we employ dogs as ministers of our impure delights, to
overthrow the candles, and thus to provide darkness, and remove all
shame which might interfere with these impious lusts” (Chevalier’s
translation). These calumnies were very common, and are noticed by
Justin Martyr, Minucius Felix, Eusebius, Athenagoras, and Origen, who
attributes their origin to the Jews.  Oehler reads *infantariæ*, after
the Agobardine codex and *editio princeps*, and quotes Martial (*Epigr*.
iv. 88), where the word occurs in the sense of an inordinate love of
children.
