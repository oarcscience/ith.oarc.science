<p class="c28"><a name="vi.vi.i-p4"></A><span class="c6"><a name="vi.vi.i-p4.1"></A>[Translated by the Rev. R. E. Wallis, Ph.D.]</span></p> 
<p class="Centered"><a name="vi.vi.i-p5"></A> &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="vi.vi.i-p6"></A><span class="sc"><a name="vi.vi.i-p6.1"></A>Nobody</span>, will blame me for placing here the touching history of these Martyrs.&#160; It illustrates the period of history we are now considering, and sheds light on the preceding treatise. I can hardly read it without tears, and it ought to make us love &#8220;the noble army of martyrs.&#8221; I think Tertullian was the <i>editor</i> of the story, not its author.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8969"></A><A HREF="#fn_8969"><FONT SIZE="1">8970</FONT></A>
 Felicitas is mentioned by name in the <i>De Anima</i>: and the closing paragraph of this memoir is quite in his style. To these words I need only add that Dr. Routh, who unfortunately decided not to re-edit it, ascribes the first edition to Lucas Holstenius.&#160; He was Librarian of the Vatican and died in 1661. The rest may be learned from this <span class="sc"><a name="vi.vi.i-p7.1"></A>Introductory Notice</span> of the Translator:</p> 
<p class="c20"><a name="vi.vi.i-p8"></A>Perpetua and Felicitas suffered martyrdom in the reign of Septimius Severus, about the year 202 <span class="sc"><a name="vi.vi.i-p8.2"></A>a.d.</span> Tertullian mentions Perpetua,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8970"></A><A HREF="#fn_8970"><FONT SIZE="1">8971</FONT></A>
 and a further clue to the date is given in the allusion to the birth-day of &#8220;Geta the C&aelig;sar,&#8221; the son of Septimius Severus.&#160; There is therefore, good reason for rejecting the opinion held by some, that they suffered under Valerian and Gallienus. Some think that they suffered at Tuburbium in Mauritania; but the more general opinion is, that Carthage was the scene of their martyrdom.</p> 
<p class="c20"><a name="vi.vi.i-p10"></A>The &#8220;Acta,&#8221; detailing the sufferings of Perpetua and Felicitas, has been held by all critics to be a genuine document of antiquity. But much difference exists as to who was the compiler. In the writing itself, Perpetua and Saturus are mentioned as having written certain portions of it; and there is no reason to doubt the statement. Who the writer of the remaining portion was, is not known. Some have assigned the work to Tertullian; some have maintained that, whoever the writer was, he was a Montanist, and some have tried to show that both martyrs and narrator were Montanists.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8971"></A><A HREF="#fn_8971"><FONT SIZE="1">8972</FONT></A>
 The narrator must have been a contemporary; according to many critics, he was an eye-witness of the sufferings of the martyrs. And he must have written the narrative shortly after the events.</p> 
<p class="c20"><a name="vi.vi.i-p12"></A>Dean Milman says, &#8220;There appear strong indications that the acts of these African martyrs are translated from the Greek; at least it is difficult otherwise to account for the frequent untranslated Greek words and idioms in the text.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8972"></A><A HREF="#fn_8972"><FONT SIZE="1">8973</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c20"><a name="vi.vi.i-p14"></A>The Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas was edited by Petrus Possinus, Rome, 1663; by Henr. Valesius, Paris, 1664; and the Bollandists. The best and latest edition is by Ruissart, whose text is adopted in Gallandi&#146;s and Migne&#146;s collections of the Fathers.</p>
