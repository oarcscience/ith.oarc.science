<span id="iv.iv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Of Blasphemy. One of St. Paul’s
Sayings.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xiv-p2"></span>But, however, the majority (of
Christians) have by this time induced the belief in their mind that it
is pardonable if at any time they do what the heathen do, for fear “the
Name be blasphemed.” Now the blasphemy which must quite be shunned by us
in every way is, I take it, this: If any of us lead a heathen into
blasphemy with good cause, either by fraud, or by injury, or by
contumely, or any other matter of worthy complaint, in which “the Name”
is deservedly impugned, so that the Lord, too, be deservedly angry. 
Else, if of *all* blasphemy it has been said, “By your means My Name is
blasphemed,” <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262) we all perish at
once; since the whole circus, with no desert of ours, assails “the Name”
with wicked suffrages. Let us cease (to be Christians) and it will not
be blasphemed! On the contrary, while we are, let it be blasphemed: in
the observance, not the overstepping, of discipline; while we are being
approved, not while we are being reprobated. Oh blasphemy, bordering on
martyrdom, which now *at*tests me to be a Christian, <span
id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263) while for that very account it
*de*tests me! The cursing of well-maintained Discipline is a blessing of
the Name.  “If,” says he, “I wished to please men, I should not be
Christ’s servant.” <span id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264) But the same
apostle elsewhere bids us take care to please all: “As I,” he says,
“please all by all means.” <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265) No
doubt he used to please them by celebrating the Saturnalia and
New-year’s day!  \[Was it so\] or was it by moderation and patience? by
gravity, by kindness, by integrity? In like manner, when he is saying,
“I have become all things to all, that I may gain all,” <span
id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266) does he mean “to idolaters an
idolater?” “to heathens a heathen?” “to the worldly worldly?” But albeit
he does not prohibit us from having our conversation with idolaters and
adulterers, and the other criminals, saying, “Otherwise ye would go out
from the world,” <span id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267) of course he
does not so slacken those reins of conversation that, since it is
necessary for us both to *live* and to *mingle* with sinners, we may be
able to *sin* with them too. Where there is the intercourse of life,
which the apostle concedes, there is sinning, which no one permits. To
live with heathens is lawful, to die with <span id="page_70">p.
70</span> <span id="iv.iv.xiv-Page_70"></span>them <span
id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268) is not. Let us live with all; <span
id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269) let us be glad with them, out of
community of nature, not of superstition. We are peers in soul, not in
discipline; fellow-possessors of the world, not of error.  But if we
have no right of communion in matters of this kind with strangers, how
far more wicked to celebrate them among brethren! Who can maintain or
defend this? The Holy Spirit upbraids the Jews with their holy-days.
“Your Sabbaths, and new moons, and ceremonies,” says He, “My soul
hateth.” <span id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270) By us, to whom Sabbaths
are strange, <span id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271) and the new moons
and festivals formerly beloved by God, the Saturnalia and New-year’s and
Midwinter’s festivals and Matronalia are frequented—presents come and
go—New-year’s gifts—games join their noise—banquets join their din! Oh
better fidelity of the nations to their own sect, which claims no
solemnity of the Christians for itself! Not the Lord’s day, not
Pentecost, even it they had known them, would they have shared with us;
for they would fear lest they should seem to be Christians. *We* are not
apprehensive lest we seem to be *heathens*! If any indulgence is to be
granted to the flesh, you have it. I will not say your own days, <span
id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272) but more too; for to the *heathens*
each festive day occurs but once annually:  *you* have a festive day
every eighth day. <span id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273) Call out the
individual solemnities of the nations, and set them out into a row, they
will not be able to make up a Pentecost. <span
id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274)
