<span id="v.viii.lvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.lvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVI.—The Procedure of the Last
Judgment, and Its Awards, Only Possible on the Identity of the Risen
Body with Our Present Flesh.</span>

<span id="v.viii.lvi-p2"></span>For how absurd, and in truth how unjust,
and in both respects how unworthy of God, for one substance to do the
work, and another to reap the reward:  that this flesh of ours should be
torn by martyrdom, and another wear the crown; or, on the other hand,
that this flesh of ours should wallow in uncleanness, and another
receive the condemnation! Is it not better to renounce all faith at once
in the hope of the resurrection, <span
id="fr_7714"></span>[7715](#fn_7714) than to trifle with the wisdom and
justice of God? <span id="fr_7715"></span>[7716](#fn_7715) Better that
Marcion should rise again than Valentinus. For it cannot be believed
that the mind, or the memory, or the conscience of existing man is
abolished by putting on that change of raiment which immortality and
incorruption supplies; for in that case all the gain and fruit of the
resurrection, and the permanent effect <span
id="fr_7716"></span>[7717](#fn_7716) of God’s judgment both on soul and
body, <span id="fr_7717"></span>[7718](#fn_7717) would certainly fall to
the ground. If I remember not that it is I who have served Him, how
shall I ascribe glory to God? How sing to Him “the new song,” <span
id="fr_7718"></span>[7719](#fn_7718) if I am ignorant that it is I who
owe Him thanks? But why is exception taken only against the change of
the flesh, and not of the soul also, which in all things is superior to
the flesh? How happens it, that the self-same soul which in our present
flesh has gone through all life’s course, which has learnt the knowledge
of God, and put on Christ, and sown the hope of salvation in this flesh,
must reap its harvest in another flesh of which we know nothing? Verily
that must be a most highly favoured flesh, which shall have the
enjoyment of life at so gratuitous a rate! But if the soul is not to be
changed also, then there is no resurrection of the soul; nor will it be
believed to have itself risen, unless it has risen some different thing.
