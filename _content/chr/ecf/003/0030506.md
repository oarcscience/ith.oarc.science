<span id="v.v.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.—Ironical Dilemmas Respecting
Matter, and Sundry Moral Qualities Fancifully Attributed to It.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxxvii-p2"></span>I see now that you are coming back again
to that reason, which has been in the habit of declaring to you nothing
in the way of certainty. For just as you introduce to our notice Matter
as being neither corporeal nor incorporeal, so you allege of it that it
is neither good nor evil; and you say, whilst arguing further on it in
the same strain: “If it were good, seeing that it had ever been so, it
would not require the arrangement of itself by God; <span
id="fr_6527"></span>[6528](#fn_6527) if it were naturally evil, it would
not have admitted of a change <span id="fr_6528"></span>[6529](#fn_6528)
for the better, nor would God have ever applied to such a nature any
attempt at arrangement of it, for His labour would have been in vain.”
Such are your words, which it would have been well if you had remembered
in other passages also, so as to have avoided any contradiction of them.
As, however, we have already treated to some extent of this ambiguity of
good and evil touching Matter, I will now reply to the only proposition
and argument of yours which we have before us. I shall not stop to
repeat my opinion, that it was your bounden duty to have said for
certain that Matter was either good or bad, or in some third condition;
but (I must observe) that you have not here even kept to the statement
which you chose to make before. Indeed, you retract what you
declared—that Matter is neither good nor evil; because you imply that it
is evil when you say, “If it were good, it would not require to be set
in order by God;” so again, when you add, “If it were naturally evil, it
would not admit of any change for the better,” you seem to
intimate <span id="fr_6529"></span>[6530](#fn_6529) that it is good. And
so you attribute to it a close relation <span
id="fr_6530"></span>[6531](#fn_6530) to good and evil, although you
declared it neither good nor evil. With a view, however, to refute the
argument whereby you thought you were going to clinch your proposition,
I here contend: If Matter had always been good, why should it not have
*still* wanted a change for the better? Does that which is good never
desire, never wish, never feel able to advance, so as to change its good
for a better? And in like manner, if *Matter* had been by nature evil,
why might it not have been changed by God as the more powerful Being, as
able to convert the nature of stones into children of Abraham? <span
id="fr_6531"></span>[6532](#fn_6531) Surely by such means you not only
compare the Lord with Matter, but you even put Him below <span
id="fr_6532"></span>[6533](#fn_6532) it, since you affirm that <span
id="fr_6533"></span>[6534](#fn_6533) the nature of Matter could not
<span id="page_499">p. 499</span> <span
id="v.v.xxxvii-Page_499"></span>possibly be brought under control by
Him, and trained to something better. But although you are here
disinclined to allow that Matter is by nature evil, yet in another
passage you will deny having made such an admission. <span
