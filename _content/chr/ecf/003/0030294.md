id="v.iii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—The One Tradition of the
Faith, Which is Substantially Alike in the Churches Everywhere, a Good
Proof that the Transmission Has Been True and Honest in the Main.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxviii-p2"></span>Grant, then, that all have erred; that
the apostle was mistaken in giving his testimony; that the Holy Ghost
had no such respect to any one (church) as to lead it into truth,
although sent with this view by Christ, <span
id="fr_2145"></span>[2146](#fn_2145) and for this asked of the Father
that He might be the teacher of truth; <span
id="fr_2146"></span>[2147](#fn_2146) grant, also, that He, the Steward
of God, the Vicar of Christ, <span id="fr_2147"></span>[2148](#fn_2147)
neglected His office, permitting the churches for a time to understand
differently, (and) to believe differently, what He Himself was preaching
by the apostles,—is it likely that so many churches, and they so great,
should have gone astray into one and the same faith?  No casualty
distributed among many men issues in one and the same result. Error of
doctrine in the churches must necessarily have produced various issues. 
When, however, that which is deposited among many is found to be one and
the same, it is not the result of error, but of tradition. Can any one,
then, be reckless <span id="fr_2148"></span>[2149](#fn_2148) enough to
say that they were in error who handed on the tradition?
