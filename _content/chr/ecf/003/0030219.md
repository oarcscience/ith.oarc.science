<span id="iv.xi.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—The Soul’s Vitality and
Intelligence. Its Character and Seat in Man.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xv-p2"></span>In the first place, (we must determine)
whether there be in the soul some supreme principle of vitality and
intelligence <span id="fr_1582"></span>[1583](#fn_1582) which they call
“the ruling power of the soul”—<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xi.xv-p3.1"></span>τὸ ἡγεμονικόν</span> for if this be not
admitted, the whole condition of the soul is put in jeopardy. Indeed,
those men who say that there is no such directing faculty, have begun by
supposing that the soul itself is simply a nonentity. One Dicæarchus, a
Messenian, and amongst the medical profession Andreas and Asclepiades,
have thus destroyed the (soul’s) directing power, by actually placing in
the mind the senses, for which they claim the ruling faculty.
Asclepiades rides rough-shod over us with even this argument, that very
many animals, after losing those parts of their body in which the soul’s
principle of vitality and sensation is thought mainly to exist, still
retain life in a considerable degree, as well as sensation: as in the
case of flies, and wasps, and locusts, when you have cut off their
heads; and of she-goats, and tortoises, and eels, when you have pulled
out their hearts. (He concludes), therefore, that there is no especial
principle or power of the <span id="page_194">p. 194</span> <span
id="iv.xi.xv-Page_194"></span>soul; for if there were, the soul’s vigour
and strength could not continue when it was removed with its domiciles
(or corporeal organs).  However, Dicæarchus has several authorities
against him—and philosophers too—Plato, Strato, Epicurus, Democritus,
Empedocles, Socrates, Aristotle; whilst in opposition to Andreas and
Asclepiades (may be placed their brother) physicians Herophilus,
Erasistratus, Diocles, Hippocrates, and Soranus himself; and better than
all others, there are our Christian authorities. We are taught by God
concerning both these questions—viz. that there is a ruling power in the
soul, and that it is enshrined <span
id="fr_1583"></span>[1584](#fn_1583) in one particular recess of the
body.  For, when one reads of God as being “the searcher and witness of
the heart;” <span id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584) when His prophet
is reproved by His discovering to him the secrets of the heart; <span
id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585) when God Himself anticipates in His
people the thoughts of their heart, <span
id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586) “Why think ye evil in your
hearts?” <span id="fr_1587"></span>[1588](#fn_1587) when David prays
“Create in me a clean heart, O God,” <span
id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588) and Paul declares, “With the heart
man believeth unto righteousness,” <span
id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589) and John says, “By his own heart is
each man condemned;” <span id="fr_1590"></span>[1591](#fn_1590) when,
lastly, “he who looketh on a woman so as to lust after her, hath already
committed adultery with her in his heart,” <span
id="fr_1591"></span>[1592](#fn_1591) —then both points are cleared fully
up, that there is a directing faculty of the soul, with which the
purpose of God may agree; in other words, a supreme principle of
intelligence and vitality (for where there is intelligence, there must
be vitality), and that it resides in that most precious part <span
id="fr_1592"></span>[1593](#fn_1592) of our body to which God especially
looks:  so that you must not suppose, with Heraclitus, that this
sovereign faculty of which we are treating is moved by some external
force; nor with Moschion, <span id="fr_1593"></span>[1594](#fn_1593)
that it floats about through the whole body; nor with Plato, that it is
enclosed in the head; nor with Zenophanes, that it culminates in the
crown of the head; nor that it reposes in the brain, according to the
opinion of Hippocrates; nor around the basis of the brain, as Herophilus
thought; nor in the membranes thereof, as Strato and Erasistratus said;
nor in the space between the eyebrows, as Strato the physician held; nor
within the enclosure <span id="fr_1594"></span>[1595](#fn_1594) of the
breast, according to Epicurus:  but rather, as the Egyptians have always
taught, especially such of them as were accounted the expounders of
sacred truths; <span id="fr_1595"></span>[1596](#fn_1595) in accordance,
too, with that verse of Orpheus or Empedocles:

<span id="iv.xi.xv-p17"></span>“Namque homini sanguis circumcordialis
est sensus.” <span id="fr_1596"></span>[1597](#fn_1596)

<span id="iv.xi.xv-p19"></span>“Man has his (supreme) sensation in the
blood around his heart.”

<span id="iv.xi.xv-p20"></span>Even Protagoras <span
id="fr_1597"></span>[1598](#fn_1597) likewise, and Apollodorus, and
Chrysippus, entertain this same view, so that (our friend) Asclepiades
may go in quest of his goats bleating without a heart, and hunt his
flies without their heads; and let all those (worthies), too, who have
predetermined the character of the human soul from the condition of
brute animals, be quite sure that it is themselves rather who are alive
in a heartless and brainless state.
