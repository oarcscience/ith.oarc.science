<span id="vi.ii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.ii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Examples from Scripture to
Prove the Lord’s Willingness to Pardon.</span>

<span id="vi.ii.viii-p2"></span>This if you doubt, unravel <span
id="fr_8488"></span>[8489](#fn_8488) the meaning of “what the Spirit
saith to the churches.” <span id="fr_8489"></span>[8490](#fn_8489) He
imputes to the Ephesians “forsaken love;” <span
id="fr_8490"></span>[8491](#fn_8490) reproaches the Thyatirenes with
“fornication,” and “eating of things sacrificed to idols;” <span
id="fr_8491"></span>[8492](#fn_8491) accuses the Sardians of “works not
full;” <span id="fr_8492"></span>[8493](#fn_8492) censures the
Pergamenes for teaching perverse things; <span
id="fr_8493"></span>[8494](#fn_8493) upbraids the Laodiceans for
trusting to their riches; <span id="fr_8494"></span>[8495](#fn_8494) and
yet gives them all general monitions to repentance—under comminations,
it is true; but He would not utter comminations to one *un*repentant if
He did not forgive the repentant. The matter were doubtful if He had not
withal elsewhere demonstrated this profusion of His clemency. Saith He
not, <span id="fr_8495"></span>[8496](#fn_8495) “He who hath fallen
shall rise again, and he who hath been *a*verted shall be *con*verted?”
He it is, indeed, who “would have mercy rather than sacrifices.” <span
id="fr_8496"></span>[8497](#fn_8496) The heavens, and the angels who are
there, are glad at a man’s repentance. <span
id="fr_8497"></span>[8498](#fn_8497) Ho! you sinner, be of good cheer!
you see where it is that there is joy at your return.  What meaning for
us have those themes of the Lord’s parables? Is not the fact that a
woman has lost a drachma, and seeks it and finds it, and invites her
female friends to share her joy, an example of a restored sinner? <span
id="fr_8498"></span>[8499](#fn_8498) There strays, withal, one little
ewe of the shepherd’s; but the flock was not more dear than the one:
that one is earnestly sought; the one is longed for instead of all; and
at length she is found, and is borne back on the shoulders of the
shepherd himself; for much had she toiled <span
id="fr_8499"></span>[8500](#fn_8499) in straying. <span
id="fr_8500"></span>[8501](#fn_8500) That most gentle father, likewise,
I will not pass over in silence, who calls his prodigal son home, and
willingly receives him repentant after his indigence, slays his best
fatted calf, and graces his joy with a banquet. <span
id="fr_8501"></span>[8502](#fn_8501) Why not?  He had found the son whom
he had lost; he had felt *him* to be all the dearer of whom he had *made
a gain*. Who is that father to be understood by us to be?  God, surely:
no one *is* so truly a Father; <span
id="fr_8502"></span>[8503](#fn_8502) no one so rich in paternal love.
He, then, will receive you, His own son, <span
id="fr_8503"></span>[8504](#fn_8503) back, even if you have squandered
what you had received from Him, even if you return naked—just because
you *have* returned; and will joy more over your return than over the
sobriety of the other; <span id="fr_8504"></span>[8505](#fn_8504) but
*only* if you heartily repent—if you compare your own hunger with the
plenty of your Father’s “hired servants”—if you leave behind you the
swine, that unclean herd—if you again seek your Father, offended though
He be, saying, “I have sinned, nor am worthy any longer to be called
Thine.”  Confession of sins lightens, as much as dissimulation
aggravates them; for confession is counselled by <span id="page_664">p.
664</span> <span id="vi.ii.viii-Page_664"></span>(a desire to make)
satisfaction, dissimulation by contumacy.
