<span id="v.iv.iv.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Community in Certain Points of
Marcionite and Jewish Error. Prophecies of Christ’s Rejection
Examined.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.vi-p2"></span>Since, therefore, there clearly exist
these two characteristics in the Jewish prophetic literature, let the
reader remember, <span id="fr_3156"></span>[3157](#fn_3156) whenever we
adduce any evidence therefrom, that, by mutual consent, <span
id="fr_3157"></span>[3158](#fn_3157) the point of discussion is not the
form of the scripture, but the subject it is called in to prove. When,
therefore, our heretics in their phrenzy presumed to say that that
Christ was come who had never been fore-announced, it followed that, on
their assumption, that Christ had not yet appeared who <span
id="page_325">p. 325</span> <span id="v.iv.iv.vi-Page_325"></span>had
always been predicted; and thus they are obliged to make common cause
with <span id="fr_3158"></span>[3159](#fn_3158) Jewish error, and
construct their arguments with its assistance, on the pretence that the
Jews were themselves quite certain that it was some other who came: so
they not only rejected Him as a stranger, but slew Him as an enemy,
although they would without doubt have acknowledged Him, and with all
religious devotion followed Him, if He had only been one of themselves.
Our shipmaster <span id="fr_3159"></span>[3160](#fn_3159) of course got
his craft-wisdom not from the Rhodian law, <span
id="fr_3160"></span>[3161](#fn_3160) but from the Pontic, <span
id="fr_3161"></span>[3162](#fn_3161) which cautioned him against
believing that the Jews had no right to sin against their Christ;
whereas (even if nothing like their conduct had been predicted against
them) human nature alone, liable to error as it is, might well have
induced him to suppose that it was quite possible for the Jews to have
committed such a sin, considered as men, without assuming any unfair
prejudice regarding their feelings, whose sin was antecedently so
credible. Since, however, it was actually foretold that they would not
acknowledge Christ, and therefore would even put Him to death, it will
therefore follow that He was both ignored <span
id="fr_3162"></span>[3163](#fn_3162) and slain by them, who were
beforehand pointed out as being about to commit such offences against
Him. If you require a proof of this, instead of turning out those
passages of Scripture which, while they declare Christ to be capable of
suffering death, do thereby also affirm the possibility of His being
rejected (for if He had not been rejected, He could not really suffer
anything), but rather reserving them for the subject of His sufferings,
I shall content myself at the present moment with adducing those which
simply show that there was a probability of Christ’s rejection. This is
quickly done, since the passages indicate that the entire power of
understanding was by the Creator taken from the people. “I will take
away,” says He, “the wisdom of their wise men; and the understanding of
their prudent men will I hide;” <span
id="fr_3163"></span>[3164](#fn_3163) and again: “With your ear ye shall
hear, and not understand; and with your eyes ye shall see, but not
perceive: for the heart of this people hath growth fat, and with their
ears they hear heavily, and their eyes have they shut; lest they hear
with their ears, and see with their eyes, and understand with the heart,
and be converted, and I heal them.” <span
id="fr_3164"></span>[3165](#fn_3164) Now this blunting of their sound
senses they had brought on themselves, loving God with their lips, but
keeping far away from Him in their heart. Since, then, Christ was
announced by the Creator, “who formeth the lightning, and createth the
wind, and declareth unto man His Christ,” as the prophet Joel
says, <span id="fr_3165"></span>[3166](#fn_3165) since the entire hope
of the Jews, not to say of the Gentiles too, was fixed on the
manifestation of Christ,—it was demonstrated that they, by their being
deprived of those powers of knowledge and understanding—wisdom and
prudence, would fail to know and understand that which was predicted,
even Christ; when the chief of their wise men should be in error
respecting Him—that is to say, their scribes and prudent ones, or
Pharisees; and when the people, like them, should hear with their ears
and not understand Christ while teaching them, and see with their eyes
and not perceive Christ, although giving them signs. Similarly it is
said elsewhere: “Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, but he who
ruleth over them?” <span id="fr_3166"></span>[3167](#fn_3166) Also when
He upbraids them by the same Isaiah: “I have nourished and brought up
children, and they have rebelled against me.  The ox knoweth his owner,
and the ass his master’s crib: but Israel doth not know; my people doth
not consider.” <span id="fr_3167"></span>[3168](#fn_3167) We indeed, who
know for certain that Christ always spoke in the prophets, as the Spirit
of the Creator (for so says the prophet: “The person of our Spirit,
Christ the Lord,” <span id="fr_3168"></span>[3169](#fn_3168) who from
the beginning was both heard and seen as the Father’s vicegerent in the
name of God), are well aware that His words, when actually upbraiding
Israel, were the same as those which it was foretold that He should
denounce against him: “Ye have forsaken the Lord, and have provoked the
Holy One of Israel to anger.” <span id="fr_3169"></span>[3170](#fn_3169)
If, however, you would rather refer to God Himself, instead of to
Christ, the whole imputation of Jewish ignorance from the first, through
an unwillingness to allow that even anciently <span
id="fr_3170"></span>[3171](#fn_3170) the Creator’s word and Spirit—that
is to say, His Christ—was despised and not acknowledged by them, you
will even in this subterfuge be defeated. <span id="page_326">p.
326</span> <span id="v.iv.iv.vi-Page_326"></span>For when you do not
deny that the Creator’s Son and Spirit and Substance is also His Christ,
you must needs allow that those who have not acknowledged the Father
have failed likewise to acknowledge the Son through the identity of
their natural substance; <span id="fr_3171"></span>[3172](#fn_3171) for
if in Its fulness It has baffled man’s understanding, much more has a
portion of It, especially when partaking of the fulness. <span
id="fr_3172"></span>[3173](#fn_3172) Now, when these things are
carefully considered, it becomes evident how the Jews both rejected
Christ and slew Him; not because they regarded Him as a strange Christ,
but because they did not acknowledge Him, although their own. For how
could they have understood the strange One, concerning whom nothing had
ever been announced, when they failed to understand Him about whom there
had been a perpetual course of prophecy? That admits of being understood
or being not understood, which, by possessing a substantial basis for
prophecy, <span id="fr_3173"></span>[3174](#fn_3173) will also have a
subject-matter <span id="fr_3174"></span>[3175](#fn_3174) for either
knowledge or error; whilst that which lacks such matter admits not the
issue of wisdom. So that it was not as if He belonged to another <span
id="fr_3175"></span>[3176](#fn_3175) god that they conceived an aversion
for Christ, and persecuted Him, but simply as a man whom they regarded
as a wonder-working juggler, <span id="fr_3176"></span>[3177](#fn_3176)
and an enemy <span id="fr_3177"></span>[3178](#fn_3177) in His
doctrines. They brought Him therefore to trial as a mere man, and one of
themselves too—that is, a Jew (only a renegade and a destroyer of
Judaism)—and punished Him according to their law. If He had been a
stranger, indeed, they would not have sat in judgment over Him. So far
are they from appearing to have understood Him to be a strange Christ,
that they did not even judge Him to be a stranger to their own human
nature. <span id="fr_3178"></span>[3179](#fn_3178)

See Oehler’s marginal reference. If so, the reference to Joel is either
a slip of Tertullian or a corruption of his text; more likely the
former, for the best <span class="sc"><span
id="v.iv.iv.vi-p12.3"></span>mss.</span> insert Joel’s name. [Amos iv.
13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013)<span id="v.iv.iv.vi-p12.4"></span>,
according to the LXX., runs, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.iv.vi-p12.5"></span>᾽Απαγγέλλων εἰς ἀνθρώπους τὸν Χριστὸν
αὐτοῦ</span>, which exactly suits Tertullian’s quotation. Junius
supports the reference to Joel, supposing that Tertullian has his ch.
ii. 31 in view, as compared with [Acts ii.
16-33](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#016)<span
id="v.iv.iv.vi-p12.6"></span>. This is too harsh an interpretation. It
is simpler and better to suppose that Tertullian really meant to quote
the LXX. of the passage in Amos, but in mistake named Joel as his
prophet.
