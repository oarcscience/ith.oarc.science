<span id="v.viii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Not the Lowliness of the
Material, But the Dignity and Skill of the Maker, Must Be Remembered, in
Gauging the Excellence of the Flesh. Christ Partook of Our Flesh.</span>

<span id="v.viii.vi-p2"></span>Let me therefore pursue the subject
before me—if I can but succeed in vindicating for the flesh as much as
was conferred on it by Him who made it, glorying as it even then was,
because that poor paltry material, clay, found its way into the hands of
God, whatever these were, happy enough at merely being touched by them.
But why *this glorying*? Was it that, <span
id="fr_7324"></span>[7325](#fn_7324) without any further labour, the
clay had instantly assumed its form at the touch of God? The truth
is, <span id="fr_7325"></span>[7326](#fn_7325) a great matter was in
progress, out of which the creature under consideration <span
id="fr_7326"></span>[7327](#fn_7326) was being fashioned. So often then
does it receive honour, as often as it experiences the hands of God,
when it is touched by them, and pulled, and drawn out, and moulded into
shape. Imagine God wholly employed and absorbed in it—in His hand, His
eye, His labour, His purpose, His wisdom, His providence, and above all,
in His love, which was dictating the lineaments (of this creature). For,
whatever was the form and expression which was then given to the clay
(by the Creator) Christ was in His thoughts as one day to become man,
because the Word, too, was to be both clay and flesh, even as the earth
was then.  For so did the Father previously say to the Son: “Let us make
man in our own image, after our likeness.” <span
id="fr_7327"></span>[7328](#fn_7327) And God made man, that is to say,
the creature which He moulded and fashioned; after the image of God (in
other words, of Christ) did He make him. And the Word was God also, who
being <span id="fr_7328"></span>[7329](#fn_7328) in the image of God,
“thought it not robbery to be equal to God.” <span
id="fr_7329"></span>[7330](#fn_7329) Thus, that clay which was even then
putting on the image of Christ, who was to come in the flesh, was not
only the work, but also the pledge and surety, of God.  To what purpose
is it to bandy about the name *earth*, as that of a sordid and
grovelling element, with the view of tarnishing the origin of the flesh,
when, even if any other material had been available for forming man, it
would be requisite that the dignity of the Maker should be taken into
consideration, who even by His selection of His material deemed it, and
by His management made it, worthy? The hand of Phidias forms the
Olympian Jupiter of ivory; worship is given *to the statue*, and it is
no longer regarded as a god *formed* out of a most silly animal, but as
the world’s supreme Deity—<span id="page_550">p. 550</span> <span
id="v.viii.vi-Page_550"></span>not because of the bulk of the elephant,
but on account of the renown of Phidias. Could not therefore the living
God, the true God, purge away by His own operation whatever vileness
might have accrued to His material, and heal it of all infirmity? Or
must this remain *to show* how much more nobly man could fabricate a
god, than God could form a man? Now, although the clay is offensive (for
its poorness), it is now something else. What I possess is flesh, not
earth, even although of the flesh it is said: “Dust thou art, and unto
dust shalt thou return.” <span id="fr_7330"></span>[7331](#fn_7330) In
these words there is the mention of the origin, not a recalling of the
substance.  The privilege has been granted *to the flesh* to be nobler
than its origin, and to have happiness aggrandized by the change wrought
in it. Now, even gold is earth, because of the earth; but it remains
earth no longer after it becomes gold, but is a far different substance,
more splendid and more noble, though coming from a source which is
comparatively faded and obscure. In like manner, it was quite allowable
for God that He should clear the gold of our flesh from all the taints,
as you deem them, of its *native* clay, by purging the original
substance of its dross.
