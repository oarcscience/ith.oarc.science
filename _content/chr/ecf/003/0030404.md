<span id="v.iv.v.v"></span>

<span id="v.iv.v.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—By the Rule of Antiquity, the
Catholic Gospels are Found to Be True, Including the Real St. Luke’s.
Marcion’s Only a Mutilated Edition. The Heretic’s Weakness and
Inconsistency in Ignoring the Other Gospels. <span
id="fr_3584"></span>[3585](#fn_3584) </span>

<span id="v.iv.v.v-p3"></span>On the whole, then, if that is evidently
more true which is earlier, if that is earlier which is from the very
beginning, if that is from the beginning which has the apostles for its
authors, then it will certainly be quite as evident, that that comes
down from the apos<span id="page_350">p. 350</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.v-Page_350"></span>tles, which has been kept as a sacred
deposit <span id="fr_3585"></span>[3586](#fn_3585) in the churches of
the apostles. Let us see what milk the Corinthians drank from Paul; to
what rule *of faith* the Galatians were brought for correction; what the
Philippians, the Thessalonians, the Ephesians read *by it*; what
utterance also the Romans give, so very near <span
id="fr_3586"></span>[3587](#fn_3586) (to the apostles), to whom Peter
and Paul conjointly <span id="fr_3587"></span>[3588](#fn_3587)
bequeathed the gospel even sealed with their own blood. We have also
*St.* John’s foster churches. <span id="fr_3588"></span>[3589](#fn_3588)
For although Marcion rejects his Apocalypse, the order <span
id="fr_3589"></span>[3590](#fn_3589) of the bishops (thereof), when
traced up to their origin, will yet rest on John as their author. In the
same manner is recognised the excellent source <span
id="fr_3590"></span>[3591](#fn_3590) of the other churches. I say,
therefore, that in them (and not simply such of them as were founded by
apostles, but in all those which are united with them in the fellowship
of the mystery *of the gospel of Christ* <span
id="fr_3591"></span>[3592](#fn_3591) ) that Gospel of Luke which we are
defending with all our might has stood its ground from its very first
publication; whereas Marcion’s Gospel is not known to most people, and
to none whatever is it known without being at the same time <span
id="fr_3592"></span>[3593](#fn_3592) condemned. It too, of course, <span
id="fr_3593"></span>[3594](#fn_3593) has its churches, but specially its
own—as late as they are spurious; and should you want to know their
original, <span id="fr_3594"></span>[3595](#fn_3594) you will more
easily discover apostasy in it than apostolicity, with Marcion forsooth
as their founder, or some one of Marcion’s swarm. <span
id="fr_3595"></span>[3596](#fn_3595) Even wasps make combs; <span
id="fr_3596"></span>[3597](#fn_3596) so also these Marcionites make
churches.  The same authority of the apostolic churches will afford
evidence <span id="fr_3597"></span>[3598](#fn_3597) to the other Gospels
also, which we possess equally through their means, <span
id="fr_3598"></span>[3599](#fn_3598) and according to their usage—I mean
the Gospels of John and Matthew—whilst that which Mark published may be
affirmed to be Peter’s <span id="fr_3599"></span>[3600](#fn_3599) whose
interpreter Mark was. For even Luke’s form <span
id="fr_3600"></span>[3601](#fn_3600) of the Gospel men usually ascribe
to Paul. <span id="fr_3601"></span>[3602](#fn_3601) And it may well
seem <span id="fr_3602"></span>[3603](#fn_3602) that the works which
disciples publish belong to their masters. Well, then, Marcion ought to
be called to a strict account <span id="fr_3603"></span>[3604](#fn_3603)
concerning these (other Gospels) also, for having omitted them, and
insisted in preference <span id="fr_3604"></span>[3605](#fn_3604) on
Luke; as if they, too, had not had free course in the churches, as well
as Luke’s Gospel, from the beginning. Nay, it is even more credible that
they <span id="fr_3605"></span>[3606](#fn_3605) existed from the very
beginning; for, being the work of apostles, they were prior, and coeval
in origin with <span id="fr_3606"></span>[3607](#fn_3606) the churches
themselves. But how comes it to pass, if the apostles published nothing,
that their disciples were more forward in such a work; for they could
not have been disciples, without any instruction from their masters? If,
then, it be evident that these (Gospels) also were current in the
churches, why did not Marcion touch them—either to amend them if they
were adulterated, or to acknowledge them if they were uncorrupt?  For it
is but natural <span id="fr_3607"></span>[3608](#fn_3607) that they who
were perverting the gospel, should be more solicitous about the
perversion of those things whose authority they knew to be more
generally received. Even the false apostles (were so called) on this
very account, because they imitated the apostles by means of their
falsification. In *as* far, then, as he might have amended what there
was to amend, if found corrupt, in *so* far did he firmly imply <span
id="fr_3608"></span>[3609](#fn_3608) that all was free from corruption
which he did not think required amendment. In short, <span
id="fr_3609"></span>[3610](#fn_3609) he simply amended what he thought
was corrupt; though, indeed, not even this justly, because it was not
really corrupt.  For if the (Gospels) of the apostles <span
id="fr_3610"></span>[3611](#fn_3610) have come down to us in their
integrity, whilst Luke’s, which is received amongst us, <span
id="fr_3611"></span>[3612](#fn_3611) so far accords with their rule as
to be on a par with them in permanency of reception in the churches, it
clearly follows that Luke’s Gospel also has come down to us in like
integrity until the sacrilegious treatment of Marcion. In short, when
Marcion laid hands on it, it then became diverse and hostile to the
Gospels of the apostles. I will therefore advise his followers, that
they either change these Gospels, however late to do so, into a
conformity with their own, whereby they may seem to be in agreement with
the apostolic writings (for they are daily retouching their work, as
daily they are convicted by us); or else that they blush for their
master, who stands self-condemned <span
id="fr_3612"></span>[3613](#fn_3612) either way—when once <span
id="fr_3613"></span>[3614](#fn_3613) he hands on the truth of the gospel
conscience smitten, or again <span id="fr_3614"></span>[3615](#fn_3614)
subverts it by shameless tampering. <span id="page_351">p. 351</span>
<span id="v.iv.v.v-Page_351"></span>Such are the summary arguments which
we use, when we take up arms <span id="fr_3615"></span>[3616](#fn_3615)
against heretics for the faith <span
id="fr_3616"></span>[3617](#fn_3616) of the gospel, maintaining both
that order of periods, which rules that a late date is the mark of
forgers, <span id="fr_3617"></span>[3618](#fn_3617) and that authority
of churches <span id="fr_3618"></span>[3619](#fn_3618) which lends
support to the tradition of the apostles; because truth must needs
precede the forgery, and proceed straight from those by whom it has been
handed on.
