<span id="iv.iii.xxxiii-p2"></span>But why dwell longer on the reverence
and sacred respect of Christians to the emperor, whom we cannot but look
up to as called by our Lord to his office?  So that on valid grounds I
might say Cæsar is more ours than yours, for our God has appointed him.
Therefore, as having this propriety in him, I do more than you for his
welfare, not merely because I ask it of Him who can give it, or because
I ask it as one who deserves to get it, but also because, in keeping the
majesty of Cæsar within due limits, and putting it under the Most High,
and making it less than divine, I commend him the more to the favour of
Deity, to whom I make him alone inferior. But I place him in subjection
to one I regard as more glorious than himself.  Never will I call the
emperor God, and that either because it is not in me to be guilty of
falsehood; or that I dare not turn him into ridicule; or that not even
himself will desire to have that high name applied to him. If he is but
a man, it is his interest as man to give God His higher place. Let him
think it enough to bear the name of emperor.  That, too, is a great name
of God’s giving. To call him God, is to rob him of his title. If he is
not a man, emperor he cannot be. Even when, amid the honours of a
triumph, he sits on that lofty chariot, he is reminded that he is only
human. A voice at his back keeps whispering in his ear, “Look behind
thee; remember thou art but a man.” And it only adds to his exultation,
that he shines with a glory so surpassing as to require an admonitory
reference to his condition. <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122) It
adds to his greatness that he needs such a reminiscence, lest he should
think himself divine.
