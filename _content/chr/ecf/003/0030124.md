id="iv.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.ix-p2"></span>In short, what patriarch, what prophet,
what Levite, or priest, or ruler, or at a later period what apostle, or
preacher of the gospel, or bishop, do you ever find the wearer of a
crown? <span id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406) I think not even the
temple of God itself was crowned; as neither was the ark of the
testament, nor the tabernacle of witness, nor the altar, nor the
candlestick crowned though certainly, both on that first solemnity of
the dedication, and in that second rejoicing for the restoration,
crowning would have been most suitable if it were worthy of God. But if
these things were figures of us (for we are temples of God, and altars,
and lights, and sacred vessels), this too they in figure set forth, that
the people of God ought not to be crowned. The reality must always
correspond with the image. If, perhaps, you object that Christ Himself
was crowned, to that you will get the brief reply: Be you too crowned,
as He was; you have full permission. Yet even that crown of insolent
ungodliness was not of any decree of the Jewish people. It was a device
of the Roman soldiers, taken from the practice of the world,—a practice
which the people of God never allowed either on the occasion of public
rejoicing or to gratify innate luxury: so they returned from the
Babylonish captivity with timbrels, and flutes, and psalteries, more
suitably than with crowns; and after eating and drinking, uncrowned,
they rose up to play. Neither would the account of the rejoicing nor the
exposure of the luxury have been silent touching the honour or dishonour
of the crown. Thus too Isaiah, as he says, “With timbrels, and
psalteries, and flutes they drink wine,” <span
id="fr_407"></span>[408](#fn_407) would have added “with crowns,” if
this practice had ever had place in the things of God.
