<span id="v.ix.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Catholic Doctrine of the
Trinity and Unity, Sometimes Called the Divine Economy, or Dispensation
of the Personal Relations of the Godhead.</span>

<span id="v.ix.ii-p2"></span>In the course of time, then, the Father
forsooth was born, and the Father suffered, God Himself, the Lord
Almighty, whom in their preaching they declare to be Jesus Christ. We,
however, as we indeed always have done (and more especially since we
have been better instructed by the Paraclete, who leads men indeed into
all truth), believe that there is one only God, but under the following
dispensation, or <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ix.ii-p2.1"></span>οἰκονομία</span> , as it is called, that this
one only God has also a Son, His Word, who proceeded <span
id="fr_7778"></span>[7779](#fn_7778) from Himself, by whom all things
were made, and without whom nothing was made. Him *we believe* to have
been sent by the Father into the Virgin, and to have been born of
her—being both Man and God, the Son of Man and the Son of God, and to
have been called by the name of Jesus Christ; *we believe* Him to have
suffered, died, and been buried, according to the Scriptures, and, after
He had been raised again by the Father and taken back to heaven, to be
sitting at the right hand of the Father, *and* that He will come to
judge the quick and the dead; who sent also from heaven from the Father,
according to His own promise, the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete, <span
id="fr_7779"></span>[7780](#fn_7779) the sanctifier of the faith of
those who believe in the Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost.
That this rule of faith has come down to us from the beginning of the
gospel, even before any of the older heretics, much more before Praxeas,
*a pretender* of yesterday, will be apparent both from the lateness of
date <span id="fr_7780"></span>[7781](#fn_7780) which marks all
heresies, and also from the absolutely novel character of our
new-fangled Praxeas. In this principle also we must henceforth find a
presumption of equal force against all heresies whatsoever—that whatever
is first is true, whereas that is spurious which is later in date. <span
id="fr_7781"></span>[7782](#fn_7781) But keeping this prescriptive rule
inviolate, still some opportunity must be given for reviewing (the
statements of heretics), with a view to the instruction and protection
of divers persons; were it only that it may not seem that each
perversion *of the truth* is condemned without examination, and simply
prejudged; <span id="fr_7782"></span>[7783](#fn_7782) especially in the
case of this heresy, which supposes itself to possess the pure truth, in
thinking that one cannot believe in One Only God in any other way than
by saying that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are the very
selfsame Person. As if in this way also one were not All, in that All
are of One, by unity (that is) of substance; while the mystery of the
dispensation <span id="fr_7783"></span>[7784](#fn_7783) is still
guarded, which distributes the Unity into a Trinity, placing in their
order <span id="fr_7784"></span>[7785](#fn_7784) the three *Persons*—the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost: three, however, not in
condition, <span id="fr_7785"></span>[7786](#fn_7785) but in
degree; <span id="fr_7786"></span>[7787](#fn_7786) not in substance, but
in form; not in power, but in aspect; <span
id="fr_7787"></span>[7788](#fn_7787) yet of one substance, and of one
condition, and of one power, inasmuch as He is one God, from whom these
degrees and forms and aspects are reckoned, under the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. <span
id="fr_7788"></span>[7789](#fn_7788) How they are susceptible of number
without division, will be shown as our treatise proceeds.

<span id="v.ix.ii-p3"></span> The Church afterwards applied this term
exclusively to the Holy Ghost. \[That is, the Nicene Creed made it
*technically* applicable to the Spirit, making the distinction marked
between the *generation* of the Word and the *procession* of the Holy
Ghost.\]
