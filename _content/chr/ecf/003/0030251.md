<span id="iv.xi.xlvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVII.—Dreams Variously Classified.
Some are God-Sent, as the Dreams of Nebuchadnezzar; Others Simply
Products of Nature.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xlvii-p2"></span>We declare, then, that dreams are
inflicted on us mainly by demons, although they sometimes turn out true
and favourable to us. When, however, with the deliberate aim after evil,
of which we have just spoken, they assume a flattering and captivating
style, they show themselves proportionately vain, and deceitful, and
obscure, and wanton, and impure. And no wonder that the images partake
of the character of the realities. But from God—who has promised,
indeed, “to pour out the grace of the Holy Spirit upon all flesh, and
has ordained that His servants and His handmaids should see visions as
well as utter prophecies” <span id="fr_1772"></span>[1773](#fn_1772)
—must all those visions be regarded as emanating, which may be compared
to the actual grace of God, as being honest, holy, prophetic, inspired,
instructive, inviting <span id="page_226">p. 226</span> <span
id="iv.xi.xlvii-Page_226"></span>to virtue, the bountiful nature of
which causes them to overflow even to the profane, since God, with grand
impartiality, “sends His showers and sunshine on the just and on the
unjust.” <span id="fr_1773"></span>[1774](#fn_1773) It was, indeed by an
inspiration from God that Nebuchadnezzar dreamt his dreams; <span
id="fr_1774"></span>[1775](#fn_1774) and almost the greater part of
mankind get their knowledge of God from dreams. Thus it is that, as the
mercy of God super-abounds to the heathen, so the temptation of the evil
one encounters the saints, from whom he never withdraws his malignant
efforts to steal over them as best he may in their very sleep, if unable
to assault them when they are awake. The third class of dreams will
consist of those which the soul itself apparently creates for itself
from an intense application to special circumstances. Now, inasmuch as
the soul cannot dream of its own accord (for even Epicharmus is of this
opinion), how can it become to itself the cause of any vision? Then must
this class of dreams be abandoned to the action of nature, reserving for
the soul, even when in the ecstatic condition, the power of enduring
whatever incidents befall it? Those, moreover, which evidently proceed
neither from God, nor from diabolical inspiration, nor from the soul,
being beyond the reach as well of ordinary expectation, usual
interpretation, or the possibility of being intelligibly related, will
have to be ascribed in a separate category to what is purely and simply
the ecstatic state and its peculiar conditions.
