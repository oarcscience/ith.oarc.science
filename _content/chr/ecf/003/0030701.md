<span id="v.xi.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.xi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Valentinus, Ptolemy and Secundus,
Heracleon.</span>

<span id="v.xi.iv-p2"></span>Valentinus the heretic, moreover,
introduced many fables. These I will retrench and briefly summarize. 
For he introduces the Pleroma and the thirty Æons. These Æons, moreover,
he explains in the way of syzygies, that is, conjugal unions <span
id="fr_8380"></span>[8381](#fn_8380) of some kind. For among the
first, <span id="fr_8381"></span>[8382](#fn_8381) he says, were
Depth <span id="fr_8382"></span>[8383](#fn_8382) and Silence; of these
proceeded Mind and Truth; out of whom burst the Word and Life; from
whom, again, were created Man <span id="fr_8383"></span>[8384](#fn_8383)
and the Church. But (these are not all); for of these last also
proceeded twelve Æons; from Speech, <span
id="fr_8384"></span>[8385](#fn_8384) moreover, and Life *proceeded*
other ten Æons: such is the Triacontad of Æons, which is made up in the
Pleroma of an ogdoad, a decad, and a duodecad. The thirtieth Æon,
moreover, willed to see the great Bythus; and, to see him, had the
hardihood to ascend into the upper regions; and not being capable of
seeing his magnitude, desponded, <span
id="fr_8385"></span>[8386](#fn_8385) and almost suffered dissolution,
had not some one,—he whom he calls Horos, to wit,—sent to invigorate
him, strengthened him by pronouncing the word “Iao.” <span
id="fr_8386"></span>[8387](#fn_8386) This Æon, moreover, which was thus
reduced to despondency, he calls Achamoth, (and says) that he was seized
with certain regretful passions, and out of his passions gave birth to
material essences. <span id="fr_8387"></span>[8388](#fn_8387) For he was
panic-stricken, he says, and terror-stricken, and overcome with sadness;
and of these passions he conceived and bare. Hence he made the heaven,
and the earth, and the sea, and whatever is in them: for which cause all
things made by him are infirm, and frail, and capable of falling, and
mortal, inasmuch as he himself was conceived and produced from
despondency.  He, however, originated this world <span
id="fr_8388"></span>[8389](#fn_8388) out of those material essences
which Achamoth, by his panic, or terror, or sadness, or sweat, had
supplied. For of his panic, he says, was made darkness; of his fear and
ignorance, the spirits of wickedness and malignity; of his sadness and
tears, the humidities of founts, the material essence of floods and
sea.  Christ, moreover, was sent by that First-Father who is Bythus. He,
moreover, was not in the substance of our flesh; but, bringing down from
heaven some spiritual body or other, passed through the Virgin Mary as
water through a pipe, neither receiving nor borrowing aught thence. The
resurrection of our present flesh he denies, but (maintains that) of
some sister-flesh. <span id="fr_8389"></span>[8390](#fn_8389) Of the Law
and the prophets some parts he approves, some he disapproves; that is,
he disapproves all in reprobating some. A Gospel of his own he likewise
has, beside these of ours.

<span id="v.xi.iv-p13"></span>After him arose the heretics Ptolemy and
Secundus, who agree throughout with Valentinus, differing only in the
following point: viz., whereas Valentinus had feigned but thirty Æons,
they have added several more; for they first added four, and
subsequently four more. And Valentine’s assertion, that it was the
thirtieth Æon which strayed out from the Pleroma, (as *falling* into
despondency,) they deny; for the one which desponded on account of
disappointed yearning to see the First-Father was not of the original
triacontad, they say.

<span id="v.xi.iv-p14"></span>There arose, besides, Heracleon, a
brother <span id="fr_8390"></span>[8391](#fn_8390) -heretic, whose
sentiments pair with Valentine’s; but, by some novelty of terminology,
he is desirous of seeming to differ in sentiment.  For he introduces the
notion that there existed first what he terms (a Monad); <span
id="fr_8391"></span>[8392](#fn_8391) and then out of that Monad (arose)
two, and then the <span id="page_653">p. 653</span> <span
id="v.xi.iv-Page_653"></span>rest of the Æons. Then he introduces the
whole *system of* Valentine.

<span id="v.xi.iv-p9"></span> Cf. *adv. Valent.* cc. x. xiv.  \[Routh
says that this IAO (see note 8) is wanting in the older editions. It was
borrowed from the *Adv. Valentin.* to eke out a defect.\]

<span id="fn_8387"></span>[652:8388](0030701.htm#fr_8387) <span
id="v.xi.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="v.xi.iv-p10"></span> Such appears to be the meaning of this
sentence as Oehler gives it.  But the text is here corrupt; and it seems
plain there must either be something lost relating to this “Achamoth,”
or else some capital error in the reading, or, thirdly, some gross and
unaccountable confusion in the writer: for the sentence as it stands is
wholly irreconcilable with what follows. It evidently makes “Achamoth”
identical with “the thirtieth Æon” above-named; and yet, without
introducing any fresh subject, the writer goes on to state that this
despondent Œon, who “conceived and bare,” was itself the offspring of
despondency, and made an infirm world out of the infirm materials which
“Achamoth” supposed it with. Now it is apparent from other sources—as,
for instance, from *Tert. adv. Valentin*, above referred to—that the
“thirtieth Æon” was supposed to be *female*, *Sophia* (Wisdom) by name,
and that she was said to be *the parent* of “Achamoth,” or “Enthymesis”
(see *adv. Valentin.* cc. ix. x. xi. xiv. xxv.), while “Achamoth”
herself appears by some accounts to be also called <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.xi.iv-p10.1"></span>κάτω Σοφία</span>. The
name “Achamoth” itself, which Tertullian (*adv. Valentin.* c. xiv. *ad
init.*) calls an “uninterpretable name,” is believed to be a
representation of a Hebrew word meaning “wisdom;” and hence, possibly,
some of the confusion may have arisen,—from a promiscuous use, namely,
of the titles “Achamoth” and “Sophia.” Moreover, it would appear that
some words lower down as to the production by “Achamoth” of “Demiurgus,”
must have dropped out. Unless these two omissions be supplied, the
passage is wholly unintelligible.  Can the fact that the Hebrew word
which “Achamoth” represents is a *fem. pl.* in any way explain this
confused medley, or help to reconcile conflicting accounts? The <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.xi.iv-p10.2"></span>ἄνω</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.xi.iv-p10.3"></span>κάτω Σοφία</span> seem to
point in some degree to some such solution of some of the existing
difficulties. “Iao,” again, is a word which has cause much perplexity.
Can it possibly be connected with <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xi.iv-p10.4"></span>ἰάομαι</span>, “to heal?” \[See note 8.\]

<span id="fn_8388"></span>[652:8389](0030701.htm#fr_8388) <span
id="v.xi.iv-p10.5"></span>

<span id="v.xi.iv-p11"></span> Mundum.

<span id="fn_8389"></span>[652:8390](0030701.htm#fr_8389) <span
id="v.xi.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="v.xi.iv-p12"></span> Oehler’s suggestion is to vary the
pointing so as to give this sense:  “The resurrection of this flesh he
denies. But of a sister-Law and prophets,” etc. But this seems even more
harsh than the other.

<span id="fn_8390"></span>[652:8391](0030701.htm#fr_8390) <span
id="v.xi.iv-p14.2"></span>

<span id="v.xi.iv-p15"></span> “Alter,” i.e., perhaps another *of the
same class*.

<span id="fn_8391"></span>[652:8392](0030701.htm#fr_8391) <span
id="v.xi.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="v.xi.iv-p16"></span> It seems almost necessary to supply some
word here; and as “Monade” follows, it seemed simple to supply “Monada.”
