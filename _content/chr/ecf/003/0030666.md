<span id="v.ix.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—The Son in Union with the Father
in the Creation of All Things. This Union of the Two in Co-Operation is
Not Opposed to the True Unity of God. It is Opposed Only to Praxeas’
Identification Theory.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xix-p2"></span>But this very declaration of His they will
hastily pervert into an argument of His *singleness*. “I have,” says He,
“stretched out the heaven alone.”  Undoubtedly *alone* as regards all
other powers; and He thus gives a premonitory evidence against the
conjectures of the heretics, who maintain that the world was constructed
by various angels and powers, who also make the Creator Himself to have
been either an angel or some subordinate agent sent to form external
things, such as the constituent parts of the world, but who was at the
same time ignorant *of the divine purpose*. If, now, it is in this sense
that He stretches out the heavens alone, how is it that these heretics
assume their position so perversely, as to render inadmissible the
singleness of that Wisdom which says, “When He prepared the heaven, I
was present with Him?” <span id="fr_7988"></span>[7989](#fn_7988) —even
though the apostle asks, “Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who
hath been His counsellor?” <span id="fr_7989"></span>[7990](#fn_7989)
meaning, of course, to except that wisdom which was present with
Him. <span id="fr_7990"></span>[7991](#fn_7990) In Him, at any rate, and
with Him, did (Wisdom) construct the universe, He not being ignorant of
what she was making. “Except Wisdom,” however, is a phrase of the same
sense exactly as “except the Son,” who is Christ, “the Wisdom and Power
of God,” <span id="fr_7991"></span>[7992](#fn_7991) according to the
apostle, who only knows the mind of the Father. “For who knoweth the
things that be in God, except the Spirit which is in Him?” <span
id="fr_7992"></span>[7993](#fn_7992) Not, observe, *without* Him. There
was therefore One who caused God to be not alone, except “alone” from
all other *gods*.  But (if we are to follow the heretics), the Gospel
itself will have to be rejected, because it tells us that all things
were made by God through the Word, without whom nothing was made. <span
id="fr_7993"></span>[7994](#fn_7993) And if I am not mistaken, there is
also another passage in which it is written:  “By the Word of the Lord
were the heavens made, and all the hosts of them by His Spirit.” <span
id="fr_7994"></span>[7995](#fn_7994) Now this Word, the Power of God and
the Wisdom of God, must be the very Son of God.  So that, if (He did)
all things by the Son, He must have stretched out the heavens by the
Son, and so not have stretched them out alone, except in the sense in
which He is “alone” (and apart) from all other gods. Accordingly He
says, concerning the Son, immediately afterwards: “Who else is it that
frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad, turning
wise men backward, and making their knowledge foolish, and confirming
the words <span id="fr_7995"></span>[7996](#fn_7995) of His Son?” <span
id="fr_7996"></span>[7997](#fn_7996) —as, for instance, when He said,
“This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him.” <span
id="fr_7997"></span>[7998](#fn_7997) By thus attaching the Son to
Himself, He becomes His own interpreter in what sense He stretched out
the heavens alone, meaning *alone with His Son*, even as He is one with
His Son. The utterance, therefore, will be in like manner the Son’s, “I
have stretched out the heavens alone,” <span
id="fr_7998"></span>[7999](#fn_7998) because *by the Word* were the
heavens established. <span id="fr_7999"></span>[8000](#fn_7999)
Inasmuch, then, as the heaven was prepared when Wisdom was present in
the Word, and since all things were made by the Word, it is quite
correct to say that even the Son stretched out the heaven alone, because
He alone ministered to the Father’s work. It must also be He who says,
“I am the First, and to all futurity I AM.” <span
id="fr_8000"></span>[8001](#fn_8000) The Word, no doubt, was before all
things. “In the beginning was the Word;” <span
id="fr_8001"></span>[8002](#fn_8001) and in that beginning He was sent
forth <span id="fr_8002"></span>[8003](#fn_8002) by the Father. The
Father, however, has no beginning, as proceeding from none; nor can He
be seen, since He was not begotten. He who has always been alone could
never have had order or rank.  Therefore, if they have determined that
the Father and the Son must be regarded as one and the same, for the
express purpose of vindicating the unity of God, that unity of His is
preserved intact; for He is one, and yet He has a Son, who is equally
with Himself comprehended in the same Scriptures. Since they are
unwilling to allow that the Son is *a distinct Person*, second from the
Father, lest, being thus second, He should cause two Gods to be spoken
of, we have shown above <span id="fr_8003"></span>[8004](#fn_8003) that
Two are actually described in Scripture as God and Lord. And to pre<span
id="page_615">p. 615</span> <span id="v.ix.xix-Page_615"></span>vent
their being offended at this fact, we give a reason why they are not
said to be two Gods and two Lords, but that they are two as Father and
Son; and this not by severance of their substance, but from the
dispensation wherein we declare the Son to be undivided and inseparable
from the Father,—distinct in degree, not in state. And although, when
named apart, He is called God, He does not thereby constitute two Gods,
but one; and that from the very circumstance that He is entitled to be
called God, from His union with the Father.
