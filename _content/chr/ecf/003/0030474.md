<span id="v.v.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Hermogenes Coquets with His Own
Argument, as If Rather Afraid of It. After Investing Matter with Divine
Qualities, He Tries to Make It Somehow Inferior to God.</span>

<span id="v.v.v-p2"></span>But God is God, and Matter is Matter. As if a
mere difference in their names prevented equality, <span
id="fr_6177"></span>[6178](#fn_6177) when an identity of condition is
claimed for them! Grant that their nature is <span id="page_480">p.
480</span> <span id="v.v.v-Page_480"></span>different; assume, too, that
their form is not identical,—what matters it so long as their absolute
state have but one mode? <span id="fr_6178"></span>[6179](#fn_6178) God
is unborn; is not Matter also unborn? God ever exists; is not Matter,
too, ever existent? Both are without beginning; both are without end;
both are the authors of the universe—both He who created it, and the
Matter of which He made it. For it is impossible that Matter should not
be regarded as the author <span id="fr_6179"></span>[6180](#fn_6179) of
all things, when the universe is composed of it. What answer will he
give? Will he say that Matter is not then comparable with God as soon
as <span id="fr_6180"></span>[6181](#fn_6180) it has something belonging
to God; since, by not having total (divinity), it cannot correspond to
the whole extent of the comparison? But what more has he reserved for
God, that he should not seem to have accorded to Matter the full amount
of the Deity? <span id="fr_6181"></span>[6182](#fn_6181) He says in
reply, that even though this is the prerogative of Matter, both the
authority and the substance of God must remain intact, by virtue of
which He is regarded as the sole and prime Author, as well as the Lord
of all things.  Truth, however, maintains the unity of God in such a way
as to insist that whatever belongs to God Himself belongs to Him alone.
For so will it belong to Himself if it belong to Him alone; and
therefore it will be impossible that another god should be admitted,
when it is permitted to no other being to possess anything of God. Well,
then, you say, we ourselves at that rate possess nothing of God. But
indeed we do, and shall continue to do—only it is from Him that we
receive it, and not from ourselves. For we shall be even gods, if we,
shall deserve to be among those of whom He declared, “I have said, Ye
are gods,” <span id="fr_6182"></span>[6183](#fn_6182) and, “God standeth
in the congregation of the gods.” <span
id="fr_6183"></span>[6184](#fn_6183) But this comes of His own grace,
not from any property in us, because it is He alone who can make gods.
The property of Matter, however, he <span
id="fr_6184"></span>[6185](#fn_6184) makes to be that which it has in
common with God. Otherwise, if it received from God the property which
belongs to God,—I mean its attribute <span
id="fr_6185"></span>[6186](#fn_6185) of eternity—one might then even
suppose that it both possesses an attribute in common with God, and yet
at the same time is not God. But what inconsistency is it for him <span
id="fr_6186"></span>[6187](#fn_6186) to allow that there is a conjoint
possession of an attribute with God, and also to wish that what he does
not refuse to Matter should be, after all, the exclusive privilege of
God!
