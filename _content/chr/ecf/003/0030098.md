<span id="iv.v.xiv-p2"></span>Having sufficiently established the charge
of idolatry, which alone ought to be reason enough for our giving up the
shows, let us now *ex abundanti* look at the subject in another way, for
the sake of those especially who keep themselves comfortable in the
thought that the abstinence we urge is not in so many words enjoined, as
if in the condemnation of the lusts of the world there was not involved
a sufficient declaration against all these amusements. For as there is a
lust of money, or rank, or eating, or impure enjoyment, or glory, so
there is also a lust of pleasure. But the show is just a sort of
pleasure. I think, then, that under the general designation of lusts,
pleasures are included; in like manner, under the general idea of
pleasures, <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> <span
id="iv.v.xiv-Page_86"></span>you have as a specific class the “shows.”
But we have spoken already of how it is with the places of exhibition,
that they are not polluting in themselves, but owing to the things that
are done in them from which they imbibe impurity, and then spirt it
again on others.
