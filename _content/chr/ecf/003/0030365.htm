<p class="c19"><a name="v.iv.iii.xxi-p2"></A>Similarly on other points also, you reproach Him with fickleness and instability for contradictions in His commandments, such as that He forbade work to be done on Sabbath-days, and yet at the siege of Jericho ordered the ark to be carried round the walls during eight days; in other words, of course, actually on a Sabbath. You do not, however, consider the law of the Sabbath: they are human works, not divine, which it prohibits.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2958"></A><A HREF="#fn_2958"><FONT SIZE="1">2959</FONT></A>
 For it says, &#8220;Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of <A NAME="page_314"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 314</FONT></A> <a name="v.iv.iii.xxi-Page_314"></A>the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work.&#8221; What work?&#160; Of course your own. The conclusion is, that from the Sabbath-day He removes those works which He had before enjoined for the six days, that is, your own works; in other words, human works of daily life. Now, the carrying around of the ark is evidently not an ordinary daily duty, nor yet a human one; but a rare and a sacred work, and, as being then ordered by the direct precept of God, a divine one. And I might fully explain what this signified, were it not a tedious process to open out the forms&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2959"></A><A HREF="#fn_2959"><FONT SIZE="1">2960</FONT></A>
 of all the Creator&#146;s proofs, which you would, moreover, probably refuse to allow. It is more to the point, if you be confuted on plain matters&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2960"></A><A HREF="#fn_2960"><FONT SIZE="1">2961</FONT></A>
 by the simplicity of truth rather than curious reasoning. Thus, in the present instance, there is a clear distinction respecting the Sabbath&#146;s prohibition of human labours, not divine ones. Accordingly, the man who went and gathered sticks on the Sabbath-day was punished with death. For it was his own work which he did; and this&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2961"></A><A HREF="#fn_2961"><FONT SIZE="1">2962</FONT></A>
 the law forbade. They, however, who on the Sabbath carried the ark round Jericho, did it with impunity. For it was not their own work, but God&#146;s, which they executed, and that too, from His express commandment.</p>
