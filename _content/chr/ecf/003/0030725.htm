<p class="c19"><a name="vi.iii.iii-p2"></A>Mindful of this declaration as of a conclusive prescript, we nevertheless <i>proceed to</i> treat <i>the question</i>, &#8220;How <i>foolish</i> and <i>impossible</i> it is to be formed anew by water. In what respect, pray, has this material substance merited an office of so high dignity?&#8221; The authority, I suppose, of the liquid element has to be examined.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8550"></A><A HREF="#fn_8550"><FONT SIZE="1">8551</FONT></A>
 This&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8551"></A><A HREF="#fn_8551"><FONT SIZE="1">8552</FONT></A>
 however, is found in abundance, and that from the very beginning. For <i>water</i> is one of those things which, before all the furnishing of the world, were quiescent with God in a yet unshapen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8552"></A><A HREF="#fn_8552"><FONT SIZE="1">8553</FONT></A>
 state. &#8220;In the first beginning,&#8221; saith <i>Scripture</i>, &#8220;God made the heaven and the earth. But the earth was invisible, and unorganized,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8553"></A><A HREF="#fn_8553"><FONT SIZE="1">8554</FONT></A>
 and darkness was over the abyss; and the Spirit of the Lord was hovering&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8554"></A><A HREF="#fn_8554"><FONT SIZE="1">8555</FONT></A>
 over the waters.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8555"></A><A HREF="#fn_8555"><FONT SIZE="1">8556</FONT></A>
 The first thing, O man, which you have to venerate, is the <i>age</i> of the waters in that their substance is ancient; the second, their <i>dignity</i>, in that they were the seat of the Divine Spirit, more pleasing <i>to Him</i>, no doubt, than all the other then existing elements. For the darkness was total thus far, shapeless, without the ornament of stars; and the abyss gloomy; and the earth unfurnished; and the heaven unwrought: water&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8556"></A><A HREF="#fn_8556"><FONT SIZE="1">8557</FONT></A>
 alone&#8212;always a perfect, gladsome, simple material substance, pure in itself&#8212;supplied a worthy vehicle to God.&#160; What <i>of the fact</i> that waters were in some way the regulating powers by which the disposition of the world thenceforward was constituted by God?&#160; For the suspension of the celestial firmament in the midst He caused by &#8220;dividing the waters;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8557"></A><A HREF="#fn_8557"><FONT SIZE="1">8558</FONT></A>
 the suspension of &#8220;the dry land&#8221; He accomplished by &#8220;separating the waters.&#8221; After the world had been hereupon set in order through <i>its</i> elements, when inhabitants were given it, &#8220;the waters&#8221; were the first to receive the precept &#8220;to bring forth living creatures.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8558"></A><A HREF="#fn_8558"><FONT SIZE="1">8559</FONT></A>
 Water was the first to produce that which had life, that it might be no wonder in baptism if waters know how to give life.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8559"></A><A HREF="#fn_8559"><FONT SIZE="1">8560</FONT></A>
 For was not the work of fashioning man himself also achieved with the aid of waters?&#160; Suitable material is found in the <i>earth</i>, yet not apt for the purpose unless it be moist and juicy; which (earth) &#8220;the waters,&#8221; separated the fourth day before into their own place, temper with their remaining moisture to a clayey consistency. If, from that time onward, I go forward in recounting universally, or at more length, the evidences of the &#8220;authority&#8221; of this element which I can adduce to show how great is its power or its grace; how many ingenious devices, how many functions, how useful an instrumentality, it affords the world, I fear I may seem to have collected rather the praises of water than the reasons of baptism; although I should <i>thereby</i> teach all the more fully, that it is not to be doubted that God has made the material substance which He has disposed throughout all His products&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8560"></A><A HREF="#fn_8560"><FONT SIZE="1">8561</FONT></A>
 and works, obey Him also in His own peculiar sacraments; that the <i>material substance</i> which governs terrestrial life acts as agent likewise in the celestial.</p>
