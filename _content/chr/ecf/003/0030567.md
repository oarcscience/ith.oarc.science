<span id="v.vii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—The True Functions of the Soul.
Christ Assumed It in His Perfect Human Nature, Not to Reveal and Explain
It, But to Save It. Its Resurrection with the Body Assured by
Christ.</span>

<span id="v.vii.xii-p2"></span>Well, now, let it be granted that the
soul is made apparent by the flesh, <span
id="fr_7103"></span>[7104](#fn_7103) on the assumption that it was
evidently necessary <span id="fr_7104"></span>[7105](#fn_7104) that it
should be made apparent in some way or other, that is, as being
incognizable to itself and to us: there is still an absurd distinction
in this *hypothesis*, which implies that we are ourselves separate from
our soul, when all that we are is soul. Indeed, <span
id="fr_7105"></span>[7106](#fn_7105) without the soul we are nothing;
there is not even the name of a human being, only that of a carcase. If,
then, we are ignorant of the soul, it is in fact the soul that is
ignorant of itself. Thus the only remaining question left for us to look
into is, whether the soul was in this matter so ignorant of itself that
it became known in any way it could. <span
id="fr_7106"></span>[7107](#fn_7106) The soul, in my opinion, <span
id="fr_7107"></span>[7108](#fn_7107) is sensual. <span
id="fr_7108"></span>[7109](#fn_7108) Nothing, therefore, pertaining to
the soul is unconnected with sense, <span
id="fr_7109"></span>[7110](#fn_7109) nothing pertaining to sense is
unconnected with the soul. <span id="fr_7110"></span>[7111](#fn_7110)
And if I may use the expression for the sake of emphasis, I would say,
“*Animœ anima sensus est*”—“Sense is the soul’s very soul.”  Now, since
it is the soul that imparts the faculty of perception <span
id="fr_7111"></span>[7112](#fn_7111) to all (that have sense), and since
it is itself that perceives the very senses, not to say properties, of
them all, how is it likely that it did not itself receive sense as its
own natural constitution? Whence is it to know what is necessary for
itself under given circumstances, from the very necessity of natural
causes, if it knows not its own property, and what is necessary for it?
To recognise this indeed is within the competence of every soul; it has,
I mean, a practical knowledge of itself, without which knowledge of
itself no soul could possibly have exercised its own functions. <span
id="fr_7112"></span>[7113](#fn_7112) I suppose, too, that it is
especially suitable that man, the only rational animal, should have been
furnished with such a soul as would make him the rational animal, itself
being pre-eminently rational. Now, how can that soul which makes man a
rational animal be itself rational if it be itself ignorant of its
rationality, being ignorant of its own very self? So far, however, is it
from being ignorant, that it knows its own Author, its own Master, and
its own condition. Before it learns anything about God, it names the
name of God. Before it acquires any knowledge of His judgment, it
professes to commend itself to God. There is nothing one oftener hears
of than that there is no hope after death; and yet what imprecations or
deprecations does not the soul use according as the man dies after a
well or ill spent life! These reflections are more fully pursued in a
short treatise which we have written, “*On the Testimony of the
Soul*.” <span id="fr_7113"></span>[7114](#fn_7113) Besides, if the soul
was ignorant of itself from the beginning, there is nothing it
could <span id="fr_7114"></span>[7115](#fn_7114) have learnt of Christ
except its own quality. <span id="fr_7115"></span>[7116](#fn_7115) It
was not its own form that it learnt of Christ, but its salvation. For
this cause did the Son of God descend and take on Him a soul, not that
the soul might discover itself in Christ, but Christ in itself. For its
salvation is endangered, not by its being ignorant of itself, but of the
word of God. “The life,” says He, “was manifested,” <span
id="fr_7116"></span>[7117](#fn_7116) not the soul. And again, “I am come
to save the soul.” He did not say, “to explain” <span
id="fr_7117"></span>[7118](#fn_7117) it. We could not know, of
course, <span id="fr_7118"></span>[7119](#fn_7118) that the soul,
although an invisible essence, is born and dies, unless it were
exhibited corporeally. We certainly were ignorant that it was to rise
again with the flesh. This is the truth which it will be found was
manifested by Christ. But even this He did not manifest in Himself in a
different way than in some Lazarus, whose flesh was no more composed of
soul <span id="fr_7119"></span>[7120](#fn_7119) than his soul was of
flesh. <span id="fr_7120"></span>[7121](#fn_7120) What further
knowledge, therefore, have we received of the structure <span
id="fr_7121"></span>[7122](#fn_7121) of the soul which we were ignorant
of before?  What invisible part was there belonging to it which wanted
to be made visible by the flesh?
