<p class="c19"><a name="iv.iii.xliii-p2"></A>I will confess, however, without hesitation, that there are some who in a sense may complain of Christians that they are a sterile race:&#160; as, for instance, pimps, and panders, and bath-suppliers; assassins, and poisoners, and sorcerers; soothsayers, too, diviners, and astrologers. But it is a noble fruit of Christians, that they have no fruits for such as these.&#160; And yet, whatever loss your interests suffer from the religion we profess, the protection you have from us makes amply up for it. What value do you set on persons, I do not here urge who deliver you from demons, I do not urge who for your sakes present prayers before the throne of the true God, for perhaps you have no belief in that&#8212;but from whom you can have nothing to fear?</p>
