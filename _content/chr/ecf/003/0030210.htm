<p class="c30"><a name="iv.xi.vi-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="iv.xi.vi-p1.1"></A>Chapter VI.&#8212;The Arguments of the Platonists for the Soul&#146;s Incorporeality, Opposed, Perhaps Frivolously.</span></p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="iv.xi.vi-p2"></A>These conclusions the Platonists disturb more by subtilty than by truth. Every body, they say, has necessarily either an animate nature&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1527"></A><A HREF="#fn_1527"><FONT SIZE="1">1528</FONT></A>
 or an inanimate one.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1528"></A><A HREF="#fn_1528"><FONT SIZE="1">1529</FONT></A>
 If it has the inanimate nature, it receives motion externally to itself; if the animate one, internally. Now the soul receives motion neither externally nor internally: not externally, since it has not the inanimate nature; nor internally, because it is itself rather the giver of motion to the body. It evidently, then, is not a bodily substance, inasmuch as it receives motion neither way, according to the nature and law of corporeal substances. Now, what first surprises us here, is the unsuitableness of a definition which appeals to objects which have no affinity with the soul. For it is impossible for the soul to be called either an animate body or an inanimate one, inasmuch as it is the soul itself which makes the body either animate, if it be present to it, or else inanimate, if it be absent from it.&#160; That, therefore, which produces a result, cannot itself be the result, so as to be entitled to the designation of an animate thing or an inanimate one. The soul is so called in respect of its own substance. If, then, that which is the soul admits not of being called an animate body or an inanimate one, how can it challenge comparison with the nature and law of animate and inanimate bodies? Furthermore, since it is characteristic of a body to be moved externally by something else, and as we have already shown that the soul receives motion from some other thing when it is swayed (from the outside, of course, by something else) by prophetic influence or by madness, therefore I must be right in regarding that as bodily substance which, according to the examples we have quoted, is moved by some other object from without. Now, if to receive motion from some other thing is characteristic of a body, how much more is it so to impart motion to something else!&#160; But the soul moves the body, all whose efforts are apparent externally, and from without. It is the soul which gives motion to the feet for walking, and to the hands for touching, and to the eyes for sight, and to the tongue for speech&#8212;a sort of internal image which moves and animates the surface. Whence could accrue such power to the soul, if it were incorporeal? How could an unsubstantial thing propel solid objects? But in what way do the senses in man seem to be divisible into the corporeal and the intellectual classes? They tell us that the qualities of things corporeal, such as earth and fire, are indicated by the bodily senses&#8212;of touch and sight; whilst (the qualities) of incorporeal things&#8212;for instance, benevolence and malignity&#8212;are <A NAME="page_186"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 186</FONT></A> <a name="iv.xi.vi-Page_186"></A>discovered by the intellectual faculties. And from this (they deduce what is to them) the manifest conclusion, that the soul is incorporeal, its properties being comprehended by the perception not of bodily organs, but of intellectual faculties.&#160; Well, (I shall be much surprised) if I do not at once cut away the very ground on which their argument stands.&#160; For I show them how incorporeal things are commonly submitted to the bodily senses&#8212;sound, for instance, to the organ of hearing; colour, to the organ of sight; smell, to the olfactory organ.&#160; And, just as in these instances, the soul likewise has its contact with&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1529"></A><A HREF="#fn_1529"><FONT SIZE="1">1530</FONT></A>
 the body; not to say that the incorporeal objects are reported to us through the bodily organs, for the express reason that they come into contact with the said organs. Inasmuch, then, as it is evident that even incorporeal objects are embraced and comprehended by corporeal ones, why should not the soul, which is corporeal, be equally comprehended and understood by incorporeal faculties? It is thus certain that their argument fails. Among their more conspicuous arguments will be found this, that in their judgment every bodily substance is nourished by bodily substances; whereas the soul, as being an incorporeal essence, is nourished by incorporeal aliments&#8212;for instance, by the studies of wisdom. But even this ground has no stability in it, since Soranus, who is a most accomplished authority in medical science, affords us as answer, when he asserts that the soul is even nourished by corporeal aliments; that in fact it is, when failing and weak, actually refreshed oftentimes by food. Indeed, when deprived of all food, does not the soul entirely remove from the body? Soranus, then, after discoursing about the soul in the amplest manner, filling four volumes with his dissertations, and after weighing well all the opinions of the philosophers, defends the corporeality of the soul, although in the process he has robbed it of its immortality. For to all men it is not given to believe the truth which Christians are privileged to hold. As, therefore, Soranus has shown us from facts that the soul is nourished by corporeal aliments, let the philosopher (adopt a similar mode of proof, and) show that it is sustained by an incorporeal food. But the fact is, that no one has even been able to quench this man&#146;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1530"></A><A HREF="#fn_1530"><FONT SIZE="1">1531</FONT></A>
 doubts and difficulties about the condition of the soul with the honey-water of Plato&#146;s subtle eloquence, nor to surfeit them with the crumbs from the minute nostrums of Aristotle. But what is to become of the souls of all those robust barbarians, which have had no nurture of philosopher&#146;s lore indeed, and yet are strong in untaught practical wisdom, and which although very starvelings in philosophy, without your Athenian academies and porches, and even the prison of Socrates, do yet contrive to live? For it is not the soul&#146;s actual substance which is benefited by the aliment of learned study, but only its conduct and discipline; such ailment contributing nothing to increase its bulk, but only to enhance its grace. It is, moreover, a happy circumstance that the Stoics affirm that even the arts have corporeality; since at the rate the soul too must be corporeal, since it is commonly supposed to be nourished by the arts.&#160; Such, however, is the enormous preoccupation of the philosophic mind, that it is generally unable to see straight before it. Hence (the story of) Thales falling into the well.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1531"></A><A HREF="#fn_1531"><FONT SIZE="1">1532</FONT></A>
 It very commonly, too, through not understanding even its own opinions, suspects a failure of its own health. Hence (the story of) Chrysippus and the hellebore. Some such hallucination, I take it, must have occurred to him, when he asserted that two bodies could not possibly be contained in one: he must have kept out of mind and sight the case of those pregnant women who, day after day, bear not one body, but even two and three at a time, within the embrace of a single womb. One finds likewise, in the records of the civil law, the instance of a certain Greek woman who gave birth to a quint&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1532"></A><A HREF="#fn_1532"><FONT SIZE="1">1533</FONT></A>
 of children, the mother of all these at one parturition, the manifold parent of a single brood, the prolific produce from a single womb, who, guarded by so many bodies&#8212;I had almost said, a people&#8212;was herself no less then the sixth person! The whole creation testifies how that those bodies which are naturally destined to issue from bodies, are already (included) in that from which they proceed. Now that which proceeds from some other thing must needs be second to it. Nothing, however, proceeds out of another thing except by the process of generation; but then they are two (things).</p>
