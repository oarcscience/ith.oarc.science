id="v.ix.i-p8.1"></span>Chapter I.—Satan’s Wiles Against the Truth. How
They Take the Form of the Praxean Heresy. Account of the Publication of
This Heresy.</span>

<span id="v.ix.i-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.ix.i-p9.1"></span>In</span> various ways has the devil rivalled
and resisted the truth.  Sometimes his aim has been to destroy the truth
by defending it. He maintains that there is one only Lord, the Almighty
Creator of the world, in order that out of this *doctrine of the* unity
he may fabricate a heresy. He says that the Father Himself came down
into the Virgin, was Himself born of her, Himself suffered, indeed was
Himself Jesus Christ. Here the *old* serpent has fallen out with
himself, since, when he tempted Christ after John’s baptism, he
approached Him as “the Son of God;” surely intimating that God had a
Son, even on the testimony of the very Scriptures, out of which he was
at the moment forging his temptation: “If thou be the Son of God,
command that these stones be made bread.” <span
id="fr_7767"></span>[7768](#fn_7767) Again:  “If thou be the Son of God,
cast thyself down from hence; <span id="fr_7768"></span>[7769](#fn_7768)
for it is written, He shall give His angels charge concerning
thee”—referring no doubt, to the Father—“and in their hands they shall
bear thee up, that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.” <span
id="fr_7769"></span>[7770](#fn_7769) Or perhaps, after all, he was only
reproaching the Gospels with a lie, saying in fact: “Away with Matthew;
away with Luke! *Why heed their words*? In spite of them, *I declare*
that it was God Himself that I approached; it was the Almighty Himself
that I tempted face to face; and it was for no other purpose than to
tempt Him that I approached Him. If, on the contrary, it had been *only*
the Son of God, most likely I should never have condescended to deal
with Him.” However, he is himself a liar from the beginning, <span
id="fr_7770"></span>[7771](#fn_7770) and whatever man he instigates in
his own way; as, for instance, Praxeas. For *he* was the first to import
into Rome from Asia this kind of heretical pravity, a man in other
respects of restless disposition, and above all inflated with the pride
of confessorship simply and solely because he had to bear for a short
time the annoyance of a prison; on which occasion, even “if he had given
his body to be burned, it would have profited him nothing,” not having
the love of God, <span id="fr_7771"></span>[7772](#fn_7771) whose very
gifts he has resisted and destroyed.  For after the Bishop of Rome <span
id="fr_7772"></span>[7773](#fn_7772) had acknowledged the prophetic
gifts of Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla, and, in consequence of the
acknowledgment, had bestowed his peace <span
id="fr_7773"></span>[7774](#fn_7773) on the churches of Asia and
Phrygia, *he*, by importunately urging false accusations against the
prophets themselves and their churches, and insisting on the authority
of the bishop’s predecessors in the see, compelled him to recall the
pacific letter which he had issued, as well as to desist from his
purpose of acknowledging the *said* gifts. By this Praxeas did a twofold
service for the devil at Rome:  he drove away prophecy, and he brought
in heresy; he put to flight the Paraclete, and he crucified the Father. 
Praxeas’ tares had been moreover sown, and had produced their fruit here
also, <span id="fr_7774"></span>[7775](#fn_7774) while many <span
id="page_598">p. 598</span> <span id="v.ix.i-Page_598"></span>were
asleep in their simplicity of doctrine; but these tares actually seemed
to have been plucked up, having been discovered and exposed by him whose
agency God was pleased to employ.  Indeed, *Praxeas* had deliberately
resumed his old (true) faith, teaching it after his renunciation of
error; and there is his own handwriting in evidence remaining among the
carnally-minded, <span id="fr_7775"></span>[7776](#fn_7775) in whose
society the transaction then took place; afterwards nothing was heard of
him. We indeed, on our part, subsequently withdrew from the
carnally-minded on our acknowledgment and maintenance of the
Paraclete. <span id="fr_7776"></span>[7777](#fn_7776) But the tares *of
Praxeas* had then everywhere shaken out their seed, which having lain
hid for some while, with its vitality concealed under a mask, has now
broken out with fresh life. But again shall it be rooted up, if the Lord
will, even now; but if not now, in the day when all bundles of tares
shall be gathered together, and along with every other stumbling-block
shall be burnt up with unquenchable fire. <span

<span id="v.ix.i-p3"></span> The error of Praxeas appears to have
originated in anxiety to maintain the unity of God; which, he thought,
could only be done by saying that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost were
one and the same. He contended, therefore, according to Tertullian, that
the Father himself descended into the virgin, was born of her, suffered,
and was in a word Jesus Christ. From the most startling of the
deductions from Praxeas’ general theory, his opponents gave him and his
followers the name of *Patripassians*; from another point in his
teaching they were called *Monarchians*. \[Probable date not earlier

are led to conclude that it was *Carthage*.”—<span class="sc"><span

<span id="v.ix.i-p19"></span> \[This statement may only denote a
withdrawal from the communion of the Bishop of Rome, like that of
Cyprian afterwards. That prelate had stultified himself and broken faith
with Tertullian; but, it does not, necessarily, as Bp. Bull too easily
concludes, define his ultimate separation from his own bishop and the
North-African church.\]
