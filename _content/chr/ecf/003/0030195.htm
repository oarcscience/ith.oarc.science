<p class="c19"><a name="iv.ix.xiv-p2"></A>Learn now (over and above the immediate question) the clue to your error.&#160; We affirm, <i>two</i> characters of the Christ demonstrated by the prophets, and as many <i>advents</i> of His forenoted:&#160; one, in humility (of course the first), when He has to be led &#8220;as a sheep for a victim; and, as a lamb voiceless before the shearer, so He opened not His mouth,&#8221; not even in His aspect comely.&#160; For &#8220;we have announced,&#8221; says <i>the prophet</i>, &#8220;concerning Him, (He is) as a little child, as a root in a thirsty land; and there was not in Him attractiveness or glory. And we saw Him, and He had not attractiveness or grace; but His mien was unhonoured, deficient in comparison of the sons of men,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1444"></A><A HREF="#fn_1444"><FONT SIZE="1">1445</FONT></A>
 &#8220;a man <i>set</i> in the plague,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1445"></A><A HREF="#fn_1445"><FONT SIZE="1">1446</FONT></A>
 and knowing how to bear infirmity:&#8221; to wit as having been set by the Father &#8220;for a stone of offence,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1446"></A><A HREF="#fn_1446"><FONT SIZE="1">1447</FONT></A>
 and &#8220;made a little lower&#8221; by Him &#8220;than angels,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1447"></A><A HREF="#fn_1447"><FONT SIZE="1">1448</FONT></A>
 He pronounces Himself &#8220;a worm, and not a man, an ignominy of man, and <i>the</i> refuse of <i>the</i> People.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1448"></A><A HREF="#fn_1448"><FONT SIZE="1">1449</FONT></A>
 Which evidences of ignobility suit the <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ix.xiv-p7.4"></A>First Advent</span>, just as those of sublimity do the <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ix.xiv-p7.5"></A>Second</span>; when He shall be made no longer &#8220;a stone of offence nor a rock of scandal,&#8221; but &#8220;the highest corner-stone,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1449"></A><A HREF="#fn_1449"><FONT SIZE="1">1450</FONT></A>
 after reprobation (on earth) taken up (into heaven) and raised sublime for the purpose of consummation,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1450"></A><A HREF="#fn_1450"><FONT SIZE="1">1451</FONT></A>
 and that &#8220;rock&#8221;&#8212;so we must admit&#8212;which is read of in Daniel as forecut from a mount, which shall crush and crumble the image of secular kingdoms.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1451"></A><A HREF="#fn_1451"><FONT SIZE="1">1452</FONT></A>
 Of which second advent of the same (Christ) Daniel has said: &#8220;And, behold, as it were a Son of man, coming with the clouds of the heaven, came unto the Ancient of days, and was present in His sight; and they who were standing by led (Him) unto Him. And there was given Him royal power; and all nations of the earth, according to their race, and all glory, shall serve Him: and His power <i>is</i> eternal, which shall not be taken away, and His kingdom <i>one</i> which shall not be corrupted.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1452"></A><A HREF="#fn_1452"><FONT SIZE="1">1453</FONT></A>
 Then, assuredly, is He to have an honourable mien, and a grace not &#8220;deficient more than the sons of men;&#8221; for (He will then be) &#8220;blooming in beauty in comparison with the sons of men.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1453"></A><A HREF="#fn_1453"><FONT SIZE="1">1454</FONT></A>
 &#8220;Grace,&#8221; says <i>the Psalmist</i>, &#8220;hath been outpoured in Thy lips: wherefore God hath blessed Thee unto eternity. Gird Thee Thy sword around Thy thigh, most potent in Thy bloom and beauty!&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1454"></A><A HREF="#fn_1454"><FONT SIZE="1">1455</FONT></A>
 while the Father withal afterwards, after making Him somewhat lower than angels, &#8220;crowned Him with glory and honour and subjected all <i>things</i> beneath His feet.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1455"></A><A HREF="#fn_1455"><FONT SIZE="1">1456</FONT></A>
 And then shall they &#8220;learn to know Him whom they pierced, and shall beat their breasts tribe by tribe;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1456"></A><A HREF="#fn_1456"><FONT SIZE="1">1457</FONT></A>
 of course because in days bygone they did <i>not</i> know Him when conditioned in the humility of human estate. Jeremiah says: &#8220;He is a human being, and who will learn to know Him?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1457"></A><A HREF="#fn_1457"><FONT SIZE="1">1458</FONT></A>
 because, &#8220;His nativity,&#8221; says Isaiah, &#8220;who shall declare?&#8221; So, too, in Zechariah, in His own person, nay, in the very mystery&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1458"></A><A HREF="#fn_1458"><FONT SIZE="1">1459</FONT></A>
 of His name withal, the most true Priest of the Father, His own&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1459"></A><A HREF="#fn_1459"><FONT SIZE="1">1460</FONT></A>
 Christ, is delineated in a twofold garb with reference to the <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ix.xiv-p18.1"></A>two advents</span>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1460"></A><A HREF="#fn_1460"><FONT SIZE="1">1461</FONT></A>
 First, He was clad in &#8220;sordid attire,&#8221; that is, in the indignity of passible and mortal flesh, when the devil, withal, was opposing himself to Him&#8212;the instigator, to wit, of Judas the traitor&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1461"></A><A HREF="#fn_1461"><FONT SIZE="1">1462</FONT></A>
&#8212;who even after His baptism had tempted Him.&#160; In the next place, He was stripped of His former sordid raiment, and adorned with a garment down to the foot, and with a turban and a clean mitre, that is, (with the garb) of the <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ix.xiv-p20.3"></A>second advent</span>; since He is demonstrated as having attained &#8220;glory and honour.&#8221; Nor <A NAME="page_173"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 173</FONT></A> <a name="iv.ix.xiv-Page_173"></A>will you be able to say that the man (there depicted) is &#8220;the son of Jozadak,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1462"></A><A HREF="#fn_1462"><FONT SIZE="1">1463</FONT></A>
 who was never at all clad in a sordid garment, but was always adorned with the sacerdotal garment, nor ever deprived of the sacerdotal function. But the &#8220;Jesus&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1463"></A><A HREF="#fn_1463"><FONT SIZE="1">1464</FONT></A>
 there alluded to is <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ix.xiv-p22.1"></A>Christ</span>, the Priest of God the most high Father; who at His <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ix.xiv-p22.2"></A>first advent</span> came in humility, in human form, and passible, even up to the period of His passion; being Himself likewise made, through all (stages of suffering) a victim for us all; who after His resurrection was &#8220;clad with a garment down to the foot,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1464"></A><A HREF="#fn_1464"><FONT SIZE="1">1465</FONT></A>
 and named the Priest of God the Father unto eternity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1465"></A><A HREF="#fn_1465"><FONT SIZE="1">1466</FONT></A>
 So, again, I will make an interpretation of the two goats which were habitually offered on the fast-day.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1466"></A><A HREF="#fn_1466"><FONT SIZE="1">1467</FONT></A>
 Do not they, too, point to each successive stage in the character of the Christ who is already come? A pair, on the one hand, and consimilar (they were), because of the identity of the Lord&#146;s general appearance, inasmuch as He is not to come in some other form, seeing that He has to be recognised by those by whom He was once hurt. But the one of them, begirt with scarlet, amid cursing and universal spitting, and tearing, and piercing, was cast away by the People outside the city into perdition, marked with manifest tokens of Christ&#146;s passion; who, after being begirt with scarlet garment, and subjected to universal spitting, and afflicted with all contumelies, was crucified outside the city.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1467"></A><A HREF="#fn_1467"><FONT SIZE="1">1468</FONT></A>
 The other, however, offered for sins, and given as food <i>to the priests merely</i> of the temple,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1468"></A><A HREF="#fn_1468"><FONT SIZE="1">1469</FONT></A>
 gave signal evidences of the second appearance; in so far as, after the expiation of all sins, the priests of the spiritual temple, that is, of the church, were to enjoy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1469"></A><A HREF="#fn_1469"><FONT SIZE="1">1470</FONT></A>
 a spiritual public distribution (as it were) of the Lord&#146;s grace, while all others are fasting from salvation.</p> 
<p class="c20"><a name="iv.ix.xiv-p29"></A>Therefore, since the vaticinations of the <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ix.xiv-p29.2"></A>first advent</span> obscured it with manifold figures, and debased it with every dishonour, while the <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ix.xiv-p29.3"></A>second</span> (was foretold as) manifest and wholly worthy of God, it has resulted therefrom, that, by fixing their gaze on that one alone which they could easily understand and believe (that is, the <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ix.xiv-p29.4"></A>second</span>, which is in honour and glory), they have been (not undeservedly) deceived as to the more obscure&#8212;at all events, the more unworthy&#8212;that is, the <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ix.xiv-p29.5"></A>first</span>. And thus to the present moment they affirm that their Christ is not come, because He is not come in majesty; while they are ignorant of&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1470"></A><A HREF="#fn_1470"><FONT SIZE="1">1471</FONT></A>
 the fact that He was first to come in humility.</p> 
<p class="c20"><a name="iv.ix.xiv-p31"></A>Enough it is, meantime, to have thus far followed the stream downward of the order of Christ&#146;s course, whereby He is proved such as He was habitually announced: in order that, as a result of this harmony of the Divine Scriptures, we may understand; and that the events which used to be predicted as destined to take place after Christ may be believed to have been accomplished as the result of a divine arrangement. For unless He come <i>after</i> whom they had to be accomplished, by no means would the events, the future occurrence whereof was predictively assigned to His advent, have come to pass.&#160; Therefore, if you see universal nations thenceforth emerging from the profundity of human error to God the Creator and His Christ (which you dare not assert to have not been prophesied, because, albeit you were so to assert, there would forthwith&#8212;as we have already premised&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1471"></A><A HREF="#fn_1471"><FONT SIZE="1">1472</FONT></A>
&#8212;occur to you the promise of the Father saying, &#8220;My Son art Thou; I this day have begotten Thee; ask of Me, and I will give Thee Gentiles <i>as</i> Thine heritage, and <i>as</i> Thy possession the boundaries of the earth.&#8221;&#160; Nor will you be able to vindicate, as the subject of that prediction, rather the son of David, Solomon, than Christ, God&#146;s Son; nor &#8220;the boundaries of the earth,&#8221; as promised rather to David&#146;s son, who reigned within the single land of Judea, than to Christ the Son of God, who has already illumined the whole world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1472"></A><A HREF="#fn_1472"><FONT SIZE="1">1473</FONT></A>
 with the rays of His gospel. In short, again, a throne &#8220;unto the age&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1473"></A><A HREF="#fn_1473"><FONT SIZE="1">1474</FONT></A>
 is more suitable to Christ, God&#146;s Son, than to Solomon,&#8212;a temporal king, to wit, who reigned over Israel alone. For at the present day nations are invoking Christ which used not to know Him; and peoples at the present day are fleeing in a body to the Christ of whom in days bygone they were ignorant&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1474"></A><A HREF="#fn_1474"><FONT SIZE="1">1475</FONT></A>
), you cannot contend that is future which you see taking place.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1475"></A><A HREF="#fn_1475"><FONT SIZE="1">1476</FONT></A>
 Either deny that these events were prophesied, while they are seen before your eyes; or else have been fulfilled, while you hear them read: or, on the other hand, if you fail to deny each position, they will have their fulfilment in Him with respect to whom they were prophesied.</p>
