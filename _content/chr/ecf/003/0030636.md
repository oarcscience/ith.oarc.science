<span id="v.viii.liv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIV.—Death Swallowed Up of Life.
Meaning of This Phrase in Relation to the Resurrection of the
Body.</span>

<span id="v.viii.liv-p2"></span>Then, again, questions very often are
suggested by occasional and isolated terms, just as much as they are by
connected sentences. Thus, because of the apostle’s expression, “that
mortality may be swallowed up of life” <span
id="fr_7699"></span>[7700](#fn_7699) —in reference to the flesh—they
wrest <span id="page_588">p. 588</span> <span
id="v.viii.liv-Page_588"></span>the word *swallowed up* into the sense
of the actual destruction of the flesh; as if we might not speak of
ourselves as swallowing bile, or swallowing grief, meaning that we
conceal and hide it, and keep it within ourselves. The truth is, when it
is written, “This mortal must put on immortality,” <span
id="fr_7700"></span>[7701](#fn_7700) it is explained in what sense it is
that “mortality is swallowed up of life”—even whilst, clothed with
immortality, it is hidden and concealed, and contained within it, not as
consumed, and destroyed, and lost. But death, you will say in reply to
me, at this rate, must be safe, even when it has been swallowed up.
Well, then, I ask you to distinguish words which are similar in form
according to their proper meanings. Death is one thing, and mortality is
another. It is one thing for death to be swallowed up, and another thing
for mortality to be swallowed up. Death is incapable of immortality, but
not so mortality. Besides, as it is written that “this mortal must put
on immortality,” <span id="fr_7701"></span>[7702](#fn_7701) how is this
possible when it is swallowed up of life? But how is it swallowed up of
life, (in the sense of destroyed by it) when it is actually received,
and restored, and included in it? For the rest, it is only just and
right that death should be swallowed up in utter destruction, since it
does itself devour with this same intent.  Death, says the apostle, has
devoured by exercising its strength, and therefore has been itself
devoured in the struggle “*swallowed up in victory*.” <span
id="fr_7702"></span>[7703](#fn_7702) “O death, where is thy sting? O
death, where is thy victory?” <span id="fr_7703"></span>[7704](#fn_7703)
Therefore life, too, as the great antagonist of death, will in the
struggle swallow up for salvation what death, in its struggle, had
swallowed up for destruction.
