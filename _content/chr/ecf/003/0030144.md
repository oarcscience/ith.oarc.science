<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV. <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501) —The Truth Hated in the Christians; So
in Measure Was It, of Old, in Socrates. The Virtues of the
Christians.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.iv-p3"></span>But the sect, you say, is punished in
the name of its founder. Now in the first place it is, no doubt, a fair
and usual custom that a sect should be marked out by the name of its
founder, since philosophers are called Pythagoreans and Platonists after
their masters; in the same way physicians are called after Erasistratus,
and grammarians after Aristarchus. If, therefore, a sect has a bad
character because its founder was bad, it is punished <span
id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502) as the traditional bearer <span
id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503) of a bad name. But this would be
indulging in a rash assumption. <span id="page_112">p. 112</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.iv-Page_112"></span>The first step was to find out what
the founder was, that his sect might be understood, instead of
hindering <span id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504) inquiry into the
founder’s character from the sect. But in our case, <span
id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505) by being necessarily ignorant of the
sect, through your ignorance of its founder, or else by not taking a
fair survey of the founder, because you make no inquiry into his sect,
you fasten merely on the name, just as if you vilified in it both sect
and founder, whom you know nothing of whatever. And yet you openly allow
your philosophers the right of attaching themselves to any school, and
bearing its founder’s name as their own; and nobody stirs up any hatred
against them, although both in public and in private they bark out <span
id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506) their bitterest eloquence against your
customs, rites, ceremonies, and manner of life, with so much contempt
for the laws, and so little respect for persons, that they even flaunt
their licentious words <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507) against
the emperors themselves with impunity.  And yet it is the truth, which
is so troublesome to the world, that these philosophers affect, but
which Christians possess: they therefore who have it in possession
afford the greater displeasure, because he who affects a thing plays
with it; he who possesses it maintains it. For example, <span
id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508) Socrates was condemned on that side
(of his wisdom) in which he came nearest in his search to the truth, by
destroying your gods. Although the name of Christian was not at that
time in the world, yet truth was always suffering condemnation. Now you
will not deny that he was a wise man, to whom your own Pythian (god) had
borne witness. Socrates, he said, was the wisest of men. Truth overbore
Apollo, and made him pronounce even against himself since he
acknowledged that he was no god, when he affirmed that that was the
wisest man who was denying the gods. However, <span
id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509) on your principle he was the less wise
because he denied the gods, although, in truth, he was all the wiser by
reason of this denial. It is just in the same way that you are in the
habit of saying of us: “Lucius Titius is a good man, only he is a
Christian;” while another says; “I wonder that so worthy <span
id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510) a man as Caius Seius has become a
Christian.” <span id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511) According to <span
id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512) the blindness of their folly men
praise what they know, (and) blame what they are ignorant of; and that
which they know, they vitiate by that which they do not know. It occurs
to none (to consider) whether a man is not good and wise because he is a
Christian, or therefore a Christian because he is wise and good,
although it is more usual in human conduct to determine obscurities by
what is manifest, than to prejudice what is manifest by what is
obscure.  Some persons wonder that those whom they had known to be
unsteady, worthless, *or* wicked before they bore this <span
id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513) name, have been suddenly converted to
virtuous courses; and yet they better know how to wonder (at the change)
than to attain to it; others are so obstinate in their strife as to do
battle with their own best interests, which they have it in their power
to secure by intercourse <span id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514) with
that hated name. I know more than one <span
id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515) husband, formerly anxious about their
wives’ conduct, and unable to bear even mice to creep into their
bed-room without a groan of suspicion, who have, upon discovering the
cause of their new assiduity, and their unwonted attention to the duties
of home, <span id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516) offered the entire loan
of their wives to others, <span id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517)
disclaimed all jealousy, (and) preferred to be the husbands of
she-wolves than of Christian women: they could commit themselves to a
perverse abuse of nature, but they could not permit their wives to be
reformed for the better! A father disinherited his son, with whom he had
ceased to find fault. A master sent his slave to bridewell, <span
id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518) whom he had even found to be
indispensable to him. As soon as they discovered them to be Christians,
they wished they were criminals again; for our discipline carries its
own evidence in itself, nor are we betrayed by anything else than our
own goodness, just as bad men also become conspicuous <span
id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519) by their own evil. Else how is it that
we alone are, contrary to the lessons of nature, branded as very evil
because of our good? For what mark do we exhibit except the prime
wisdom, <span id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520) which teaches us not to
worship the frivolous works of the human hand; the temperance, by which
we abstain from other men’s goods; the chastity, which we pollute not
even with a look; the compassion, which prompts us to help the needy;
the truth itself, which makes us give offence; and liberty, for which we
have even learned to die? Whoever wishes to understand who the
Christians are, must needs employ these marks for their discovery.
