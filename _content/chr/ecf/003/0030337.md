<span id="v.iv.ii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—God’s Attribute of
Goodness Considered as Rational. Marcion’s God Defective Here Also; His
Goodness Irrational and Misapplied.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xxiii-p2"></span>Here is another rule for him. All the
properties of God ought to be as rational as they are natural. I require
reason in His goodness, because nothing else can properly be accounted
good than that which is rationally good; much less can goodness itself
be detected in any irrationality. More easily will an evil thing which
has something rational belonging to it be accounted good, than that a
good thing bereft of all reasonable quality should escape being regarded
as evil. Now I deny that the goodness of Marcion’s god is rational, on
this account first, because it proceeded to the salvation of a human
creature which was alien to him. I am aware of the plea which they will
adduce, that that is rather <span id="fr_2599"></span>[2600](#fn_2599) a
primary and perfect goodness which is shed voluntarily and freely upon
strangers without any obligation of friendship, <span
id="fr_2600"></span>[2601](#fn_2600) on the principle that we are bidden
to love even our enemies, such as are also on that very account
strangers to us.  Now, inasmuch as from the first he had no regard for
man, a stranger to him from the first, he settled beforehand, by this
neglect of his, that he had nothing to do with an alien creature. 
Besides, the rule of loving a stranger or enemy is preceded by the
precept of your loving your neighbour as yourself; and this precept,
although coming from the Creator’s law, even you ought to receive,
because, so far from being abrogated by Christ, it has rather been
confirmed by Him. For you are bidden to love your enemy and the
stranger, in order that you may love your neighbour the better. The
requirement of the undue is an augmentation of the due benevolence. But
the due precedes the undue, as the principal quality, and more worthy of
the other, for its attendant and companion. <span
id="fr_2601"></span>[2602](#fn_2601) Since, therefore, the first step in
the reasonableness of the divine goodness is that it displays itself on
its proper object <span id="fr_2602"></span>[2603](#fn_2602) in
righteousness, and only at its second stage on an alien object by a
redundant righteousness over and above that of scribes and Pharisees,
how comes it to pass that the second is attributed to him who fails in
the first, not having man for his proper object, and who makes his
goodness on this very account defective? Moreover, how could a defective
benevolence, which had no proper object whereon to expend itself,
overflow <span id="fr_2603"></span>[2604](#fn_2603) on an alien one?
Clear up the first step, and then vindicate the next.  Nothing can be
claimed as rational without order, much less can reason itself <span
id="fr_2604"></span>[2605](#fn_2604) dispense with order in any one.
Suppose now *the divine* goodness begin at the second stage of its
rational operation, that is to say, on the stranger, this second stage
will not be consistent in rationality if it be impaired in any way
else. <span id="fr_2605"></span>[2606](#fn_2605) For only then will even
the second stage of goodness, that which is displayed towards the
stranger, be accounted rational, when it operates without wrong to him
who has the first claim. <span id="fr_2606"></span>[2607](#fn_2606) It
is righteousness <span id="fr_2607"></span>[2608](#fn_2607) which before
everything else makes all goodness rational. It will thus be rational in
its principal stage, when manifested on its proper object, if it be
righteous. And thus, in like manner, it will be able to appear rational,
when displayed towards the stranger, if it be not unrighteous. But what
sort of goodness is that which is manifested in wrong, and *that* <span
id="page_289">p. 289</span> <span id="v.iv.ii.xxiii-Page_289"></span>in
behalf of an alien creature?  For peradventure a benevolence, even when
operating injuriously, might be deemed to some extent rational, if
exerted for one of our own house and home. <span
id="fr_2608"></span>[2609](#fn_2608) By what rule, however, can an
unjust benevolence, displayed on behalf of a stranger, to whom not even
an honest one is legitimately due, be defended as a rational one? For
what is more unrighteous, more unjust, more dishonest, than so to
benefit an alien slave as to take him away from his master, claim him as
the property of another, and suborn him against his master’s life; and
all this, to make the matter more iniquitous still whilst he is yet
living in his master’s house and on his master’s garner, and still
trembling beneath his stripes? Such a deliverer, <span
id="fr_2609"></span>[2610](#fn_2609) I had almost said <span
id="fr_2610"></span>[2611](#fn_2610) kidnapper, <span
id="fr_2611"></span>[2612](#fn_2611) would even meet with condemnation
in the world.  Now, no other than this is the character of Marcion’s
god, swooping upon an alien world, snatching away man from his
God, <span id="fr_2612"></span>[2613](#fn_2612) the son from his father,
the pupil from his tutor, the servant from his master—to make him
impious to his God, undutiful to his father, ungrateful to his tutor,
worthless to his master. If, now, the rational benevolence makes man
such, what sort of being prithee <span
id="fr_2613"></span>[2614](#fn_2613) would the irrational make of him?
None I should think more shameless than him who is baptized to his <span
id="fr_2614"></span>[2615](#fn_2614) god in water which belongs to
another, who stretches out his hands <span
id="fr_2615"></span>[2616](#fn_2615) to his god towards a heaven which
is another’s, who kneels to his god on ground which is another’s, offers
his thanksgivings to his god over bread which belongs to another, <span
id="fr_2616"></span>[2617](#fn_2616) and distributes <span
id="fr_2617"></span>[2618](#fn_2617) by way of alms and charity, for the
sake of his god, gifts which belong to another God. Who, then, is that
so good a god of theirs, that man through him becomes evil; so
propitious, too, as to incense against man that other God who is,
indeed, his own proper Lord?

<span id="v.iv.ii.xxiii-p5"></span> This is the sense of the passage as
read by Oehler: “Antecedit autem debita indebitam, ut principalis, ut
dignior ministra et comite sua, id est indebita.” Fr. Junius, however,
added the word “prior” which begins the next sentence to these words,
making the last clause run thus: “ut dignior ministra, et comite sua, id
est indebita, prior”—“as being more worthy of an attendant, and as being
prior to its companion, that is, the undue benevolence.” It is difficult
to find any good use of the “prior” in the next sentence, “Prior igitur
cum prima bonitatis ratio sit,” etc., as Oehler and others point it.

id="v.iv.ii.xxiii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xxiii-p19"></span> Therefore Christians used to lift
their hands and arms towards heaven in prayer. Compare *The Apology*,
chap. 30, (where the *manibus expansis* betokens the open hand, not
merely as the heathen *tendens* ad sidera palmas). See also *De Orat*.
c. 13, and other passages from different writers referred to in the
“Tertullian” of the Oxford *Library of the Fathers*, p. 70.  \[See the
figures in the Catacombs as represented by Parker, Marriott and
others.\]

<span id="v.iv.ii.xxiii-p20"></span> To the same effect Irenæus had
said: “How will it be consistent in them to hold that the bread on which
thanks are given is the body of their Lord, and that the cup is His
blood, if they do not acknowledge that He is the Son of the Creator of
the world, that is, the Word of God?” (Rigalt.)  \[The consecrated bread
is still *bread*, in Patristic theology.\]

<span id="fn_2617"></span>[289:2618](0030337.htm#fr_2617) <span
id="v.iv.ii.xxiii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xxiii-p21"></span> Operatur, a not unfrequent use of
the word. Thus Prudentius (*Psychom*. 572) opposes *operatio* to
*avaritia*.
