<span id="v.iii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—After We Have Believed, Search
Should Cease; Otherwise It Must End in a Denial of What We Have
Believed. No Other Object Proposed for Our Faith.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xi-p2"></span>There is impunity in erring, if there is
no delinquency; although indeed to err it is itself an act of
delinquency. <span id="fr_1980"></span>[1981](#fn_1980) With impunity, I
repeat, does a man ramble, <span id="fr_1981"></span>[1982](#fn_1981)
when he (purposely) deserts nothing. But yet, if I have believed what I
was bound to believe, and then afterwards think that there is something
new to be sought after, I of course expect that there is something else
to be found, although I should by no means entertain such <span
id="page_249">p. 249</span> <span
id="v.iii.xi-Page_249"></span>expectation, unless it were because I
either had not believed, although I apparently had become a believer, or
else have ceased to believe. If I thus desert my faith, I am found to be
a denier thereof. Once for all I would say, No man seeks, except him who
either never possessed, or else has lost (what he sought). The old woman
(in the Gospel) <span id="fr_1982"></span>[1983](#fn_1982) had lost one
of her ten pieces of silver, and therefore she sought it; <span
id="fr_1983"></span>[1984](#fn_1983) when, however, she found it, she
ceased to look for it. The neighbour was without bread, and therefore he
knocked; but as soon as the door was opened to him, and he received the
bread, he discontinued knocking. <span
id="fr_1984"></span>[1985](#fn_1984) The widow kept asking to be heard
by the judge, because she was not admitted; but when her suit was heard,
thenceforth she was silent. <span id="fr_1985"></span>[1986](#fn_1985)
So that there is a limit both to seeking, and to knocking, and to
asking. “For to every one that asketh,” says He, “it shall be given, and
to him that knocketh it shall be opened, and by him that seeketh it
shall be found.” <span id="fr_1986"></span>[1987](#fn_1986) Away with
the man <span id="fr_1987"></span>[1988](#fn_1987) who is ever seeking
because he never finds; for he seeks there where nothing can be found.
Away with him who is always knocking because it will never be opened to
him; for he knocks where there is none (to open). Away with him who is
always asking because he will never be heard; for he asks of one who
does not hear.
