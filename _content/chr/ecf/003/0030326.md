<span id="v.iv.ii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.ii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Impossibility of Acknowledging
God Without This External Evidence <span
id="fr_2460"></span>[2461](#fn_2460) Of His Existence. Marcion’s
Rejection of Such Evidence for His God Savours of Impudence and
Malignity.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xii-p3"></span>But even if we were able to allow that
he exists, we should yet be bound to argue that he is without a
cause. <span id="fr_2461"></span>[2462](#fn_2461) For he who had nothing
(to show for himself as proof of his existence), would be without a
cause, since (such) proof <span id="fr_2462"></span>[2463](#fn_2462) is
the whole cause that there exists <span id="page_280">p. 280</span>
<span id="v.iv.ii.xii-Page_280"></span>some person to whom the proof
belongs. Now, in *as* far as nothing ought to be without a cause, that
is, without a proof (because if it be without a cause, it is all one as
if it be not, not having the very proof which is the cause of a thing),
in *so* far shall I more worthily believe that God does not exist, than
that He exists without a cause. For he is without a cause who has not a
cause by reason of not having a proof. God, however, ought not to be
without a cause, that is to say, without a proof. Thus, as often as I
show that He exists without a cause, although (I allow <span
id="fr_2463"></span>[2464](#fn_2463) that) He exists, I do really
determine this, that He does not exist; because, if He had existed, He
could not have existed altogether without a cause. <span
id="fr_2464"></span>[2465](#fn_2464) So, too, even in regard to faith
itself, I say that he <span id="fr_2465"></span>[2466](#fn_2465) seeks
to obtain it <span id="fr_2466"></span>[2467](#fn_2466) without cause
from man, who is otherwise accustomed to believe in God from the idea he
gets of Him from the testimony of His works: <span
id="fr_2467"></span>[2468](#fn_2467) (without cause, I repeat,) because
he has provided no such proof as that whereby man has acquired the
knowledge of God. For although most persons believe in Him, they do not
believe at once by unaided reason, <span
id="fr_2468"></span>[2469](#fn_2468) without having some token of Deity
in works worthy of God. And so upon this ground of inactivity and lack
of works he <span id="fr_2469"></span>[2470](#fn_2469) is guilty both of
impudence and malignity:  of impudence, in aspiring after a belief which
is not due to him, and for which he has provided no foundation; <span
id="fr_2470"></span>[2471](#fn_2470) of malignity, in having brought
many persons under the charge of unbelief by furnishing to them no
groundwork for their faith.

<span id="v.iv.ii.xii-p2"></span> The word *cause* throughout this
chapter is used in the popular, inaccurate sense, which almost confounds
it with *effect*, the “causa cognoscendi,” as distinguished from the
“causa essendi,” the strict *cause*.

<span id="fn_2461"></span>[279:2462](0030326.htm#fr_2461) <span
id="v.iv.ii.xii-p3.2"></span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xii-p4"></span> The word *cause* throughout this
chapter is used in the popular, inaccurate sense, which almost confounds
it with *effect*, the “causa cognoscendi,” as distinguished from the
“causa essendi,” the strict *cause*.

id="v.iv.ii.xii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xii-p5"></span> The word “*res*” is throughout this
argument used strictly by Tertullian; it refers to “*the thing*” made by
God—that product of His creative energy which affords to us evidence of
His existence. We have translated it “*proof*” for want of a better
word.

id="v.iv.ii.xii-p5.2"></span>

<span id="v.iv.ii.xii-p6"></span> The “tanquam sit,” in its subjunctive
form, seems to refer to the concession indicated at the outset of the
chapter.

20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020)<span
id="v.iv.ii.xii-p13.1"></span>, a passage which is quite subversive of
Marcion’s theory.
