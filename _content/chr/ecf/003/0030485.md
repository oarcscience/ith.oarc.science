<span id="v.v.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—A Series of Dilemmas.  They Show
that Hermogenes Cannot Escape from the Orthodox Conclusion.</span>

<span id="v.v.xvi-p2"></span>On the very threshold, <span
id="fr_6277"></span>[6278](#fn_6277) then, of this doctrine, <span
id="fr_6278"></span>[6279](#fn_6278) which I shall probably have to
treat of elsewhere, I distinctly lay it down as my position, that both
good and evil must be ascribed either to God, who made them out of
Matter; or to Matter itself, out of which He made them; or both one and
the other to both of them together, <span
id="fr_6279"></span>[6280](#fn_6279) because they are bound
together—both He who created, and that out of which He created; or
(lastly) one to One and the other to the Other, <span
id="fr_6280"></span>[6281](#fn_6280) because after Matter and God there
is not a third. Now if both should prove to belong *to God*, God
evidently will be the author of evil; but God, as being good, cannot be
the author of evil. Again, if both are ascribed *to Matter*, Matter will
evidently be the very mother of good, <span
id="fr_6281"></span>[6282](#fn_6281) but inasmuch as Matter is wholly
evil, it cannot be the mother of good. But if both one and the other
should be thought to belong to Both together, then in this case also
Matter will be comparable with God; and both will be equal, being on
equal terms allied to evil as well as to good. Matter, however, ought
not to be compared with God, in order that it may not make two gods. If,
(lastly,) one be ascribed to One, and the other to the Other—that is to
say, let the good be God’s, and the evil belong to Matter—then, on the
one hand, evil must not be ascribed to God, nor, on the other hand, good
to Matter.  And God, moreover, by making both good things and evil
things out of Matter, creates *them* along with it. This being the case,
I cannot tell how Hermogenes <span id="fr_6282"></span>[6283](#fn_6282)
is to escape from my conclusion; for he supposes that God cannot be the
author of evil, in what way soever He created evil out of Matter,
whether it was of His own will, or of necessity, or from the reason (of
the case). If, however, He is the author of evil, who was the actual
Creator, Matter being simply associated *with Him* by reason of its
furnishing Him with substance, <span
id="fr_6283"></span>[6284](#fn_6283) you now do away with the
cause <span id="fr_6284"></span>[6285](#fn_6284) of *your* introducing
Matter. For it is not the less *true*, that it is by means of Matter
that God shows Himself the author of evil, although Matter has been
assumed *by you* expressly to prevent God’s seeming to be the author of
evil. Matter being therefore excluded, since the cause of it is
excluded, it remains that God without doubt, must have made all things
out of nothing. Whether evil things were amongst them we shall see, when
it shall be made clear what are evil things, and whether those things
are evil which you at present deem to be so. For it is more worthy of
God that He produced even these of His own will, by producing them out
of nothing, than from the predetermination of another, <span
id="fr_6285"></span>[6286](#fn_6285) (which must have been the case) if
He had produced them out of Matter. It is liberty, not necessity, which
suits the character of God. I would much rather that He should have even
willed to create evil of Himself, than that He should have lacked
ability to hinder its creation.

<span id="v.v.xvi-p8"></span> The usual reading is “Hermogenes.”
Rigaltius, however, reads “Hermogenis,” of which Oehler approves; so as
to make Tertullian say, “I cannot tell how I can avoid the opinion of
Hermogenes, who,” etc. etc.

Matter was eternal, to exclude God from the authorship of evil.  This
*causa* of Matter he was now illogically evading. Excusare = ex, causa,
“to cancel the cause.”
