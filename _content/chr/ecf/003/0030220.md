<span id="iv.xi.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—The Soul’s Parts. Elements of
the Rational Soul.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xvi-p2"></span>That position of Plato’s is also quite in
keeping with the faith, in which he divides the soul into two parts—the
rational and the irrational.  To this definition we take no exception,
except that we would not ascribe this twofold distinction to the nature
(of the soul). It is the rational element which we must believe to be
its natural condition, impressed upon it from its very first creation by
its Author, who is Himself essentially rational. For how should that be
other than rational, which God produced on His own prompting; nay more,
which He expressly sent forth by His own *afflatus* or breath? The
irrational element, however, we must understand to have accrued later,
as having proceeded from the instigation of the serpent—the very
achievement of (the first) transgression—which thenceforward became
inherent in the soul, and grew with its growth, assuming the manner by
this time of a natural development, happening as it did immediately at
the beginning of nature.  But, inasmuch as the same Plato speaks of the
rational element only as existing in the soul of God Himself, if we were
to ascribe the irrational element likewise to the nature which our soul
has received from God, then the irrational element will be equally
derived from God, as being a natural production, because God is the
author of nature. Now from the devil proceeds the incentive to sin. All
sin, however, is irrational: therefore the irrational proceeds from the
devil, from whom sin proceeds; and it is ex<span id="page_195">p.
195</span> <span id="iv.xi.xvi-Page_195"></span>traneous to God, to whom
also the irrational is an alien principle.  The diversity, then, between
these two elements arises from the difference of their authors. When,
therefore, Plato reserves the rational element (of the soul) to God
alone, and subdivides it into two departments: the *irascible*, which
they call <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xi.xvi-p2.1"></span>θυμικόν</span>, and the *concupiscible*,
which they designate by the term <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xi.xvi-p2.2"></span>ἐπιθυμητικόν</span> (in such a way as to make
the first common to us and lions, and the second shared between
ourselves and flies, whilst the rational element is confined to us and
God)—I see that this point will have to be treated by us, owing to the
facts which we find operating also in Christ. For you may behold this
triad of qualities in the Lord. There was the *rational* element, by
which He taught, by which He discoursed, by which He prepared the way of
salvation; there was moreover *indignation* in Him, by which He
inveighed against the scribes and the Pharisees; and there was the
principle of *desire*, by which He so earnestly desired to eat the
passover with His disciples. <span id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598)
In our own cases, accordingly, the irascible and the concupiscible
elements of our soul must not invariably be put to the account of the
irrational (nature), since we are sure that in our Lord these elements
operated in entire accordance with reason. God will be angry, with
perfect reason, with all who deserve His wrath; and with reason, too,
will God desire whatever objects and claims are worthy of Himself.  For
He will show indignation against the evil man, and for the good man will
He desire salvation. To ourselves even does the apostle allow the
concupiscible quality. “If any man,” says he, “desireth the office of a
bishop, he desireth a good work.” <span
id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599) Now, by saying “a good work,” he
shows us that the desire is a reasonable one. He permits us likewise to
feel indignation.  How should he not, when he himself experiences the
same? “I would,” says he, “that they were even cut off which trouble
you.” <span id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600) In perfect agreement
with reason was that indignation which resulted from his desire to
maintain discipline and order. When, however, he says, “We were formerly
the children of wrath,” <span id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601) he
censures an irrational irascibility, such as proceeds not from that
nature which is the production of God, but from that which the devil
brought in, who is himself styled the lord or “master” of his own class,
“Ye cannot serve two *masters*,” <span
id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602) and has the actual designation of
“father:”  “Ye are of your *father* the devil.” <span
id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603) So that you need not be afraid to
ascribe to him the mastery and dominion over that second, later, and
deteriorated nature (of which we have been speaking), when you read of
him as “the sewer of tares,” and the nocturnal spoiler of the crop of
corn. <span id="fr_1604"></span>[1605](#fn_1604)
