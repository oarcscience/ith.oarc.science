<span id="v.iii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—The Apostles Did Not Keep Back
Any of the Deposit of Doctrine Which Christ Had Entrusted to Them. St.
Paul Openly Committed His Whole Doctrine to Timothy.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xxv-p2"></span>But here is, as we have said, <span
id="fr_2114"></span>[2115](#fn_2114) the same madness, in their allowing
indeed that the apostles were ignorant of nothing, and preached not any
(doctrines) which contradicted one another, but at the same time
insisting that they did not reveal all to all men, for that they
proclaimed some openly and to <span id="page_255">p. 255</span> <span
id="v.iii.xxv-Page_255"></span>all the world, whilst they disclosed
others (only) in secret and to a few, because Paul addressed even this
expression to Timothy: “O Timothy, guard that which is entrusted to
thee;” <span id="fr_2115"></span>[2116](#fn_2115) and again: “That good
thing which was committed unto thee keep.” <span
id="fr_2116"></span>[2117](#fn_2116) What is this deposit? Is it so
secret as to be supposed to characterize <span
id="fr_2117"></span>[2118](#fn_2117) a new doctrine? or is it a part of
that charge of which he says, “This charge I commit unto thee, son
Timothy?” <span id="fr_2118"></span>[2119](#fn_2118) and also of that
precept of which he says, “I charge thee in the sight of God, who
quickeneth all things, and before Jesus Christ who witnessed a good
confession under Pontius Pilate, that thou keep this commandment?” <span
id="fr_2119"></span>[2120](#fn_2119) Now, what is (this) commandment and
what is (this) charge? From the preceding and the succeeding contexts,
it will be manifest that there is no mysterious <span
id="fr_2120"></span>[2121](#fn_2120) hint darkly suggested in this
expression about (some) far-fetched <span
id="fr_2121"></span>[2122](#fn_2121) doctrine, but that a warning is
rather given against receiving any other (doctrine) than that which
*Timothy* had heard from himself, *as I take it* publicly: “Before many
witnesses” is his phrase. <span id="fr_2122"></span>[2123](#fn_2122)
Now, if they refuse to allow that the church is meant by these “many
witnesses,” it matters nothing, since nothing could have been secret
which was produced “before many witnesses.” Nor, again, must the
circumstance of his having wished him to “commit these things to
faithful men, who should be able to teach others also,” <span
id="fr_2123"></span>[2124](#fn_2123) be construed into a proof of there
being some occult gospel. For, when he says “these things,” he refers to
the things of which he is writing at the moment. In reference, however,
to occult subjects, he would have called them, as being absent, *those
things*, not *these things*, to one who had a joint knowledge of them
with himself. <span id="fr_2124"></span>[2125](#fn_2124)

<span id="v.iii.xxv-p13"></span> Apud conscientiam. \[Clement of
Alexandria is to be interpreted by *Tertullian*, with whom he does not
essentially differ. For Clement’s Esoteric Doctrine (See Vol. II. pp.
302, 313, etc.) is defined as *perfecting* the type of the Christian by
the *strong meat* of Truth, of which *the entire deposit* is presupposed
as common to all Christians. We must not blame Clement for the abuse of
his teaching by perverters of Truth itself.\]
