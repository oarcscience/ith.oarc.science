<span id="v.v.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Sundry Inevitable But Intolerable
Conclusions from the Principles of Hermogenes.</span>

<span id="v.v.ix-p2"></span>He cannot say that it was as its Lord that
God employed Matter for His creative works, for He could not have been
the Lord of a substance which was co-equal with Himself. Well, but
perhaps it was a title derived from the will of another, <span
id="fr_6207"></span>[6208](#fn_6207) which he enjoyed—a precarious
holding, and not a lordship, <span id="fr_6208"></span>[6209](#fn_6208)
and *that* to such a degree, that <span
id="fr_6209"></span>[6210](#fn_6209) although Matter was evil, He yet
endured to make use of an evil substance, owing, of course, to the
restraint of His own limited power, <span
id="fr_6210"></span>[6211](#fn_6210) which made Him impotent to create
out of nothing, not in consequence of His power; for if, as God, He had
at all possessed power over Matter which He knew to be evil, He would
first have converted it into good—as its Lord and the good God—that so
He might have a good thing to make use of, instead of a bad one. But
being undoubtedly good, only not the Lord withal, He, by using such
power <span id="fr_6211"></span>[6212](#fn_6211) as He possessed, showed
the necessity He was under of yielding to the condition of Matter, which
He would have amended if He had been its Lord. Now this is the answer
which must be given to Hermogenes when he maintains that it was by
virtue of His Lordship that God used Matter—even of His non-possession
of any right to it, on the ground, of course, of His not having Himself
made it.  Evil then, on your terms, <span
id="fr_6212"></span>[6213](#fn_6212) must proceed from *God* Himself,
since He is—I will not say the Author of evil, because He did not form
it, but—the permitter thereof, as having dominion over it. <span
id="fr_6213"></span>[6214](#fn_6213) If indeed Matter shall prove not
even to belong to God at all, as being evil, it follows, <span
id="fr_6214"></span>[6215](#fn_6214) that when He made use of what
belonged to another, He used it either on a precarious title <span
id="fr_6215"></span>[6216](#fn_6215) because He was in need of it, or
else by violent possession because He was stronger than it. For by three
methods is the property of others obtained,—by right, by permission, by
violence; in other words, by lordship, by a title derived from the will
of another, <span id="fr_6216"></span>[6217](#fn_6216) by force. Now, as
lordship is out of the question, Hermogenes must choose which (of the
other methods) is suitable to God. Did He, then, make all things out of
Matter, by permission, or by force?  But, in truth, would not God have
more wisely determined that nothing at all should be created, than that
it should be created by the mere sufferance of another, or by violence,
and that, too, with <span id="fr_6217"></span>[6218](#fn_6217) a
substance which was evil?
