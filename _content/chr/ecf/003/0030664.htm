<p class="c30"><a name="v.ix.xvii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="v.ix.xvii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XVII.&#8212;Sundry August Titles, Descriptive of Deity, Applied to the Son, Not, as Praxeas Would Have It, Only to the Father.</span></p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="v.ix.xvii-p2"></A>They more readily supposed that the Father acted in the Son&#146;s name, than that the Son acted in the Father&#146;s; although the Lord says Himself, &#8220;I am come in my Father&#146;s name;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7978"></A><A HREF="#fn_7978"><FONT SIZE="1">7979</FONT></A>
 and even to the Father He declares, &#8220;I have manifested Thy name unto these <A NAME="page_613"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 613</FONT></A> <a name="v.ix.xvii-Page_613"></A>men;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7979"></A><A HREF="#fn_7979"><FONT SIZE="1">7980</FONT></A>
 whilst the Scripture likewise says, &#8220;Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7980"></A><A HREF="#fn_7980"><FONT SIZE="1">7981</FONT></A>
 that is to say, the Son in the Father&#146;s name.&#160; And as for the Father&#146;s names, God Almighty, the Most High, the Lord of hosts, the King of Israel, the &#8220;One that is,&#8221; we say (for so much do the Scriptures teach us) that they belonged suitably to the Son also, and that the Son came under these designations, and has always acted in them, and has thus manifested them in Himself to men. &#8220;All things,&#8221; says He, &#8220;which the Father hath are mine.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7981"></A><A HREF="#fn_7981"><FONT SIZE="1">7982</FONT></A>
 Then why not His names also? When, therefore, you read of Almighty God, and the Most High, and the God of hosts, and the King of Israel, the &#8220;One that is,&#8221; consider whether the Son also be not indicated by these designations, who in His own right is God Almighty, in that He is the Word of Almighty God, and has received power over all; is the Most High, in that He is &#8220;exalted at the right hand of God,&#8221; as Peter declares in the Acts;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7982"></A><A HREF="#fn_7982"><FONT SIZE="1">7983</FONT></A>
 is the Lord of hosts, because all things are by the Father made subject to Him; is the King of Israel because to Him has especially been committed the destiny of that nation; and is likewise &#8220;the One that is,&#8221; because there are many who are called Sons, but <i>are not</i>. As to the point maintained by them, that the name of Christ belongs also to the Father, they shall hear (what I have to say) in the proper place. Meanwhile, let this be my immediate answer to the argument which they adduce from the Revelation of John: &#8220;I am the Lord which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7983"></A><A HREF="#fn_7983"><FONT SIZE="1">7984</FONT></A>
 and from all other passages which in their opinion make the designation of Almighty God unsuitable to the Son. As if, indeed, <i>He which is to come</i> were not almighty; whereas even the Son of the Almighty is as much almighty as the Son of God is God.</p>
