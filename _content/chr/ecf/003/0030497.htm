<p class="c19"><a name="v.v.xxviii-p2"></A>But we shall show not only that this condition&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6391"></A><A HREF="#fn_6391"><FONT SIZE="1">6392</FONT></A>
 agreed with this earth of ours, but that <A NAME="page_493"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 493</FONT></A> <a name="v.v.xxviii-Page_493"></A>it did not agree with that other (insisted on by Hermogenes). For, inasmuch as pure Matter was thus subsistent with God,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6392"></A><A HREF="#fn_6392"><FONT SIZE="1">6393</FONT></A>
 without the interposition indeed of any element at all (because as yet there existed nothing but itself and God), it could not of course have been invisible. Because, although <i>Hermogenes</i> contends that darkness was inherent in the substance of Matter, a position which we shall have to meet in its proper place,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6393"></A><A HREF="#fn_6393"><FONT SIZE="1">6394</FONT></A>
 yet darkness is visible even to a human being (for the very fact that there is the darkness is an evident one), much more is it so to God. If indeed it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6394"></A><A HREF="#fn_6394"><FONT SIZE="1">6395</FONT></A>
 had been invisible, its quality would not have been by any means discoverable. How, then, did Hermogenes find out&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6395"></A><A HREF="#fn_6395"><FONT SIZE="1">6396</FONT></A>
 that that substance was &#8220;without form,&#8221; and confused and disordered, which, as being invisible, was not palpable to his senses? If this mystery was revealed to him by God, he ought to give us his proof. I want to know also, whether (the substance in question) could have been described as &#8220;void.&#8221; That certainly is &#8220;void&#8221; which is imperfect. Equally certain is it, that nothing can be imperfect but that which is made; it is imperfect when it is not fully made.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6396"></A><A HREF="#fn_6396"><FONT SIZE="1">6397</FONT></A>
 Certainly, you admit. Matter, therefore, which was not made at all, could not have been imperfect; and what was not imperfect was not &#8220;void.&#8221; Having no beginning, because it was not made, it was also unsusceptible of any void-condition.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6397"></A><A HREF="#fn_6397"><FONT SIZE="1">6398</FONT></A>
 For this void-condition is an accident of beginning. The earth, on the contrary, which was made, was deservedly called &#8220;void.&#8221;&#160; For as soon as it was made, it had the condition of being imperfect, previous to its completion.</p>
