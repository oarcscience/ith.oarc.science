<span id="v.iv.vi.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—The Epistle to the Philippians.
The Variances Amongst the Preachers of Christ No Argument that There Was
More Than One Only Christ. St. Paul’s Phrases—Form of a Servant,
Likeness, and Fashion of a Man—No Sanction of Docetism. No Antithesis
(Such as Marcion Alleged) in the God of Judaism and the God of the
Gospel Deducible from Certain Contrasts Mentioned in This Epistle. A
Parallel with a Passage in Genesis. The Resurrection of the Body, and
the Change Thereof.</span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.xx-p2"></span>When (the apostle) mentions the several
motives of those who were preaching the gospel, how that some, “waxing
confident by his bonds, were more fearless in speaking the word,” while
others “preached Christ even out of envy and strife, and again others
out of good-will,” many also “out of love,” and certain “out of
contention,” and some “in rivalry to himself,” <span
id="fr_6095"></span>[6096](#fn_6095) he had a favourable opportunity, no
doubt, <span id="fr_6096"></span>[6097](#fn_6096) of taxing what they
preached with a diversity of doctrine, as if it were no less than this
which caused so great a variance in their tempers. But while he exposes
these tempers as the sole cause of the diversity, he avoids inculpating
the regular mysteries of the faith, <span
id="fr_6097"></span>[6098](#fn_6097) and affirms that there is,
notwithstanding, but one Christ and His one God, whatever motives men
had in preaching Him.  Therefore, says he, it matters not to me “whether
it be in pretence or in truth that Christ is preached,” <span
id="fr_6098"></span>[6099](#fn_6098) because one Christ alone was
announced, whether in their “pretentious” or their “truthful” faith. For
it was to the faithfulness of their preaching that he applied the word
*truth*, not to the rightness of the rule itself, because there was
indeed but one rule; whereas the conduct of the preachers varied: in
some of them it was true, *i.e.* single-minded, while in others it was
sophisticated with over-much learning.  This being the case, it is
manifest that that Christ was the subject of their preaching who was
always the theme of the prophets. Now, if it were a completely different
Christ that was being introduced by the apostle, the novelty of the
thing would have produced a diversity (in belief.). For there would not
have been wanting, in spite of the novel teaching, <span
id="fr_6099"></span>[6100](#fn_6099) men to interpret the preached
gospel of the Creator’s Christ, since the majority of persons everywhere
now-a-days are of our way of thinking, rather than on the heretical
side. So that the apostle would not in such a passage as the present one
have refrained from remarking and censuring the diversity.  Since,
however, there is no blame of a diversity, there is no proof of a
novelty. Of course <span id="fr_6100"></span>[6101](#fn_6100) the
Marcionites suppose that they have the apostle on their side in the
following passage in the matter of Christ’s substance—that in Him there
was nothing but a phantom of flesh. For he says of Christ, that, “being
in the form of God, He thought it not robbery to be equal with
God; <span id="fr_6101"></span>[6102](#fn_6101) but emptied <span
id="fr_6102"></span>[6103](#fn_6102) Himself, and took upon Him the
*form* of a servant,” *not the reality*, “and was made in the *likeness*
of man,” *not a man*, “and was found in *fashion* as a man,” <span
id="fr_6103"></span>[6104](#fn_6103) *not in his substance*, that is to
say, his flesh; just as if to a sub<span id="page_473">p. 473</span>
<span id="v.iv.vi.xx-Page_473"></span>stance there did not accrue both
*form* and *likeness* and *fashion*. It is well for us that in another
passage (the apostle) calls Christ “the image of the invisible
God.” <span id="fr_6104"></span>[6105](#fn_6104) For will it not follow
with equal force from that passage, that Christ is not truly God,
because the apostle places Him in *the image* of God, if, (as Marcion
contends,) He is not truly man because of His having taken on Him *the
form* or *image* of a man? For in both cases the true substance will
have to be excluded, if *image* (or “fashion”) and *likeness* and *form*
shall be claimed for a phantom. But since he is truly God, as the Son of
the Father, in His fashion and image, He has been already by the force
of this conclusion determined to be truly man, as the Son of man, “found
in the fashion” and image “of a man.”  For when he propounded <span
id="fr_6105"></span>[6106](#fn_6105) Him as thus “*found*” in the
manner <span id="fr_6106"></span>[6107](#fn_6106) of a man, he *in fact*
affirmed Him to be most certainly human. For what is *found*, manifestly
possesses existence. Therefore, as He was found to be God by His mighty
power, so was He found to be man by reason of His flesh, because the
apostle could not have pronounced Him to have “become obedient unto
death,” <span id="fr_6107"></span>[6108](#fn_6107) if He had not been
constituted of a mortal substance. Still more plainly does this appear
from the apostle’s additional words, “even the death of the
cross.” <span id="fr_6108"></span>[6109](#fn_6108) For he could hardly
mean this to be a climax <span id="fr_6109"></span>[6110](#fn_6109) to
the human suffering, to extol the virtue <span
id="fr_6110"></span>[6111](#fn_6110) of His obedience, if he had known
it all to be the imaginary process of a phantom, which rather eluded the
cross than experienced it, and which displayed no virtue <span
id="fr_6111"></span>[6112](#fn_6111) in the suffering, but only
illusion. But “those things which he had once accounted gain,” and which
he enumerates in the preceding verse—“trust in the flesh,” the sign of
“circumcision,” his origin as “an Hebrew of the Hebrews,” his descent
from “the tribe of Benjamin,” his dignity in the honours of the
Pharisee <span id="fr_6112"></span>[6113](#fn_6112) —he now reckons to
be only “loss” to himself; <span id="fr_6113"></span>[6114](#fn_6113)
(in other words,) it was not the God of the Jews, but their stupid
obduracy, which he repudiates. These are also the things “which he
counts but dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ” <span
id="fr_6114"></span>[6115](#fn_6114) (but by no means for the rejection
of God the Creator); “whilst he has not his own righteousness, which is
of the law, but that which is through Him,” *i.e.* Christ, “the
righteousness which is of God.” <span
id="fr_6115"></span>[6116](#fn_6115) Then, say you, according to this
distinction the law did not proceed from the God of Christ.  Subtle
enough! But here is something still more subtle for you. For when (the
apostle) says, “Not (the righteousness) which is of the law, but that
which is through Him,” he would not have used the phrase *through Him*
of any other than Him to whom the law belonged. “Our conversation,” says
he, “is in heaven.” <span id="fr_6116"></span>[6117](#fn_6116) I here
recognise the Creator’s ancient promise to Abraham: “I will multiply thy
seed as the stars of heaven.” <span id="fr_6117"></span>[6118](#fn_6117)
Therefore “one star differeth from another star in glory.” <span
id="fr_6118"></span>[6119](#fn_6118) If, again, Christ in His advent
from heaven “shall change the body of our humiliation, that it may be
fashioned like unto His glorious body,” <span
id="fr_6119"></span>[6120](#fn_6119) it follows that this body of ours
shall rise again, which is now in a state of humiliation in its
sufferings and according to the law of mortality drops into the ground.
But how shall it be changed, if it shall have no real existence? If,
however, this is only said of those who shall be found in the
flesh <span id="fr_6120"></span>[6121](#fn_6120) at the advent of God,
and who shall have to be changed,” <span
id="fr_6121"></span>[6122](#fn_6121) what shall they do who will rise
first?  They will have no substance from which to undergo a change. But
he says (elsewhere), “We shall be caught up together with them in the
clouds, to meet the Lord (in the air).” <span
id="fr_6122"></span>[6123](#fn_6122) Then, if we are to be caught up
alone with them, surely we shall likewise be changed together with them.
