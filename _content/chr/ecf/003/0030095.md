<span id="iv.v.xi-p2"></span>In fulfilment of our plan, let us now go on
to consider the combats.  Their origin is akin to that of the games
(*ludi*). Hence they are kept as either sacred or funereal, as they have
been instituted in honour of the idol-gods of the nations or of the
dead.  Thus, too, they are called Olympian in honour of Jupiter, known
at Rome as the Capitoline; Nemean, in honour of Hercules; Isthmian, in
honour of Neptune; the rest *mortuarii*, as belonging to the dead. What
wonder, then, if idolatry pollutes the combat-parade with profane
crowns, with sacerdotal chiefs, with attendants belonging to the various
colleges, last of all with the blood of its sacrifices? To add a
completing word about the “place”—in the common place for the college of
the arts sacred to the Muses, and Apollo, and Minerva, and also for that
of the arts dedicated to Mars, they with contest and sound of trumpet
emulate the circus in the arena, which is a real temple—I mean of the
god whose festivals it celebrates. The gymnastic arts also originated
with their Castors, and Herculeses, and Mercuries.
