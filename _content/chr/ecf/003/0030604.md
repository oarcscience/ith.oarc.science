<span id="v.viii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—The Scriptures Forbid Our
Supposing Either that the Resurrection is Already Past, or that It Takes
Place Immediately at Death. Our Hopes and Prayers Point to the Last
Great Day as the Period of Its Accomplishment.</span>

<span id="v.viii.xxii-p2"></span>We must after all this turn our
attention to those scriptures also which forbid our belief in such a
resurrection as is held by your *Animalists* (for I will not call them
*Spiritualists*), <span id="fr_7411"></span>[7412](#fn_7411) that it is
either to be assumed *as taking place* now, as soon as men come to the
knowledge of the truth, or else that it is accomplished immediately
after their departure from this life. Now, forasmuch as the seasons of
our entire hope have been fixed in the Holy Scripture, and since we are
not permitted to place the accomplishment thereof, as I apprehend,
previous to Christ’s coming, our prayers are directed towards <span
id="fr_7412"></span>[7413](#fn_7412) the end of this world, to the
passing away thereof at the great day of the Lord—of His wrath and
vengeance—the last day, which is hidden (from all), and known to none
but the Father, although announced beforehand by signs and wonders, and
the dissolution of the elements, and the conflicts of nations. I would
turn out the words of the prophets, if the Lord Himself had said nothing
(except that prophecies were the Lord’s own word); but it is more to my
purpose that He by His own mouth confirms *their statement*. Being
questioned by His disciples when those things were to come to pass which
He had just been uttering about the destruction of the temple, He
discourses to them first of the order of Jewish events until the
overthrow of Jerusalem, and then of such as concerned all nations up to
the very end of the world.  For after He had declared that “Jerusalem
was to be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles
should be fulfilled,” <span id="fr_7413"></span>[7414](#fn_7413)
—meaning, of course, those which were to be chosen of God, and gathered
in with the remnant of Israel—He then goes on to proclaim, against this
world and dispensation (even as Joel had done, and Daniel, and all the
prophets with one consent <span id="fr_7414"></span>[7415](#fn_7414) ),
that “there should be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
stars, distress of nations with perplexity, the sea and the waves
roaring, men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those
things which are coming on the <span id="page_561">p. 561</span> <span
id="v.viii.xxii-Page_561"></span>earth.” <span
id="fr_7415"></span>[7416](#fn_7415) “For,” says He, “the powers of
heaven shall be shaken; and then shall they see the Son of man coming in
the clouds, with power and great glory. And when these things begin to
come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption
draweth nigh.” <span id="fr_7416"></span>[7417](#fn_7416) He spake of
its “drawing nigh,” not of its being present already; and of “those
things beginning to come to pass,” not of their having happened: because
when they have come to pass, then our redemption shall be at hand, which
is said to be approaching up to that time, raising and exciting our
minds to what is then the proximate harvest of our hope. He immediately
annexes a parable of this in “the trees which are tenderly sprouting
into a flower-stalk, and then developing the flower, which is the
precursor of the fruit.” <span id="fr_7417"></span>[7418](#fn_7417) “So
likewise ye,” (He adds), “when ye shall see all these things come to
pass, know ye that the kingdom of heaven is nigh at hand.” <span
id="fr_7418"></span>[7419](#fn_7418) “Watch ye, therefore, *and pray*
always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all those things, and
to stand before the Son of man;” <span
id="fr_7419"></span>[7420](#fn_7419) that is, no doubt, at the
resurrection, after all these things have been previously transacted.
Therefore, although there is a sprouting in the acknowledgment of all
this mystery, yet it is only in the actual presence of the Lord that the
flower is developed and the fruit borne. Who is it then, that has
aroused the Lord, now at God’s right hand, so unseasonably and with such
severity “shake terribly” (as Isaiah <span
id="fr_7420"></span>[7421](#fn_7420) expresses it) “that earth,” which,
I suppose, is as yet unshattered? Who has thus early put “Christ’s
enemies beneath His feet” (to use the language of David <span
id="fr_7421"></span>[7422](#fn_7421) ), making Him more hurried than the
Father, whilst every crowd in our popular assemblies is still with
shouts consigning “the Christians to the lions?” <span
id="fr_7422"></span>[7423](#fn_7422) Who has yet beheld Jesus descending
from heaven in like manner as the apostles saw Him ascend, according to
the appointment of the *two* angels? <span
id="fr_7423"></span>[7424](#fn_7423) Up to the present moment they have
not, tribe by tribe, smitten their breasts, looking on Him whom they
pierced. <span id="fr_7424"></span>[7425](#fn_7424) No one has as yet
fallen in with Elias; <span id="fr_7425"></span>[7426](#fn_7425) no one
has as yet escaped from Antichrist; <span
id="fr_7426"></span>[7427](#fn_7426) no one has as yet had to bewail the
downfall of Babylon. <span id="fr_7427"></span>[7428](#fn_7427) And is
there now anybody who has risen again, except the heretic? *He*, of
course, has already quitted the grave of his own corpse—although he is
even now liable to fevers and ulcers; he, too, has already trodden down
his enemies—although he has even now to struggle with the powers of the
world. And as a matter of course, he is already a king—although he even
now owes to Cæsar the things which are Cæsar’s. <span
