<span id="v.viii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.viii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Some Truths Held Even by the
Heathen. They Were, However, More Often Wrong Both in Religious Opinions
and in Moral Practice.  The Heathen Not to Be Followed in Their
Ignorance of the Christian Mystery. The Heretics Perversely Prone to
Follow Them.</span>

<span id="v.viii.iii-p2"></span>One may no doubt be wise in the things
of God, even from one’s natural powers, but only in witness to the
truth, not in maintenance of error; (only) when one acts in accordance
with, not in opposition to, the divine dispensation.  For some things
are known even by nature: the immortality of the soul, for instance, is
held by many; the knowledge of our God is possessed by all. I may use,
therefore, the opinion of a Plato, when he declares, “Every soul is
immortal.”  I may use also the conscience of a nation, when it attests
the God of gods. I may, in like manner, use all the other intelligences
of our common nature, when they pronounce God to be a judge. “God sees,”
(say they); and, “I commend you to God.” <span
id="fr_7307"></span>[7308](#fn_7307) But when they say, “What has
undergone death is dead,” and, “Enjoy life whilst you live,” and, “After
death all things come to an end, even death itself;” then I must
remember both that “the heart of man is ashes,” <span
id="fr_7308"></span>[7309](#fn_7308) according to the estimate of God,
and that the very “Wisdom of the world is foolishness,” (as the inspired
word) pronounces it to be. <span id="fr_7309"></span>[7310](#fn_7309)
Then, if even the heretic seek refuge in the depraved thoughts of the
vulgar, or the imaginations of the world, I must say to him: Part
company with the heathen, O heretic! for although you are all agreed in
imagining a God, yet while you do so in the name of Christ, so long as
you deem yourself a Christian, you are a different man from a heathen:
give him back his own views of things, since he does not himself learn
from yours. Why lean upon a blind guide, if you have eyes of your own?
Why be clothed by one who is naked, if you have put on Christ? Why use
the shield of another, when the apostle gives you armour of your own? It
would be better for him to learn from you to acknowledge the
resurrection of the flesh, than for you from him to deny it; because if
Christians must needs deny it, it would be sufficient if they did so
from their own knowledge, without any instruction from the ignorant
multitude. He, therefore, will not be a Christian who shall deny this
doctrine which is confessed by Christians; denying it, moreover, on
grounds which are adopted by a man who is not a Christian. Take away,
indeed, from the heretics the wisdom which they share with the heathen,
and let them support their inquiries from the Scriptures alone:  they
will then be unable to keep their ground. For that which commends men’s
common sense is its very simplicity, and its participation in the same
feelings, and its community of opinions; and it is deemed to be all the
more trustworthy, inasmuch as its definitive statements are naked and
open, and known to all. Divine reason, on the contrary, lies in the very
pith and mar<span id="page_548">p. 548</span> <span
id="v.viii.iii-Page_548"></span>row of things, not on the surface, and
very often is at variance with appearances.
