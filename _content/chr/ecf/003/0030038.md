<span id="iv.iii.xxxii-p2"></span>There is also another and a greater
necessity for our offering prayer in behalf of the emperors, nay, for
the complete stability of the empire, and for Roman interests in
general. For we know that a mighty shock im<span id="page_43">p.
43</span> <span id="iv.iii.xxxii-Page_43"></span>pending over the whole
earth—in fact, the very end of all things threatening dreadful woes—is
only retarded by the continued existence of the Roman empire. <span
id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121) We have no desire, then, to be
overtaken by these dire events; and in praying that their coming may be
delayed, we are lending our aid to Rome’s duration. More than this,
though we decline to swear by the genii of the Cæsars, we swear by their
safety, which is worth far more than all your genii. Are you ignorant
that these genii are called “Dæmones,” and thence the diminutive name
“Dæmonia” is applied to them? We respect in the emperors the ordinance
of God, who has set them over the nations.  We know that there is that
in them which God has willed; and to what God has willed we desire all
safety, and we count an oath by it a great oath. But as for demons, that
is, your genii, we have been in the habit of exorcising them, not of
swearing by them, and thereby conferring on them divine honour.
