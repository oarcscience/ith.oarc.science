<p class="c19"><a name="vi.iv.iv-p2"></A>According to this model,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8782"></A><A HREF="#fn_8782"><FONT SIZE="1">8783</FONT></A>
 we subjoin, &#8220;Thy will be done in the heavens and on the earth;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8783"></A><A HREF="#fn_8783"><FONT SIZE="1">8784</FONT></A>
 not that there is some power withstanding&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8784"></A><A HREF="#fn_8784"><FONT SIZE="1">8785</FONT></A>
 to prevent God&#146;s will being done, and we pray for Him the successful achievement of His will; but we pray for His will to be done <i>in all</i>.&#160; For, by figurative interpretation of <i>flesh</i> and <i>spirit, we</i> are &#8220;heaven&#8221; and &#8220;earth;&#8221; albeit, even if it is to be understood simply, still the sense of the petition is the same, that <i>in us</i> God&#146;s will be done on earth, to make it possible, namely, for it to be done also in the heavens. What, moreover, <i>does</i> God will, but that we should walk according to His Discipline? We make petition, then, that He supply us with the substance of His will, and the capacity to do it, that we may be saved both in the heavens and on earth; because the sum of His will is the salvation of them whom He has adopted. There is, too, that will of God which the Lord accomplished in preaching, in working, in enduring: for if He Himself proclaimed that He did not His own, but the Father&#146;s will, without doubt those things which He used to do <i>were</i> the Father&#146;s will;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8785"></A><A HREF="#fn_8785"><FONT SIZE="1">8786</FONT></A>
 unto which things, as unto exemplars, we are now provoked;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8786"></A><A HREF="#fn_8786"><FONT SIZE="1">8787</FONT></A>
 to preach, to work, to endure even <A NAME="page_683"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 683</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.iv-Page_683"></A>unto death. And we <i>need</i> the will of God, that we may be able to fulfil these duties. Again, in saying, &#8220;Thy will be done,&#8221; we are even wishing well to ourselves, in so far that there is nothing of <i>evil</i> in the will of God; even if, proportionably to each one&#146;s deserts, somewhat other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8787"></A><A HREF="#fn_8787"><FONT SIZE="1">8788</FONT></A>
 is imposed on us. So by this expression we premonish our own selves unto patience.&#160; The Lord also, when He had wished to demonstrate to us, even in His own flesh, the flesh&#146;s infirmity, by the reality of suffering, said, &#8220;Father, remove this Thy cup;&#8221; and remembering Himself, <i>added</i>, &#8220;save that not my will, but Thine be done.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8788"></A><A HREF="#fn_8788"><FONT SIZE="1">8789</FONT></A>
 Himself <i>was</i> the Will and the Power of the Father:&#160; and yet, for the demonstration of the patience which was due, He gave Himself up <i>to</i> the Father&#146;s Will.</p>
