<span id="iv.xi.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—In Opposition to Plato, the Soul
Was Created and Originated at Birth.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.iv-p2"></span>After settling the origin of the soul, its
condition or state comes up next.  For when we acknowledge that the soul
originates in the breath of God, it follows that we attribute a
beginning to it.  This Plato, indeed, refuses to assign to it, for he
will have the soul to be unborn and unmade. <span
id="fr_1521"></span>[1522](#fn_1521) We, however, from the very fact of
its having had a beginning, as well as from the nature thereof, teach
that it had both birth and creation. And when we ascribe both birth and
creation to it, we have made no mistake: for being *born*, indeed, is
one thing, and being *made* is another,—the former being the term which
is best suited to living beings. When distinctions, however, have places
and times of their own, they occasionally possess also reciprocity of
application among themselves. Thus, the being made admits of being taken
in the sense of being brought forth; <span
id="fr_1522"></span>[1523](#fn_1522) inasmuch as everything which
receives *being* or *existence*, in any way whatever, is in fact
generated. For the maker may really be called the parent of the thing
that is made: in this sense Plato also uses the phraseology. So far,
therefore, as concerns our belief in the souls being made or born, the
opinion of the philosopher is overthrown by the authority of
prophecy <span id="fr_1523"></span>[1524](#fn_1523) even.
