<span id="iv.viii.ii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—The Power of Rome. Romanized
Aspect of All the Heathen Mythology. Varro’s Threefold Distribution
Criticised. Roman Heroes (Æneas Included,) Unfavourably Reviewed.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.ix-p2"></span>Such are the more obvious or more
remarkable points which we had to mention in connection with Varro’s
threefold distribution of the gods, in order that a sufficient answer
might seem to be given touching the physical, the poetic, and the
gentile classes. Since, however, it is no longer to the philosophers,
nor the poets, nor the nations that we owe the substitution of all
(heathen worship for the true religion) although they transmitted the
superstition, but to the dominant Romans, who received the tradition and
gave it wide authority, another phase of the widespread error of man
must now be encountered by us; nay, another forest must be felled *by
our axe*, which has obscured the childhood of the degenerate
worship <span id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921) with germs of
superstitions gathered from all quarters. Well, but even the gods of the
Romans have received from (the same) Varro a threefold classification
into the *certain*, the *uncertain*, and the *select*. What absurdity!
What need had they of uncertain gods, when they possessed certain ones?
Unless, forsooth, they wished to commit themselves to <span
id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922) such folly as the Athenians did; for
at Athens there was an altar with this inscription: “<span
class="sc"><span id="iv.viii.ii.ix-p4.1"></span>To the unknown
gods</span>.” <span id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923) Does, then, a man
worship that which he knows nothing of? Then, again, as they had certain
gods, they ought to have been contented with them, without requiring
select ones. In this want they are even found to be irreligious! For if
gods are selected as onions are, <span id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924)
then such as are not chosen are declared to be worthless. Now we on our
part allow that the Romans had two sets of gods, *common* and *proper*;
in other words, those which they had in common with other nations, and
those which they themselves devised. And were not these called the
*public* and the *foreign* <span id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925) gods?
Their altars tell us so; there is (a specimen) of the foreign gods at
the fane of Carna, of the public gods in the Palatium. Now, since their
common gods are comprehended in both the physical and the mythic
classes, we have already said enough concerning them. I should like to
speak of their particular kinds of deity. We ought then to admire the
Romans for that third set of *the gods of their enemies*, <span
id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926) because no other nation ever
discovered for itself so large a mass of superstition. Their other
deities we arrange in two classes: those which have become gods from
human beings, and those which have had their origin in some other way.
Now, since there is advanced the same colourable pretext for the
deification of the dead, that their lives were meritorious, we are
compelled to urge the same reply against them, that no one of them was
worth so much <span id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.ix-Page_138"></span>pains.  Their fond <span
id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927) father Æneas, in whom they believed,
was never glorious, and was felled with a stone <span
id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928) —a vulgar weapon, to pelt a dog
withal, inflicting a wound no less ignoble! But this Æneas turns
out <span id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929) a traitor to his country;
yes, quite as much as Antenor. And if they will not believe this to be
true of him, he at any rate deserted his companions when his country was
in flames, and must be held inferior to that woman of Carthage, <span
id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930) who, when her husband Hasdrubal
supplicated the enemy with the mild pusillanimity of our Æneas, refused
to accompany him, but hurrying her children along with her, disdained to
take her beautiful self and father’s noble heart <span
id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931) into exile, but plunged into the
flames of the burning Carthage, as if rushing into the embraces of her
(dear but) ruined country. Is he “pious Æneas” for (rescuing) his young
only son and decrepit old father, but deserting Priam and Astyanax? But
the Romans ought rather to detest him; for in defence of their princes
and their royal <span id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932) house, they
surrender <span id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933) even children and
wives, and every dearest pledge. <span id="fr_934"></span>[935](#fn_934)
They deify the son of Venus, and this with the full knowledge and
consent of *her husband* Vulcan, and without opposition from even Juno.
Now, if sons have seats in heaven owing to their piety to their parents,
why are not those noble youths <span id="fr_935"></span>[936](#fn_935)
of Argos rather accounted gods, because they, to save their mother from
guilt in the performance of some sacred rites, with a devotion more than
human, yoked themselves to her car and dragged her to the temple? Why
not make a goddess, for her exceeding piety, of that daughter <span
id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936) who from her own breasts nourished her
father who was famishing in prison? What other glorious achievement can
be related of Æneas, but that he was nowhere seen in the fight on the
field of Laurentum? Following his bent, perhaps he fled a second time as
a fugitive from the battle. <span id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937) In
like manner, Romulus posthumously becomes a god. Was it because he
founded the city? Then why not others also, who have built cities,
counting even <span id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938) women? To be sure,
Romulus slew his brother in the bargain, and trickishly ravished some
foreign virgins. Therefore of course he becomes a god, and therefore a
Quirinus (“god of the spear”), because then their fathers had to use the
spear <span id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939) on his account. What did
Sterculus do to merit deification? If he worked hard to enrich the
fields *stercoribus*, <span id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940) (with
manure,) Augias had more dung than he to bestow on them. If Faunus, the
son of Picus, used to do violence to law and right, because struck with
madness, it was more fit that he should be doctored than deified. <span
id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941) If the daughter of Faunus so excelled
in chastity, that she would hold no conversation with men, it was
perhaps from rudeness, or a consciousness of deformity, or shame for her
father’s insanity. How much worthier of divine honour than this “good
goddess” <span id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942) was Penelope, who,
although dwelling among so many suitors of the vilest character,
preserved with delicate tact the purity which they assailed! There is
Sanctus, too, <span id="fr_943"></span>[944](#fn_943) who for his
hospitality had a temple consecrated to him by king Plotius; and even
Ulysses had it in his power to have bestowed one more god upon you in
the person of the most refined Alcinous.
