<span id="v.v.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—Other Speculations of
Hermogenes, About Matter and Some of Its Adjuncts, Shown to Be Absurd.
For Instance, Its Alleged Infinity.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxxviii-p2"></span>My observations touching the
*site* <span id="fr_6535"></span>[6536](#fn_6535) of Matter, as also
concerning its *mode* <span id="fr_6536"></span>[6537](#fn_6536) have
one and the same object in view—to meet and refute your perverse
positions. You put Matter below God, and thus, of course, you assign a
place to it below God. Therefore Matter is local. <span
id="fr_6537"></span>[6538](#fn_6537) Now, if it is local, it is within
locality; if within locality, it is bounded <span
id="fr_6538"></span>[6539](#fn_6538) by the place within which it is; if
it is bounded, it has an outline, <span
id="fr_6539"></span>[6540](#fn_6539) which (painter as you are in your
special vocation) you know is the boundary to every object susceptible
of outline.  Matter, therefore, cannot be infinite, which, since it is
in space, is bounded by space; and being thus determinable by space, it
is susceptible of an outline. You, however, make it infinite, when you
say: “It is on this account infinite, because it is always existent.” 
And if any of your disciples should choose to meet us by declaring your
meaning to be that Matter is infinite in time, not in its corporeal
mass, <span id="fr_6540"></span>[6541](#fn_6540) still what follows will
show that (you mean) corporeal infinity *to be an attribute of Matter*,
that it is in respect of bulk immense and uncircumscribed.  “Wherefore,”
say you, “it is not fabricated as a whole, but *in* its parts.” <span
id="fr_6541"></span>[6542](#fn_6541) In bulk, therefore, is it infinite,
not in time. And you contradict yourself <span
id="fr_6542"></span>[6543](#fn_6542) when you make *Matter* infinite in
bulk, and at the same time ascribe place to it, including it within
space and local outline. But yet at the same time I cannot tell why God
should not have entirely formed it, <span
id="fr_6543"></span>[6544](#fn_6543) unless it be because He was either
impotent or envious. I want therefore to know the moiety of that which
was not wholly formed (by God), in order that I may understand what kind
of thing the entirety was. It was only right that God should have made
it known as a model of antiquity, <span
id="fr_6544"></span>[6545](#fn_6544) to set off the glory of His work.

<span id="v.v.xxxviii-p4"></span> Oehler here restores the reading “quod
et de *modo*,” instead of “de *motu*,” for which Pamelius contends.
Oehler has the <span class="sc"><span
id="v.v.xxxviii-p4.2"></span>mss.</span> on his side, and Fr. Junius,
who interprets “*modo*” here to mean “mass or quantity.” Pamelius wishes
to suit the passage to the preceding context (see ch. xxxvi.); Junius
thinks it is meant rather to refer to what follows, by which it is
confirmed.

This perhaps means: “It is not its entirety, but its parts, which are
used in creation.”
