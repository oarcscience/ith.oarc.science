<span id="v.iv.iv.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—The Call of the Gentiles Under
the Influence of the Gospel Foretold.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.xxi-p2"></span>So you cannot get out of this notion of
yours a basis for your difference between the two Christs, as if the
Jewish Christ were ordained by the Creator for the restoration of the
people alone <span id="fr_3389"></span>[3390](#fn_3389) from its
dispersion, whilst yours was appointed by the supremely good God for the
liberation of the whole human race.  Because, after all, the earliest
Christians are found on the side of the Creator, not of Marcion, <span
id="fr_3390"></span>[3391](#fn_3390) all nations being called to His
kingdom, from the fact that God set up that kingdom from the tree (of
the cross), when no Cerdon was yet born, much less a Marcion. However,
when you are refuted on the call of the *nations*, you betake yourself
to *proselytes*. You ask, who among the nations can turn to the Creator,
when those whom the prophet names are proselytes of individually
different and private condition? <span
id="fr_3391"></span>[3392](#fn_3391) “Behold,” says Isaiah, “the
proselytes shall come unto me through Thee,” showing that they were even
proselytes who were to find their way to God through Christ.  But
nations (Gentiles) also, like ourselves, had likewise their mention (by
the prophet) as trusting in Christ.  “And in His name,” says he, “shall
the Gentiles trust.” Besides, the proselytes whom you substitute for the
nations in prophecy, are not in the habit of trusting in Christ’s name,
but in the dispensation of Moses, from whom comes their instruction. But
it was in the last days that the choice <span
id="fr_3392"></span>[3393](#fn_3392) of the nations had its
commencement. <span id="fr_3393"></span>[3394](#fn_3393) In these very
words Isaiah says: “And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the
mountain of the Lord,” that is, God’s eminence, “and the house of God,”
that is, Christ, the Catholic temple of God, in which God is worshipped,
“shall be established upon the mountains,” over all the eminences of
virtues and powers; “and all nations shall come unto it; and many people
shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
and to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us His way, and
we will walk in it: for out of Sion shall go forth the law, and the word
of the Lord from Jerusalem.” <span id="fr_3394"></span>[3395](#fn_3394)
The gospel will be this “way,” of the new law and the new word in
Christ, no longer in Moses.  “And He shall judge among the nations,”
even concerning their error. “And these shall rebuke a large nation,”
that of the Jews themselves and their proselytes.  “And they shall beat
their swords into ploughshares, and their spears <span
id="fr_3395"></span>[3396](#fn_3395) into prun<span id="page_340">p.
340</span> <span id="v.iv.iv.xxi-Page_340"></span>ing-hooks;” in other
words, they shall change into pursuits of moderation and peace the
dispositions of injurious minds, and hostile tongues, and all kinds of
evil, and blasphemy.  “Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,”
shall not stir up discord. “Neither shall they learn war any
more,” <span id="fr_3396"></span>[3397](#fn_3396) that is, the
provocation of hostilities; so that you here learn that Christ is
promised not as powerful in war, but pursuing peace. Now you must deny
either that these things were predicted, although they are plainly seen,
or that they have been accomplished, although you read of them; else, if
you cannot deny either one fact or the other, they must have been
accomplished in Him of whom they were predicted. For look at the entire
course of His call up to the present time from its beginning, how it is
addressed to the nations (Gentiles) who are in these last days
approaching to God the Creator, and not to proselytes, whose
election <span id="fr_3397"></span>[3398](#fn_3397) was rather an event
of the earliest days.  Verily the apostles have annulled <span
id="fr_3398"></span>[3399](#fn_3398) that belief of yours.
