<span id="vi.ii.i-p6"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vi.ii.i-p6.1"></span>Chapter I.—Of Heathen Repentance.</span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.ii.i-p7.1"></span>Repentance</span>, men understand, so far as
nature is able, to be an emotion of the mind arising from disgust <span
id="fr_8420"></span>[8421](#fn_8420) at some *previously cherished*
worse sentiment: that kind of men *I mean* which even we ourselves were
in days gone by—blind, without the Lord’s light.  From the *reason* of
repentance, however, they are just as far as they are from the Author of
reason Himself. *Reason*, in fact, is a thing of God, inasmuch as there
is nothing which God the Maker of all has not provided, disposed,
ordained *by reason*—nothing which He has not willed should be handled
and understood *by reason*. All, therefore, who are ignorant of God,
must necessarily be ignorant also of a thing which is His, because no
treasure-house <span id="fr_8421"></span>[8422](#fn_8421) at all is
accessible to strangers. And thus, voyaging all the universal course of
life without the rudder of reason, they know not how to shun the
hurricane which is impending over the world. <span
id="fr_8422"></span>[8423](#fn_8422) Moreover, how irrationally they
behave in the practice of repentance, it will be enough briefly to show
just by this one fact, that they exercise it even in the case of their
*good* deeds. They repent of good faith, of love, of simple-heartedness,
of patience, of mercy, just in proportion as any deed *prompted by these
feelings* has fallen on thankless soil.  They execrate their own selves
for having done good; and that species chiefly of repentance which is
applied to the best works they fix in their heart, making it their care
to remember never again to do a good turn. On repentance for *evil*
deeds, on the contrary, they lay lighter stress. In short, they make
this same (virtue) a means of *sinning* more readily than a means of
*right-doing*.
