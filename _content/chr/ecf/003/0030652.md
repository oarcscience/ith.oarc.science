<span id="v.ix.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—The Evolution of the Son or Word of
God from the Father by a Divine Procession. Illustrated by the Operation
of the Human Thought and Consciousness.</span>

<span id="v.ix.v-p2"></span>But since they will have the Two to be but
One, so that the Father shall be deemed to be the same as the Son, it is
only right that the whole question respecting the Son should be
examined, as to whether He exists, and who He is and the mode of His
existence. Thus shall the truth itself <span
id="fr_7802"></span>[7803](#fn_7802) secure its own sanction <span
id="fr_7803"></span>[7804](#fn_7803) from the Scriptures, and the
interpretations which guard <span id="fr_7804"></span>[7805](#fn_7804)
them. There are some who allege that even Genesis opens thus in Hebrew:
“In the beginning God made for Himself a Son.” <span
id="fr_7805"></span>[7806](#fn_7805) As there is no ground for this, I
am led to other arguments derived from God’s own dispensation, <span
id="fr_7806"></span>[7807](#fn_7806) in which He existed before the
creation of the world, up to the generation of the Son. For before all
things God was alone—being in Himself and for Himself universe, and
space, and all things. Moreover, He was alone, because there was nothing
external to Him but Himself.  Yet even not then was He alone; for He had
with Him that which He possessed in Himself, that is to say, His own
Reason. For God is rational, and Reason was first in Him; and so all
things were from Himself.  This Reason is His own Thought (or
Consciousness) <span id="fr_7807"></span>[7808](#fn_7807) which the
Greeks call <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ix.v-p8.1"></span>λόγος</span>, by which term we also designate
Word *or Discourse* <span id="fr_7808"></span>[7809](#fn_7808) and
therefore it is now usual with our people, owing to the mere simple
interpretation of the term, to say that the Word <span
id="fr_7809"></span>[7810](#fn_7809) was in the beginning with God;
although it would be more suitable to regard Reason as the more ancient;
because God had not Word <span id="fr_7810"></span>[7811](#fn_7810) from
the beginning, but He had Reason <span
id="fr_7811"></span>[7812](#fn_7811) even before the beginning; because
also Word itself consists of Reason, which it thus proves to have been
the prior existence as being its own substance. <span
id="fr_7812"></span>[7813](#fn_7812) Not that this distinction is of any
practical moment. For although God had not yet sent *out* His
Word, <span id="fr_7813"></span>[7814](#fn_7813) He still had Him within
Himself, both in company with and included within His very Reason, as He
silently planned and arranged within Himself everything which He was
afterwards about to utter <span id="fr_7814"></span>[7815](#fn_7814)
through His Word. Now, whilst He was thus planning and arranging with
His own Reason, He was actually causing that to become Word which He was
dealing with in the way of Word *or Discourse*. <span
id="fr_7815"></span>[7816](#fn_7815) And that you may the more readily
understand this, consider first of all, from your own self, who are made
“in the image and likeness of God,” <span
id="fr_7816"></span>[7817](#fn_7816) for what purpose it is that you
also possess reason in yourself, who are a rational creature, as being
not only made by a rational Artificer, but actually animated out of His
substance. Observe, then, that when you are silently con<span
id="page_601">p. 601</span> <span id="v.ix.v-Page_601"></span>versing
with yourself, this very process is carried on within you by your
reason, which meets you with a word at every movement of your thought,
at every impulse of your conception. Whatever you think, there is a
word; whatever you conceive, there is reason.  You must needs speak it
in your mind; and while you are speaking, you admit speech as an
interlocutor with you, involved in which there is this very reason,
whereby, while in thought you are holding converse with your word, you
are (by reciprocal action) producing thought by means of that converse
with your word. Thus, in a certain sense, the word is a second *person*
within you, through which in thinking you utter speech, and through
which also, (by reciprocity of process,) in uttering speech you generate
thought. The word is itself a different thing from yourself. Now how
much more fully is all this transacted in God, whose image and likeness
even you are regarded as being, inasmuch as He has reason within Himself
even while He is silent, and involved in that Reason His Word! I may
therefore without rashness first lay this down (as a fixed principle)
that even then before the creation of the universe God was not alone,
since He had within Himself both Reason, and, inherent in Reason, His
Word, which He made second to Himself by agitating it within Himself.
