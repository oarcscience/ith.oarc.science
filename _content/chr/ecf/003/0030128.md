<span id="iv.vi.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.vi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.xiii-p2"></span>For state reasons, the various orders of
the citizens also are crowned with laurel crowns; but the magistrates
besides with golden ones, as at Athens, and at Rome. Even to those are
preferred the Etruscan. This appellation is given to the crowns which,
distinguished by their gems and oak leaves of gold, they put on, with
mantles having an embroidery of palm branches, to conduct the chariots
containing the images of the gods to the circus. There are also
provincial crowns of gold, needing now the larger heads of images
instead of those of men. But your orders, and your magistracies, and
your very place of meeting, the church, are Christ’s. You belong to Him,
for you have been enrolled in the books of life. <span
id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427) There the blood of the Lord serves for
your purple robe, and your broad stripe is His own cross; there the axe
is already laid to the trunk of the tree; <span
id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428) there is the branch out of the root of
Jesse. <span id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429) Never mind the state
horses with their crown. Your Lord, when, according to the Scripture, He
would enter Jerusalem in triumph, had not even an ass of His own. These
(put their trust) in chariots, and these in horses; but we will seek our
help in the name of the Lord our God. <span
id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430) From so much as a dwelling in that
Babylon of John’s Revelation <span id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431) we
are called away; much more then from its pomp. The rabble, too, are
crowned, at one time because of some great rejoicing for the success of
the emperors; at another, on account of some custom belonging to
municipal festivals. For luxury strives to make her own every occasion
of public gladness. But as for you, you are a foreigner in this world, a
citizen of Jerusalem, the city above. Our citizenship, the apostle says,
is in heaven. <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432) You have your own
registers, your own calendar; you have nothing to do with the joys of
the world; nay, you are called to the very opposite, for “the world
shall rejoice, but ye shall mourn.” <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433) And I think the Lord affirms, that
those who mourn are happy, not those who are crowned.  Marriage, too,
decks the bridegroom with its crown; and therefore we will not have
heathen brides, lest they seduce us even to the idolatry with which
among them marriage is initiated.  You have the law from the patriarchs
indeed; you have the apostle enjoining people to marry in the
Lord. <span id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434) You have a crowning also
on the making of a freeman; but *you* have been already ransomed by
Christ, and that at a great price.  How shall the world manumit the
servant of another? Though it seems to be liberty, yet it will come to
be found bondage. In the world everything is nominal, and nothing real. 
For even then, as ransomed by Christ, you were under no bondage to man;
and now, though man has given you liberty, you are the servant of
Christ. If you think freedom of the world to be real, so that you even
seal it with a crown, you have returned <span id="page_102">p.
102</span> <span id="iv.vi.xiii-Page_102"></span>to the slavery of man,
imagining it to be freedom; you have lost the freedom of Christ,
fancying it is slavery. Will there be any dispute as to the cause of
crown-wearing, which contests in the games in their turn supply, and
which, both as sacred to the gods and in honour of the dead, their own
reason at once condemns? It only remains, that the Olympian Jupiter, and
the Nemean Hercules, and the wretched little Archemorus, and the hapless
Antinous, should be crowned in a Christian, that he himself may become a
spectacle disgusting to behold. We have recounted, as I think, all the
various causes of the wearing of the crown, and there is not one which
has any place with us: all are foreign to us, unholy, unlawful, having
been abjured already once for all in the solemn declaration of the
sacrament. For they were of the pomp of the devil and his angels,
offices of the world, <span id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435) honours,
festivals, popularity huntings, false vows, exhibitions of human
servility, empty praises, base glories, and in them all idolatry, even
in respect of the origin of the crowns alone, with which they are all
wreathed. Claudius will tell us in his preface, indeed, that in the
poems of Homer the heaven also is crowned with constellations, and that
no doubt by God, no doubt for man; therefore man himself, too, should be
crowned by God.  But the world crowns brothels, and baths, and
bakehouses, and prisons, and schools, and the very amphitheatres, and
the chambers where the clothes are stripped from dead gladiators, and
the very biers of the dead. How sacred and holy, how venerable and pure
is this article of dress, determine not from the heaven of poetry alone,
but from the traffickings of the whole world.  But indeed a Christian
will not even dishonour his own gate with laurel crowns, if so be he
knows how many gods the devil has attached to doors; Janus so-called
from gate, Limentinus from threshold, Forcus and Carna from leaves and
hinges; among the Greeks, too, the Thyræan Apollo, and the evil spirits,
the Antelii.
