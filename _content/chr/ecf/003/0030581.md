<span id="v.vii.xxvi-p5"></span>The learned John Scott, in his
invaluable work *The Christian Life*, <span
id="fr_7282"></span>[7283](#fn_7282) identifies the glory shed upon the
Saviour at his baptism, with that mentioned by [Ezek.
43.2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002)<span id="v.vii.xxvi-p6.1"></span>
and adds: “In this same glorious splendor was Christ arrayed first at
his Baptism and afterward at his Transfiguration.…By the Holy Ghost’s
descending *like a Dove*, it is not necessary we should understand his
descending in the shape or form of a Dove, but that in some glorious
form, or appearance, he descended in the same manner as a Dove
descends.…Came down from above just as a dove with his wings spread
forth is observed to do, <span id="page_543">p. 543</span> <span
id="v.vii.xxvi-Page_543"></span>and lighted upon our Saviour’s head.” I
quote this as the opinion of one of the most learned and orthodox of
divines, but not as my own, for I cannot reconcile it, as he strives to
do, with St. [Luke iii. 22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022)<span
id="v.vii.xxvi-p6.2"></span>. Compare Justin Martyr, vol. i. p. 243, and
note 6, this series. Grotius observes, says Dr. Scott, that in the
apocryphal *Gospel of the Nazarenes*, it is said that at the Baptism of
our Lord “a great light shone round about the place.”

<span id="v.vii.xxvi-p8"></span>(His mother and His brethren, cap. vii.
p. 527.)

<span id="v.vii.xxvi-p9"></span>It is not possible that the author of
this chapter had ever conceived of the Blessed Virgin otherwise than as
“Blessed among women,” indeed, but enjoying no especial prerogative as
the mother of our Lord. He speaks of “denying her” and “putting her
away” after He began His Ministry, as He requires His ministers to do,
after His example. How extraordinary this language—“the repudiation of
carnal relationship.”  According to our author, never charged with
heresy on this point, the high rewards of the holy Mary, in the world to
come will be those due to her faith, not to the blessing of “her breasts
and of her womb.” Christ designates those as “more blessed,” who hear
His word and keep it. This the Blessed Virgin did pre-eminently, and
herein was her own greater blessedness; that is, (our author shews) her
crown of glory depends chiefly, like that of other saints, on her faith
and works, not on her mere Maternity.
