<span id="v.ix.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The Identity of the Father and the
Son, as Praxeas Held It, Shown to Be Full of Perplexity and Absurdity.
Many Scriptures Quoted in Proof of the Distinction of the Divine Persons
of the Trinity.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xi-p2"></span>It will be your duty, however, to adduce
your proofs out of the Scriptures as plainly as we do, when we prove
that He made His Word a Son to Himself. For if He calls Him Son, and if
the Son is none other than He who has proceeded from *the Father*
Himself, and if the Word has proceeded from *the Father* Himself, He
will then be the Son, and not Himself from whom He proceeded. For *the
Father* Himself did not proceed from Himself. Now, you who say that the
Father is the same as the Son, do really make the same Person both to
have sent forth from Himself (and at the same time to have gone out from
Himself as) that Being which is God. If it was possible for Him to have
done this, He at all events did not do it. You must bring forth the
proof which I require of you—one like my own; that is, (you must prove
to me) that the Scriptures show the Son and the Father to be the same,
just as on our side the Father and the Son are demonstrated to be
distinct; I say *distinct*, but not *separate*: <span
id="fr_7874"></span>[7875](#fn_7874) for as on my part I produce the
words of God Himself, “My heart hath emitted my most excellent
Word,” <span id="fr_7875"></span>[7876](#fn_7875) so you in like manner
ought to adduce in opposition to me some text where God has said, “My
heart hath emitted Myself as my own most excellent Word,” in such a
sense that He is Himself both the Emitter and the Emitted, both He who
sent forth and He who was sent forth, since He is both the Word and God.
I bid you also observe, <span id="fr_7876"></span>[7877](#fn_7876) that
on my side I advance the passage where the Father said to the Son, “Thou
art my Son, this day have I begotten Thee.” <span
id="fr_7877"></span>[7878](#fn_7877) If you want me to believe Him to be
both the Father and the Son, show me some other passage where it is
declared, “The Lord said unto Himself, I am my own Son, to-day have I
begotten myself;” or again, “Before the morning did I beget
myself;” <span id="fr_7878"></span>[7879](#fn_7878) and likewise, “I the
Lord possessed Myself the beginning of my ways for my own works; before
all the hills, too, did I beget myself;” <span
id="fr_7879"></span>[7880](#fn_7879) and whatever other passages are to
the same effect. Why, moreover, could God the Lord of all things, have
hesitated to speak thus of Himself, if the fact had been so? Was He
afraid of not being believed, if He had in so many words declared
Himself to be both the Father and the Son? Of one thing He was at any
rate afraid—of lying. Of Himself, too, and of His own truth, was He
afraid. Believing Him, therefore, to be the true God, I am sure that He
declared nothing to exist in any other way than ac<span id="page_606">p.
606</span> <span id="v.ix.xi-Page_606"></span>cording to His own
dispensation and arrangement, and that He had arranged nothing in any
other way than according to His own declaration. On your side, however,
you must make Him out to be a liar, and an impostor, and a tamperer with
His word, if, when He was Himself a Son to Himself, He assigned the part
of His Son to be played by another, when all the Scriptures attest the
clear existence of, and distinction in (the Persons of) the Trinity, and
indeed furnish us with our Rule *of faith*, that He who speaks, and He
of whom He speaks, and to whom He speaks, cannot possibly seem to be One
and the Same. So absurd and misleading a statement would be unworthy of
God, that, when it was Himself to whom He was speaking, He speaks rather
to another, and not to His very self. Hear, then, other utterances also
of the Father concerning the Son by the mouth of Isaiah: “Behold my Son,
whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom I am well pleased: I will put my
Spirit upon Him, and He shall bring forth judgment to the
Gentiles.” <span id="fr_7880"></span>[7881](#fn_7880) Hear also what He
says to the Son: “Is it a great thing for Thee, that Thou shouldest be
called my Son to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the
dispersed of Israel? I have given Thee for a light to the Gentiles, that
Thou mayest be their salvation to the end of the earth.” <span
id="fr_7881"></span>[7882](#fn_7881) Hear now also the Son’s utterances
respecting the Father: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He
hath anointed me to preach the gospel unto men.” <span
id="fr_7882"></span>[7883](#fn_7882) He speaks of Himself likewise to
the Father in the Psalm: “Forsake me not until I have declared the might
of Thine arm to all the generation that is to come.” <span
id="fr_7883"></span>[7884](#fn_7883) Also to the same purport in another
Psalm: “O Lord, how are they increased that trouble me!” <span
id="fr_7884"></span>[7885](#fn_7884) But almost all the Psalms which
prophesy of <span id="fr_7885"></span>[7886](#fn_7885) the person of
Christ, represent the Son as conversing with the Father—that is,
*represent* Christ (as speaking) to God. Observe also the Spirit
speaking of the Father and the Son, in the character of <span
id="fr_7886"></span>[7887](#fn_7886) a third Person: “The Lord said unto
my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy
footstool.” <span id="fr_7887"></span>[7888](#fn_7887) Likewise in the
words of Isaiah: “Thus saith the Lord to the Lord <span
id="fr_7888"></span>[7889](#fn_7888) mine Anointed.” <span
id="fr_7889"></span>[7890](#fn_7889) Likewise, in the same prophet, He
says to the Father respecting the Son: “Lord, who hath believed our
report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We brought a report
concerning Him, as if He were a little child, as if He were a root in a
dry ground, who had no form nor comeliness.” <span
id="fr_7890"></span>[7891](#fn_7890) These are a few testimonies out of
many; for we do not pretend to bring up all the passages of Scripture,
because we have a tolerably large accumulation of them in the various
heads of our subject, as we in our several chapters call them in as our
witnesses in the fulness of their dignity and authority. <span
id="fr_7891"></span>[7892](#fn_7891) Still, in these few quotations the
distinction of *Persons in* the Trinity is clearly set forth. For there
is the Spirit Himself who speaks, and the Father to whom He speaks, and
the Son of whom He speaks. <span id="fr_7892"></span>[7893](#fn_7892) In
the same manner, the other passages also establish each one of several
Persons in His special character—addressed as they in some cases are to
the Father or to the Son respecting the Son, in other cases to the Son
or to the Father concerning the Father, and again in other instances to
the (Holy) Spirit.
