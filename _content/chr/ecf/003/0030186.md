<span id="iv.ix.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.ix.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Of Sacrifices.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.v-p2"></span>So, again, we show that sacrifices of
earthly oblations and of spiritual sacrifices <span
id="fr_1196"></span>[1197](#fn_1196) were predicted; and, moreover, that
from the beginning the earthly were foreshown, in the person of Cain, to
be those of the “elder son,” that is, of Israel; and the opposite
sacrifices demonstrated to be those of the “younger son,” Abel, that is,
of *our* people. For the elder, Cain, offered gifts to God from the
fruit of the earth; but the younger son, Abel, from the fruit of his
ewes. “God had respect unto Abel, and unto his gifts; but unto Cain and
unto his gifts He had not respect. And God said unto Cain, Why is thy
countenance fallen? hast thou not—if thou offerest indeed aright, but
dost not divide aright—sinned? Hold thy peace. For unto thee shalt thy
conversion be and he shall lord it over thee.  And then Cain said unto
Abel his brother, Let us go into the field: and he went away with him
thither, and he slew him. And then God said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy
brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper? To whom God
said, The voice of the blood of thy brother crieth forth unto me from
the earth. Wherefore cursed is the earth, which hath opened her mouth to
receive the blood of thy brother. Groaning and trembling shalt thou be
upon the earth, and every one who shall have found thee shall slay
thee.” <span id="fr_1197"></span>[1198](#fn_1197) From this proceeding
we gather that the twofold sacrifices of “the peoples” were even from
the very beginning foreshown. In short, when the sacerdotal law was
being drawn up, through Moses, in Leviticus, we find it prescribed to
the people of Israel that sacrifices should in no other place be offered
to God than in the land of promise; which the Lord God was about to give
to “the people” Israel and to their brethren, in order that, on Israel’s
introduction thither, there should there be celebrated sacrifices and
holocausts, as well for sins as for souls; and nowhere else but in the
holy land. <span id="fr_1198"></span>[1199](#fn_1198) Why, accordingly,
does the Spirit afterwards predict, through the prophets, that it should
come to pass that in every place and in every land there should be
offered sacrifices to God? as He says through the angel Malachi, one of
the twelve prophets:  “I will not receive sacrifice from your hands; for
from the rising sun unto the setting my Name hath been made famous among
all the nations, saith the Lord Almighty: and in every place they offer
clean sacrifices to my Name.” <span id="fr_1199"></span>[1200](#fn_1199)
Again, in the Psalms, David says: “Bring to God, ye countries of the
nations”—undoubtedly because “unto every land” the preaching of the
apostles had to “go out” <span id="fr_1200"></span>[1201](#fn_1200)
—“bring to God fame and honour; bring to God the sacrifices of His name:
take up <span id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201) victims and enter
into His courts.” <span id="fr_1202"></span>[1203](#fn_1202) For that it
is not by earthly sacrifices, but by spiritual, that offering is to be
made to God, we thus read, as it is written, An heart contribulate and
humbled is a victim for God;” <span id="fr_1203"></span>[1204](#fn_1203)
and elsewhere, “Sacrifice to God a sacrifice of praise, and render to
the Highest thy vows.” <span id="fr_1204"></span>[1205](#fn_1204) Thus,
accordingly, the spiritual “sacrifices of praise” are pointed to, and
“an heart contribulate” is demonstrated an acceptable sacrifice to God.
And thus, as carnal sacrifices are understood to be reprobated—of which
Isaiah withal speaks, saying, “To what end is the multitude of your
sacrifices to me? saith the Lord” <span
id="fr_1205"></span>[1206](#fn_1205) —so spiritual sacrifices are
predicted <span id="fr_1206"></span>[1207](#fn_1206) as accepted, as the
prophets announce.  For, “even if ye shall have brought me,” He says,
“the finest wheat flour, it is a vain supplicatory gift: a thing
execrable to me;” and again He says, “Your holocausts and sacrifices,
and the fat of goats, and blood of bulls, I will not, not even if ye
come to be seen by me: for who hath required these things from your
hands?” <span id="fr_1207"></span>[1208](#fn_1207) for “from the rising
sun unto the setting, my Name hath been made famous among all the
nations, <span id="page_157">p. 157</span> <span
id="iv.ix.v-Page_157"></span>saith the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1208"></span>[1209](#fn_1208) But of the spiritual sacrifices He
adds, saying, “And in every place they offer clean sacrifices to my
Name, saith the Lord.” <span id="fr_1209"></span>[1210](#fn_1209)
