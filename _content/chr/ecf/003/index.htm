<A HREF="0030142">The Heathen Perverted Judgment in the Trial of Christians. They Would Be More Consistent If They Dispensed with All Form of Trial. Tertullian Urges This with Much Indignation.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030143">The Great Offence in the Christians Lies in Their Very Name. The Name Vindicated.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030144">The Truth Hated in the Christians; So in Measure Was It, of Old, in Socrates. The Virtues of the Christians.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030145">The Inconsistent Life of Any False Christian No More Condemns True Disciples of Christ, Than a Passing Cloud Obscures a Summer Sky.</A><BR>

<A HREF="0030147">The Christians Defamed.&#160; A Sarcastic Description of Fame; Its Deception and Atrocious Slanders of the Christians Lengthily Described.</A><BR>

<A HREF="0030149">The Christians are Not the Cause of Public Calamities: There Were Such Troubles Before Christianity.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030150">The Christians are Not the Only Contemners of the Gods. Contempt of Them Often Displayed by Heathen Official Persons. Homer Made the Gods Contemptible.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030151">The Absurd Cavil of the Ass's Head Disposed of.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030152">The Charge of Worshipping a Cross. The Heathens Themselves Made Much of Crosses in Sacred Things; Nay, Their Very Idols Were Formed on a Crucial Frame.</A><BR>

<A HREF="0030171">A Disgraceful Feature of the Roman Mythology. It Honours Such Infamous Characters as Larentina.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030172">The Romans Provided Gods for Birth, Nay, Even Before Birth, to Death. Much Indelicacy in This System.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030173">The Original Deities Were Human--With Some Very Questionable Characteristics. Saturn or Time Was Human. Inconsistencies of Opinion About Him.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030174">The Gods Human at First.&#160; Who Had the Authority to Make Them Divine? Jupiter Not Only Human, But Immoral.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030175">Gods, Those Which Were Confessedly Elevated to the Divine Condition, What Pre-Eminent Right Had They to Such Honour? Hercules an Inferior Character.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030176">The Constellations and the Genii Very Indifferent Gods. The Roman Monopoly of Gods Unsatisfactory. Other Nations Require Deities Quite as Much.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030177">Inventors of Useful Arts Unworthy of Deification. They Would Be the First to Acknowledge a Creator. The Arts Changeable from Time to Time, and Some Become Obsolete.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030178">Conclusion, the Romans Owe Not Their Imperial Power to Their Gods. The Great God Alone Dispenses Kingdoms, He is the God of the Christians.</A><BR>

<A HREF="0030266">The Prescription Against Heretics.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030267">Chapter I</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030268">Analogy Between Fevers and Heresies. Heresies Not to Be Wondered At: Their Strength Derived from Weakness of Men's Faith. They Have Not the Truth. Simile of Pugilists and Gladiators in Illustration.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030269">Weak People Fall an Easy Prey to Heresy, Which Derives Strength from the General Frailty of Mankind.&#160; Eminent Men Have Fallen from Faith; Saul, David, Solomon. The Constancy of Christ.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030270">Warnings Against Heresy Given Us in the New Testament. Sundry Passages Adduced. These Imply the Possibility of Falling into Heresy.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030271">Heresy, as Well as Schism and Dissension, Disapproved by St. Paul, Who Speaks of the Necessity of Heresies, Not as a Good, But, by the Will of God, Salutary Trials for Training and Approving the Faith of Christians.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030272">Heretics are Self-Condemned. Heresy is Self-Will, Whilst Faith is Submission of Our Will to the Divine Authority.&#160; The Heresy of Apelles.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030273">Pagan Philosophy the Parent of Heresies. The Connection Between Deflections from Christian Faith and the Old Systems of Pagan Philosophy.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030274">Christ's Word, Seek, and Ye Shall Find, No Warrant for Heretical Deviations from the Faith. All Christ's Words to the Jews are for Us, Not Indeed as Specific Commands, But as Principles to Be Applied.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030275">The Research After Definite Truth Enjoined on Us. When We Have Discovered This, We Should Be Content.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030276">One Has Succeeded in Finding Definite Truth, When He Believes. Heretical Wits are Always Offering Many Things for Vain Discussion, But We are Not to Be Always Seeking.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030277">After We Have Believed, Search Should Cease; Otherwise It Must End in a Denial of What We Have Believed.&#160; No Other Object Proposed for Our Faith.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030278">A Proper Seeking After Divine Knowledge, Which Will Never Be Out of Place or Excessive, is Always Within the Rule of Faith.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030279">Summary of the Creed, or Rule of Faith. No Questions Ever Raised About It by Believers. Heretics Encourage and Perpetuate Thought Independent of Christ's Teaching.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030280">Curiosity Ought Not Range Beyond the Rule of Faith. Restless Curiosity, the Feature of Heresy.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030281">Heretics Not to Be Allowed to Argue Out of the Scriptures. The Scriptures, in Fact, Do Not Belong to Them.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030282">Apostolic Sanction to This Exclusion of Heretics from the Use of the Scriptures. Heretics, According to the Apostle, are Not to Be Disputed With, But to Be Admonished.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030283">Heretics, in Fact, Do Not Use, But Only Abuse, Scripture. No Common Ground Between Them and You.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030284">Great Evil Ensues to the Weak in Faith, from Any Discussion Out of the Scriptures. Conviction Never Comes to the Heretic from Such a Process.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030285">Appeal, in Discussion of Heresy, Lies Not to the Scriptures. The Scriptures Belong Only to Those Who Have the Rule of Faith.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030286">Christ First Delivered the Faith. The Apostles Spread It; They Founded Churches as the Depositories Thereof. That Faith, Therefore, is Apostolic, Which Descended from the Apostles, Through Apostolic Churches.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030287">All Doctrine True Which Comes Through the Church from the Apostles, Who Were Taught by God Through Christ. All Opinion Which Has No Such Divine Origin and Apostolic Tradition to Show, is Ipso Facto False.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030288">Attempt to Invalidate This Rule of Faith Rebutted. The Apostles Safe Transmitters of the Truth. Sufficiently Taught at First, and Faithful in the Transmission.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030289">The Apostles Not Ignorant. The Heretical Pretence of St. Peter's Imperfection Because He Was Rebuked by St. Paul. St. Peter Not Rebuked for Error in Teaching.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030290">St. Peter's Further Vindication. St. Paul Not Superior to St. Peter in Teaching. Nothing Imparted to the Former in the Third Heaven Enabled Him to Add to the Faith. Heretics Boast as If Favoured with Some of the Secrets Imparted to Him.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030291">The Apostles Did Not Keep Back Any of the Deposit of Doctrine Which Christ Had Entrusted to Them.&#160; St. Paul Openly Committed His Whole Doctrine to Timothy.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030292">The Apostles Did in All Cases Teach the Whole Truth to the Whole Church. No Reservation, Nor Partial Communication to Favourite Friends.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030293">Granted that the Apostles Transmitted the Whole Doctrine of Truth, May Not the Churches Have Been Unfaithful in Handing It On? Inconceivable that This Can Have Been the Case.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030294">The One Tradition of the Faith, Which is Substantially Alike in the Churches Everywhere, a Good Proof that the Transmission Has Been True and Honest in the Main.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030295">The Truth Not Indebted to the Care of the Heretics; It Had Free Course Before They Appeared.&#160; Priority of the Church's Doctrine a Mark of Its Truth.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030296">Comparative Lateness of Heresies. Marcion's Heresy. Some Personal Facts About Him. The Heresy of Apelles. Character of This Man; Philumene; Valentinus; Nigidius, and Hermogenes.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030297">Truth First, Falsehood Afterwards, as Its Perversion. Christ's Parable Puts the Sowing of the Good Seed Before the Useless Tares.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030298">None of the Heretics Claim Succession from the Apostles. New Churches Still Apostolic, Because Their Faith is that Which the Apostles Taught and Handed Down. The Heretics Challenged to Show Any Apostolic Credentials.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030299">Present Heresies (Seedlings of the Tares Noted by the Sacred Writers) Already Condemned in Scripture.&#160; This Descent of Later Heresy from the Earlier Traced in Several Instances.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030300">No Early Controversy Respecting the Divine Creator; No Second God Introduced at First. Heresies Condemned Alike by the Sentence and the Silence of Holy Scripture.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030301">Let Heretics Maintain Their Claims by a Definite and Intelligible Evidence. This the Only Method of Solving Their Questions.&#160; Catholics Appeal Always to Evidence Traceable to Apostolic Sources.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030302">The Apostolic Churches the Voice of the Apostles. Let the Heretics Examine Their Apostolic Claims, in Each Case, Indisputable. The Church of Rome Doubly Apostolic; Its Early Eminence and Excellence. Heresy, as Perverting the Truth, is Connected Therewith.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030303">Heretics Not Being Christians, But Rather Perverters of Christ's Teaching, May Not Claim the Christian Scriptures. These are a Deposit, Committed to and Carefully Kept by the Church.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030304">Harmony of the Church and the Scriptures. Heretics Have Tampered with the Scriptures, and Mutilated, and Altered Them.&#160; Catholics Never Change the Scriptures, Which Always Testify for Them.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030305">What St. Paul Calls Spiritual Wickednesses Displayed by Pagan Authors, and by Heretics, in No Dissimilar Manner. Holy Scripture Especially Liable to Heretical Manipulation. Affords Material for Heresies, Just as Virgil Has Been the Groundwork of Literary Plagiarisms, Different in Purport from the Original.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030306">No Difference in the Spirit of Idolatry and of Heresy. In the Rites of Idolatry, Satan Imitated and Distorted the Divine Institutions of the Older Scriptures. The Christian Scriptures Corrupted by Him in the Perversions of the Various Heretics.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030307">The Conduct of Heretics:&#160; Its Frivolity, Worldliness, and Irregularity. The Notorious Wantonness of Their Women.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030308">Heretics Work to Pull Down and to Destroy, Not to Edify and Elevate. Heretics Do Not Adhere Even to Their Own Traditions, But Harbour Dissent Even from Their Own Founders.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030309">Loose Company Preferred by Heretics. Ungodliness the Effect of Their Teaching the Very Opposite of Catholic Truth, Which Promotes the Fear of God, Both in Religious Ordinances and Practical Life.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030310">Heresy Lowers Respect for Christ, and Destroys All Fear of His Great Judgment. The Tendency of Heretical Teaching on This Solemn Article of the Faith. The Present Treatise an Introduction to Certain Other Anti-Heretical Works of Our Author.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030311">Elucidations.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030312">The Five Books Against Marcion.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030313">Introductory Notes.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030314">Book I</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030315">Chapter I</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030316">Marcion, Aided by Cerdon, Teaches a Duality of Gods; How He Constructed This Heresy of an Evil and a Good God.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030317">The Unity of God.&#160; He is the Supreme Being, and There Cannot Be a Second Supreme.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030318">Defence of the Divine Unity Against Objection. No Analogy Between Human Powers and God's Sovereignty. The Objection Otherwise Untenable, for Why Stop at Two Gods?</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030319">The Dual Principle Falls to the Ground; Plurality of Gods, of Whatever Number, More Consistent. Absurdity and Injury to Piety Resulting from Marcion's Duality.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030320">Marcion Untrue to His Theory. He Pretends that His Gods are Equal, But He Really Makes Them Diverse. Then, Allowing Their Divinity, Denies This Diversity.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030321">Other Beings Besides God are in Scripture Called God. This Objection Frivolous, for It is Not a Question of Names. The Divine Essence is the Thing at Issue. Heresy, in Its General Terms, Thus Far Treated.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030322">Specific Points.&#160; The Novelty of Marcion's God Fatal to His Pretensions. God is from Everlasting, He Cannot Be in Any Wise New.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030323">Marcion's Gnostic Pretensions Vain, for the True God is Neither Unknown Nor Uncertain. The Creator, Whom He Owns to Be God, Alone Supplies an Induction, by Which to Judge of the True God.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030324">The Creator Was Known as the True God from the First by His Creation. Acknowledged by the Soul and Conscience of Man Before He Was Revealed by Moses.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030325">The Evidence for God External to Him; But the External Creation Which Yields This Evidence is Really Not Extraneous, for All Things are God's. Marcion's God, Having Nothing to Show for Himself, No God at All. Marcion's Scheme Absurdly Defective, Not Furnishing Evidence for His New God's Existence, Which Should at Least Be Able to Compete with the Full Evidence of the Creator.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030326">Impossibility of Acknowledging God Without This External Evidence Of His Existence. Marcion's Rejection of Such Evidence for His God Savours of Impudence and Malignity.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030327">The Marcionites Depreciate the Creation, Which, However, is a Worthy Witness of God. This Worthiness Illustrated by References to the Heathen Philosophers, Who Were Apt to Invest the Several Parts of Creation with Divine Attributes.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030328">All Portions of Creation Attest the Excellence of the Creator, Whom Marcion Vilifies. His Inconsistency Herein Exposed. Marcion's Own God Did Not Hesitate to Use the Creator's Works in Instituting His Own Religion.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030329">The Lateness of the Revelation of Marcion's God. The Question of the Place Occupied by the Rival Deities. Instead of Two Gods, Marcion Really (Although, as It Would Seem, Unconsciously) Had Nine Gods in His System.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030330">Marcion Assumes the Existence of Two Gods from the Antithesis Between Things Visible and Things Invisible. This Antithetical Principle in Fact Characteristic of the Works of the Creator, the One God--Maker of All Things Visible and Invisible.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030331">Not Enough, as the Marcionites Pretend, that the Supreme God Should Rescue Man; He Must Also Have Created Him. The Existence of God Proved by His Creation, a Prior Consideration to His Character.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030332">Notwithstanding Their Conceits, the God of the Marcionites Fails in the Vouchers Both of Created Evidence and of Adequate Revelation.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030333">Jesus Christ, the Revealer of the Creator, Could Not Be the Same as Marcion's God, Who Was Only Made Known by the Heretic Some CXV. Years After Christ, and That, Too, on a Principle Utterly Unsuited to the Teaching of Jesus Christ, I.e., the Opposition Between the Law and the Gospels.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030334">Marcion, Justifying His Antithesis Between the Law and the Gospel by the Contention of St. Paul with St. Peter, Shown to Have Mistaken St. Paul's Position and Argument.&#160; Marcion's Doctrine Confuted Out of St. Paul's Teaching, Which Agrees Wholly with the Creator's Decrees.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030335">St. Paul Preached No New God, When He Announced the Repeal of Some of God's Ancient Ordinances.&#160; Never Any Hesitation About Belief in the Creator, as the God Whom Christ Revealed, Until Marcion's Heresy.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030336">God's Attribute of Goodness Considered as Natural; The God of Marcion Found Wanting Herein. It Came Not to Man's Rescue When First Wanted.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030337">God's Attribute of Goodness Considered as Rational. Marcion's God Defective Here Also; His Goodness Irrational and Misapplied.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030338">The Goodness of Marcion's God Only Imperfectly Manifested; It Saves But Few, and the Souls Merely of These. Marcion's Contempt of the Body Absurd.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030339">God is Not a Being of Simple Goodness; Other Attributes Belong to Him. Marcion Shows Inconsistency in the Portraiture of His Simply Good and Emotionless God.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030340">In the Attribute of Justice, Marcion's God is Hopelessly Weak and Ungodlike. He Dislikes Evil, But Does Not Punish Its Perpetration.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030341">Dangerous Effects to Religion and Morality of the Doctrine of So Weak a God.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030342">This Perverse Doctrine Deprives Baptism of All Its Grace. If Marcion Be Right, the Sacrament Would Confer No Remission of Sins, No Regeneration, No Gift of the Spirit.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030343">Marcion Forbids Marriage.&#160; Tertullian Eloquently Defends It as Holy, and Carefully Discriminates Between Marcion's Doctrine and His Own Montanism.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030344">Book II</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030345">Chapter I</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030346">The True Doctrine of God the Creator. The Heretics Pretended to a Knowledge of the Divine Being, Opposed to and Subversive of Revelation. God's Nature and Ways Past Human Discovery. Adam's Heresy.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030347">God Known by His Works.&#160; His Goodness Shown in His Creative Energy; But Everlasting in Its Nature; Inherent in God, Previous to All Exhibition of It. The First Stage of This Goodness Prior to Man.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030348">The Next Stage Occurs in the Creation of Man by the Eternal Word. Spiritual as Well as Physical Gifts to Man. The Blessings of Man's Free-Will.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030349">Marcion's Cavils Considered. His Objection Refuted, I.e., Man's Fall Showed Failure in God. The Perfection of Man's Being Lay in His Liberty, Which God Purposely Bestowed on Him. The Fall Imputable to Man's Own Choice.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030350">This Liberty Vindicated in Respect of Its Original Creation; Suitable Also for Exhibiting the Goodness and the Purpose of God. Reward and Punishment Impossible If Man Were Good or Evil Through Necessity and Not Choice.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030351">If God Had Anyhow Checked Man's Liberty, Marcion Would Have Been Ready with Another and Opposite Cavil. Man's Fall Foreseen by God. Provision Made for It Remedially and Consistently with His Truth and Goodness.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030352">Man, Endued with Liberty, Superior to the Angels, Overcomes Even the Angel Which Lured Him to His Fall, When Repentant and Resuming Obedience to God.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030353">Another Cavil Answered, I.e., the Fall Imputable to God, Because Man's Soul is a Portion of the Spiritual Essence of the Creator. The Divine Afflatus Not in Fault in the Sin of Man, But the Human Will Which Was Additional to It.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030354">Another Cavil Met, I.e., the Devil Who Instigated Man to Sin Himself the Creature of God. Nay, the Primeval Cherub Only Was God's Work.&#160; The Devilish Nature Superadded by Wilfulness. In Man's Recovery the Devil is Vanquished in a Conflict on His Own Ground.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030355">If, After Man's Sin, God Exercised His Attribute of Justice and Judgment, This Was Compatible with His Goodness, and Enhances the True Idea of the Perfection of God's Character.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030356">The Attributes of Goodness and Justice Should Not Be Separated. They are Compatible in the True God. The Function of Justice in the Divine Being Described.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030357">Further Description of the Divine Justice; Since the Fall of Man It Has Regulated the Divine Goodness.&#160; God's Claims on Our Love and Our Fear Reconciled.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030358">Evil of Two Kinds, Penal and Criminal. It is Not of the Latter Sort that God is the Author, But Only of the Former, Which are Penal, and Included in His Justice.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030359">The Severity of God Compatible with Reason and Justice. When Inflicted, Not Meant to Be Arbitrary, But Remedial.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030360">To the Severity of God There Belong Accessory Qualities, Compatible with Justice. If Human Passions are Predicated of God, They Must Not Be Measured on the Scale of Human Imperfection.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030361">Trace God's Government in History and in His Precepts, and You Will Find It Full of His Goodness.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030362">Some of God's Laws Defended as Good, Which the Marcionites Impeached, Such as the Lex Talionis. Useful Purposes in a Social and Moral Point of View of This, and Sundry Other Enactments.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030363">The Minute Prescriptions of the Law Meant to Keep the People Dependent on God. The Prophets Sent by God in Pursuance of His Goodness.&#160; Many Beautiful Passages from Them Quoted in Illustration of This Attribute.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030364">The Marcionites Charged God with Having Instigated the Hebrews to Spoil the Egyptians. Defence of the Divine Dispensation in that Matter.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030365">The Law of the Sabbath-Day Explained. The Eight Days' Procession Around Jericho. The Gathering of Sticks a Violation.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030366">The Brazen Serpent and the Golden Cherubim Were Not Violations of the Second Commandment.&#160; Their Meaning.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030367">God's Purposes in Election and Rejection of the Same Men, Such as King Saul, Explained, in Answer to the Marcionite Cavil.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030368">Instances of God's Repentance, and Notably in the Case of the Ninevites, Accounted for and Vindicated.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030369">God's Dealings with Adam at the Fall, and with Cain After His Crime, Admirably Explained and Defended.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030370">The Oath of God:&#160; Its Meaning. Moses, When Deprecating God's Wrath Against Israel, a Type of Christ.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030371">Other Objections Considered. God's Condescension in the Incarnation. Nothing Derogatory to the Divine Being in This Economy. The Divine Majesty Worthily Sustained by the Almighty Father, Never Visible to Man. Perverseness of the Marcionite Cavils.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030372">The Tables Turned Upon Marcion, by Contrasts, in Favour of the True God.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030373">Marcion's Own Antitheses, If Only the Title and Object of the Work Be Excepted, Afford Proofs of the Consistent Attributes of the True God.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030374">Book III</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030375">Chapter I</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030376">Why Christ's Coming Should Be Previously Announced.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030377">Miracles Alone, Without Prophecy, an Insufficient Evidence of Christ's Mission.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030378">Marcion's Christ Not the Subject of Prophecy. The Absurd Consequences of This Theory of the Heretic.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030379">Sundry Features of the Prophetic Style: Principles of Its Interpretation.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030380">Community in Certain Points of Marcionite and Jewish Error. Prophecies of Christ's Rejection Examined.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030381">Prophecy Sets Forth Two Different Conditions of Christ, One Lowly, the Other Majestic. This Fact Points to Two Advents of Christ.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030382">Absurdity of Marcion's Docetic Opinions; Reality of Christ's Incarnation.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030383">Refutation of Marcion's Objections Derived from the Cases of the Angels, and the Pre-Incarnate Manifestations of the Son of God.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030384">The Truly Incarnate State More Worthy of God Than Marcion's Fantastic Flesh.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030385">Christ Was Truly Born; Marcion's Absurd Cavil in Defence of a Putative Nativity.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030386">Isaiah's Prophecy of Emmanuel. Christ Entitled to that Name.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030387">Isaiah's Prophecies Considered. The Virginity of Christ's Mother a Sign. Other Prophecies Also Signs. Metaphorical Sense of Proper Names in Sundry Passages of the Prophets.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030388">Figurative Style of Certain Messianic Prophecies in the Psalms. Military Metaphors Applied to Christ.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030389">The Title Christ Suitable as a Name of the Creator's Son, But Unsuited to Marcion's Christ.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030390">The Sacred Name Jesus Most Suited to the Christ of the Creator. Joshua a Type of Him.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030391">Prophecies in Isaiah and the Psalms Respecting Christ's Humiliation.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030392">Types of the Death of Christ. Isaac; Joseph; Jacob Against Simeon and Levi; Moses Praying Against Amalek; The Brazen Serpent.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030393">Prophecies of the Death of Christ.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030394">The Subsequent Influence of Christ's Death in the World Predicted. The Sure Mercies of David. What These are.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030395">The Call of the Gentiles Under the Influence of the Gospel Foretold.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030396">The Success of the Apostles, and Their Sufferings in the Cause of the Gospel, Foretold.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030397">The Dispersion of the Jews, and Their Desolate Condition for Rejecting Christ, Foretold.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030398">Christ's Millennial and Heavenly Glory in Company with His Saints.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030399">Book IV</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030400">Chapter I</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030401">St. Luke's Gospel, Selected by Marcion as His Authority, and Mutilated by Him. The Other Gospels Equally Authoritative. Marcion's Terms of Discussion, However, Accepted, and Grappled with on the Footing of St. Luke's Gospel Alone.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030402">Marcion Insinuated the Untrustworthiness of Certain Apostles Whom St. Paul Rebuked. The Rebuke Shows that It Cannot Be Regarded as Derogating from Their Authority. The Apostolic Gospels Perfectly Authentic.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030403">Each Side Claims to Possess the True Gospel. Antiquity the Criterion of Truth in Such a Matter. Marcion's Pretensions as an Amender of the Gospel.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030404">By the Rule of Antiquity, the Catholic Gospels are Found to Be True, Including the Real St. Luke's. Marcion's Only a Mutilated Edition. The Heretic's Weakness and Inconsistency in Ignoring the Other Gospels.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030405">Marcion's Object in Adulterating the Gospel. No Difference Between the Christ of the Creator and the Christ of the Gospel. No Rival Christ Admissible. The Connection of the True Christ with the Dispensation of the Old Testament Asserted.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030406">Marcion Rejected the Preceding Portion of St. Luke's Gospel. Therefore This Review Opens with an Examination of the Case of the Evil Spirit in the Synagogue of Capernaum. He Whom the Demon Acknowledged Was the Creator's Christ.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030407">Other Proofs from the Same Chapter, that Jesus, Who Preached at Nazareth, and Was Acknowledged by Certain Demons as Christ the Son of God, Was the Creator's Christ. As Occasion Offers, the Docetic Errors of Marcion are Exposed.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030408">Out of St. Luke's Fifth Chapter are Found Proofs of Christ's Belonging to the Creator, E.g. In the Call of Fishermen to the Apostolic Office, and in the Cleansing of the Leper. Christ Compared with the Prophet Elisha.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030409">Further Proofs of the Same Truth in the Same Chapter, from the Healing of the Paralytic, and from the Designation Son of Man Which Jesus Gives Himself. Tertullian Sustains His Argument by Several Quotations from the Prophets.</A><BR>
<A HREF="0030410">The Call of Levi the Publican. Christ in Relation to the Baptist. Christ as the Bridegroom. The Parable of the Old Wine and the New. Arguments Connecting Christ with the Creator.</A><BR>

<A HREF="0030461">The First Epistle to the Thessalonians. The Shorter Epistles Pungent in Sense and Very Valuable. St. Paul Upbraids the Jews for the Death First of Their Prophets and Then of Christ.
