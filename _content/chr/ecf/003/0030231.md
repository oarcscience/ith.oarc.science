<span id="iv.xi.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—Soul and Body Conceived,
Formed and Perfected in Element Simultaneously.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.xxvii-p2"></span>How, then, is a living being conceived?
Is the substance of both body and soul formed together at one and the
same time? Or does one of them precede the other in natural formation?
We indeed maintain that both are conceived, and formed, and perfectly
simultaneously, as well as born together; and that not a moment’s
interval occurs in their conception, so that, a prior place can be
assigned to either. <span id="fr_1693"></span>[1694](#fn_1693) Judge, in
fact, of the incidents of man’s earliest existence by those which occur
to him at the very last. As death is defined to be nothing else than the
separation of body and soul, <span id="fr_1694"></span>[1695](#fn_1694)
life, which is the opposite of death, is susceptible of no other
definition than the conjunction of body and soul.  If the severance
happens at one and the same time to both substances by means of death,
so the law of their combination ought to assure us that it occurs
simultaneously to the two substances by means of life. Now we allow that
life begins with conception, because we contend that the soul also
begins from conception; life taking its commencement at the same moment
and place that the soul does. Thus, then, the processes which act
together to produce separation by death, also combine in a simultaneous
action to produce <span id="page_208">p. 208</span> <span
id="iv.xi.xxvii-Page_208"></span>life. If we assign priority to (the
formation of) one of the natures, and a subsequent time to the other, we
shall have further to determine the precise times of the semination,
according to the condition and rank of each. And that being so, what
time shall we give to the seed of the body, and what to the seed of the
soul? Besides, if different periods are to be assigned to the
seminations then arising out of this difference in time, we shall also
have different substances. <span id="fr_1695"></span>[1696](#fn_1695)
For although we shall allow that there are two kinds of seed—that of the
body and that of the soul—we still declare that they are inseparable,
and therefore contemporaneous and simultaneous in origin. Now let no one
take offence or feel ashamed at an interpretation of the processes of
nature which is rendered necessary (by the defence of the truth). Nature
should be to us an object of reverence, not of blushes. It is lust, not
natural usage, which has brought shame on the intercourse of the sexes. 
It is the excess, not the normal state, which is immodest and unchaste:
the normal condition has received a blessing from God, and is blest by
Him: “Be fruitful, and multiply, (and replenish the earth.)” <span
id="fr_1696"></span>[1697](#fn_1696) Excess, however, has He cursed, in
adulteries, and wantonness, and chambering. <span
id="fr_1697"></span>[1698](#fn_1697) Well, now, in this usual function
of the sexes which brings together the male and the female in their
common intercourse, we know that both the soul and the flesh discharge a
duty together: the soul supplies desire, the flesh contributes the
gratification of it; the soul furnishes the instigation, the flesh
affords the realization. The entire man being excited by the one effort
of both natures, his seminal substance is discharged, deriving its
fluidity from the body, and its warmth from the soul. Now if *the soul*
in Greek is a word which is synonymous with *cold*, <span
id="fr_1698"></span>[1699](#fn_1698) how does it come to pass that the
body grows cold after the soul has quitted it? Indeed (if I run the risk
of offending modesty even, in my desire to prove the truth), I cannot
help asking, whether we do not, in that very heat of extreme
gratification when the generative fluid is ejected, feel that somewhat
of our soul has gone from us? And do we not experience a faintness and
prostration along with a dimness of sight?  This, then, must be the
soul-producing seed, which arises at once from the out-drip of the soul,
just as that fluid is the body-producing seed which proceeds from the
drainage of the flesh.  Most true are the examples of the first
creation. Adam’s flesh was formed of clay. Now what is clay but an
excellent moisture, whence should spring the generating fluid?  From the
breath of God first came the soul. But what else is the breath of God
than the vapour of the spirit, whence should spring that which we
breathe out through the generative fluid? Forasmuch, therefore, as these
two different and separate substances, the clay and the breath, combined
at the first creation in forming the individual man, they then both
amalgamated and mixed their proper seminal rudiments in one, and ever
afterwards communicated to the human race the normal mode of its
propagation, so that even now the two substances, although diverse from
each other, flow forth simultaneously in a united channel; and finding
their way together into their appointed seed-plot, they fertilize with
their combined vigour the human fruit out of their respective natures. 
And inherent in this human product is his own seed, according to the
process which has been ordained for every creature endowed with the
functions of generation. Accordingly from the one (primeval) man comes
the entire outflow and redundance of men’s souls—nature proving herself
true to the commandment of God, “Be fruitful, and multiply.” <span
id="fr_1699"></span>[1700](#fn_1699) For in the very preamble of this
one production, “Let us make man,” <span
id="fr_1700"></span>[1701](#fn_1700) man’s whole posterity was declared
and described in a plural phrase, “Let *them* have dominion over the
fish of the sea,” etc. <span id="fr_1701"></span>[1702](#fn_1701) And no
wonder: in the seed lies the promise and earnest of the crop.
