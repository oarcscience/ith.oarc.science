<span id="v.iv.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—God Known by His Works. His
Goodness Shown in His Creative Energy; But Everlasting in Its Nature;
Inherent in God, Previous to All Exhibition of It.  The First Stage of
This Goodness Prior to Man.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii.iii-p2"></span>It will therefore be right for us, as
we enter on the examination of the known God, when <span
id="page_299">p. 299</span> <span id="v.iv.iii.iii-Page_299"></span>the
question arises, in what condition He is known to us, to begin with His
works, which are prior to man; so that His goodness, being discovered
immediately along with Himself, and then constituted and prescriptively
settled, may suggest to us some sense whereby we may understand how the
subsequent order of things came about. The disciples of Marcion,
moreover, may possibly be able, while recognising the goodness of our
God, to learn how worthy it is likewise of the Divine Being, on those
very grounds whereby we have proved it to be unworthy in the case of
their god. Now this very point, <span
id="fr_2724"></span>[2725](#fn_2724) which is a material one in their
scheme, <span id="fr_2725"></span>[2726](#fn_2725) *Marcion* did not
find in any other god, but eliminated it for himself out of his own god.
The first goodness, then, <span id="fr_2726"></span>[2727](#fn_2726) was
that of the Creator, whereby God was unwilling to remain hidden for
ever; in other words, (unwilling) that there should not be a something
by which God should become known. For what, indeed, is so good as the
knowledge and fruition <span id="fr_2727"></span>[2728](#fn_2727) of
God? Now, although it did not transpires that this was good, because as
yet there existed nothing to which it could transpire, <span
id="fr_2728"></span>[2729](#fn_2728) yet God foreknew what good would
eventually transpire, and therefore He set Himself about
developing <span id="fr_2729"></span>[2730](#fn_2729) His own perfect
goodness, for the accomplishment of the good which was to transpire;
not, indeed, a sudden goodness issuing in some accidental boon <span
id="fr_2730"></span>[2731](#fn_2730) or in some excited impulse, <span
id="fr_2731"></span>[2732](#fn_2731) such as must be dated simply from
the moment when it began to operate. For if it did itself produce its
own beginning when it began to operate, it had not, in fact, a beginning
itself when it acted. When, however, an initial act had been once done
by it, the scheme of temporal seasons began, for distinguishing and
noting which, the stars and luminaries of heaven were arranged in their
order. “Let them be,” says God, “for seasons, and for days, and
years.” <span id="fr_2732"></span>[2733](#fn_2732) Previous, then, to
this temporal course, (the goodness) which created time had not time;
nor before that beginning which the same goodness originated, had it a
beginning.  Being therefore without all order of a beginning, and all
mode of time, it will be reckoned to possess an age, measureless in
extent <span id="fr_2733"></span>[2734](#fn_2733) and endless in
duration; <span id="fr_2734"></span>[2735](#fn_2734) nor will it be
possible to regard it as a sudden or adventitious or impulsive emotion,
because it has nothing to occasion such an estimate of itself; in other
words, no sort of temporal sequence.  It must therefore be accounted an
eternal attribute, inbred in God, <span
id="fr_2735"></span>[2736](#fn_2735) and everlasting, <span
id="fr_2736"></span>[2737](#fn_2736) and on this account worthy of the
Divine Being, putting to shame for ever <span
id="fr_2737"></span>[2738](#fn_2737) the benevolence of Marcion’s god,
subsequent as he is to (I will not say) all beginnings and times, but to
the very malignity of the Creator, if indeed malignity could possibly
have been found in goodness.
