<span id="iv.viii.i.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI. <span
id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530) —The Innocence of the Christians Not
Compromised by the Iniquitous Laws Which Were Made Against Them.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.vi-p3"></span>Whenever these statements and answers
of ours, which truth suggests of its own accord, press and restrain your
conscience, which is the witness of its own ignorance, you betake
yourselves in hot haste to that poor altar of refuge, <span
id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531) the authority of the laws, because
these, of course, would never punish the offensive <span
id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532) sect, if their deserts had not been
fully considered by those who made the laws. Then what is it which has
prevented a like consideration on the part of those who put the laws in
force, when, in the case of all other crimes which are similarly
forbidden and punished by the laws, the penalty is not inflicted <span
id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533) until it is sought by regular
process? <span id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534) Take, <span
id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535) for instance, the case of a murderer
or an adulterer. An examination is ordered touching the
particulars <span id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536) of the crime, even
though it is patent to all what its nature <span
id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537) is. Whatever wrong has been done by
the Christian ought to be brought to light.  No law forbids inquiry to
be made; on the contrary, inquiry is made in the interest of the
laws. <span id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538) For how are you to keep
the law by precautions against that which the law forbids, if you
neutralize the carefulness of the precaution by your failing to
perceive <span id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539) what it is you have to
keep? No law must keep to itself <span id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540)
the knowledge of its own righteousness, <span
id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541) but (it owes it) to those from whom it
claims obedience. The law, however, becomes an object of suspicion when
it declines to approve itself.  Naturally enough, <span
id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542) then, are the laws against <span
id="page_114">p. 114</span> <span id="iv.viii.i.vi-Page_114"></span>the
Christians supposed to be just and deserving of respect and observance,
just as long as men remain ignorant of their aim and purport; but when
this is perceived, their extreme injustice is discovered, and they are
deservedly rejected with abhorrence, <span
id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543) along with (their instruments of
torture)—the swords, the crosses, and the lions. An unjust law secures
no respect. In my opinion, however, there is a suspicion among you that
some of these laws are unjust, since not a day passes without your
modifying their severity and iniquity by fresh deliberations and
decisions.
