<span id="iv.v.xxvi-p2"></span>Why may not those who go into the
temptations of the show become accessible also to evil spirits? We have
the case of the woman—the Lord Himself is witness—who went to the
theatre, and came back possessed. In the outcasting, <span
id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368) accordingly, when the unclean creature
was upbraided with having dared to attack a believer, he firmly
replied, <span id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369) “And in truth I did it
most righteously, for I found her in my domain.” Another case, too, is
well known, in which a woman had been hearing a tragedian, and on the
very night she saw in her sleep a linen cloth—the actor’s name being
mentioned at the same time with strong disapproval—and five days after
that woman was no more. How many other undoubted proofs we have had in
the case of persons who, by keeping company with the devil in the shows,
have fallen from the Lord! For no one can serve two masters. <span
id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370) What fellowship has light with
darkness, life with death? <span id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371)
