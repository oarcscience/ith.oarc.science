<span id="iv.viii.i.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI. <span
id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650) —The Absurd Cavil of the Ass’s Head
Disposed of.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xi-p3"></span>In this matter we are (said to be)
guilty not merely of forsaking the religion of the community, but of
introducing a monstrous superstition; for some among you have dreamed
that our god is an ass’s head,—an absurdity which Cornelius Tacitus
first suggested. In the fourth book of his *histories*, <span
id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651) where he is treating of the Jewish
war, he begins his description with the origin of that nation, and gives
his own views respecting both the origin and the name of their religion.
He relates that the Jews, in their migration in the desert, when
suffering for want of water, escaped by following for guides some wild
asses, which they supposed to be going in quest of water after pasture,
and that on this account the image of one of these animals was
worshipped by the Jews. From this, I suppose, it was presumed that we,
too, from our close connection with the Jewish religion, have ours
consecrated under the same emblematic form. The same Cornelius Tacitus,
however,—who, to say the truth, is most loquacious in
falsehood—forgetting his later statement, relates how Pompey the Great,
after conquering the Jews and capturing Jerusalem, entered the temple,
but found nothing in the shape of an image, though he examined the place
carefully. Where, then, should their God have been found? Nowhere else,
of course, than in so memorable a temple which was carefully shut to all
but the priests, and into which there could be no fear of a stranger
entering. But what apology must I here offer for what I am going to say,
when I have no other object at the moment than to make a passing remark
or two in a general way which shall be equally applicable to
yourselves? <span id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652) Suppose that our
God, then, be an asinine person, will you at all events deny that you
possess the same characteristics with ourselves in that matter? (Not
their heads only, but) entire asses, are, to be sure, objects of
adoration to you, along with their tutelar Epona; and all herds, and
cattle, and beasts you consecrate, and their stables into the bargain! 
This, perhaps, is your grievance against us, that, when surrounded by
cattle-worshippers of every kind we are simply devoted to asses!

<span id="iv.viii.i.xi-p4"></span> In *The Apology* (c. xvi.) the
reference is to “the fifth book.” This is correct. Book v. c. 3, is
meant.
