<span id="v.ix.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.ix.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—On St. Philip’s Conversation
with Christ. He that Hath Seen Me, Hath Seen the Father. This Text
Explained in an Anti-Praxean Sense.</span>

<span id="v.ix.xxiv-p2"></span>But there were some who even then did not
understand. For Thomas, who was so long incredulous, said: “Lord, we
know not whither Thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus saith
unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the
Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye would have known the Father
also:  but henceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him.” <span
id="fr_8091"></span>[8092](#fn_8091) And now we come to Philip, who,
roused with the expectation of seeing the Father, and not understanding
in what sense he was to take “seeing the Father,” says:  “Show us the
Father, and it sufficeth us.” <span id="fr_8092"></span>[8093](#fn_8092)
Then the Lord answered him: “Have I been so long time with you, and yet
hast thou not known me, Philip?” <span
id="fr_8093"></span>[8094](#fn_8093) Now whom does He say that they
ought to have known?—for this is the sole point of discussion. Was it as
the Father that they ought to have known Him, or as the Son? If it was
as the Father, Praxeas must tell us how Christ, who had been so long
time with them, could have possibly ever been (I will not say
understood, but even) supposed to have been the Father. He is clearly
defined to us in all Scriptures—in the Old Testament as the Christ of
God, in the New Testament as the Son of God.  In this character was He
anciently predicted, in this was He also declared even by Christ
Himself; nay, by the very Father also, who openly confesses Him from
heaven as His Son, and as His Son glorifies Him. “This is my beloved
Son;” “I have glorified Him, and I will glorify Him.” In this character,
too, was He believed on by His disciples, and rejected by the Jews. It
was, moreover, in this character that He wished to be accepted by them
whenever He named the Father, and gave preference to the Father, and
honoured the Father. This, then, being the case, it was not the Father
whom, after His lengthened intercourse with them, they were ignorant of,
but it was the Son; and accordingly the Lord, while upbraiding *Philip*
for not knowing Himself who was the object of their ignorance, wished
Himself to be acknowledged indeed as that *Being* whom He had reproached
them for being ignorant of after so long a time—in a word, as the Son.
And now it may be seen in what sense it was said, “He that hath seen me
hath seen the Father,” <span id="fr_8094"></span>[8095](#fn_8094) —even
in the same in which it was said in a previous passage, “I and my Father
are one.” <span id="fr_8095"></span>[8096](#fn_8095) Wherefore?  Because
“I came forth from the Father, and am come *into the world*” <span
id="fr_8096"></span>[8097](#fn_8096) and, “I am the way: no man cometh
unto the Father, but by me;” <span id="fr_8097"></span>[8098](#fn_8097)
and, “No man can come to me, except the Father draw him;” <span
id="fr_8098"></span>[8099](#fn_8098) and, “All things are delivered unto
me by the Father;” <span id="fr_8099"></span>[8100](#fn_8099) and, “As
the Father quickeneth (the dead), so also doth the Son;” <span
id="fr_8100"></span>[8101](#fn_8100) and again, “If ye had known me, ye
would have known the Father also.” <span
id="fr_8101"></span>[8102](#fn_8101) For in all these passages He had
shown Himself to be the Father’s Commissioner, <span
id="fr_8102"></span>[8103](#fn_8102) through whose agency even the
Father could be seen in His works, and heard in His words, and
recognised in the Son’s administration of the Father’s words and deeds.
The Father indeed was invisible, as Philip had learnt in the law, and
ought at the moment to have remembered: “No man shall see God, and
live.” <span id="fr_8103"></span>[8104](#fn_8103) So he is reproved for
desiring to see the Father, as if He were a visible Being, and is taught
that He only becomes visible in the Son from His mighty works, and not
in the manifestation of His person. If, indeed, He meant the Father to
be understood as the same with the Son, by saying, “He who seeth me
seeth the Father,” how is it that He adds immediately afterwards,
“Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in
me?” <span id="fr_8104"></span>[8105](#fn_8104) He ought rather to have
said: “Believest thou not that I am the Father?” With what view else did
He so emphatically dwell on this point, if it were not to clear up that
which He wished men to understand—namely, that He was the Son? And then,
again, by saying, “Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the
Father in me,” <span id="fr_8105"></span>[8106](#fn_8105) He laid the
greater stress on His question on this very account, that He should not,
because He had said, “He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father,” be
supposed to be the Father; because He had never wished Himself to be so
regarded, having always professed Himself to be the Son, and to have
come from the Father. And then He also set the conjunction of the two
Persons in the clearest light, in order that no wish might be
entertained of seeing the Father as if He were separately visible, and
<span id="page_621">p. 621</span> <span
id="v.ix.xxiv-Page_621"></span>that the Son might be regarded as the
representative of the Father. And yet He omitted not to explain how the
Father was in the Son and the Son in the Father. “The words,” says He,
“which I speak unto you, are not mine,” <span
id="fr_8106"></span>[8107](#fn_8106) because indeed they were the
Father’s words; “but the Father that dwelleth in me, He doeth the
works.” <span id="fr_8107"></span>[8108](#fn_8107) It is therefore by
His mighty works, and by the words of His doctrine, that the Father who
dwells in the Son makes Himself visible—even by those *words and works*
whereby He abides in Him, and also by Him in whom He abides; the special
properties of Both the Persons being apparent from this very
circumstance, that He says, “I am in the Father, and the Father is in
me.” <span id="fr_8108"></span>[8109](#fn_8108) Accordingly He adds:
“Believe—”  What? That I am the Father? I do not find that it is so
written, but rather, “that I am *in* the Father, and the Father in me;
or else believe me for my works’ sake;” <span
id="fr_8109"></span>[8110](#fn_8109) meaning those works by which the
Father manifested Himself to be in the Son, not indeed to the sight of
man, but to his intelligence.
