<span id="iv.xi.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.xi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—The Soul’s Origin Defined Out of
the Simple Words of Scripture.</span>

<span id="iv.xi.iii-p2"></span>Would to God that no “heresies had been
ever necessary, in order that they which are approved may be made
manifest!” <span id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506) We should then be
never required to try our strength in contests about the soul with
philosophers, those patriarchs of heretics, as they may be fairly
called. <span id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507) The apostle, so far
back as his own time, foresaw, indeed, that philosophy would do violent
injury to the truth. <span id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508) This
admonition *about false philosophy* he was induced to offer after he had
been at Athens, had become acquainted with that *loquacious* city, <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509) and had there had a taste of its
huckstering wiseacres and talkers. In like manner is the treatment of
the soul according to the sophistical doctrines of men which “mix their
<span id="page_184">p. 184</span> <span
id="iv.xi.iii-Page_184"></span>wine with water.” <span
id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510) Some of them deny the immortality
of the soul; others affirm that it is immortal, and something more. Some
raise disputes about its substance; others about its form; others,
again, respecting each of its several faculties. One school of
philosophers derives its state from various sources, while another
ascribes its departure to different destinations. *The various schools
reflect the character of their masters*, according as they have received
their impressions from the dignity <span
id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511) of Plato, or the vigour <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512) of Zeno, or the equanimity <span
id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513) of Aristotle, or the
stupidity <span id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514) of Epicurus, or the
sadness <span id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515) of Heraclitus, or the
madness <span id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516) of Empedocles. The
fault, I suppose, of the divine doctrine lies in its springing from
Judæa <span id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517) rather than from
Greece. Christ made a mistake, too, in sending forth fishermen to
preach, rather than the sophist. Whatever noxious vapours, accordingly,
exhaled from philosophy, obscure the clear and wholesome atmosphere of
truth, it will be for Christians to clear away, both by shattering to
pieces the arguments which are drawn from the principles of things—I
mean those of the philosophers—and by opposing to them the maxims of
heavenly wisdom—that is, such as are revealed by the Lord; in order that
both the pitfalls wherewith philosophy captivates the heathen may be
removed, and the means employed by heresy to shake the faith of
Christians may be repressed. We have already decided one point in our
controversy with Hermogenes, as we said at the beginning of this
treatise, when we claimed the soul to be formed by the breathing <span
id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518) of God, and not out of matter. We
relied even there on the clear direction of the inspired statement which
informs us how that “the Lord God breathed on man’s face the breath of
life, so that man became a living soul” <span
id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519) —by that inspiration of God, of
course. On this point, therefore, nothing further need be investigated
or advanced by us. It has its own treatise, <span
id="fr_1520"></span>[1521](#fn_1520) and its own heretic. I shall regard
it as my introduction to the other branches of the subject.
