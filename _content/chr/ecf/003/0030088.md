<span id="iv.v.iv-p2"></span>Lest any one think that we are dealing in
mere argumentative subtleties, I shall turn to that highest authority of
our “seal” itself. When entering the water, we make profession of the
Christian faith in the words of its rule; we bear public testimony that
we have renounced the devil, his pomp, and his angels. Well, is it not
in connection with idolatry, above all, that you have the devil with his
pomp and his angels? from which, to speak briefly—for I do not wish to
dilate—you have every unclean and wicked spirit. If, therefore, it shall
be made plain that the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon
idolatry, beyond all doubt that will carry with it the conclusion that
our renunciatory testimony in the laver of baptism has reference to the
shows, which, through their idolatry, have been given over to the devil,
and his pomp, and his angels. We shall set forth, then, their several
origins, in what nursing-places they have grown to manhood; next the
titles of some of them, by what names they are called; then their
apparatus, with what superstitions they are observed; (then their
places, to what patrons they are dedicated;) then the arts which
minister to them, to what authors they are traced. If any of these shall
be found to have had no connection with an idol-god, it will be held as
free at once from the taint of idolatry, and as not coming within the
range of our baptismal abjuration. <span

referring to Scripture and not at all to the “new Prophecy,” our author
shows his orthodoxy. We may add “ that *highest* authority” to which he
appeals in this chapter.\]
