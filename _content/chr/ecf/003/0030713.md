<span id="vi.ii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Sin Never to Be Returned to After
Repentance. <span id="fr_8456"></span>[8457](#fn_8456) </span>

<span id="vi.ii.v-p3"></span>For what I say is this, that the repentance
which, being shown us and commanded us through God’s grace, recalls us
to grace <span id="fr_8457"></span>[8458](#fn_8457) with the Lord, when
once learned and undertaken by us ought never afterward to be cancelled
by repetition of sin. No pretext of ignorance now remains to plead on
your behalf; in that, after acknowledging the Lord, and accepting His
precepts <span id="fr_8458"></span>[8459](#fn_8458) —in short, after
engaging in repentance of (past) sins—you again betake yourself to sins.
Thus, in as far as you are removed from ignorance, in so far are you
cemented <span id="fr_8459"></span>[8460](#fn_8459) to contumacy. For if
the ground on which you had repented of having sinned was that you had
begun to fear the Lord, why have you preferred to rescind what you did
for fear’s sake, except because you have ceased to fear? For there is no
other thing but contumacy which subverts fear.  Since there is no
exception which defends from liability to penalty even such as are
ignorant of the Lord—because ignorance of God, openly as He is set
before men, and comprehensible as He is even on the score of His
heavenly benefits, is not possible <span
id="fr_8460"></span>[8461](#fn_8460) —how perilous is it for Him to be
despised when known? Now, that man does despise Him, who, after
attaining by His help to an understanding of things good and evil, often
an affront to his own understanding—that is, to God’s gift—by resuming
what he understands ought to be shunned, and what he has already
shunned: he rejects the Giver in abandoning the gift; he denies the
Benefactor in not honouring the benefit. How can he be pleasing to Him,
whose gift is displeasing to himself? Thus he is shown to be not only
contumacious toward the Lord, but likewise ungrateful. Besides, that man
commits no light sin against the Lord, who, after he had by repentance
renounced His rival the devil, and had under this appellation subjected
him to the Lord, again upraises him by his own return (to the enemy),
and makes himself a ground of exultation to him; so that the Evil One,
with his prey recovered, rejoices anew against the Lord. Does he
not—what is perilous even to say, but must be put forward with a view to
edification—place the devil before the Lord? For he seems to have made
the comparison who has known each; and to have judicially pronounced him
to be the better whose (servant) he has preferred again to be. Thus he
who, through repentance for sins, had begun to make satisfaction to the
Lord, will, through another repentance of his repentance, make
satisfaction to the devil, and will be the more hateful to God in
proportion as he will be the more acceptable to His rival. But some say
that “God is satisfied if He be looked up to with the heart and the
mind, even if this be not done in *outward* act, and that thus they sin
without damage to their fear and their faith:”  that is, that they
violate wedlock without damage to their chastity; they mingle poison for
their parent without damage to their filial duty! Thus, then, they will
themselves withal be thrust down into hell without damage to their
pardon, while they sin without damage to their fear! Here is a primary
example of perversity: they sin, because they fear! <span
id="fr_8461"></span>[8462](#fn_8461) I suppose, if they feared <span
id="page_661">p. 661</span> <span id="vi.ii.v-Page_661"></span>not, they
would not sin! Let him, therefore, who would not have God offended not
revere Him at all, if fear <span id="fr_8462"></span>[8463](#fn_8462) is
the plea for offending. But these dispositions have been wont to sprout
from the seed of hypocrites, whose friendship with the devil is
indivisible, whose repentance never faithful.

etc. must excuse our author for his severe adherence to this principle
of purifying the heart from habitual sin. But, the church refused to
press it against St. [Matt. xviii.

our own self-indulgent day, we are more prone, I fear, to presumption
than to over strictness. The Roman casuists make *attrition* suffice,
and so turn absolution into a mere sponge, and an encouragement to
perpetual sinning and formal confession.\]
