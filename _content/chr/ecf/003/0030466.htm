<p class="c19"><a name="v.iv.vi.xx-p2"></A>When (the apostle) mentions the several motives of those who were preaching the gospel, how that some, &#8220;waxing confident by his bonds, were more fearless in speaking the word,&#8221; while others &#8220;preached Christ even out of envy and strife, and again others out of good-will,&#8221; many also &#8220;out of love,&#8221; and certain &#8220;out of contention,&#8221; and some &#8220;in rivalry to himself,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6095"></A><A HREF="#fn_6095"><FONT SIZE="1">6096</FONT></A>
 he had a favourable opportunity, no doubt,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6096"></A><A HREF="#fn_6096"><FONT SIZE="1">6097</FONT></A>
 of taxing what they preached with a diversity of doctrine, as if it were no less than this which caused so great a variance in their tempers. But while he exposes these tempers as the sole cause of the diversity, he avoids inculpating the regular mysteries of the faith,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6097"></A><A HREF="#fn_6097"><FONT SIZE="1">6098</FONT></A>
 and affirms that there is, notwithstanding, but one Christ and His one God, whatever motives men had in preaching Him.&#160; Therefore, says he, it matters not to me &#8220;whether it be in pretence or in truth that Christ is preached,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6098"></A><A HREF="#fn_6098"><FONT SIZE="1">6099</FONT></A>
 because one Christ alone was announced, whether in their &#8220;pretentious&#8221; or their &#8220;truthful&#8221; faith. For it was to the faithfulness of their preaching that he applied the word <i>truth</i>, not to the rightness of the rule itself, because there was indeed but one rule; whereas the conduct of the preachers varied: in some of them it was true, <i>i.e.</i> single-minded, while in others it was sophisticated with over-much learning.&#160; This being the case, it is manifest that that Christ was the subject of their preaching who was always the theme of the prophets. Now, if it were a completely different Christ that was being introduced by the apostle, the novelty of the thing would have produced a diversity (in belief.). For there would not have been wanting, in spite of the novel teaching,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6099"></A><A HREF="#fn_6099"><FONT SIZE="1">6100</FONT></A>
 men to interpret the preached gospel of the Creator&#146;s Christ, since the majority of persons everywhere now-a-days are of our way of thinking, rather than on the heretical side. So that the apostle would not in such a passage as the present one have refrained from remarking and censuring the diversity.&#160; Since, however, there is no blame of a diversity, there is no proof of a novelty. Of course&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6100"></A><A HREF="#fn_6100"><FONT SIZE="1">6101</FONT></A>
 the Marcionites suppose that they have the apostle on their side in the following passage in the matter of Christ&#146;s substance&#8212;that in Him there was nothing but a phantom of flesh. For he says of Christ, that, &#8220;being in the form of God, He thought it not robbery to be equal with God;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6101"></A><A HREF="#fn_6101"><FONT SIZE="1">6102</FONT></A>
 but emptied&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6102"></A><A HREF="#fn_6102"><FONT SIZE="1">6103</FONT></A>
 Himself, and took upon Him the <i>form</i> of a servant,&#8221; <i>not the reality</i>, &#8220;and was made in the <i>likeness</i> of man,&#8221; <i>not a man</i>, &#8220;and was found in <i>fashion</i> as a man,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6103"></A><A HREF="#fn_6103"><FONT SIZE="1">6104</FONT></A>
 <i>not in his substance</i>, that is to say, his flesh; just as if to a sub<A NAME="page_473"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 473</FONT></A> <a name="v.iv.vi.xx-Page_473"></A>stance there did not accrue both <i>form</i> and <i>likeness</i> and <i>fashion</i>. It is well for us that in another passage (the apostle) calls Christ &#8220;the image of the invisible God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6104"></A><A HREF="#fn_6104"><FONT SIZE="1">6105</FONT></A>
 For will it not follow with equal force from that passage, that Christ is not truly God, because the apostle places Him in <i>the image</i> of God, if, (as Marcion contends,) He is not truly man because of His having taken on Him <i>the form</i> or <i>image</i> of a man? For in both cases the true substance will have to be excluded, if <i>image</i> (or &#8220;fashion&#8221;) and <i>likeness</i> and <i>form</i> shall be claimed for a phantom. But since he is truly God, as the Son of the Father, in His fashion and image, He has been already by the force of this conclusion determined to be truly man, as the Son of man, &#8220;found in the fashion&#8221; and image &#8220;of a man.&#8221;&#160; For when he propounded&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6105"></A><A HREF="#fn_6105"><FONT SIZE="1">6106</FONT></A>
 Him as thus &#8220;<i>found</i>&#8221; in the manner&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6106"></A><A HREF="#fn_6106"><FONT SIZE="1">6107</FONT></A>
 of a man, he <i>in fact</i> affirmed Him to be most certainly human. For what is <i>found</i>, manifestly possesses existence. Therefore, as He was found to be God by His mighty power, so was He found to be man by reason of His flesh, because the apostle could not have pronounced Him to have &#8220;become obedient unto death,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6107"></A><A HREF="#fn_6107"><FONT SIZE="1">6108</FONT></A>
 if He had not been constituted of a mortal substance. Still more plainly does this appear from the apostle&#146;s additional words, &#8220;even the death of the cross.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6108"></A><A HREF="#fn_6108"><FONT SIZE="1">6109</FONT></A>
 For he could hardly mean this to be a climax&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6109"></A><A HREF="#fn_6109"><FONT SIZE="1">6110</FONT></A>
 to the human suffering, to extol the virtue&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6110"></A><A HREF="#fn_6110"><FONT SIZE="1">6111</FONT></A>
 of His obedience, if he had known it all to be the imaginary process of a phantom, which rather eluded the cross than experienced it, and which displayed no virtue&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6111"></A><A HREF="#fn_6111"><FONT SIZE="1">6112</FONT></A>
 in the suffering, but only illusion. But &#8220;those things which he had once accounted gain,&#8221; and which he enumerates in the preceding verse&#8212;&#8220;trust in the flesh,&#8221; the sign of &#8220;circumcision,&#8221; his origin as &#8220;an Hebrew of the Hebrews,&#8221; his descent from &#8220;the tribe of Benjamin,&#8221; his dignity in the honours of the Pharisee&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6112"></A><A HREF="#fn_6112"><FONT SIZE="1">6113</FONT></A>
&#8212;he now reckons to be only &#8220;loss&#8221; to himself;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6113"></A><A HREF="#fn_6113"><FONT SIZE="1">6114</FONT></A>
 (in other words,) it was not the God of the Jews, but their stupid obduracy, which he repudiates. These are also the things &#8220;which he counts but dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6114"></A><A HREF="#fn_6114"><FONT SIZE="1">6115</FONT></A>
 (but by no means for the rejection of God the Creator); &#8220;whilst he has not his own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through Him,&#8221; <i>i.e.</i> Christ, &#8220;the righteousness which is of God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6115"></A><A HREF="#fn_6115"><FONT SIZE="1">6116</FONT></A>
 Then, say you, according to this distinction the law did not proceed from the God of Christ.&#160; Subtle enough! But here is something still more subtle for you. For when (the apostle) says, &#8220;Not (the righteousness) which is of the law, but that which is through Him,&#8221; he would not have used the phrase <i>through Him</i> of any other than Him to whom the law belonged. &#8220;Our conversation,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is in heaven.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6116"></A><A HREF="#fn_6116"><FONT SIZE="1">6117</FONT></A>
 I here recognise the Creator&#146;s ancient promise to Abraham: &#8220;I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6117"></A><A HREF="#fn_6117"><FONT SIZE="1">6118</FONT></A>
 Therefore &#8220;one star differeth from another star in glory.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6118"></A><A HREF="#fn_6118"><FONT SIZE="1">6119</FONT></A>
 If, again, Christ in His advent from heaven &#8220;shall change the body of our humiliation, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6119"></A><A HREF="#fn_6119"><FONT SIZE="1">6120</FONT></A>
 it follows that this body of ours shall rise again, which is now in a state of humiliation in its sufferings and according to the law of mortality drops into the ground. But how shall it be changed, if it shall have no real existence? If, however, this is only said of those who shall be found in the flesh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6120"></A><A HREF="#fn_6120"><FONT SIZE="1">6121</FONT></A>
 at the advent of God, and who shall have to be changed,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6121"></A><A HREF="#fn_6121"><FONT SIZE="1">6122</FONT></A>
 what shall they do who will rise first?&#160; They will have no substance from which to undergo a change. But he says (elsewhere), &#8220;We shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord (in the air).&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6122"></A><A HREF="#fn_6122"><FONT SIZE="1">6123</FONT></A>
 Then, if we are to be caught up alone with them, surely we shall likewise be changed together with them.</p>
