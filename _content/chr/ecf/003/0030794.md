<span id="vi.vii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.vii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Jesus Christ in His Incarnation
and Work a More Imitable Example Thereof.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.iii-p2"></span>And *this* species of the divine
patience indeed being, as it were, at a distance, may perhaps be
esteemed as among “things too high for us;” <span
id="fr_9025"></span>[9026](#fn_9025) but what is that which, in a
certain way, has been grasped by hand <span
id="fr_9026"></span>[9027](#fn_9026) among men openly on the earth? God
suffers Himself to be conceived in a mother’s womb, and awaits *the time
for birth*; and, when born, bears *the delay* of growing up; and, when
grown up, is not eager to be recognised, but is furthermore contumelious
to Himself, and is baptized by His own servant; and repels with words
alone the assaults of the tempter; while from being “Lord” He becomes
“Master,” teaching man to escape death, having been trained to the
exercise of the absolute forbearance of offended patience. <span
id="fr_9027"></span>[9028](#fn_9027) He did not strive; He did not cry
aloud; nor did any hear His voice in the streets.  He did not break the
bruised reed; the smoking flax He did not quench: for the prophet—nay,
the attestation of God Himself, placing His own Spirit, together with
patience in its entirety, in His Son—had not falsely spoken. There was
none desirous of cleaving to Him whom He did not receive. No one’s table
or roof did He despise: indeed, Himself ministered to the washing of the
disciples’ feet; not sinners, not publicans, did He repel; not with that
city even which had refused to receive Him was He wroth, <span
id="fr_9028"></span>[9029](#fn_9028) when even the disciples had wished
that the celestial fires should be forthwith hurled on so contumelious a
town. He cared for the ungrateful; He yielded to His ensnarers. This
were a small matter, if He had not had in His company even His own
betrayer, and stedfastly abstained from pointing him out. Moreover,
while He is being betrayed, while He is being led up “as a sheep for a
victim,” (for “so He no more opens His mouth than a lamb under the power
of the shearer,”)He to whom, had He willed it, legions of angels would
at one word have presented themselves from the heavens, approved not the
avenging sword of even one disciple. The patience of the Lord was
wounded in (the wound of) Malchus. And so, too, He cursed for the time
to come the works of the sword; and, by the restoration of health, made
satisfaction to him whom Himself had not hurt, through Patience, the
mother of Mercy. I pass by in silence (the fact) that He is crucified,
for this was the end for which He had come; yet had the death which must
be undergone need of contumelies likewise? <span
id="fr_9029"></span>[9030](#fn_9029) *Nay*, but, when about to depart,
He wished to be sated with the pleasure of patience. He is spitted on,
scourged, derided, clad foully, more foully crowned.  Wondrous is the
faith of equanimity!  He who had set before *Him* the concealing of
Himself in man’s shape, imitated nought of man’s impatience! Hence, even
more than from any other trait, ought ye, Pharisees, to have recognised
the Lord. Patience of this kind none of *men* would achieve. Such and so
mighty evidences—the *very* magnitude of which proves to be among the
nations indeed a cause for rejection of the faith, but among us its
reason and rearing—proves manifestly enough (not by the sermons only, in
enjoining, but likewise by the sufferings of the Lord in enduring) to
them to whom it is given to believe, that as the effect and excellence
of some inherent propriety, patience is God’s nature.
