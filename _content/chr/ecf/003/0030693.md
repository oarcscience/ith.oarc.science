<span id="v.x.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.x.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.</span>

<span id="v.x.xii-p2"></span>Who, now, should know better the marrow of
the Scriptures than the school of Christ itself?—the persons whom the
Lord both chose for Himself as scholars, certainly to be fully
instructed in all points, and appointed to us for masters to instruct us
in all points. To whom would He have rather made known the veiled import
of His own language, than to him to whom He disclosed the likeness of
His own glory—to Peter, John, and James, and afterwards to Paul, to whom
He granted participation in (the joys of) paradise too, prior to his
martyrdom? Or do they also write differently from what they
think—teachers using deceit, not truth? Addressing the Christians of
Pontus, Peter, at all events, says, “How great indeed is the glory, if
ye suffer patiently, without being punished as evildoers! For this is a
lovely feature, *and* even hereunto were ye called, since Christ also
suffered for us, leaving you Himself as an example, that ye should
follow His own steps.” <span id="fr_8292"></span>[8293](#fn_8292) And
again:  “Beloved, be not alarmed by the fiery trial which is taking
place among you, as though some strange thing happened unto you. For,
inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings, do ye rejoice;
that, when His glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with
exceeding joy. If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, happy are
ye; because glory and the Spirit of God rest upon you: if only none of
you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evil-doer, or as a
busybody in other men’s matters; yet (if any man suffer) as a Christian,
let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf.” <span
id="fr_8293"></span>[8294](#fn_8293) John, <span id="page_646">p.
646</span> <span id="v.x.xii-Page_646"></span>in fact, exhorts us to lay
down our lives even for our brethren, <span
id="fr_8294"></span>[8295](#fn_8294) affirming that there is no fear in
love:  “For perfect love casteth out fear, since fear has punishment;
and he who fears is not perfect in love.” <span
id="fr_8295"></span>[8296](#fn_8295) What fear would it be better to
understand (as here meant), than that which gives rise to denial? What
love does he assert to be perfect, but that which puts fear to flight,
and gives courage to confess? What penalty will he appoint as the
punishment of fear, but that which he who denies is about to pay, who
has to be slain, body and soul, in hell? And if he teaches that we must
die for the brethren, how much more for the Lord,—he being sufficiently
prepared, by his own Revelation too, for giving such advice! For indeed
the Spirit had sent the injunction to the angel of the church in
Smyrna:  “Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye
may be tried ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee
a crown of life.” <span id="fr_8296"></span>[8297](#fn_8296) Also to the
angel of the church in Pergamus (mention was made) of Antipas, <span
id="fr_8297"></span>[8298](#fn_8297) the very faithful martyr, who was
slain where Satan dwelleth. Also to the angel of the church in
Philadelphia <span id="fr_8298"></span>[8299](#fn_8298) (it was
signified) that he who had not denied the name of the Lord was delivered
from the last trial. Then to every conqueror the Spirit promises now the
tree of life, and exemption from the second death; now the hidden manna
with the stone of glistening whiteness, and the name unknown (to every
man save him that receiveth it); now power to rule with a rod of iron,
and the brightness of the morning star; now the being clothed in white
raiment, and not having the name blotted out of the book of life, and
being made in the temple of God a pillar with the inscription on it of
the name of God and of the Lord, and of the heavenly Jerusalem; now a
sitting with the Lord on His throne,—which once was persistently refused
to the sons of Zebedee. <span id="fr_8299"></span>[8300](#fn_8299) Who,
pray, are these so blessed conquerors, but martyrs in the strict sense
of the word?  For indeed theirs are the victories whose also are the
fights; theirs, however, are the fights whose also is the blood. But the
souls of the martyrs both peacefully rest in the meantime under the
altar, <span id="fr_8300"></span>[8301](#fn_8300) and support their
patience by the assured hope of revenge; and, clothed in their robes,
wear the dazzling halo of brightness, until others also may fully share
in their glory. For yet again a countless throng are revealed, clothed
in white and distinguished by palms of victory, celebrating their
triumph doubtless over Antichrist, since one of the elders says, “These
are they who come out of that great tribulation, and have washed their
robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.” <span
id="fr_8301"></span>[8302](#fn_8301) For the flesh is the clothing of
the soul. The uncleanness, indeed, is washed away by baptism, but the
stains are changed into dazzling whiteness by martyrdom. For Esaias also
promises, that out of red and scarlet there will come forth the
whiteness of snow and wool. <span id="fr_8302"></span>[8303](#fn_8302)
When great Babylon likewise is represented as drunk with the blood of
the saints, <span id="fr_8303"></span>[8304](#fn_8303) doubtless the
supplies needful for her drunkenness are furnished by the cups of
martyrdoms; and what suffering the fear of martyrdoms will entail, is in
like manner shown. For among all the castaways, nay, taking precedence
of them all, are the fearful. “But the fearful,” says John—and then come
the others—“will have their part in the lake of fire and
brimstone.” <span id="fr_8304"></span>[8305](#fn_8304) Thus fear, which,
as stated in his epistle, love drives out, has punishment.
