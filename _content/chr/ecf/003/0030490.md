<span id="v.v.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—A Retort of Heresy Answered. That
Scripture Should in So Many Words Tell Us that the World Was Made of
Nothing is Superfluous.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxi-p2"></span>But, you will say to me, if you determine
that all things were made of nothing, on the ground that it is not told
us that anything was made out of pre-existent Matter, take care that it
be not contended on the opposite side, that on the same ground all
things were made out of Matter, because it is not likewise expressly
said that anything was made out of nothing. Some arguments may, of
course, <span id="fr_6333"></span>[6334](#fn_6333) be thus retorted
easily enough; but it does not follow that they are on that account
fairly admissible, where there is a diversity in the cause. For I
maintain that, even if the Scripture has not expressly declared that all
things were made out of nothing—just as it abstains (from saying that
they were formed) out of Matter—there was no such pressing need for
expressly indicating the creation of all things out of nothing, as there
was of their creation out of Matter, if that had been their origin.
Because, in the case of what is made out of nothing, the very fact of
its not being indicated that it was made of any particular thing shows
that it was made of nothing; and there is no danger of its being
supposed that it was made of anything, when there is no indication at
all of what it was made of.  In the case, however, of that which is made
out of something, unless the very fact be plainly declared, that it was
made out of something, there will be danger, until <span
id="fr_6334"></span>[6335](#fn_6334) it is shown of what it was made,
first of its appearing to be made of nothing, because it is not said of
what it was made; and then, should it be of such a nature <span
id="fr_6335"></span>[6336](#fn_6335) as to have the appearance of having
certainly been made of something, there will be a similar risk of its
seeming to have been made of a far different material from the proper
one, so long as there is an absence of statement of what it was made of.
Then, if God had been unable to make all things of nothing, the
Scripture could not possibly have added that He had made all things of
nothing: (there could have been no room for such a statement,) but it
must by all means have informed us that He had made all things out of
Matter, since Matter must have been the source; because the one case was
quite to be understood, <span id="fr_6336"></span>[6337](#fn_6336) if it
were not actually stated, whereas the other case would be left in doubt
unless it were stated.
