<span id="v.vi.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.vi.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—The Three Natures Again
Adverted to. They are All Exemplified Amongst Men. For Instance, by
Cain, and Abel, and Seth.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxix-p2"></span>I will now collect from different
sources, by way of conclusion, what they affirm concerning the
dispensation <span id="fr_6865"></span>[6866](#fn_6865) of the whole
human race. Having at first stated their views as to *man’s* threefold
nature—which was, however, united in one <span
id="fr_6866"></span>[6867](#fn_6866) in the case of Adam—they then
proceed after him to divide it (into three) with their especial
characteristics, finding opportunity for such distinction in the
posterity of Adam himself, in which occurs a threefold division as to
moral differences. Cain and Abel, and Seth, who were in a certain sense
the sources of the human race, become the fountain-heads of just as many
qualities <span id="fr_6867"></span>[6868](#fn_6867) of nature and
essential character. <span id="fr_6868"></span>[6869](#fn_6868) The
material nature, <span id="fr_6869"></span>[6870](#fn_6869) which had
become reprobate for salvation, they assign to Cain; the animal nature,
which was poised between divergent hopes, they find <span
id="fr_6870"></span>[6871](#fn_6870) in Abel; the spiritual, preordained
for certain salvation, they store up <span
id="fr_6871"></span>[6872](#fn_6871) in Seth. In this way also they make
a twofold distinction among souls, as to their property of good and
evil—according to the material condition derived from Cain, or the
animal from Abel. Men’s spiritual state they derive over and above the
other conditions, <span id="fr_6872"></span>[6873](#fn_6872) from Seth
adventitiously, <span id="fr_6873"></span>[6874](#fn_6873) not in the
way of nature, but of grace, <span id="fr_6874"></span>[6875](#fn_6874)
in such wise that Achamoth infuses it <span
id="fr_6875"></span>[6876](#fn_6875) among superior beings like
rain <span id="fr_6876"></span>[6877](#fn_6876) into good souls, that
is, those who are enrolled in the animal class. Whereas the material
class—in other words, those which are bad souls—they say, never receive
the blessings of salvation; <span id="fr_6877"></span>[6878](#fn_6877)
for that nature they have pronounced to be incapable of any change or
reform in its natural condition. <span
id="fr_6878"></span>[6879](#fn_6878) This grain, then, of spiritual seed
is modest and very small when cast from her hand, but under her
instruction <span id="fr_6879"></span>[6880](#fn_6879) increases and
advances into full conviction, as we have already said; <span
id="fr_6880"></span>[6881](#fn_6880) and the souls, on this very
account, so much excelled all others, that the Demiurge, even then in
his ignorance, held them in great esteem. For it was from their list
that he had been accustomed to select men for kings and for priests; and
these even now, if they have once attained to a full and complete
knowledge of these foolish conceits of theirs, <span
id="fr_6881"></span>[6882](#fn_6881) since they are already naturalized
in the fraternal bond of the spiritual state, will obtain a sure
salvation, nay, one which is on all accounts their due.
