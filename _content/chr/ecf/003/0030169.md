<span id="iv.viii.ii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—The Gods of the Different
Nations. Varro’s Gentile Class. Their Inferiority. A Good Deal of This
Perverse Theology Taken from Scripture. Serapis a Perversion of
Joseph.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.viii-p2"></span>There remains the *gentile* class
of gods amongst the several nations: <span
id="fr_905"></span>[906](#fn_905) these were adopted out of mere
caprice, not from the knowledge of the truth; and our information about
them comes from the private notions *of different races*. God, I
imagine, is everywhere known, everywhere present, powerful everywhere—an
object whom all ought to worship, all ought to serve. Since, then, it
happens that even they, whom all the world worships in common, fail in
the evidence of their true divinity, how much more must this befall
those whom their very votaries <span id="fr_906"></span>[907](#fn_906)
have not succeeded in discovering! For what useful authority could
possibly precede a theology of so defective a character as to be wholly
unknown to fame?  How many have either seen or heard of the Syrian
Atargatis, the African Cœlestis, the Moorish Varsutina, the Arabian
Obodas and Dusaris, or the Norican Belenus, or those whom Varro
mentions—Deluentinus of Casinum, Visidianus of Narnia, Numiternus of
Atina, *or* Ancharia of Asculum? And who have any clear notions <span
id="fr_907"></span>[908](#fn_907) of Nortia of Vulsinii? <span
id="fr_908"></span>[909](#fn_908) There is no difference in the worth of
even their names, apart from the human surnames which distinguish them.
I laugh often enough at the little coteries of gods <span
id="fr_909"></span>[910](#fn_909) in each municipality, which have their
honours confined within their own city walls. To what lengths this
licence of adopting gods has been pushed, the superstitious practices of
the Egyptians show us; for they worship even their native <span
id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910) animals, *such as* cats, crocodiles,
and their snake. It is therefore a small matter that they have also
deified a man—him, I mean, whom not Egypt only, or Greece, but the whole
world worships, and the Africans swear by; about whose state also all
that helps our conjectures and imparts to our knowledge the semblance of
truth is stated in our own (sacred) literature. For that Serapis of
yours was originally one of our own saints called Joseph. <span
id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911) The youngest of his brethren, but
superior to them in intellect, he was from envy sold into Egypt, and
became a slave in the family of Pharaoh king of the country. <span
id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912) Importuned by the unchaste queen, when
he refused to comply with her desire, she turned upon him and reported
him to the king, by whom he is put into prison.  There he displays the
power of his divine inspiration, by interpreting aright the dreams of
some (fellow-prisoners).  Meanwhile the king, too, has some terrible
dreams. Joseph being brought <span id="page_137">p. 137</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.viii-Page_137"></span>before him, according to his
summons, was able to expound them.  Having narrated the proofs of true
interpretation which he had given in the prison, he opens out his dream
to the king:  those seven fat-fleshed and well-favoured kine signified
as many years of plenty; in like manner, the seven lean-fleshed animals
predicted the scarcity of the seven following years.  He accordingly
recommends precautions to be taken against the future famine from the
previous plenty. The king believed him. The issue of all that happened
showed how wise he was, how invariably holy, and now how necessary. So
Pharaoh set him over all Egypt, that he might secure the provision of
corn for it, and thenceforth administer its government. They called him
Serapis, from the turban <span id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913) which
adorned his head. The peck-like <span id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914)
shape of this turban marks the memory of his corn-provisioning; whilst
evidence is given that the care of the supplies was all on his
head, <span id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915) by the very ears of corn
which embellish the border of the head-dress. For the same reason, also,
they made the sacred figure of a dog, <span
id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916) which they regard (as a sentry) in
Hades, and put it under his right hand, because the care of the
Egyptians was concentrated <span id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917) under
his hand. And they put at his side Pharia, <span
id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918) whose name shows her to have been the
king’s daughter. For in addition to all the rest of his kind gifts and
rewards, Pharaoh had given him his own daughter in marriage. Since,
however, they had begun to worship both wild animals and human beings,
they combined both figures under one form Anubis, in which there may
rather be seen clear proofs of its own character and condition
enshrined <span id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919) by a nation at war
with itself, refractory <span id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920) to its
kings, despised among foreigners, with even the appetite of a slave and
the filthy nature of a dog.
