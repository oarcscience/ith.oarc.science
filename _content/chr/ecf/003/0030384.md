<span id="v.iv.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—The Truly Incarnate State More
Worthy of God Than Marcion’s Fantastic Flesh.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.x-p2"></span>Therefore, since you are not permitted to
resort to any instances of the Creator, as alien from the subject, and
possessing special causes of their own, I should like you to state
yourself the design of your god, in exhibiting his Christ not in the
reality of flesh. If he despised it as earthly, and (as you express it)
full of dung, <span id="fr_3228"></span>[3229](#fn_3228) why did he not
on that account include the likeness of it also in his contempt? For no
honour is to be attributed to the image of anything which is itself
unworthy of honour. As the natural state is, so will the likeness be.
But how could he hold converse with men except in the image of human
substance? <span id="fr_3229"></span>[3230](#fn_3229) Why, then, not
rather in the reality thereof, that his intercourse might be real, since
he was under the necessity of holding it? And to how much better account
would this necessity have been turned by ministering to faith rather
than to a fraud! <span id="fr_3230"></span>[3231](#fn_3230) The god whom
you make is miserable enough, for this very reason that he was unable to
display his Christ except in the effigy of an unworthy, and indeed an
alien, thing. In some instances, it will be convenient to use even
unworthy things, if they be only our own, as it will also be quite
improper to use things, be they ever so worthy, if they be not our
own. <span id="fr_3231"></span>[3232](#fn_3231) Why, then, did he not
come in some other worthier substance, and especially his own, that he
might not seem as if he could not have done without an unworthy and an
alien one? Now, since my Creator held intercourse with man by means of
even a bush and fire, and again afterwards by means of a cloud and
column, <span id="fr_3232"></span>[3233](#fn_3232) and in
representations of Himself used bodies composed of the elements, these
examples of divine power afford sufficient proof that God did not
require the instrumentality of false or even of real flesh.  But yet, if
we look steadily into the subject, there is really no substance which is
worthy of becoming a vestment for God. Whatsoever He is pleased to
clothe Himself withal, He makes worthy of Himself—only without
untruth. <span id="fr_3233"></span>[3234](#fn_3233) Therefore how comes
it to pass that he should have thought the verity of the flesh, rather
than its unreality, a disgrace? Well, but he honoured it by his fiction
of it. How great, then, is that flesh, the very phantasy of which was a
necessity to the superior God!
