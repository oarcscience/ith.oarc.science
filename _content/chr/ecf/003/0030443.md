<span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c17"><span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p1.1"></span>Dr. Holmes’ Note.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p3"></span>Dr. Holmes appends the following as a
note to the Fourth Book.  (See cap. vi. p. 351.)

<span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p4"></span>The following statement, abridged from
Dr. Lardner (*The History of Heretics*, chap. x. secs. 35–40), may be
useful to the reader, in reference to the subject of the preceding
Book:—Marcion received but eleven books of the New Testament, and these
strangely curtailed and altered.  He divided them into two parts, which
he called <span class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p4.1"></span>τὸ
Εὐαγγέλιον</span> (*the Gospel*) and <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p4.2"></span>τὸ ᾽Αποστολικόν</span> (*the Apostolicon*).

<span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p5"></span>1. The former contained nothing more
than a mutilated, and sometimes interpolated, edition of <span
class="sc"><span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p5.2"></span>St. Luke</span>; the name
of that evangelist, however, he expunged from the beginning of his copy.
[Luke 1:0](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#000), [Luke
2:0](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#000)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p5.3"></span>. he rejected entirely, and began at [Luke
3.1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p5.4"></span>, reading the opening verse thus: “In the
xv. year of Tiberius Cæsar, God descended into Capernaum, a city of
Galilee.”

<span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p6"></span>2. According to Irenæus, Epiphanius,
and Theodoret, he rejected the genealogy and baptism of Christ; whilst
from Tertullian’s statement (chap. vii.) it seems likely that he
connected what part of chap. iii.—[Luke
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p6.1"></span>—he chose to retain, with [Luke
4.31](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#031)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p6.2"></span>, at a leap.

<span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p7"></span>3. He further eliminated the history of
the temptation.  That part of [Luke
4](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#000)<span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p7.1"></span>.
which narrates Christ’s going into the synagogue at Nazareth and reading
out of Isaiah he also rejected, and all afterwards to the end of [Luke
4.30](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#030)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p7.2"></span>.

<span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8"></span>4. Epiphanius mentions sundry slight
alterations in capp. v. 14, 24, vi. 5, 17. In [Luke
8.19](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#019)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.1"></span> he expunged <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.2"></span>ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ</span>.
From Tertullian’s remarks (chap. xix.), it would seem at first as if
Marcion had added to his Gospel that answer of our Saviour which we find
related by [Matt. 12.48](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#048)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.3"></span>: “Who is my mother, and who are my
brethren?” For he represents Marcion (as in *De carne Christi*, vii., he
represents other heretics, who deny the nativity) as making use of these
words for his favourite argument. But, after all, Marcion might use
these words against those who allowed the authenticity of Matthew’s
Gospel, without inserting them in his own Gospel; or else Tertullian
might quote from memory, and think that to be in Luke which was only in
Matthew—as he has done at least in three instances. (Lardner refers two
of these instances to passages in chap. vii. of this Book iv., where
Tertullian mentions, as erasures from Luke, what really are found in
[Matt. 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017), [Matt.
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.4"></span>. The third instance referred to by Lardner
probably occurs at the end of chap. ix. of this same Book iv., where
Tertullian <span id="page_424">p. 424</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-Page_424"></span>again mistakes [Matt. v.
17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017)<span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.5"></span>
for a passage of Luke, and charges Marcion with expunging it; curiously
enough, the mistake recurs in chap. xii of the same Book.) In [Luke x.
21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021)<span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.6"></span>
Marcion omitted the first <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.7"></span>πάτερ</span> and the words <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.8"></span>καὶ τῆς γῆς</span>,
that he might not allow Christ to call His Father the Lord of earth, or
of this world. The second <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.9"></span>πατήρ</span> in this verse, not open to any
inconvenience, he retained. In [chap. xi.
29](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#029)<span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.10"></span>
he omitted the last words concerning the sign of the prophet Jonah; he
also omitted all the [Luke
11.30-32](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#030)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.11"></span>; in [Luke
11.42](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#042)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.12"></span> he read <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.13"></span>κλῆσιν</span>, ‘*calling*,’ instead of
<span class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.14"></span>κρίσιν</span>
‘*judgment*.’ He rejected verses [Luke
11.49-51](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.15"></span>, because the passage related to the
prophets. He entirely omitted [Luke
12.6](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#006)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.16"></span>; whilst in [Luke
12.8](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#008)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.17"></span> he read <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.18"></span>ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> instead of <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.19"></span>ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἀγγέλων
τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>. He seems to have left out all the [Luke
12.28](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#028)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.20"></span>, and expunged <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.21"></span>ὑμῶν</span> from [Luke
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#030),
[32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.22"></span>, reading only <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.23"></span>ὁ πατήρ</span>. In [Luke
12.38](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#038)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.24"></span>, instead of the words <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.25"></span>ἐν τῇ δευτέρᾳ φυλακῇ,
καὶ ἐν τῇ τρίτῃ φυλακῇ</span>, he read <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.26"></span>ἐν τῇ ἑσπερινῇ φυλακῇ</span>. In [Luke
13](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#000)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.27"></span>. he omitted the [Luke
13.1-5](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#001)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.28"></span>, whilst in the [Luke
13.28](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#028)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.29"></span> of the same chapter, where we read, “When
ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the
kingdom of God, and ye yourselves thrust out,” he read (by altering,
adding, and transposing), “When ye shall see all the just in the kingdom
of God, and you yourselves cast out, and bound without, there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.” He likewise excluded all the [Luke
13.29-35](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#029)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.30"></span>. All [Luke
15.11-31](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#011)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.31"></span>, in which is contained the parable of the
prodigal son, he eliminated from his Gospel. In [Luke
17.10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.32"></span> he left out all the words after <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.33"></span>λέγετε</span>. He made
many alterations in the story of the ten lepers; he left out part of
[Luke 17.12-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#012)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.34"></span>, reading thus: “There met Him ten lepers;
and He sent them away, saying, Show yourselves to the priest;” after
which he inserted a clause from [Luke
4.27](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#027)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.35"></span>: “There were many lepers in the days of
Eliseus the prophet, but none of them were cleansed, but Naaman the
Syrian.” In [Luke 18.19](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#019)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.36"></span> he added the words <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.37"></span>ὁ πατήρ</span>, and in
[Luke 18.20](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#020)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.38"></span> altered <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.39"></span>οἶδας</span>, *thou knowest*, into the
first person. He entirely omitted [Luke
18.31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#031)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.40"></span>, in which our blessed Saviour declares
that the things foretold by the prophets concerning His sufferings, and
death, and resurrection, should all be fulfilled. He expunged *nineteen*
verses out of chap. xix., from the [Luke
19.27-47](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#027)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.41"></span>. In chap. xx. he omitted *ten* verses,
from the [Luke 20.8-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#008)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.42"></span>. He rejected also [Luke
20.37-38](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#037)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.43"></span>, in which there is a reference to Moses.
Marcion also erased of [Luke
21.1-22](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#001)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.44"></span>, on account of this clause, “that all
things which are written may be fulfilled;” [Luke
20.16](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#016)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.45"></span> was left out by him, so also [Luke
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#035),
[50](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#050)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.46"></span> (and, adds Lardner, conjecturally, not
herein following his authority Epiphanius, also [Luke
20:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#038),
[49](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#049)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.47"></span>). In [Luke
23.2](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#002)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.48"></span>, after the words “perverting the nation,”
Marcion added, “and destroying the law and the prophets;” and again,
after “forbidding to give tribute unto Cæsar,” he added, “and perverting
women and children.” He also erased [Luke
23.43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.49"></span>. In [Luke
24](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#000)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.50"></span>. he omitted that part of the conference
between our Saviour and the two disciples going to Emmaus, which related
to the prediction of His sufferings, and which is contained in [Luke
24.26-27](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.51"></span>. These two verses he omitted, and changed
the words at the end of [Luke
24.25](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.52"></span>, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.53"></span>ἐλάλησαν οἱ προφῆται</span>, into <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.54"></span>ἐλάλησα ὑμῖν</span>.
Such are the alterations, according to Epiphanius, which Marcion made in
his Gospel from St. Luke. Tertullian says (in the 4th chapter of the
preceding Book) that Marcion erased the passage which gives an account
of the parting of the raiment of our Saviour among the soldiers. But the
reason he assigns for the erasure—‘*respiciens Psalmi prophetiam*’—shows
that in this, as well as in the few other instances which we have
already named, where Tertullian has charged Marcion with so altering
passages, his memory deceived him into mistaking Matthew for Luke, for
the reference to the passage in the Psalm is only given by St. [Matthew
xxvii. 35](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#035)<span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-p8.55"></span>.

<span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p9"></span>5. On an impartial review of these
alterations, some seem to be but slight; others might be nothing but
various readings; but others, again, are undoubtedly designed
perver<span id="page_425">p. 425</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xliv-Page_425"></span>sions. There were, however, passages
enough left unaltered and unexpunged by the Marcionites, to establish
the reality of the flesh and blood of Christ, and to prove that the God
of the Jews was the Father of Christ, and of perfect goodness as well as
justice. Tertullian, indeed, observes (chap. xliii.) that “Marcion
purposely avoided erasing all the passages which made against him, that
he might with the greater confidence deny having erased any at all, or
at least that what he had omitted was for very good reasons.”

<span id="v.iv.v.xliv-p10"></span>6. To show the unauthorized and
unwarrantable character of these alterations, omissions, additions, and
corruptions, the Catholic Christians asserted that their copies of St.
Luke’s Gospel were more ancient than Marcion’s (so Tertullian in chap.
iii. and iv. of this Book iv.); and they maintained also the genuineness
and integrity of the unadulterated Gospel, in opposition to that which
had been curtailed and altered by him (chap. v.).
