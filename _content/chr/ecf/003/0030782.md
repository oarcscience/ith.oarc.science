<span id="vi.vi.i-p5"></span> ————————————

<span id="vi.vi.i-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.vi.i-p6.1"></span>Nobody</span>, will blame me for placing here
the touching history of these Martyrs.  It illustrates the period of
history we are now considering, and sheds light on the preceding
treatise. I can hardly read it without tears, and it ought to make us
love “the noble army of martyrs.” I think Tertullian was the *editor* of
the story, not its author. <span id="fr_8969"></span>[8970](#fn_8969)
Felicitas is mentioned by name in the *De Anima*: and the closing
paragraph of this memoir is quite in his style. To these words I need
only add that Dr. Routh, who unfortunately decided not to re-edit it,
ascribes the first edition to Lucas Holstenius.  He was Librarian of the
Vatican and died in 1661. The rest may be learned from this <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.vi.i-p7.1"></span>Introductory Notice</span> of
the Translator:

<span id="vi.vi.i-p8"></span>Perpetua and Felicitas suffered martyrdom
in the reign of Septimius Severus, about the year 202 <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.vi.i-p8.2"></span>a.d.</span> Tertullian
mentions Perpetua, <span id="fr_8970"></span>[8971](#fn_8970) and a
further clue to the date is given in the allusion to the birth-day of
“Geta the Cæsar,” the son of Septimius Severus.  There is therefore,
good reason for rejecting the opinion held by some, that they suffered
under Valerian and Gallienus. Some think that they suffered at Tuburbium
in Mauritania; but the more general opinion is, that Carthage was the
scene of their martyrdom.

<span id="vi.vi.i-p10"></span>The “Acta,” detailing the sufferings of
Perpetua and Felicitas, has been held by all critics to be a genuine
document of antiquity. But much difference exists as to who was the
compiler. In the writing itself, Perpetua and Saturus are mentioned as
having written certain portions of it; and there is no reason to doubt
the statement. Who the writer of the remaining portion was, is not
known. Some have assigned the work to Tertullian; some have maintained
that, whoever the writer was, he was a Montanist, and some have tried to
show that both martyrs and narrator were Montanists. <span
id="fr_8971"></span>[8972](#fn_8971) The narrator must have been a
contemporary; according to many critics, he was an eye-witness of the
sufferings of the martyrs. And he must have written the narrative
shortly after the events.

<span id="vi.vi.i-p12"></span>Dean Milman says, “There appear strong
indications that the acts of these African martyrs are translated from
the Greek; at least it is difficult otherwise to account for the
frequent untranslated Greek words and idioms in the text. <span
id="fr_8972"></span>[8973](#fn_8972)

<span id="vi.vi.i-p14"></span>The Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas was
edited by Petrus Possinus, Rome, 1663; by Henr. Valesius, Paris, 1664;
and the Bollandists. The best and latest edition is by Ruissart, whose
text is adopted in Gallandi’s and Migne’s collections of the Fathers.
