<p class="c19"><a name="vi.v.iv-p2"></A>From the saying of our Lord we know that the flesh is weak, the spirit willing.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8966"></A><A HREF="#fn_8966"><FONT SIZE="1">8967</FONT></A>
 Let us not, withal, take delusive comfort from the Lord&#146;s acknowledgment of the weakness of the flesh. For precisely on this account He first declared the spirit willing, that He might show which of the two ought to be subject to the other&#8212;that the flesh might yield obedience to the spirit&#8212;the weaker to the stronger; the <A NAME="page_695"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 695</FONT></A> <a name="vi.v.iv-Page_695"></A>former thus from the latter getting strength. Let the spirit hold convene with the flesh about the common salvation, thinking no longer of the troubles of the prison, but of the wrestle and conflict for which they are the preparation. The flesh, perhaps, will dread the merciless sword, and the lofty cross, and the rage of the wild beasts, and that punishment of the flames, of all most terrible, and all the skill of the executioner in torture. But, on the other side, let the spirit set clearly before both itself and the flesh, how these things, though exceeding painful, have yet been calmly endured by many,&#8212;and, have even been eagerly desired for the sake of fame and glory; and this not only in the case of men, but of women too, that you, O holy women, may be worthy of your sex. It would take me too long to enumerate one by one the men who at their own self-impulse have put an end to themselves. As to women, there is a famous case at hand: the violated Lucretia, in the presence of her kinsfolk, plunged the knife into herself, that she might have glory for her chastity.&#160; Mucius burned his right hand on an altar, that this deed of his might dwell in fame. The philosophers have been outstripped,&#8212;for instance Heraclitus, who, smeared with cow dung, burned himself; and Empedocles, who leapt down into the fires of &AElig;tna; and Peregrinus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8967"></A><A HREF="#fn_8967"><FONT SIZE="1">8968</FONT></A>
 who not long ago threw himself on the funeral pile. For women even have despised the flames. Dido did so, lest, after the death of a husband very dear to her, she should be compelled to marry again; and so did the wife of Hasdrubal, who, Carthage being on fire, that she might not behold her husband suppliant as Scipio&#146;s feet, rushed with her children into the conflagration, in which her native city was destroyed. Regulus, a Roman general, who had been taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, declined to be exchanged for a large number of Carthaginian captives, choosing rather to be given back to the enemy. He was crammed into a sort of chest; and, everywhere pierced by nails driven from the outside, he endured so many crucifixions. Woman has voluntarily sought the wild beasts, and even asps, those serpents worse than bear or bull, which Cleopatra applied to herself, that she might not fall into the hands of her enemy. But the fear of death is not so great as the fear of torture. And so the Athenian courtezan succumbed to the executioner, when, subjected to torture by the tyrant for having taken part in a conspiracy, still making no betrayal of her confederates, she at last bit off her tongue and spat it in the tyrant&#146;s face, that he might be convinced of the uselessness of his torments, however long they should be continued. Everybody knows what to this day is the great Laced&aelig;monian solemnity&#8212;the <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.v.iv-p4.3"></A>&#948;&#953;&#945;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8059;&#947;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>, or scourging; in which sacred rite the Spartan youths are beaten with scourges before the altar, their parents and kinsmen standing by and exhorting them to stand it bravely out. For it will be always counted more honourable and glorious that the soul rather than the body has given itself to stripes. But if so high a value is put on the earthly glory, won by mental and bodily vigour, that men, for the praise of their fellows, I may say, despise the sword, the fire, the cross, the wild beasts, the torture; these surely are but trifling sufferings to obtain a celestial glory and a divine reward. If the bit of glass is so precious, what must the true pearl be worth? Are we not called on, then, most joyfully to lay out as much for the true as others do for the false?</p>
