<span id="iv.iii.xxxvi-p2"></span>If it is the fact that men bearing the
name of Romans are found to be enemies of Rome, why are we, on the
ground that we are regarded as enemies, denied the name of Romans? *We*
may be at once Romans and foes of Rome, when men passing for Romans are
discovered to be enemies of their country.  So the affection, and
fealty, and reverence, due to the emperors do not consist in such tokens
of homage as these, which even hostility may be zealous in performing,
chiefly as a cloak to its purposes; but in those ways which Deity as
certainly enjoins on us, as they are held to be necessary in the case of
all men as well as emperors. Deeds of true heart-goodness are not due by
us to emperors alone. We never do good with respect of persons; for in
our own interest we conduct ourselves as those who take no payment
either of praise or premium <span id="page_45">p. 45</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xxxvi-Page_45"></span>from man, but from God, who both
requires and remunerates an impartial benevolence. <span
id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128) We are the same to emperors as to our
ordinary neighbors. For we are equally forbidden to wish ill, to do ill,
to speak ill, to think ill of all men. The thing we must not do to an
emperor, we must not do to any one else: what we would not do to
anybody, a *fortiori*, perhaps we should not do to him whom God has been
pleased so highly to exalt.
