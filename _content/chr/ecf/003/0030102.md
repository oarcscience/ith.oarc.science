<span id="iv.v.xviii-p2"></span>But if you argue that the racecourse is
mentioned in Scripture, I grant it at once. But you will not refuse to
admit that the things which are done there are not for you to look upon:
the blows, and kicks, and cuffs, and all the recklessness of hand, and
everything like that disfiguration of the human countenance, which is
nothing less than the disfiguration of God’s own image. You will never
give your approval to those foolish racing and throwing feats, and yet
more foolish leapings; you will never find pleasure in injurious or
useless exhibitions of strength; certainly you will not regard with
approval those efforts after an artificial body which aim at surpassing
the Creator’s work; and you will have the very opposite of complacency
in the athletes Greece, in the inactivity of peace, feeds up. And the
wrestler’s art is a devil’s thing. The devil wrestled with, and crushed
to death, the first human beings.  Its very attitude has power in it of
the serpent kind, firm to hold—tortures to clasp—slippery to glide
away.  You have no need of crowns; why do you strive to get pleasures
from crowns?
