id="v.vi.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—The Demiurge Cured of His
Ignorance by the Saviour’s Advent, from Whom He Hears of the Great
Future in Store for Himself.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxviii-p2"></span>Meanwhile the Demiurge, being still
ignorant of everything, although he will actually have to make some
announcement himself by the prophets, but is quite incapable of even
this part of his duty (because they divide authority over the
prophets <span id="fr_6863"></span>[6864](#fn_6863) between Achamoth,
the Seed, and the Demiurge), no sooner <span id="page_517">p. 517</span>
<span id="v.vi.xxviii-Page_517"></span>heard of the advent of Soter
(*Saviour*) than he runs to him with haste and joy, with all his might,
like the centurion in the Gospel. <span
id="fr_6864"></span>[6865](#fn_6864) And being enlightened by him on all
points, he learns from him also of his own prospect how that he is to
succeed to his mother’s place. Being thenceforth free from all care, he
carries on the administration of this world, mainly under the plea of
protecting the church, for as long a time as may be necessary and
proper.
