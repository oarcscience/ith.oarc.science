<span id="iv.viii.i.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI. <span
id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697) —Other Charges Repelled by the Same
Method. The Story of the Noble Roman Youth and His Parents.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xvi-p3"></span>I am now come to the hour for
extinguishing the lamps, and for using the dogs, and practising the
deeds of darkness. And on this point I am afraid I must succumb to you;
for what similar accusation shall I have to bring against you? But you
should at once commend the cleverness with which we make our incest look
modest, in that we have devised a spurious night, <span
id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698) to avoid polluting the real light and
darkness, and have even thought it right to dispense with earthly
lights, and to play tricks also with our conscience. For whatever we do
ourselves, we suspect in others when we choose (to be suspicious). As
for your incestuous deeds, on the contrary, <span
id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699) men enjoy them at full liberty, in the
face of day, or in the natural night, or before high Heaven; and in
proportion to their successful issue is your own ignorance of the
result, since you publicly indulge in your incestuous intercourse in the
full cognizance of broad day-light. (No ignorance, however, conceals our
conduct from our eyes,) for in the very darkness we are able to
recognise our own misdeeds. The Persians, you know very well, <span
id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700) according to Ctesias, live quite
promiscuously with their mothers, in full knowledge of the fact, and
without any horror; whilst of the Macedonians it is well known that they
constantly do the same thing, and with perfect approbation: for once,
when the blinded <span id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701) Œdipus came
upon their stage, they greeted him with laughter and derisive cheers.
The actor, taking off his mask in great alarm, said, “Gentlemen, have I
displeased you?” “Certainly not,” replied the Macedonians, “you have
played your part well enough; but either the author was very silly, if
he invented (this mutilation as an atonement for the incest), or else
Œdipus was a great fool for his pains if he really so punished himself;”
and then they shouted out one to the other, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xvi-p7.1"></span>῝Ηλσυνε εἰς τὴν μητέρα</span>. But how
insignificant, (say you,) is the stain which one or two nations can make
on the whole world! As for us, we of course have infected the very sun,
polluted the entire ocean!  Quote, then, one nation which is free from
the passions which allure the whole race of men to incest! If there is a
single nation which knows nothing of concubinage through the necessity
of age and sex—to say nothing of lust and licentiousness—that nation
will be a stranger to incest. If any nature can be found so peculiarly
removed from the human state as to be liable neither to ignorance, nor
error, nor misfortune, that alone may be adduced with any consistency as
an answer to the Christians. Reflect, therefore, on the licentiousness
which floats about amongst men’s passions <span
id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702) as if they were the winds, and
consider whether there be any communities which the full and strong
tides of passion fail to waft to the commission of this great sin. In
the first place, when you expose your infants to the mercy of others, or
leave them for adoption to better parents than yourselves, do you forget
what an opportunity for incest is furnished, how wide a scope is opened
for its accidental commission? Undoubtedly, such of you as are more
serious from a principle of self-restraint and careful reflection,
abstain from lusts which could produce results of such a kind, in
whatever place you may happen to be, at home or abroad, so that no
indiscriminate diffusion of seed, or licentious reception thereof, will
produce chil<span id="page_125">p. 125</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.xvi-Page_125"></span>dren to you unawares, such as their
very parents, or else other children, might encounter in inadvertent
incest, for no restraint from age is regarded in (the importunities of)
lust. All acts of adultery, all cases of fornication, all the
licentiousness of public brothels, whether committed at home or
perpetrated out of doors, <span id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703) serve
to produce confusions of blood and complications of natural
relationship, <span id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704) and thence to
conduce to incest; from which consummation your players and buffoons
draw the materials of their exhibitions. It was from such a source, too,
that so flagrant a tragedy recently burst upon the public as that which
the prefect Fuscianus had judicially to decide. A boy of noble birth,
who, by the unintentional neglect of his attendants, <span
id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705) had strolled too far from home, was
decoyed by some passers-by, and carried off. The paltry Greek <span
id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706) who had the care of him, or somebody
else, <span id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707) in true Greek fashion, had
gone into the house and captured him. Having been taken away into Asia,
he is brought, when arrived at full age, back to Rome, and exposed for
sale. His own father buys him unawares, and treats him as a Greek. <span
id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708) Afterwards, as was his wont, the youth
is sent by his master into the fields, chained as a slave. <span
id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709) Thither the tutor and the nurse had
already been banished for punishment. The whole case is represented to
them; they relate each other’s misfortunes: they, on the one hand, how
they had lost their ward when he was a boy; he, on the other hand, that
he had been lost from his boyhood. But they agreed in the main, that he
was a native of Rome of a noble family; perhaps he further gave sure
proofs of his identity.  Accordingly, as God willed it for the purpose
of fastening a stain upon that age, a presentiment about the time
excites him, the periods exactly suit his age, even his eyes help to
recall <span id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710) his features, some
peculiar marks on his body are enumerated. His master and mistress, who
are now no other than his own father and mother, anxiously urge a
protracted inquiry. The slave-dealer is examined, the unhappy truth is
all discovered. When their wickedness becomes manifest, the parents find
a remedy for their despair by hanging themselves; to their son, who
survives the miserable calamity, their property is awarded by the
prefect, not as an inheritance, but as the wages of infamy and incest.
That one case was a sufficient example for public exposure <span
id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711) of the sins of this sort which are
secretly perpetrated among you. Nothing happens among men in solitary
isolation. But, as it seems to me, it is only in a solitary case that
such a charge can be drawn out against us, even in the mysteries of our
religion. You ply us evermore with this charge; <span
id="fr_712"></span>[713](#fn_712) yet there are like delinquencies to be
traced amongst you, even in your ordinary course of life. <span
id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713)
