<span id="iv.iii.xxxi-p2"></span>But we merely, you say, flatter the
emperor, and feign these prayers of ours to escape persecution. Thank
you for your mistake, for you give us the opportunity of proving our
allegations. Do you, then, who think that we care nothing for the
welfare of Cæsar, look into God’s revelations, examine our sacred books,
which we do not keep in hiding, and which many accidents put into the
hands of those who are not of us. Learn from them that a large
benevolence is enjoined upon us, even so far as to supplicate God for
our enemies, and to beseech blessings on our persecutors. <span
id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119) Who, then, are greater enemies and
persecutors of Christians, than the very parties with treason against
whom we are charged? Nay, even in terms, and most clearly, the Scripture
says, “Pray for kings, and rulers, and powers, that all may be peace
with you.” <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120) For when there is
disturbance in the empire, if the commotion is felt by its other
members, surely we too, though we are not thought to be given to
disorder, are to be found in some place or other which the calamity
affects.
