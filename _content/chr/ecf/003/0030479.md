<span id="v.v.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.v.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—To What Straits Hermogenes Absurdly
Reduces the Divine Being. He Does Nothing Short of Making Him the Author
of Evil.</span>

<span id="v.v.x-p2"></span>Even if Matter had been the perfection of
good, <span id="fr_6218"></span>[6219](#fn_6218) would it not have been
equally indecorous in Him to have thought of the property of another,
however good, (to effect His purpose by the help of it)? It was,
therefore, absurd enough for Him, in the interest of His own glory, to
have created the world in such a way as to betray His own obligation to
a substance which belonged to another—and that even not good. Was He
then, asks (Hermogenes), to make all things out of nothing, that so evil
things themselves might be attributed to His will?  Great, in all
conscience, <span id="fr_6219"></span>[6220](#fn_6219) must be the
blindness of our heretics which leaves them to argue in such a way that
they either insist on the belief of another God supremely good, on the
ground of their thinking the Creator to be the author of evil, or else
they set up Matter with the Creator, in order that they may derive evil
from Matter, not from the Creator. And yet there is absolutely no god at
all that is free from such a doubtful plight, so as to be able to avoid
the appearance even of being the author of evil, whosoever he is that—I
will not say, indeed, has made, but still—has permitted evil to be made
by some author or other, and from some source or other. Hermogenes,
therefore, ought to be told <span id="fr_6220"></span>[6221](#fn_6220)
at once, although we postpone to another place our distinction
concerning the mode of evil, <span id="fr_6221"></span>[6222](#fn_6221)
that even he has effected no result by this device of his. <span
id="fr_6222"></span>[6223](#fn_6222) For observe how God is found to be,
if not the Author of, yet at any rate the conniver at, <span
id="fr_6223"></span>[6224](#fn_6223) evil, inasmuch as He, with all His
extreme goodness, endured evil in Matter be<span id="page_483">p.
483</span> <span id="v.v.x-Page_483"></span>fore He created the world,
although, as being good, and the enemy of evil, He ought to have
corrected it. For He either was able to correct it, but was unwilling;
or else was willing, but being a weak God, was not able. If He was able
and yet unwilling, He was Himself evil, as having favoured evil; and
thus He now opens Himself to the charge of evil, because even if He did
not create it yet still, since it would not be existing if He had been
against its existence, He must Himself have then caused it to exist,
when He refused to will its non-existence. And what is more shameful
than this? When He willed that to be which He was Himself unwilling to
create, He acted in fact against His very self, <span
id="fr_6224"></span>[6225](#fn_6224) inasmuch as He was both willing
that that should exist which He was unwilling to make, and unwilling to
make that which He was willing should exist. As if what He willed was
good, and at the same time what he refused to be the Maker of was evil.
What He judged to be evil by not creating it, He also proclaimed to be
good by permitting it to exist. By bearing with evil as a good instead
of rather extirpating it, He proved Himself to be the promoter thereof;
criminally, <span id="fr_6225"></span>[6226](#fn_6225) if through His
own will—disgracefully, if through necessity. God must either be the
servant of evil or the friend thereof, since He held converse with evil
in Matter—nay, more, effected His works out of the evil thereof.
