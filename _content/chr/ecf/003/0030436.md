<span id="v.iv.v.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv.v.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.—Christ and Zacchæus. The
Salvation of the Body as Denied by Marcion. The Parable of the Ten
Servants Entrusted with Ten Pounds.  Christ a Judge, Who is to
Administer the Will of the Austere Man, I.e. The Creator.</span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xxxvii-p2"></span>“Salvation comes to the house” of
Zac<span id="page_412">p. 412</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xxxvii-Page_412"></span>chæus even. <span
id="fr_4961"></span>[4962](#fn_4961) For what reason? Was it because he
also believed that Christ came by Marcion? But the blind man’s cry was
still sounding in the ears of all:  “Jesus, Thou Son of David, have
mercy on me.” And “all the people gave praise unto God”—not Marcion’s,
but David’s. Now, although Zacchæus was probably a Gentile, <span
id="fr_4962"></span>[4963](#fn_4962) he yet from his intercourse with
Jews had obtained a smattering <span
id="fr_4963"></span>[4964](#fn_4963) of their Scriptures, and, more than
this, had, without knowing it, fulfilled the precepts of Isaiah: “Deal
thy bread,” said the prophet, “to the hungry, and bring the poor that
are cast out into thine house.” <span
id="fr_4964"></span>[4965](#fn_4964) This he did in the best possible
way, by receiving the Lord, and entertaining Him in his house. “When
thou seest the naked cover him.” <span
id="fr_4965"></span>[4966](#fn_4965) This he promised to do, in an
equally satisfactory way, when he offered the half of his goods for all
works of mercy. <span id="fr_4966"></span>[4967](#fn_4966) So also “he
loosened the bands of wickedness, undid the heavy burdens, let the
oppressed go free, and broke every yoke,” <span
id="fr_4967"></span>[4968](#fn_4967) when he said, “If I have taken
anything from any man by false accusation, I restore him
fourfold.” <span id="fr_4968"></span>[4969](#fn_4968) Therefore the Lord
said, “This day is salvation come to this house.” <span
id="fr_4969"></span>[4970](#fn_4969) Thus did He give His testimony,
that the precepts of the Creator spoken by the prophet tended to
salvation. <span id="fr_4970"></span>[4971](#fn_4970) But when He adds,
“For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was
lost,” <span id="fr_4971"></span>[4972](#fn_4971) my present contention
is not whether *He* was come to save what was lost, *to whom* it had
once belonged, and *from whom* what He came to save had fallen away; but
I approach a different question. *Man*, there can be no doubt of it, is
here the subject of consideration. Now, since he consists of two
parts, <span id="fr_4972"></span>[4973](#fn_4972) body and soul, the
point to be inquired into is, in which of these two man would seem to
have been lost? If in his body, then it is his body, not his soul, which
is lost. What, however, is lost, the Son of man saves. The body, <span
id="fr_4973"></span>[4974](#fn_4973) therefore, has the salvation. If,
(on the other hand,) it is in his soul that man is lost, salvation is
designed for the lost soul; and the body which is not lost is safe. If,
(to take the only other supposition,) man is wholly lost, in both his
natures, then it necessarily follows that salvation is appointed for the
entire man; and then the opinion of the heretics is shivered to
pieces, <span id="fr_4974"></span>[4975](#fn_4974) who say that there is
no salvation of the flesh. And this affords a confirmation that Christ
belongs to the Creator, who followed the Creator in promising the
salvation of the whole man. The parable also of the (ten) servants, who
received their several recompenses according to the manner in which they
had increased their lord’s money by trading <span
id="fr_4975"></span>[4976](#fn_4975) proves Him to be a God of
judgment—even a God who, in strict account, <span
id="fr_4976"></span>[4977](#fn_4976) not only bestows honour, but also
takes away what a man seems to have. <span
id="fr_4977"></span>[4978](#fn_4977) Else, if it is the Creator whom He
has here delineated as the “austere man,” who “takes up what he laid not
down, and reaps what he did not sow,” <span
id="fr_4978"></span>[4979](#fn_4978) my instructor even here is He,
(whoever He may be,) to whom belongs the money He teaches me fruitfully
to expend. <span id="fr_4979"></span>[4980](#fn_4979)

<span id="v.iv.v.xxxvii-p4"></span> The older reading, which we here
follow, is: “Enimvero Zacchæus etsi allophylus fortasse,” etc.  Oehler,
however, points the passage thus: “Enimvero Zacchæus etsi allophylus,
fortasse,” etc., removing the doubt, and making Zacchæus “of another
race” than the Jewish, for certain. This is probably more than
Tertullian meant to say.
