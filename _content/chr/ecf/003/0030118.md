id="iv.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.iii-p2"></span>And how long shall we draw the saw to and
fro through this line, when we have an ancient practice, which by
anticipation has made for us the state, i.e., of the question? If no
passage of Scripture has prescribed it, assuredly custom, which without
doubt flowed from tradition, has confirmed it. For how can anything come
into use, if it has not first been handed down?  Even in pleading
tradition, written authority, you say, must be demanded. Let us inquire,
therefore, whether tradition, unless it be written, should not be
admitted. Certainly we shall say that it ought not to be admitted, if no
cases of other practices which, without any written instrument, we
maintain on the ground of tradition alone, and the countenance
thereafter of custom, affords us any precedent.  To deal with this
matter briefly, I shall begin with baptism. <span
id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386) When we are going to enter the water,
but a little before, in the presence of the congregation and under the
hand of the president, we solemnly profess that we disown the devil, and
his pomp, and his angels. Hereupon we are thrice immersed, making a
somewhat ampler pledge than the Lord has appointed in the Gospel. Then
when we are taken up (as new-born children), <span
id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387) we taste first of all a mixture of
milk and honey, and from that day we refrain from the daily bath for a
whole week. We take also, in congregations before daybreak, and from the
hand of none but the presidents, the sacrament of the Eucharist, which
the Lord both commanded to be eaten at meal-times, and enjoined to be
taken by all alike. <span id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388) As often as
the anniversary comes round, we make offerings for the dead as birthday
honours. We count fasting or kneeling in worship on the Lord’s day to be
unlawful. We rejoice in the same privilege also from Easter to
Whitsunday. We feel pained should any wine or bread, even though our
own, be cast upon the ground.  At every forward step and movement, at
every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we
bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on <span
id="page_95">p. 95</span> <span id="iv.vi.iii-Page_95"></span>seat, in
all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the
sign. <span id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389)
