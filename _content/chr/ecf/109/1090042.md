<span id="viii.ii-p4"></span>*Against those who improperly use the
apostolic declaration which says, “Whether in pretence, or in sincerity,
Christ is preached:*” ([Phil. i.
18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018)<span id="viii.ii-p4.1"></span>),
*and about humbleness of mind.*

id="viii.ii-p5.1"></span>Introduction.</span>

<span id="viii.ii-p6"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="viii.ii-p6.1"></span>There</span> is an allusion at the beginning of
this Homily to some remarks recently made on the parable of the Pharisee
and the Publican. These occur in Chrysostom’s fifth Homily against the
Anomœans, one of a set of Homilies which, from internal evidence, may be
assigned to the close of the year 386, or beginning of 387. The
following homily therefore was delivered at Antioch, probably just
before Christmas 386. There were some persons who explained the words of
St. Paul cited in the title as signifying that provided Christ was
preached it mattered not whether the actual doctrines taught were true
or heretical. The main object of the homily is to vindicate the language
of the Apostle from this erroneous and mischievous interpretation.
