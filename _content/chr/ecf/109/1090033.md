id="vi.ii-p1.1"></span>INTRODUCTION TO THE LETTER TO A YOUNG
WIDOW.</span>

<span id="vi.ii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="vi.ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> date of the following letter can be
determined within very narrow limits. It contains a reference (c. 5) to
the defeat and death of the Emperor Valens in the battle with the Goths
at Hadrianople, in <span class="c12"><span
id="vi.ii-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span> 378, as a recent event. The Emperor
who is described as having incessantly engaged in war ever since his
accession (c. 4) must be Theodosius, who succeeded Valens, and as the
Goths are said to be still overrunning large regions with impunity, and
insolently mocking the timidity of the imperial troops (ib.) the letter
must have been written prior to the crushing defeat which Theodosius
inflicted on them in 382. The whole epistle is deeply tinged with that
profound sense of the unhappiness and instability of human life which
the moral corruption of society and recent calamities of the empire
impressed with peculiar force on the minds of men; producing too often
amongst Pagans either a cynical gloom or reckless indifference, but
leading Christians to cling more closely and earnestly to the hopes and
consolations of the Gospel.
