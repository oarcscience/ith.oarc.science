<p class="c12"><a name="iii.iii.i-p5"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iii.iii.i-p5.1"></A>The</span> pre-eminence of Chrysostom as a preacher remains undisputed, despite the many reversals of judgment that have resulted from modern historical investigations; no voice has been raised against the popular verdict, repeated in every age, that awards to him the first place among pulpit orators in the Eastern Church.</p>  
<p class="c13"><a name="iii.iii.i-p6"></A>Nor has there been any serious difference of opinion in regard to his personal character. His intense moral earnestness has always been recognized, and the man has been honored because it was distinctly felt that the man gave power to the oration. &#8220;Golden mouth&#8221; avails little, unless it belongs to a golden man. The rhetorical training of his earlier years doubtless contributed much to his skill as a preacher, but his exegetical method was perhaps a still more important factor.</p>
