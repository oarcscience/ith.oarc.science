<p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.v.xix-p2"></A>We must not, however, omit to ask how it comes that Luke and John give the speech without the phrase &#8220;to stoop down.&#8221;&#160; He, perhaps, who stoops down may be held to unloose in the sense which we have stated.&#160; On the other hand, it may be that one who fixes his eyes on the height of the exaltation of the Logos, may find the loosing of those shoes which when one is seeking them seem to be bound, so that He also looses those shoes which are separable from the Logos, and beholds the Logos divested of inferior things, as He is, the Son of God.</p>
