<span id="xvi.ii.iv.i-p2"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv.i-p2.1"></span>1.  Introduction to the Feeding of the Five
Thousand.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iv.i-p3"></span>“*And when even was come His disciples
came to Him,*” <span id="fr_5336"></span>[5337](#fn_5336) that is, at
the consummation of the age in regard to which we may fitly say what is
found in the Epistle of John, “It is the last hour.” <span
id="fr_5337"></span>[5338](#fn_5337)   They, not yet understanding what
the Word was about to do, say to Him, “The place is desert,” <span
id="fr_5338"></span>[5339](#fn_5338) seeing the desert condition of the
masses in respect of God and the Law and the Word; but they say to Him,
“The time is past,” <span id="fr_5339"></span>[5340](#fn_5339) as if the
fitting season of the law and prophets had passed.  Perhaps they spoke
this saying, in reference to the word of Jesus, that because of the
beheading of John both the law and the prophets who were until John had
ceased. <span id="fr_5340"></span>[5341](#fn_5340)   “The time is past,”
therefore they say, and no food is at hand, because the season of it is
no longer present, that those who have followed Thee in the desert may
serve the law and the prophets.  And, further, the disciples say, “Send
them away,” <span id="fr_5341"></span>[5342](#fn_5341) that each one may
buy food, if he cannot from the cities, at least from the
villages,—places more ignoble.  Such things the disciples said, because,
after the letter of the law had been abrogated and prophecies had
ceased, they despaired of unexpected and new food being found for the
multitudes.  But see what Jesus answers to the disciples though He does
not cry out and plainly say it:  “You suppose that, if the great
multitude go away from Me in need of food, they will find it in villages
rather than with Me, and among bodies of men, not of citizens but of
villagers, rather than by abiding with Me.  But I declare unto you, that
in regard to that of which you suppose they are in need they are not in
need, for they have no need to go away; but in regard to that of which
you think they have no need—that is, of Me—as if I could not feed them,
of this contrary to your expectation they have need.  Since, then, I
have trained you, and made you fit to give rational food to them who are
in need of it, give ye to the crowds who have followed Me to eat; for ye
have the power, which ye have received from Me, of giving the multitudes
to eat; and if ye had attended to this, ye would have understood that I
am far more able to feed them, and ye would not have said, ‘Send the
multitudes away that they may go and buy food for themselves.’” <span
