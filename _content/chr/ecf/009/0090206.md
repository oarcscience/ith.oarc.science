<span id="xv.iii.i.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.x-p1.1"></span>10.  How Jesus Himself is the Gospel.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.x-p2"></span>The foregoing inquiry into the nature of
the Gospel cannot be regarded as useless; it has enabled us to see what
distinction there is between a sensible Gospel and an intellectual and
spiritual one.  What we have now to do is to transform the sensible
Gospel into a spiritual one.

<span id="xv.iii.i.x-p3"></span>For what would the narrative of the
sensible Gospel amount to if it were not developed to a spiritual one? 
It would be of little account or none; any one can read it and assure
himself of the facts it tells—no more.  But our whole energy is now to
be directed to the effort to penetrate to the deep things of the meaning
of the Gospel and to search out the truth that is in it when divested of
types.  Now what the Gospels say is to be regarded in the light of
promises of good things; and we must say that the good things the
Apostles announce in this Gospel are simply Jesus.  One good thing which
they are said to announce is the resurrection; but the resurrection is
in a manner Jesus, for Jesus says: <span
id="fr_4494"></span>[4495](#fn_4494)   “I am the resurrection.”  Jesus
preaches to the poor those things which are laid up for the saints,
calling them to the divine promises.  And the holy Scriptures bear
witness to the Gospel announcements made by the Apostles and to that
made by our Saviour.  David says of the Apostles, perhaps also of the
evangelists: <span id="fr_4495"></span>[4496](#fn_4495)   “The Lord
shall give the word to those that preach with great power; the King of
the powers of the beloved;” teaching at the same time that it is not
skilfully composed discourse, nor the mode of delivery, nor well
practised eloquence that produces conviction, but the communication of
divine power.  Hence also Paul says: <span
id="fr_4496"></span>[4497](#fn_4496)   “I will know not the word that is
puffed up, but the power; for the kingdom of God is not in word but in
power.”  And in another passage: <span
id="fr_4497"></span>[4498](#fn_4497)   “And my word and my preaching
were not persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit
and of power.”  To this power Simon and Cleophas bear witness when they
say: <span id="fr_4498"></span>[4499](#fn_4498)   “Was not our heart
burning within us by the way, as he opened to us the Scriptures?”  And
the Apostles, since the quantity of the power is great which God
supplies to the speakers, had great power, according to the word of
David:  “The Lord will give the word to the preachers with great
power.”  Isaiah too says: <span id="fr_4499"></span>[4500](#fn_4499)  
“How beautiful are the feet of them that proclaim good tidings;” he sees
how beautiful and how opportune was the announcement of the Apostles who
walked in Him who said, “I am the way,” and praises the feet of those
who walk in the intellectual way of Christ Jesus, and through that door
go in to God.  They announce good tidings, those whose feet are
beautiful, namely, Jesus.
