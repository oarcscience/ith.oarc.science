<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xx-p1.1"></span>20.  Christ and the Gentiles.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xx-p2"></span>Now there are those in whose case it
has happened that the man dwells with them without having hated them,
because they abide in the house of the last husband, who took to himself
their synagogue as wife.  But also in their case the latter husband
dies, <span id="fr_6200"></span>[6201](#fn_6200) perhaps whenever the
last enemy of Christ, death, is destroyed.  But whichever of these
things may happen, whether the former or the latter to the wife, the
former husband, it says, who sent her away, will not he able to turn
back and take her to be a wife to himself after she has been defiled,
since “it is abomination,” it says, “before the Lord thy God.” <span
id="fr_6201"></span>[6202](#fn_6201)   But these things will not seem to
be consistent with this, “If the fulness of the Gentiles be come in, all
Israel shall be saved.” <span id="fr_6202"></span>[6203](#fn_6202)   But
consider if it can be said to this, that, if she shall be saved by her
former husband returning and taking her to himself as wife, she will in
any case be saved after she has been polluted.  A priest, then, will not
take to himself as a wife one who has been a harlot and an
outcast, <span id="fr_6203"></span>[6204](#fn_6203) but no other, as
being inferior to the priest, is hindered from doing so.  But if you
seek for the harlot in regard to the calling of the Gentiles, you may
use the passage, “Take to yourself a wife of fornication, and children
of fornication,” <span id="fr_6204"></span>[6205](#fn_6204) etc.; for,
as “the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are
guiltless,” <span id="fr_6205"></span>[6206](#fn_6205) so he who,
casting out his former wife, takes in due season “a wife of
fornication,” having done it according to the command of Him who says,
when it is necessary, and so long as it was necessary, “He shall not
take a harlot to wife,” and, when it was reasonable, He says, “Take to
<span id="page_509">p. 509</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xx-Page_509"></span>yourself a wife of fornication.”  For
as the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath, <span
id="fr_6206"></span>[6207](#fn_6206) and not the slave of the sabbath as
the people are, so He who gives the law has power to give it “until a
time of reformation,” <span id="fr_6207"></span>[6208](#fn_6207) and to
change the law, and, when the time of the reformation is at hand, also
to give after the former way and after the former heart another way and
another heart, “in an acceptable time, and in a day of salvation.” <span
id="fr_6208"></span>[6209](#fn_6208)   And let these things be said
according to our interpretation of the law in regard to the bill of
divorcement.
