<span id="xv.iii.v.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.xxvi-p1.1"></span>26.  The Story of Israel Crossing Jordan
Under Joshua is Typical of Christian Things, and is Written for Our
Instruction.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xxvi-p2"></span>Now, it may very well be that some
one not versed in the various aspects of the Saviour may stumble at the
interpretation given above of the Jordan; because John says, “I baptize
with water, but He that cometh after me is stronger than I; He shall
baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”  To this we reply that, as the Word
of God in His character as something to be drunk is to one set of men
water, and to another wine, making glad the heart of man, and to others
blood, since it is said, <span id="fr_4930"></span>[4931](#fn_4930)
“Except ye drink My blood, ye have no life in you,” and as in His
character as food He is variously conceived as living bread or as flesh,
so also He, the same person, is baptism of water, and baptism of Holy
Spirit and of fire, and to some, also, of blood.  It is of His last
baptism, as some hold, that He speaks in the words, <span
id="fr_4931"></span>[4932](#fn_4931) “I have a baptism to be baptized
with, and how am I straitened till it be accomplished?”  And it agrees
with this that the disciple John speaks in his Epistle <span
id="fr_4932"></span>[4933](#fn_4932) of the Spirit, and the water, and
the blood, as being one.  And again He declares Himself to be the way
and the door, but clearly He is not the door to those to whom He is the
way, and He is no longer the way to those to whom He is the door.  All
those, then, who are being initiated in the beginning of the oracles of
God, and come to the voice of him who cries in the wilderness, “Make
straight the way of the Lord,” the voice which sounds beyond Jordan at
the house of preparation, let them prepare themselves so that they may
be in a state to receive the spiritual word, brought home to them by the
enlightenment of the Spirit.  As we are now, as our subject requires,
bringing together all that relates to the Jordan, let us look at the
“river.”  God, by Moses, carried the people through the Red Sea, making
the water a wall for them on the right hand and on the left, and by
Joshua He carried them through Jordan.  Now, Paul deals with this
Scripture, and his warfare is not according to the flesh of it, for he
knew that the law is spiritual in a spiritual sense.  And he shows us
that he understood what is said about the passage of the Red Sea; for he
says in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, <span
id="fr_4933"></span>[4934](#fn_4933) “I would not, brethren, have you
ignorant, how that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed
through the sea, and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in
the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and drink the same
spiritual drink; for they drank of the spiritual rock which followed
them, and the rock was Christ.”  In the spirit of this passage let us
also pray that we may receive from God to understand the spiritual
meaning of Joshua’s passage through Jordan.  Of it, also, Paul would
have said, “I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that all our
fathers went through Jordan, and were all baptized into Jesus in the
spirit and in the river.”  And Joshua, who succeeded Moses, was a type
of Jesus Christ, who succeeds the dispensation through the law, and
replaces it by the preaching of the Gospel.  And even if those Paul
speaks of were baptized in the cloud and in the sea, there is something
harsh and salt in their baptism.  They are still in fear of their
enemies, and crying to the Lord and to Moses, saying, <span
id="fr_4934"></span>[4935](#fn_4934) “Because there were no graves in
Egypt, hast thou brought us forth to slay us in the wilderness?  Why
hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?”  But the
baptism to Joshua, which takes place in quite sweet and drinkable water,
is in many ways superior to that earlier one, religion having by this
time grown clearer and assuming a becoming <span id="page_373">p.
373</span> <span id="xv.iii.v.xxvi-Page_373"></span>order.  For the ark
of the covenant of the Lord our God is carried in procession by the
priests and levites, the people following the ministers of God, it,
also, accepting the law of holiness.  For Joshua says to the
people, <span id="fr_4935"></span>[4936](#fn_4935) “Sanctify yourselves
against tomorrow; the Lord will do wonders among you.”  And he commands
the priests to go before the people with the ark of the covenant,
wherein is plainly showed forth the mystery of the Father’s economy
about the Son, which is highly exalted by Him who gave the Son this
office; “That at the name of Jesus <span
id="fr_4936"></span>[4937](#fn_4936) every knee should bow, of things in
heaven and things on earth and things under the earth, and that every
tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
Father.”  This is pointed out by what we find in the book called
Joshua, <span id="fr_4937"></span>[4938](#fn_4937) “In that day I will
begin to exalt thee before the children of Israel.”  And we hear our
Lord Jesus saying to the children of Israel, <span
id="fr_4938"></span>[4939](#fn_4938) “Come hither and hear the words of
the Lord your God.  Hereby ye shall know that the living God is in
(among) you;” for when we are baptized to Jesus, we know that the living
God is in us.  And, in the former case, they kept the passover in Egypt,
and then began their journey, but with Joshua, after crossing Jordan on
the tenth day of the first month they pitched their camp in Galgala; for
a sheep had to be procured before invitations could be issued to the
banquet after Joshua’s baptism.  Then the children of Israel, since the
children of those who came out of Egypt had not received circumcision,
were circumcised by Joshua with a very sharp stone; the Lord declares
that He takes away the reproach of Egypt on the day of Joshua’s baptism,
when Joshua purified the children of Israel.  For it is written: <span
id="fr_4939"></span>[4940](#fn_4939)   “And the Lord said to Joshua, the
son of Nun, This day have I taken away the reproach of Egypt from off
you.”  Then the children of Israel kept the passover on the fourteenth
day of the month, with much greater gladness than in Egypt, for they ate
unleavened bread of the corn of the holy land, and fresh food better
than manna.  For when they received the land of promise God did not
entertain them with scantier food, nor when such a one as Joshua was
their leader do they get inferior bread.  This will be plain to him who
thinks of the true holy land and of the Jerusalem above.  Hence it is
written in this same Gospel: <span id="fr_4940"></span>[4941](#fn_4940)
  Your fathers did eat bread in the wilderness, and are dead; he that
eateth of this bread shall live for ever.  For the manna, though it was
given by God, yet was bread of travel, bread supplied to those still
under discipline, well fitted for those who were under tutors and
governors.  And the new bread Joshua managed to get from corn they cut
in the country, in the land of promise, others having laboured and his
disciples reaping,—that was bread more full of life, distributed as it
was to those who, for their perfection, were able to receive the
inheritance of their fathers.  Hence, he who is still under discipline
to that bread may receive death as far as it is concerned, but he who
has attained to the bread that follows that, eating it, shall live for
ever.  All this has been added, not, I conceive, without
appropriateness, to our study of the baptism at the Jordan, administered
by John at Bethabara.
