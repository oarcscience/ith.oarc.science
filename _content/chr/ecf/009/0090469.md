<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xxviii-p1.1"></span>28.  Close Relationship of Angels to
Their “Little Ones.”</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxviii-p2"></span>With reference to the words,
“*When through the laver I became a child in Christ,*” <span
id="fr_5998"></span>[5999](#fn_5998) it may be said, that there is no
holy angel present with those who are still in wickedness, but that
during the period of unbelief they are under the angels of Satan; <span
id="fr_5999"></span>[6000](#fn_5999) but, after the regeneration, He who
has redeemed us with His own blood consigns us to a holy angel, who
also, because of his purity, beholds the face of God.  And a third
exposition of this passage might be something like the following, which
would say, that as it is possible for a man to change from unbelief to
faith, and from intemperance to temperance, and generally from
wickedness to virtue, so also it is possible that the angel, to whom any
soul has been entrusted at birth, may be wicked at the first, but
afterwards may at some time believe in proportion as the man believes,
and may make such advance that he may become one of the angels who
always behold the face of the Father in heaven, <span
id="fr_6000"></span>[6001](#fn_6000) beginning from the time that he is
yoked along with the man who was foreknown and foreordained to believe
at that time, the judgments of God, which are unspeakable and
unsearchable and like to the depths, fitly bringing together all this
harmonious relationship—angels with men.  And it may be that as when a
man and his wife are both unbelievers, sometimes it is the man who first
believes and in time saves his wife, and sometimes the wife who begins
and afterwards in time persuades her husband, so it happens with angels
and with men.  If, however, anything of this kind takes place in the
case of other angels or not, you may seek out for yourself.  But
consider whether it may not be appropriate to say something of this kind
in regard to each angel who is so honoured according to the word of the
Saviour, that he is said to behold always the face of the Father who is
in heaven.  But since in what we said above, that the little ones have
angels, but that the great have passed beyond such a position, some one
will quote in opposition to us from the Acts of the Apostles, where it
is written, that a certain maid Rhoda, when Peter knocked at the door,
came to answer, and recognizing the voice of Peter, ran in and announced
that Peter stood before the gate; but when they who were gathered
together in the house wondered, and thought that it was quite impossible
that Peter verily stood before the gate, they said, It is his
angel. <span id="fr_6001"></span>[6002](#fn_6001)   For the objector
will say that, as they had learned once for all that each of the
believers had some definite angel, they knew that Peter also had one. 
But he, who adheres to what we have previously said, will say that the
word of Rhoda was not necessarily a dogma, and perhaps also the word of
those who did not accurately know, when one as being little and
God-fearing is governed by angels, and when now by the Lord Himself. 
After this, in order to establish our conception of the little one which
we have brought forward, it will be said that we need no command about
“not despising” in the case of the great, but we do need it in the case
of the little; wherefore it is not merely said, “Do not despise one of
these,” pointing to all the disciples, but “one of these little
ones,” <span id="fr_6002"></span>[6003](#fn_6002) pointed out by Him,
who sees the littleness and the greatness of the soul.
