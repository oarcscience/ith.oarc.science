id="xii.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—We Shall Be Judged in the
Flesh.</span>

<span id="xii.vi.ix-p2"></span>And let no one of you say that this very
flesh shall not be judged, nor rise again.  Consider ye in what
\[state\] ye were saved, in what ye received sight, <span
id="fr_4377"></span>[4378](#fn_4377) if not while ye were in this
flesh.  We must therefore preserve the flesh as the temple of God.  For
as ye were called in the flesh, ye shall also come \[to be judged\] in
the flesh.  As Christ <span id="fr_4378"></span>[4379](#fn_4378) the
Lord who saved us, though He was first a Spirit <span
id="fr_4379"></span>[4380](#fn_4379) became flesh, and thus called us,
so shall we also receive the reward in this flesh.  Let us therefore
love one another, that we may all attain to the kingdom of God.  While
we have an opportunity of being healed, let us yield ourselves to God
that healeth us, and give to Him a recompense.  Of what sort? 
Repentance out of a sincere heart; for He knows all things beforehand,
and is acquainted with what is in our hearts.  Let us therefore give Him
praise, not with the mouth only, but also with the heart, that He may
accept us as sons.  For the Lord has said, “Those are my brethren who do
the will of my Father.” <span id="fr_4380"></span>[4381](#fn_4380)
