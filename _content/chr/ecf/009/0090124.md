<span id="xii.iv.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—Let Us Also Draw Near to God
in Purity of Heart.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xxix-p2"></span>Let us then draw near to Him with
holiness of spirit, lifting up pure and undefiled hands unto Him, loving
our gracious and merciful Father, who has made us partakers in the
blessings of His elect. <span id="fr_4137"></span>[4138](#fn_4137)   For
thus it is written, “When the Most High divided the nations, when He
scattered <span id="fr_4138"></span>[4139](#fn_4138) the sons of Adam,
He fixed the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels
of God.  His people Jacob became the portion of the Lord, and Israel the
lot of His inheritance. <span id="fr_4139"></span>[4140](#fn_4139)   And
in another place \[the Scripture\] saith, <span id="page_238">p.
238</span> <span id="xii.iv.xxix-Page_238"></span>“Behold, the Lord
taketh unto Himself a nation out of the midst of the nations, as a man
takes the first-fruits of his threshing-floor; and from that nation
shall come forth the Most Holy.” <span
