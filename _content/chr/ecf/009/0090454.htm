<p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.xiii-p2"></A>Moreover to the saying, &#8220;They that received the half-shekel came to Peter,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5913"></A><A HREF="#fn_5913"><FONT SIZE="1">5914</FONT></A>
 you will adduce from Numbers that, for the saints according to the law of God, is paid not a half-shekel simply, but a sacred half-shekel.&#160; For it is written, &#8220;And thou shalt take five shekels per head, according to the sacred half-shekel.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5914"></A><A HREF="#fn_5914"><FONT SIZE="1">5915</FONT></A>
&#160; But also on behalf of all the sons of Israel is given a sacred half-shekel per head.&#160; Since then it was not possible for the saint of God to possess along with the sacred half-shekels the profane shekels, so to speak, on this account, to them who do not receive the sacred half-shekels, and who asked Peter and said, &#8220;Doth not your master pay the half-shekel?&#8221; the Saviour commands the stater to be paid, in which was the half-shekel which was found in the mouth of the first fish that came up, in order that it might be given for the Teacher and the disciple.</p>
