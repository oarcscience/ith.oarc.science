<p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.iii.xxiv-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.iii.xxiv-p1.1"></A>24.&#160; The Diverse Forms of Spiritual Sickness.</span></p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.iii.xxiv-p2"></A>And, if you wish to see of what nature are the sicknesses of the soul, contemplate with me the lovers of money, and the lovers of ambition, and the lovers of boys, and if any be fond of women; for these also beholding among the crowds and taking compassion upon them, He healed.&#160; For not every sin is to be considered a sickness, but that which has settled down in the whole soul.&#160; For so you may see the lovers of money wholly intent on money and upon preserving and gathering it, the lovers of ambition wholly intent on a little glory, for they gape for praise from the masses and the vulgar; and analogously you will understand in the case of the rest which we have named, and if there be any other like to them.&#160; Since, then, when expounding the words, &#8220;He healed their sick,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5329"></A><A HREF="#fn_5329"><FONT SIZE="1">5330</FONT></A>
 we said that not every sin is a sickness, it is fitting to discuss from the Scripture the difference of these.&#160; The Apostle indeed says, writing to the Corinthians who had diverse sicknesses, &#8220;For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5330"></A><A HREF="#fn_5330"><FONT SIZE="1">5331</FONT></A>
&#160; Hear Him in these words, knitting a band and making it plaited of different sins, according as some are weak, and others sickly more than weak, and others, in comparison with both, are asleep.&#160; For some, because of impotence of soul, having a tendency to slip into any sin whatever, although they may not be wholly in the grasp of any form of sin, as the sickly are, are only weak; but others who, instead of loving God &#8220;with all their soul and all their heart and all their mind,&#8221; love money, or a little glory, or wife, or children, are suffering from something worse than weakness, and are sickly.&#160; And those who sleep are those who, when they ought to be taking heed and watching with the soul, are not doing this, but by reason of great want of attention are nodding in resolution and are drowsy in their reflections, such as &#8220;in their dreamings defile the flesh, and set at naught that which is highest in authority, and rail at dignities.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5331"></A><A HREF="#fn_5331"><FONT SIZE="1">5332</FONT></A>
&#160; And these, because they are asleep, live in an atmosphere of vain and dream-like fancies concerning realities, not admitting the things which are actually true, but deceived by what appears in their vain imaginations, in regard to whom it is said in Isaiah, &#8220;Like as when a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking, but when he has risen up is still thirsty, and his soul has cherished a vain hope, so shall be the wealth of all the nations as many as have warred in Jerusalem.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5332"></A><A HREF="#fn_5332"><FONT SIZE="1">5333</FONT></A>
&#160; If, then, we have seemed to make a digression in recounting the difference between the weak and the sickly and those that sleep, because of that which the Apostle said in the letter to the Corinthians which we have expounded, we have made the digression in our desire to represent what is meant to be understood by the saying, &#8220;And He healed their sick.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5333"></A><A HREF="#fn_5333"><FONT SIZE="1">5334</FONT></A>
