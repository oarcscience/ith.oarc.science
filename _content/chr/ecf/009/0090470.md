<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxix-Page_492"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xxix-p1.1"></span>29.  The Little Ones and the
Perfect.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxix-p2"></span>But another might say that the
perfect man is here called little, applying the word, “For he that is
least among you all, the same is great,” <span
id="fr_6003"></span>[6004](#fn_6003) and will affirm that he who humbles
himself and becomes a child in the midst of all that believe, though he
be an apostle or a bishop, and becomes such “as when a nurse cherisheth
her own children,” <span id="fr_6004"></span>[6005](#fn_6004) is the
little one pointed out by Jesus, and that the angel of such an one is
worthy to behold the face of God.  For to say that the little are here
called perfect, according to the passage, “He that is least among you
all, the same is great,” <span id="fr_6005"></span>[6006](#fn_6005) and
as Paul said, “Unto me who am less than the least of all saints was this
grace given,” <span id="fr_6006"></span>[6007](#fn_6006) will seem to be
in harmony with the saying, “Whoso shall cause one of these little ones
to stumble,” <span id="fr_6007"></span>[6008](#fn_6007) and “So it is
not the will of My Father in heaven, that one of these little ones
should perish.” <span id="fr_6008"></span>[6009](#fn_6008)   For he, as
has been stated, who is now little, could not be made to stumble nor
perish, for “great peace have they who love the law of God, and there is
no stumbling-block to them;” <span id="fr_6009"></span>[6010](#fn_6009)
and he could not perish, who is least of all among all the disciples of
Christ, and on this account becomes great; and, since he could not
perish, he could say, “Who shall separate us from the love,” <span
id="fr_6010"></span>[6011](#fn_6010) etc.  But he who wishes to maintain
this last exposition will say that the soul even of the just man is
changeable, as Ezekiel also testifies, saying, that the righteous man
may abandon the commandments of God, so that his former righteousness is
not reckoned unto him; <span id="fr_6011"></span>[6012](#fn_6011)
wherefore it is said, “Whoso shall cause to stumble one of these little
ones, <span id="fr_6012"></span>[6013](#fn_6012) and, “It is not the
will of My Father which is in heaven that one of these little ones
should perish.” <span id="fr_6013"></span>[6014](#fn_6013)

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxix-p14"></span>\[As for the exposition of the
matters relating to “the hundred sheep,” you may consult the homilies on
Luke. <span id="fr_6014"></span>[6015](#fn_6014) \]
