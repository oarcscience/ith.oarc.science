<span id="xii.iv.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIII.—Moses of Old Stilled the
Contention Which Arose Concerning the Priestly Dignity.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xliii-p2"></span>And what wonder is it if those in
Christ who were entrusted with such a duty by God, appointed those
\[ministers\] before mentioned, when the blessed Moses also, “a faithful
servant in all his house,” <span id="fr_4228"></span>[4229](#fn_4228)
noted down in the sacred books all the injunctions which were given him,
and when the other prophets also followed him, bearing witness with one
consent to the ordinances which he had appointed?  For, when rivalry
arose concerning the priesthood, and the tribes were contending among
themselves as to which of them should be adorned with that glorious
title, he commanded the twelve princes of the tribes to bring him their
rods, each one being inscribed with the name <span
id="fr_4229"></span>[4230](#fn_4229) of the tribe.  And he took them and
bound them \[together\], and sealed them with the rings of the princes
of the tribes, and laid them up in the tabernacle of witness on the
table of God.  And having shut the doors of the tabernacle, he sealed
the keys, as he had done the rods, and said to them, Men and brethren,
the tribe whose rod shall blossom has God chosen to fulfil the office of
the priesthood, and to minister unto Him.  And when the morning was
come, he assembled all Israel, six hundred thousand men, and showed the
seals to the princes of the tribes, and opened the tabernacle of
witness, and brought forth the rods.  And the rod of Aaron was found not
only to have blossomed, but to bear fruit upon it. <span
id="fr_4230"></span>[4231](#fn_4230)   What think ye, beloved?  Did not
Moses know beforehand that this would happen?  Undoubtedly he knew; but
he acted thus, that there might be no sedition in Israel, and that the
name of the true and only God might be glorified; to whom be glory for
ever and ever.  Amen.
