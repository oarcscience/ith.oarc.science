<span id="xv.iii.i.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xx-p1.1"></span>20.  (5) of Elements and What is Formed
from Them.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xx-p2"></span>There is also an arche in a matter of
learning, as when we say that the letters are the arche of grammar.  The
Apostle accordingly says: <span id="fr_4541"></span>[4542](#fn_4541)  
“When by reason of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need
again that some one teach you what are the elements of the arche of the
oracles of God.”  Now the arche spoken of in connection with learning is
twofold; first in respect of its nature, secondly in its relation to us;
as we might say of Christ, that by nature His arche is deity, but that
in relation to us who cannot, for its very greatness, command the whole
truth about Him, His arche is His manhood, as He is preached to babes,
“Jesus Christ and Him crucified.”  In this view, then, Christ is the
arche of learning in His own nature, because He is the wisdom and power
of God; but for us, the Word was made flesh, that He might tabernacle
among us who could only thus at first receive Him.  And perhaps this is
the reason why He is not only the firstborn of all creation, but is also
designated the man, Adam.  For Paul says He is Adam: <span
id="fr_4542"></span>[4543](#fn_4542)   “The last Adam was made a
life-giving spirit.”
