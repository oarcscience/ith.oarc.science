<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xx"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xx-p1.1"></span>20.  The World and Offences.  Various
Meanings of World.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xx-p2"></span>“*Woe unto the world because of
occasions of stumbling.*” <span id="fr_5945"></span>[5946](#fn_5945)  
The expression “cosmos,” is used in itself and absolutely in the
passage, “He was in the cosmos and the cosmos knew Him not,” <span
id="fr_5946"></span>[5947](#fn_5946) but it is used relatively and in
respect of its connection with that of which it is the cosmos, in the
words, “Lest you look up to the heaven, and seeing the sun, and the
moon, and all the cosmos of the heavens, you should stray and bow down
to them and worship them.” <span id="fr_5947"></span>[5948](#fn_5947)  
And the like you will find in the Book of Esther, spoken about her, when
it is written, stripping off all her “cosmos.” <span
id="fr_5948"></span>[5949](#fn_5948)   For the word “cosmos,” simply, is
not the same as the “cosmos” of heaven, or the “cosmos” of Esther; and
this which we are now investigating is another.  I think, then, that the
world is not this compacted whole of heaven and earth according to the
Divine Scriptures, but only the place which is round about the earth,
and this is not to be conceived in respect of the whole earth, but only
in respect of ours which is inhabited; for the true light “was in the
world,” that is, in the place which is around, conceived in relation to
our part of the earth; “and the world knew Him not,” <span
id="fr_5949"></span>[5950](#fn_5949) that is, the men in the region
round about, and perhaps also the powers that have an affinity to this
place.  For it is monstrous to understand by the world here the
compacted whole formed of heaven and earth, and those in it; so that it
could be said, that the sun and moon and the choir of the stars and the
angels in all this world, did not know the true light, and, though
ignorant of it, preserved the order which God had appointed for them. 
But when it is said by the Saviour in the prayer to the Father, “And,
now, glorify me, O Father, with Thine own self, with the glory which I
had with Thee before the world was,” <span
id="fr_5950"></span>[5951](#fn_5950) you must understand by the “world,”
that which is inhabited by us on the earth; for it was from this world
that the Father gave men to the Son, in regard to whom alone the Saviour
beseeches His Father, and not for the whole world of men.  Moreover,
also, when the Saviour says, “And I come to thee and am no longer in the
world,” <span id="fr_5951"></span>[5952](#fn_5951) He speaks of the
terrestrial world; for it is not to be supposed that He spoke things
contradictory when He said, “And I come to thee, and I am no longer in
the world,” and “I am in the world.”  But also in this, “And these
things I speak in the world,” <span id="fr_5952"></span>[5953](#fn_5952)
we must think of the place round about the earth.  And this is clearly
indicated also by the words, “And the world hated them, because they are
not of the world.” <span id="fr_5953"></span>[5954](#fn_5953)   For it
hated us from the time when we no longer “look at the things which are
seen, but at the things which are not seen,” <span
id="fr_5954"></span>[5955](#fn_5954) because of the teaching of Jesus;
not the world of heaven and earth and them that are therein, all
compacted together but the men on the earth along with us.  And the
saying, “They are not of the world,” <span
id="fr_5955"></span>[5956](#fn_5955) is equivalent to, They are not of
the place round about the earth.  And so also the disciples of Jesus are
not of this world, as He was not of the world.  And further also the
saying, “That the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me,” <span
id="fr_5956"></span>[5957](#fn_5956) twice spoken in the Gospel
according to John, does not refer to the things that are superior to
men, but to men who need to believe that the Father sent the Son into
the world here.  Yea, and also in the Apostle, “Your faith is proclaimed
in the whole world.” <span id="fr_5957"></span>[5958](#fn_5957)
