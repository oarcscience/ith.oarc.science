<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>25.  The Eye or Hand Allegorized.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxv-p2"></span>And it is possible to apply these
words also to our nearest kinsfolk, who are our members, as it were;
being considered to be our members, because of the close relationship;
whether by birth, or from any habitual friendship, so to speak; whom we
must not spare if they are injuring our soul.  For let us cut off from
ourselves as a hand or a foot or an eye, a father or mother who wishes
us to do that which is contrary to piety, and a son or daughter who, as
far as in them lies, would have us revolt from the church of Christ and
the love of Him.  But even if the wife of our bosom, or a friend who is
kindred in soul, become stumbling-blocks to us, let us not spare them,
but let us cut them out from ourselves, and cast them outside of our
soul, as not being truly our kindred but enemies of our salvation; for
“whosoever hates not his father, and mother,” <span
id="fr_5972"></span>[5973](#fn_5972) and the others subjoined, when it
is the fitting season to hate them as enemies and assailants, that he
may be able to win Christ, this man is not worthy of the Son of God. 
And in respect of these we may say, that from a critical position any
lame one, so to speak, is saved, when he has lost a foot—say a
brother—and alone obtains the inheritance of the kingdom of God; and a
maimed one is saved, when his father is not saved, but they perish,
while he is separated from them, that he alone may obtain the
benedictions.  And so also any one is saved with one eye, who <span
id="page_490">p. 490</span> <span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxv-Page_490"></span>has
cut out the eye of his own house, his wife, if she commit fornication,
lest having two eyes he may go away into the hell of fire.
