<span id="xv.iii.i.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xiii-p1.1"></span>13.  The Angels Also are
Evangelists.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xiii-p2"></span>Now if there are those among men who
are honoured with the ministry of evangelists, and if Jesus Himself
brings tidings of good things, and preaches the Gospel to the poor,
surely those messengers who were made spirits by God, <span
id="fr_4517"></span>[4518](#fn_4517) those who are a flame of fire,
ministers of the Father of all, cannot have been excluded from being
evangelists also.  Hence an angel standing over the shepherds made a
bright light to shine round about them, and said: <span
id="fr_4518"></span>[4519](#fn_4518)   “Fear not; behold I bring you
good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all the people; for there
is born to you, this day, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, in the city
of David.”  And at a time when there was no knowledge among men of the
mystery of the Gospel, those who were greater than men and inhabitants
of heaven, the army of God, praised God, saying, “Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace, good will among men.” <span
id="fr_4519"></span>[4520](#fn_4519)   And having said this, the angels
go away from the shepherds into heaven, leaving us to gather how the joy
preached to us through the birth of Jesus Christ is glory in the highest
to God; they humbled themselves even to the ground, and then returned to
their place of rest, to glorify God in the highest through Jesus
Christ.  But the angels also wonder at the peace which is to be brought
about on account of Jesus on the earth, that seat of war, on which
Lucifer, star of the morning, fell from heaven, to be warred against and
destroyed by Jesus.
