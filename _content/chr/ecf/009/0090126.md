<span id="xii.iv.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—Let Us See by What Means We
May Obtain the Divine Blessing.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xxxi-p2"></span>Let us cleave then to His blessing, and
consider what are the means <span id="fr_4148"></span>[4149](#fn_4148)
of possessing it.  Let us think <span
id="fr_4149"></span>[4150](#fn_4149) over the things which have taken
place from the beginning.  For what reason was our father Abraham
blessed?  Was it not because he wrought righteousness and truth through
faith?  Isaac, <span id="fr_4150"></span>[4151](#fn_4150) with perfect
confidence, as if knowing what was to happen, <span
id="fr_4151"></span>[4152](#fn_4151) cheerfully yielded himself as a
sacrifice. <span id="fr_4152"></span>[4153](#fn_4152)   Jacob, through
reason <span id="fr_4153"></span>[4154](#fn_4153) of his brother, went
forth with humility from his own land, and came to Laban and served him;
and there was given to him the sceptre of the twelve tribes of Israel.
