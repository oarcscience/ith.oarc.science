<span id="xv.iii.ii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.xvi-p1.1"></span>16.  The Life May Be the Light of Others
Besides.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.xvi-p2"></span>Let us suggest another question,
namely, whether the life was the light of men only, and not of every
being as well that is in blessedness.  For if the life were the same
thing as the light of men, and if the light of Christ were for men
alone, then the life also would be only for men.  But such a view is
both foolish and impious, since the other Scriptures testify against
this interpretation and declare that, when we are somewhat more
advanced, we shall be equal to the angels. <span
id="fr_4714"></span>[4715](#fn_4714)   The question is to be solved on
the principle that when a predicate is applied to certain persons, it is
not to be at once taken to apply to them alone.  Thus, when the light of
men is spoken of, it is not the light of men only; had that been the
meaning, a word would have been added to express it; the life, it would
have read, was the light of men only.  For it is possible for the light
of men to be the light of others besides men, just as it is possible
that certain animals and certain plants may form the food of men, and
that the same animals and plants should be the food of other creatures
too.  That is an example from common life; it is fitting that another
analogy should be adduced from the inspired books.  Now the question
here <span id="page_336">p. 336</span> <span
id="xv.iii.ii.xvi-Page_336"></span>before us, is why the light of men
should not be the light of other creatures also, and we have seen that
to speak of the light of men by no means excludes the possibility that
the light may be that of other beings besides man, whether inferior to
him or like him.  Now a name is given to God; He is said to be the God
of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.  He, then, who infers from the
saying, “The life was the light of men,” that the light is for no other
than for men, ought also to conclude that the God of Abraham and the God
of Isaac and the God of Jacob is the God of no one else but these three
patriarchs.  But He is also the God of Elijah, <span
id="fr_4715"></span>[4716](#fn_4715) and, as Judith says, <span
id="fr_4716"></span>[4717](#fn_4716) of her father Simeon, and the God
of the Hebrews.  By analogy of reasoning, then, if nothing prevents Him
from being the God of others, nothing prevents the light of men from
being the light of others besides men.
