<span id="xii.iv.xlvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVII.—Your Recent Discord is
Worse Than the Former Which Took Place in the Times of Paul.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xlvii-p2"></span>Take up the epistle of the blessed
Apostle Paul.  What did he write to you at the time when the gospel
first began to be preached? <span id="fr_4254"></span>[4255](#fn_4254)  
Truly, under the inspiration <span id="fr_4255"></span>[4256](#fn_4255)
of the Spirit, he wrote to you concerning himself, and Cephas, and
Apollos, <span id="fr_4256"></span>[4257](#fn_4256) because even then
parties <span id="fr_4257"></span>[4258](#fn_4257) had been formed among
you.  But that inclination for one above another entailed less guilt
upon you, inasmuch as your partialities were then shown towards
apostles, already of high reputation, and towards a man whom they had
approved.  But now reflect who those are that have perverted you, and
lessened the renown of your far-famed brotherly love.  It is
disgraceful, beloved, yea, highly disgraceful, and unworthy of your
Christian profession, <span id="fr_4258"></span>[4259](#fn_4258) that
such a thing should be heard of as that the most stedfast and ancient
church of the Corinthians should, on account of one or two persons,
engage in sedition against its presbyters.  And this rumour has reached
not only us, but those also who are unconnected <span
id="fr_4259"></span>[4260](#fn_4259) with us; so that, through your
infatuation, the name of the Lord is blasphemed, while danger is also
brought upon yourselves.
