<span id="xvi.ii.iv.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>16.  Concerning the Canaanitish Woman. 
Meaning of the “Borders of Tyre and Sidon.”</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iv.xvi-p2"></span>“*And Jesus went out thence and
withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.  And behold a Canaanitish
woman.*” <span id="fr_5486"></span>[5487](#fn_5486)   Whence the
“thence”?  Was it from the land of Gennesaret, concerning which it was
said before, “And when they had crossed over they came into the land of
Gennesaret?” <span id="fr_5487"></span>[5488](#fn_5487)   But He
withdrew, perhaps because the Pharisees were offended when they heard
that “not that which entereth in, but that which proceedeth out,
defileth the man;” <span id="fr_5488"></span>[5489](#fn_5488) and that,
because of their being suspected of plotting against Him, it is said,
“He withdrew,” is manifest from the passage, “And when He heard that
John was delivered up He withdrew into Galilee.” <span
id="fr_5489"></span>[5490](#fn_5489)   Perhaps also on this account,
when describing the things in this place, Mark says that “He rose up and
went into the borders of Tyre, and having entered into the house wished
no man to know it.” <span id="fr_5490"></span>[5491](#fn_5490)   It is
probable that He sought to avoid the Pharisees who were offended at His
teaching, waiting for the time for His suffering, which was more fitting
and rightly appointed.  But some one might say that Tyre and Sidon are
used for the Gentiles; accordingly when He withdrew from Israel He came
into the parts of the Gentiles.  Among the Hebrews, then, Tyre is called
Sor, and it is interpreted “anguish.”  Sidon, which is also the Hebrew
name, is rendered “hunters.”  And among the Gentiles likewise the
hunters are the evil powers, and among them is great distress, the
distress, namely, which exists in wickedness and passions.  When Jesus,
then, went out from Gennesaret He withdrew indeed from Israel and came,
not to Tyre and Sidon, but into “the parts” of Tyre and Sidon, with the
result that those of the Gentiles now believe in part; so that if He had
visited the whole of Tyre and Sidon, no unbeliever would have been left
in it.  <span id="page_445">p. 445</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iv.xvi-Page_445"></span>Now, according to Mark, “Jesus rose
up and went into the borders of Tyre,” <span
id="fr_5491"></span>[5492](#fn_5491) —that is, the distress of the
Gentiles,—in order that they also from these borders who believe can be
saved, when they come out of them; for attend to this:  “And behold a
Canaanitish woman came out from these borders and cried saying, Have
mercy on me, O Lord, Thou Son of David, my daughter is terribly vexed
with a demon.” <span id="fr_5492"></span>[5493](#fn_5492)   And I think
that if she had not come out from those borders she would not have been
able to cry to Jesus with the great faith to which testimony was borne;
and according to the proportion of faith one comes out from the borders
among the Gentiles, which “when the Most High divided the nations He set
up according to the number of the sons of Israel,” <span
id="fr_5493"></span>[5494](#fn_5493) and prevented their further
advance.  Here, then, certain borders are spoken of as the borders of
Tyre and Sidon, but in Exodus the borders of Pharaoh, <span
id="fr_5494"></span>[5495](#fn_5494) in which, they say, were formed the
plagues against the Egyptians.  And we must suppose that each of us when
he sins is in the borders of Tyre or Sidon or of Pharaoh and Egypt, or
some one of those which are outside the allotted inheritance of God; but
when he changes from wickedness to virtue he goes out from the borders
of evil, and comes to the borders of the portion of God, there being
among these also a difference which will be manifest to those who are
able to understand the things that concern the division and the
inheritance of Israel, in harmony with the spiritual law.  And attend
also to the meeting, so to speak, which took place between Jesus and the
Canaanitish woman; for He comes as to the parts of Tyre and Sidon, and
she comes out of those parts, and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, O
Lord, Thou Son of David.” <span id="fr_5495"></span>[5496](#fn_5495)  
Now the woman was Canaanitish, which is rendered, prepared for
humiliation.  The righteous, indeed, are prepared for the kingdom of
heaven and for the exaltation in the kingdom of God; <span
id="fr_5496"></span>[5497](#fn_5496) but sinners are prepared for the
humiliation of the wickedness which is in them, and of the deeds which
flow from it and prepare them for it, and of the sin which reigns in
their mortal body.  Only, the Canaanitish woman came out of those
borders and went forth from the state of being prepared for humiliation,
crying and saying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Thou Son of David.”
