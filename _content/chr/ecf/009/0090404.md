<span id="xvi.ii.v.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.vii-p1.1"></span>7.  Relative Magnitude of Sins of the
Heart and Actual Sins.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.vii-p2"></span>But we may also learn from this, that
in respect of the reasonings only which we reason within ourselves, we
are sometimes convicted and reproached as being of little faith.  And I
think that just as a man commits adultery in his heart only, though not
proceeding altogether to the overt act, so he commits in his heart the
rest of the things which are forbidden.  As then he who has committed
adultery in his heart will be punished proportionately to adultery of
this kind, so also he who has done in his heart any one of the things
forbidden, for example, who has stolen in his heart only, or borne false
witness in his heart only, will not be punished as he who has stolen in
fact, or who has completed the very act of false testimony, but only as
he who has done such things in his heart.  There is also the case of the
man who while he did not arrive at the evil action, came short of it in
spite of his own will.  For if, in addition to willing it, he has
attempted it, but not carried it out, he will be punished not as one who
has sinned in his heart alone but in deed.  To questions of this sort
one might ask, whether any one commits adultery in his heart, even if he
does not do the deed of adultery, but lacks self-control in heart only. 
And the like also you will say concerning the rest of things which are
deserving of praise.  But the passage possibly contains a plausible
fallacy which must be cleared away, I think, in this manner:  adultery
which takes place in the heart is a less sin, than if one were also to
add to it the act.  But it is impossible that there can be chastity in
the heart, hindering the chaste action—unless indeed one brings forward
for an illustration of this the case of the virgin who according to the
law was violated in solitude; <span id="fr_5600"></span>[5601](#fn_5600)
for it may be granted that the heart of any one may be most pure, <span
id="fr_5601"></span>[5602](#fn_5601) but that force in a matter of
licentiousness has caused the corruption of the body of her who was
chaste.  In truth she seems to me to be altogether chaste in secret
heart, but no longer to be pure in body such as she was before the act
of violence; but though she is not pure outwardly, is she therefore now
also unchaste?  I have said these things because of the words, “They
reasoned among themselves saying, We took no loaves,” to which is added,
“And Jesus perceiving it, said, O ye of little faith, why reason ye
among yourselves,” <span id="fr_5602"></span>[5603](#fn_5602) etc.; for
it was necessary that investigation should be made in regard to the
censure of things in secret and correlatively to the praise of things in
secret.
