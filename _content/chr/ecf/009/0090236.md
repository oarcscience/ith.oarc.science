<span id="xv.iii.i.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xl-p1.1"></span>40.  Christ as Righteousness; As the
Demiurge, the Agent of the Good God, and as High-Priest.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xl-p2"></span>Having expiscated the “to us” and the
“absolutely”—sanctification and redemption being “to us” and not
absolute, wisdom and redemption both to us and absolute—we must not omit
to enquire into the position of righteousness in the same passage.  That
Christ is righteousness relatively to us appears clearly from the
words:  “Who was made to us of God wisdom and righteousness and
sanctification and redemption.”  And if we do not find Him to be
righteousness absolutely as He is the wisdom and the power of God
absolutely, then we must enquire whether to Christ Himself, as the
Father is sanctification, so the Father is also righteousness.  There
is, we know, no unrighteousness with God; <span
id="fr_4635"></span>[4636](#fn_4635) He is a righteous and holy
Lord, <span id="fr_4636"></span>[4637](#fn_4636) and His judgments are
in righteousness, and being righteous, He orders all things righteously.

<span id="xv.iii.i.xl-p5"></span>The heretics drew a distinction for
purposes of their own between the just and the good.  They did not make
the matter very clear, but they considered that the demiurge was just,
while the Father of Christ was good.  That distinction may, I think, if
carefully examined, be applied to the Father and the Son; the Son being
righteousness, and having received power <span
id="fr_4637"></span>[4638](#fn_4637) to execute judgment, because He is
the Son of Man and will judge the world in righteousness, but the Father
doing good to those who have been disciplined by the righteousness of
the Son.  This is after the kingdom of the Son; then the Father will
manifest in His works His name the Good, when God becomes all in all. 
And perhaps by His righteousness the Saviour prepares everything at the
fit times, and by His word, by His ordering, by His chastisements, and,
if I may use such an expression, by His spiritual healing aids, disposes
all things to receive at the end the goodness of the Father.  It was
from His sense of that goodness that He answered him who addressed the
Only-begotten with the words “Good Master,” <span
id="fr_4638"></span>[4639](#fn_4638) and said, “Why callest thou Me
good?  None is good but one, God, the Father.”  This we have treated of
elsewhere, especially in dealing with the question of the greater than
the demiurge; Christ we have taken to be the demiurge, and the Father
the greater than He.  Such great things, then, He is, the Paraclete, the
atonement, the propitiation, the sympathizer with our weaknesses, who
was tempted in all human things, as we are, without sin; and in
consequence He is a great High-Priest, having offered Himself as the
sacrifice which is offered once for all, and not for men only but for
every rational creature.  For without <span
id="fr_4639"></span>[4640](#fn_4639) God He tasted death for every one. 
In some copies of the Epistle to the Hebrews the words are “by the grace
of God.”  Now, whether He tasted death for every one without God, He
died not for men only but for all other intellectual beings too, or
whether He tasted death for every one by the grace of God, He died for
all without <span id="page_319">p. 319</span> <span
id="xv.iii.i.xl-Page_319"></span>God, for by the grace of God He tasted
death for every one.  It would surely be absurd to say that He tasted
death for human sins and not for any other being besides man which had
fallen into sin, as for example for the stars.  For not even the stars
are clean in the eyes of God, as we read in Job, <span
id="fr_4640"></span>[4641](#fn_4640) “The stars are not clean in His
sight,” unless this is to be regarded as a hyperbole.  Hence he is a
great High-Priest, since He restores all things to His Father’s kingdom,
and arranges that whatever defects exist in each part of creation shall
be filled up so as to be full of the glory of the Father.  This
High-Priest is called, from some other notion of him than those we have
noticed, Judas, that those who are Jews secretly <span
id="fr_4641"></span>[4642](#fn_4641) may take the name of Jew not from
Judah, son of Jacob, but from Him, since they are His brethren, and
praise Him for the freedom they have attained.  For it is He who sets
them free, saving them from their enemies on whose backs He lays His
hand to subdue them.  When He has put under His feet the opposing power,
and is alone in presence of His Father, then He is Jacob and Israel; and
thus as we are made light by Him, since He is the light of the world, so
we are made Jacob since He is called Jacob, and Israel since He is
called Israel.
