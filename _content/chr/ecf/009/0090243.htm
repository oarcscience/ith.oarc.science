<p class="c35"><a name="xv.iii.ii.iv-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xv.iii.ii.iv-p1.1"></A>4.&#160; That the Logos is One, Not Many.&#160; Of the Word, Faithful and True, and of His White Horse.</span></p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.ii.iv-p2"></A>&#8220;<i>He was in the beginning with God.</i>&#8221;&#160; By his three foregoing propositions the Evangelist has made us acquainted with three orders, and he now sums up the three in one, saying, &#8220;This (Logos) was in the beginning with God.&#8221;&#160; In the first premiss we learned where the Logos was:&#160; He was in the beginning; then we learned with whom He was, with God; and then who He was, that He was God.&#160; He now points out by this word &#8220;He,&#8221; the Word who is God, and gathers up into a fourth proposition the three which went before, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word,&#8221; &#8220;The Word was with God,&#8221; and &#8220;The Word was God.&#8221;&#160; Now he says, He, this (Word) was in the beginning with God.&#160; The term beginning may be taken of the beginning of the world, so that we may learn from what is said that the Word was older than the things which were made from the beginning.&#160; For if &#8220;in the beginning God created heaven and earth,&#8221; but &#8220;He&#8221; was in the beginning, then the Logos is manifestly older than those things which were made at the beginning, older not only than the firmament and the dry land, but than the heavens and earth.&#160; Now some one might ask, and not unreasonably, why it is not said, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word of God, and the Word of God was with God, and the Word of God was God.&#8221;&#160; But he who asked such a question could be shown to be taking for granted that there are a plurality of logoi, differing perhaps from each other in kind, one being the word of God, another perhaps the word of angels, a third of men, and so on with the other logoi.&#160; Now, if this were so with the Logos, the case would be the same with wisdom and with righteousness.&#160; But it would be absurd that there should be a number of things equally to be called &#8220;The Word;&#8221; and the same would apply to wisdom and to righteousness.&#160; We shall be driven to confess that we ought not to look for a plurality of logoi, or of wisdom, or of righteousness, if we look at the case of truth.&#160; Any one will confess that there is only one truth; it could never be said in this case that there is one truth of God, and another of the angels, and another of man,&#8212;it lies in the nature of things that the truth about anything is one.&#160; Now, if truth be one, it is clear that the preparation of it and its demonstration, which is wisdom, must in reason be conceived as one, since what is regarded as wisdom cannot justly claim that title where truth, which is one, is absent from its grasp.&#160; But if truth is one and wisdom one, then Reason (Logos) also, which announces truth and makes truth simple and manifest to those who are fitted to receive it, will be one.&#160; This we say, by no means denying that truth and wisdom and reason are of God, but we wish to indicate the purpose of the omission in this passage of the words &#8220;of God,&#8221; and of the form of the statement, &#8220;In the beginning the Logos was with God.&#8221;&#160; The same John in the Apocalypse gives Him His name with the addition &#8220;of God,&#8221; where he says:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4667"></A><A HREF="#fn_4667"><FONT SIZE="1">4668</FONT></A>
&#160; &#8220;And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and He that sat thereon called Faithful and True; and in righteousness doth He judge and make war.&#160; And His eyes are as a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems, and He hath a name written which no one knoweth but He Himself.&#160; And He is arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood, and His name is called&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4668"></A><A HREF="#fn_4668"><FONT SIZE="1">4669</FONT></A>
 Word of God.&#160; And His armies in heaven followed Him on white horses, clothed in pure fine linen.&#160; And out of His mouth proceedeth a sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations, and He shall rule them with a rod of iron, and He treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God.&#160; And He hath on His garment and on His thigh a name written:&#160; King of kings, and Lord of lords.&#8221;&#160; In this passage Logos is necessarily spoken of absolutely without the article, and also with the addition Logos of God; had the first not been the case (i.e., had the article been given) we might have been led to take up the meaning wrongly,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4669"></A><A HREF="#fn_4669"><FONT SIZE="1">4670</FONT></A>
 and so to depart from the truth about the Logos.&#160; For if it had been called simply Logos, and had not been said to be the Logos of God, then we would not be clearly informed that the Logos is the Logos of God.&#160; And, again, had it been called Logos of God but not said to be Logos absolutely, then we might imagine many logoi, according to the constitution <A NAME="page_326"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 326</FONT></A> <a name="xv.iii.ii.iv-Page_326"></A>of each of the rational beings which exist; then we might assume a number of logoi properly so called.&#160; Again, in his description in the Apocalypse of the Logos of God, the Apostle and Evangelist (and the Apocalypse entitles him to be styled a prophet, too) says he saw the Word of God in the opened heaven, and that He was riding on a white horse.&#160; Now we must consider what he means to convey when he speaks of heaven being opened and of the white horse, and of the Word of God riding on the white horse, and also what is meant by saying that the Word of God is Faithful and True, and that in righteousness He judges and makes war.&#160; All this will greatly advance our study on the subject of the Word of God.&#160; Now I conceive heaven to have been shut against the ungodly, and those who bear the image of the earthly, and to have been opened to the righteous and those adorned with the image of the heavenly.&#160; For to the former, being below and still dwelling in the flesh, the better things are closed, since they cannot understand them and have neither power nor will to see their beauty, looking down as they do and not striving to look up.&#160; But to the excellent, or those who have their commonwealth in heaven,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4670"></A><A HREF="#fn_4670"><FONT SIZE="1">4671</FONT></A>
 he opens, with the key of David, the things in heavenly places and discloses them to their view, and makes all clear to them by riding on his horse.&#160; These words also have their meaning; the horse is white because it is the nature of higher knowledge (<span class="Greek"><a name="xv.iii.ii.iv-p6.2"></A>&#947;&#957;&#8182;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>) to be clear and white and full of light.&#160; And on the white horse sits He who is called Faithful, seated more firmly, and so to speak more royally, on words which cannot be set aside, words which run sharply and more swiftly than any horse, and overhear in their rushing course every so-called word that simulates the Word, and every so-called truth that simulates the Truth.&#160; He who sits on the white horse is called Faithful, not because of the faith He cherishes, but of that which He inspires, because He is worthy of faith.&#160; Now the Lord Jehovah, according to Moses,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4671"></A><A HREF="#fn_4671"><FONT SIZE="1">4672</FONT></A>
 is Faithful and True.&#160; He is true also in respect of His relation to shadow, type, and image; for such is the Word who is in the opened heaven, for He is not on earth as He is in heaven; on earth He is made flesh and speaks through shadow, type, and image.&#160; The multitude, therefore, of those who are reputed to believe are disciples of the shadow of the Word, not of the true Word of God which is in the opened heaven.&#160; Hence Jeremiah says,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4672"></A><A HREF="#fn_4672"><FONT SIZE="1">4673</FONT></A>
 &#8220;The Spirit of our face is Christ the Lord, of whom we said, In His shadow shall we live among the nations.&#8221;&#160; Thus the Word of God who is called Faithful is also called True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war; since He has received from God the faculty of judging in very righteousness and very judgment, and of apportioning its due to every existing creature.&#160; For none of those who have some portion of righteousness and of the faculty of judgment can receive on his soul such copies and impressions of righteousness and judgment as to come short in no point of absolute righteousness and absolute justice, just as no painter of a picture can communicate to the representation all the qualities of the original.&#160; This, I conceive, is the reason why David says,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4673"></A><A HREF="#fn_4673"><FONT SIZE="1">4674</FONT></A>
 &#8220;Before Thee shall no living being be justified.&#8221;&#160; He does not say, no man, or no angel, but no living being, since even if any being partakes of life and has altogether put off mortality, not even then can it be justified in comparison of Thee, who art, as it were, Life itself.&#160; Nor is it possible that one who partakes of life and is therefore called living, should become life itself, or that one who partakes of righteousness and, therefore, is called righteous should become equal to righteousness itself.&#160; Now it is the function of the Word of God, not only to judge in righteousness, but also to make war in righteousness, that by making war on His enemies by reason and righteousness, so that what is irrational and wicked is destroyed,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4674"></A><A HREF="#fn_4674"><FONT SIZE="1">4675</FONT></A>
 He may dwell in the soul of him who, for his salvation, so to speak, has become captive to Christ, and may justify that soul and cast out from her all adversaries.&#160; We shall, however, obtain a better view of this war which the Word carries on if we remember that He is an ambassador for the truth, while there is another who pretends to be the Word and is not, and one who calls herself the truth and is not, but a lie.&#160; Then the Word, arming Himself against the lie, slays it with the breath of His mouth and brings it to naught by the manifestation of His coming.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4675"></A><A HREF="#fn_4675"><FONT SIZE="1">4676</FONT></A>
&#160; And consider whether these words of the Apostle to the Thessalonians may be understood in an intellectual sense.&#160; For what is that which is destroyed by the breath of the mouth of Christ, Christ being the Word and Truth and Wisdom, but the lie?&#160; And what is that which is brought <A NAME="page_327"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 327</FONT></A> <a name="xv.iii.ii.iv-Page_327"></A>to naught by the manifestation of Christ&#146;s coming, Christ being conceived as wisdom and reason, what but that which announces itself as wisdom, when in reality it is one of those things with which God deals as the Apostle describes,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4676"></A><A HREF="#fn_4676"><FONT SIZE="1">4677</FONT></A>
 &#8220;He taketh the wise, those who are not wise with the true wisdom, in their own craftiness&#8221;?&#160; To what he says of the rider on the white horse, John adds the wonderful statement:&#160; &#8220;His eyes are like a flame of fire.&#8221;&#160; For as the flame of fire is bright and illuminating, but at the same time fiery and destructive of material things, so, if I may so say, are the eyes of the Logos with which He sees, and every one who has part in Him; they have not only the inherent quality of laying hold of the things of the mind, but also that of consuming and putting away those conceptions which are more material and gross, since whatever is in any way false flees from the directness and lightness of truth.&#160; It is in a very natural order that after speaking of Him who judges in righteousness and makes war in accordance with His righteous judgments, and then after His warring of His giving light, the writer goes on to say, &#8220;On His head are many diadems.&#8221;&#160; For had the lie been one, and of one form only, against which the True and Faithful Word contended, and for conquering which, He was crowned, then one crown alone would naturally have been given Him for the victory.&#160; As it is, however, as the lies are many which profess the truth and for warring against which the Word is crowned, the diadems are many which surround the head of the conqueror of them all.&#160; As He has overcome every revolting power many diadems mark His victory.&#160; Then after the diadems He is said to have a name written which no one knows but He Himself.&#160; For there are some things which are known to the Word alone; for the beings which come into existence after Him have a poorer nature than His, and none of them is able to behold all that He apprehends.&#160; And perhaps it is the case that only those who have part in that Word know the things which are kept from the knowledge of those who do not partake of Him.&#160; Now, in John&#146;s vision, the Word of God as He rides on the white horse is not naked:&#160; He is clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood, for the Word who was made flesh and therefore died is surrounded with marks of the fact that His blood was poured out upon the earth, when the soldier pierced His side.&#160; For of that passion, even should it be our lot some day to come to that highest and supreme contemplation of the Logos, we shall not lose all memory, nor shall we forget the truth that our admission was brought about by His sojourning in our body.&#160; This Word of God is followed by the heavenly armies one and all; they follow the Word as their leader, and imitate Him in all things, and chiefly in having mounted, they also, white horses.&#160; To him that understands, this secret is open.&#160; And as sorrow and grief and wailing fled away at the end of things, so also, I suppose, did obscurity and doubt, all the mysteries of God&#146;s wisdom being precisely and clearly opened.&#160; Look also at the white horses of the followers of the Word and at the white and pure linen with which they were clothed.&#160; As linen comes out of the earth, may not those linen garments stand for the dialects on the earth in which those voices are clothed which make clear announcements of things?&#160; We have dealt at some length with the statements found in the Apocalypse about the Word of God; it is important for us to know clearly about Him.</p>
