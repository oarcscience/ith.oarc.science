<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>24.  The Offending Hand, or Foot, or
Eye.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxiv-p2"></span>And it is well, then, if the eye and
the hand are deserving of praise, that the eye cannot with reason say to
the hand, “I have no need of thee.” <span
id="fr_5969"></span>[5970](#fn_5969)   But if any one in the whole body
of the congregations of the church, who because of his practical gifts
has the name of hand, should change and become a hand causing to
stumble, let the eye say to such a hand, “I have no need of thee,” and,
saying it, let him cut it off and cast it from him. <span
id="fr_5970"></span>[5971](#fn_5970)   And so it is well, if any head be
blessed, and the feet worthy of the blessed head, so that the head
observing the things which are becoming to itself, may not be able to
say to the feet, “I have no need of you.”  If, however, any foot be
found to become a stumbling-block to the whole body, let the head say to
such a foot, “I have no need of thee,” and having cast it off, let him
cast it from himself; for even it is much better that the rest of the
body should enter into life, wanting the foot or the hand which caused
the stumbling-block, rather than, when the stumbling-block has spread
over the whole body, it should be cast into the hell of fire with the
two feet or the two hands.  And so it is well, that he who can become
the eye of the whole body should be worthy of Christ and of the whole
body; but if such an eye should ever change, and become a
stumbling-block to the whole body, it is well to take it out and cast it
outside the whole body, and that the rest of the body without that eye
should be saved, rather than that along with it, when the whole body has
been corrupted, the whole body should be cast into the hell of
fire. <span id="fr_5971"></span>[5972](#fn_5971)   For the practical
faculty of the soul, if prone to sin, and the walking faculty of the
soul, so to speak, if prone to sin, and the faculty of clear vision, if
prone to sin, may be the hand that causes to stumble, and the foot that
causes to stumble, and the eye that causes to stumble, which things it
is better to cast away, and having put them aside to enter into life
without them, like as one halt, or maimed, or one-eyed, rather than
along with them to lose the whole soul.  And likewise in the case of the
soul it is a good and blessed thing to use its power for the noblest
ends; but if we are going to lose one for any cause, it is better to
lose the use of it, that along with the other powers we may be saved.
