<p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.v.xxx-p2"></A>But if you will understand the differences of the Word which by &#8220;the foolishness of preaching&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5743"></A><A HREF="#fn_5743"><FONT SIZE="1">5744</FONT></A>
 is proclaimed to those who believe, and spoken in wisdom to them that are perfect, you will see in what way the Word has the form of a slave to those who are learning the rudiments, so that they say, &#8220;We saw Him and He had no form or beauty.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5744"></A><A HREF="#fn_5744"><FONT SIZE="1">5745</FONT></A>
&#160; But to the perfect He comes &#8220;in the glory of His own Father,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5745"></A><A HREF="#fn_5745"><FONT SIZE="1">5746</FONT></A>
 who might say, &#8220;and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5746"></A><A HREF="#fn_5746"><FONT SIZE="1">5747</FONT></A>
&#160; For indeed to the perfect appears the glory of the Word, and the only-begotten of God His Father, and the fulness of grace and likewise of truth, which that man cannot perceive who requires the &#8220;foolishness of the preaching,&#8221; in order to believe.&#160; But &#8220;the Son of man shall come in the glory of His own Father&#8221; not alone, but &#8220;with His own angels.&#8221;&#160; And if you can conceive of all those who are fellow-helpers in the glory of the Word, and in the revelation of the Wisdom which is Christ, coming along with Him, you will see in what way the Son of man comes in the glory of His own Father with His own angels.&#160; And consider whether you can in this connection say that the prophets who formerly suffered in virtue of their word having &#8220;no form or beauty&#8221; had an analogous position to the Word who had &#8220;no form or beauty.&#8221;&#160; And, as the Son of man comes in the glory of His own Father, so the angels, who are the words in the prophets, are present with Him preserving the measure of their own glory.&#160; But when the Word comes in such form with His own angels, He will give to each a part of His own glory and of the brightness of His own angels, according to the action of each.&#160; But we say these things not rejecting even the second coming of the Son of God understood in its simpler form.&#160; But when shall these things happen?&#160; Shall it be when that apostolic oracle is fulfilled which says, &#8220;For we must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether it be good or bad?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5747"></A><A HREF="#fn_5747"><FONT SIZE="1">5748</FONT></A>
&#160; But if He will render to each according to his deed, not the good deed only, nor the evil apart from the good, it is manifest that He will render to each according to every evil, and according to every good, deed.&#160; But I suppose&#8212;in this also following the Apostle, but comparing also the sayings of Ezekiel, in which the sins of him who is a perfect convert are wiped out, and the former uprightness of him who has utterly fallen away is not held of account&#8212;that in the case of him who is perfected, and has altogether laid aside wickedness, the sins are wiped out, but that, in the case of him who has altogether revolted from piety, if anything good was formerly done by him, it is not taken into account.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5748"></A><A HREF="#fn_5748"><FONT SIZE="1">5749</FONT></A>
&#160; But to us, who occupy a middle position between the perfect man and the apostate, when we stand before the judgment-seat of Christ,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5749"></A><A HREF="#fn_5749"><FONT SIZE="1">5750</FONT></A>
 there is rendered what we have done, whether good or bad; for we have not been so pure that our evil deeds are not at all imputed unto us, nor have we fallen away to such an extent that our better actions are forgotten.</p>
