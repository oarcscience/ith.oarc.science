<p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.ii.vi-p2"></A>&#8220;<i>All things were made through Him.</i>&#8221;&#160; The &#8220;through&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4677"></A><A HREF="#fn_4677"><FONT SIZE="1">4678</FONT></A>
 whom&#8221; is never found in the first place but always in the second, as in the Epistle to the Romans,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4678"></A><A HREF="#fn_4678"><FONT SIZE="1">4679</FONT></A>
 &#8220;Paul a servant of Christ Jesus, a called Apostle, separated to the Gospel of God which He promised before by His prophets in Holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh, determined the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we received grace and apostleship, for obedience of the faith among all the nations, for His name&#146;s sake.&#8221;&#160; For God promised aforehand by the prophets His own Gospel, the prophets being His ministers, and having their word to speak about Him &#8220;through whom.&#8221;&#160; And again God gave grace and apostleship to Paul and to the others for the obedience of the faith among all the nations, and this He gave them through Jesus Christ the Saviour, for the &#8220;through whom&#8221; belonged to Him.&#160; And the Apostle Paul says in the Epistle to the Hebrews:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4679"></A><A HREF="#fn_4679"><FONT SIZE="1">4680</FONT></A>
&#160; &#8220;At the end of the days He spoke to us in His Son, whom He made the heir of all things, &#145;through whom&#146; also He made the ages,&#8221; showing us that God made the ages through His Son, the &#8220;through whom&#8221; belonging, when the ages were being made, to the Only-begotten.&#160; Thus, if all things were made, as in this passage also, <i>through</i> the Logos, then they were not made <i>by</i> the Logos, but by a stronger and greater than He.&#160; And who else could this be but the Father?&#160; Now if, as we have seen, all things were made through Him, we have to enquire if the Holy Spirit also was made through Him.&#160; It appears to me that those who hold the Holy Spirit to be created, and who also admit that &#8220;all things were made through Him,&#8221; must necessarily assume that the Holy Spirit was made through the Logos, the Logos accordingly being older than He.&#160; And he who shrinks from allowing the Holy Spirit to have been made through Christ must, if he admits the truth of the statements of this Gospel, assume the Spirit to be uncreated.&#160; There is a third resource besides these two (that of allowing the Spirit to have been made by the Word, and that of regarding it as uncreated), namely, to assert that the Holy Spirit has no essence of His own beyond the Father and the Son.&#160; But on further thought one may perhaps see reason to consider that the Son is second beside the Father, He being the same as the Father, while manifestly a distinction is drawn between the Spirit and the Son in the passage,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4680"></A><A HREF="#fn_4680"><FONT SIZE="1">4681</FONT></A>
 &#8220;Whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him, but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, he shall not have forgiveness, either in this world or in the world to come.&#8221;&#160; We consider, therefore, that there are three hypostases, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit; and at the same time we believe nothing to be uncreated but the Father.&#160; We therefore, as the more pious and the truer course, admit that all things were made by the Logos, and that the Holy Spirit is the most excellent and the first in order&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4681"></A><A HREF="#fn_4681"><FONT SIZE="1">4682</FONT></A>
 of all that was made by the Father through Christ.&#160; And this, perhaps, is the reason why the Spirit is not said to be God&#146;s own Son.&#160; The Only-begotten only is by nature and from the beginning a Son, and the Holy Spirit seems to have need of the Son, to minister to Him His essence, so as to enable Him not only to exist, but to be wise and reasonable and just, and all that we must think of Him as being. &#160;All this He has by participation of <A NAME="page_329"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 329</FONT></A> <a name="xv.iii.ii.vi-Page_329"></A>the character of Christ, of which we have spoken above.&#160; And I consider that the Holy Spirit supplies to those who, through Him and through participation in Him, are called saints, the material of the gifts, which come from God; so that the said material of the gifts is made powerful by God, is ministered by Christ, and owes its actual existence in men to the Holy Spirit.&#160; I am led to this view of the charisms by the words of Paul which he writes somewhere,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4682"></A><A HREF="#fn_4682"><FONT SIZE="1">4683</FONT></A>
 &#8220;There are diversities of gifts but the same Spirit, and diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord.&#160; And there are diversities of workings, but it is the same God that worketh all in all.&#8221;&#160; The statement that all things were made by Him, and its seeming corollary, that the Spirit must have been called into being by the Word, may certainly raise some difficulty.&#160; There are some passages in which the Spirit is placed above Christ; in Isaiah, for example, Christ declares that He is sent, not by the Father only, but also by the Holy Spirit.&#160; &#8220;Now the Lord hath sent Me,&#8221; He says,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4683"></A><A HREF="#fn_4683"><FONT SIZE="1">4684</FONT></A>
 &#8220;and His Spirit,&#8221; and in the Gospel He declares that there is forgiveness for the sin committed against Himself, but that for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit there is no forgiveness, either in this age or in the age to come.&#160; What is the reason of this?&#160; Is it because the Holy Spirit is of more value than Christ that the sin against Him cannot be forgiven?&#160; May it not rather be that all rational beings have part in Christ, and that forgiveness is extended to them when they repent of their sins, while only those have part in the Holy Spirit who have been found worthy of it, and that there cannot well be any forgiveness for those who fall away to evil in spite of such great and powerful cooperation, and who defeat the counsels of the Spirit who is in them.&#160; When we find the Lord saying, as He does in Isaiah, that He is sent by the Father and by His Spirit, we have to point out here also that the Spirit is not originally superior to the Saviour, but that the Saviour takes a lower place than He in order to carry out the plan which has been made that the Son of God should become man.&#160; Should any one stumble at our saying that the Saviour in becoming man was made lower than the Holy Spirit, we ask him to consider the words used in the Epistle to the Hebrews,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4684"></A><A HREF="#fn_4684"><FONT SIZE="1">4685</FONT></A>
 where Jesus is shown by Paul to have been made less than the angels on account of the suffering of death.&#160; &#8220;We behold Him,&#8221; he says, &#8220;who hath been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour.&#8221;&#160; And this, too, has doubtless to be added, that the creation, in order to be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and not least of all the human race, required the introduction into human nature of a happy and divine power, which should set right what was wrong upon the earth, and that this action fell to the share, as it were, of the Holy Spirit; but the Spirit, unable to support such a task, puts forward the Saviour as the only one able to endure such a conflict.&#160; The Father therefore, the principal, sends the Son, but the Holy Spirit also sends Him and directs Him to go before, promising to descend, when the time comes, to the Son of God, and to work with Him for the salvation of men.&#160; This He did, when, in a bodily shape like a dove, He flew to Him after the baptism.&#160; He remained on Him, and did not pass Him by, as He might have done with men not able continuously to bear His glory.&#160; Thus John, when explaining how he knew who Christ was, spoke not only of the descent of the Spirit on Jesus, but also of its remaining upon him.&#160; For it is written that John said:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4685"></A><A HREF="#fn_4685"><FONT SIZE="1">4686</FONT></A>
&#160; &#8220;He who sent me to baptize said, On whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit and with fire.&#8221;&#160; It is not said only, &#8220;On whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending,&#8221; for the Spirit no doubt descended on others too, but &#8220;descending and abiding on Him.&#8221;&#160; Our examination of this point has been somewhat extended, since we were anxious to make it clear that if all things were made by Him, then the Spirit also was made through the Word, and is seen to be one of the &#8220;all things&#8221; which are inferior to their Maker.&#160; This view is too firmly settled to be disturbed by a few words which may be adduced to the opposite effect.&#160; If any one should lend credence to the Gospel according to the Hebrews, where the Saviour Himself says, &#8220;My mother, the Holy Spirit took me just now by one of my hairs and carried me off to the great mount Tabor,&#8221; he will have to face the difficulty of explaining how the Holy Spirit can be the mother of Christ when it was itself brought into existence through the Word.&#160; But neither the passage nor this difficulty is hard to explain.&#160; For if he who does the will of the Father in heaven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4686"></A><A HREF="#fn_4686"><FONT SIZE="1">4687</FONT></A>
 is Christ&#146;s brother and sister and mother, and if the name of brother of Christ may be applied, not only to the race of men, but to beings of diviner rank than they, <A NAME="page_330"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 330</FONT></A> <a name="xv.iii.ii.vi-Page_330"></A>then there is nothing absurd in the Holy Spirit&#146;s being His mother, every one being His mother who does the will of the Father in heaven.</p> 
<p class="c13"><a name="xv.iii.ii.vi-p13"></A>On the words, &#8220;All things were made by Him,&#8221; there is still one point to be examined.&#160; The &#8220;word&#8221; is, as a notion, from &#8220;life,&#8221; and yet we read, &#8220;What was made in the Word was life, and the life was the light of men.&#8221;&#160; Now as all things were made through Him, was the life made through Him, which is the light of men, and the other notions under which the Saviour is presented to us?&#160; Or must we take the &#8220;all things were made by Him&#8221; subject to the exception of the things which are in Himself?&#160; The latter course appears to be the preferable one.&#160; For supposing we should concede that the life which is the light of men was made through Him, since it said that the life &#8220;was made&#8221; the light of men, what are we to say about wisdom, which is conceived as being prior to the Word?&#160; That, therefore, which is about the Word (His relations or conditions) was not made by the Word, and the result is that, with the exception of the notions under which Christ is presented, all things were made through the Word of God, the Father making them in wisdom.&#160; &#8220;In wisdom hast Thou made them all,&#8221; it says,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4687"></A><A HREF="#fn_4687"><FONT SIZE="1">4688</FONT></A>
 not <i>through</i>, but <i>in</i> wisdom.</p>
