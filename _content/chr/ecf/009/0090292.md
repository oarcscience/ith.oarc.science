id="xv.iii.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>16.  Comparison of John’s Testimony to
Jesus in the Different Gospels.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.xvi-p2"></span>It may not be out of place, as we are
examining the text, “I baptize with water,” to compare the parallel
utterances of the evangelists with this of John.  Matthew reports that
the Baptist, when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to
his baptism, after the words of rebuke which we have already studied,
went on: <span id="fr_4906"></span>[4907](#fn_4906)   “I indeed baptize
you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me is mightier
than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you with
the Holy Ghost, and with fire.”  This agrees with the words in John, in
which the Baptist declares himself to those sent by the Pharisees, on
the subject of his baptizing with water.  Mark, again, says, <span
id="fr_4907"></span>[4908](#fn_4907) “John preached, saying, There
cometh after me He that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I
am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.  I baptized you with water, but
He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.”  And Luke says <span
id="fr_4908"></span>[4909](#fn_4908) that, as the people were in
expectation, and all were reasoning in their hearts concerning John,
whether haply he were the Christ, John answered them all, saying, “I
indeed baptize you with water; but there cometh one mightier than I,
whose shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloose; He shall baptize you with
the Holy Ghost, and with fire.”
