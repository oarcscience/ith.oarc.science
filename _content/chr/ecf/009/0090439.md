<span id="xvi.ii.v.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xlii-p1.1"></span>42.  The Meaning of the “Bright
Cloud.”</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xlii-p2"></span>Next to these come the words, “*While
He was yet speaking, behold, also, a bright cloud overshadowed
them,*” <span id="fr_5813"></span>[5814](#fn_5813) etc.  Now, I think
that God, wishing to dissuade Peter from making three tabernacles, under
which so far as it depended on his choice he was going to dwell, shows a
tabernacle better, so to speak, and much more excellent, the cloud.  For
since it is the function of a tabernacle <span id="page_473">p.
473</span> <span id="xvi.ii.v.xlii-Page_473"></span>to overshadow him
who is in it, and to shelter him, and the bright cloud overshadowed
them, God made, as it were, a diviner tabernacle, inasmuch as it was
bright, that it might be to them a pattern of the resurrection to come;
for a bright cloud overshadows the just, who are at once protected and
illuminated and shone upon by it.  But what might the bright cloud,
which overshadows the just, be?  Is it, perhaps, the fatherly power,
from which comes the voice of the Father bearing testimony to the Son as
beloved and well-pleasing, and exhorting those who were under its shadow
to hear Him and no other one?  But as He speaks of old, so also always
does He speak through what He wills.  And perhaps, too, the Holy Spirit
is the bright cloud which overshadows the just, and prophesies of the
things of God, who works in it, and says, “This is My beloved Son in
whom I am well-pleased;” but I would venture also to say that our
Saviour is a bright cloud.  When, therefore, Peter said, “Let us make
here three tabernacles,” <span id="fr_5814"></span>[5815](#fn_5814) …one
from the Father Himself, and from the Son, and one from the Holy
Spirit.  For a bright cloud of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
overshadows the genuine disciples of Jesus; or a cloud overshadows the
Gospel and the law and the prophets, which is bright to him who is able
to see the light of it in the Gospel, and the law, and the prophets. 
But perhaps the voice from the cloud says to Moses and Elijah, “This is
My beloved Son in whom I am well-pleased, hear Him,” as they were
desirous to see the Son of man, and to hear Him, and to behold Him as He
was in glory.  And perhaps it teaches the disciples that He who was, in
a literal sense, the Son of God, and His beloved in whom He was
well-pleased, whom it behoved them especially to hear, was He who was
then beheld, and transfigured, and whose face shone as the sun, and who
was clothed with garments white as the light.
