<p class="c35"><a name="xv.iii.i.xxii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xv.iii.i.xxii-p1.1"></A>22.&#160; The Word Was in the Beginning, I.e., in Wisdom, Which Contained All Things in Idea, Before They Existed.&#160; Christ&#146;s Character as Wisdom is Prior to His Other Characters.</span></p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.i.xxii-p2"></A>So many meanings occur to us at once of the word arche.&#160; We have now to ask which of them we should adopt for our text, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word.&#8221;&#160; It is plain that we may at once dismiss the meaning which connects it with transition or with a road and its length.&#160; Nor, it is pretty plain, will the meaning connected with an origin serve our purpose.&#160; One might, however, think of the sense in which it points to the author, to that which brings about the effect, if, as we read,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4543"></A><A HREF="#fn_4543"><FONT SIZE="1">4544</FONT></A>
 &#8220;God commanded and they were created.&#8221;&#160; For Christ is, in a manner, the demiurge, to whom the Father says, &#8220;Let there be light,&#8221; and &#8220;Let there be a firmament.&#8221;&#160; But Christ is demiurge as a beginning (arche), inasmuch as He is wisdom.&#160; It is in virtue of His being wisdom that He is called arche.&#160; For Wisdom says in Solomon:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4544"></A><A HREF="#fn_4544"><FONT SIZE="1">4545</FONT></A>
&#160; &#8220;God created me the beginning of His ways, for His works,&#8221; so that the Word might be in an arche, namely, in wisdom.&#160; Considered in relation to the structure of contemplation and thoughts about the whole of things, it is regarded as wisdom; but in relation to that side of the objects of thought, in which reasonable beings apprehend them, it is considered as the Word.&#160; And there is no wonder, since, as we have said before, the Saviour is many good things, if He comprises in Himself thoughts of the first order, and of the second, and of the third.&#160; This is what John suggested when he said about the Word:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4545"></A><A HREF="#fn_4545"><FONT SIZE="1">4546</FONT></A>
&#160; &#8220;That which was made was life in Him.&#8221;&#160; Life then came in the Word.&#160; And on the one side the Word is no other than the Christ, the Word, He who was with the Father, by whom all things were made; while, on the other side, the Life is no other than the Son of God, who says:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4546"></A><A HREF="#fn_4546"><FONT SIZE="1">4547</FONT></A>
&#160; &#8220;I am the way and the truth and the life.&#8221;&#160; As, then, life came into being in the Word, so the Word in the arche.&#160; Consider, however, if we are at liberty to take this meaning of arche for our text:&#160; &#8220;In the beginning was the Word,&#8221; so as to obtain the meaning that all things came into being according to wisdom and according to the models of the system which are present in his thoughts.&#160; For I consider that as a house or a ship is built and fashioned in accordance with the sketches of the builder or designer, <A NAME="page_308"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 308</FONT></A> <a name="xv.iii.i.xxii-Page_308"></A>the house or the ship having their beginning (arche) in the sketches and reckonings in his mind, so all things came into being in accordance with the designs of what was to be, clearly laid down by God in wisdom.&#160; And we should add that having created, so to speak, ensouled&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4547"></A><A HREF="#fn_4547"><FONT SIZE="1">4548</FONT></A>
 wisdom, He left her to hand over, from the types which were in her, to things existing and to matter, the actual emergence of them, their moulding and their forms<span class="sc"><a name="xv.iii.i.xxii-p7.1"></A>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4548"></A><A HREF="#fn_4548"><FONT SIZE="1">4549</FONT></A>
&#160;</span> But I consider, if it be permitted to say this, that the beginning (arche) of real existence was the Son of God, saying:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4549"></A><A HREF="#fn_4549"><FONT SIZE="1">4550</FONT></A>
&#160; &#8220;I am the beginning and the end, the <span class="Greek"><a name="xv.iii.i.xxii-p9.2"></A>&#913;</span> and the <span class="Greek"><a name="xv.iii.i.xxii-p9.3"></A>&#937;</span>, the first and the last.&#8221;&#160; We must, however, remember that He is not the arche in respect of every name which is applied to Him.&#160; For how can He be the beginning in respect of His being life, when life came in the Word, and the Word is manifestly the arche of life?&#160; It is also tolerably evident that He cannot be the arche in respect of His being the first-born from the dead.&#160; And if we go through all His titles carefully we find that He is the arche only in respect of His being wisdom.&#160; Not even as the Word is He the arche, for the Word was in the arche.&#160; And so one might venture to say that wisdom is anterior to all the thoughts that are expressed in the titles of the first-born of every creature.&#160; Now God is altogether one and simple; but our Saviour, for many reasons, since God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4550"></A><A HREF="#fn_4550"><FONT SIZE="1">4551</FONT></A>
 set Him forth a propitiation and a first fruits of the whole creation, is made many things, or perhaps all these things; the whole creation, so far as capable of redemption, stands in need of Him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4551"></A><A HREF="#fn_4551"><FONT SIZE="1">4552</FONT></A>
&#160; And, hence, He is made the light of men, because men, being darkened by wickedness, need the light that shines in darkness, and is not overtaken by the darkness; had not men been in darkness, He would not have become the light of men.&#160; The same thing may be observed in respect of His being the first-born of the dead.&#160; For supposing the woman had not been deceived, and Adam had not fallen, and man created for incorruption had obtained it, then He would not have descended into the grave, nor would He have died, there being no sin, nor would His love of men have required that He should die, and if He had not died, He could not have been the first-born of the dead.&#160; We may also ask whether He would ever have become a shepherd, had man not been thrown together with the beasts which are devoid of reason, and made like to them.&#160; For if God saves man and beasts, He saves those beasts which He does save, by giving them a shepherd, since they cannot have a king.&#160; Thus if we collect the titles of Jesus, the question arises which of them were conferred on Him later, and would never have assumed such importance if the saints had begun and had also persevered in blessedness.&#160; Perhaps Wisdom would be the only remaining one, or perhaps the Word would remain too, or perhaps the Life, or perhaps the Truth, not the others, which He took for our sake.&#160; And happy indeed are those who in their need for the Son of God have yet become such persons as not to need Him in His character as a physician healing the sick, nor in that of a shepherd, nor in that of redemption, but only in His characters as wisdom, as the word and righteousness, or if there be any other title suitable for those who are so perfect as to receive Him in His fairest characters.&#160; So much for the phrase &#8220;In the beginning.&#8221;</p>
