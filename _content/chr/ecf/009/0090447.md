<span id="xvi.ii.vi.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>6.  Influence of the Moon and Stars on
Men.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.vi-p2"></span>Let us now, then, give heed to the
very letter of the passage, and first let us inquire, how he who has
been cast into darkness and repressed by an impure and deaf and dumb
spirit is said to be a “lunatic,” and for what reason the expression to
be a “lunatic” derives its name from the great light in heaven which is
next to the sun, which God appointed “to rule over the night.” <span
id="fr_5869"></span>[5870](#fn_5869)   Let physicians then, discuss the
physiology of the matter, inasmuch as they think that there is no impure
spirit in the case, but a bodily disorder, and inquiring into the nature
of things let them say, that the moist humours which are in the head are
moved by a certain sympathy which they have with the light of the moon,
which has a moist nature; but as for us, who also believe the Gospel
that this sickness is viewed as having been effected by an impure dumb
and deaf spirit in those who suffer from it, and who see that those, who
are accustomed like the magicians of the Egyptians to promise a cure in
regard to such, seem sometimes to be successful in their case, we will
say that, perhaps, with the view of slandering the creation of God, in
order that “unrighteousness may be spoken loftily, and that they may set
their mouth against the heaven,” <span
id="fr_5870"></span>[5871](#fn_5870) this impure spirit watches certain
configurations of the moon, and so makes it appear from observation of
men suffering at such and such a phase of the moon, that the cause of so
great an evil is not the dumb and deaf demon, but the great light in
heaven which was appointed “to rule by night,” and which has no power to
originate such a disorder among men.  But they all “speak
unrighteousness loftily,” as many as say, that the cause of all the
disorders which exist on the earth, whether of such generally or of each
in detail, arises from the disposition of the stars; and such have truly
“set their mouth against the heaven,” when they say that some of the
stars have a malevolent, and others a benevolent influence; since no
star was formed by the God of the universe to work evil, according to
Jeremiah as it is written in the Lamentations, “Out of the mouth of the
Lord shall come things noble and that which is good.” <span
id="fr_5871"></span>[5872](#fn_5871)   And it is probable that as this
impure spirit, producing what is called lunacy, observes the phases of
the moon, that it may work on him who for certain causes has been
committed to it, and who has not made himself worthy of the guardianship
of angels, so also there are other spirits and demons who work at
certain phases of the rest of the stars; so that not the moon only, but
the rest of the stars also may be calumniated by those “who speak
unrighteousness loftily.”  It is worth while, then, to listen to the
casters of nativities, who refer the origin of every form of madness and
every demoniacal possession to the phases of the moon.  That those,
then, who suffer from what is called lunacy sometimes fall into the
water is evident, and that they also fall into the fire, less frequently
indeed, yet it does happen; and it is evident that this disorder is very
difficult to cure, so that those who have the power to cure demoniacs
sometimes fail in respect of <span id="page_479">p. 479</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vi.vi-Page_479"></span>this, and sometimes with fastings and
supplications and more toils, succeed.  But you will inquire whether
there are such disorders in spirits as well as in men; so that some of
them speak, but some of them are speechless, and some of them hear, but
some are deaf; for as in them will be found the cause of their being
impure, so also, because of their freedom of will, are they condemned to
be speechless and deaf; for some men will suffer such condemnation if
the prayer of the prophet, as spoken by the Holy Spirit, shall be given
heed to, in which it is said of certain sinners, “Let the lying lips be
put to silence.” <span id="fr_5872"></span>[5873](#fn_5872)   And so,
perhaps, those who make a bad use of their hearing, and admit the
hearing of vanities, will be rendered deaf by Him who said, “Who hath
made the stone-deaf and the deaf,” <span
id="fr_5873"></span>[5874](#fn_5873) so that they may no longer lend an
ear to vain things.
