<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>24.  The Account of the Building of
Solomon’s Temple Contains Serious Difficulties and is to Be Interpreted
Spiritually.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxiv-p2"></span>For the sake of those, however, who
consider that nothing further than the narrative itself is meant to be
indicated in these words, it may not be unfitting to introduce at this
point some considerations which they can scarcely withstand, to show
that the words ought to be regarded as those of the Spirit, and that the
mind of the Spirit should be sought for in them.  Did the sons of the
kings really spend their time in hewing the great and precious stones,
and practise a craft so little in keeping with royal birth?  And the
number of the burden-bearers and of the stone-cutters and of the
officers, the duration, too, of the period of preparing the stones and
marking them, is all this recorded <span id="page_405">p. 405</span>
<span id="xv.iii.vi.xxiv-Page_405"></span>as it really was?  The holy
house, too, was got ready in peace and was to be built for God without
hammer or axe or any iron tool, that there might be no disturbance in
the house of God.  And again I would ask those who are in bondage to the
letter how it is possible that there should be eighty thousand
stone-cutters and that the house of God should be built out of hard
white stones without the noise of hammer or axe or any iron tool being
heard in His house while the building was going on?  Is it not living
stones that are hewn without any noise or tumult somewhere outside the
temple, so that they are brought ready prepared to the place which
awaits them in the building?  And there is some sort of an ascent about
the temple of God, not with angles, but with bends of straight lines. 
For it is written, <span id="fr_5123"></span>[5124](#fn_5123) “And there
was a winding staircase to the middle, and from the middle to the third
floor;” for the staircase in the house of God had to be spiral, thus
imitating in its ascent the circle, which is the most perfect figure. 
But that this house might be secure five ties are built in it, <span
id="fr_5124"></span>[5125](#fn_5124) as fair as possible, a cubit high,
that on looking up one might see it to be suggested how we rise from
sensible things to the so-called divine perceptions, and so be brought
to perceive those things which are seen only by the mind.  But the place
of the happier stones appears to be that called Dabir, <span
id="fr_5125"></span>[5126](#fn_5125) where the ark of the covenant of
the Lord was, and, as I may say, the handwriting of God, the tables
written with His own finger.  And the whole house is overlaid with gold;
“the whole house,” we read, <span id="fr_5126"></span>[5127](#fn_5126)
“he overlaid with gold until all the house was finished.”  But there
were two cherubim in Dabir, a word which the translators of the Hebrew
Bible into Greek failed to render satisfactorily.  Some, failing to do
justice to the language, render it the temple; but it is more sacred
than the temple.  Now everything about the house was made golden, for a
sign that the mind which is quite made perfect estimates accurately the
things perceived by the intellect.  But it is not given to all to
approach and know them; and hence the veil of the court is erected,
since to most of the priests and levites the things in the inmost part
of the temple are not revealed.
