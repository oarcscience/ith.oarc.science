id="xii.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Continuation Respecting
Repentance.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.viii-p2"></span>The ministers of the grace of God have,
by the Holy Spirit, spoken of repentance; and the Lord of all things has
himself declared with an oath regarding it, “As I live, saith the Lord,
I desire not the death of the sinner, but rather his repentance;” <span
id="fr_4042"></span>[4043](#fn_4042) adding, moreover, this gracious
declaration, “Repent, O house of Israel, of your iniquity.” <span
id="fr_4043"></span>[4044](#fn_4043)   Say to the children of my people,
Though your sins reach from earth to heaven, and though they be
redder <span id="fr_4044"></span>[4045](#fn_4044) than scarlet, and
blacker than sack-cloth, yet if ye turn to me with your whole heart, and
say, Father! I will listen to you, as to a holy <span
id="fr_4045"></span>[4046](#fn_4045) people.  And in another place He
speaks thus:  “Wash you and become clean; put away the wickedness of
your souls from before mine eyes; cease from your evil ways, and learn
to do well; seek out judgment, deliver the oppressed, judge the
fatherless, and see that justice is done to the widow; and come, and let
us reason together.  He declares, Though your sins be like crimson, I
will make them white as snow; though they be like scarlet, I will whiten
them like wool.  And if ye be willing and obey me, ye shall eat the good
of the land; but if ye refuse, and will not hearken unto me, the sword
shall devour you, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken these
things.” <span id="fr_4046"></span>[4047](#fn_4046)   Desiring,
therefore, that all His beloved should be partakers of repentance, He
has, by His almighty will, established \[these declarations\].
