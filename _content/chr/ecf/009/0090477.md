id="xvi.ii.vii.iv-p1.1"></span>4.  Harmony of the Old and New
Covenants.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.iv-p2"></span>And likewise it is a pleasant thing
to endeavour to understand and exhibit the fact of the concord of the
two covenants,—of the one before the bodily advent of the Saviour and of
the new covenant; for among those things in which the two covenants are
at concord so that there is no discord between them would be found
prayers, to the effect that about anything whatever they shall ask it
shall be done to them from the Father in heaven.  And if also you desire
the third that unites the two, do not hesitate to say that it is the
Holy Spirit, since “the words of the wise,” whether they be of those
before the advent, or at the time of the advent, or after it, “are as
goads, and as nails firmly fixed, which were given by agreement from one
shepherd.” <span id="fr_6068"></span>[6069](#fn_6068)   And do not let
this also pass unobserved, that He did not say, where two or three are
gathered together in My name, there “shall I be” in the midst of them,
but “there am I,” <span id="fr_6069"></span>[6070](#fn_6069) not going
to be, not delaying, but at the very moment of the concord being Himself
found, and being in the midst of them.
