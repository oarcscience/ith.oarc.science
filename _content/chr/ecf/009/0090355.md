<span id="xvi.ii.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>4.  Concerning the Parable of the
Treasure Hidden in the Field.  The Parable Distinguished from the
Similitude.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.iv-p2"></span>“*Again the kingdom of heaven is like
unto a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid.*” <span
id="fr_5177"></span>[5178](#fn_5177)   The former parables He spoke to
the multitudes; but this and the two which follow it, which are not
parables but similitudes in relation to the kingdom of heaven, He seems
to have spoken to the disciples when in the house.  In regard to this
and the next two, let him who “gives heed to reading” <span
id="fr_5178"></span>[5179](#fn_5178) inquire whether they are parables
at all.  In the case of the latter the Scripture does not hesitate to
attach in each case the name of parable; but in the present case it has
not done so; and that naturally.  For if He spoke to the multitudes in
parables, and “spake all these things in parables, and without a parable
spake nothing to them,” <span id="fr_5179"></span>[5180](#fn_5179) but
on going to the house He discourses not to the multitudes but to the
disciples who came to Him there, manifestly the things spoken in the
house were not parables:  for, to them that are without, even to those
to whom “it is not given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
heaven,” <span id="fr_5180"></span>[5181](#fn_5180) He speaks in
parables.  Some one will then say, If they are not really parables,
<span id="page_416">p. 416</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iii.iv-Page_416"></span>what are they?  Shall we then say in
keeping with the diction of the Scripture that they are similitudes
(comparisons)?  Now a similitude differs from a parable; for it is
written in Mark, “To what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or in
what parable shall we set it forth?” <span
id="fr_5181"></span>[5182](#fn_5181)   From this it is plain that there
is a difference between a similitude and a parable.  The similitude
seems to be generic, and the parable specific.  And perhaps also as the
similitude, which is the highest genus of the parable, contains the
parable as one of its species, so it contains that particular form of
similitude which has the same name as the genus.  This is the case with
other words as those skilled in the giving of many names have observed;
who say that “impulse” <span id="fr_5182"></span>[5183](#fn_5182) is the
highest genus of many species, as, for example, of
“disinclination” <span id="fr_5183"></span>[5184](#fn_5183) and
“inclination,” and say that, in the case of the species which has the
same name as the genus, “inclination” is taken in opposition to and in
distinction from “disinclination.”
