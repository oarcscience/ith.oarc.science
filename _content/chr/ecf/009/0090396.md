<span id="xvi.ii.iv.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>19.  Concerning the Seven Loaves.  The
Narrative of the Feeding of the Four Thousand Compared with that of the
Five Thousand.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iv.xix-p2"></span>“*And Jesus called unto Him His
disciples and said.*” <span id="fr_5534"></span>[5535](#fn_5534)   Above
in the similar history to this about the loaves, before the loaves are
spoken of, “Jesus came forth and saw a great multitude and had
compassion upon them and healed their sick.  And when even was come the
disciples came to Him saying, The place is desert and the time is
already past, send them away,” <span
id="fr_5535"></span>[5536](#fn_5535) etc.  But now after the healing of
the deaf and the rest, He takes compassion on the multitude which had
continued with Him now three days and had nothing to eat.  And there the
disciples make request concerning the five thousand; <span
id="fr_5536"></span>[5537](#fn_5536) but here He speaks of His own
accord about the four thousand. <span
id="fr_5537"></span>[5538](#fn_5537)   Those, too, are fed when it was
evening after they had spent a day with Him; but these, who are
testified to have continued with Him three days, partake of the loaves
lest they might faint by the way.  And there the disciples say to Him
when He was not inquiring, that they had only five loaves and two
fishes; but here to Him making inquiry, they give answer about the seven
loaves and the few small fishes.  And there He commands the multitudes
to sit down or lie upon the grass; for Luke also wrote, “Make them sit
down,” <span id="fr_5538"></span>[5539](#fn_5538) and Mark says, “He
commanded them all to sit down;” <span
id="fr_5539"></span>[5540](#fn_5539) but here He does not command but
proclaims <span id="fr_5540"></span>[5541](#fn_5540) to the multitude to
sit down.  Again, there, the three Evangelists say in the very same
words that “He took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to
heaven He blessed;” <span id="fr_5541"></span>[5542](#fn_5541) but here,
as Matthew and Mark have written, “Jesus gave thanks and brake;” <span
id="fr_5542"></span>[5543](#fn_5542) there, they recline upon the grass,
but here they sit down upon the ground.  You will moreover investigate
in the accounts in the different places the variation found in John, who
wrote in regard to that transaction that Jesus said, “Make the <span
id="page_449">p. 449</span> <span id="xvi.ii.iv.xix-Page_449"></span>men
sit down,” <span id="fr_5543"></span>[5544](#fn_5543) and that, having
given thanks, He gave of the loaves to them that were set down, but he
did not mention this miracle at all. <span
id="fr_5544"></span>[5545](#fn_5544)   Attending, then, to the
difference of those things which are written in the various places in
regard to the loaves, I think that these belong to a different order
from those; wherefore these are fed in a mountain, and those in a desert
place; and these after they had continued three days with Jesus, but
those one day, on the evening of which they were fed.  And further,
unless it be the same thing for Jesus to do a thing of Himself and to
act after having heard from the disciples, consider if those to whom
Jesus shows kindness are not superior when He fed them on the spot with
a view to showing them kindness.  And, if according to John, <span
id="fr_5545"></span>[5546](#fn_5545) they were barley loaves of which
the twelve baskets remained over, but nothing of this kind is said about
these, how are not these superior to the former?  And the sick of those
He healed, <span id="fr_5546"></span>[5547](#fn_5546) but here He heals
these, along with the multitudes, who were not sick but blind, and lame,
and deaf, and maimed; wherefore also in regard to these the four
thousand marvel, <span id="fr_5547"></span>[5548](#fn_5547) but in
regard to the sick no such thing is said.  And these I think who ate of
the seven loaves for which thanks were given, are superior to those who
ate of the five which were blessed; and these who ate the few little
fishes to those who ate of the two, and perhaps also these who sat down
upon the ground to those who sat down on the grass.  And those from
fewer loaves leave twelve baskets, but these from a greater number leave
seven baskets, inasmuch, as they were able to receive more.  And perhaps
these tread upon all earthly things and sit down upon them, but those
upon the grass—upon their flesh only—for “all flesh is grass.” <span
id="fr_5548"></span>[5549](#fn_5548)   Consider also after this, that
Jesus does not wish to send them away fasting lest they faint on the
way, as being without the loaves of Jesus, and while they were still on
the way—the way to their own concerns—might suffer injury.  Take note
also of the cases where Jesus is recorded to have sent any one away,
that you may see the difference of those who were sent away by Him after
being fed, and those who had been sent away otherwise; and, as a pattern
of one who was sent away otherwise, take “Woman, thou art loosed from
thine infirmity.” <span id="fr_5549"></span>[5550](#fn_5549)   But
further the disciples who are always with Jesus are not sent away by
Him; but the multitudes after they have eaten are sent away.  Likewise,
again, the disciples who conceive nothing great about the Canaanitish
woman say, “Send her away, for she crieth after us;” <span
id="fr_5550"></span>[5551](#fn_5550) but the Saviour does not at all
appear to send her away; for saying unto her, “O woman, great is thy
faith, be it done to thee even as thou wilt,” <span
id="fr_5551"></span>[5552](#fn_5551) He healed her daughter from that
hour:  it is not however written that He sent her away.  So far at the
present time have we been able to investigate and see into the passage
before us.
