<span id="xv.iii.i.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>34.  Christ as the First and the Last;
He is Also What Lies Between These.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xxxiv-p2"></span>Further, we have to ask in what
sense He is called in the Apocalypse the First and the Last, and how, in
His character as the First, He is not the same as the Alpha and the
beginning, while in His character as the Last He is not the same as the
Omega and the end.  It appears to me, then, that the reason<span
id="page_315">p. 315</span> <span
id="xv.iii.i.xxxiv-Page_315"></span>able beings which exist are
characterized by many forms, and that some of them are the first, some
the second, some the third, and so on to the last.  To pronounce
exactly, however, which is the first, what kind of a being the second
is, which may truly be designated third, and to carry this out to the
end of the series, this is not a task for man, but transcends our
nature.  We shall yet venture, such as we are, to stand still a little
at this point, and to make some observations on the matter.  There are
some gods of whom God is god, as we hear in prophecy, <span
id="fr_4610"></span>[4611](#fn_4610) “Thank ye the God of gods,”
and <span id="fr_4611"></span>[4612](#fn_4611) “The God of gods hath
spoken, and called the earth.”  Now God, according to the Gospel, <span
id="fr_4612"></span>[4613](#fn_4612) “is not the God of the dead but of
the living.”  Those gods, then, are living of whom God is god.  The
Apostle, too, writing to the Corinthians, says: <span
id="fr_4613"></span>[4614](#fn_4613)   “As there are gods many and lords
many,” and so we have spoken of these gods as really existing.  Now
there are, besides the gods of whom God is god, certain others, who are
called thrones, and others called dominions, lordships, also, and powers
in addition to these.  The phrase, <span
id="fr_4614"></span>[4615](#fn_4614) “above every name that is named,
not only in this world, but also in that which is to come,” leads us to
believe that there are yet others besides these which are less familiar
to us; one kind of these the Hebrews called Sabai, from which Sabaoth
was formed, who is their ruler, and is none other than God.  Add to all
these the reasonable being who is mortal, man.  Now the God of all
things made first in honour some race of reasonable beings; this I
consider to be those who are called gods, and the second order, let us
say, for the present, are the thrones, and the third, undoubtedly, the
dominions.  And thus we come down in order to the last reasonable race,
which, perhaps, cannot be any other than man.  The Saviour accordingly
became, in a diviner way than Paul, all things to all, that He might
either gain all or perfect them; it is clear that to men He became a
man, and to the angels an angel.  As for His becoming man no believer
has any doubt, but as to His becoming an angel, we shall find reason for
believing it was so, if we observe carefully the appearances and the
words of the angels, in some of which the powers of the angels seem to
belong to Him.  In several passages angels speak in such a way as to
suggest this, as when <span id="fr_4615"></span>[4616](#fn_4615) “the
angel of the Lord appeared in a flame of fire.  And he said, I am the
God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.”  But Isaiah also says: <span
id="fr_4616"></span>[4617](#fn_4616)    “His name is called Angel of
Great Counsel.”  The Saviour, then, is the first and the last, not that
He is not what lies between, but the extremities are named to show that
He became all things.  Consider, however, whether the last is man, or
the things said to be under the earth, of which are the demons, all of
them or some.  We must ask, too, about those things which the Saviour
became which He speaks of through the prophet David, <span
id="fr_4617"></span>[4618](#fn_4617) “And I became as a man without any
to help him, free among the dead.”  His birth from the Virgin and His
life so admirably lived showed Him to be more than man, and it was the
same among the dead.  He was the only free person there, and His soul
was not left in hell.  Thus, then, He is the first and the last.  Again,
if there be letters of God, as such there are, by reading which the
saints may say they have read what is written on the tablets of heaven,
these letters, by which heavenly things are to be read, are the notions,
divided into small parts, into <span class="Greek"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xxxiv-p10.2"></span>Α</span> and so on to <span
class="Greek"><span id="xv.iii.i.xxxiv-p10.3"></span>Ω</span>, the Son
of God.  Again, He is the beginning and the end, but He is this not in
all His aspects equally.  For He is the beginning, as the Proverbs teach
us, inasmuch as He is wisdom; it is written:  “The Lord founded Me in
the beginning of His ways, for His works.”  In the respect of His being
the Logos He is not the beginning.  “The Word was in the beginning.” 
Thus in His aspects one comes first and is the beginning, and there is a
second after the beginning, and a third, and so on to the end, as if He
had said, I am the beginning. inasmuch as I am wisdom, and the second,
perhaps, inasmuch as I am invisible, and the third in that I am life,
for “what was made was life in Him.”  One who was qualified to examine
and to discern the sense of Scripture might, no doubt, find many members
of the series; I cannot say if he could find them all.  “The beginning
and the end” is a phrase we usually apply to a thing that is a completed
unity; the beginning of a house is its foundation and the end the
parapet.  We cannot but think of this figure, since Christ is the stone
which is the head of the corner, to the great unity of the body of the
saved.  For Christ the only-begotten Son is all and in all, He is as the
beginning in the man He assumed, He is present as the end in the last of
the saints, and He is also in those between, or else He is present <span
id="page_316">p. 316</span> <span id="xv.iii.i.xxxiv-Page_316"></span>as
the beginning in Adam, as the end in His life on earth, according to the
saying:  “The last Adam was made a quickening spirit.”  This saying
harmonizes well with the interpretation we have given of the first and
the last.
