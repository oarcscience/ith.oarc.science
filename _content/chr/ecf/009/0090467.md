<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xxvi-p1.1"></span>26.  The Little Ones and Their
Angels.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxvi-p2"></span>“*See that ye despise not one of
these little ones.*” <span id="fr_5973"></span>[5974](#fn_5973)   It
seems to me that as among the bodies of men there are differences in
point of size,—so that some are little, and others great, and others of
middle height, and, again, there are differences among the little, as
they are more or less little, and the same holds of the great, and of
those of middle height,—so also among the souls of men, there are some
things which give them the stamp of littleness, and other things the
stamp of greatness, so to speak, and generally, after the analogy of
things bodily, other things the stamp of mediocrity.  But in the case of
bodies, it is not due to the action of men but to the spermatic
principles, that one is short and little, another great, and another of
middle height; but in the case of souls, it is our free-will, and
actions of such a kind, and habits of such a kind, that furnish the
reason why one is great, or little, or of middle height; and it is of
our free-will either by advancing in stature to increase our size, or
not advancing to be short.  And so indeed I understand the words about
Jesus having assumed a human soul, “Jesus advanced;” <span
id="fr_5974"></span>[5975](#fn_5974) for as from the free-will there was
an advance of His soul in wisdom and grace, so also in stature.  And the
Apostle says, “Until we all attain unto a full-grown man, unto the
measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ;” <span
id="fr_5975"></span>[5976](#fn_5975) for we must think that he attains
unto a man, and that full-grown, according to the inner man, who has
gone through the things of the child, and has reached the stage of the
man, and has put away the things of the child, and generally, has
perfected the things of the man. <span
id="fr_5976"></span>[5977](#fn_5976)   And so we must suppose that there
is a certain measure of spiritual stature unto which the most perfect
soul can attain by magnifying the Lord, and become great.  Thus, then,
these became great, of whom this is written, Isaac, and Moses, and John,
and the Saviour Himself above all; for also about Him Gabriel said, “He
shall be great;” <span id="fr_5977"></span>[5978](#fn_5977) but the
little ones are “the newborn babes which long for the reasonable milk
which is without guile,” <span id="fr_5978"></span>[5979](#fn_5978) such
as stand in need of nursing-fathers and nursing-mothers, spoken of in
Isaiah when he says, about the calling from the Gentiles, “And they
shall bring the sons in the bosom, and take their daughters on the
shoulders, and kings shall be thy nursing-fathers and their princesses
thy nursing-mothers.” <span id="fr_5979"></span>[5980](#fn_5979)   For
these reasons you will, then, attend to the word, “Do not despise one of
these little ones,” <span id="fr_5980"></span>[5981](#fn_5980) and
consider whether it is their angels who bring them in their bosom, since
they have become sons, and also take on their shoulders what are called
daughters, and whether from them are the nursing-fathers who are called
kings, and the nursing-mothers who are called princesses.  And since the
little ones, pointed out by our Saviour, are under the stewardship as of
nursing-fathers and nursing-mothers, on this account I think that Moses,
who believed that he had been already assigned a place among the ranks
of the great, said, with regard to the promise, “My angel shall go
before you,” <span id="fr_5981"></span>[5982](#fn_5981)   “If thou
thyself do not go along with me, carry me not up hence.” <span
id="fr_5982"></span>[5983](#fn_5982)   For though the little one even be
an heir, yet as being a child he differs nothing from a servant when he
is a child, <span id="fr_5983"></span>[5984](#fn_5983) and to the extent
to which he is little “has the spirit of bondage to fear;” <span
id="fr_5984"></span>[5985](#fn_5984) but he who is not at all any longer
such has no longer the spirit of bondage, but already the spirit of
adoption, when “perfect love casteth out fear;” <span
id="fr_5985"></span>[5986](#fn_5985) it will be plain to thee, how that
according to these things “the angel of the Lord” is said “to encamp
round about them that fear Him, and to save them.” <span
id="fr_5986"></span>[5987](#fn_5986)   But you will consider, according
to these things also, whether these are indeed angels of the little ones
“who are led by the spirit of bondage to fear,” “when the angel of the
Lord encamps round about them that fear Him and delivereth them;” but of
the great, whether it is the Lord who is greater than the angels, who
might say about each of them, “I am with him in affliction;” <span
id="fr_5987"></span>[5988](#fn_5987) and, so long as we are imperfect,
and need one to assist us that we may be delivered from evils, we stand
in need of an angel of whom Jacob said, “The angel who delivered me from
all the evils;” <span id="fr_5988"></span>[5989](#fn_5988) but, when we
have become perfected, and have passed through the stage of being
subject to nursing-fathers and nursing-mothers and guardians and
stewards, <span id="fr_5989"></span>[5990](#fn_5989) we are meet to be
governed by the Lord Himself.
