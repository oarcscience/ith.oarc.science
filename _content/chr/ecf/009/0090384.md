<span id="xvi.ii.iv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>7.  The Healing of the Sick on the Other
Side.  The Method of Healing.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iv.vii-p2"></span>But after this both Jesus and Peter
will go up into the boat, and the wind will cease; and those in the
boat, perceiving the great dangers from which they have been saved, will
worship Him, saying, not simply, “Thou art the Son of God,” as also the
two demoniacs said, but, “Of a truth, Thou art the Son of God.” <span
id="fr_5394"></span>[5395](#fn_5394)   This the disciples in the boat
say, for I do not think that others than the disciples said so.  And
when we have undergone all these experiences, having crossed over, we
shall come to the land where Jesus commanded us to go before Him.  And
perhaps, also, some secret and occult mystery with reference to some who
were saved by Jesus is indicated by the words, “And when the men of that
place knew Him,”—plainly of the place on the other side,—“they sent into
all that region round about,”—round about the other side, not on the
other side itself, but round about it,—“and they brought unto Him all
that were sick.” <span id="fr_5395"></span>[5396](#fn_5395)   And here
observe that they brought unto Him not only many that were sick, but all
in that region round about; and the sick who were brought to Him
besought Him that they might touch if it were only the border of His
garment, <span id="fr_5396"></span>[5397](#fn_5396) beseeching this
grace from Him, since they were not like “the woman who had an issue of
blood twelve years, and who came behind Him and touched the border of
His garment, saying within herself, If I do but touch His garment, I
shall be made whole.” <span id="fr_5397"></span>[5398](#fn_5397)   For
observe in what is said about the border of His garment, on account of
what the flowing of her blood ceased at once.  But those from the
country round the land of Gennesaret, to which Jesus and His disciples
crossed over and came, did not come of themselves to Jesus, but were
brought by those who had sent the tidings, inasmuch as they were not
able because of their extreme weakness to come of themselves.  Nor did
they merely touch the garment, like the woman who had an issue of blood,
but they touched after that they had besought Him.  Only, of these, “as
many as touched were made whole.” <span
id="fr_5398"></span>[5399](#fn_5398)   And whether there be any
difference between the “They were made whole,” <span
id="fr_5399"></span>[5400](#fn_5399) which is said in their case, and
the “being saved,” <span id="fr_5400"></span>[5401](#fn_5400) —for it
was said to the woman with the issue of blood, “Thy faith hath saved
thee,” <span id="fr_5401"></span>[5402](#fn_5401) you may yourself
consider.
