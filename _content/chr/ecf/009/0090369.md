<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>18.  Prophets in Their Country.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xviii-p2"></span>“*But Jesus said unto them, A
prophet is not without honour, save in his own country.*” <span
id="fr_5271"></span>[5272](#fn_5271)   We must inquire whether the
expression has the same force when applied universally to every prophet
(as if each one of the prophets was dishonoured in his own country only,
but not as if every one who was dishonoured was dishonoured in his
country); or, because of the expression being singular, these things
were said about one.  If, then, these words are spoken about one, these
things which have been said suffice, if we refer that which is written
to the Saviour.  But if it is general, it is not historically true; for
Elijah did not suffer dishonour in Tishbeth of Gilead, nor Elisha in
Abelmeholah, nor Samuel in Ramathaim, nor Jeremiah in Anathoth.  But,
figuratively interpreted, it is absolutely true; for we must think of
Judæa as their country, and that famous Israel as their kindred, and
perhaps of the body as the house.  For all suffered dishonour in Judæa
from the Israel which is according to the flesh, while they were yet in
the body, as it is written in the Acts of the Apostles, as having been
spoken in censure to the people, “Which of the prophets did not your
fathers persecute, who showed before of the coming of the Righteous
one?” <span id="fr_5272"></span>[5273](#fn_5272)   And by Paul in the
First Epistle to the Thessalonians like things are said:  “For ye
brethren became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judæa in
Christ Jesus, for ye also suffered the same things of your own
countrymen even as they did of the Jews, who both killed the Lord Jesus
and the prophets, and drave out us, and please not God, and are contrary
to all men.” <span id="fr_5273"></span>[5274](#fn_5273)   A prophet,
then, is not without honour among the Gentiles; for either they do not
know him at all, or, having learned and received him as a prophet, they
honour him.  And such are those who are of the Church.  Prophets suffer
dishonour, first, when they are persecuted, according to historical
fact, by the people, and, secondly, when their prophecy is not believed
by the people.  For if they had believed Moses and the prophets they
would have believed Christ, who showed that when men believed Moses and
the prophets, belief in Christ logically followed, and that when men did
not believe Christ they did not believe Moses. <span
id="fr_5274"></span>[5275](#fn_5274)   Moreover, as by the transgression
of the law he who sins is said to dishonour God, so by not believing in
that which is prophesied the prophet is dishonoured by the man who
disbelieves the prophecies.  And so far as the literal truth is
concerned, it is useful to recount what things Jeremiah suffered among
the people in relation to which he said, “And I said, I will not speak,
nor will I call upon the name of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_5275"></span>[5276](#fn_5275)   And again, elsewhere, “I was
continually being mocked.” <span id="fr_5276"></span>[5277](#fn_5276)  
And how great sufferings he endured from the then king of Israel are
written in his prophecy.  And it is also written that some of the people
often came to stone Moses to death; for his fatherland was not the
stones of any place, but the people who followed him, among whom also he
was dishonoured.  And Isaiah is reported to have been sawn asunder by
the people; and if any one does not accept the statement because of its
being found in the Apocryphal Isaiah, <span
id="fr_5277"></span>[5278](#fn_5277) let him believe what is written
thus in the Epistle to the Hebrews, “They were stoned, they were sawn
asunder, they were tempted;” <span id="fr_5278"></span>[5279](#fn_5278)
for the expression, “They were sawn asunder,” refers to Isaiah, just as
the words, “They were slain with the sword,” refer to Zacharias, who was
slain “between the sanctuary and the altar,” <span
id="fr_5279"></span>[5280](#fn_5279) as the Saviour taught, bearing
testimony, as I think, to a Scripture, though not extant in the common
and widely circulated books, but perhaps in apocryphal books.  And they,
too, were dishonoured in their own country among the Jews who went about
“in sheep-skins, in goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted,” and so
on; <span id="fr_5280"></span>[5281](#fn_5280) “For all that will to
live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.” <span
id="fr_5281"></span>[5282](#fn_5281)   And probably because Paul knew
this, <span id="page_426">p. 426</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xviii-Page_426"></span>“That a prophet has no honour in
his own country,” though he preached the Word in many places he did not
preach it in Tarsus.  And the Apostles on this account left Israel and
did that which had been enjoined on them by the Saviour, “Make disciples
of all the nations,” <span id="fr_5282"></span>[5283](#fn_5282) and, “Ye
shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judæa and Samaria,
and unto the uttermost part of the earth.” <span
id="fr_5283"></span>[5284](#fn_5283)   For they did that which had been
commanded them in Judæa and Jerusalem; but, since a prophet has no
honour in his own country, when the Jews did not receive the Word, they
went away to the Gentiles.  Consider, too, if, because of the fact that
the saying, “I will pour forth of My Spirit upon all flesh, and they
shall prophesy,” <span id="fr_5284"></span>[5285](#fn_5284) has been
fulfilled in the churches from the Gentiles, you can say that those
formerly of the world and who by believing became no longer of the
world, having received the Holy Spirit in their own country—that is, the
world—and prophesying, have not honour, but are dishonoured.  Wherefore
blessed are they who suffer the same things as the prophets, according
to what was said by the Saviour, “For in the same manner did their
fathers unto the prophets.” <span id="fr_5285"></span>[5286](#fn_5285)  
Now if any one who attends carefully to these things be hated and
attacked, because of his living with rigorous austerity, and his reproof
of sinners, as a man who is persecuted and reproached for the sake of
righteousness, he will not only not be grieved, but will rejoice and be
exceeding glad, being assured that, because of these things, he has
great reward in heaven from Him who likened him to the prophets on the
ground of his having suffered the same things.  Therefore, he who
zealously imitates the prophetic life, and attains to the spirit which
was in them, must be dishonoured in the world, and in the eyes of
sinners, to whom the life of the righteous man is a burden.
