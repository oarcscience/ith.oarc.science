<span id="xv.iii.i.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xxxii-p1.1"></span>32.  Christ as Son.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xxxii-p2"></span>None of these testimonies, however,
sets forth distinctly the Saviour’s exalted birth; but when the words
are addressed to Him, “Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten
Thee,” <span id="fr_4607"></span>[4608](#fn_4607) this is spoken to Him
by God, with whom all time is to-day, for there is no evening with God,
as I consider, and there is no morning, nothing but time that stretches
out, along with His unbeginning and unseen life.  The day is to-day with
Him in which the Son was begotten, and thus the beginning of His birth
is not found, as neither is the day of it.
