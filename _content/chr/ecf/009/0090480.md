<span id="xvi.ii.vii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.vii-p1.1"></span>7.  Exposition Continued:  the King and
the Servants.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.vii-p2"></span>“*The kingdom of heaven,*” He says,
“*is likened,*” <span id="fr_6077"></span>[6078](#fn_6077) etc.  But if
it be likened to such a king, and one who has done such things, who must
we say that it is but the Son of God?  For He is the King of the
heavens, and as He is absolute Wisdom and absolute Righteousness and
absolute Truth, is He not so also absolute Kingdom?  But it is not a
kingdom of any of those below, nor of a part of those above, but of all
the things above, which were called heavens.  But if you enquire into
the meaning of the words, “Theirs is the kingdom of heaven,” <span
id="fr_6078"></span>[6079](#fn_6078) you may say that Christ is theirs
in so far as He is absolute Kingdom, reigning in every thought of the
man who is no longer under the reign of sin which reigns in the mortal
body of those who have subjected themselves to it. <span
id="fr_6079"></span>[6080](#fn_6079)   And if I say, reigning in every
thought, I mean something like this, reigning as Righteousness and
Wisdom and Truth and the rest of the virtues in him who has become a
heaven, because of bearing the image of the heavenly, and in every
power, whether angelic, or the rest that are named saints, not only in
this age, but also in that which is to come, and who are worthy of a
kingdom of such a kind.  Accordingly this kingdom of heaven (when it was
made “in the likeness of sinful flesh,” <span
id="fr_6080"></span>[6081](#fn_6080) that for sin it might condemn sin,
when God made “Him who knew no sin to be sin on behalf of us,” <span
id="fr_6081"></span>[6082](#fn_6081) who bear the body of our sin), is
likened to a certain king who is understood in relation to Jesus being
united to Him, if we may dare so to speak, having more capacity towards
being united and becoming entirely one with the “First-born of all
creation,” <span id="fr_6082"></span>[6083](#fn_6082) than he, who,
being joined to the Lord, becomes one spirit with Him. <span
id="fr_6083"></span>[6084](#fn_6083)   Now of this kingdom of the
heavens which is likened unto a certain king, according to the
conception of Jesus, and is united to Him, it is said by anticipation
that he wished to make a reckoning with his servants.  But he is about
to make a reckoning with them in order that it may be manifested how
each has employed the tried money of the householder and his rational
coins.  And the image in the parables was indeed taken from masters who
made a reckoning with their own servants; but we shall understand more
accurately what is signified by this part of the parable, if we fix our
thought on the things done by the slaves who had administered their
master’s goods, and who were asked to give a reckoning concerning them. 
For each of them, receiving in different measure from his master’s
goods, has used them either for that which was right so as to increase
the goods of his master, or consumed it riotously on things which he
ought not, and spent profusely without judgment and without discretion
that which had been put into his hands.  But there are those who have
wisely administered these goods and goods so great, but have lost
others, and whenever they give the reckoning when the master makes a
reckoning with them, there is gathered together how much loss each has
incurred, and there is reckoned up how much gain each has brought, and
according to the worthiness of the way in which he has administered it,
he is either honoured or punished, or in some cases the debt is
forgiven, but in others the talents are taken away.  Well, then, from
what has been said, let us <span id="page_499">p. 499</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vii.vii-Page_499"></span>first look at the rational coins and
the tried money of the householder, of which one receives more and
another less, for according to the ability of each, to one are given
five talents as he has the ability to administer so many, but to another
two as not being able to receive the amount of the man before him, and
to another one as being also inferior to the second. <span
id="fr_6084"></span>[6085](#fn_6084)   Are these, then, the only
differences, or are we to recognize these differences in the case of
certain persons of whom the Gospel goes on to speak while there are also
others besides these:  In other parables also are found certain persons,
as the two debtors, the one who owed five hundred pence, and the other
fifty; <span id="fr_6085"></span>[6086](#fn_6085) but whether these had
been entrusted with them and had administered them badly as being
inferior in ability to him who had been entrusted with a talent, or had
received them, we have not learned; but that they owed so much, we seem
to be taught from the parable.  And there are found other ten servants
who were each entrusted with a pound separately. <span
id="fr_6086"></span>[6087](#fn_6086)   And if any one understood the
varied character of the human soul and the wide differences from each
other in respect of natural aptitude, or want of aptitude for more or
fewer of the virtues, and for these virtues or for those, perhaps he
would comprehend how each soul has come with certain coins of the
householder which come to light with the full attainment of reason, and
with the attention which follows the full attainment of reason, and with
exercise in things that are right, or with diligence and exercise in
other things, whether they be useful as pursuits, or in part useful and
in part not useful, such as the opinions which are not wholly true nor
wholly false.
