<span id="xv.iii.i.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xxvi-p1.1"></span>26.  Christ as the Way.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xxvi-p2"></span>But that progress too, which is in
wisdom and which is found by those who seek their salvation in it to do
for them what they require both in respect of exposition of truth in the
divine word and in respect of conduct according to true righteousness,
it lets us understand how Christ is the way.  In this way we have to
take nothing with us, <span id="fr_4594"></span>[4595](#fn_4594) neither
wallet nor coat; we must travel without even a stick, nor must we have
shoes on our feet.  For this road is itself sufficient for all the
supplies of our journey; and every one who walks on it wants nothing. 
He is clad with a garment which is fit for one who is setting out in
response to an invitation to a wedding; and on this road he cannot meet
anything that can annoy him.  “No one,” Solomon says, <span
id="fr_4595"></span>[4596](#fn_4595) “can find out the way of a serpent
upon a <span id="page_313">p. 313</span> <span
id="xv.iii.i.xxvi-Page_313"></span>rock.”  I would add, or that of any
other beast.  Hence there is no need of a staff on this road, on which
there is no trace of any hostile creature, and the hardness of which,
whence also it is called rock (*petra*), makes it incapable of
harbouring anything hurtful.
