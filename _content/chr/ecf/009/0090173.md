id="xii.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—We Ought to Serve God, Trusting
in His Promises.</span>

<span id="xii.vi.xi-p2"></span>Let us therefore serve God with a pure
heart, and we shall be righteous; but if we do not serve Him, because we
believe not the promise of God, we shall be miserable.  For the
prophetic word also declares, “Wretched are those of a double mind, and
who doubt in their heart, who say, All these things <span
id="fr_4385"></span>[4386](#fn_4385) have we heard even in the times of
our fathers; but though we have waited day by day, we have seen none of
them \[accomplished\].  Ye fools! compare yourselves to a tree; take,
for instance, the vine.  First of all it sheds its leaves, then the bud
appears; after that the sour grape, and then the fully-ripened fruit. 
So, likewise, my people have borne disturbances and afflictions, but
afterwards shall they receive their good things.” <span
id="fr_4386"></span>[4387](#fn_4386)   Wherefore, my brethren, let us
not be of a double mind, but let us hope and endure, that we also may
obtain the reward.  For He is faithful who has promised that He will
bestow on every one a reward according to his works.  If, therefore, we
shall do righteousness in the sight of God, we shall enter into His
kingdom, and shall receive the promises, which “ear hath not heard, nor
eye seen, neither have entered into the heart of man.” <span
