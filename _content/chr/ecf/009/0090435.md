id="xvi.ii.v.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>38.  The Garments White as the
Light.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xxxviii-p2"></span>And not only is He transfigured
before such disciples, nor does He only add to the transfiguration the
shining of His face as the sun; but further also to those who were led
up by Him into the high mountain apart, His garments appear white as the
light. <span id="fr_5783"></span>[5784](#fn_5783)   But the garments of
Jesus are the expressions and letters of the Gospels with which He
invested Himself.  But I think that even the words in the Apostles which
indicate the truths concerning Him are garments of Jesus, which become
white to those who go up into the high mountain along with Jesus.  But
since there are differences also of things white, His garments become
white as the brightest and purest of all white things; and that is
light.  When therefore you see any one not only with a thorough
understanding of the theology concerning Jesus, but also making clear
every expression of the Gospels, do not hesitate to say that to Him the
garments of Jesus have become white as the light.  But when the Son of
God in His transfiguration is so understood and beheld, that His face is
a sun, and His garments white as the light, straightway there will
appear to him who beholds Jesus in such form Moses,—the law—and
Elijah,—in the way of synecdoche, not one prophet only, but all the
prophets—holding converse with Jesus; for such is the force of the words
“talking with Him;” <span id="fr_5784"></span>[5785](#fn_5784) but,
according to Luke, “Moses and Elijah appeared in glory,” down to the
words, “in Jerusalem.” <span id="fr_5785"></span>[5786](#fn_5785)   But
if any one sees the glory of Moses, having understood the spiritual law
as a discourse in harmony with Jesus, and the wisdom in the prophets
which is hidden in a mystery, <span id="fr_5786"></span>[5787](#fn_5786)
he sees Moses and Elijah in glory when he sees them with Jesus.
