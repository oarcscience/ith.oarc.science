<span id="viii.i-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.i-p5.1"></span>The</span> translation is from Mr. M. R. James’s
text in *Texts and Studies*, ii. 3, p. 130ff., published from a
fifteenth century <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.i-p5.2"></span>ms.</span> in the Bodleian Library.  The
original, Mr. James conjecturally assigns to the tenth or eleventh
century.  It is notable for its close resemblance in several passages to
4 Esdras, to the Greek original of which the author seems to have had
direct access.

<span id="viii.i-p6"></span>Like the Apocalypse of Esdras it deals with
the subject of intercession for sinners and the reluctance of the seer
to die.  The parallel passages in 4 Esdras and the Apocalypse of Esdras
are pointed out in the margin of the translation.

<span id="viii.i-p7"></span>Chapter I. consists of a few lines from the
beginning and end of a homily on love which appears in the <span
class="sc"><span id="viii.i-p7.1"></span>ms.</span> at the beginning of
the Apocalypse, but which Mr. James regards as “quite unimportant and
quite irrelevant.”
