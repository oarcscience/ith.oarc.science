<p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.vii.xi-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.vii.xi-p1.1"></A>11.&#160; The Servant Who Owed a Hundred Pence.</span></p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.vii.xi-p2"></A>Only, though he cannot pay the talents, for he has lost them, he has a wife and children and other things, of which it is written, &#8220;All that he has.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6110"></A><A HREF="#fn_6110"><FONT SIZE="1">6111</FONT></A>
&#160; And it was possible that when he had been sold along with his own, he would have prospered if some one had bought him, and, by his worth and the things that were his, have paid the whole debt in full; and it was possible that he might no longer be the servant of the king, but become that of his purchaser.&#160; And he makes a request that he be not sold along with his own, but may continue to abide in the house of the king; wherefore he fell down and worshipped him, knowing that the king was God, and said, &#8220;Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6111"></A><A HREF="#fn_6111"><FONT SIZE="1">6112</FONT></A>
 for he was, as is probable, an active man, who knew that he could by a second course of action fill up the whole deficiency of the former loss of many talents.&#160; And this truly good king was moved with compassion for the man who owed him many talents and then released him, having bestowed upon him a favour greater than the request which had been made; for the debtor promised to the long-suffering master to pay all his debts, but the Lord moved with compassion for him did not merely forgive him with the idea of receiving his own back as a result of his patience, but even entirely released him and forgave him the whole debt.&#160; But this wicked servant, who had besought his master to have patience for his many talents, acted without mercy, for, having found one of his fellow-servants which owed him a hundred pence, he laid hold on him and took him by the throat, saying, &#8220;Pay if thou owest.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6112"></A><A HREF="#fn_6112"><FONT SIZE="1">6113</FONT></A>
&#160; And did he not exhibit the very excess of wickedness who laid hold of his fellow-servant for a hundred pence, and took him by the throat and deprived him of freedom to breathe, when he himself, for the many talents, had neither been laid hold of, nor seized by the throat, but at first was ordered to be sold along with his wife and children and all that was his own; but afterwards, when he had worshipped him, the master was moved with compassion for him, and he was released and forgiven in regard to the whole of the debt.&#160; But it were indeed a hard task to tell according to the conception of Jesus who is the one fellow-servant who was found to be owing a hundred pence, not to his own lord, but to him who owed many talents, and who are the fellow-servants who saw the one taking by the throat, and the other taken, and were exceedingly sorry, and represented clearly unto their own lord all that had been done.&#160; But what the truth in these matters is, I declare that no one can interpret unless Jesus, who explained all things to His own disciples privately, takes up His abode in his reason, and opens up all the treasures in the parable which are dark, hidden, unseen, and confirms by clear demonstrations the man whom He desires to illumine with the light of the knowledge of the things that are in this parable, that he may at once represent who is brought to the king as the debtor of many talents, and who is the other one who owes to him a hundred pence, etc.; whether he can be the man of sin previously mentioned,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6113"></A><A HREF="#fn_6113"><FONT SIZE="1">6114</FONT></A>
 or the devil, or neither of these, but some other, whether a man, or some one of these under the sway of the devil; for it is a work of the wisdom of God to exhibit the things that have been prophesied concerning those who are in themselves of a certain nature, or have been made according to such and such qualities, whether among visible powers or also among some men, in whatever way they may have been written by the Holy Spirit.&#160; But as we have not yet received the competent mind which is able to be blended with the mind of Christ, and which is capable of attaining to things so great, and which is able with the Spirit to &#8220;search all things, even the deep things of God,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6114"></A><A HREF="#fn_6114"><FONT SIZE="1">6115</FONT></A>
 we, forming an impression still indefinitely with regard to the matters in this passage, are of opinion that the wicked servant indicated by the parable who is here represented in regard to the debt of many talents, refers to some definite one.</p>
