<span id="xv.iii.iv.i-p4"></span>You are not content to fulfil the
office, when I am present with you, of a taskmaster to drive me to
labour at theology; even when I am absent you demand that I should spend
most of my time on you and on the task I have to do for you. <span
id="fr_4782"></span>[4783](#fn_4782)   I, for my part, am inclined to
shrink from toil, and to avoid that danger which threatens from God
those who give themselves to writing on divinity; thus I would take
shelter in Scripture in refraining from making many books.  For Solomon
says in Ecclesiastes, <span id="fr_4783"></span>[4784](#fn_4783) “My
son, beware of making many books; there is no end of it, and much study
is a weariness of the flesh.”  For we, except that text have some hidden
meaning which we do not yet perceive, have directly transgressed the
injunction, we have not guarded ourselves against making many books.

discussion of but a few sentences of the Gospel have run to four
volumes, he goes on:*\]
