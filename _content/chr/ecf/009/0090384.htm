<p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.iv.vii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.iv.vii-p1.1"></A>7.&#160; The Healing of the Sick on the Other Side.&#160; The Method of Healing.</span></p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.iv.vii-p2"></A>But after this both Jesus and Peter will go up into the boat, and the wind will cease; and those in the boat, perceiving the great dangers from which they have been saved, will worship Him, saying, not simply, &#8220;Thou art the Son of God,&#8221; as also the two demoniacs said, but, &#8220;Of a truth, Thou art the Son of God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5394"></A><A HREF="#fn_5394"><FONT SIZE="1">5395</FONT></A>
&#160; This the disciples in the boat say, for I do not think that others than the disciples said so.&#160; And when we have undergone all these experiences, having crossed over, we shall come to the land where Jesus commanded us to go before Him. &#160;And perhaps, also, some secret and occult mystery with reference to some who were saved by Jesus is indicated by the words, &#8220;And when the men of that place knew Him,&#8221;&#8212;plainly of the place on the other side,&#8212;&#8220;they sent into all that region round about,&#8221;&#8212;round about the other side, not on the other side itself, but round about it,&#8212;&#8220;and they brought unto Him all that were sick.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5395"></A><A HREF="#fn_5395"><FONT SIZE="1">5396</FONT></A>
&#160; And here observe that they brought unto Him not only many that were sick, but all in that region round about; and the sick who were brought to Him besought Him that they might touch if it were only the border of His garment,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5396"></A><A HREF="#fn_5396"><FONT SIZE="1">5397</FONT></A>
 beseeching this grace from Him, since they were not like &#8220;the woman who had an issue of blood twelve years, and who came behind Him and touched the border of His garment, saying within herself, If I do but touch His garment, I shall be made whole.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5397"></A><A HREF="#fn_5397"><FONT SIZE="1">5398</FONT></A>
&#160; For observe in what is said about the border of His garment, on account of what the flowing of her blood ceased at once.&#160; But those from the country round the land of Gennesaret, to which Jesus and His disciples crossed over and came, did not come of themselves to Jesus, but were brought by those who had sent the tidings, inasmuch as they were not able because of their extreme weakness to come of themselves.&#160; Nor did they merely touch the garment, like the woman who had an issue of blood, but they touched after that they had besought Him.&#160; Only, of these, &#8220;as many as touched were made whole.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5398"></A><A HREF="#fn_5398"><FONT SIZE="1">5399</FONT></A>
&#160; And whether there be any difference between the &#8220;They were made whole,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5399"></A><A HREF="#fn_5399"><FONT SIZE="1">5400</FONT></A>
 which is said in their case, and the &#8220;being saved,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5400"></A><A HREF="#fn_5400"><FONT SIZE="1">5401</FONT></A>
&#8212;for it was said to the woman with the issue of blood, &#8220;Thy faith hath saved thee,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5401"></A><A HREF="#fn_5401"><FONT SIZE="1">5402</FONT></A>
