<span id="xv.iii.i.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>33.  Christ the True Vine, and as
Bread.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xxxiii-p2"></span>To what we have said must be added
how the Son is the true vine.  Those will have no difficulty in
apprehending this who understand, in a manner worthy of the prophetic
grace, the saying: <span id="fr_4608"></span>[4609](#fn_4608)   “Wine
maketh glad the heart of man.”  For if the heart be the intellectual
part, and what rejoices it is the Word most pleasant of all to drink
which takes us off human things, makes us feel ourselves inspired, and
intoxicates us with an intoxication which is not irrational but divine,
that, I conceive, with which Joseph made his brethren merry, <span
id="fr_4609"></span>[4610](#fn_4609) then it is very clear how He who
brings wine thus to rejoice the heart of man is the *true* vine.  He is
the true vine, because the grapes He bears are the truth, the disciples
are His branches, and they, also, bring forth the truth as their fruit. 
It is somewhat difficult to show the difference between the vine and
bread, for He says, not only that He is the vine, but that He is the
bread of life.  May it be that as bread nourishes and makes strong, and
is said to strengthen the heart of man, but wine, on the contrary,
pleases and rejoices and melts him, so ethical studies, bringing life to
him who learns them and reduces them to practice, are the bread of life,
but cannot properly be called the fruit of the vine, while secret and
mystical speculations, rejoicing the heart and causing those to feel
inspired who take them in, delighting in the Lord, and who desire not
only to be nourished but to be made happy, are called the juice of the
true vine, because they flow from it.
