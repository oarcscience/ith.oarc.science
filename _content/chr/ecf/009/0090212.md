<span id="xv.iii.i.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.i.xvi-p1.1"></span>16.  Meaning of “Beginning.”  (1) in
Space.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i.xvi-p2"></span>“*In the beginning was the
Word.*” <span id="fr_4527"></span>[4528](#fn_4527)   It is not only the
Greeks who consider the word “beginning” to have many meanings.  Let any
one collect the Scripture passages in which the word occurs, and with a
view to an accurate interpretation of it note what it stands for in each
passage, and he will find that the word has many meanings in sacred
discourse also.  We speak of a beginning in reference to a transition. 
Here it has to do with a road and with length.  This appears in the
saying: <span id="fr_4528"></span>[4529](#fn_4528)   “The beginning of a
good way is to do justice.”  For since the good way is long, there have
first to be considered in reference to it the question connected with
action, and this side is presented in the words “to do justice;” the
contemplative side comes up for consideration afterwards.  In the latter
the end of it comes to rest at last in the so-called restoration of all
things, since no enemy is left them to fight against, if that be true
which is said: <span id="fr_4529"></span>[4530](#fn_4529)   “For He must
reign until He have placed His enemies under His feet.  But the last
enemy to be destroyed is death.”  For then but one activity will be left
for those who have come to God on account of His word which is with Him,
that, namely, of <span id="page_306">p. 306</span> <span
id="xv.iii.i.xvi-Page_306"></span>knowing God, so that, being found by
the knowledge of the Father, they may all be His Son, as now no one but
the Son knows the Father.  For should any one enquire carefully at what
time those are to know the Father to whom He who knows the Father
reveals Him, and should he consider how a man now sees only through a
glass and in a riddle, never having learned to know as he ought to know,
he would be justified in saying that no one, no apostle even, and no
prophet had known the Father, but when he became one with Him as a son
and a father are one.  And if any one says that it is a digression which
has led us to this point, our consideration of that one meaning of the
word beginning, we must show that the digression is necessary and useful
for the end we have in view.  For if we speak of a beginning in the case
of a transition, and of a way and its length, and if we are told that
the beginning of a good way is to do justice, then it concerns us to
know in what manner every good way has for its beginning to do justice,
and how after such beginning it arrives at contemplation, and in what
manner it thus arrives at contemplation.
