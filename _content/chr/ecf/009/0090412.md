<span id="xvi.ii.v.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xv-p1.1"></span>15.  Relation of the Former Commission
Given by Jesus to the Disciples, to His Present Injunction of Silence. 
Belief and Knowledge Contrasted.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xv-p2"></span>“*Then enjoined He His disciples that
they should tell no man that He was the Christ.*” <span
id="fr_5660"></span>[5661](#fn_5660)   It is written above that Jesus
sent forth these twelve saying unto them, “Go not into any way of the
Gentiles,” <span id="fr_5661"></span>[5662](#fn_5661) and the other
words which are recorded to have been said to them when He sent them to
the apostleship.  Did He then wish them when they were already
discharging the function of Apostles to proclaim that He was the
Christ?  For, if He wished it, it is fitting to inquire why He now at
all commands the disciples that they should not say that He was the
Christ?  Or if He did not wish it, how can the things concerning the
apostleship be safely maintained?  And these things also one may inquire
at this place,—whether, when He sent away the Twelve, He did not send
them away with the understanding that He was the Christ?  But if the
Twelve had such understanding, manifestly Peter had it also; how, then,
is he now pronounced blessed?  For the expression here plainly indicates
that now for the first time Peter confessed that Christ was the Son of
the living God.  Matthew then, according to some of the manuscripts, has
written, “Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no man
that He was the Christ,” but <span id="fr_5662"></span>[5663](#fn_5662)
Mark says, “He charged them that they should tell no man of Him;” <span
id="fr_5663"></span>[5664](#fn_5663) and Luke, “He charged them and
commanded them to tell this to no man.” <span
id="fr_5664"></span>[5665](#fn_5664)   But what is the “this”?  Was it
that also according to him, Peter answered and said to the question,
“Who say ye that I am.”—“The Christ, the Son of the living God?” <span
id="fr_5665"></span>[5666](#fn_5665)   You must know, however, that some
manuscripts of the Gospel according to Matthew have, “He charged.” <span
id="fr_5666"></span>[5667](#fn_5666)   The difficulty thus started seems
to me a very real difficulty; but let a solution which cannot be
impugned be sought out, and let the finder of it bring it forward before
all, if it be more credible than that which shall be advanced by us as a
fairly temperate view. <span id="fr_5667"></span>[5668](#fn_5667)  
Consider, then, if you can say, that the belief that Jesus is the Christ
is inferior to the knowledge of that which is believed.  And perhaps
also there is a difference in the knowledge of Jesus as the Christ, as
every one who knows does not know Him alike.  From the words in John,
“If ye abide in My word, ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall
make you free,” <span id="fr_5668"></span>[5669](#fn_5668) it is plain
that belief without knowledge is inferior to knowing; but that there is
a difference in the knowledge of Jesus as the Christ, as all who know
Him do not know Him equally, is a fact self-evident to any one who gives
even a very little consideration to the matter.  For who would not
acknowledge, for example, that Timothy, though he knew that Jesus was
the Christ, had not been enlightened to such an extent in the knowledge
of Him as the Apostle had been enlightened?  And who would not also
admit this—that though many, speaking the <span id="page_460">p.
460</span> <span id="xvi.ii.v.xv-Page_460"></span>truth, say about God,
“He has given to me a true knowledge of things that are,” yet they will
not say this with equal insight and apprehension of the things known,
nor as knowing the same number of things?  But it is not only in respect
of the difference of knowing that those who know do not know alike, but
also according to that which is the source of the knowledge; so that
according to this he who knows the Son by the revelation of the
Father, <span id="fr_5669"></span>[5670](#fn_5669) as Peter is testified
to have known, has the highest beatitude.  Now, if these views of ours
are sound, you will consider whether the Twelve formerly believed but
did not know; but, after believing, they gained also the rudiments of
knowledge and knew a few things about Him; and afterwards they continued
to advance in knowledge so that they were able to receive the knowledge
from the Father who reveals the Son; in which position Peter was, when
he was pronounced blessed; for also he is pronounced blessed not merely
because he said, “Thou art the Christ,” but with the addition, “the Son
of the living God.”  Accordingly Mark and Luke who have recorded that
Peter answered and said, “Thou art the Christ,” but have not given the
addition found in Matthew, have not recorded that he was declared
blessed for what had been said, nor the blessing which followed the
declaration of blessedness, “Thou art Peter,” <span
