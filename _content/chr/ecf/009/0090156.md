id="xii.iv.lxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXI.—Prayer Continued—For Rulers and
Governors.  Conclusion.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.lxi-p2"></span>To our rulers and governors on the
earth—to them Thou, Lord, gavest the power of the kingdom by Thy
glorious and ineffable might, to the end that we may know the glory and
honour given to them by Thee and be subject to them, in nought resisting
Thy will; to them, Lord, give health, peace, concord, stability, that
they may exercise the authority given to them without offence.  For
Thou, O heavenly Lord and King eternal, givest to the sons of men glory
and honour and power over the things that are on the earth; do Thou,
Lord, direct their counsel according to that which is good and
well-pleasing in Thy sight, that, devoutly in peace and meekness
exercising the power given them by Thee, they may find Thee propitious. 
O Thou, who only hast power to do these things and more abundant good
with us, we praise Thee through the High Priest and Guardian of our
souls Jesus Christ, through whom be glory and majesty to Thee both now
and from generation to generation and for evermore.  Amen.
