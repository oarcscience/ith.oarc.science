<p class="c12"><a name="xii.vi.xix-p2"></A>So then, brothers and sisters,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4408"></A><A HREF="#fn_4408"><FONT SIZE="1">4409</FONT></A>
 after the God of truth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4409"></A><A HREF="#fn_4409"><FONT SIZE="1">4410</FONT></A>
 I address to you an appeal that ye may give heed to the words written,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4410"></A><A HREF="#fn_4410"><FONT SIZE="1">4411</FONT></A>
 that ye may save both yourselves and him who reads an address in your midst.&#160; For as a reward I ask of you repentance with the whole heart, while ye bestow upon yourselves salvation and life.&#160; For by so doing we shall set a mark for all the young who wish to be diligent in godliness and the goodness of God.&#160; And let not us, in our folly, feel displeasure and indignation, whenever any one admonishes us and turns us from unrighteousness to righteousness.&#160; For there are some wicked deeds which we commit, and know it not, because of the double-mindedness and unbelief present in our breasts, and our understanding is darkened by vain desires.&#160; Let us, therefore, work righteousness, that we may be saved to the end.&#160; Blessed are they who obey these commandments, even if for a brief space they suffer in this world, and they will gather the imperishable fruit of the resurrection.&#160; Let not the godly man, therefore, grieve; if for the present he suffer affliction, blessed is the time that awaits him there; rising up to life again with the fathers he will rejoice for ever without a grief.</p>
