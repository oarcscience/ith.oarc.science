<span id="xv.iii.ii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.ii.xxix-p1.1"></span>29.  The Six Testimonies of the Baptist
Enumerated.  Jesus’ “Come and See.”  Significance of the Tenth
Hour.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ii.xxix-p2"></span>Accordingly John came to bear
witness of the light, and in his witness-bearing he cried, saying, <span
id="fr_4766"></span>[4767](#fn_4766) “He that cometh after me exists
before me; for He was before me; for of His fulness we have all received
and grace for grace, for the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth
came through Jesus Christ.  No one hath seen God at any time; the
only-begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared
Him.”  This whole speech is from the mouth of the Baptist bearing
witness to the Christ.  Some take it otherwise, and consider that the
words from “for of His fulness” to “He hath declared Him” are from the
writer, John the Apostle.  The true state of the case is that John’s
first testimony begins, as we said before, “He that cometh after me,”
and ends, “He hath declared Him,” and his second testimony is that
spoken to the priests and levites sent from Jerusalem, whom the Jews had
sent.  To them he confesses and does not deny the truth, namely, that he
is not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet, but “the voice of one
crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as saith
Isaiah the prophet.” <span id="fr_4767"></span>[4768](#fn_4767)   After
this there is another testimony of the same Baptist to Christ, still
teaching His superior nature, which goes forth into the whole world and
enters into reasonable souls.  He says, <span
id="fr_4768"></span>[4769](#fn_4768) “There standeth One among you whom
you know not, even He that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I
am not worthy to unloose.”  Consider if, since the heart is in the
middle of the whole body, and the ruling principle in the heart, the
saying, “There standeth One among you whom you know not,” can be
understood of <span id="fr_4769"></span>[4770](#fn_4769) the reason
which is in every man.  John’s fourth testimony of Christ after these
points to His human sufferings.  He says, <span
id="fr_4770"></span>[4771](#fn_4770) “Behold the Lamb of God, which
taketh away the sin of the world.  This is He of whom I said, After me
cometh a man who exists before me, for He was before me.  And I knew Him
not, but that He should be made <span id="page_344">p. 344</span> <span
id="xv.iii.ii.xxix-Page_344"></span>manifest to Israel, therefore am I
come baptizing with water.”  And the fifth testimony is recorded in the
words, <span id="fr_4771"></span>[4772](#fn_4771) “I beheld the Spirit
descending as a dove out of heaven, and it abode upon Him, and I knew
Him not, but He that sent me to baptize with water, He said unto me,
Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon
Him, the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit.  And I have
seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God.”  In the sixth place
John witnesses of Christ to the two disciples: <span
id="fr_4772"></span>[4773](#fn_4772)   “He looked on Jesus as He walked
and saith, Behold the Lamb of God.”  After this testimony the two
disciples who heard it followed Jesus; and Jesus turned and beheld them
following, and saith unto them, “What seek ye?”  Perhaps it is not
without significance that after six testimonies John ceases from his
witness-bearing and Jesus brings forward in the seventh place His “What
seek ye?”  Very becoming in those who have been helped by John’s
testimony is the speech in which they address Christ as their Master,
and declare their wish to see the dwelling of the Son of God; for they
say to Him, “Rabbi,” which answers to “Master,” in our language, “where
dwellest Thou?”  And since every one that seeketh findeth, when John’s
disciples seek Jesus’ dwelling, Jesus shows it to them, saying, “Come
and see.”  By the word “Come” He exhorts them perhaps to the practical
part of life, while the “see” is to suggest to them that that
speculation which comes in the train of right conduct will be vouchsafed
to those who desire it; in Jesus’ dwelling they will have it.  After
they had asked where Jesus dwells, and had followed the Master and had
seen, they desired to stay with Him and to spend that day with the Son
of God.  Now the number ten is a sacred one, not a few mysteries being
indicated by it; and so we are to understand that the mention of the
tenth hour as that at which these disciples turned in with Jesus, is not
without significance.  Of these disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon
Peter, is one; and he having profited by this day with Jesus and having
found his own brother Simon (perhaps he had not found him before), told
him that he had found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, Christ. 
It is written that “he that seeketh findeth.”  Now he had sought where
Jesus dwelt, and had followed Him and looked upon His dwelling; he stays
with the Lord “at the tenth hour,” and finds the Son of God, the Word,
and Wisdom, and is ruled by Him as King.  That is why he says, “We have
found the Messiah,” and this a thing which every one can say who has
found this Word of God and is ruled as by a king, by His Divinity.  As a
fruit he at once brings his brother to Christ, and Christ deigned to
look upon Simon, that is to say, by looking at him to visit and
enlighten his ruling principle; and Simon by Jesus’ looking at him was
enabled to grow strong, so as to earn a new name from that work of
firmness and strength, and to be called Peter.
