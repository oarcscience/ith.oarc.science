<span id="xvi.ii.iv.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>6.  Interpretation of the Details in the
Narrative.  Application Thereof to All Disciples.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iv.vi-p2"></span>And then the disciples “*having
crossed over came to the land Gennesaret,*” <span
id="fr_5385"></span>[5386](#fn_5385) of which word, if we knew the
interpretation, we might gain some assistance in the exposition of the
present passage.  And observe, since God is faithful, and will not
suffer the multitudes to be tempted above that they are able, <span
id="fr_5386"></span>[5387](#fn_5386) in what way the Son of God
constrained the disciples to enter into the boat, as being stronger and
able to get as far as the middle of the sea, and to endure the trials by
the waves, until they became worthy of divine assistance, and saw Jesus
and heard Him when He had gone up, and to cross over and come to the
land Gennesaret; but as for the multitudes who, because they were
weaker, did not make trial of the boat and the waves and the contrary
wind, them He sent away, and went up into the mountain apart to
pray. <span id="fr_5387"></span>[5388](#fn_5387)   To pray for whom? 
Was it perhaps to pray for the multitudes that, when they were dismissed
after the loaves of blessing, they might do nothing opposed to their
dismissal by Jesus?  And for the disciples that, when they were
constrained by Him to enter into the boat and to go before Him unto the
other side, they might suffer nothing in the sea nor from the contrary
wind?  And I would say with confidence, that, because of the prayer of
Jesus to the Father for the disciples, they suffered nothing when sea
and wave and contrary wind were striving against them.  The simpler
disciple, then, may be satisfied with the bare narrative; but let us
remember, if ever we fall into distressful temptations, that Jesus has
constrained us to enter into their boat, wishing us to go before Him
unto the other side; for it is not possible for us to reach the other
side, unless we have endured the temptations of waves and contrary
wind.  Then when we see many difficulties besetting us, and with
moderate struggle we have swum through them to some extent, let us
consider that our boat is in the midst of the sea, distressed at that
time by the waves which wish us to make shipwreck concerning faith or
some one of the virtues; but when we see the spirit of the evil one
striving against us, let us conceive that then <span id="page_436">p.
436</span> <span id="xvi.ii.iv.vi-Page_436"></span>the wind is contrary
to us.  When then in such suffering we have spent three watches of the
night—that is, of the darkness which is in the temptations—striving
nobly with all our might and watching ourselves so as not to make
shipwreck concerning the faith or some one of the virtues,—the first
watch against the father of darkness and wickedness, the second watch
against his son “who opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is
called God or thing that is worshipped,” <span
id="fr_5388"></span>[5389](#fn_5388) and the third watch against the
spirit <span id="fr_5389"></span>[5390](#fn_5389) that is opposed to the
Holy Spirit, then we believe that when the fourth watch impendeth, when
“the night is far spent, and the day is at hand,” <span
id="fr_5390"></span>[5391](#fn_5390) the Son of God will come to us,
that He may prepare the sea for us, walking upon it.  And when we see
the Word appearing unto us we shall indeed be troubled before we clearly
understand that it is the Saviour who has come to us, supposing that we
are still beholding an apparition, and for fear shall cry out; but He
Himself straightway will speak to us saying, “Be of good cheer; it is I;
be not afraid.” <span id="fr_5391"></span>[5392](#fn_5391)   And if,
warmly moved by His “Be of good cheer,” any Peter be found among us, who
is on his way to perfection but has not yet become perfect, having gone
down from the boat, as if coming out of that temptation in which he was
distressed, he will indeed walk at first, wishing to come to Jesus upon
the waters; but being as yet of little faith, and as yet doubting, will
see that the wind is strong and will be afraid and begin to sink; but he
will not sink because he will call upon Jesus with loud voice, and will
say to Him, “Lord, save me;” <span id="fr_5392"></span>[5393](#fn_5392)
then immediately while such a Peter is yet speaking and saying, “Lord
save me,” the Word will stretch forth His hand, holding out assistance
to such an one, and will take hold of him when he is beginning to sink,
and will reproach him for his little faith and doubting. <span
id="fr_5393"></span>[5394](#fn_5393)   Only, observe that He did not
say, “O thou without faith,” but, “O thou of little faith,” and that it
was said, “Wherefore didst thou doubt,” as he had still a measure of
faith, but also had a tendency towards that which was opposed to faith.
