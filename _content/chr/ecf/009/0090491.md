<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vii.xviii-p1.1"></span>18.  The Bill of Divorcement.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vii.xviii-p2"></span>After this we will discuss the
saying of the Pharisees which they said to Jesus, “*Why then did Moses
command to give a bill of divorcement and put her away?*” <span
id="fr_6185"></span>[6186](#fn_6185)   And with good reason we will
bring forward for this purpose the passage from Deuteronomy concerning
the bill of divorcement, which is as follows:  “But if a man taketh a
wife and cohabit with her, and it shall be, if she do not find favour in
his sight because he hath found in her a thing unseemly,” etc., down to
the words, “and ye shall not pollute the land which the Lord your God
giveth you for an inheritance.” <span
id="fr_6186"></span>[6187](#fn_6186)   Now I inquire whether in these
things according to this law, we are to seek nothing in it beyond the
letter seeing that God has not given it, or whether to the Pharisees who
quoted the saying, “Moses commanded to give a bill of divorcement and
put her away,” it was of necessity said, “Moses, for your hardness of
heart, suffered you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it
hath not been so.” <span id="fr_6187"></span>[6188](#fn_6187)   But if
any one ascends to the Gospel of Christ Jesus which teaches that the law
is spiritual, he will seek also the spiritual understanding of this
law.  And he who wishes to interpret these things figuratively will say
that, just as it was said by Paul confident in the grace which he had,
“A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth, but if the
husband be dead she is free to be married to whom she will, only in the
Lord; but she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment, and
I think that I also have the Spirit of God” <span
id="fr_6188"></span>[6189](#fn_6188) (for here to the words, “after my
judgment,” lest it should be despised as being without the Spirit of
God, he well added, “and I think that I also have the Spirit of God),”
so also it would be possible for Moses, by reason of the power given to
him to make laws, to the effect that he suffered for the hardness of
heart of the people certain things, among which was the putting away of
wives, to be persuaded in regard to the laws which he promulgated
according to his own judgment, that in these also the legislation took
place with the Spirit of God.  And he will say that, unless one law is
spiritual and another is not such, this is a law, and this is spiritual,
and its spiritual significance ought to be investigated.
