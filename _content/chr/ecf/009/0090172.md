<span id="xii.vi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.vi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Vice is to Be Forsaken, and Virtue
Followed.</span>

<span id="xii.vi.x-p2"></span>Wherefore, my brethren, let us do the will
of the Father who called us, that we may live; and let us
earnestly <span id="fr_4381"></span>[4382](#fn_4381) follow after
virtue, but forsake every wicked tendency <span
id="fr_4382"></span>[4383](#fn_4382) which would lead us into
transgression; and flee from ungodliness, lest evils overtake us.  For
if we are diligent in doing good, peace will follow us.  On this
account, such men cannot find it \[i.e. peace\] as are <span
id="fr_4383"></span>[4384](#fn_4383) influenced by <span
id="page_254">p. 254</span> <span id="xii.vi.x-Page_254"></span>human
terrors, and prefer rather present enjoyment <span
id="fr_4384"></span>[4385](#fn_4384) to the promise which shall
afterwards be fulfilled.  For they know not what torment present
enjoyment incurs, or what felicity is involved in the future promise. 
And if, indeed, they themselves only did such things, it would be \[the
more\] tolerable; but now they persist in imbuing innocent souls with
their pernicious doctrines, not knowing that they shall receive a double
condemnation, both they and those that hear them.
