 night and day until the sabbath.</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p247"></A>28&#160; But the scribes and Pharisees and elders being gathered together one with another, when they heard that all the people murmured and beat their breasts, saying, If by his death these most mighty signs have come to pass, see how just he is,&#8212;29&#160; the elders were afraid and</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p248"></A>came to Pilate, beseeching him and saying, 30&#160; Give us soldiers, that we may guard his sepulchre for three days, lest his disciples come and steal him away, and the people suppose that he is risen from the dead and do us evil.</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p249"></A>31&#160; And Pilate gave them Petronius the centurion with soldiers to guard the tomb.&#160; And with them came the elders and scribes to the sepulchre,</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p250"></A>32&#160; And having rolled a great stone together with the centurion and the soldiers, they all together who were there set it at the door of the sepulchre;</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p251"></A>33&#160; And they affixed seven seals, and they pitched a tent there and guarded it.</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p252"></A>34&#160; And early in the morning as the sabbath was drawing on, there came a multitude from Jerusalem and the region round about, that they might see the sepulchre that was sealed.</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p253"></A>35&#160; And in the night in which the Lord&#146;s day was drawing on, as the soldiers kept guard two by two in a watch, there was a great voice in the heaven; 36 and they saw the heavens opened, and two men descend from thence with great light and approach the tomb.&#160; 37&#160; And that stone which was put at the door rolled of itself and made way in part; and the tomb was opened, and both the young men entered in.</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p254"></A>38&#160; When therefore those soldiers saw it, they awakened the centurion and the elders,&#8212;for they too were hard by keeping guard; 39&#160; and, as they declared what things they had seen, again they see three men coming forth from the tomb, and two of them supporting one, and a cross following them.&#160; 40&#160; And of the two the head reached unto the heaven, but the head of him that was led by them overpassed the heavens.&#160; 41&#160; And they heard a voice from the heavens, saying, Hast thou preached to them that sleep?&#160; 42&#160; And a response was heard from the cross, Yea.</p> 
<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p255"></A>43&#160; They therefore considered one with another whether to go away and shew these things to Pilate.&#160; 44&#160; And while they yet thought thereon, the heavens again are seen to open, and a certain man to descend and enter into the sepulchre.&#160; 45&#160; When the centurion and they that were with him saw these things, they hastened in the night to Pilate, leaving the tomb which they were watching, and declared all things which they had seen, being greatly distressed and saying, Truly he was the Son of God.</p>

<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p285"></A>50&#160; And at dawn upon the Lord&#146;s day, Mary Magdalen, a disciple of the Lord, fearing because of the Jews, since they were burning with wrath, had not done at the Lord&#146;s sepulchre the things which the women are wont to do for those that die and for those that are beloved by them&#8212;</p>

<p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p288"></A>53&#160; But who shall roll away for us the stone that was laid at the door of the sepulchre, that we may enter in and sit by him and do the things that are due?&#160; 54&#160; For the stone was great, and we fear lest some one see us.&#160; And if we cannot, yet if we but set at the door the things which we bring for a memorial of him, we will weep and lament, until we come unto our home.</p>
