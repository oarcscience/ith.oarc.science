<p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.iii.ii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.iii.ii-p1.1"></A>2.&#160; Exposition of the Parable.</span></p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.iii.ii-p2"></A>&#8220;<i>After these things He answered and said to them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man.</i>&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5163"></A><A HREF="#fn_5163"><FONT SIZE="1">5164</FONT></A>
&#160; Though we have already, in previous sections, according to our ability discussed these matters, none the less shall we now say what is in harmony with them, even if there is reasonable ground for another explanation.&#160; And consider now, if in addition to what we have already recounted, you can otherwise take the good seed to be the children of the kingdom, because whatsoever good things are sown in the human soul, these are the offspring of the kingdom of God and have been sown by God the Word who was in the beginning with God,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5164"></A><A HREF="#fn_5164"><FONT SIZE="1">5165</FONT></A>
 so that wholesome words about anything are children of the kingdom.&#160; But while men are asleep who do not act according to the command of Jesus, &#8220;Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5165"></A><A HREF="#fn_5165"><FONT SIZE="1">5166</FONT></A>
 the devil on the watch sows what are called tares&#8212;that is, evil opinions&#8212;over and among what are called by some natural conceptions, even the good seeds which are from the Word.&#160; And according to this the whole world might be called a field, and not the Church of God only, for in the whole world the Son of man sowed the good seed, but the wicked one tares,&#8212;that is, evil words,&#8212;which, springing from wickedness, are children of the evil one.&#160; And at the end of things, which is called &#8220;the consummation of the age,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5166"></A><A HREF="#fn_5166"><FONT SIZE="1">5167</FONT></A>
 there will of necessity be a harvest, in order that the angels of God who have been appointed for this work may gather up the bad opinions that have grown upon the soul, and overturning them may give them over to fire which is said to burn, that they may be consumed.&#160; And so the angels and servants of the Word will gather from all the kingdom of Christ all things that cause a <A NAME="page_415"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 415</FONT></A> <a name="xvi.ii.iii.ii-Page_415"></A>stumbling-block to souls and reasonings that create iniquity, which they will scatter and cast into the burning furnace of fire.&#160; Then those who become conscious that they have received the seeds of the evil one in themselves, because of their having been asleep, shall wail and, as it were, be angry against themselves; for this is the &#8220;gnashing of teeth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5167"></A><A HREF="#fn_5167"><FONT SIZE="1">5168</FONT></A>
&#160; Wherefore, also, in the Psalms it is said, &#8220;They gnashed upon me with their teeth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5168"></A><A HREF="#fn_5168"><FONT SIZE="1">5169</FONT></A>
&#160; Then above all &#8220;shall the righteous shine,&#8221; no longer differently as at the first, but all &#8220;as one sun in the kingdom of their Father.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5169"></A><A HREF="#fn_5169"><FONT SIZE="1">5170</FONT></A>
&#160; Then, as if to indicate that there was indeed a hidden meaning, perhaps, in all that is concerned with the explanation of the parable, perhaps most of all in the saying, &#8220;Then shall the righteous shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father,&#8221; the Saviour adds, &#8220;He that hath ears to hear, let him hear,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5170"></A><A HREF="#fn_5170"><FONT SIZE="1">5171</FONT></A>
 thereby teaching those who think that in the exposition, the parable has been set forth with such perfect clearness that it can be understood by the vulgar,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5171"></A><A HREF="#fn_5171"><FONT SIZE="1">5172</FONT></A>
 that even the things connected with the interpretation of the parable stand in need of explanation.</p>
