<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>20.  Different Conceptions of John the
Baptist.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xx-p2"></span>“*At that season Herod the tetrarch
heard the report concerning Jesus and said unto his own servants, This
is John the Baptist.*” <span id="fr_5298"></span>[5299](#fn_5298)   In
Mark <span id="fr_5299"></span>[5300](#fn_5299) it is the same, and also
in Luke. <span id="fr_5300"></span>[5301](#fn_5300)   The Jews had
different opinions, some false, such as the Sadducees held about the
resurrection of the dead, that they do not rise, and in regard to angels
that they do not exist, but that those things which were written about
them were only to be interpreted figuratively, but had no reality in
point of fact; and some true opinions, such as were taught by the
Pharisees about the resurrection of the dead that they rise.  We must
therefore here inquire, whether the opinion regarding the soul,
mistakenly held by Herod and some from among the people, was somewhat
like this—that John, who a little before had been slain by him, had
risen from the dead after he had been beheaded, and was the same person
under a different name, and being now called Jesus was possessed of the
same powers which formerly wrought in John.  For what credibility is
there in the idea that One, who was so widely known to the whole people,
and whose name was noised abroad in the whole of Judæa, whom they
declared to be the son of the carpenter and Mary, and to have such and
such for brothers and sisters, was thought to be not different
from <span id="fr_5301"></span>[5302](#fn_5301) John whose father was
Zacharias, and whose mother was Elisabeth, who were themselves not
undistinguished among the people?  But it is probable that the fact of
his being the Son of Zacharias was not unknown to the people, who
thought with regard to John that he was truly a prophet, and were so
numerous that the Pharisees, in order to avoid the appearance of saying
that which was displeasing to the people, were afraid to answer the
question, “Was his baptism from heaven or from men?” <span
id="fr_5302"></span>[5303](#fn_5302)   And perhaps, also, to some of
them had come the knowledge of the incident of the vision which was seen
in the temple, when Gabriel appeared to Zacharias.  What credibility,
forsooth, has the erroneous opinion, whether of Herod or of some of the
people, that John and Jesus were not two persons, but that it was one
and the same person John who rose from the dead after that he had been
beheaded and was called Jesus?  Some one might say, however, that Herod
and some of those of the people held the false dogma of the
transmigration of souls into bodies, in consequence of which they
thought that the former John had appeared again by a fresh birth, and
had come from the dead into life as Jesus.  But the time between the
birth of John and the birth of Jesus, which was not more than six
months, does not permit this false opinion to be considered credible. 
And perhaps rather some such idea as this was in the mind of Herod, that
the powers which wrought in John had passed over to Jesus, in
consequence of which He was thought by the people to be John the
Baptist.  And one might use the following line of argument.  Just as
because of the spirit and the power of Elijah, and not because of his
soul, it is said about John, “This is Elijah which is to come,” <span
id="fr_5303"></span>[5304](#fn_5303) the spirit in Elijah and the power
in him having gone over to John—so Herod thought that the powers in John
wrought in his case works of baptism and teaching,—for John did not one
miracle, <span id="fr_5304"></span>[5305](#fn_5304) but in Jesus
miraculous portents.  It may be said that something of this kind was the
thought of those who said that Elijah had appeared in Jesus, or that one
of the old prophets had risen. <span
id="fr_5305"></span>[5306](#fn_5305)   But the opinion of those who said
that Jesus was “a prophet even as one of the prophets,” <span
id="fr_5306"></span>[5307](#fn_5306) has no bearing on the question. 
False, <span id="page_428">p. 428</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xx-Page_428"></span>then, is the saying concerning Jesus,
whether that recorded to have been the view of Herod, or that spoken by
others.  Only, the saying, “That John went before in the spirit and
power of Elijah,” <span id="fr_5307"></span>[5308](#fn_5307) which
corresponds to the thoughts which they were now cherishing concerning
John and Jesus, seems to me more credible.  But since we learned, in the
first place, that when the Saviour after the temptation heard that John
was given up, He retreated into Galilee, and in the second place, that
when John was in prison and heard the things about Jesus he sent two of
his disciples and said to Him, “Art thou He that cometh, or look we for
another?” <span id="fr_5308"></span>[5309](#fn_5308) and in the third
place, generally that Herod said about Jesus, “It is John the Baptist,
he is risen from the dead,” <span id="fr_5309"></span>[5310](#fn_5309)
but we have not previously learned from any quarter the manner in which
the Baptist was killed, therefore Matthew has now recorded it, and Mark
almost like unto him; but Luke passed over in silence the greater part
of the narrative as it is found in them.” <span
id="fr_5310"></span>[5311](#fn_5310)
