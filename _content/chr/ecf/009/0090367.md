<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xvi-p1.1"></span>16.  Parables in Relation to
Similitudes.  Jesus in His Own Country.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.xvi-p2"></span>“*And it came to pass, when Jesus
had finished these parables, He departed thence.  And coming into His
own country.*” <span id="fr_5252"></span>[5253](#fn_5252)   Since we
inquired above whether the things spoken to the multitude were parables,
and those spoken to the disciples were similitudes, and set forth
observations bearing on this in my judgment not contemptible, you must
know that the sentence which is subjoined, “And it came to pass when
Jesus had finished these parables, He departed thence,” will appear to
be in opposition to all these arguments, as applying not only to the
parables, but also to the similitudes as we have expounded.  We inquire
therefore whether all these things are to be rejected, or whether we
must speak of two kinds of parables, those spoken to the multitudes, and
those announced to the disciples; or whether we are to think of the name
of parable as equi-vocal; or whether the saying, “And it came to pass
when Jesus had finished these parables,” is to be referred only to the
parables above, which come before the similitudes.  For, because of the
saying, “To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
heaven, but to the rest in parables,” <span
id="fr_5253"></span>[5254](#fn_5253) it was not possible to say to the
disciples, inasmuch as they were not of those without, that the Saviour
spoke to them in parables.  And it follows from this, that the saying,
“And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed
thence,” is to be referred to the parables spoken above, or that the
name parable is equivocal, or that there are two kinds of parables, or
that these which we have named similitudes were not parables at all. 
And observe that it was outside of His own country He speaks the
parables “which, when He had <span id="page_424">p. 424</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.iii.xvi-Page_424"></span>finished, He departed thence; and
coming into His own country He taught them in their synagogue.”  And
Mark says, “And He came into His own country and His disciples follow
Him.” <span id="fr_5254"></span>[5255](#fn_5254)   We must therefore
inquire whether, by the expression, “His own country,” is meant Nazareth
or Bethlehem,—Nazareth, because of the saying, “He shall be called a
Nazarene,” <span id="fr_5255"></span>[5256](#fn_5255) or Bethlehem,
since in it He was born.  And further I reflect whether the Evangelists
could have said, “coming to Bethlehem,” or, “coming to Nazareth.”  They
have not done so, but have named it “His country,” because of something
being declared in a mystic sense in the passage about His
country,—namely, the whole of Judæa,—in which He was dishonoured
according to the saying, “A prophet is not without honour, save in his
own country.” <span id="fr_5256"></span>[5257](#fn_5256)   And if anyone
thinks of Jesus Christ, “a stumbling-block to the Jews,” <span
id="fr_5257"></span>[5258](#fn_5257) among whom He is persecuted even
until now, but proclaimed among the Gentiles and believed in,—for His
word has run over the whole world,—he will see that in His own country
Jesus had no honour, but that among those who were “strangers from the
covenants,” <span id="fr_5258"></span>[5259](#fn_5258) the Gentiles, He
is held in honour.  But what things He taught and spake in their
synagogue the Evangelists have not recorded, but only that they were so
great and of such a nature that all were astonished.  And probably the
things spoken were too high to be written down.  Only be it noted, He
taught in their synagogue, not separating from it, nor disregarding it.
