<p class="c35"><a name="xv.iii.v.xvii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xv.iii.v.xvii-p1.1"></A>17.&#160; Of the Testimony of John to Jesus in Matthew&#146;s Gospel,</span></p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.v.xvii-p2"></A>These, then, are the parallel passages of the four; let us try to see as clearly as we can what is the purport of each and wherein they differ from each other.&#160; And we will begin with Matthew, who is reported by tradition to have published his Gospel before the others, to the Hebrews, those, namely, of the circumcision who believed.&#160; I, he says, baptize you with water unto repentance, purifying you, as it were, and turning you away from evil courses and calling you to repentance; for I am come to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for Him, and by my baptism of repentance to prepare the ground for Him who is to come after me, and who will thus benefit you much more effectively and powerfully than my strength could.&#160; For His baptism is not that of the body only; He fills the penitent with the Holy Ghost, and His diviner fire does away with everything material and consumes everything that is earthy, not only from him who admits it to his life, but even from him who hears of it from those who have it.&#160; So much stronger than I is He who is coming after me, that I am not able to bear even the outskirts of the powers round Him which are furthest from Him (they are not open and exposed, so that any one could see them), nor even to bear those who support them.&#160; I know not of which I should speak.&#160; Should I speak of my own great weakness, which is not able to bear even these things about Christ which in comparison with the greater things in Him are least, or should I speak of His transcendent Deity, greater than all the world?&#160; If I who have received such grace, as to be thought worthy of prophecy predicting my arrival in this human life, in the words, &#8220;The <A NAME="page_367"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 367</FONT></A> <a name="xv.iii.v.xvii-Page_367"></A>voice of one crying in the wilderness,&#8221; and &#8220;Behold I send my messenger before thy face;&#8221; if I whose birth Gabriel who stands before God announced to my father so advanced in years, so much against his expectation, I at whose name Zacharias recovered his voice and was enabled to use it to prophesy, I to whom my Lord bears witness that among them that are born of women there is none greater than I, I am not able so much as to bear His shoes!&#160; And if not His shoes, what can be said about His garments?&#160; Who is so great as to be able to guard His coat?&#160; Who can suppose that He can understand the meaning contained in His tunic which is without seam from the top because it is woven throughout?&#160; It is to be observed that while the four represent John as declaring himself to have come to baptize with water, Matthew alone adds the words &#8220;to repentance,&#8221; teaching that the benefit of baptism is connected with the intention of the baptized person; to him who repents it is salutary, but to him who comes to it without repentance it will turn to greater condemnation.&#160; And here we must note that as the wonderful works done by the Saviour in the cures He wrought, which are symbolical of those who at any time are set free by the word of God from any sickness or disease, though they were done to the body and brought a bodily relief, yet also called those who were benefited by them to an exercise of faith, so the washing with water which is symbolic of the soul cleansing herself from every stain of wickedness, is no less in itself to him who yields himself to the divine power of the invocation of the Adorable Trinity, the beginning and source of divine gifts; for &#8220;there are diversities of gifts.&#8221;&#160; This view receives confirmation from the narrative recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, which shows the Spirit to have descended so manifestly on those who receive baptism, after the water had prepared the way for him in those who properly approached the rite.&#160; Simon Magus, astonished at what he saw, desired to receive from Peter this gift, but though it was a good thing he desired, he thought to attain it by the mammon of unrighteousness.&#160; We next remark in passing that the baptism of John was inferior to the baptism of Jesus which was given through His disciples.&#160; Those persons in the Acts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4909"></A><A HREF="#fn_4909"><FONT SIZE="1">4910</FONT></A>
 who were baptized to John&#146;s baptism and who had not heard if there was any Holy Ghost are baptized over again by the Apostle.&#160; Regeneration did not take place with John, but with Jesus through His disciples it does so, and what is called the laver of regeneration takes place with renewal of the Spirit; for the Spirit now comes in addition since it comes from God and is over and above the water and does not come to all after the water.&#160; So far, then, our examination of the statements in the Gospel according to Matthew.</p>
