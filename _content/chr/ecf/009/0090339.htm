<p class="c35"><a name="xv.iii.vi.xxiv-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xv.iii.vi.xxiv-p1.1"></A>24.&#160; The Account of the Building of Solomon&#146;s Temple Contains Serious Difficulties and is to Be Interpreted Spiritually.</span></p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.vi.xxiv-p2"></A>For the sake of those, however, who consider that nothing further than the narrative itself is meant to be indicated in these words, it may not be unfitting to introduce at this point some considerations which they can scarcely withstand, to show that the words ought to be regarded as those of the Spirit, and that the mind of the Spirit should be sought for in them.&#160; Did the sons of the kings really spend their time in hewing the great and precious stones, and practise a craft so little in keeping with royal birth?&#160; And the number of the burden-bearers and of the stone-cutters and of the officers, the duration, too, of the period of preparing the stones and marking them, is all this recorded <A NAME="page_405"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 405</FONT></A> <a name="xv.iii.vi.xxiv-Page_405"></A>as it really was?&#160; The holy house, too, was got ready in peace and was to be built for God without hammer or axe or any iron tool, that there might be no disturbance in the house of God.&#160; And again I would ask those who are in bondage to the letter how it is possible that there should be eighty thousand stone-cutters and that the house of God should be built out of hard white stones without the noise of hammer or axe or any iron tool being heard in His house while the building was going on?&#160; Is it not living stones that are hewn without any noise or tumult somewhere outside the temple, so that they are brought ready prepared to the place which awaits them in the building?&#160; And there is some sort of an ascent about the temple of God, not with angles, but with bends of straight lines.&#160; For it is written,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5123"></A><A HREF="#fn_5123"><FONT SIZE="1">5124</FONT></A>
 &#8220;And there was a winding staircase to the middle, and from the middle to the third floor;&#8221; for the staircase in the house of God had to be spiral, thus imitating in its ascent the circle, which is the most perfect figure.&#160; But that this house might be secure five ties are built in it,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5124"></A><A HREF="#fn_5124"><FONT SIZE="1">5125</FONT></A>
 as fair as possible, a cubit high, that on looking up one might see it to be suggested how we rise from sensible things to the so-called divine perceptions, and so be brought to perceive those things which are seen only by the mind.&#160; But the place of the happier stones appears to be that called Dabir,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5125"></A><A HREF="#fn_5125"><FONT SIZE="1">5126</FONT></A>
 where the ark of the covenant of the Lord was, and, as I may say, the handwriting of God, the tables written with His own finger.&#160; And the whole house is overlaid with gold; &#8220;the whole house,&#8221; we read,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5126"></A><A HREF="#fn_5126"><FONT SIZE="1">5127</FONT></A>
 &#8220;he overlaid with gold until all the house was finished.&#8221;&#160; But there were two cherubim in Dabir, a word which the translators of the Hebrew Bible into Greek failed to render satisfactorily.&#160; Some, failing to do justice to the language, render it the temple; but it is more sacred than the temple.&#160; Now everything about the house was made golden, for a sign that the mind which is quite made perfect estimates accurately the things perceived by the intellect.&#160; But it is not given to all to approach and know them; and hence the veil of the court is erected, since to most of the priests and levites the things in the inmost part of the temple are not revealed.</p>
