<span id="xii.iv.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Let Us Obey God, and Not the
Authors of Sedition.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xxi-p2"></span>Take heed, beloved, lest His many
kindnesses lead to the condemnation of us all.  \[For thus it must be\]
unless we walk worthy of Him, and with one mind do those things which
are good and well-pleasing in His sight.  For \[the Scripture\] saith in
a certain place, “The Spirit of the Lord is a candle searching the
secret parts of the belly.” <span id="fr_4098"></span>[4099](#fn_4098)  
Let us reflect how near He is, and that none of the thoughts or
reasonings in which we engage are hid from Him.  It is right, therefore,
that we should not leave the post which His will has assigned us.  Let
us rather offend those men who are foolish, and inconsiderate, and
lifted up, and who glory in the pride of their speech, than \[offend\]
God.  Let us reverence the Lord Jesus Christ, <span
id="fr_4099"></span>[4100](#fn_4099) whose blood was given for us; let
us esteem those who have the rule over us; <span
id="fr_4100"></span>[4101](#fn_4100) let us honour the aged <span
id="fr_4101"></span>[4102](#fn_4101) among us; let us train up the young
men in the fear of God; let us direct our wives to that which is good. 
Let them exhibit the lovely habit of purity \[in all their conduct\];
let them show forth the sincere disposition of meekness; let them make
<span id="page_236">p. 236</span> <span
id="xii.iv.xxi-Page_236"></span>manifest the command which they have of
their tongue, by their manner <span id="fr_4102"></span>[4103](#fn_4102)
of speaking; let them display their love, not by preferring <span
id="fr_4103"></span>[4104](#fn_4103) one to another, but by showing
equal affection to all that piously fear God.  Let your children be
partakers of true Christian training; let them learn of how great avail
humility is with God—how much the spirit of pure affection can prevail
with Him—how excellent and great His fear is, and how it saves all those
who walk in <span id="fr_4104"></span>[4105](#fn_4104) it with a pure
mind.  For He is a Searcher of the thoughts and desires \[of the
heart\]:  His breath is in us; and when He pleases, He will take it
away.
