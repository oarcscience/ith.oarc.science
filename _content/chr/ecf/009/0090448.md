<span id="xvi.ii.vi.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.vii-p1.1"></span>7.  The Power of Faith.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.vii-p2"></span>But when the Saviour said, “*O
faithfulness and perverse generation,*” <span
id="fr_5874"></span>[5875](#fn_5874) He signifies that wickedness, which
is contrary to nature, stealthily enters in from perversity, and makes
us perverted.  But of the whole race of men on earth, I think, being
oppressed by reason of their wickedness and His tarrying with them, the
Saviour said, “How long shall I be with you?”  We have already, then,
spoken in part of the words, “If ye have faith as a grain of mustard
seed, ye shall say unto this mountain,” <span
id="fr_5875"></span>[5876](#fn_5875) etc.; but nevertheless also we
shall speak in this place the things that appear to us fitted to
increase perspicuity.  The mountains here spoken of, in my opinion, are
the hostile powers that have their being in a flood of great wickedness,
such as are settled down, so to speak, in some souls of men.  Whenever,
then, any one has all faith so that he no longer disbelieves in any
things which are contained in the Holy Scriptures, and has faith such as
was that of Abraham, who believed in God to such a degree that his faith
was counted for righteousness. he has all faith as a grain of mustard
seed; then will such an one say to this mountain—I mean, the dumb and
deaf spirit in him who is called lunatic,—“Remove hence,” clearly, from
the man who is suffering, perhaps to the abyss, and it shall remove. 
And the Apostle, taking, I think. his starting-point from this place,
says with apostolical authority, “If I have all faith so as to remove
mountains,” <span id="fr_5876"></span>[5877](#fn_5876) for not one
mountain merely, but also several analogous to it, he removes who has
all faith which is as a grain of mustard-seed; and nothing shall be
impossible to him who has so great faith. <span
id="fr_5877"></span>[5878](#fn_5877)   But let us also attend to this,
“This kind goeth not out save by prayer and fasting,” <span
id="fr_5878"></span>[5879](#fn_5878) in order that if at any time it is
necessary that we should be engaged in the healing of one suffering from
such a disorder, we may not adjure, nor put questions, nor speak to the
impure spirit as if it heard, but devoting ourselves to prayer and
fasting, may be successful as we pray for the sufferer, and by our own
fasting may thrust out the unclean spirit from him.
