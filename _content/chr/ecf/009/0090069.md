<span id="v.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="v.iii-p1.1"></span>Fragments of the Apocalypse of Peter.</span>

<span id="v.iii-p2"></span>1.  <span class="sc"><span
id="v.iii-p2.1"></span>Clemens Alexandrinus</span>, *Eclog.* 48.  For
instance, Peter in the Apocalypse says that the children who are born
out of due time shall be of the better part:  and that these are
delivered over to a care-taking angel that they may attain a share of
knowledge and gain the better abode \[after suffering what they would
have suffered if they had been in the body:  but the others shall merely
obtain salvation as injured beings to whom mercy is shown, and remain
without punishment, receiving this as a reward\]. <span

<span id="v.iii-p4"></span>2.  <span class="sc"><span
id="v.iii-p4.1"></span>Clem. Alex.</span> *Eclog.* 49.  But the milk of
the women running down from their breasts and congealing shall engender
small flesh-<span id="page_147">p. 147</span> <span
id="v.iii-Page_147"></span>eating beasts:  and these run up upon them
and devour them. <span id="fr_3900"></span>[3901](#fn_3900)

<span id="v.iii-p6"></span>3.  <span class="sc"><span
id="v.iii-p6.1"></span>Macarius Magnes</span>, *Apocritica* iv., 6 cf.
16.  The earth, it (sc. the Apoc. of Peter) says, “shall present all men
before God at the day of judgment, being itself also to be judged, with
the heaven also which encompasses it.”

<span id="v.iii-p7"></span>4.  <span class="sc"><span
id="v.iii-p7.1"></span>Clem. Alex.</span> *Eclog.* 41.  The scripture
says that infants that have been exposed are delivered to a care-taking
angel, by whom they are educated and so grow up, and they will be, it
says, as the faithful of a hundred years old are here.

<span id="v.iii-p8"></span>5.  <span class="sc"><span
id="v.iii-p8.1"></span>Methodius</span>, *Conviv.* ii., 6.  Whence also
we have received in divinely-inspired scriptures that untimely births
are delivered to care-taking angels, even if they are the offspring of
adultery.
