<span id="xvi.ii.v.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.v.xvii-p1.1"></span>17.  Reasons for that Gradual
Knowledge.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.v.xvii-p2"></span>And likewise he who holds that the
fact that He was Christ had been formerly proclaimed by the Apostles
when they heard the saying, “What I tell you in the darkness, speak ye
in the light, and what ye hear in the ear proclaim on the
housetops,” <span id="fr_5674"></span>[5675](#fn_5674) will say, that He
wished first to give catechetical instruction as it were to those of the
Apostles who were to hear the name of Christ, then to permit this, so to
speak, to be digested in the minds of the hearers, that, after there had
been a period of silence in the proclamation of something of this kind
about Him, at a more seasonable time there might be built up upon the
former rudiments “Christ Jesus crucified and raised from the dead,”
which at the beginning not even the Apostles knew; for it is written in
the passage now under consideration, “From that time began Jesus to show
unto His disciples that He must go unto Jerusalem” <span
id="fr_5675"></span>[5676](#fn_5675) and suffer this and that.  But if
now, for the first time, the Apostles learn from Jesus the things that
were about to happen unto Him, namely, that the elders will plot against
Him, and that He will be killed, and that after these things, on the
third day, He will rise from the dead,—what necessity is there for
supposing that those who had been taught by the Apostles concerning
Jesus knew them before, or that although Christ was announced to them He
was announced to them by way of an introduction which did not clearly
elucidate the things concerning Him?  For our Saviour wished, when He
enjoined the disciples to tell no man that He was the Christ, to reserve
the more perfect teaching about Him to a more fitting time, when to
those who had seen Him crucified, the disciples who had seen Him
crucified and risen could testify the things relating to His
resurrection.  For if the Apostles, who were always with Him and had
seen all the wonderful things which He did, and who bore testimony to
His words that they <span id="page_461">p. 461</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.v.xvii-Page_461"></span>were words of eternal life, <span
id="fr_5676"></span>[5677](#fn_5676) were offended on the night on which
He was betrayed,—what do you suppose would have been the feelings of
those who had formerly learned that He was the Christ?  To spare them, I
think, He gave this command.
