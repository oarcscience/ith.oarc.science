<p class="c12"><a name="xii.iv.lxiii-p2"></A>Right is it, therefore, to approach examples so good and so many, and submit the neck and fulfil the part of obedience, in order that, undisturbed by vain sedition, we may attain unto the goal set before us in truth wholly free from blame.&#160; Joy and gladness will ye afford us, if ye become obedient to the words written by us and through the Holy Spirit root out the lawless wrath of your jealousy according to the intercession which we have made for peace and unity in this letter.&#160; We have sent men faithful and discreet, whose conversation from youth to old age has been blameless amongst us,&#8212;the same shall be witnesses between you and us.&#160; This we have done, that ye may know that our whole concern has been and is that ye may be speedily at peace.</p>
