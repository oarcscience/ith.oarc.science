<span id="xv.iii.vi.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>6.  Different Accounts of the Call of
Peter, and of the Imprisonment of the Baptist.  The Meaning of
“Capernaum.”</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi.vi-p2"></span>These examples may be serviceable to
illustrate statements not only about the Saviour, but about the
disciples too, for here also there is some discrepancy of statement. 
For there is a difference in thought perhaps between Simon who is found
by his own brother Andrew, and who is addressed “Thou shalt be called
Cephas,” <span id="fr_5008"></span>[5009](#fn_5008) and him who is seen
by Jesus when walking by the sea of Galilee, <span
id="fr_5009"></span>[5010](#fn_5009) along with his brother, and <span
id="page_385">p. 385</span> <span
id="xv.iii.vi.vi-Page_385"></span>addressed conjointly with that
brother, “Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.”  There was
some fitness in the fact that the writer who goes more to the root of
the matter and tells of the Word becoming flesh, and hence does not
record the human generation of the Word who was in the beginning with
God, should not tell us of Simon’s being found at the seashore and
called away from there, but of his being found by his brother who had
been staying with Jesus at the tenth hour, and of his receiving the name
Cephas in connection with his being thus found out.  If he was seen by
Jesus when walking by the sea of Galilee, it would scarcely be on a
later occasion that he was addressed, “Thou art Peter and upon this rock
I will build My church.”  With John again the Pharisees know Jesus to be
baptizing with His disciples, <span id="fr_5010"></span>[5011](#fn_5010)
adding this to His other great activities; but the Jesus of the three
does not baptize at all.  John the Baptist, too, with the Evangelist of
the same name, goes on a long time without being cast into prison.  With
Matthew, on the contrary, he is put in prison almost at the time of the
temptation of Jesus, and this is the occasion of Jesus retiring to
Galilee, to avoid being put in prison.  But in John there is nothing at
all about John’s being put in prison.  Who is so wise and so able as to
learn all the things that are recorded about Jesus in the four
Evangelists, and both to understand each incident by itself, and have a
connected view of all His sojournings and words and acts at each place? 
As for the passage presently before us, it gives in the order of events
that on the sixth day the Saviour, after the business of the marriage at
Cana of Galilee, went down with His mother and His brothers and His
disciples to Capernaum, which means “field of consolation.”  For after
the feasting and the wine it was fitting that the Saviour should come to
the field of consolation with His mother and His disciples, to console
those whom He was training for disciples and the soul which had
conceived Him by the Holy Ghost, with the fruits which were to stand in
that full field.
