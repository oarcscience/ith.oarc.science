<p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.v.xxxii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.v.xxxii-p1.1"></A>32.&#160; Standing by the Saviour.</span></p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.v.xxxii-p2"></A>The reflections in regard to the passage before us that occur to us at the present time are these:&#160; Some were standing where Jesus was, having the footsteps of the soul firmly planted with Jesus, and the standing of their feet was akin to the standing of which Moses said in the passage, &#8220;And I stood on the mountain forty days and forty nights,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5759"></A><A HREF="#fn_5759"><FONT SIZE="1">5760</FONT></A>
 who was deemed worthy to have it said to him by God who asked him to stand by Him, &#8220;But stand thou here with Me.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5760"></A><A HREF="#fn_5760"><FONT SIZE="1">5761</FONT></A>
&#160; Those who really stand by Jesus&#8212;that is, by the Word of God&#8212;do not all stand equally; for among those who stand by Jesus are differences from each other.&#160; Wherefore, not all who stand by the Saviour, but some of them as standing better, do not taste of death until they shall have seen the Word who dwelt with men, and on that account called Son of man, coming in His own kingdom; for Jesus does not always come in His own kingdom when He comes, since to the newly initiated He is such that they might say, beholding the Word Himself not glorious nor great, but inferior to many among them, &#8220;We saw Him, and He had no form or beauty, but His form was dishonoured, defective compared with all the sons of men.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5761"></A><A HREF="#fn_5761"><FONT SIZE="1">5762</FONT></A>
&#160; And these things will be said by those who beheld His glory in connection with their own former times, when at first the Word as understood in the synagogue had no form nor beauty to them.&#160; To the Word, therefore, who has assumed most manifestly the power above all words, there belongs a royal dignity which is visible to some of those who stand by Jesus, when they have been able to follow Him as He goes before them and ascends to the lofty mountain of His own manifestation.&#160; And of this honour some of those who stand by Jesus are deemed worthy if they be either a Peter against whom the gates of Hades do not prevail, or the sons of thunder,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5762"></A><A HREF="#fn_5762"><FONT SIZE="1">5763</FONT></A>
 and are begotten of the mighty voice of God who thunders and cries aloud from heaven great things to those who have ears and are wise.&#160; Such at least do not taste death.</p>
