<span id="xvi.ii.iii.i-p2"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.iii.i-p2.1"></span>1.  The Parable of the Tares:  the House
of Jesus.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.iii.i-p3"></span>“*Then He left the multitudes and went
into His house, and His disciples came unto Him saying, Declare to us
the parable of the tares of the field.*” <span
id="fr_5159"></span>[5160](#fn_5159)   When Jesus then is with the
multitudes, He is not in His house, for the multitudes are outside of
the house, and it is an act which springs from His love of men to leave
the house and to go away to those who are not able to come to Him.  Now,
having discoursed sufficiently to the multitudes in parables, He sends
them away and goes to His own house, where His disciples, who did not
abide with those whom He had sent away, come to Him.  And as many as are
more genuine hearers of Jesus first follow Him, then having inquired
about His abode, are permitted to see it, and, having come, see and
abide with Him, all for that day, and perhaps some of them even longer. 
And, in my opinion, such things are indicated in the Gospel according to
John in these words, “On the morrow again John was standing and two of
his disciples.” <span id="fr_5160"></span>[5161](#fn_5160)   And in
order to explain the fact that of those who were permitted to go with
Jesus and see His abode, the one who was more eminent becomes also an
Apostle, these words are added:  “One of the two that heard John speak
and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.” <span
id="fr_5161"></span>[5162](#fn_5161)   And if then, unlike the
multitudes whom He sends away, we wish to hear Jesus and go to the house
and receive something better than the multitudes, let us become friends
of Jesus, so that as His disciples we may come to Him when He goes into
the house, and having come may inquire about the explanation of the
parable, whether of the tares of the field, or of any other.  And in
order that it may be more accurately understood what is represented by
the house of Jesus, let some one collect from the Gospels whatsoever
things are spoken about the house of Jesus, and what things were spoken
or done by Him in it; for all the passages collected together will
convince any one who applies himself to this reading that the letters of
the Gospel are not absolutely simple as some suppose, but have become
simple to the simple by a divine concession; <span
id="fr_5162"></span>[5163](#fn_5162) but for those who have the will and
the power to hear them more acutely there are concealed things wise and
worthy of the Word of God.
