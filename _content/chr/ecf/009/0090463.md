<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xxii-p1.1"></span>22.  What the “Occasions of Stumbling”
Are.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xxii-p2"></span>“*And it must needs be that
occasions of stumbling come,*” <span
id="fr_5963"></span>[5964](#fn_5963) which I take to be different from
the men by whom they come.  The occasions then which come are an army of
the devil, his angels, and a wicked band of impure spirits, which,
seeking out instruments through whom they will work, often find men
altogether strangers to piety, and sometimes even some of those who are
thought to believe the Word of God, for whom exists a worse woe than
that which comes to him who is caused to stumble, just as also it shall
be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, <span
id="fr_5964"></span>[5965](#fn_5964) than for the places where Jesus did
signs and wonders, and yet was not believed.  But as one might undertake
to make a collection from the Scriptures of those who are pronounced
blessed, and of the things in respect of which they are so called, so
also he might undertake to do with the woes which are written, and those
in whose case the woes are spoken.  But that the woe is worse in the
case of him who causes to stumble, than in him who is made to stumble,
you may prove by the passage, “Whoso shall cause to stumble one of these
little ones which believe in Me, it is profitable for him,” <span
id="fr_5965"></span>[5966](#fn_5965) etc.; for, while the little one who
is made to stumble receives retribution from him who caused him to
stumble, it is expedient that the severe and intolerable punishment
which is written should befall the man who has caused the stumbling. 
But if we were to give more careful consideration to these things, we
should be on our guard against sinning against the brethren, and
wounding their conscience when it is weak, lest we sin against
Christ; <span id="fr_5966"></span>[5967](#fn_5966) as often our brethren
about us, “for whom Christ died,” perish, not only through our
knowledge, but also through some other causes connected with us; in the
case of whom, we, sinning against Christ, shall pay the penalty, the
soul of them who perish through us being required of us.
