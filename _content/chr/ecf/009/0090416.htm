<p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.v.xix-p2"></A>It is necessary, therefore, to the proclamation of Jesus as Christ, that He should be proclaimed as crucified; and the proclamation that Jesus was the Christ does not seem to me so defective when any of His other miracles is passed over in silence, as when the fact of His crucifixion is passed over.&#160; Wherefore, reserving the more perfect proclamation of the things concerning Him by the Apostles, He commanded His disciples that they should tell no man that He was the Christ; and He prepared them to say that He was the Christ crucified and risen from the dead, &#8220;when He began&#8221; not only to say, nor even to advance to the point of teaching merely, but &#8220;to show&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5683"></A><A HREF="#fn_5683"><FONT SIZE="1">5684</FONT></A>
 to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, etc.; for attend to the expression &#8220;show&#8221;; because just as sensible things are said to be shown so the things spoken by Him to His disciples are said to be shown by Jesus.&#160; And I do not think that each of the things seen was shown to those who saw Him suffering many things in body from the elders of the people, with such clearness as was the rational demonstration about Him to the disciples.</p>
