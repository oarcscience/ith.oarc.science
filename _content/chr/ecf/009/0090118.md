<span id="xii.iv.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Be Humble, and Believe that
Christ Will Come Again.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xxiii-p2"></span>The all-merciful and beneficent Father
has bowels \[of compassion\] towards those that fear Him, and kindly and
lovingly bestows His favours upon those who come to Him with a simple
mind.  Wherefore let us not be double-minded; neither let our soul be
lifted <span id="fr_4108"></span>[4109](#fn_4108) up on account of His
exceedingly great and glorious gifts.  Far from us be that which is
written, “Wretched are they who are of a double mind, and of a doubting
heart; who say, These things we have heard even in the times of our
fathers; but, behold, we have grown old, and none of them has happened
unto us;” <span id="fr_4109"></span>[4110](#fn_4109) Ye foolish ones!
compare yourselves to a tree; take \[for instance\] the vine.  First of
all, it sheds its leaves, <span id="fr_4110"></span>[4111](#fn_4110)
then it buds, next it puts forth leaves, and then it flowers; after that
comes the sour grape, and then follows the ripened fruit.  Ye perceive
how in a little time the fruit of a tree comes to maturity.  Of a truth,
soon and suddenly shall His will be accomplished, as the Scripture also
bears witness, saying, “Speedily will He come, and will not
tarry;” <span id="fr_4111"></span>[4112](#fn_4111) and, “The Lord shall
suddenly come to His temple, even the Holy One, for whom ye look.” <span
id="fr_4112"></span>[4113](#fn_4112)
