<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p3"></span>But he who was made fit to be a
minister of the New Covenant, not of the letter, but of the spirit,
Paul, who fulfilled the Gospel from Jerusalem round about to
Illyricum, <span id="fr_4785"></span>[4786](#fn_4785) did not write
epistles to all the churches he taught, and to those to whom he did
write he sent no more than a few lines.  And Peter, on whom the Church
of Christ is built, against which the gates of hell shall not
prevail <span id="fr_4786"></span>[4787](#fn_4786) left only one epistle
of acknowledged genuineness.  Suppose we allow that he left a second;
for this is doubtful.  What are we to say of him who leaned on Jesus’
breast, namely, John, who left one Gospel, though confessing <span
id="fr_4787"></span>[4788](#fn_4787) that he could make so many that the
world would not contain them?  But he wrote also the Apocalypse, being
commanded to be silent and not to write the voices of the seven
thunders. <span id="fr_4788"></span>[4789](#fn_4788)   But he also left
an epistle of very few lines.  <span id="page_347">p. 347</span> <span
id="xv.iii.iv.iii-Page_347"></span>Suppose also a second and a third,
since not all pronounce these to be genuine; but the two together do not
amount to a hundred lines.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p8"></span>\[*Then, after enumerating the
prophets and Apostles, and showing how each wrote only a little, or not
even a little, he goes on:*\] <span id="fr_4789"></span>[4790](#fn_4789)
