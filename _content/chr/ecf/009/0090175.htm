<p class="c35"><a name="xii.vi.xiii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xii.vi.xiii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XIII.&#8212;God&#146;s Name Not to Be Blasphemed.</span></p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xii.vi.xiii-p2"></A>Brethren, then, let us now at length repent, let us soberly turn to that which is good; for we are full of abundant folly and wickedness.&#160; Let us wipe out from us our former sins, and repenting from the heart be saved; and let us not be men-pleasers, nor be willing to please one another only, but also the men without, for righteousness sake, that the name may not be, because of us, blasphemed.&#160; For the Lord saith, &#8220;Continually my name is blasphemed among all nations,&#8221; and &#8220;Wherefore my name is blasphemed; blasphemed in what?&#160; In your not doing the things which I wish.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4391"></A><A HREF="#fn_4391"><FONT SIZE="1">4392</FONT></A>
&#160; For the nations, hearing from our mouth the oracles of God, marvel at their excellence and worth; thereafter learning that our deeds are not worthy of the words which we speak,&#8212;receiving this occasion they turn to blasphemy, saying that they are a fable and a delusion.&#160; For, whenever they hear from us that God saith, &#8220;No thank have ye, if ye love them which love you, but ye have thank, if ye love your enemies and them which hate you&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4392"></A><A HREF="#fn_4392"><FONT SIZE="1">4393</FONT></A>
&#8212;whenever they hear these words, they marvel at the surpassing measure of their goodness; but when they see, that not only do we not love those who hate, but that we love not even those who love, they laugh us to scorn, and the name is blasphemed.</p>
