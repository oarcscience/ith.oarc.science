<p class="c35"><a name="xii.iv.xvi-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xii.iv.xvi-p1.1"></A>Chapter XVI.&#8212;Christ as an Example of Humility.</span></p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xii.iv.xvi-p2"></A>For Christ is of those who are humble-minded, and not of those who exalt themselves over His flock.&#160; Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Sceptre of the majesty of God, did not come in the pomp of pride or arrogance, although He might have done so, but in a lowly condition, as the Holy Spirit had declared regarding Him.&#160; For He says, &#8220;Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?&#160; We have declared [our message] in His presence:&#160; He is, as it were, a child, and like a root in thirsty ground; He has no form nor glory, yea, we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness; but His form was without eminence, yea, deficient in comparison with the [ordinary] form of men.&#160; He is a man exposed to stripes and suffering, and acquainted with the endurance of grief:&#160; for His countenance was turned away; He was despised, and not esteemed.&#160; He bears our iniquities, and is in sorrow for our sakes; yet we supposed that [on His own account] He was exposed to labour, and stripes, and affliction.&#160; But He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities.&#160; <A NAME="page_234"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 234</FONT></A> <a name="xii.iv.xvi-Page_234"></A>The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we were healed.&#160; All we, like sheep, have gone astray; [every] man has wandered in his own way; and the Lord has delivered Him up for our sins, while He in the midst of His sufferings openeth not His mouth.&#160; He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before her shearer is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth.&#160; In His humiliation His judgment was taken away; who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken from the earth.&#160; For the transgressions of my people was He brought down to death.&#160; And I will give the wicked for His sepulchre, and the rich for His death,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4072"></A><A HREF="#fn_4072"><FONT SIZE="1">4073</FONT></A>
 because He did no iniquity, neither was guile found in His mouth.&#160; And the Lord is pleased to purify him by stripes.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4073"></A><A HREF="#fn_4073"><FONT SIZE="1">4074</FONT></A>
&#160; If ye make&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4074"></A><A HREF="#fn_4074"><FONT SIZE="1">4075</FONT></A>
 an offering for sin, your soul shall see a long-lived seed.&#160; And the Lord is pleased to relieve Him of the affliction of His soul, to show Him light, and to form Him with understanding,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4075"></A><A HREF="#fn_4075"><FONT SIZE="1">4076</FONT></A>
 to justify the Just One who ministereth well to many; and He Himself shall carry their sins.&#160; On this account He shall inherit many, and shall divide the spoil of the strong; because His soul was delivered to death, and He was reckoned among the transgressors, and He bare the sins of many, and for their sins was He delivered.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4076"></A><A HREF="#fn_4076"><FONT SIZE="1">4077</FONT></A>
&#160; And again He saith, &#8220;I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.&#160; All that see me have derided me; they have spoken with their lips; they have wagged their head, [saying] He hoped in God, let Him deliver Him, let Him save Him, since He delighteth in Him.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4077"></A><A HREF="#fn_4077"><FONT SIZE="1">4078</FONT></A>
&#160; Ye see, beloved, what is the example which has been given us; for if the Lord thus humbled Himself, what shall we do who have through Him come under the yoke of His grace?</p>
