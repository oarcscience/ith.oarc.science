<span id="xv.iii.v.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.v.iv-p1.1"></span>4.  John Denies that He is Elijah or “The”
Prophet.  Yet He Was “A” Prophet.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v.iv-p2"></span>Now let us consider John’s second
testimony.  Jews from Jerusalem, <span
id="fr_4831"></span>[4832](#fn_4831) kindred to John the Baptist, since
he also belonged to a priestly race, send priests and levites to ask
John who he is.  In saying, “I am not the Christ,” he made a confession
of the truth.  The words are not, as one might suppose, a negation; for
it is no negation to say, in the honour of Christ, that one is not
Christ.  The priests and levites sent from Jerusalem, having there heard
in the first place that he is not the expected Messiah, put a question
about the second great personage whom they expected, namely, Elijah,
whether John were he, and he says he is not Elijah, and by his “I am
not” makes a second confession of the truth.  And, as many prophets had
appeared in Israel, and one in particular was looked for according to
the prophecy of Moses, who said, <span
id="fr_4832"></span>[4833](#fn_4832) “A prophet shall the Lord your God
raise up to you of your brethren, like unto me, him shall ye hear; and
it shall come to pass that every soul that shall not hear that prophet
shall be destroyed from among the people,” they, therefore, ask a third
question, not whether he is a prophet, but whether he is the prophet. 
Now, they did not apply this <span id="page_354">p. 354</span> <span
id="xv.iii.v.iv-Page_354"></span>name to the Christ, but supposed the
prophet to be a second figure beside the Christ.  But John, on the
contrary, who knew that He whose forerunner he was was both the Christ
and the prophet thus foretold, answered “No;” whereas, if they had asked
if he was a prophet, he would have answered “Yes;” <span
id="fr_4833"></span>[4834](#fn_4833) for he was not unconscious that he
was a prophet.  In all these answers John’s second testimony to Christ
was not yet completed; he had still to give his questioners the answer
they were to take back to those who sent them, and to declare himself in
the terms of the prophecy of Isaiah, which says, “The voice of one
crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord.”
