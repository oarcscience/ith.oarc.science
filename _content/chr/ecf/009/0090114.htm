<p class="c12"><a name="xii.iv.xix-p2"></A>Thus the humility and godly submission of so great and illustrious men have rendered not only us, but also all the generations before us, better; even as many as have received His oracles in fear and truth.&#160; Wherefore, having so many great and glorious examples set before us, let us turn again to the practice of that peace which from the beginning was the mark set before us;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4093"></A><A HREF="#fn_4093"><FONT SIZE="1">4094</FONT></A>
 and let us look stedfastly to the Father and Creator of the universe, and cleave to His mighty and surpassingly great gifts and benefactions of peace.&#160; Let us contemplate Him with our understanding, and look with the eyes of our soul to His long-suffering will.&#160; Let us reflect how free from the wrath He is towards all His creation.</p>
