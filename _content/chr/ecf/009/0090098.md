id="xii.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—The Sad State of the Corinthian
Church After Sedition Arose in It from Envy and Emulation.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.iii-p2"></span>Every kind of honour and happiness <span
id="fr_4010"></span>[4011](#fn_4010) was bestowed upon you, and then was
fulfilled that which is written, “My beloved did eat and drink, and was
enlarged and became fat, and kicked.” <span
id="fr_4011"></span>[4012](#fn_4011)   Hence flowed emulation and envy,
strife and sedition, persecution and disorder, war and captivity.  So
the worthless rose up against the honoured, those of no reputation
against such as were renowned, the foolish against the wise, the young
against those advanced in years.  For this reason righteousness and
peace are now far departed from you, inasmuch as every one abandons the
fear of God, and is become blind in His faith, <span
id="fr_4012"></span>[4013](#fn_4012) neither walks in the ordinances of
His appointment, nor acts a part becoming a Christian, <span
id="fr_4013"></span>[4014](#fn_4013) but walks after his own wicked
lusts, resuming the practice of an unrighteous and ungodly envy, by
which death itself entered into the world. <span
id="fr_4014"></span>[4015](#fn_4014)
