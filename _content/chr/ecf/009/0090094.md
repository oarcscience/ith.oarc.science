<span id="xii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c6"><span
id="xii.iii-p1.1"></span>Additional Introduction.</span>

<span id="xii.iii-p2"></span>Towards the close of 1875, at
Constantinople, Philotheus Bryennius, Metropolitan of Serræ, published
the first complete edition of the epistles ascribed to Clement.  This he
was enabled to do by the discovery of a <span class="sc"><span
id="xii.iii-p2.1"></span>ms.</span> in the library of the Holy Sepulchre
at Fanari in Constantinople.  This <span class="sc"><span
id="xii.iii-p2.2"></span>ms.</span>, of vellum, consists of one hundred
and twenty leaves in small octavo, nearly seven and a half inches in
length and six in breadth.  The <span class="sc"><span
id="xii.iii-p2.3"></span>ms.</span> bears the date 1056, and was written
by one Leo.  Its contents are:

<span id="xii.iii-p3"></span>1.  Chrysostom’s Synopsis of the Old
Testament (the New also being included in the title).

<span id="xii.iii-p4"></span>2.  Epistle of Barnabas.

<span id="xii.iii-p5"></span>3.  Clement to the Corinthians I.

<span id="xii.iii-p6"></span>4.  Clement to the Corinthians II.

<span id="xii.iii-p7"></span>5.  Teaching of the Twelve Apostles.

<span id="xii.iii-p8"></span>6.  Ignatian Epistles.

<span id="xii.iii-p9"></span>The <span class="sc"><span
id="xii.iii-p9.1"></span>ms.</span> is written with comparative accuracy
and clearness.  Internal evidence seems to establish its independent
value; *e.g.*, words carelessly omitted in the Codex Alexandrinus are
found in this <span class="sc"><span
id="xii.iii-p9.2"></span>ms.</span>  It also supplies the *lacunæ*,
notably chapters 57 (concluding sentence)—63 inclusive of the first
Epistle and chapters 12 (concluding sentences)—20, being the close of
the second Epistle.  Harnack seems to prove that the new <span
class="sc"><span id="xii.iii-p9.3"></span>ms.</span> is as complete as
the original Alexandrian.

<span id="xii.iii-p10"></span>The *lacuna* of the first Epistle consists
mainly of a prayer, the writer somewhat abruptly passing from the
*oratio obliqua* to the *oratio recta*.  The prayer is indicative of
intense earnestness and emotion rather than official authority.  It is
marked by wealth of quotation, especially from the Septuagint.  Perhaps,
too, the nature of the sufferings referred to in the opening chapters
may be inferred from the petitions of this prayer.

<span id="xii.iii-p11"></span>In the Notes the old <span
class="sc"><span id="xii.iii-p11.1"></span>ms.</span> is indicated by A,
the recently discovered <span class="sc"><span
id="xii.iii-p11.2"></span>ms.</span> by I.
