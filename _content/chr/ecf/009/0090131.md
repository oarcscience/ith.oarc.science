id="xii.iv.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—All Blessings are Given to
Us Through Christ.</span>

<span id="xii.iv.xxxvi-p2"></span>This is the way, beloved, in which we
find our Saviour, <span id="fr_4189"></span>[4190](#fn_4189) even Jesus
Christ, the High Priest of all our offerings, the defender and helper of
our infirmity.  By Him we look up to the heights of heaven.  By Him we
behold, as in a glass, His immaculate and most excellent visage.  By Him
are the eyes of our hearts opened.  By Him our foolish and darkened
understanding blossoms <span id="fr_4190"></span>[4191](#fn_4190) up
anew towards His marvellous light.  By Him the Lord has willed that we
should taste of immortal knowledge, <span
id="fr_4191"></span>[4192](#fn_4191) “who, being the brightness of His
majesty, is by so much greater than the angels, as He hath by
inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.” <span
id="fr_4192"></span>[4193](#fn_4192)   For it is thus written, “Who
maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire.” <span
id="fr_4193"></span>[4194](#fn_4193)   But concerning His Son <span
id="fr_4194"></span>[4195](#fn_4194) the Lord spoke thus:  “Thou art my
Son, to-day have I begotten Thee.  Ask of me, and I will give Thee the
heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
Thy possession.” <span id="fr_4195"></span>[4196](#fn_4195)   And again
He saith to Him, “Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies
Thy footstool.” <span id="fr_4196"></span>[4197](#fn_4196)   But who are
His enemies?  All the wicked, and those who set themselves to oppose the
will of God. <span id="fr_4197"></span>[4198](#fn_4197)
