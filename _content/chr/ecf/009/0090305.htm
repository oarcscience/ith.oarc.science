<p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.v.xxix-p2"></A>But that the Spirit in the inspired Scriptures is not speaking mainly of rivers to be seen with the eyes, may be gathered from Ezekiel&#146;s prophecies against Pharaoh, king of Egypt:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4946"></A><A HREF="#fn_4946"><FONT SIZE="1">4947</FONT></A>
&#160; &#8220;Behold I am against thee, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great dragon, seated in the midst of rivers, who sayest, Mine are the rivers, and I made them.&#160; And I will put traps in thy jaws, and I will make the fishes of the river to stick to thy fins, and I will bring thee up from the midst of thy river, and all the fish of the river, and I will cast thee down quickly and all the fish of the river; thou shalt fall upon the face of thy land, and thou shalt not be gathered together, and thou shalt not be adorned.&#8221;&#160; For what real bodily dragon has ever been reported as having been seen in the material river of Egypt?&#160; But consider if the river of Egypt be not the dwelling of the dragon who is our enemy, who was not even able to kill the child Moses.&#160; But as the dragon is in the river of Egypt, so is God in the river which makes glad the city of God; for the Father is in the Son.&#160; Hence those who come to wash themselves in Him put away the reproach of Egypt, and become more fit to be restored.&#160; They are cleansed from that foulest leprosy, receive a double portion of spiritual gifts, and are made ready to receive the Holy Spirit, since the spiritual dove does not light on any other stream.&#160; Thus we have considered in a way more worthy of the sacred <A NAME="page_375"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 375</FONT></A> <a name="xv.iii.v.xxix-Page_375"></A>subject the Jordan and the purification that is in it, and Jesus being washed in it, and the house of preparation.&#160; Let us, then, draw from the river as much help as we require.</p>
