<p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.ix-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.ix-p1.1"></A>9.&#160; Satan and the &#8220;Delivery&#8221; Of Jesus.</span></p> 
<p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.ix-p2"></A>Now we must think that the devil has the power of death,&#8212;not of that which is common and indifferent, in accordance with which those who are compacted of soul and body die, when their soul is separated from the body,&#8212;but of that death which is contrary to and the enemy of Him who said, &#8220;I am the Life,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5892"></A><A HREF="#fn_5892"><FONT SIZE="1">5893</FONT></A>
 in accordance with which &#8220;the soul that sinneth, it shall die.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5893"></A><A HREF="#fn_5893"><FONT SIZE="1">5894</FONT></A>
&#160; But that it was not God who gave Him up into the hands of men, the Saviour manifestly declares when He says, &#8220;If My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5894"></A><A HREF="#fn_5894"><FONT SIZE="1">5895</FONT></A>
&#160; For, when He was delivered up to the Jews, He was delivered into the hands of men, not by His own servants, but by the prince of this age who says, concerning the powers which are in the sphere of the invisible, the kingdoms which are set up against men, &#8220;All these things will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and worship Me.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5895"></A><A HREF="#fn_5895"><FONT SIZE="1">5896</FONT></A>
&#160; Wherefore also we should think that in regard to them it was said, &#8220;The kings of the earth stood side by side, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5896"></A><A HREF="#fn_5896"><FONT SIZE="1">5897</FONT></A>
&#160; And those kings, indeed, and those rulers stood side by side and were gathered against the Lord and against His Christ; but we, because we have been benefited by His being delivered by them into the hands of men and slain, say, &#8220;Let us break their <A NAME="page_481"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 481</FONT></A> <a name="xvi.ii.vi.ix-Page_481"></A>bonds asunder and cast away their yoke from us.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5897"></A><A HREF="#fn_5897"><FONT SIZE="1">5898</FONT></A>
&#160; For, when we become conformed to the death of Christ, we are no longer under the bonds of the kings of the earth, as we have said, nor under the yoke of the princes of this age, who were gathered together against the Lord.&#160; And, on this account, &#8220;the Father spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5898"></A><A HREF="#fn_5898"><FONT SIZE="1">5899</FONT></A>
 that those, who took Him and delivered Him up into the hands of men, might be laughed at by Him who dwells in the heavens, and might be derided by the Lord, inasmuch as, contrary to their expectation, it was to the destruction of their own kingdom and power, that they received from the Father the Son, who was raised on the third day, by having abolished His enemy death, and made us conformed, not only to the image of His death but also of His resurrection; through whom we walk in newness of life,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5899"></A><A HREF="#fn_5899"><FONT SIZE="1">5900</FONT></A>
 no longer sitting &#8220;in the region and shadow of death,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5900"></A><A HREF="#fn_5900"><FONT SIZE="1">5901</FONT></A>
 through the light of God which has sprung up upon us.&#160; But when the Saviour said, &#8220;The Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill Him, and the third day He shall rise again,&#8221; they were &#8220;exceeding sorry,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5901"></A><A HREF="#fn_5901"><FONT SIZE="1">5902</FONT></A>
 giving heed to the fact that He was about to be delivered up into the hands of men, and that He would be killed, as matters gloomy and calling for sorrow, but not attending to the fact that He would rise on the third day, as He needed no longer time &#8220;to bring to nought through death him that had the power of death.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5902"></A><A HREF="#fn_5902"><FONT SIZE="1">5903</FONT></A>
