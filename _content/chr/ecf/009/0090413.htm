<p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.v.xvi-p2"></A>But now we must first investigate the fact that they were declaring other things about Him as being great and wonderful, but did not yet proclaim that He was the Christ, lest the Saviour may not appear to take away from them the authority to announce that He was the Christ, which He had formerly bestowed upon them.&#160; And perhaps some one will support an argument of this kind, saying that on their introduction into the school of Christ the Jews were taught by the disciples glorious things about Jesus, so that in due season there might be built upon these as a foundation the things about Jesus being the Christ; and perhaps many of the things which were said to them were said to all who virtually believed; for not to the Apostles alone did the saying apply, &#8220;Before governors and kings also shall ye be brought for My sake for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5671"></A><A HREF="#fn_5671"><FONT SIZE="1">5672</FONT></A>
 and perhaps also not to the Apostles absolutely, but to all who were about to believe the word, &#8220;And brother shall deliver up brother to death,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5672"></A><A HREF="#fn_5672"><FONT SIZE="1">5673</FONT></A>
 etc.; but, &#8220;Whosoever shall confess Me,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5673"></A><A HREF="#fn_5673"><FONT SIZE="1">5674</FONT></A>
 etc., is said not specially to the Apostles, but also to all believers.&#160; According to this, then, through that which was said to the Apostles an outline was given beforehand of the teaching which would afterwards come to be of service both to them and to every teacher.</p>
