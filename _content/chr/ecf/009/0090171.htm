<p class="c12"><a name="xii.vi.ix-p2"></A>And let no one of you say that this very flesh shall not be judged, nor rise again.&#160; Consider ye in what [state] ye were saved, in what ye received sight,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4377"></A><A HREF="#fn_4377"><FONT SIZE="1">4378</FONT></A>
 if not while ye were in this flesh.&#160; We must therefore preserve the flesh as the temple of God.&#160; For as ye were called in the flesh, ye shall also come [to be judged] in the flesh.&#160; As Christ&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4378"></A><A HREF="#fn_4378"><FONT SIZE="1">4379</FONT></A>
 the Lord who saved us, though He was first a Spirit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4379"></A><A HREF="#fn_4379"><FONT SIZE="1">4380</FONT></A>
 became flesh, and thus called us, so shall we also receive the reward in this flesh.&#160; Let us therefore love one another, that we may all attain to the kingdom of God.&#160; While we have an opportunity of being healed, let us yield ourselves to God that healeth us, and give to Him a recompense.&#160; Of what sort?&#160; Repentance out of a sincere heart; for He knows all things beforehand, and is acquainted with what is in our hearts.&#160; Let us therefore give Him praise, not with the mouth only, but also with the heart, that He may accept us as sons.&#160; For the Lord has said, &#8220;Those are my brethren who do the will of my Father.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4380"></A><A HREF="#fn_4380"><FONT SIZE="1">4381</FONT></A>
