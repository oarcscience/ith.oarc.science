<p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.i.xxxii-p2"></A>None of these testimonies, however, sets forth distinctly the Saviour&#146;s exalted birth; but when the words are addressed to Him, &#8220;Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4607"></A><A HREF="#fn_4607"><FONT SIZE="1">4608</FONT></A>
 this is spoken to Him by God, with whom all time is to-day, for there is no evening with God, as I consider, and there is no morning, nothing but time that stretches out, along with His unbeginning and unseen life.&#160; The day is to-day with Him in which the Son was begotten, and thus the beginning of His birth is not found, as neither is the day of it.</p>
