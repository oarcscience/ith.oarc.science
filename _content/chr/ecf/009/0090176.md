id="xii.vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—The Church Spiritual.</span>

<span id="xii.vi.xiv-p2"></span>So, then, brethren, if we do the will of
our Father God, we shall be members of the first church, the
spiritual,—that which was created before sun and moon; but if we shall
not do the will of the Lord, we shall come under the Scripture which
saith, “My house became a den of robbers.” <span
id="fr_4393"></span>[4394](#fn_4393)   So, then, let us <span
id="page_255">p. 255</span> <span id="xii.vi.xiv-Page_255"></span>elect
to belong to the church of life, <span
id="fr_4394"></span>[4395](#fn_4394) that we may be saved.  I think not
that ye are ignorant that the living church is the body of Christ (for
the Scripture, saith, “God created man male and female;” <span
id="fr_4395"></span>[4396](#fn_4395) the male is Christ, the female the
church,) and that the Books <span id="fr_4396"></span>[4397](#fn_4396)
and the Apostles teach that the church is not of the present, but from
the beginning.  For it was spiritual, as was also our Jesus, and was
made manifest at the end of the days in order to save you. <span
id="fr_4397"></span>[4398](#fn_4397)   The church being spiritual, was
made manifest in the flesh of Christ, signifying to us that if any one
of us shall preserve it in the flesh and corrupt it not, he shall
receive it in the Holy Spirit.  For this flesh is the type of the
spirit; no one, therefore, having corrupted the type, will receive
afterwards the antitype.  Therefore is it, then, that He saith,
brethren, “Preserve ye the flesh, that ye may become partakers of the
spirit.”  If we say that the flesh is the church and the spirit Christ,
then it follows that he who shall offer outrage to the flesh is guilty
of outrage on the church.  Such an one, therefore, will not partake of
the spirit, which is Christ.  Such is the life and immortality, which
this flesh may afterwards receive, the Holy Spirit cleaving to it; and
no one can either express or utter what things the Lord hath prepared
for His elect. <span id="fr_4398"></span>[4399](#fn_4398)
