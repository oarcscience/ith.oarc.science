<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xviii-p1.1"></span>18.  Who Was the Little Child Called by
Jesus.</span>

<span id="xvi.ii.vi.xviii-p2"></span>Now another interpretation
different from what is called the simpler may be uttered; whether as
dogma, or for the sake of exercise, so to speak, let us also inquire
what was the little child who was called by Jesus and set in the midst
of the disciples.  Now consider if you can say that the little child,
whom Jesus called, was the Holy Spirit who humbled Himself, when He was
called by the Saviour, and set in the midst of the reason of the
disciples of Jesus; if, indeed, He wishes us, being turned away from
everything else, to be turned towards the examples suggested by the Holy
Spirit, so that we may so become as the little children, who are
themselves also turned and likened to the Holy Spirit; which little
children God gave to the Saviour, according to what is said in Isaiah,
“Behold, I and the little children which God has given to me.” <span
id="fr_5934"></span>[5935](#fn_5934)   And it is not possible for any
one to enter into the kingdom of heaven, who has not been turned away
from the affairs of this world, and made like unto the little children
who possess the Holy Spirit; which Holy Spirit was called by Jesus, and,
descending from His own perfection to men as a little child, was set by
Jesus in the midst of the disciples.  It is necessary, then, for him who
has turned away from the desires of this world to humble himself not
simply as the little child, but, according to what is written, <span
id="page_486">p. 486</span> <span
id="xvi.ii.vi.xviii-Page_486"></span>“as this little child.” <span
id="fr_5935"></span>[5936](#fn_5935)   But to humble oneself as that
little child is to imitate the Holy Spirit, who humbled Himself for the
salvation of men.  Now, that the Saviour and the Holy Spirit were sent
by the Father for the salvation of men has been declared in Isaiah, in
the person of the Saviour, saying, “And now the Lord hath sent me and
His Spirit.” <span id="fr_5936"></span>[5937](#fn_5936)   You must know,
however, that this expression is ambiguous; for either God sent, but
also the Holy Spirit sent, the Saviour; or, as we have taken it, the
Father sent both—the Saviour and the Holy Spirit.  He, therefore, who
has humbled himself more than all those who have humbled themselves in
imitation of that little child, is the greatest in the kingdom of
heaven.  For there are many who are willing to humble themselves as that
little child; but the man, who in every respect has become like to the
little child who humbled himself, in the name of Jesus—especially in
Jesus Himself,—in reality, would be found to be he who is named greater
than all in the kingdom of heaven.  But as he receives Jesus, whosoever
receives one such of the little children in His name, so he rejects
Jesus and casts Him out, who does not wish to receive one such little
child in the name of Jesus.  But if, also, there is a difference in
those who are deemed worthy of the Holy Spirit, as believers receive
more or less of the Holy Spirit, there would be some little ones among
those who believe in God who can be made to stumble:  to avenge whose
being made to stumble the Word says, with reference to those who had
caused them to stumble, “It is profitable for him that an ass’s
millstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be sunk in
the depth of the sea.” <span id="fr_5937"></span>[5938](#fn_5937)   Let
these things be said in regard to the passage of Matthew before us.
