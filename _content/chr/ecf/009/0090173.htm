<p class="c12"><a name="xii.vi.xi-p2"></A>Let us therefore serve God with a pure heart, and we shall be righteous; but if we do not serve Him, because we believe not the promise of God, we shall be miserable.&#160; For the prophetic word also declares, &#8220;Wretched are those of a double mind, and who doubt in their heart, who say, All these things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4385"></A><A HREF="#fn_4385"><FONT SIZE="1">4386</FONT></A>
 have we heard even in the times of our fathers; but though we have waited day by day, we have seen none of them [accomplished].&#160; Ye fools! compare yourselves to a tree; take, for instance, the vine.&#160; First of all it sheds its leaves, then the bud appears; after that the sour grape, and then the fully-ripened fruit.&#160; So, likewise, my people have borne disturbances and afflictions, but afterwards shall they receive their good things.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4386"></A><A HREF="#fn_4386"><FONT SIZE="1">4387</FONT></A>
&#160; Wherefore, my brethren, let us not be of a double mind, but let us hope and endure, that we also may obtain the reward.&#160; For He is faithful who has promised that He will bestow on every one a reward according to his works.&#160; If, therefore, we shall do righteousness in the sight of God, we shall enter into His kingdom, and shall receive the promises, which &#8220;ear hath not heard, nor eye seen, neither have entered into the heart of man.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4387"></A><A HREF="#fn_4387"><FONT SIZE="1">4388</FONT></A>
