<p class="c12"><a name="xii.vi.xii-p2"></A>Let us expect, therefore, hour by hour, the kingdom of God in love and righteousness, since we know not the day of the appearing of God.&#160; For the Lord Himself, being asked by one when His kingdom would come, replied, &#8220;When two shall be one, that which is without as that which is within, and the male with the female, neither male nor female.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4388"></A><A HREF="#fn_4388"><FONT SIZE="1">4389</FONT></A>
