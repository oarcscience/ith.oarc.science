<span id="xii.iv.ix-p2"></span>Wherefore, let us yield obedience to His
excellent and glorious will; and imploring His mercy and
loving-kindness, while we forsake all fruitless labours <span
id="fr_4047"></span>[4048](#fn_4047) and strife, and envy, which leads
to death, let us turn and have recourse to His compassions.  Let us
<span id="page_232">p. 232</span> <span
id="xii.iv.ix-Page_232"></span>stedfastly contemplate those who have
perfectly ministered to his excellent glory.  Let us take (for instance)
Enoch, who, being found righteous in obedience, was translated, and
death was never known to happen to him. <span
id="fr_4048"></span>[4049](#fn_4048)   Noah, being found faithful,
preached regeneration to the world through his ministry; and the Lord
saved by him the animals which, with one accord, entered into the ark.
