<p class="c12"><a name="xii.iv.xx-p2"></A>The heavens, revolving under His government, are subject to Him in peace.&#160; Day and night run the course appointed by Him, in no wise hindering each other.&#160; The sun and moon, with the companies of the stars, roll on in harmony according to His command, within their prescribed limits, and without any deviation.&#160; The fruitful earth, according to His will, brings forth food in abundance, at the proper seasons, for man and beast and all the living beings upon it, never hesitating, nor changing any of the ordinances which He has fixed.&#160; The unsearchable places of abysses, and the indescribable arrangements of the lower world, are restrained by the same laws.&#160; The vast unmeasurable sea, gathered together by His working into various basins,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4094"></A><A HREF="#fn_4094"><FONT SIZE="1">4095</FONT></A>
 never passes beyond the bounds placed around it, but does as He has commanded.&#160; For He said, &#8220;Thus far shalt thou come, and thy waves shall be broken within thee.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4095"></A><A HREF="#fn_4095"><FONT SIZE="1">4096</FONT></A>
&#160; The ocean, impassable to man and the worlds beyond it, are regulated by the same enactments of the Lord.&#160; The seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, peacefully give place&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4096"></A><A HREF="#fn_4096"><FONT SIZE="1">4097</FONT></A>
 to one another.&#160; The winds in their several quarters&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4097"></A><A HREF="#fn_4097"><FONT SIZE="1">4098</FONT></A>
 fulfil, at the proper time, their service without hindrance.&#160; The ever-flowing fountains, formed both for enjoyment and health, furnish without fail their breasts for the life of men.&#160; The very smallest of living beings meet together in peace and concord.&#160; All these the great Creator and Lord of all has appointed to exist in peace and harmony; while He does good to all, but most abundantly to us who have fled for refuge to His compassions through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be glory and majesty for ever and ever.&#160; Amen.</p>
