id="vi.XI.I-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.—By Confession He Desires to
Stimulate Towards God His Own Love and That of His Readers.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.I-p2"></span>1. <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.XI.I-p2.1"></span>O Lord</span>, since eternity is Thine, art
Thou ignorant of the things which I say unto Thee? Or seest Thou at the
time that which cometh to pass in time? Why, therefore, do I place
before Thee so many relations of things? Not surely that Thou mightest
know them through me, but that I may awaken my own love and that of my
readers towards Thee, that we may all say, “Great is the Lord, and
greatly to be praised.” <span id="fr_998"></span>[999](#fn_998) I have
already said, and shall say, for the love of Thy love do I this. For we
also pray, and yet Truth says, “Your Father knoweth what things ye have
need of before ye ask Him.” <span id="fr_999"></span>[1000](#fn_999)
Therefore do we make known unto Thee our love, in confessing unto Thee
our own miseries and Thy mercies upon us, that Thou mayest free us
altogether, since Thou hast begun, that we may cease to be wretched in
ourselves, and that we may be blessed in Thee; since Thou hast called
us, that we may be poor in spirit, and meek, and mourners, and hungering
and athirst after righteousness, and merciful, and pure in heart, and
peacemakers. <span id="fr_1000"></span>[1001](#fn_1000) Behold, I have
told unto Thee many things, which I could and which I would, for Thou
first wouldest that I should confess unto Thee, the Lord my God, for
Thou art good, since Thy “mercy endureth for ever.” <span
