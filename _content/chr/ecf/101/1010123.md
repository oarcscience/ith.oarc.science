God.</span>

<span id="vi.VII.XV-p2"></span>21. And I looked back on other things,
and I perceived that it was to Thee they owed their being, and that they
were all bounded in Thee; but in another way, not as being in space, but
because Thou holdest all things in Thine hand in truth: and all things
are true so far as they have a being; nor is there any falsehood, unless
that which is not is thought to be. And I saw that all things
harmonized, not with their places only, but with their seasons also. And
that Thou, who only art eternal, didst not begin to work after
innumerable spaces of times; for that all spaces of times, both those
which have passed and which shall pass, neither go nor come, save
through Thee, working and abiding. <span
