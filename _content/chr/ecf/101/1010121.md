id="vi.VII.XIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—It is Meet to Praise the
Creator for the Good Things Which are Made in Heaven and Earth.</span>

<span id="vi.VII.XIII-p2"></span>19. And to Thee is there nothing at all
evil, and not only to Thee, but to Thy whole creation; because there is
nothing without which can break in, and mar that order which Thou hast
appointed it. But in the parts thereof, some things, because they
harmonize not with others, are considered evil; <span
id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538) whereas those very things harmonize
with others, and are good, and in themselves are good. And all these
things which do not harmonize together harmonize with the inferior part
which we call earth, having its own cloudy and windy sky concordant to
it. Far be it from me, then, to say, “These things should not be.” For
should I see nothing but these, I should indeed desire better; but yet,
if only for these, ought I to praise Thee; for that Thou art to be
praised is shown from the “earth, dragons, and all deeps; fire, and
hail; snow, and vapours; stormy winds fulfilling Thy word; mountains,
and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars; beasts, and all cattle;
creeping things, and flying fowl; kings of the earth, and all people;
princes, and all judges of the earth; both young men and maidens; old
men and children,” praise Thy name. But when, “from the heavens,” these
praise Thee, praise Thee, our God, “in the heights,” all Thy “angels,”
all Thy “hosts,” “sun and moon,” all ye stars and light, “the heavens of
heavens,” and the “waters that be above the heavens,” praise Thy
name. <span id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539) I did not now desire
better things, because I was thinking of all; and with a better judgment
I reflected that the things above were better than those below, but that
all were better than those above alone.
