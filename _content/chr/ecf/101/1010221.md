Be Designated.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XX-p2"></span>26. But what now is manifest and clear is,
that neither are there future nor past things. Nor is it fitly said,
“There are three times, past, present and future;” but perchance it
might be fitly said, “There are three times; a present of things past, a
present of things present, and a present of things future.” For these
three do somehow exist in the soul, and otherwise I see them not:
present of things past, memory; present of things present, sight;
present of things future, expectation. If of these things we are
permitted to speak, I see three times, and I grant there are three. It
may also be said, “There are three times, past, present and future,” as
usage falsely has it. See, I trouble not, nor gainsay, nor reprove;
provided always that which is said may be understood, that neither the
future, nor that which is past, now is. For there are but few things
which we speak properly, many things improperly; but what we may wish to
say is understood.
