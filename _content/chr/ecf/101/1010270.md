id="vi.XIII.IV-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—All Things Have Been Created by
the Grace of God, and are Not of Him as Standing in Need of Created
Things.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.IV-p2"></span>5. What, therefore, could there be
wanting unto Thy good, which Thou Thyself art, although these things had
either never been, or had remained formless,—the which Thou madest not
out of any want, but out of the plenitude of Thy goodness, restraining
them and converting them to form not as though Thy joy were perfected by
them? For to Thee, being perfect, their imperfection is displeasing, and
therefore were they perfected by Thee, and were pleasing unto Thee; but
not as if Thou wert imperfect, and wert to be perfected in their
perfection. For Thy good Spirit was borne over the waters, <span
id="fr_1177"></span>[1178](#fn_1177) not borne up by them as if He
rested upon them. For those in whom Thy good Spirit is said to
rest, <span id="fr_1178"></span>[1179](#fn_1178) He causes to rest in
Himself. But Thy incorruptible and unchangeable will, which in itself is
all-sufficient for itself, was borne over that life which Thou hadst
made, to which to live is not all one with living happily, since,
flowing in its own darkness, it liveth also; for which it remaineth to
be converted unto Him by whom it was made, and to live more and more by
“the fountain of life,” and in His light to “see light,” <span
id="fr_1179"></span>[1180](#fn_1179) and to be perfected, and
enlightened, and made happy.
