<span id="vii.1.CXCV-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXCV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 418.)

<span id="vii.1.CXCV-p3"></span>*<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXCV-p3.1"></span>To His Holy Lord and Most Blessed
Father</span>*<span class="c9"><span id="vii.1.CXCV-p3.2"></span>, <span
id="fr_2889"></span>[2890](#fn_2889) *Augustin, Jerome Sends
Greeting.*</span>

<span id="vii.1.CXCV-p5"></span>At all times I have esteemed your
Blessedness with becoming reverence and honour, and have loved the Lord
and Saviour dwelling in you. But now we add, if possible, something to
that which has already reached a climax, and we heap up what was already
full, so that we do not suffer a single hour to pass without the mention
of your name, because you have, with the ardour of unshaken faith, stood
your ground against opposing storms, and preferred, so far as this was
in your power, to be delivered from Sodom, though you should come forth
alone, rather than linger behind with those who are doomed to perish.
Your wisdom apprehends what I mean to say. Go on and prosper! You are
renowned throughout the whole world; Catholics revere and look up to you
as the restorer of the ancient faith, and—which is a token of yet more
illustrious glory—all heretics abhor you. They persecute me also with
equal hatred, seeking by imprecation to take away the life which they
cannot reach with the sword. May the mercy of Christ the Lord preserve
you in safety and mindful of me, my venerable lord and most blessed
father. <span id="fr_2890"></span>[2891](#fn_2890)

<span id="vii.1.CXCV-p6"></span> In two <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXCV-p6.1"></span>Mss.</span> this letter has, as a
postscript, the letter already translated as CXXIII.; see page 451. The
reason for that letter being supposed to belong to the year 410 is the
interpretation which some put upon one of its obscure sentences as
alluding to the fall of Rome in that year. If, however, the sentence in
question referred to the ecclesiastical difficulties disturbing
Jerusalem and all the East in connection with the Pelagian controversy,
there is nothing to forbid the conjecture which its place in the <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.1.CXCV-p6.2"></span>Mss.</span> aforesaid
suggests, namely, that it was sent at the same time as this letter, with
which in them it stands connected.
