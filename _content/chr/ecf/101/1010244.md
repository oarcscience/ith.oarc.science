<span id="vi.XII.XI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XII.XI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—What May Be Discovered to Him by
God.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.XI-p2"></span>11. Already hast Thou told me, O Lord,
with a strong voice, in my inner ear, that Thou art eternal, having
alone immortality. <span id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088) Since Thou
art not changed by any shape or motion, nor is Thy will altered by
times, because no will which changes is immortal. This in Thy sight is
clear to me, and let it become more and more clear, I beseech Thee; and
in that manifestation let me abide more soberly under Thy wings.
Likewise hast Thou said to me, O Lord, with a strong voice, in my inner
ear, that Thou hast made all natures and substances, which are not what
Thou Thyself art, and yet they are; and that only is not from Thee which
is not, and the motion of <span id="page_179">p. 179</span> <span
id="vi.XII.XI-Page_179"></span>the will from Thee who art, to that which
in a less degree is, because such motion is guilt and sin; <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089) and that no one’s sin doth either
hurt Thee, or disturb the order of Thy rule, <span
id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090) either first or last. This, in Thy
sight, is clear to me and let it become more and more clear, I beseech
Thee; and in that manifestation let me abide more soberly under Thy
wings.

<span id="vi.XII.XI-p6"></span>12. Likewise hast Thou said to me, with a
strong voice, in my inner ear, that that creature, whose will Thou alone
art, is not co-eternal unto Thee, and which, with a most persevering
purity <span id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091) drawing its support
from Thee, doth, in place and at no time, put forth its own
mutability; <span id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092) and Thyself being
ever present with it, unto whom with its entire affection it holds
itself, having no future to expect nor conveying into the past what it
remembereth, is varied by no change, nor extended into any times. <span
id="fr_1093"></span>[1094](#fn_1093) O blessed one,—if any such there
be,—in clinging unto Thy Blessedness; blest in Thee, its everlasting
Inhabitant and its Enlightener! Nor do I find what the heaven of
heavens, which is the Lord’s, can be better called than Thine house,
which contemplateth Thy delight without any defection of going forth to
another; a pure mind, most peacefully one, by that stability of peace of
holy spirits, <span id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094) the citizens of
Thy city “in the heavenly places,” above these heavenly places which are
seen. <span id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095)

<span id="vi.XII.XI-p12"></span>13. Whence the soul, whose wandering has
been made far away, may understand, if now she thirsts for Thee, if now
her tears have become bread to her, while it is daily said unto her
“Where is thy God?” <span id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096) if she
now seeketh of Thee one thing, and desireth that she may dwell in Thy
house all the days of her life. <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[1098](#fn_1097) And what is her life but Thee? And
what are Thy days but Thy eternity, as Thy years which fail not, because
Thou art the same? Hence, therefore, can the soul, which is able,
understand how far beyond all times Thou art eternal; when Thy house,
which has not wandered from Thee, although it be not co-eternal with
Thee, yet by continually and unfailingly clinging unto Thee, suffers no
vicissitude of times. This in Thy sight is clear unto me, and may it
become more and more clear unto me, I beseech Thee; and in this
manifestation may I abide more soberly under Thy wings.

<span id="vi.XII.XI-p15"></span>14. Behold, I know not what
shapelessness there is in those changes of these last and lowest
creatures. And who shall tell me, unless it be some one who, through the
emptiness of his own heart, wanders and is staggered by his own fancies?
Who, unless such a one, would tell me that (all figure being diminished
and consumed), if the formlessness only remain, through which the thing
was changed and was turned from one figure into another, that that can
exhibit the changes of times? For surely it could not be, because
without the change of motions times are not, and there is no change
where there is no figure.
