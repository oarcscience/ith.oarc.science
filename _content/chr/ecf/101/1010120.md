id="vi.VII.XII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Whatever Things the Good God
Has Created are Very Good.</span>

<span id="vi.VII.XII-p2"></span>18. And it was made clear unto me that
those things are good which yet are corrupted, which, neither were they
supremely good, nor unless they were good, could be corrupted; because
if supremely good, they were incorruptible, and if not good at all,
there was nothing in them to be corrupted. For corruption harms, but,
less it could diminish goodness, it could not harm. Either, then,
corruption harms not, which cannot be; or, what is most certain, all
which is corrupted is deprived of good. But if they be deprived of all
good, they will cease to be. For if they be, and cannot be at all
corrupted, they will become better, because they shall remain
incorruptibly. And what more monstrous than to assert that those things
which have lost all their goodness are made better? Therefore, if they
shall be deprived of all good, they shall no longer be. So long,
therefore, as they are, they are good; therefore whatsoever is, is good.
That evil, then, which I sought whence it was, is not any substance; for
were it a substance, it would be good. For either it would be an
incorruptible substance, and so a chief good, or a corruptible
substance, which unless it were good it could not be corrupted. I
perceived, therefore, and it was made clear to me, that Thou didst make
all things good, nor is there any substance at all that was not made by
Thee; and because all that Thou hast made are not equal, therefore all
things are; because individually they are good, and altogether very
good, because our God made all things very good. <span
