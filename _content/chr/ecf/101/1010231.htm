And I will be immoveable, and fixed in Thee, in my mould, Thy truth; nor will I endure the questions of men, who by a penal disease thirst for more than they can hold, and say, &#8220;What did God make before He made heaven and earth?&#8221; Or, &#8220;How came it into His mind to make anything, when He never before made anything?&#8221; Grant to them, O Lord, to think well what they say, and to see that where there is no time, they cannot say &#8220;never.&#8221; What, therefore, He is said &#8220;never to have made,&#8221; what else is it but to say, that in no time was it made? Let them therefore see that there could be no time without a created being,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1063"></A><A HREF="#fn_1063"><FONT SIZE="1">1064</FONT></A>
