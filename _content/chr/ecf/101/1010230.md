id="vi.XI.XXIX-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—That Human Life is a
Distraction But that Through the Mercy of God He Was Intent on the Prize
of His Heavenly Calling.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XXIX-p2"></span>39. But “because Thy loving-kindness is
better than life,” <span id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053) behold, my
life is but a distraction, <span id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054)
and Thy right hand upheld me <span id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055)
in my Lord, the Son of man, the Mediator between Thee, <span
id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056) The One, and us the many,—in many
distractions amid many things,—that through Him I may apprehend in whom
I have been apprehended, and may be recollected from my old days,
following The One, forgetting the things that are past; and not
distracted, but drawn on, <span id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057) not
to those things which shall be and shall pass away, but to those things
which are before, <span id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058) not
distractedly, but intently, I follow on for the prize of my heavenly
calling, <span id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059) where I may hear the
voice of Thy praise, and contemplate Thy delights, <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060) neither coming nor passing away.
But now are my years spent in mourning. <span
id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061) And Thou, O Lord, art my comfort,
my Father everlasting. But I have been divided amid times, the order of
which I know not; and my thoughts, even the inmost bowels of my soul,
are mangled with tumultuous varieties, until I flow together unto Thee,
purged and molten in the fire of Thy love. <span

earnestly pursue it. And it may be said here in view of the subject of
this book, that there is no stranger delusion than that which possesses
the idle and the worldly as to the influence of time in ameliorating
their condition. They have “good intentions,” and hope that time in the
future may do for them what it has not in the past. But in truth, time
merely affords an opportunity for energy and life to work. To quote that
lucid and nervous thinker, Bishop Copleston (*Remains*, p. 123): “One of
the commonest errors is to regard *time* as *agent*. But in reality time
*does* nothing and *is* nothing. We use it as a compendious expression
for all those causes which operate slowly and imperceptibly; but, unless
some positive cause is in action, no change takes place in the lapse of
one thousand years; *e. g.*, a drop of water encased in a cavity of
silex.”
