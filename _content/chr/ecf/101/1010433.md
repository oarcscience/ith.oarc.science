<span id="vii.1.CXLVI-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span

<span id="vii.1.CXLVI-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXLVI-p3.1"></span>To Pelagius, My Lord Greatly Beloved, and
Brother Greatly Longed For, Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CXLVI-p4"></span>I thank you very much for your
consideration in making me glad by a letter from you, and informing me
of your welfare. May the Lord recompense you with those blessings by the
possession of which you may be good for ever, and may live eternally
with Him who is eternal, my lord greatly beloved, and brother greatly
longed for. Although I do not acknowledge that anything in me deserves
the eulogies which the letter of your Benevolence contains concerning
me, nevertheless I cannot but be grateful for the goodwill therein
manifested towards one so insignificant, while suggesting at the same
time that you should rather pray for me that I may be made by the Lord
such as you suppose me already to be.

<span id="vii.1.CXLVI-p5"></span>(*In another hand*) May you enjoy
safety and the Lord’s favour, and be mindful of us! <span

<span id="vii.1.CXLVI-p6"></span> Pelagius made use of this letter at
the Council of Diospolis, in <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXLVI-p6.1"></span>A.D.</span> 415, which compelled Augustin
to vindicate himself in reference to it in his narrative of the
proceedings of Pelagius. See *Anti-Pelagian Writings,* vol. i. p. 413.
