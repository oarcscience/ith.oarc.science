<span id="vi.VIII.I-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.VIII.I-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.—He, Now Given to Divine Things,
and Yet Entangled by the Lusts of Love, Consults Simplicianus in
Reference to the Renewing of His Mind.</span>

<span id="vi.VIII.I-p2"></span>1. <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.VIII.I-p2.1"></span>O My</span> God, let me with gratitude
remember and confess unto Thee Thy mercies bestowed upon me. Let my
bones be steeped in Thy love, and let them say, Who is like unto Thee, O
Lord? <span id="fr_587"></span>[588](#fn_587) “Thou hast loosed my
bonds, I will offer unto Thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving.” <span
id="fr_588"></span>[589](#fn_588) And how Thou hast loosed them I will
declare; and all who worship Thee when they hear these things shall say:
“Blessed be the Lord in heaven and earth, great and wonderful is His
name.” Thy words had stuck fast into my breast, and I was hedged round
about by Thee on every side. <span id="fr_589"></span>[590](#fn_589) Of
Thy eternal life I was now certain, although I had seen it “through a
glass darkly.” <span id="fr_590"></span>[591](#fn_590) Yet I no longer
doubted that there was an incorruptible substance, from which was
derived all other substance; nor did I now desire to be more certain of
Thee, but more stedfast in Thee. As for my temporal life, all things
were uncertain, and my heart had to be purged from the old leaven. <span
id="fr_591"></span>[592](#fn_591) The “Way,” <span
id="fr_592"></span>[593](#fn_592) the Saviour Himself, was pleasant unto
me, but as yet I disliked to pass through its straightness. And Thou
didst put into my mind, and it seemed good in my eyes, to go unto
Simplicianus, <span id="fr_593"></span>[594](#fn_593) who appeared to me
a faithful servant of Thine, and Thy grace shone in him. I had also
heard that from his very youth he had lived most devoted to Thee. Now he
had grown into years, and by reason of so great age, passed in such
zealous following of Thy ways, he appeared to me likely to have gained
much experience; and so in truth he had. Out of which experience I
desired him to tell me (setting before him my griefs) which would be the
most fitting way for one afflicted as I was to walk in Thy way.

<span id="vi.VIII.I-p10"></span>2. For the Church I saw to be full, and
one went this way, and another that. But it was displeasing to me that I
led a secular life; yea, now that my passions had ceased to excite me as
of old with hopes of honour and wealth, a very grievous burden it was to
undergo so great a servitude. For, compared with Thy sweetness, and the
beauty of Thy house, which I loved, <span
id="fr_594"></span>[595](#fn_594) those things delighted me no longer.
But still very tenaciously was I held by the love of women; nor did the
apostle forbid me to marry, although he exhorted me to something better,
especially wishing that all men were as he himself was. <span
id="fr_595"></span>[596](#fn_595) But I, being weak, made choice of the
more agreeable place, and because of this alone was tossed up and down
in all beside, faint and languishing with withering cares, because in
other matters I was compelled, though unwilling, to agree to a married
life, to which I was given up and enthralled. I had heard from the mouth
of truth that “there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for
the kingdom of heaven’s sake;” but, saith He, “he that is able to
receive it, let him receive it.” <span id="fr_596"></span>[597](#fn_596)
Vain, assuredly, are all men in whom the knowledge of God is not, and
who could not, out of the good things which are seen, find out Him who
is good. <span id="fr_597"></span>[598](#fn_597) But I was no longer in
that vanity; I had surmounted it, and by the united testimony of Thy
whole creation had found Thee, our Creator, <span
id="fr_598"></span>[599](#fn_598) and Thy <span id="page_117">p.
117</span> <span id="vi.VIII.I-Page_117"></span>Word, God with Thee, and
together with Thee and the Holy Ghost <span
id="fr_599"></span>[600](#fn_599) one God, by whom Thou createdst all
things. There is yet another kind of impious men, who “when they knew
God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful.” <span
id="fr_600"></span>[601](#fn_600) Into this also had I fallen; but Thy
right hand held me up, <span id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601) and bore
me away, and Thou placedst me where I might recover. For Thou hast said
unto man, “Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom;” <span
id="fr_602"></span>[603](#fn_602) and desire not to seem wise, <span
id="fr_603"></span>[604](#fn_603) because, “Professing themselves to be
wise, they became fools.” <span id="fr_604"></span>[605](#fn_604) But I
had now found the goodly pearl, <span id="fr_605"></span>[606](#fn_605)
which, selling all that I had, <span id="fr_606"></span>[607](#fn_606) I
ought to have bought; and I hesitated.

most blessed Ambrose, Bishop of the Church of Milan’ (Aug. *Retract.*
ii. 1). To him St. Augustin wrote two books, *De Diversis Quæstionibus*
(*Op.* t. vi. p. 82 *sq.*), and calls him ‘father’ (*ibid.*), speaks of
his ‘fatherly affections from his most benevolent heart, not recent or
sudden, but tried and known’ (*Ep.* 37), requests his ‘remarks and
corrections of any books of his which might chance to fall into his holy
hands’ (*ibid.*) St. Ambrose mentions his ‘having traversed the whole
world, for the sake of the faith, and of acquiring divine knowledge, and
having given the whole period of this life to holy reading, night and
day: that he had an acute mind, whereby he took in intellectual studies,
and was in the habit of proving how far the books of philosophy were
gone astray from the truth,’ *Ep.* 65, sec 5, p. 1052, ed. Ben. See also
Tillemont, H. E. t. 10, Art. ‘S. Simplicien.’”—E. B. P.
