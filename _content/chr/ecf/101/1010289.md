<span id="vi.XIII.XXIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XIII.XXIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—That to Have Power Over
All Things (Ver. 26) is to Judge Spiritually of All.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XXIII-p2"></span>33. But that he judgeth all things
answers to his having dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the
fowls of the air, and over all cattle and wild beasts, and over all the
earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. For
this he doth by the discernment of his mind, whereby he perceiveth the
things “of the Spirit of God;” <span
id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378) whereas, otherwise, man being
placed in honour, had no understanding, and is compared unto the brute
beasts, and is become like unto them. <span
id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379) In Thy Church, therefore, O our
God, according to Thy grace which Thou hast accorded unto it, since we
are Thy workmanship created in good works, <span
id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380) there are not only those who are
spiritually set over, but those also who are spiritually subjected to
those placed over them; for in this manner hast Thou made man, male and
female, <span id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381) in Thy grace
spiritual, where, according to the sex of body, there is not male and
female, because neither Jew nor Greek, nor bond nor free. <span
id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382) Spiritual persons, therefore,
whether those that are set over, or those who obey, judge spiritually;
not of that spiritual knowledge which shines in the firmament, for they
ought not to judge as to an authority so sublime, nor doth it behove
them to judge of Thy Book itself, although there be something that is
not clear therein; because we submit our understanding unto it, and
esteem as certain that even that which is shut up from our sight is
rightly and truly spoken. <span id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383) For
thus man, although now spiritual and renewed in the knowledge of God
after His image that created him, ought yet to be the “doer of the law,
not the judge.” <span id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384) Neither doth
he judge of that distinction of spiritual and carnal men, who are known
to Thine eyes, O our God, and have not as yet made themselves manifest
unto us by works, that by their fruits we may know them; <span
id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385) but Thou, O Lord, dost already know
them, and Thou hast divided and hast called them in secret, before the
firmament was made. Nor doth that man, though spiritual, judge the
restless people of this world; for what hath he to do to judge them that
are without, <span id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386) knowing not
which of them may afterwards come into the sweetness of Thy grace, and
which continue in the perpetual bitterness of impiety?

<span id="vi.XIII.XXIII-p12"></span>34. Man, therefore, whom Thou hast
made after Thine own image, received not dominion over the lights of
heaven, nor over the hidden heaven itself, nor over the day and the
night, which Thou didst call before the foundation of the heaven, nor
over the gathering together of the waters, which is the sea; but he
received dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air,
and over all cattle, and over all the earth, and over all creeping
things which creep upon the earth. For He judgeth and approveth what He
findeth right, but disapproveth what He findeth amiss, whether in the
celebration of those sacraments by which are <span id="page_202">p.
202</span> <span id="vi.XIII.XXIII-Page_202"></span>initiated those whom
Thy mercy searches out in many waters; or in that in which the
Fish <span id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387) Itself is exhibited,
which, being raised from the deep, the devout earth feedeth upon; or in
the signs and expressions of words, subject to the authority of Thy
Book,—such signs as burst forth and sound from the mouth, as it were
flying under the firmament, by interpreting, expounding, discoursing,
disputing, blessing, calling upon Thee, so that the people may answer,
*Amen*. The vocal pronunciation of all which words is caused by the deep
of this world, and the blindness of the flesh, by which thoughts cannot
be seen, so that it is necessary to speak aloud in the ears; thus,
although flying fowls be multiplied upon the earth, yet they derive
their beginning from the waters. The spiritual man judgeth also by
approving what is right and reproving what he finds amiss in the works
and morals of the faithful, in their alms, as if in “the earth bringing
forth fruit;” and he judgeth of the “living soul,” rendered living by
softened affections, in chastity, in fastings, in pious thoughts; and of
those things which are perceived through the senses of the body. For it
is now said, that he should judge concerning those things in which he
has also the power of correction.

<span id="vi.XIII.XXIII-p8"></span> In his *De Civ. Dei*, xi. 3, he
defines very distinctly (as he does in other of his writings) the
knowledge received “by sight”—that is, by experience, as distinguished
from that which is received “by faith”—that is, by revelation ([2 Cor.
5.7](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#007)<span
id="vi.XIII.XXIII-p8.1"></span>). He, in common with all the Fathers who
had knowledge of the Pagan philosophy, would feel how utterly that
philosophy had failed to “find out” ([Job
11.7](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007)<span
id="vi.XIII.XXIII-p8.2"></span>) with certitude anything as to *God and
His character*,—the *Creation* of the world,—the *Atonement* wrought by
Christ,—the doctrine of the *Resurrection*, as distinguished from the
Immortality of the Soul,—our *Immortal Destiny* after death, or “*the
Restitution of all things*.” As to the knowledge of God, see Justin
Martyr’s experience in the schools of philosophy, *Dialogue with
Trypho*, ch. ii.; and on the doctrine of Creation, see p. 165, note 4.
On the “Restitution of all things,” etc., reference may be made to
Mansel’s *Gnostics*, who points out (Introd. p. 3) that “in the Greek
philosophical systems the idea of evil holds a very subordinate and
insignificant place, and that the idea of redemption seems not to be
recognised at all.” He shows further (*ibid.* p. 4), that “there is no
idea of the delivery of the creature from the bondage of corruption. The
great year of the Stoics, the commencement of the new cycle which takes
its place after the destruction of the old world, is but a repetition of
the old evil.” See also p. 164, note 2, above.
