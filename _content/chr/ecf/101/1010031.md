<span id="vi.I_1.XV-p3"></span>24. Hear my prayer, O Lord; let not my
soul faint under Thy discipline, nor let me faint in confessing unto
Thee Thy mercies, whereby Thou hast saved me from all my most
mischievous ways, that Thou mightest become sweet to me beyond all the
seductions which I used to follow; and that I may love Thee entirely,
and grasp Thy hand with my whole heart, and that Thou mayest deliver me
from every temptation, even unto the end. For lo, O Lord, my King and my
God, for Thy service be whatever useful thing I learnt as a boy—for Thy
service what I speak, and write, and count. For when I learned vain
things, Thou didst grant me Thy discipline; and my sin in taking delight
in those vanities, Thou hast forgiven me. I learned, indeed, in them
many useful words; but these may be learned in things not vain, and that
is the safe way for youths to walk in.
