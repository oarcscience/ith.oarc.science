id="vi.V.XIV-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Having Heard the Bishop, He
Perceives the Force of the Catholic Faith, Yet Doubts, After the Manner
of the Modern Academics.</span>

<span id="vi.V.XIV-p2"></span>24. For although I took no trouble to
learn what he spake, but only to hear how he spake (for that empty care
alone remained to me, despairing of a way accessible for man to Thee),
yet, together with the words which I prized, there came into my mind
also the things about which I was careless; for I could not separate
them. And whilst I opened my heart to admit “how skilfully he spake,”
there also entered with it, but gradually, “and how truly he spake!” For
first, these things also had begun to appear to me to be defensible; and
the Catholic faith, for which I had fancied nothing could be said
against the attacks of the Manichæans, I now conceived might be
maintained without presumption; especially after I had heard one or two
parts of the Old Testament explained, and often allegorically—which when
I accepted literally, I was “killed” spiritually. <span
id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426) Many places, then, of those books
having been expounded to me, I now blamed my despair in having believed
that no reply could be made to those who hated and derided <span
id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427) the Law and the Prophets. Yet I did
not then see that for that reason the Catholic way was to be held
because it had its learned advocates, who could at length, and not
irrationally, answer objections; nor that what I held ought therefore to
be condemned because both sides were equally defensible. For that way
did not appear to me to be vanquished; nor yet did it seem to me to be
victorious.

<span id="vi.V.XIV-p5"></span>25. Hereupon did I earnestly bend my mind
to see if in any way I could possibly prove the Manichæans guilty of
falsehood. Could I have realized a spiritual substance, all their
strongholds would have been beaten down, and cast utterly out of my
mind; but I could not. But yet, concerning the body of this world, and
the whole of nature, which the senses of the flesh can attain unto, I,
now more and more considering and comparing things, judged that the
greater part of the philosophers held much the more probable opinions.
So, then, after the manner of the Academics (as they are
supposed), <span id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428) doubting of
everything and fluctuating between all, I decided that the Manichæans
were to be abandoned; judging that, even while in that period of doubt,
I could not remain in a sect to which I preferred some of the
philosophers; to which philosophers, however, because they were without
the saving name of Christ, I utterly refused to commit the cure of my
fainting soul. I resolved, therefore, to be a catechumen <span
id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429) in the Catholic Church, which my
parents had commended to me, until something settled should manifest
itself to me whither I might steer my course. <span

<span id="vi.V.XIV-p4"></span> He frequently alludes to this scoffing
spirit, so characteristic of these heretics. As an example, he says (*in
Ps.* cxlvi. 13): “There has sprung up a certain accursed sect of the
Manichæans which derides the Scriptures it takes and reads. It wishes to
censure what it does not understand, and by disturbing and censuring
what it understands not, has deceived many.” See also sec. 16, and iv.
sec. 8, above.

adverts to the above experiences with a view to the conviction of his
friend Honoratus, who was then a Manichæan.
