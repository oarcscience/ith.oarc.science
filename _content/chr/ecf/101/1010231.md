id="vi.XI.XXX-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Again He Refutes the Empty
Question, “What Did God Before the Creation of the World?”</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XXX-p2"></span>40. And I will be immoveable, and fixed
in Thee, in my mould, Thy truth; nor will I endure the questions of men,
who by a penal disease thirst for more than they can hold, and say,
“What did God make before He made heaven and earth?” Or, “How came it
into His mind to make anything, when He never before made anything?”
Grant to them, O Lord, to think well what they say, and to see that
where there is no time, they cannot say “never.” What, therefore, He is
said “never to have made,” what else is it but to say, that in no time
was it made? Let them therefore see that there could be no time without
a created being, <span id="fr_1063"></span>[1064](#fn_1063) and let them
cease to speak that vanity. Let them also be extended unto those things
which are before, <span id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064) and
understand that thou, the eternal Creator of all times, art before all
times, and that no times are co-eternal with Thee, nor any creature,
even if there be any creature beyond all times.
