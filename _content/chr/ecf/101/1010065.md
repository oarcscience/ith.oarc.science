id="vi.IV.VI-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—His Friend Being Snatched Away by
Death, He Imagines that He Remains Only as Half.</span>

<span id="vi.IV.VI-p2"></span>11. But why do I speak of these things?
For this is not the time to question, but rather to confess unto Thee.
Miserable I was, and miserable is every soul fettered by the friendship
of perishable things—he is torn to pieces when he loses them, and then
is sensible of the misery which he had before ever he lost them. Thus
was it at that time with me; I wept most bitterly, and found rest in
bitterness. Thus was I miserable, and that life of misery I accounted
dearer than my friend. For though I would willingly have changed it, yet
I was even more unwilling to lose it than him; yea, I knew not whether I
was willing to lose it even for him, as is handed down to us (if not an
invention) of Pylades and Orestes, that they would gladly have died one
for another, or both together, it being worse than death to them not to
live together. But there had sprung up in me some kind of feeling, too,
contrary to this, for both exceedingly wearisome was it to me to live,
and dreadful to die, I suppose, the more I loved him, so much the more
did I hate and fear, as a most cruel enemy, that death which had robbed
me of him; and I imagined it would suddenly annihilate all men, as it
had power over him. Thus, I remember, it was with me. Behold my heart, O
my God! Behold and look into me, for I remember it well, O my Hope! who
cleansest me from the uncleanness of such affections, directing mine
eyes towards Thee, and plucking my feet out of the net. <span
id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292) For I was astonished that other
mortals lived, since he whom I loved, as if he would never die, was
dead; and I wondered still more that I, who was to him a second self,
could live when he was dead. Well did one say of his friend, “Thou half
of my soul,” <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293) for I felt that my
soul and his soul were but one soul in two bodies; <span
id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294) and, consequently, my life was a
horror to me, because I would not live in half. And therefore,
perchance, was I afraid to die, lest he should die wholly <span
id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295) whom I had so greatly loved.

<span id="vi.IV.VI-p6"></span> Augustin’s reference to this passage in
his *Retractations* is quoted at the beginning of the book. He might
have gone further than to describe his words here as *declamatio levis*,
since the conclusion is not logical.
