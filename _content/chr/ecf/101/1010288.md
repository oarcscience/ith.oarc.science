<span id="vi.XIII.XXII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XIII.XXII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—He Explains the Divine Image
(Ver. 26) of the Renewal of the Mind.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XXII-p2"></span>32. For behold, O Lord our God, our
Creator, when our affections have been restrained from the love of the
world, by which we died by living ill, and began to be a “living soul”
by living well; <span id="fr_1368"></span>[1369](#fn_1368) and Thy word
which Thou spakest by Thy apostle is made good in us, “Be not conformed
to this world;” next also follows that which Thou presently subjoinedst,
saying, “But be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind,” <span
id="fr_1369"></span>[1370](#fn_1369) —not now after your kind, as if
following your neighbour who went before you, nor as if living after the
example of a better man (for Thou hast not said, “Let man be made after
his kind,” but, “Let us make man in our image, <span id="page_201">p.
201</span> <span id="vi.XIII.XXII-Page_201"></span>after our
likeness”), <span id="fr_1370"></span>[1371](#fn_1370) that we may prove
what Thy will is. For to this purpose said that dispenser of
Thine,—begetting children by the gospel, <span
id="fr_1371"></span>[1372](#fn_1371) —that he might not always have them
“babes,” whom he would feed on milk, and cherish as a nurse; <span
id="fr_1372"></span>[1373](#fn_1372) “be ye transformed,” saith He, “by
the renewing of your mind, that he may prove what is that good, and
acceptable, and perfect will of God.” <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373) Therefore Thou sayest not, “Let man
be made,” but, “Let us make man.” Nor sayest Thou, “after his kind,”
but, after “our image” and “likeness.” Because, being renewed in his
mind, and beholding and apprehending Thy truth, man needeth not man as
his director <span id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374) that he may
imitate his kind; but by Thy direction proveth what is that good, and
acceptable, and perfect will of Thine. And Thou teachest him, now made
capable, to perceive the Trinity of the Unity, and the Unity of the
Trinity. And therefore this being said in the plural, “Let us make man,”
it is yet subjoined in the singular, “and God made man;” and this being
said in the plural, “after our likeness,” is subjoined in the singular,
“after the image of God.” <span id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375)
Thus is man renewed in the knowledge of God, after the image of Him that
created him; <span id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376) and being made
spiritual, he judgeth all things,—all things that are to be judged,—“yet
he himself is judged of no man.” <span
id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377)
