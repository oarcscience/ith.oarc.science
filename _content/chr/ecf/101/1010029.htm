<p class="c41"><a name="vi.I_1.XIII-p2"></A><span class="c2"><a name="vi.I_1.XIII-p2.1"></A>Chapter XIII.&#8212;He Delighted in Latin Studies and the Empty Fables of the Poets, But Hated the Elements of Literature and the Greek Language.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vi.I_1.XIII-p3"></A>20. But what was the cause of my dislike of Greek literature, which I studied from my boyhood, I cannot even now understand. For the Latin I loved exceedingly&#8212;not what our first masters, but what the grammarians teach; for those primary lessons of reading, writing, and ciphering, I considered no less of a burden and a punishment than Greek. Yet whence was this unless from the sin and vanity of this life? for I was &#8220;but flesh, a wind that passeth away and cometh not again.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">166</FONT></A>
 For those primary lessons were better, assuredly, because more certain; seeing that by their agency I acquired, and still retain, the power of reading what I find written, and writing myself what I will; whilst in the others I was compelled to learn about the wanderings of a certain &AElig;neas, oblivious of my own, and to weep for Biab dead, because she slew herself for love; while at the same time I brooked with dry eyes my wretched self dying far from Thee, in the midst of those things, O God, my life.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vi.I_1.XIII-p5"></A>21. For what can be more wretched than the wretch who pities not himself shedding tears over the death of Dido for love of &AElig;neas, but shedding no tears over his own death in not loving Thee, O God, light of my heart, and bread of the inner mouth of my soul, and the power that weddest my mind with my innermost thoughts? I did not love Thee, and committed fornication against Thee; and those around me thus sinning cried, &#8220;Well done! Well done!&#8221; For the friendship of this world is fornication against Thee;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">167</FONT></A>
 and &#8220;Well done! Well done!&#8221; is cried until one feels ashamed not to be such a man. And for this I shed no tears, though I wept for Dido, who sought death at the sword&#146;s point,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">168</FONT></A>
 myself the while seeking the lowest of Thy creatures&#8212;having forsaken Thee&#8212;earth tending to the earth; and if forbidden to read these things, how grieved would I feel that I was not permitted to read what grieved me. This sort of madness is considered a more honourable and more fruitful learning than that by which I learned to read and write.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vi.I_1.XIII-p8"></A>22. But now, O my God, cry unto my soul; and let Thy Truth say unto me, &#8220;It is not so; it is not so; better much was that first teaching.&#8221; For behold, I would rather forget the wanderings of &AElig;neas, and all such things, than how to write and read. But it is true that over the entrance of the grammar school there hangs a vail;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_168"></A><A HREF="#fn_168"><FONT SIZE="1">169</FONT></A>
 but this is not so much a sign of the majesty of the mystery, as of a covering for error. Let not them exclaim against me of whom I am no longer in fear, whilst I confess to Thee, my God, that which my soul desires, and acquiesce in reprehending my evil ways, that I may love Thy good ways. Neither let those cry out against me who buy or sell grammar-learning. For if I ask them whether it be true, as the poet says, that &AElig;neas once came to Carthage, the unlearned will reply that they do not know, the learned will deny it to be true. But if I ask with what letters the name &AElig;neas is written, all who have learnt this will answer truly, in accordance with the conventional understanding men have arrived at as to these signs. Again, if I should ask which, if forgotten, would cause the greatest inconvenience in our life, reading and writing, or these poetical fictions, who does not see what every one would answer who had not entirely forgotten himself? I erred, then, when as a boy I preferred those vain studies to those more profitable ones, or rather loved the one and hated the other. &#8220;One and one are two, two and two are four,&#8221; this was then in truth a hateful song to me; while the wooden horse full of armed men, and the burning of Troy, and the &#8220;spectral image&#8221; of Creusa&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_169"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">170</FONT></A>
 were a most pleasant spectacle of vanity.</p>
