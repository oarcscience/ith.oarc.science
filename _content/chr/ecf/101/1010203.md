<span id="vi.XI.II-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XI.II-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—He Begs of God that Through the
Holy Scriptures He May Be Led to Truth.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.II-p2"></span>2. But when shall I suffice with the
tongue of my pen to express all Thy exhortations, and all Thy terrors,
and comforts, and guidances, whereby Thou hast led me to preach Thy Word
and to dispense Thy Sacrament <span id="fr_1002"></span>[1003](#fn_1002)
unto Thy people? And if I suffice to utter these things in order, the
drops <span id="fr_1003"></span>[1004](#fn_1003) of time are dear to me.
Long time have I burned to meditate in Thy law, and in it to confess to
Thee my knowledge and ignorance, the beginning of Thine enlightening,
and the remains of my darkness, until infirmity be swallowed up by
strength. And I would not that to aught else those hours should flow
away, which I find free from the necessities of refreshing my body, and
the care of my mind, and of the service which we owe to men, and which,
though we owe not, even yet we pay. <span
id="fr_1004"></span>[1005](#fn_1004)

<span id="vi.XI.II-p6"></span>3. O Lord my God, hear my prayer, and let
Thy mercy regard my longing, since it bums not for myself alone, but
because it desires to benefit brotherly charity; and Thou seest into my
heart, that so it is. I would sacrifice to Thee the service of my
thought and tongue; and do Thou give what I may offer unto Thee. For “I
am poor and needy,” <span id="fr_1005"></span>[1006](#fn_1005) Thou rich
unto all that call upon Thee, <span id="fr_1006"></span>[1007](#fn_1006)
who free from care carest for us. Circumcise from all rashness and <span
id="page_164">p. 164</span> <span id="vi.XI.II-Page_164"></span>from all
lying my inward and outward lips. <span
id="fr_1007"></span>[1008](#fn_1007) Let Thy Scriptures be my chaste
delights. Neither let me be deceived in them, nor deceive out of
them. <span id="fr_1008"></span>[1009](#fn_1008) Lord, hear and pity, O
Lord my God, light of the blind, and strength of the weak; even also
light of those that see, and strength of the strong, hearken unto my
soul, and hear it crying “out of the depths.” <span
id="fr_1009"></span>[1010](#fn_1009) For unless Thine ears be present in
the depths also, whither shall we go? whither shall we cry? “The day is
Thine, and the night also is Thine.” <span
id="fr_1010"></span>[1011](#fn_1010) At Thy nod the moments flee by.
Grant thereof space for our meditations amongst the hidden things of Thy
law, nor close it against us who knock. For not in vain hast Thou willed
that the obscure secret of so many pages should be written. Nor is it
that those forests have not their harts, <span
id="fr_1011"></span>[1012](#fn_1011) betaking themselves therein, and
ranging, and walking, and feeding, lying down, and ruminating. Perfect
me, O Lord, and reveal them unto me. Behold, Thy voice is my joy, Thy
voice surpasseth the abundance of pleasures. Give that which I love, for
I do love; and this hast Thou given. Abandon not Thine own gifts, nor
despise Thy grass that thirsteth. Let me confess unto Thee whatsoever I
shall have found in Thy books, and let me hear the voice of praise, and
let me imbibe Thee, and reflect on the wonderful things of Thy
law; <span id="fr_1012"></span>[1013](#fn_1012) even from the beginning,
wherein Thou madest the heaven and the earth, unto the everlasting
kingdom of Thy holy city that is with Thee.

<span id="vi.XI.II-p15"></span>4. Lord, have mercy on me and hear my
desire. For I think that it is not of the earth, nor of gold and silver,
and precious stones, nor gorgeous apparel, nor honours and powers, nor
the pleasures of the flesh, nor necessaries for the body, and this life
of our pilgrimage; all which are added to those that seek Thy kingdom
and Thy righteousness. <span id="fr_1013"></span>[1014](#fn_1013)
Behold, O Lord my God, whence is my desire. The unrighteous have told me
of delights, but not such as Thy law, O Lord. <span
id="fr_1014"></span>[1015](#fn_1014) Behold whence is my desire. Behold,
Father, look and see, and approve; and let it be pleasing in the sight
of Thy mercy, that I may find grace before Thee, that the secret things
of Thy Word may be opened unto me when I knock. <span
id="fr_1015"></span>[1016](#fn_1015) I beseech, by our Lord Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, “the Man of Thy right hand, the Son of man, whom Thou
madest strong for Thyself,” <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1017](#fn_1016)
as Thy Mediator and ours, through whom Thou hast sought us, although not
seeking Thee, but didst seek us that we might seek Thee, <span
id="fr_1017"></span>[1018](#fn_1017) —Thy Word through whom Thou hast
made all things, <span id="fr_1018"></span>[1019](#fn_1018) and amongst
them me also, Thy Only-begotten, through whom Thou hast called to
adoption the believing people, and therein me also. I beseech Thee
through Him, who sitteth at Thy right hand, and “maketh intercession for
us,” <span id="fr_1019"></span>[1020](#fn_1019) “in whom are hid all
treasures of wisdom and knowledge.” <span
id="fr_1020"></span>[1021](#fn_1020) Him <span
id="fr_1021"></span>[1022](#fn_1021) do I seek in Thy books. Of Him did
Moses write; <span id="fr_1022"></span>[1023](#fn_1022) this saith
Himself; this saith the Truth.

<span id="vi.XI.II-p3"></span> He very touchingly alludes in *Serm.*
ccclv. 2 to the way in which he was forced against his will (as was
frequently the custom in those days), first, to become a presbyter
(<span class="c9"><span id="vi.XI.II-p3.1"></span>A.D.</span> 391), and,
four years later, coadjutor to Valerius, Bishop of Hippo (*Ep.* xxxi. 4,
and *Ep.* ccxiii. 4), whom on his death he succeeded. His own wish was
to establish a monastery, and to this end he sold his patrimony, “which
consisted of only a few small fields” (*Ep.* cxxvi. 7). He absolutely
dreaded to become a bishop, and as he knew his name was highly esteemed
in the Church, he avoided cities in which the see was vacant. His former
backsliding had made him humble; and he tells us in the sermon above
referred to, “Cavebam hoc, et agebam quantam poteram, ut in loco humili
salvarer *ne in alto periclitarer.*” Augustin also alludes to his
ordination in *Ep.* xxi., addressed to Bishop Valerius.

<span id="vi.XI.II-p4"></span> “He alludes to the hour-glasses of his
time, which went by water, as ours do now by sand.”—W. W.

<span id="fn_1004"></span>[163:1005](1010203.htm#fr_1004) <span
id="vi.XI.II-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vi.XI.II-p5"></span> Augustin, in common with other bishops,
had his time much invaded by those who sought his arbitration or
judicial decision in secular matters, and in his *De Op. Monach.* sec.
37, he says, what many who have much mental toil will readily
appreciate, that he would rather have spent the time not occupied in
prayer and the study of the Scriptures in working with his hands, as did
the monks, than have to bear these *tumultuosissimas perplexitates*. In
the year 426 we find him (*Ep.* ccxiii) designating Eraclius, in public
assembly, as his successor in the see, and to relieve him (though,
meanwhile, remaining a presbyter) of these anxious duties. See vi. sec.
15, and note 1, above; and also *ibid.* sec. 3.

id="vi.XI.II-p9.2"></span>

<span id="vi.XI.II-p10"></span> Augustin is always careful to
distinguish between the certain truths of faith and doctrine which all
may know, and the mysteries of Scripture which all have not the ability
equally to apprehend. “Among the things,” he says (*De Doctr. Christ*.
ii. 14), “that are plainly laid down in Scripture, are to be found all
matters that concern faith, and the manner of life.” As to the
Scriptures that are obscure, he is slow to come to conclusions, lest he
should “be deceived in them or deceive out of them.” In his *De Gen. ad
Lit.* i. 37, he gives a useful warning against forcing our own meaning
on Scripture in doubtful questions, and, *ibid.* viii. 5, we have the
memorable words: “Melius est dubitare de rebus occultis, quam litigare
de incertis.” For examples of how careful he is in such matters not to
go beyond what is written, see his answer to the question raised by
Evodius,—a question which reminds us of certain modern speculations (see
*The Unseen Universe*, arts. 61, 201, etc.),—whether the soul on
departing from the body has not still a body of some kind, and at least
some of the senses proper to a body; and also (*Ep.* clxiv.) his
endeavours to unravel Evodius’ difficulties as to Christ’s preaching to
the spirits in prison ([1 Pet. iii.
18-21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018)<span
id="vi.XI.II-p10.1"></span>). Similarly, he says, as to the Antichrist
of [2 Thess. ii. 1-7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001)<span
id="vi.XI.II-p10.2"></span> (*De Civ. Dei*, xx. 19): “I frankly confess
I know not what he means. I will, nevertheless, mention such conjectures
as I have heard or read.” See notes, pp. 64 and 92, above.

<span id="vi.XI.II-p13"></span> [Ps.
29.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009)<span id="vi.XI.II-p13.1"></span>.
In his comment on this place as given in the Old Version, “vox Domini
perficientis cervos,” he makes the forest with its thick darkness to
symbolize the mysteries of Scripture, where the harts ruminating thereon
represent the pious Christian meditating on those mysteries (see vi.
sec. 3, note, above). In this same passage he speaks of those who are
thus being perfected as overcoming the poisoned tongues. This is an
allusion to the fabled power the stags had of enticing serpents from
their holes by their breath, and then destroying them. Augustin is very
fond of this kind of fable from natural history. In his *Enarr. in Ps.*
cxxix. and cxli., we have similar allusions to the supposed habits of
stags; and, *ibid.* ci., we have the well-known fable of the pelican in
its charity reviving its young, and feeding them with its own blood.
This use of fables was very common with the mediæval writers, and those
familiar with the writings of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
will recall many illustrations of it amongst the preachers of those
days.
