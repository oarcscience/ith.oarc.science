God Teaches Future Things.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XIX-p2"></span>25. Thou, therefore, Ruler of Thy
creatures, what is the method by which Thou teachest souls those things
which are future? For Thou hast taught Thy prophets. What is that way by
which Thou, to whom nothing is future, dost teach future things; or
rather of future things dost teach present? For what is not, of a
certainty cannot be taught. Too far is this way from my view; it is too
mighty for me, I cannot attain unto it; <span

when Thou shalt have granted it, sweet light of my hidden eyes.
