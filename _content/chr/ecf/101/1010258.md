<span id="vi.XII.XXV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XII.XXV-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—It Behoves Interpreters, When
Disagreeing Concerning Obscure Places, to Regard God the Author of
Truth, and the Rule of Charity.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.XXV-p2"></span>34. Let no one now trouble me by saying,
Moses thought not as you say, but as I say.” For should he ask me,
“Whence knowest thou that Moses thought this which you deduce from his
words?” I ought to take it contentedly, <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[1148](#fn_1147) and reply perhaps as I have before,
or somewhat more fully should he be obstinate. But when he says, “Moses
meant not what you say, but what I say,” and yet denies not what each of
us says, and that both are true, O my God, life of the poor, in whose
bosom there is no contradiction, pour down into my heart Thy soothings,
that I may patiently bear with such as say this to me; not because they
are divine, and because they have seen in the heart of Thy servant what
they say, but because they are proud, and have not known the opinion of
Moses, but love their own,—not because it is true, but because it is
their own. Otherwise they would equally love another true opinion, as I
love what they say when they speak what is true; not because it is
theirs, but because it is true, and therefore now not theirs because
true. But if they therefore love that because it is true, it is now both
theirs and mine, since it is common to all the lovers of truth. But
because they contend that Moses meant not what I say, but I what they
themselves say, this I neither like nor love; because, though it were
so, yet that rashness is not of knowledge, but of audacity; and not
vision, but vanity brought it forth. And therefore, O Lord, are Thy
judgments to be dreaded, since Thy truth is neither mine, nor his, nor
another’s, but of all of us, whom Thou publicly callest to have it in
common, warning <span id="page_186">p. 186</span> <span
id="vi.XII.XXV-Page_186"></span>us terribly not to hold it as specially
for ourselves, lest we be deprived of it. For whosoever claims to
himself as his own that which Thou appointed to all to enjoy, and
desires that to be his own which belongs to all, is forced away from
what is common to all to that which is his own—that is, from truth to
falsehood. For he that “speaketh a lie, speaketh of his own.” <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148)

<span id="vi.XII.XXV-p5"></span>35. Hearken, O God, Thou best Judge!
Truth itself, hearken to what I shall say to this gainsayer; hearken,
for before Thee I say it, and before my brethren who use Thy law
lawfully, to the end of charity; <span
id="fr_1149"></span>[1150](#fn_1149) hearken and behold what I shall say
to him, if it be pleasing unto Thee. For this brotherly and peaceful
word do I return unto him: “If we both see that that which thou sayest
is true, and if we both see that what I say is true, where, I ask, do we
see it? Certainly not I in thee, nor thou in me, but both in the
unchangeable truth itself, <span id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150)
which is above our minds.” When, therefore, we may not contend about the
very light of the Lord our God, why do we contend about the thoughts of.
our neighbour, which we cannot so see as incommutable truth is seen;
when, if Moses himself had appeared to us and said, “This I meant,” not
so should we see it, but believe it? Let us not, then, “be puffed up for
one against the other,” <span id="fr_1151"></span>[1152](#fn_1151) above
that which is written; let us love the Lord our God with all our heart,
with all our soul, and with all our mind, and our neighbour as
ourself. <span id="fr_1152"></span>[1153](#fn_1152) As to which two
precepts of charity, unless we believe that Moses meant whatever in
these books he did mean, we shall make God a liar when we think
otherwise concerning our fellow-servants’ mind than He hath taught us.
Behold, now, how foolish it is, in so great an abundance of the truest
opinions which can be extracted from these words, rashly to affirm which
of them Moses particularly meant; and with pernicious contentions to
offend charity itself, on account of which he hath spoken all the things
whose words we endeavour to explain!
