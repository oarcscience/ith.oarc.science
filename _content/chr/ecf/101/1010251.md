id="vi.XII.XVIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—What Error is Harmless in
Sacred Scripture.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.XVIII-p2"></span>27. All which things having been heard
and considered, I am unwilling to contend about words, <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[1132](#fn_1131) for that is profitable to nothing
but to the subverting of the hearers. <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[1133](#fn_1132) But the law is good to edify, if a
man use it lawfully; <span id="fr_1133"></span>[1134](#fn_1133) for the
end of it “is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and
of faith unfeigned.” <span id="fr_1134"></span>[1135](#fn_1134) And well
did our Master know, upon which two commandments He hung all the Law and
<span id="page_183">p. 183</span> <span
id="vi.XII.XVIII-Page_183"></span>the Prophets. <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[1136](#fn_1135) And what doth it hinder me, O my
God, Thou light of my eyes in secret, while ardently confessing these
things,—since by these words many things may be understood, all of which
are yet true,—what, I say, doth it hinder me, should I think otherwise
of what the writer thought than some other man thinketh? Indeed, all of
us who read endeavour to trace out and to understand that which he whom
we read wished to convey; and as we believe him to speak truly, we dare
not suppose that he has spoken anything which we either know or suppose
to be false. Since, therefore, each person endeavours to understand in
the Holy Scriptures that which the writer understood, what hurt is it if
a man understand what Thou, the light of all true-speaking minds, dost
show him to be true although he whom he reads understood not this,
seeing that he also understood a Truth, not, however, this Truth?

<span id="vi.XII.XVIII-p7"></span> [Matt.
22.40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#040)<span
id="vi.XII.XVIII-p7.1"></span>. For he says in his *Con. Faust.* xvii.
6, remarking on [John 1.17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017)<span
id="vi.XII.XVIII-p7.2"></span>, a text which he often quotes in this
connection: “The law itself by being fulfilled becomes grace and truth.
Grace is the fulfilment of love.” And so in *ibid.* xix. 27 we read:
“From the words, ‘I came not to destroy the law but to fulfil it,’ we
are not to understand that Christ by His precepts filled up what was
wanting in the law; but what the literal command failed in doing from
the pride and disobedience of men is accomplished by grace.…So, the
apostle says, ‘faith worketh by love.’” So, again, we read in *Serm.*
cxxv.: “Quia venit dare caritatem, et caritas perficit legem; merito
dixit non veni legem solvere sed implere.” And hence in his letter to
Jerome (*Ep.* clxvii. 19), he speaks of the “royal law” as being “the
law of liberty, which is the law of love.” See p. 348, note 4, above.
