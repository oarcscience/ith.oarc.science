id="vi.XIII.XVI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—That No One But the
Unchangeable Light Knows Himself.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XVI-p2"></span>19. For altogether as Thou art, Thou
only knowest, Who art unchangeably, and knowest unchangeably, and
willest unchangeably. And Thy Essence Knoweth and Willeth unchangeably;
and Thy Knowledge Is, and Willeth unchangeably; and Thy Will Is, and
Knoweth unchangeably. Nor doth it appear just to Thee, that as the
Unchangeable Light knoweth Itself, so should It be known by that which
is enlightened and changeable. <span
id="fr_1284"></span>[1285](#fn_1284) Therefore unto Thee is my soul as
“land where no water is,” <span id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285)
because as it cannot of itself enlighten itself, so it cannot of itself
satisfy itself. For so is the fountain of life with Thee, like as in Thy
light we shall see light. <span id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286)

<span id="vi.XIII.XVI-p3"></span> See Dean Mansel on this place
(*Bampton Lectures*, lect. v. note 18), who argues that revelation is
clear and devoid of mystery when viewed as intended “for our practical
guidance,” and not as a matter of speculation. He says: “The utmost
deficiency that can be charged against human faculties amounts only to
this, that we cannot say that we know God as God knows Himself,—that the
truth of which our finite minds are susceptible may, for aught we know,
be but the passing shadow of some higher reality, which exists only in
the Infinite Intelligence.” He shows also that this deficiency pertains
to the human faculties as such, and that, whether they set themselves to
consider the things of nature or revelation. See also p. 193, note 8,
above, and notes, pp. 197, 198, below.
