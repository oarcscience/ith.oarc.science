id="vi.II_1.IX-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—It Was a Pleasure to Him Also to
Laugh When Seriously Deceiving Others.</span>

<span id="vi.II_1.IX-p2"></span>17. By what feelings, then, was I
animated? For it was in truth too shameful; and woe was me who had it.
But still what was it? “Who can understand his errors?” <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215) We laughed, because our hearts were
tickled at the thought of deceiving those who little imagined what we
were doing, and would have vehemently disapproved of it. Yet, again, why
did I so rejoice in this, that I did it not alone? Is it that no one
readily laughs alone? No one does so readily; but yet sometimes, when
men are alone by themselves, nobody being by, a fit of laughter
overcomes them when anything very droll presents itself to their senses
or mind. Yet alone I would not have done it—alone I could not at all
have done it. Behold, my God, the lively recollection of my soul is laid
bare before Thee—alone I had not committed that theft, wherein what I
stole pleased me not, but rather the act of stealing; nor to have done
it alone would I have liked so well, neither would I have done it. O
Friendship too unfriendly! thou mysterious seducer of the soul, thou
greediness to do mischief out of mirth and wantonness, thou craving for
others’ loss, without desire for my own profit or revenge; but when they
say, “Let us go, let us do it,” we are ashamed not to be shameless.
