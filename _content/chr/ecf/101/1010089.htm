<p class="c10"><a name="vi.V.XIII-p2"></A>23. When, therefore, they of Milan had sent <A NAME="page_88"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 88</FONT></A> <a name="vi.V.XIII-Page_88"></A>to Rome to the prefect of the city, to provide them with a teacher of rhetoric for their city, and to despatch him at the public expense, I made interest through those identical persons, drunk with Manich&aelig;an vanities, to be freed from whom I was going away,&#8212;neither of us, however, being aware of it,&#8212;that Symmachus, the then prefect, having proved me by proposing a subject, would send me. And to Milan I came, unto Ambrose the bishop, known to the whole world as among the best of men, Thy devout servant; whose eloquent discourse did at that time strenuously dispense unto Thy people the flour of Thy wheat, the &#8220;gladness&#8221; of Thy &#8220;oil,&#8221; and the sober intoxication of Thy &#8220;wine.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_424"></A><A HREF="#fn_424"><FONT SIZE="1">425</FONT></A>
 To him was I unknowingly led by Thee, that by him I might knowingly be led to Thee. That man of God received me like a father, and looked with a benevolent and episcopal kindliness on my change of abode. And I began to love him, not at first, indeed, as a teacher of the truth,&#8212;which I entirely despaired of in Thy Church,&#8212;but as a man friendly to myself. And I studiously hearkened to him preaching to the people, not with the motive I should, but, as it were, trying to discover whether his eloquence came up to the fame thereof, or flowed fuller or lower than was asserted; and I hung on his words intently, but of the matter I was but as a careless and contemptuous spectator; and I was delighted with the pleasantness of his speech, more erudite, yet less cheerful and soothing in manner, than that of Faustus. Of the matter, however, there could be no comparison; for the latter was straying amid Manich&aelig;an deceptions, whilst the former was teaching salvation most soundly. But &#8220;salvation is far from the wicked,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_425"></A><A HREF="#fn_425"><FONT SIZE="1">426</FONT></A>
 such as I then stood before him; and yet I was drawing nearer gradually and unconsciously.</p>
