<span id="vi.V.IV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.V.IV-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—That the Knowledge of Terrestrial
and Celestial Things Does Not Give Happiness, But the Knowledge of God
Only.</span>

<span id="vi.V.IV-p2"></span>7. Doth, then, O Lord God of truth,
whosoever knoweth those things therefore please Thee? For unhappy is the
man who knoweth all those things, but knoweth Thee not; but happy is he
who knoweth Thee, though these he may not know. <span
id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380) But he who knoweth both Thee and them
is not the happier on account of them, but is happy on account of Thee
only, if knowing Thee he glorify Thee as God, and gives thanks, and
becomes not vain in his thoughts. <span
id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381) But as he is happier who knows how to
possess a tree, and for the use thereof renders thanks to Thee, although
he may not know how many cubits high it is, or how wide it spreads, than
he that measures it and counts all its branches, and neither owns it nor
knows or loves its Creator; so a just man, whose is the entire world of
wealth, <span id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382) and who, as having
nothing, yet possesseth all things <span
id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383) by cleaving unto Thee, to whom all
things are subservient, though he know not even the circles of the Great
Bear, yet it is foolish to doubt but that he may verily be better than
he who can measure the heavens, and number the stars, and weigh the
elements, but is forgetful of Thee, “who hast set in order all things in
number, weight, and measure.” <span id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384)

<span id="vi.V.IV-p3"></span> What a contrast does his attitude here
present to his supreme regard for secular learning before his
conversion! We have constantly in his writings expressions of the same
kind. On [Psalm ciii.](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#000)<span
id="vi.V.IV-p3.1"></span> he dilates lovingly on the fount of happiness
the word of God is, as compared with the writings of Cicero, Tully, and
Plato; and again on [Psalm
xxxviii.](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#000)<span
id="vi.V.IV-p3.2"></span> he shows that the word is the source of all
true joy. So likewise in *De Trin.* iv. 1: “That mind is more
praiseworthy which knows even its own weakness, than that which, without
regard to this, searches out and even comes to know the ways of the
stars, or which holds fast such knowledge already acquired, while
ignorant of the way by which itself to enter into its own proper health
and strength.…Such a one has preferred to know his own weakness, rather
than to know the walls of the world, the foundations of the earth, and
the pinnacles of heaven.” See iii. sec. 9, note, above.
