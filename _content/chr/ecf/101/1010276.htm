<p class="c10"><a name="vi.XIII.X-p2"></A>11. Happy creature, which, though in itself it was other than Thou, hath known no other state than that as soon as it was made, it was, without any interval of time, by Thy Gift, which is borne over everything mutable, raised up by that calling whereby Thou saidst, &#8220;Let there be light, and there was light.&#8221; Whereas in us there is a difference of times, in that we were darkness, and are made light;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1200"></A><A HREF="#fn_1200"><FONT SIZE="1">1201</FONT></A>
 but of that it is only said what it would have been had it not been enlightened.

Let him who is able understand this; and let him who is not,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1201"></A><A HREF="#fn_1201"><FONT SIZE="1">1202</FONT></A>
 ask of Thee. Why should he trouble me, as if I could enlighten any &#8220;man that cometh into the world?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1202"></A><A HREF="#fn_1202"><FONT SIZE="1">1203</FONT></A>
