id="vi.XIII.XXVIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—He Proceeds to the Last
Verse, “All Things are Very Good,”—That Is, the Work Being Altogether
Good.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XXVIII-p2"></span>43. And Thou, O God, sawest
everything that Thou hadst made, and behold it was very good. <span
id="fr_1416"></span>[1417](#fn_1416) So we also see the same, and behold
all are very good. In each particular kind of Thy works, when Thou hadst
said, “Let them be made,” and they were made, Thou sawest that it was
good. Seven times have I counted it written that Thou sawest that that
which Thou madest was “good;” and this is the eighth, that Thou sawest
all things that Thou hadst made, and behold they are not only good, but
also “very good,” as being now taken together. For individually they
were only good, but all taken together they were both good and very
good. All beautiful bodies also express this; for a body which consists
of members, all of which are beautiful, is by far more beautiful than
the several members individually are by whose well-ordered union the
whole is completed, though these members also be severally
beautiful. <span id="fr_1417"></span>[1418](#fn_1417)
