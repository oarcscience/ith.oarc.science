id="vi.XIII.VI-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Why the Holy Ghost Should Have
Been Mentioned After the Mention of Heaven and Earth.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.VI-p2"></span>7. But what was the cause, O Thou
true-speaking Light? Unto Thee do I lift up my heart, let it not teach
me vain things; disperse its darkness, and tell me, I beseech Thee, by
our mother charity, tell me, I beseech Thee, the reason why, after the
mention of heaven, and of the earth invisible and formless, and darkness
upon the deep, Thy Scripture should then at length mention Thy Spirit?
Was it because it was meet that it should be spoken of Him that He was
“borne over,” and this could not be said, unless that were first
mentioned “over” which Thy Spirit may be understood to have been
“borne?” For neither was He “borne over” <span id="page_192">p.

Son, nor could it rightly be said that He was “borne over” if He were
“borne over” nothing. That, therefore, was first to be spoken of “over”
which He might be “borne;” and then He, whom it was not meet to mention
otherwise than as having been “borne.” Why, then, was it not meet that
it should otherwise be mentioned of Him, than as having been “borne
over?”
