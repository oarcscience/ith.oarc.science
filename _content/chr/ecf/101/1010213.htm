<p class="c10"><a name="vi.XI.XII-p2"></A>14. Behold, I answer to him who asks, &#8220;What was God doing before He made heaven and earth?&#8221; I answer not, as a certain person is reported to have done facetiously (avoiding the pressure of the question), &#8220;He was preparing hell,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;for those who pry into mysteries.&#8221; It is one thing to perceive, another to laugh,&#8212;these things I answer not. For more willingly would I have answered, &#8220;I know not what I know not,&#8221; than that I should make him a laughing-stock who asketh deep things, and gain praise as one who answereth false things. But I say that Thou, our God, art the Creator of every creature; and if by the term &#8220;heaven and earth&#8221; every creature is understood, I boldly say, &#8220;That before God made heaven and earth, He made not anything. For if He did, what did He make unless the creature?&#8221; And would that I knew whatever I desire to know to my advantage, as I know that no creature was made before any creature was made.</p>
