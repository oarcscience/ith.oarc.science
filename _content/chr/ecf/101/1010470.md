<span id="vii.1.CCXXXVII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CCXXXVII-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXXXVII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXVII-p2"></span>This letter was addressed to
Ceretius, a bishop, who had sent to Augustin certain apocryphal
writings, on which the Spanish heretical sect called
Priscillianists <span id="fr_3009"></span>[3010](#fn_3009) founded some
of their doctrines. Ceretius had especially directed his attention to a
hymn which they alleged to have been composed by the Lord Jesus Christ,
and given by Him to His disciples on that night on which He was
betrayed, when they sang an “hymn” before going out to the Mount of
Olives. The length of the letter precludes its insertion here, but we
believe it will interest many to read the few lines of this otherwise
long-forgotten hymn, which Augustin has here preserved. They are as
follows:—

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXVII-p4"></span>“Salvare volo et salvari volo;

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXVII-p5"></span>Solvere volo et solvi volo;

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXVII-p6"></span>Ornare volo et ornari volo;

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXVII-p7"></span>Generari volo;

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXVII-p8"></span>Cantare volo, saltate cuncti:

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXVII-p9"></span>Plangere volo, tundite vos omnes:

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXVII-p10"></span>Lucerna sum tibi, ille qui me
vides;

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXVII-p11"></span>Janua sum tibi, quicunque me
pulsas;

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXVII-p12"></span>Qui vides quod ago, tace opera mea;

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXVII-p13"></span>Verbo illusi cuncta et non sum
illusus in totum.”

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXVII-p14"></span>The reader who ponders these
extracts, and remembers the occasion on which the hymn is alleged to
have been composed, will agree with us that Augustin employs a very
unnecessary fulness of argument in devoting several paragraphs to
demolish the claims advanced on its behalf as a revelation more profound
and sacred than anything contained in the canonical Scriptures. Augustin
also brings against the Priscillianists the charge of justifying perjury
when it might be of service in concealing their real opinions, and
quotes a line in which, as he had heard from some who once belonged to
that sect, the lawfulness of such deceitful conduct was taught:—

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXVII-p15"></span>“Jura, perjura, secretum prodere
noli.”
