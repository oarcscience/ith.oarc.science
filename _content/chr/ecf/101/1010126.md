id="vi.VII.XVIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Jesus Christ, the Mediator,
is the Only Way of Safety.</span>

<span id="vi.VII.XVIII-p2"></span>24. And I sought a way of acquiring
strength sufficient to enjoy Thee; but I found it not until I embraced
that “Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus,” <span
id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550) “who is over all, God blessed for
ever,” <span id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551) calling unto me, and
saying, “I am the way, the truth, and the life,” <span
id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552) and mingling that food which I was
unable to receive with our flesh. For “the Word was made flesh,” <span
id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553) that Thy wisdom, by which Thou
createdst all things, might provide milk for our infancy. For I did not
grasp my Lord Jesus,—I, though humbled, grasped not the humble
One; <span id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554) nor did I know what lesson
that infirmity of His would teach us. For Thy Word, the Eternal Truth,
pre-eminent above the higher parts of Thy creation, raises up those that
are subject unto Itself; but in this lower world built for Itself a
humble habitation of our clay, whereby He intended to abase from
themselves such as would be subjected and bring them over unto Himself,
allaying their swelling, and fostering their love; to the end that they
might go on no further in self-confidence, but rather should become
weak, seeing before their feet the Divinity weak by taking our “coats of
skins;” <span id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555) and wearied, might cast
themselves down upon It, and It rising, might lift them up.

of skin” symbolize the mortality to which our first parents became
subject by being deprived of the tree of life (see iv. sec. 15, note 3,
above); and in his *Enarr. in Ps.* (ciii. 1, 8), he says they are thus
symbolical inasmuch as the skin is only taken from animals when dead.
