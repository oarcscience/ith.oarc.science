<span id="vi.XII.XXVII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XII.XXVII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—The Style of Speaking in
the Book of Genesis is Simple and Clear.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.XXVII-p2"></span>37. For as a fountain in a limited
space is more plentiful, and affords supply for more streams over larger
spaces than any one of those streams which, after a wide interval, is
derived from the same fountain; so the narrative of Thy dispenser,
destined to benefit many who were likely to discourse thereon, does,
from a limited measure of language, overflow into streams of clear
truth, whence each one may draw out for himself that truth which he can
concerning these subjects,—this one that truth, that one another, by
larger circumlocutions of discourse. For some, when they read or hear
these words, think that God as a man or some mass gifted with immense
power, by some new and sudden resolve, had, outside itself, as if at
distant places, created heaven and earth, two great bodies above and
below, wherein all things were to be contained. And when they hear, God
said, Let it be made, and it was made, they think of words begun and
ended, sounding in times and passing away, after the departure of which
that came into being which was commanded to be; and whatever else of the
kind their familiarity with the world <span
id="fr_1154"></span>[1155](#fn_1154) would suggest. In whom, being as
yet little ones, <span id="fr_1155"></span>[1156](#fn_1155) while their
weakness by this humble kind of speech is carried on as if in a mother’s
bosom, their faith is healthfully built <span id="page_187">p.
187</span> <span id="vi.XII.XXVII-Page_187"></span>up, by which they
have and hold as certain that God made all natures, which in wondrous
variety their senses perceive on every side. Which words, if any one
despising them, as if trivial, with proud weakness shall have stretched
himself beyond his fostering cradle, he will, alas, fall miserably. Have
pity, O Lord God, lest they who pass by trample on the unfledged bird;
and send Thine angel, who may restore it to its nest that it may live
until it can fly. <span id="fr_1156"></span>[1157](#fn_1156)
