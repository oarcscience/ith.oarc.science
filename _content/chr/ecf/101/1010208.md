id="vi.XI.VII-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—By His Co-Eternal Word He
Speaks, and All Things are Done.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.VII-p2"></span>9. Thou callest us, therefore, to
understand the Word, God with Thee, God, <span
id="fr_1031"></span>[1032](#fn_1031) which is spoken eternally, and by
it are all things spoken eternally. For what was spoken was not
finished, and another spoken until all were spoken; but all things at
once and for ever. For otherwise have we time and change, and not a true
eternity, nor a true immortality. This I know, O my God, and give
thanks. I know, I confess to Thee, O Lord, and whosoever is not
unthankful to certain truth, knows and blesses Thee with me. We know, O
Lord, we know; since in proportion as anything is not what it was, and
is what it was not, in that proportion does it die and arise. Not
anything, therefore, of Thy Word giveth place and cometh into place
again, because it is truly immortal and eternal. And, therefore, unto
the Word co-eternal with Thee, Thou dost at once and for ever say all
that Thou dost say; and whatever Thou sayest shall be made, is made; nor
dost Thou make otherwise than by speaking; yet all things are not made
both together and everlasting which Thou makest by speaking.
