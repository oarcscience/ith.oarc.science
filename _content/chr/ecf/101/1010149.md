id="vi.IX.VI-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—He is Baptized at Milan with
Alypius and His Son Adeodatus. The Book “De Magistro.”</span>

<span id="vi.IX.VI-p2"></span>14. Thence, when the time had arrived at
which I was to give in my name, <span id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752)
having left the country, we returned to Milan. Alypius also was pleased
to be born again with me in Thee, being now clothed with the humility
appropriate to Thy sacraments, and being so brave a tamer of the body,
as with unusual fortitude to tread the frozen soil of Italy with his
naked feet. We took into our company the boy Adeodatus, born of me
carnally, of my sin. Well hadst Thou made him. He was barely <span
id="page_134">p. 134</span> <span id="vi.IX.VI-Page_134"></span>fifteen
years, yet in wit excelled many grave and learned men. <span
id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753) I confess unto Thee Thy gifts, O Lord
my God, Creator of all, and of exceeding power to reform our
deformities; for of me was there naught in that boy but the sin. For
that we fostered him in Thy discipline, Thou inspiredst us, none
other,—Thy gifts I confess unto Thee. There is a book of ours, which is
entitled *The Master*. <span id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754) It is a
dialogue between him and me. Thou knowest that all things there put into
the mouth of the person in argument with me were his thoughts in his
sixteenth year. Many others more wonderful did I find in him. That
talent was a source of awe to me. And who but Thou could be the worker
of such marvels? Quickly didst Thou remove his life from the earth; and
now I recall him to mind with a sense of security, in that I fear
nothing for his childhood or youth, or for his whole self. We took him
coeval with us in Thy grace, to be educated in Thy discipline; and we
were baptized, <span id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755) and solicitude
about our past life left us. Nor was I satiated in those days with the
wondrous sweetness of considering the depth of Thy counsels concerning
the salvation of the human race. How greatly did I weep in Thy hymns and
canticles, deeply moved by the voices of Thy sweet-speaking Church! The
voices flowed into mine ears, and the truth was poured forth into my
heart, whence the agitation of my piety overflowed, and my tears ran
over, and blessed was I therein.

<span id="vi.IX.VI-p3"></span> “They were baptized at Easter, and gave
up their names before the second Sunday in Lent, the rest of which they
were to spend in fasting, humility, prayer, and being examined in the
scrutinies (Tertull. *Lib. de Bapt.* c. 20). Therefore went they to
Milan, that the bishop might see their preparation. Adjoining to the
cathedrals were there certain lower houses for them to lodge and be
exercised in, till the day of baptism” (Euseb. x. 4).—W. W. See also
Bingham, x. 2, sec. 6; and above, note 4, p. 89; note 4, p. 118, and
note 8, p. 118.

<span id="vi.IX.VI-p4"></span> In his *De Vita Beata*, sec. 6, he makes
a similar illusion to the genius of Adeodatus.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[134:755](1010149.htm#fr_754) <span
id="vi.IX.VI-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vi.IX.VI-p5"></span> This book, in which he and his son are
the interlocutors, will be found in vol. i. of the Benedictine edition,
and is by the editors assumed to be written about <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.IX.VI-p5.1"></span> A.D.</span> 389. Augustin briefly gives its
argument in his *Retractations*, i. 12. He says: “There it is disputed,
sought, and discovered that there is no master who teaches man knowledge
save God, as it is written in the gospel ([Matt.
23.10](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#010)<span
id="vi.IX.VI-p5.2"></span>), ‘One is your Master, even Christ.’”

id="vi.IX.VI-p5.3"></span>

<span id="vi.IX.VI-p6"></span> He was baptized by Ambrose, and tradition
says, as he came out of the water, they sang alternate verses of the *Te
Deum* (ascribed by some to Ambrose), which, in the old offices of the
English Church is called “The Song of Ambrose and Augustin.” In his
*Con. Julian. Pelag.* i. 10, he speaks of Ambrose as being one whose
devoted labours and perils were known throughout the whole Roman world,
and says: “In Christo enim Jesu per evangelium ipse me genuit, et eo
Christi ministro lavacrum regenerationis accepti.” See also the last
sec. of his *De Nupt. et Concup.*, and *Ep.* cxlvii. 23. In notes 3, p.
50, and 4, p. 89, will be found references to the usages of the early
Church as to baptism.
