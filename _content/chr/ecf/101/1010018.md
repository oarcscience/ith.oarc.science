id="vi.I_1.II-p2.1"></span>Chapter II.—That the God Whom We Invoke is in
Us, and We in Him.</span>

<span id="vi.I_1.II-p3"></span>2. And how shall I call upon my God—my
God and my Lord? For when I call on Him I ask Him to come into me. And
what place is there in me into which my God can come—into which God can
come, even He who made heaven and earth? Is there anything in me, O Lord
my God, that can contain Thee? Do indeed the very heaven and the earth,
which Thou hast made, and in which Thou hast made me, <span
id="page_46">p. 46</span> <span id="vi.I_1.II-Page_46"></span>contain
Thee? Or, as nothing could exist without Thee, doth whatever exists
contain Thee? Why, then, do I ask Thee to come into me, since I indeed
exist, and could not exist if Thou wert not in me? Because I am not yet
in hell, though Thou art even there; for “if I go down into hell Thou
art there.” <span id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128) I could not
therefore exist, could not exist at all, O my God, unless Thou wert in
me. Or should I not rather say, that I could not exist unless I were in
Thee from whom are all things, by whom are all things, in whom are all
things? <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129) Even so, Lord; even so.
Where do I call Thee to, since Thou art in me, or whence canst Thou come
into me? For where outside heaven and earth can I go that from thence my
God may come into me who has said, I fill heaven and earth”? <span
