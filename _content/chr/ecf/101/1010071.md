<span id="vi.IV.XII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.IV.XII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Love is Not Condemned, But Love
in God, in Whom There is Rest Through Jesus Christ, is to Be
Preferred.</span>

<span id="vi.IV.XII-p2"></span>18. If souls please thee, let them be
loved in God; for they also are mutable, but in Him <span
id="page_74">p. 74</span> <span id="vi.IV.XII-Page_74"></span>are they
firmly established, else would they pass, and pass away. In Him, then,
let them be beloved; and draw unto Him along with thee as many souls as
thou canst, and say to them, “Him let us love, Him let us love; He
created these, nor is He far off. For He did not create them, and then
depart; but they are of Him, and in Him. Behold, there is He wherever
truth is known. He is within the very heart, but yet hath the heart
wandered from Him. Return to your heart, <span
id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313) O ye transgressors, <span
id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314) and cleave fast unto Him that made
you. Stand with Him, and you shall stand fast. Rest in Him, and you
shall be at rest. Whither go ye in rugged paths? Whither go ye? The good
that you love is from Him; and as it has respect unto Him it is both
good and pleasant, and justly shall it be embittered, <span
id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315) because whatsoever cometh from Him is
unjustly loved if He be forsaken for it. Why, then, will ye wander
farther and farther in these difficult and toilsome ways? There is no
rest where ye seek it. Seek what ye seek; but it is not there where ye
seek. Ye seek a blessed life in the land of death; it is not there. For
could a blessed life be where life itself is not?”

<span id="vi.IV.XII-p6"></span>19. But our very Life descended hither,
and bore our death, and slew it, out of the abundance of His own life;
and thundering He called loudly to us to return hence to Him into that
secret place whence He came forth to us—first into the Virgin’s womb,
where the human creature was married to Him,—our mortal flesh, that it
might not be for ever mortal,—and thence “as a bridegroom coming out of
his chamber, rejoicing as a strong man to run a race.” <span
id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316) For He tarried not, but ran crying out
by words, deeds, death, life, descent, ascension, crying aloud to us to
return to Him. And He departed from our sight, that we might return to
our heart, and there find Him. For He departed, and behold, He is here.
He would not be long with us, yet left us not; for He departed thither,
whence He never departed, because “the world was made by Him.” <span
id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317) And in this world He was, and into
this world He came to save sinners, <span
id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318) unto whom my soul doth confess, that
He may heal it, for it hath sinned against Him. <span
id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319) O ye sons of men, how long so slow of
heart? <span id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320) Even now, after the Life
is descended to you, will ye not ascend and live? <span
id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321) But whither ascend ye, when ye are on
high, and set your mouth against the heavens? <span
id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322) Descend that ye may ascend, <span
id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323) and ascend to God. For ye have fallen
by “ascending against Him.” Tell them this, that they may weep in the
valley of tears, <span id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324) and so draw
them with thee to God, because it is by His Spirit that thou speakest
thus unto them, if thou speakest burning with the fire of love.

<span id="vi.IV.XII-p3"></span> Augustin is never weary of pointing out
that there is a *lex occulta* (*in Ps.* lvii. sec. 1), a law written on
the heart, which cries to those who have forsaken the written law,
“Return to your hearts, ye transgressors.” In like manner he interprets
(*De Serm. Dom. in Mon.* ii. sec. 11) “Enter into thy closet,” of the
heart of man. The door is the gate of the senses through which carnal
thoughts enter into the mind. We are to shut the door, because the devil
(*in Ps.* cxli. 3) *si clausum invenerit transit*. In sec. 16, above,
the figure is changed, and we are to fear lest these objects of sense
render us “deaf in the ear of our heart” with the tumult of our folly.
Men will not, he says, go back into their hearts, because the heart is
full of sin, and they fear the reproaches of conscience, just (*in Ps*.
xxxiii. 5) “as those are unwilling to enter their houses who have
troublesome wives.” These outer things, which too often draw us away
from Him, God intends should lift us up to Him who is better than they,
though they could all be ours at once, since He made them all; and
“woe,” he says (*De Lib. Arb*. ii. 16), “to them who love the
indications of Thee rather than Thee, and remember not what these
indicated.”

<span id="vi.IV.XII-p12"></span> “The Son of God,” says Augustin in
another place, “became a son of man, that the sons of men might be made
sons of God.” He put off the *form* of God—that by which He manifested
His divine glory in heaven—and put on the “form of a servant” ([Phil.
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007)<span id="vi.IV.XII-p12.1"></span>),
that as the outshining \[<span class="Greek"><span

([Heb. 1.3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003)<span
id="vi.IV.XII-p12.3"></span>) He might draw us to Himself. He descended
and emptied Himself of His dignity that we might ascend, giving an
example for all time (*in Ps.* xxxiii. sec. 4); for, “lest man should
disdain to imitate a humble man, God humbled Himself, so that the pride
of the human race might not disdain *to walk in the footsteps of God.*”
See also v. sec. 5, note, below.

<span id="vi.IV.XII-p14"></span> “There is something in humility which,
strangely enough, exalts the heart, and something in pride which debases
it. This seems, indeed, to be contradictory, that loftiness should
debase and lowliness exalt. But pious humility enables us to submit to
what is above us; and nothing is more exalted above us than God; and
therefore humility, by making us subject to God, exalts us.”—*De Civ.
Dei*, xiv. sec. 13.
