id="vi.VII.XX-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—He Rejoices that He Proceeded
from Plato to the Holy Scriptures, and Not the Reverse.</span>

<span id="vi.VII.XX-p2"></span>26. But having then read those books of
the <span id="page_114">p. 114</span> <span
id="vi.VII.XX-Page_114"></span>Platonists, and being admonished by them
to search for incorporeal truth, I saw Thy invisible things, understood
by those things that are made; <span id="fr_561"></span>[562](#fn_561)
and though repulsed, I perceived what that was, which through the
darkness of my mind I was not allowed to contemplate,—assured that Thou
wert, and wert infinite, and yet not diffused in space finite or
infinite; and that Thou truly art, who art the same ever, <span
id="fr_562"></span>[563](#fn_562) varying neither in part nor motion;
and that all other things are from Thee, on this most sure ground alone,
that they are. Of these things was I indeed assured, yet too weak to
enjoy Thee. I chattered as one well skilled; but had I not sought Thy
way in Christ our Saviour, I would have proved not skilful, but ready to
perish. For now, filled with my punishment, I had begun to desire to
seem wise; yet mourned I not, but rather was puffed up with
knowledge. <span id="fr_563"></span>[564](#fn_563) For where was that
charity building upon the “foundation” of humility, “which is Jesus
Christ”? <span id="fr_564"></span>[565](#fn_564) Or, when would these
books teach me it? Upon these, therefore, I believe, it was Thy pleasure
that I should fall before I studied Thy Scriptures, that it might be
impressed on my memory how I was affected by them; and that afterwards
when I was subdued by Thy books, and when my wounds were touched by Thy
healing fingers, I might discern and distinguish what a difference there
is between presumption and confession,—between those who saw whither
they were to go, yet saw not the way, and the way which leadeth not only
to behold but to inhabit the blessed country. <span
id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565) For had I first been moulded in Thy
Holy Scriptures, and hadst Thou, in the familiar use of them, grown
sweet unto me, and had I afterwards fallen upon those volumes, they
might perhaps have withdrawn me from the solid ground of piety; or, had
I stood firm in that wholesome disposition which I had thence imbibed, I
might have thought that it could have been attained by the study of
those books alone.

<span id="vi.VII.XX-p7"></span> We have already quoted a passage from
Augustin’s *Sermons* (v. sec. 5, note 7, above), where Christ as God is
described as the country we seek, while as man He is the way to go to
it. The Fathers frequently point out in their controversies with the
philosophers that it little profited that they should know of a goal to
be attained unless they could learn the *way* to reach it. And, in
accordance with the sentiment, Augustin says: “For it is as man that He
is the Mediator and the Way. Since, if the way lieth between him who
goes and the place whither he goes, there is hope of his reaching it;
but if there be no way, or if he know not where it is, what boots it to
know whither he should go?” (*De Civ. Dei*, xi. 2.) And again, in his
*De Trin.* iv. 15: “But of what use is it for the proud man, who, on
that account, is ashamed to embark upon the ship of wood, to behold from
afar his country beyond the sea? Or how can it hurt the humble man not
to behold it from so great a distance, when he is actually coming to it
by that wood upon which the other disdains to be borne?”
