<p class="c10"><a name="vi.X.III-p2"></A>3. What then have I to do with men, that they should hear my confessions, as if they were going to cure all my diseases?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_820"></A><A HREF="#fn_820"><FONT SIZE="1">821</FONT></A>
 A people curious to know the lives of others, but slow to correct their own. Why do they desire to hear from me what I am, who are unwilling to hear from Thee what they are? And how can they tell, when they hear from me of myself, whether I speak the truth, seeing that no man knoweth what is in man, &#8220;save the spirit of man which is in him &#8220;?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_821"></A><A HREF="#fn_821"><FONT SIZE="1">822</FONT></A>
 But if they hear from Thee aught concerning themselves, they will not be able to say, &#8220;The Lord lieth.&#8221; For what is it to hear from Thee of themselves, but to know themselves? And who is he that knoweth himself and saith, &#8220;It is false,&#8221; unless he himself lieth? But because &#8220;charity believeth all things&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_822"></A><A HREF="#fn_822"><FONT SIZE="1">823</FONT></A>
 (amongst those at all events whom by union with itself it maketh one), I too, O Lord, also so confess unto Thee that men may hear, to whom I cannot prove whether I confess the truth, yet do they believe me whose ears charity openeth unto me.</p><A NAME="page_143"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 143</FONT></A> <a name="vi.X.III-Page_143"></A>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vi.X.III-p6"></A>4. But yet do Thou, my most secret Physician, make clear to me what fruit I may reap by doing it. For the confessions of my past sins,&#8212;which Thou hast &#8220;forgiven&#8221; and &#8220;covered,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_823"></A><A HREF="#fn_823"><FONT SIZE="1">824</FONT></A>
 that Thou mightest make me happy in Thee, changing my soul by faith and Thy sacrament,&#8212;when they are read and heard, stir up the heart, that it sleep not in despair and say, &#8220;I cannot;&#8221; but that it may awake in the love of Thy mercy and the sweetness of Thy grace, by which he that is weak is strong,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_824"></A><A HREF="#fn_824"><FONT SIZE="1">825</FONT></A>
 if by it he is made conscious of his own weakness. As for the good, they take delight in hearing of the past errors of such as are now freed from them; and they delight, not because they are errors, but because they have been and are so no longer. For what fruit, then, O Lord my God, to whom my conscience maketh her daily confession, more confident in the hope of Thy mercy than in her own innocency,&#8212;for what fruit, I beseech Thee, do I confess even to men in Thy presence by this book what I am at this time, not what I have been? For that fruit I have both seen and spoken of, but what I am at this time, at the very moment of making my confessions, divers people desire to know, both who knew me and who knew me not,&#8212;who have heard of or from me,&#8212;but their ear is not at my heart, where I am whatsoever I am. They are desirous, then, of hearing me confess what I am within, where they can neither stretch eye, nor ear, nor mind; they desire it as those willing to believe,&#8212;but will they understand? For charity, by which they are good, says unto them that I do not lie in my confessions, and she in them believes me.</p>
