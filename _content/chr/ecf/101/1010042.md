<span id="vi.II_1.VII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.II_1.VII-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—He Gives Thanks to God for the
Remission of His Sins, and Reminds Every One that the Supreme God May
Have Preserved Us from Greater Sins.</span>

<span id="vi.II_1.VII-p2"></span>15. “What shall I render unto the
Lord,” <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211) that whilst my memory
recalls these things my soul is not appalled at them? I will love Thee,
O Lord, and thank Thee, and confess unto Thy name, <span
id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212) because Thou hast put away from me
these so wicked and nefarious acts of mine. To Thy grace I attribute it,
and to Thy mercy, that Thou hast melted away my sin as it were ice. To
Thy grace also I attribute whatsoever of evil I have not committed; for
what might I not have committed, loving as I did the sin for the sin’s
sake? Yea, all I confess to have been pardoned me, both those which I
committed by my own perverseness, and those which, by Thy guidance, I
committed not. Where is he who, reflecting upon his own infirmity, dares
to ascribe his chastity and innocency to his own strength, so that he
should love Thee the less, as if he had been in less need of Thy mercy,
whereby Thou dost forgive the transgressions of those that turn to Thee?
For whosoever, called by Thee, obeyed Thy voice, and shunned those
things which he reads me recalling and confessing of myself, let him not
despise me, who, being sick, was healed by that same Physician <span
id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213) by whose aid it was that he was not
sick, or rather was less sick. And for this let him love Thee as much,
yea, all the more, since by whom he sees me to have been restored from
so great a feebleness of sin, by Him he sees himself from a like
feebleness to have been preserved.
