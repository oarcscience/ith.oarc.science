id="vi.XIII.VIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—That Nothing Whatever, Short
of God, Can Yield to the Rational Creature a Happy Rest.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.VIII-p2"></span>9. The angels fell, the soul of man
fell <span id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187) and they have thus
indicated the abyss in that dark deep, ready for the whole spiritual
creation, unless Thou hadst said from the beginning, “Let there be
light,” and there had been light, and every obedient intelligence of Thy
celestial City had cleaved to Thee, and rested in Thy Spirit, which
unchangeably is “borne over” everything changeable. Otherwise, even the
heaven of heavens itself would have been a darksome deep, whereas now it
is light in the Lord. For even in that wretched restlessness of the
spirits who fell away, and, when unclothed of the garments of Thy light,
discovered their own darkness, dost Thou sufficiently disclose how noble
Thou hast made the rational creature; to which nought which is inferior
to Thee will suffice to yield a happy rest, <span
id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188) and so not even herself. For Thou,
O our God, shalt enlighten our darkness; <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[1190](#fn_1189) from Thee are derived our garments
of light, <span id="fr_1190"></span>[1191](#fn_1190) and then shall our
darkness be as the noonday. <span id="fr_1191"></span>[1192](#fn_1191)
Give Thyself unto me, O my God, restore Thyself unto me; behold, I love
Thee, and if it be too little, let me love Thee more strongly. I cannot
measure my love, so that I may come to know how much there is yet
wanting in me, ere my life run into Thy embracements, and not be turned
away until it be hidden in the secret place of Thy Presence. <span
id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192) This only I know, that woe is me
except in Thee,—not only without, but even also within myself; and all
plenty which is not my God is poverty to me. <span
id="fr_1193"></span>[1194](#fn_1193)

<span id="vi.XIII.VIII-p3"></span> We may note here that Augustin
maintains the existence of the relationship between these two events. He
says in his *Enchiridion*, c. xxix., that “the restored part of humanity
will fill up the gap which the rebellion and fall of the devils had left
in the company of the angels. For this is the promise to the saints,
that at the resurrection they shall be equal to the angels of God ([Luke
20.36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036)<span
id="vi.XIII.VIII-p3.1"></span>). And thus the Jerusalem which is above,
which is the mother of us all, the City of God, shall not be spoiled of
any of the number of her citizens, shall perhaps reign over even a more
abundant population.” He speaks to the same effect at the close of ch. 1
of his *De Civ. Dei*, xxii. This doctrine was enlarged upon by some of
the writers of the seventeenth century.

<span id="vi.XIII.VIII-p4"></span> See his *De Civ. Dei*, xxii. 1, where
he beautifully compares sin to blindness, in that it makes us miserable
in depriving us of the sight of God. Also his *De Cat. Rud.* sec. 24,
where he shows that the restlessness and changefulness of the world
cannot give rest. Comp. p. 46, note 7, above.

<span id="vi.XIII.VIII-p8"></span> [Ps.
31.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020)<span
id="vi.XIII.VIII-p8.1"></span>. “In abscondito vultus tui,” *Old Ver*.
Augustin in his comment on this passage (*Enarr.* 4, sec. 8) gives us
his interpretation. He points out that the refuge of a particular place
(*e.g.* the bosom of Abraham) is not enough. We must have God with us
here as our refuge, and then we will be hidden in His countenance
hereafter; or in other words, if we receive Him into our heart now, He
will hereafter receive us into His countenance—*Ille post hoc seculum
excipiet te vultu suo*. For heaven is a prepared place for a prepared
people, and we must be fitted to live with Him there by going to Him
now, and this, to quote from his *De Serm. Dom. in Mon.* i. 27, “not
with a slow movement of the body, but with the swift impulse of love.”
