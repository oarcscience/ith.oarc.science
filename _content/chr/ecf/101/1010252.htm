<p class="c10"><a name="vi.XII.XIX-p2"></A>28. For it is true, O Lord, that Thou hast made heaven and earth; it is also true, that the Beginning is Thy Wisdom, in Which Thou hast made all things.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1136"></A><A HREF="#fn_1136"><FONT SIZE="1">1137</FONT></A>
 It is likewise true, that this visible world hath its own great parts, the heaven and the earth, which in a short compass comprehends all made and created natures. It is also true, that everything mutable sets before our minds a certain want of form, whereof it taketh a form, or is changed and turned. It is true, that that is subject to no times which so cleaveth to the changeless form as that, though it be mutable, it is not changed. It is true, that the formlessness, which is almost nothing, cannot have changes, of times. It is true, that that of which anything is made may by a certain mode of speech be called by the name of that thing which is made of it; whence that formlessness of which heaven and earth were made might it be called &#8220;heaven and earth.&#8221; It is true, that of all things having form, nothing is nearer to the formless than the earth and the deep. It is true, that not only every created, and formed thing, but also whatever is capable of creation and of form, Thou hast made, &#8220;by whom are all things.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1137"></A><A HREF="#fn_1137"><FONT SIZE="1">1138</FONT></A>
 It is true, that everything that is formed from that which is formless was formless before it was formed.</p>
