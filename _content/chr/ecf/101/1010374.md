<span id="vii.1.LXVIII"></span>

<span id="vii.1.LXVIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.LXVIII-p1.1"></span>Letter LXVIII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXVIII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXVIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 402.)

<span id="vii.1.LXVIII-p3"></span>*<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXVIII-p3.1"></span>To Augustin, My Lord, Truly Holy and Most
Blessed Father,</span>* <span id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877) <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.1.LXVIII-p4.1"></span>*Jerome Sends Greeting in
Christ.*</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXVIII-p5"></span>1. When my kinsman, our holy son
Asterius, subdeacon, was just on the point of beginning his journey, the
letter of your Grace arrived, in which you clear yourself of the charge
of having sent to Rome a book written against your humble servant. <span
id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878) I had not heard that charge; but by
our brother Sysinnius, deacon, copies of a letter addressed by some one
apparently to me have come hither. In the said letter I am exhorted to
sing the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.1.LXVIII-p6.1"></span>παλινωδία</span>, confessing mistake in
regard to a paragraph of the apostle’s writing, and to imitate
Stesichorus, who, vacillating between disparagement and praises of
Helen, recovered, by praising her, the eyesight which he had forfeited
by speaking against her. <span id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879)
Although the style and the method of argument appeared to be yours, I
must frankly confess to your Excellency that I did not think it right to
assume without examination the authenticity of a letter of which I had
only seen copies, lest perchance, if offended by my reply, you should
with justice complain that it was my duty first to have made sure that
you were the author, and only after that was ascertained, to address you
in reply. Another reason for my delay was the protracted illness of the
pious and venerable Paula. For, while occupied long in attending upon
her in severe illness, I had almost forgotten your letter, or more
correctly, the letter written in your name, remembering the verse, “Like
music in the day of mourning is an unseasonable discourse.” <span
id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880) Therefore, if it is your letter,
write me frankly that it is so, or send me a more accurate copy, in
order that without any passionate rancour we may devote ourselves to
discuss scriptural truth; and I may either correct my own mistake, or
show that another has without good reason found fault with me.

<span id="vii.1.LXVIII-p9"></span>2. Far be it from me to presume to
attack anything which your Grace has written. For it is enough for me to
prove my own views without controverting what others hold. But it is
well known to one of your wisdom, that every one is satisfied with his
own opinion, and that it is puerile self-sufficiency to seek, as young
men have of old been wont to do, to gain glory to one’s own name by
assailing men who have become renowned. I am not so foolish as to think
myself insulted by the fact that you give an explanation different from
mine; since you, on the <span id="page_325">p. 325</span> <span
id="vii.1.LXVIII-Page_325"></span>other hand, are not wronged by my
views being contrary to those which you maintain. But that is the kind
of reproof by which friends may truly benefit each other, when each, not
seeing his own bag of faults, observes, as Persius has it, the wallet
borne by the other. <span id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881) Let me
say further, love one who loves you, and do not because you are young
challenge a veteran in the field of Scripture. I have had my time, and
have run my course to the utmost of my strength. It is but fair that I
should rest, while you in your turn run and accomplish great distances;
at the same time (with your leave, and without intending any
disrespect), lest it should seem that to quote from the poets is a thing
which you alone can do, let me remind you of the encounter between Dares
and Entellus, <span id="fr_1882"></span>[1883](#fn_1882) and of the
proverb, “The tired ox treads with a firmer step.” With sorrow I have
dictated these words. Would that I could receive your embrace, and that
by converse we might aid each other in learning!

<span id="vii.1.LXVIII-p12"></span>3. With his usual effrontery,
Calphurnius, surnamed Lanarius, <span
id="fr_1883"></span>[1884](#fn_1883) has sent me his execrable writings,
which I understand that he has been at pains to disseminate in Africa
also. To these I have replied in past, and shortly; and I have sent you
a copy of my treatise, intending by the first opportunity to send you a
larger work, when I have leisure to prepare it. In this treatise I have
been careful not to offend Christian feeling in any, but only to confute
the lies and hallucinations arising from his ignorance and madness.

<span id="vii.1.LXVIII-p14"></span>Remember me, holy and venerable
father. See how sincerely I love thee, in that I am unwilling, even when
challenged, to reply, and refuse to believe you to be the author of that
which in another I would sharply rebuke. Our brother Communis sends his
respectful salutation.
