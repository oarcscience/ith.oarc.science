id="vi.X.XVIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—A Thing When Lost Could Not
Be Found Unless It Were Retained in the Memory.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XVIII-p2"></span>27. For the woman who lost her drachma,
and searched for it with a lamp, <span id="fr_853"></span>[854](#fn_853)
unless she had remembered it, would never have found it. For when it was
found, whence could she know whether it were the same, had she not
remembered it? I remember to have lost and found many things; and this I
know thereby, that when I was searching for any of them, and was asked,
“Is this it?” “Is that it?” I answered “No,” until such time as that
which I sought were offered to me. Which had I not remembered,—whatever
it were,—though it were offered me, yet would I not find it, because I
could not recognise it. And thus it is always, when we search for and
find anything that is lost. Notwithstanding, if anything be by accident
lost from the sight, not from the memory,—as any visible body,—the image
of it is retained within, and is searched for until it be restored to
sight; and when it is found, it is recognised by <span id="page_150">p.
150</span> <span id="vi.X.XVIII-Page_150"></span>the image which is
within. Nor do we say that we have found what we had lost unless we
recognise it; nor can we recognise it unless we remember it. But this,
though lost to the sight, was retained in the memory.
