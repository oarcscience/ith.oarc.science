id="vi.III.X-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—He Reproves the Triflings of the
Manichæans as to the Fruits of the Earth.</span>

<span id="vi.III.X-p2"></span>18. These things being ignorant of, I
derided those holy servants and prophets of Thine. And what did I gain
by deriding them but to be derided by Thee, being insensibly, and little
by little, led on to those follies, as to credit that a fig-tree wept
when it was plucked, and that the mother-tree shed milky tears? Which
fig notwithstanding, plucked not by his own but another’s wickedness,
had some “saint” <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257) eaten and
mingled with his entrails, he should breathe out of it angels; yea, in
his prayers he shall assuredly groan and sigh forth particles of God,
which particles of the most high and true God should have remained bound
in that fig unless they had been set free by the teeth and belly of some
“elect saint”! <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258) And I, miserable
one, believed that more mercy was to be shown to the fruits of the earth
than unto men, for whom they were created; for if a hungry man—who was
not a Manichæan—should beg for any, that morsel which should be given
him would appear, as it were, condemned to capital punishment. <span

<span id="vi.III.X-p3"></span> *i.e.* Manichæan saint.

<span id="vi.III.X-p4"></span> According to this extraordinary system,
it was the privilege of the “elect” to set free in eating such parts of
the divine substance as were imprisoned in the vegetable creation (*Con.
Faust*. xxxi. 5). They did not marry or work in the fields, and led an
ascetic life, the “hearers” or catechumens being privileged to provide
them with food. The “elect” passed immediately on dying into the realm
of light, while, as a reward for their service, the souls of the
“hearers” after death transmigrated into plants (from which they might
be most readily freed), or into the “elect,” so as, in their turn, to
pass away into the realm of light. See *Con. Faust*. v. 10, xx. 23; and
*in Ps.* cxl.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[66:260](1010056.htm#fr_259) <span
id="vi.III.X-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vi.III.X-p5"></span> Augustin frequently alludes to their
conduct to the poor, in refusing to give them bread or the fruits of the
earth, lest in eating they should defile the portion of God contained
therein. But to avoid the odium of their conduct, they would
inconsequently give money whereby food might be bought. See *in Ps.*
cxl. sec. 12; and *De Mor. Manich.* 36, 37, and 53.
