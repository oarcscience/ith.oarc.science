id="vi.XIII.III-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Genesis I. 3,—Of “Light,”—He
Understands as It is Seen in the Spiritual Creature.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.III-p2"></span>4. But what Thou saidst in the
beginning of the creation, “Let there be light, and there was
light,” <span id="fr_1175"></span>[1176](#fn_1175) I do not unfitly
understand of the spiritual creature; because there was even then a kind
of life, which Thou mightest illuminate. But as it had not deserved of
Thee that it should be such a life as could be enlightened, so neither,
when it already was, hath it deserved of Thee that it should be
enlightened. For neither could its formlessness be pleasing unto Thee,
unless it became light,—not by merely existing, but by beholding the
illuminating light, and cleaving unto it; so also, that it lives, and
lives happily, <span id="fr_1176"></span>[1177](#fn_1176) it owes to
nothing whatsoever but to Thy grace; being converted by means of a
better change unto that which can be changed neither into better nor
into worse; the which Thou only art because Thou only simply art, to
whom it is not one thing to live, another to live blessedly, since Thou
art Thyself Thine own Blessedness.
