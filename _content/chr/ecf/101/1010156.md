<span id="vi.IX.XIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.IX.XIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—He Entreats God for Her Sins,
and Admonishes His Readers to Remember Her Piously.</span>

<span id="vi.IX.XIII-p2"></span>34. But,—my heart being now healed of
that wound, in so far as it could be convicted of a carnal <span
id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789) affection,—I pour out unto Thee, O our
God, on behalf of that Thine handmaid, tears of a far different sort,
even that which flows from a spirit broken by the thoughts of the
dangers of every soul that dieth in Adam. And although she, having been
“made alive” in Christ <span id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790) even
before she was freed from the flesh had so lived as to praise Thy name
both by her faith and conversation, yet dare I not say <span
id="fr_791"></span>[792](#fn_791) that from the time Thou didst
regenerate her by baptism, no word went forth from her mouth against Thy
precepts. <span id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792) And it hath been
declared by Thy Son, the Truth, that “Whosoever shall say to his
brother, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.” <span
id="fr_793"></span>[794](#fn_793) And woe even unto the praiseworthy
life of man, if, putting away mercy, Thou shouldest investigate it. But
because Thou dost not narrowly inquire after sins, we hope with
confidence to find some place of indulgence with Thee. But whosoever
recounts his true merits <span id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794) to
Thee, what is it that he recounts to Thee but Thine own gifts? Oh, if
men would know themselves to be men; and that “he that glorieth” would
“glory in the Lord!” <span id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795)

<span id="vi.IX.XIII-p10"></span>35. I then, O my Praise and my Life,
Thou God of my heart, putting aside for a little her good deeds, for
which I joyfully give thanks to Thee, do now beseech Thee for the sins
of my mother. Hearken unto me, through that Medicine of our wounds who
hung upon the tree, and who, sitting at Thy right hand, “maketh
intercession for us.” <span id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796) I know
that she acted mercifully, and from the heart <span
id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797) forgave her debtors their debts; do
Thou also forgive her debts, <span id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798)
whatever she contracted during so many <span id="page_141">p. 141</span>
<span id="vi.IX.XIII-Page_141"></span>years since the water of
salvation. Forgive her, O Lord, forgive her, I beseech Thee; “enter not
into judgment” with her. <span id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799) Let Thy
mercy be exalted above Thy justice, <span
id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800) because Thy words are true, and Thou
hast promised mercy unto “the merciful;” <span
id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801) which Thou gavest them to be who wilt
“have mercy” on whom Thou wilt “have mercy,” and wilt “have compassion”
on whom Thou hast had compassion. <span
id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802)

<span id="vi.IX.XIII-p18"></span>36. And I believe Thou hast already
done that which I ask Thee; but “accept the free-will offerings of my
mouth, O Lord.” <span id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803) For she, when
the day of her dissolution was near at hand, took no thought to have her
body sumptuously covered, or embalmed with spices; nor did she covet a
choice monument, or desire her paternal burial-place. These things she
entrusted not to us, but only desired to have her name remembered at Thy
altar, which she had served without the omission of a single day; <span
id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804) whence she knew that the holy
sacrifice was dispensed, by which the handwriting that was against us is
blotted out; <span id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805) by which the enemy
was triumphed over, <span id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806) who, summing
up our offences, and searching for something to bring against us, found
nothing in Him <span id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807) in whom we
conquer. Who will restore to Him the innocent blood? Who will repay Him
the price with which He bought us, so as to take us from Him? Unto the
sacrament of which our ransom did Thy handmaid bind her soul by the bond
of faith. Let none separate her from Thy protection. Let not the “lion”
and the “dragon” <span id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808) introduce
himself by force or fraud. For she will not reply that she owes nothing,
lest she be convicted and got the better of by the wily deceiver; but
she will answer that her “sins are forgiven” <span
id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809) by Him to whom no one is able to repay
that price which He, owing nothing, laid down for us.

<span id="vi.IX.XIII-p26"></span>37. May she therefore rest in peace
with her husband, before or after whom she married none; whom she
obeyed, with patience bringing forth fruit <span
id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810) unto Thee, that she might gain him
also for Thee. And inspire, O my Lord my God, inspire Thy servants my
brethren, Thy sons my masters, who with voice and heart and writings I
serve, that so many of them as shall read these confessions may at Thy
altar remember Monica, Thy handmaid, together with Patricius, her
sometime husband, by whose flesh Thou introducedst me into this life, in
what manner I know not. May they with pious affection be mindful of my
parents in this transitory light, of my brethren that are under Thee our
Father in our Catholic mother, and of my fellow-citizens in the eternal
Jerusalem, which the wandering of Thy people sigheth for from their
departure until their return. That so my mother’s last entreaty to me
may, through my confessions more than through my prayers, be more
abundantly fulfilled to her through the prayers of many. <span

<span id="vi.IX.XIII-p4"></span> [1 Cor.
15.22](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#022)<span
id="vi.IX.XIII-p4.1"></span>. The universalists of every age have
interpreted the word “all” here so as to make salvation by Christ Jesus
extend to every child of Adam. If their interpretation were true,
Monica’s spirit need not have been troubled at the thought of the danger
of unregenerate souls. But Augustin in his *De Civ. Dei*, xiii. 23,
gives the import of the word: “Not that all who die in Adam shall be
members of Christ—for the great majority shall be punished in eternal
death,—but he uses the word ‘all’ in both clauses because, as no one
dies in an animal body except in Adam, *so no one is quickened a
spiritual body save in Christ.*” See x. sec. 68, note 1, below.

<span id="fn_791"></span>[140:792](1010156.htm#fr_791) <span
id="vi.IX.XIII-p4.2"></span>

<span id="vi.IX.XIII-p5"></span> For to have done so would have been to
go perilously near to the heresy of the Pelagians, who laid claim to the
possibility of attaining perfection in this life by the power of
free-will, and without the assistance of divine grace; and went even so
far, he tells us (*Ep.* clxxvi. 2), as to say that those who had so
attained need not utter the petition for forgiveness in the Lord’s
Prayer,—*ut ei non sit jam necessarium dicere “Dimitte nobis debita
nostra.”* Those in our own day who enunciate perfectionist theories,—
though, it is true, not denying the grace of God as did these,—may well
ponder Augustin’s forcible words in his *De Pecc. Mer. et Rem.* iii. 13:
“Optandum est ut fiat, conandum est ut fiat, supplicandum est ut fiat;
non tamen quasi factum fuerit, confitendum.” We are indeed commanded to
be perfect ([Matt. 5.48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048)<span
id="vi.IX.XIII-p5.1"></span>); and the philosophy underlying the command
is embalmed in the words of the proverb, “Aim high, and you will strike
high.” But he who lives nearest to God will have the humility of heart
which will make him ready to confess that in His sight he is a
“miserable sinner.” Some interesting remarks on this subject will be
found in Augustin’s *De Civ. Dei*, xiv. 9, on the text, “If we say we
have no sin,” etc. ([1 John 1.8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008)<span
id="vi.IX.XIII-p5.2"></span>.) On sins after baptism, see note on next
section.

<span id="vi.IX.XIII-p8"></span> There is a passage parallel to this in
his *Ep.* to Sextus (cxciv. 19). “Merits” therefore would appear to be
used simply in the sense of good actions. Compare sec. 17, above, xiii.
sec. 1, below, and *Ep.* cv. That righteousness is not by merit, appears
from *Ep.* cxciv.; *Ep.* clxxvii., to Innocent; and *Serm.*ccxciii.

<span id="vi.IX.XIII-p13"></span> [Matt.
6.12](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012)<span
id="vi.IX.XIII-p13.1"></span>. Augustin here as elsewhere applies this
petition in the Lord’s Prayer to the forgiveness of *sins after
baptism*. He does so constantly. For example, in his *Ep.* cclxv. he
says: “We do not ask for those to be forgiven which we doubt not were
forgiven in baptism; but those which, though small, are frequent, and
spring from the frailty of human nature.” Again, in his *Con Ep.
Parmen.* ii. 10, after using almost the same words, he points out that
it is a prayer against *daily* sins; and in his *De Civ. Dei*, xxi. 27,
where he examines the passage in relation to various erroneous beliefs,
he says it “was a *daily* prayer He \[Christ\] was teaching, and it was
certainly to disciples already justified He was speaking. What, then,
does He mean by ‘your sins’ ([Matt. vi.
14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014)<span
id="vi.IX.XIII-p13.2"></span>), but those sins from which not even you
*who are justified and sanctified can be free?*” See note on the
previous section; and also for the feeling in the early Church as to
sins after baptism, the note on i. sec. 17, above.

<span id="vi.IX.XIII-p28"></span> The origin of prayers for the dead
dates back probably to the close of the second century. In note 1, p.
90, we have quoted from Tertullian’s *De Corona Militis*, where he says
“Oblationes pro defunctis pro natalitiis annua die facimus.” In his *De
Monogamia*, he speaks of a widow praying for her departed husband, that
“he might have rest, and be a partaker in the first resurrection.” From
this time a *catena* of quotations from the Fathers might be given, if
space permitted, showing how, beginning with early expressions of *hope*
for the dead, there, in process of time, arose *prayers* even for the
unregenerate, until at last there was developed purgatory on the one
side, and creature-worship on the other. That Augustin did not entertain
the idea of creature-worship will be seen from his *Ep.* to Maximus,
xvii. 5. In his *De Dulcit. Quæst.* 2 (where he discusses the whole
question), he concludes that prayer must not be made for all, because
all have not led the same life in the flesh. Still, in his *Enarr. in
Ps.* cviii. 17, he argues from the case of the rich man in the parable,
that the departed do certainly “have a care for us.” Aërius, towards the
close of the fourth century, objected to prayers for the dead, chiefly
on the ground (see Usher’s *Answer to a Jesuit*, iii. 258) of their
uselessness. In the Church of England, as will be seen by reference to
Keeling’s *Liturgicæ Britannicæ*, pp. 210, 335, 339, and 341, prayers
for the dead were eliminated from the second Prayer Book; and to the
prudence of this step Palmer bears testimony in his *Origines
Liturgicæ*, iv. 10, justifying it on the ground that the retaining of
these prayers implied a belief in her holding the doctrine of purgatory.
Reference may be made to Epiphanius, *Adv. Hær.* 75; Bishop Bull,
*Sermon* 3; and Bingham, xv. 3, secs. 15, 16, and xxiii. 3, sec. 13.
