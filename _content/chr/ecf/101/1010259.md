id="vi.XII.XXVI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—What He Might Have Asked of
God Had He Been Enjoined to Write the Book of Genesis.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.XXVI-p2"></span>36. And yet, O my God, Thou exaltation
of my humility, and rest of my labour, who hearest my confessions, and
forgivest my sins, since Thou commandest me that I should love my
neighbour as myself, I cannot believe that Thou gavest to Moses, Thy
most faithful servant, a less gift than I should wish and desire for
myself from Thee, had I been born in his time, and hadst Thou placed me
in that position that through the service of my heart and of my tongue
those books might be distributed, which so long after were to profit all
nations, and through the whole world, from so great a pinnacle of
authority, were to surmount the words of all false and proud teachings.
I should have wished truly had I then been Moses (for we all come from
the same mass; and what is man, saving that Thou art mindful of
him? <span id="fr_1153"></span>[1154](#fn_1153) ). I should then, had I
been at that time what he was, and enjoined by Thee to write the book of
Genesis, have wished that such a power of expression and such a method
of arrangement should be given me, that they who cannot as yet
understand how God creates might not reject the words as surpassing
their powers; and they who are already able to do this, would find, in
what true opinion soever they had by thought arrived at, that it was not
passed over in the few words of Thy servant; and should another man by
the light of truth have discovered another, neither should that fail to
be found in those same words.
