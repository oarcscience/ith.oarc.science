<span id="vi.XIII.IX-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XIII.IX-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Why the Holy Spirit Was Only
“Borne Over” The Waters.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.IX-p2"></span>10. But was not either the Father or the
Son “borne over the waters?” If we understand this to mean in space, as
a body, then neither was the Holy Spirit; but if the incommutable
super-eminence of Divinity above everything mutable, then both Father,
and Son, and Holy <span id="page_193">p. 193</span> <span
id="vi.XIII.IX-Page_193"></span>Ghost were borne “over the waters.” Why,
then, is this said of Thy Spirit only? Why is it said of Him alone? As
if He had been in place who is not in place, of whom only it is written,
that He is Thy gift? <span id="fr_1194"></span>[1195](#fn_1194) In Thy
gift we rest; there we enjoy Thee. Our rest is our place. Love lifts us
up thither, and Thy good Spirit lifteth our lowliness from the gates of
death. <span id="fr_1195"></span>[1196](#fn_1195) In Thy good pleasure
lies our peace. <span id="fr_1196"></span>[1197](#fn_1196) The body by
its own weight gravitates towards its own place. Weight goes not
downward only, but to its own place. Fire tends upwards, a stone
downwards. They are propelled by their own weights, they seek their own
places. Oil poured under the water is raised above the water; water
poured upon oil sinks under the oil. They are propelled by their own
weights, they seek their own places. Out of order, they are restless;
restored to order, they are at rest. My weight is my love; <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[1198](#fn_1197) by it am I borne whithersoever I am
borne. By Thy Gift we are inflamed, and are borne upwards; we wax hot
inwardly, and go forwards. We ascend Thy ways that be in our
heart, <span id="fr_1198"></span>[1199](#fn_1198) and sing a song of
degrees; we glow inwardly with Thy fire, with Thy good fire, and we go,
because we go upwards to the peace of Jerusalem; for glad was I when
they said unto me, “Let us go into the house of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1199"></span>[1200](#fn_1199) There hath Thy good pleasure placed
us, that we may desire no other thing than to dwell there for ever.
