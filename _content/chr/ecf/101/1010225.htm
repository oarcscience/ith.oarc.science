<p class="c10"><a name="vi.XI.XXIV-p2"></A>31. Dost Thou command that I should assent, if any one should say that time is &#8220;the motion of a body?&#8221; Thou dost not command me. For I hear that no body is moved but in time. This Thou sayest; but that the very motion of a body is time, I hear not; Thou sayest it not. For when a body is moved, I by time measure how long it may be moving from the time in which it began to be moved till it left off. And if I saw not whence it began, and it continued to be moved, so that I see not when it leaves off, I cannot measure unless, perchance, from the time I began until I cease to see. But if I look long, I only proclaim that the time is long, but not how long it may be because when we say, &#8220;How long,&#8221; we speak by comparison, as, &#8220;This is as long as that,&#8221; or, &#8220;This is double as long as that,&#8221; or any other thing of the kind. But if we were able to note down the distances of places whence and whither cometh the body <A NAME="page_172"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 172</FONT></A> <a name="vi.XI.XXIV-Page_172"></A>which is moved, or its parts, if it moved as in a wheel, we can say in how much time the motion of the body or its part, from this place unto that, was performed. Since, then, the motion of a body is one thing, that by which we measure how long it is another, who cannot see which of these is rather to be called time? For, although a body be sometimes moved, sometimes stand still, we measure not its motion only, but also its standing still, by time; and we say, &#8220;It stood still as much as it moved;&#8221; or, &#8220;It stood still twice or thrice as long as it moved;&#8221; and if any other space which our measuring hath either determined or imagined, more or less, as we are accustomed to say. Time, therefore, is not the motion of a body.</p>
