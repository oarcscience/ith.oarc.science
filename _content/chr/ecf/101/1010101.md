<span id="vi.VI.X-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.VI.X-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—The Wonderful Integrity of Alypius
in Judgment. The Lasting Friendship of Nebridius with Augustin.</span>

<span id="vi.VI.X-p2"></span>16. Him, therefore, had I lighted upon at
Rome, and he clung to me by a most strong tie, and accompanied me to
Milan, both that he might not leave me, and that he might practise
something of the law he had studied, more with a view of pleasing his
parents than himself. There had he thrice sat as assessor with an
uncorruptness wondered at by others, he rather wondering at those who
could prefer gold to integrity. His character was tested, also, not only
by the bait of covetousness, but by the spur of fear. At Rome, he was
assessor to the Count of the Italian Treasury. <span
id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461) There was at that time a most potent
senator, to whose favours many were indebted, of whom also many stood in
fear. He would fain, by his usual power, have a thing granted him which
was forbidden by the laws. This Alypius resisted; a bribe was promised,
he scorned it with all his heart; threats were employed, he trampled
them under foot,—all men being astonished at so rare a spirit, which
neither coveted the friendship nor feared the enmity of a man at once so
powerful and so greatly famed for his innumerable means of doing good or
ill. Even the judge whose councillor Alypius was, although also
unwilling that it should be done, yet did not openly refuse it, but put
the matter off upon Alypius, alleging that it was he who would not
permit him to do it; for verily, had the judge done it, Alypius would
have decided otherwise. With this one thing in the way of learning was
he very nearly led away,—that he might have books copied for him at
prætorian prices. <span id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462) But,
consulting justice, he changed his mind for the better, esteeming
equity, whereby he was hindered, more gainful than the power whereby he
was permitted. These are little things, but “He that is faithful in that
which is least, is faithful also in much.” <span
id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463) Nor can that possibly be void which
proceedeth out of the mouth of Thy Truth. “If, therefore, ye have not
been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust
the true riches? And if ye have not been faithful in that which is
another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own?” <span
id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464) He, being such, did at that time cling
to me, and wavered in purpose, as I did, what course of life was to be
taken.

<span id="vi.VI.X-p7"></span>17. Nebridius also, who had left his native
country near Carthage, and Carthage itself, where he had usually lived,
leaving behind his fine paternal estate, his house, and his mother, who
intended not to follow him, had come to Milan, for no other reason than
that he might live with me in a most ardent search after truth and
wisdom. Like me he sighed, like me he wavered, an ardent seeker after
true life, and a most acute examiner of the most abstruse
questions. <span id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465) So were there three
begging mouths, sighing out their wants one to the other, and waiting
upon Thee, that Thou mightest give them their meat in due season. <span
id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466) And in all the bitterness which by Thy
mercy followed our worldly pursuits, as we contemplated the end, why
this suffering should be ours, darkness came upon us; and we turned away
groaning and exclaiming, “How long shall these things be?” And this we
often said; and saying so, we did not relinquish them, for as yet we had
discovered noth<span id="page_98">p. 98</span> <span
id="vi.VI.X-Page_98"></span>ing certain to which, when relinquished, we
might betake ourselves.

<span id="vi.VI.X-p3"></span> “The Lord High Treasurer of the Western
Empire was called *Comes Sacrarum largitionum*. He had six other
treasurers in so many provinces under him, whereof he of Italy was one
under whom this Alypius had some office of judicature, something like
(though far inferior) to our Baron of the Exchequer. See Sir Henry
Spelman’s *Glossary*, in the word *Comes*; and Cassiodor, Var. v. c.
40.”—W. W.

<span id="vi.VI.X-p4"></span> *Pretiis prætorianis*. Du Cange says that
“*Pretium regium* is the right of a king or lord to purchase commodities
at a certain and definite price.” This may perhaps help us to understand
the phrase as above employed.
