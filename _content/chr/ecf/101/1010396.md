<span id="vii.1.XC-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.XC-p1.1"></span>Letter XC.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XC-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XC-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 408.)

<span id="vii.1.XC-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XC-p3.1"></span>To My Noble Lord and Brother, Worthy of All
Esteem, Bishop Augustin, Nectarius Sends Greeting.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XC-p4"></span>I do not dwell upon the strength of the
love men bear to their native land, for you know it. It is the only
emotion which has a stronger claim than love of kindred. If there were
any limit or time beyond which it would be lawful for right-hearted men
to withdraw themselves from its control, I have by this time well earned
exemption from the burdens which it imposes. But since love and
gratitude towards our country gain strength every day, and the nearer
one comes to the end of life, the more ardent is his desire to leave his
country in a safe and prosperous condition, I rejoice, in beginning this
letter, that I am addressing myself to a man who is versed in all kinds
of learning, and therefore able to enter into my feelings.

<span id="vii.1.XC-p5"></span>There are many things in the colony of
Calama which justly bind my love to it. I was born here, and I have (in
the opinion of others) rendered great services to this community. Now,
my lord most excellent and worthy of all esteem, this town has fallen
disastrously by a grievous misdemeanour on the part of her
citizens, <span id="fr_2119"></span>[2120](#fn_2119) which must be
punished with very great severity, if we are dealt with according to the
rigour of the civil law. But a bishop is guided by another law. His duty
is to promote the welfare of men, to interest himself in any case only
with a view to the benefit of the parties, and to obtain for other men
the pardon of their sins at the hand of the Almighty God. Wherefore I
beseech you with all possible urgency to secure that, if the matter is
to be made the subject of a prosecution, the guiltless be protected, and
a distinction drawn between the innocent and those who did the wrong.
This, which, as you see, is a demand in accordance with your own natural
sentiments, I pray you to grant. An assessment to compensate for the
losses caused by the tumult can be easily levied. We only deprecate the
severity of revenge. May you live in the more full enjoyment of the
Divine favour, my noble lord, and brother worthy of all esteem.
