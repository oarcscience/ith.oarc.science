<p class="c41"><a name="vii.1.LXVIII-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="vii.1.LXVIII-p1.1"></A>Letter LXVIII.</span></p>  
<p class="c1"><a name="vii.1.LXVIII-p2"></A>(<span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.LXVIII-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span> 402.)</p>  
<p class="c58"><a name="vii.1.LXVIII-p3"></A><i><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.LXVIII-p3.1"></A>To Augustin, My Lord, Truly Holy and Most Blessed Father,</span></i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1877"></A><A HREF="#fn_1877"><FONT SIZE="1">1878</FONT></A>
 <span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.LXVIII-p4.1"></A><i>Jerome Sends Greeting in Christ.</i></span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.LXVIII-p5"></A>1. When my kinsman, our holy son Asterius, subdeacon, was just on the point of beginning his journey, the letter of your Grace arrived, in which you clear yourself of the charge of having sent to Rome a book written against your humble servant.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1878"></A><A HREF="#fn_1878"><FONT SIZE="1">1879</FONT></A>
 I had not heard that charge; but by our brother Sysinnius, deacon, copies of a letter addressed by some one apparently to me have come hither. In the said letter I am exhorted to sing the <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.1.LXVIII-p6.1"></A>&#960;&#945;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#948;&#8055;&#945;</span>, confessing mistake in regard to a paragraph of the apostle&#146;s writing, and to imitate Stesichorus, who, vacillating between disparagement and praises of Helen, recovered, by praising her, the eyesight which he had forfeited by speaking against her.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1879"></A><A HREF="#fn_1879"><FONT SIZE="1">1880</FONT></A>
 Although the style and the method of argument appeared to be yours, I must frankly confess to your Excellency that I did not think it right to assume without examination the authenticity of a letter of which I had only seen copies, lest perchance, if offended by my reply, you should with justice complain that it was my duty first to have made sure that you were the author, and only after that was ascertained, to address you in reply. Another reason for my delay was the protracted illness of the pious and venerable Paula. For, while occupied long in attending upon her in severe illness, I had almost forgotten your letter, or more correctly, the letter written in your name, remembering the verse, &#8220;Like music in the day of mourning is an unseasonable discourse.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1880"></A><A HREF="#fn_1880"><FONT SIZE="1">1881</FONT></A>
 Therefore, if it is your letter, write me frankly that it is so, or send me a more accurate copy, in order that without any passionate rancour we may devote ourselves to discuss scriptural truth; and I may either correct my own mistake, or show that another has without good reason found fault with me.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.LXVIII-p9"></A>2. Far be it from me to presume to attack anything which your Grace has written. For it is enough for me to prove my own views without controverting what others hold. But it is well known to one of your wisdom, that every one is satisfied with his own opinion, and that it is puerile self-sufficiency to seek, as young men have of old been wont to do, to gain glory to one&#146;s own name by assailing men who have become renowned. I am not so foolish as to think myself insulted by the fact that you give an explanation different from mine; since you, on the <A NAME="page_325"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 325</FONT></A> <a name="vii.1.LXVIII-Page_325"></A>other hand, are not wronged by my views being contrary to those which you maintain. But that is the kind of reproof by which friends may truly benefit each other, when each, not seeing his own bag of faults, observes, as Persius has it, the wallet borne by the other.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1881"></A><A HREF="#fn_1881"><FONT SIZE="1">1882</FONT></A>
 Let me say further, love one who loves you, and do not because you are young challenge a veteran in the field of Scripture. I have had my time, and have run my course to the utmost of my strength. It is but fair that I should rest, while you in your turn run and accomplish great distances; at the same time (with your leave, and without intending any disrespect), lest it should seem that to quote from the poets is a thing which you alone can do, let me remind you of the encounter between Dares and Entellus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1882"></A><A HREF="#fn_1882"><FONT SIZE="1">1883</FONT></A>
 and of the proverb, &#8220;The tired ox treads with a firmer step.&#8221; With sorrow I have dictated these words. Would that I could receive your embrace, and that by converse we might aid each other in learning!</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.LXVIII-p12"></A>3. With his usual effrontery, Calphurnius, surnamed Lanarius,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1883"></A><A HREF="#fn_1883"><FONT SIZE="1">1884</FONT></A>
 has sent me his execrable writings, which I understand that he has been at pains to disseminate in Africa also. To these I have replied in past, and shortly; and I have sent you a copy of my treatise, intending by the first opportunity to send you a larger work, when I have leisure to prepare it. In this treatise I have been careful not to offend Christian feeling in any, but only to confute the lies and hallucinations arising from his ignorance and madness.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.LXVIII-p14"></A>Remember me, holy and venerable father. See how sincerely I love thee, in that I am unwilling, even when challenged, to reply, and refuse to believe you to be the author of that which in another I would sharply rebuke. Our brother Communis sends his respectful salutation.</p>
