id="vi.I_1.VII-p2.1"></span>Chapter VII.—He Shows by Example that Even
Infancy is Prone to Sin.</span>

<span id="vi.I_1.VII-p3"></span>11. Hearken, O God! Alas for the sins of
men! Man saith this, and Thou dost compassionate him; for Thou didst
create him, but didst not create the sin that is in him. Who bringeth to
my remembrance the sin of my infancy? For before Thee none is free from
sin, not even the infant which has lived but a day upon the earth. Who
bringeth this to my remembrance? Doth not each little one, in whom I
behold that which I do not remember of myself? In what, then, did I sin?
Is it that I cried for the breast? If I should now so cry,—not indeed
for the breast, but for the food suitable to my years,—I should be most
justly laughed at and rebuked. What I then did deserved rebuke; but as I
could not understand those who rebuked me, neither custom nor reason
suffered me to be rebuked. For as we grow we root out and cast from us
such habits. I have not seen any one who is wise, when “purging” <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154) anything cast away the good. Or was it
good, even for a time, to strive to get by crying that which, if given,
would be hurtful—to be bitterly indignant that those who were free and
its elders, and those to whom it owed its being, besides many others
wiser than it, who would not give way to the nod of its good pleasure,
were not subject unto it—to endeavour to harm, by struggling as much as
it could, because those commands were not obeyed which only could have
been obeyed to its hurt? Then, in the weakness of the infant’s limbs,
and not in its will, lies its innocency. I myself have seen and known an
infant to be jealous though it could not speak. It became pale, and cast
bitter looks on its foster-brother. Who is ignorant of this? Mothers and
nurses tell us that they appease these things by I know not what
remedies; and may this be taken for innocence, that when the fountain of
milk is flowing fresh and abundant, one who has need should not be
allowed to share it, though needing that nourishment to sustain life?
Yet we look leniently on these things, not because they are not faults,
nor because the faults are small, but because they will vanish as age
increases. For although you may allow these things now, you could not
bear them with equanimity if found in an older person.

<span id="vi.I_1.VII-p5"></span>12. Thou, therefore, O Lord my God, who
gavest life to the infant, and a frame which, as we see, Thou hast
endowed with senses, compacted with limbs, beautified with form, and,
for its general good and safety, hast introduced all vital energies—Thou
commandest me to praise Thee for these things, “to give thanks unto the
Lord, and to sing praise unto Thy name, O Most High;” <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155) for Thou art a God omnipotent and
good, though Thou hadst done nought but these things, which none other
can do but Thou, who alone madest all things, O Thou most fair, who
madest all things fair, and orderest all according to Thy law. This
period, then, of my life, O Lord, of which I have no remembrance, which
I believe on the word of others, and which I guess from other infants,
it chagrins me—true though the guess be—to reckon in this life of mine
which I lead in this world; inasmuch as, in the darkness of my
forgetfulness, it is like to that which I passed in my mother’s womb.
But if “I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive
<span id="page_49">p. 49</span> <span
id="vi.I_1.VII-Page_49"></span>me,” <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156) where, I pray thee, O my God, where,
Lord, or when was I, Thy servant, innocent? But behold, I pass by that
time, for what have I to do with that, the memories of which I cannot
recall?
