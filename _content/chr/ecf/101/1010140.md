<span id="vi.VIII.X-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.VIII.X-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—He Refutes the Opinion of the
Manichæans as to Two Kinds of Minds,—One Good and the Other Evil.</span>

<span id="vi.VIII.X-p2"></span>22. Let them perish from Thy
presence, <span id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663) O God, as “vain
talkers and deceivers” <span id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664) of the
soul do perish, who, observing that there were two wills in
deliberating, affirm that there are two kinds of minds in us,—one good,
the other evil. <span id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665) They themselves
verily are evil when they hold these evil opinions; and they shall
become good when they hold the truth, and shall consent unto the truth,
that Thy apostle may say unto them, “Ye were sometimes darkness, but now
are ye light in the Lord.” <span id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666) But,
they, desiring to be light, not “in the Lord,” but in themselves,
conceiving the nature of the soul to be the same as that which God
is, <span id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667) are made more gross
darkness; for that through a shocking arrogancy they went farther from
Thee, “the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the
world.” <span id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668) Take heed what you say,
and blush for shame; draw near unto Him and be “lightened,” and your
faces shall not be “ashamed.” <span id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669) I,
when I was deliberating upon serving the Lord my God now, as I had long
purposed,—I it was who willed, I who was unwilling. It was I, even I
myself. I neither willed entirely, nor was entirely unwilling. Therefore
was I at war with myself, and destroyed by myself. And this destruction
overtook me against my will, and yet showed not the presence of another
mind, but the punishment of mine own. <span
id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670) “Now, then, it is no more I that do
it, but sin that dwelleth in me,” <span
id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671) —the punishment of a more unconfined
sin, in that I was a son of Adam.

<span id="vi.VIII.X-p12"></span>23. For if there be as many contrary
natures as there are conflicting wills, there will not now be two
natures only, but many. If any one deliberate whether he should go to
their conventicle, or to the theatre, those men <span
id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672) at once cry out, “Behold, here are two
natures,—one good, drawing this way, another bad, drawing back that way;
for whence else is this indecision between conflicting wills?” But I
reply that both are bad—that which draws to them, and that which draws
back to the theatre. But they believe not that will to be other than
good which draws to them. Supposing, then, one of us <span
id="page_126">p. 126</span> <span id="vi.VIII.X-Page_126"></span>should
deliberate, and through the conflict of his two wills should waver
whether he should go to the theatre or to our church, would not these
also waver what to answer? For either they must confess, which they are
not willing to do, that the will which leads to our church is good, as
well as that of those who have received and are held by the mysteries of
theirs, or they must imagine that there are two evil natures and two
evil minds in one man, at war one with the other; and that will not be
true which they say, that there is one good and another bad; or they
must be converted to the truth, and no longer deny that where any one
deliberates, there is one soul fluctuating between conflicting wills.

<span id="vi.VIII.X-p14"></span>24. Let them no more say, then, when
they perceive two wills to be antagonistic to each other in the same
man, that the contest is between two opposing minds, of two opposing
substances, from two opposing principles, the one good and the other
bad. For Thou, O true God, dost disprove, check, and convince them; like
as when both wills are bad, one deliberates whether he should kill a man
by poison, or by the sword; whether he should take possession of this or
that estate of another’s, when he cannot both; whether he should
purchase pleasure by prodigality, or retain his money by covetousness;
whether he should go to the circus or the theatre, if both are open on
the same day; or, thirdly, whether he should rob another man’s house, if
he have the opportunity; or, fourthly, whether he should commit
adultery, if at the same time he have the means of doing so,—all these
things concurring in the same point of time, and all being equally
longed for, although impossible to be enacted at one time. For they rend
the mind amid four, or even (among the vast variety of things men
desire) more antagonistic wills, nor do they yet affirm that there are
so many different substances. Thus also is it in wills which are good.
For I ask them, is it a good thing to have delight in reading the
apostle, or good to have delight in a sober psalm, or good to discourse
on the gospel? To each of these they will answer, “It is good.” What,
then, if all equally delight us, and all at the same time? Do not
different wills distract the mind, when a man is deliberating which he
should rather choose? Yet are they all good, and are at variance until
one be fixed upon, whither the whole united will may be borne, which
before was divided into many. Thus, also, when above eternity delights
us, and the pleasure of temporal good holds us down below, it is the
same soul which willeth not that or this with an entire will, and is
therefore torn asunder with grievous perplexities, while out of truth it
prefers that, but out of custom forbears not this.
