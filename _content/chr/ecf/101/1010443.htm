<p class="c40"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p3"></A><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p3.1"></A>From Augustin to Jerome on James II. 10.</span></p>  
<p><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p4"></A><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p4.1"></A>Chap. I.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p5"></A>1. My brother Jerome, esteemed worthy to be honoured in Christ by me, when I wrote to you propounding this question concerning the human soul,&#8212;if a new soul be now created for each individual at birth, whence do souls contract the bond of guilt which we assuredly believe to be removed by the sacrament of the grace of Christ, when administered even to new-born children?&#8212;as the letter on that subject grew to the size of a considerable volume, I was unwilling to impose the burden of any other question at that time; but there is a subject which has a much stronger claim on my attention, as it presses more seriously on my mind. I therefore ask you, and in God&#146;s name beseech you, to do something which will, I believe, be of great service to many, namely, to explain to me (or to direct me to any work in which you or any other commentator has already expounded) the sense in which we are to understand these words in the Epistle of James, &#8220;Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2745"></A><A HREF="#fn_2745"><FONT SIZE="1">2746</FONT></A>
 This subject is of such importance that I very greatly <A NAME="page_533"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 533</FONT></A> <a name="vii.1.CLXVII-Page_533"></A>regret that I did not write to you in regard to it long ago.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p7"></A>2. For whereas in the question which I thought it necessary to submit to you concerning the soul, our inquiries were engaged with the investigation of a life wholly past and sunk out of sight in oblivion, in this question we study this present life, and how it must be spent if we would attain to eternal life. As an apt illustration of this remark let me quote an entertaining anecdote. A man had fallen into a well where the quantity of water was sufficient to break his fall and save him from death, but not deep enough to cover his mouth and deprive him of speech. Another man approached, and on seeing him cries out in surprise: &#8220;How did you fall in here?&#8221; He answers: &#8220;I beseech you to plan how you can get me out of this, rather than ask how I fell in.&#8221; So, since we admit and hold as an article of the Catholic faith, that the soul of even a little infant requires to be delivered out of the guilt of sin, as out of a pit, by the grace of Christ, it is sufficient for the soul of such a one that we know the way in which it is saved, even though we should never know the way in which it came into that wretched condition. But I thought it our duty to inquire into this subject, lest we should incautiously hold any one of those opinions concerning the manner of the soul&#146;s becoming united with the body which might contradict the doctrine that the souls of little children require to be delivered, by denying that they are subject to the bond of guilt. This, then, being very firmly held by us, that the soul of every infant needs to be freed from the guilt of sin, and can be freed in no other way except by the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord, if we can ascertain the cause and origin of the evil itself, we are better prepared and equipped for resisting adversaries whose empty talk I call not reasoning but quibbling; if, however, we cannot ascertain the cause, the fact that the origin of this misery is hid from us is no reason for our being slothful in the work which compassion demands from us. In our conflict, however, with those who appear to themselves to know what they do not know, we have an additional strength and safety in not being ignorant of our ignorance on this subject. For there are some things which it is evil not to know; there are other things which cannot be known, or are not necessary to be known, or have no bearing on the life which we seek to obtain; but the question which I now submit to you from the writings of the Apostle James is intimately connected with the course of conduct in which we live, and in which, with a view to life eternal, we endeavour to please God.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p8"></A>3. How, then, I beseech you, are we to understand the words: &#8220;Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all&#8221;? Does this affirm that the person who shall have committed theft, nay, who even shall have said to the rich man, &#8220;Sit thou here&#8221; and to the poor man, &#8220;Stand thou there,&#8221; is guilty of homicide, and adultery, and sacrilege? And if he is not so, how can it be said that a person who has offended in one point has become guilty of all? Or are the things which the apostle said concerning the rich man and the poor man not to be reckoned among those things in one of which if any man offend he becomes guilty of all? But we must remember whence that sentence is taken, and what goes before it, and in what connection it occurs. &#8220;My brethren,&#8221; he says, &#8220;have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of Glory, with respect of persons. For if there come into your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool; are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts? Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which He hath promised to them that love Him? But ye have despised the poor,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2746"></A><A HREF="#fn_2746"><FONT SIZE="1">2747</FONT></A>
&#8212;inasmuch as you have said to the poor man, &#8220;Stand thou there,&#8221; when you would have said to a man with a gold ring, &#8220;Sit thou here in a good place.&#8221; And then there follows a passage explaining and enlarging upon that same conclusion: &#8220;Do not rich men oppress you by their power, and draw you before the judgment-seats? Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called? If ye fulfil the royal law according to the Scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: but if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2747"></A><A HREF="#fn_2747"><FONT SIZE="1">2748</FONT></A>
 See how the apostle calls those transgressors of the law who say to the rich man, &#8220;Sit here,&#8221; and to the poor, &#8220;Stand there.&#8221; See how, lest they should think it a trifling sin to transgress the law in this one thing, he goes on to add: &#8220;Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou do not kill, yet, if thou commit adultery, thou art become a transgressor of the law,&#8221; according to that which he had said: &#8220;Ye are convinced of the law as transgressors.&#8221; Since these things are so, it seems to follow, unless it can be shown that we are to understand it in some other way, <A NAME="page_534"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 534</FONT></A> <a name="vii.1.CLXVII-Page_534"></A>that he who says to the rich man, &#8220;Sit here,&#8221; and to the poor, &#8220;Stand there,&#8221; not treating the one with the same respect as the other, is to be judged guilty as an idolater, and a blasphemer, and an adulterer, and a murderer&#8212;in short,&#8212;not to enumerate all, which would be tedious,&#8212;as guilty of all crimes, since, offending in one, he is guilty of all.&#8221;</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p11"></A><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p11.1"></A>Chap. II.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p12"></A>4. But has he who has one virtue all virtues? and has he no virtues who lacks one? If this be true, the sentence of the apostle is thereby confirmed. But what I desire is to have the sentence explained, not confirmed, since of itself it stands more sure in our esteem than all the authority of philosophers could make it. And even if what has just been said concerning virtues and vices were true, it would not follow that therefore all sins are equal. For as to the inseparable co-existence of the virtues, this is a doctrine in regard to which, if I remember rightly, what, indeed, I have almost forgotten (though perhaps I am mistaken), all philosophers who affirm that virtues are essential to the right conduct of life are agreed. The doctrine of the equality of sins, however, the Stoics alone dared to maintain in opposition to the unanimous sentiments of mankind: an absurd tenet, which in writing against Jovinianus (a Stoic in this opinion, but an Epicurean in following after and defending pleasure) you have most clearly refuted from the Holy Scriptures.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2748"></A><A HREF="#fn_2748"><FONT SIZE="1">2749</FONT></A>
 In that most delightful and noble dissertation you have made it abundantly plain that it has not been the doctrine of our authors, or rather of the Truth Himself, who has spoken through them, that all sins are equal. I shall now do my utmost in endeavouring, with the help of God, to show how it can be that, although the doctrine of philosophers concerning virtues is true, we are nevertheless not compelled to admit the Stoics&#146; doctrine that all sins are equal. If I succeed, I will look for your approbation, and in whatever respect I come short, I beg you to supply my deficiencies.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p14"></A>5. Those who maintain that he who has one virtue has all, and that he who lacks one lacks all, reason correctly from the fact that prudence cannot be cowardly, nor unjust, nor intemperate; for if it were any of these it would no longer be prudence. Moreover, if it be prudence only when it is brave, and just, and temperate, assuredly wherever it exists it must have the other virtues along with it. In like manner, also, courage cannot be imprudent, or intemperate, or unjust; temperance must of necessity be prudent, brave, and just; and justice does not exist unless it be prudent, brave, and temperate. Thus, wherever any one of these virtues truly exists, the others likewise exist; and where some are absent, that which may appear in some measure to resemble virtue is not really present.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p15"></A>6. There are, as you know, some vices opposed to virtues by a palpable contrast, as imprudence is the opposite of prudence. But there are some vices opposed to virtues simply because they are vices which, nevertheless, by a deceitful appearance resemble virtues; as, for example, in the relation, not of imprudence, but of craftiness to the said virtue of prudence. I speak here of that craftiness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2749"></A><A HREF="#fn_2749"><FONT SIZE="1">2750</FONT></A>
 which is wont to be understood and spoken of in connection with the evilly disposed, not in the sense in which the word is usually employed in our Scriptures, where it is often used in a good sense, as, &#8220;Be crafty as serpents,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2750"></A><A HREF="#fn_2750"><FONT SIZE="1">2751</FONT></A>
 and again, to give craftiness to the simple.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2751"></A><A HREF="#fn_2751"><FONT SIZE="1">2752</FONT></A>
 It is true that among heathen writers one of the most accomplished of Latin authors, speaking of Catiline, has said: &#8220;Nor was there lacking on his part craftiness to guard against danger,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2752"></A><A HREF="#fn_2752"><FONT SIZE="1">2753</FONT></A>
 using &#8220;craftiness&#8221; (astutia) in a good sense; but the use of the word in this sense is among them very rare, among us very common. So also in regard to the virtues classed under temperance. Extravagance is most manifestly opposite to the virtue of frugality; but that which the common people are wont to call niggardliness is indeed a vice, yet one which, not in its nature, but by a very deceitful similarity of appearance, usurps the name of frugality. In the same manner injustice is by a palpable contrast opposed to justice; but the desire of avenging oneself is wont often to be a counterfeit of justice, but it is a vice. There is an obvious contrariety between courage and cowardice; but hardihood, though differing from courage in nature, deceives us by its resemblance to that virtue. Firmness is a part of virtue; fickleness is a vice far removed from and undoubtedly opposed to it; but obstinacy lays claim to the name of firmness, yet is wholly different, because firmness is a virtue, and obstinacy is a vice.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p20"></A>7. To avoid the necessity of again going over the same ground, let us take one case as an example, from which all others may be understood. Catiline, as those who have written concerning him had means of knowing, was capable of enduring cold, thirst, hunger, and patient in fastings, cold, and watchings beyond what any one could believe, and thus he appeared, both to himself and to his followers, a man endowed with great courage.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2753"></A><A HREF="#fn_2753"><FONT SIZE="1">2754</FONT></A>
 But this courage was not prudent, for he chose the evil instead of the <A NAME="page_535"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 535</FONT></A> <a name="vii.1.CLXVII-Page_535"></A>good; was not temperate, for his life was disgraced by the lowest dissipation; was not just, for he conspired against his country; and therefore it was not courage, but hardihood usurping the name of courage to deceive fools; for if it had been courage, it would not have been a vice but a virtue, and if it had been a virtue, it would never have been abandoned by the other virtues, its inseparable companions.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p22"></A>8. On this account, when it is asked also concerning vices, whether where one exists all in like manner exist, or where one does not exist none exist, it would be a difficult matter to show this, because two vices are wont to be opposed to one virtue, one that is evidently opposed, and another that bears an apparent likeness. Hence the hardihood of Catiline is the more easily seen not to have been courage, since it had not along with it other virtues; but it may be difficult to convince men that his hardihood was cowardice, since he was in the habit of enduring and patiently submitting to the severest hardships to a degree almost incredible. But perhaps, on examining the matter more closely, this hardihood itself is seen to be cowardice, because he shrunk from the toil of those liberal studies by which true courage is acquired. Nevertheless, as there are rash men who are not guilty of cowardice, and there are cowardly men who are not guilty of rashness, and since in both there is vice, for the truly brave man neither ventures rashly nor fears without reason, we are forced to admit that vices are more numerous than virtues.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p23"></A>9. Accordingly, it happens sometimes that one vice is supplanted by another, as the love of money by the love of praise. Occasionally, one vice quits the field that more may take its place, as in the case of the drunkard, who, after becoming temperate in the use of drink, may come under the power of niggardliness and ambition. It is possible, therefore, that vices may give place to vices, not to virtues, as their successors, and thus they are more numerous. When one virtue, however, has entered, there will infallibly be (since it brings all the other virtues along with it) a retreat of all vices whatsoever that were in the man; for all vices were not in him, but at one time so many, at another a greater or smaller number might occupy their place.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p24"></A><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p24.1"></A>Chap. III.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p25"></A>10. We must inquire more carefully whether these things are so; for the statement that &#8220;he who has one virtue has all, and that all virtues are awanting to him who lacks one,&#8221; is not given by inspiration, but is the view held by many men, ingenious, indeed, and studious, but still men. But I must avow that, in the case&#8212;I shall not say of one of those from whose name the word virtue is said to be derived,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2754"></A><A HREF="#fn_2754"><FONT SIZE="1">2755</FONT></A>
 but even of a woman who is faithful to her husband, and who is so from a regard to the commandments and promises of God, and, first of all, is faithful to Him, I do not know how I could say of her that she is unchaste, or that chastity is no virtue or a trifling one. I should feel the same in regard to a husband who is faithful to his wife; and yet there are many such, none of whom I could affirm to be without any sins, and doubtless the sin which is in them, whatever it be, proceeds from some vice. Whence it follows that though conjugal fidelity in religious men and women is undoubtedly a virtue, for it is neither a nonentity nor a vice, yet it does not bring along with it all virtues, for if all virtues were there, there would be no vice, and if there were no vice, there would be no sin; but where is the man who is altogether without sin? Where, therefore, is the man who is without any vice, that is, fuel or root, as it were, of sin, when he who reclined on the breast of the Lord says, &#8220;If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us&#8221;?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2755"></A><A HREF="#fn_2755"><FONT SIZE="1">2756</FONT></A>
 It is not necessary for us to urge this at greater length in writing to you, but I make the statement for the sake of others who perhaps shall read this. For you, indeed, in that same splendid work against Jovinianus, have carefully proved this from the Holy Scriptures; in which work also you have quoted the words, &#8220;in many things we all offend,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2756"></A><A HREF="#fn_2756"><FONT SIZE="1">2757</FONT></A>
 from this very epistle in which occur the words whose meaning we are now investigating. For though it is an apostle of Christ who is speaking, he does not say, &#8220;ye offend,&#8221; but, &#8220;we offend;&#8221; and although in the passage under consideration he says, &#8220;Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2757"></A><A HREF="#fn_2757"><FONT SIZE="1">2758</FONT></A>
 in the words just quoted he affirms that we offend not in one thing but in <i>many</i>, and not that some offend but that we <i>all</i> offend.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p30"></A>11. Far be it, however, from any believer to think that so many thousands of the servants of Christ, who, lest they should deceive themselves, and the truth should not be in them, sincerely confess themselves to have sin, are altogether without virtue! For wisdom is a great virtue, and wisdom herself has said to man, &#8220;Behold the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2758"></A><A HREF="#fn_2758"><FONT SIZE="1">2759</FONT></A>
 Far be it from us, then, to say that so many and so great believing and pious men have not the fear of the Lord, which the Greeks call <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p31.2"></A>&#949;&#8016;&#963;&#8051;&#946;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>, or more literally and fully, <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p31.3"></A>&#952;&#949;&#959;&#963;&#8051;&#946;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>. And what is the fear of the Lord but His worship? and whence is He truly worshipped except from love? Love, then, out of a pure heart, and a <A NAME="page_536"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 536</FONT></A> <a name="vii.1.CLXVII-Page_536"></A>good conscience, and faith unfeigned, is the great and true virtue, because it is &#8220;the end of the commandment.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2759"></A><A HREF="#fn_2759"><FONT SIZE="1">2760</FONT></A>
 Deservedly is love said to be &#8220;strong as death,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2760"></A><A HREF="#fn_2760"><FONT SIZE="1">2761</FONT></A>
 because, like death, it is vanquished by none; or because the measure of love in this life is even unto death, as the Lord says, &#8220;Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2761"></A><A HREF="#fn_2761"><FONT SIZE="1">2762</FONT></A>
 or, rather, because, as death forcibly separates the soul from the senses of the body, so love separates it from fleshly lusts. Knowledge, when it is of the right kind, is the handmaid to love, for without love &#8220;knowledge puffeth up,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2762"></A><A HREF="#fn_2762"><FONT SIZE="1">2763</FONT></A>
 but where love, by edifying, has filled the heart, there knowledge will find nothing empty which it can puff up. Moreover, Job has shown, what is that useful knowledge by defining it where, after saying, &#8220;The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom&#8221; he adds &#8220;and to depart from evil, that is understanding.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2763"></A><A HREF="#fn_2763"><FONT SIZE="1">2764</FONT></A>
 Why do we not then say that the man who has this virtue has all virtues, since &#8220;love is the fulfilling of the law?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2764"></A><A HREF="#fn_2764"><FONT SIZE="1">2765</FONT></A>
 Is it not true that, the more love exists in a man the more he is endowed with virtue, and the less love he has the less virtue is in him, for love is itself virtue; and the less virtue there is in a man so much the more vice will there be in him? Therefore, where love is full and perfect, no vice will remain.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p38"></A>12. The Stoics, therefore, appear to me to be mistaken in refusing to admit that a man who is advancing in wisdom has any wisdom at all, and in affirming that he alone has it who has become altogether perfect in wisdom. They do not, indeed, deny that he has made progress, but they say that he is in no degree entitled to be called wise, unless, by emerging, so to speak, from the depths, he suddenly springs forth into the free air of wisdom. For, as it matters not when a man is drowning whether the depth of water above him be many stadia or only the breadth of a hand or finger, so they say in regard to the progress of those who are advancing towards wisdom, that they are like men rising from the bottom of a whirlpool towards the air, but that unless they by their progress, so escape as to emerge wholly from folly as from an overwhelming flood, they have not virtue and are not wise; but that, when they have so escaped, they immediately have wisdom in perfection, and not a vestige of folly whence any sin could be originated remains.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p39"></A>13. This simile, in which folly is compared to water and wisdom to air, so that the mind emerging, as it were, from the stifling influence of folly breathes suddenly the free air of wisdom, does not appear to me to harmonize sufficiently with the authoritative statement of our Scriptures; a better simile, so far, at least, as illustration of spiritual things can be borrowed from material things, is that which compares vice or folly to darkness, and virtue or wisdom to light. The way to wisdom is therefore not like that of a man rising from the water into the air, in which, in the moment of rising above the surface of the water, he suddenly breathes freely, but, like that of a man proceeding from darkness into light, on whom more light gradually shines as he advances. So long, therefore, as this is not fully accomplished, we speak of the man as of one going from the dark recesses of a vast cavern towards its entrance, who is more and more influenced by the proximity of the light as he comes nearer to the entrance of the cavern; so that whatever light he has proceeds from the light to which he is advancing, and whatever darkness still remains in him proceeds from the darkness out of which he is emerging. Therefore it is true that in the sight of God &#8220;shall no man living be justified,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2765"></A><A HREF="#fn_2765"><FONT SIZE="1">2766</FONT></A>
 and yet that &#8220;the just shall live by his faith.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2766"></A><A HREF="#fn_2766"><FONT SIZE="1">2767</FONT></A>
 On the one hand, &#8220;the saints are clothed with righteousness,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2767"></A><A HREF="#fn_2767"><FONT SIZE="1">2768</FONT></A>
 one more, another less; on the other hand, no one lives here wholly without sin&#8212;one sins more, another less, and the best is the man who sins least.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p43"></A><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p43.1"></A>Chap. IV.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p44"></A>14. But why have I, as if forgetting to whom I address myself, assumed the tone of a teacher in stating the question regarding which I wish to be instructed by you? Nevertheless, as I had resolved to submit to your examination my opinion regarding the equality of sins (a subject involving a question closely bearing on the matter on which I was writing), let me now at last bring my statement to a conclusion. Even though it were true that he who has one virtue has all virtues, and that he who lacks one virtue has none, this would not involve the consequence that all sins are equal; for although it is true that where there is no virtue there is nothing right, it by no means follows that among bad actions one cannot be worse than another, or that divergence from that which is right does not admit of degrees. I think, however, that it is more agreeable to truth and consistent with the Holy Scriptures to say, that what is true of the members of the body is true of the different dispositions of the soul (which, though not seen occupying different places, are by their distinctive workings perceived as plainly as the members of the body), namely, that as in the same body one member is more fully <A NAME="page_537"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 537</FONT></A> <a name="vii.1.CLXVII-Page_537"></A>shone upon by the light, another is less shone upon, and a third is altogether without light, and remains in the dark under some impervious covering, something similar takes place in regard to the various dispositions of the soul. If this be so, then according to the manner in which every man is shone upon by the light of holy love, he may be said to have one virtue and to lack another virtue, or to have one virtue in larger and another in smaller measure. For in reference to that love which is the fear of God, we may correctly say both that it is greater in one man than in another, and that there is some of it in one man, and none of it in another; we may also correctly say as to an individual that he has greater chastity than patience, and that he has either virtue in a higher degree than he had yesterday, if he is making progress, or that he still lacks self-control, but possesses, at the same time, a large measure of compassion.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p45"></A>15. To sum up generally and briefly the view which, so far as relates to holy living, I entertain concerning virtue,&#8212;virtue is the love with which that which ought to be loved is loved. This is in some greater, in others less, and there are men in whom it does not exist at all; but in the absolute fulness which admits of no increase, it exists in no man while living on this earth; so long, however, as it admits of being increased there can be no doubt that, in so far as it is less than it ought to be, the shortcoming proceeds from vice. Because of this vice there is &#8220;not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2768"></A><A HREF="#fn_2768"><FONT SIZE="1">2769</FONT></A>
 because of this vice, &#8220;in God&#146;s sight shall no man living be justified.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2769"></A><A HREF="#fn_2769"><FONT SIZE="1">2770</FONT></A>
 On account of this vice, &#8220;if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2770"></A><A HREF="#fn_2770"><FONT SIZE="1">2771</FONT></A>
 On account of this also, whatever progress we may have made, we must say, &#8220;Forgive us our debts,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2771"></A><A HREF="#fn_2771"><FONT SIZE="1">2772</FONT></A>
 although all debts in word, deed, and thought were washed away in baptism. He, then, who sees aright, sees whence, and when, and where he must hope for that perfection to which nothing can be added. Moreover, if there had been no commandments, there would have been no means whereby a man might certainly examine himself and see from what things he ought to turn aside, whither he should aspire, and in what things he should find occasion for thanksgiving or for prayer. Great, therefore, is the benefit of commandments, if to free will so much liberty be granted that the grace of God may be more abundantly honoured.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p50"></A><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p50.1"></A>Chap. V.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p51"></A>16. If these things be so, how shall a man who shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, be guilty of all? May it not be, that since the fulfilling of the law is that love wherewith we love God and our neighbour, on which commandments of love &#8220;hang all the law and the prophets,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2772"></A><A HREF="#fn_2772"><FONT SIZE="1">2773</FONT></A>
 he is justly held to be guilty of all who violates that on which all hang? Now, no one sins without violating this love; &#8220;for this, thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shall do no murder; thou shall not steal; thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2773"></A><A HREF="#fn_2773"><FONT SIZE="1">2774</FONT></A>
 No one, however, loves his neighbour who does not out of his love to God do all in his power to bring his neighbour also, whom he loves as himself, to love God, whom if he does not love, he neither loves himself nor his neighbour. Hence it is true that if a man shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he becomes guilty of all, because he does what is contrary to the love on which hangs the whole law. A man, therefore, becomes guilty of all by doing what is contrary to that on which all hang.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p54"></A>17. Why, then, may not all sins be said to be equal? May not the reason be, that the transgression of the law of love is greater in him who commits a more grievous sin, and is less in him who commits a less grievous sin? And in the mere fact of his committing any sin whatever, he becomes guilty of all; but in committing a more grievous sin, or in sinning in more respects than one, he becomes more guilty; committing a less grievous sin, or sinning in fewer respects, he becomes less guilty,&#8212;his guilt being thus so much the greater the more he has sinned, the less the less he has sinned. Nevertheless, even though it be only in one point that he offend, he is guilty of all, because he violates that love on which all hang. If these things be true, an explanation is by this means found, clearing up that saying of the man of apostolic grace, &#8220;In many things we offend all.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2774"></A><A HREF="#fn_2774"><FONT SIZE="1">2775</FONT></A>
 For we all offend, but one more grievously, another more slightly, according as each may have committed a more grievous or a less grievous sin; every one being great in the practice of sin in proportion as he is deficient in loving God and his neighbour, and, on the other hand, decreasing in the practice of sin in proportion as he increases in the love of God and of his neighbour. The more, therefore, that a man is deficient in love, the more is he full of sin. And perfection in love is reached when nothing of sinful infirmity remains in us.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p56"></A>18. Nor, indeed, in my opinion, are we to esteem it a trifling sin &#8220;to have the faith of our <A NAME="page_538"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 538</FONT></A> <a name="vii.1.CLXVII-Page_538"></A>Lord Jesus Christ with respect of persons,&#8221; if we take the difference between sitting and standing, of which mention is made in the context, to refer to ecclesiastical honours; for who can bear to see a rich man chosen to a place of honour in the Church, while a poor man, of superior qualifications and of greater holiness, is despised? If, however, the apostle speaks there of our daily assemblies, who does not offend in the matter? At the same time, only those really offend here who cherish in their hearts the opinion that a man&#146;s worth is to be estimated according to his wealth; for this seems to be the meaning of the expression, &#8220;Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?&#8221;</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p57"></A>19. The law of liberty, therefore, the law of love, is that of which he says: &#8220;If ye fulfil the royal law according to the Scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: but if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2775"></A><A HREF="#fn_2775"><FONT SIZE="1">2776</FONT></A>
 And then (after the difficult sentence, &#8220;Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all,&#8221; concerning which I have with sufficient fulness stated my opinion), making mention of the same law of liberty, he says: &#8220;So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.&#8221; And as he knew by experience what he had said a little before, &#8220;in many things we offend all,&#8221; he suggests a sovereign remedy, to be applied, as it were day by day, to those less serious but real wounds which the soul suffers day by day, for he says: &#8220;He shall have judgment without mercy that hath showed no mercy.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2776"></A><A HREF="#fn_2776"><FONT SIZE="1">2777</FONT></A>
 For with the same purpose the Lord says: &#8220;Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: give, and it shall be given unto you.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2777"></A><A HREF="#fn_2777"><FONT SIZE="1">2778</FONT></A>
 After which the apostle says: &#8220;But mercy rejoiceth over judgment:&#8221; it is not said that mercy prevails over judgment, for it is not an adversary of judgment, but it &#8220;rejoiceth&#8221; over judgment, because a greater number are gathered in by mercy; but they are those who have shown mercy, for, &#8220;Blessed are the merciful, for God shall have mercy on them.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2778"></A><A HREF="#fn_2778"><FONT SIZE="1">2779</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p62"></A>20. It is, therefore, by all means just that they be forgiven, because they have forgiven others, and that what they need be given to them, because they have given to others. For God uses mercy when He judgeth, and uses judgment when He showeth mercy. Hence the Psalmist says: &#8220;I will sing of mercy and of judgment unto Thee, O Lord.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2779"></A><A HREF="#fn_2779"><FONT SIZE="1">2780</FONT></A>
 For if any man, thinking himself too righteous to require mercy, presumes, as if he had no reason for anxiety, to wait for judgment without mercy, he provokes that most righteous indignation through fear of which the Psalmist said: &#8220;Enter not into judgment with Thy servant.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2780"></A><A HREF="#fn_2780"><FONT SIZE="1">2781</FONT></A>
 For this reason the Lord says to a disobedient people: &#8220;Wherefore will ye contend with me in judgment?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2781"></A><A HREF="#fn_2781"><FONT SIZE="1">2782</FONT></A>
 For when the righteous King shall sit upon His throne, who shall boast that he has a pure heart, or who shall boast that he is clean from sin? What hope is there then unless mercy shall &#8220;rejoice over&#8221; judgment? But this it will do only in the case of those who have showed mercy, saying with sincerity, &#8220;Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,&#8221; and who have given without murmuring, for &#8220;the Lord loveth a cheerful giver.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2782"></A><A HREF="#fn_2782"><FONT SIZE="1">2783</FONT></A>
 To conclude, St. James is led to speak thus concerning works of mercy in this passage, in order that he may console those whom the statements immediately foregoing might have greatly alarmed, his purpose being to admonish us how those daily sins from which our life is never free here below may also be expiated by daily remedies; lest any man, becoming guilty of all when he offends in even one point, be brought, by offending in many points (since &#8220;in many things we all offend&#8221;), to appear before the bar of the Supreme Judge under the enormous amount of guilt which has accumulated by degrees, and find at that tribunal no mercy, because he showed no mercy to others, instead of rather meriting the forgiveness of his own sins, and the enjoyment of the gifts promised in Scripture, by his extending forgiveness and bounty to others.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXVII-p67"></A>21. I have written at great length, which may perhaps have been tedious to you, as you, although approving of the statements now made, do not expect to be addressed as if you were but learning truths which you have been accustomed to teach to others. If, however, there be anything in these statements&#8212;not in the style of language in which they are expounded, for I am not much concerned as to mere phrases, but in the substance of the statements&#8212;which your erudite judgment condemns, I beseech you to point this out to me in your reply, and do not hesitate to correct my error. For I pity the man who, in view of the unwearied labour and sacred character of your studies, does not on account of them both render to you the honour which you deserve, and give thanks unto our Lord God by whose grace you are what you are. Wherefore, since I ought to be more willing to learn from any teacher the things of which to my disadvantage I am ignorant, than prompt to teach any others what I know, with how much greater reason do I claim the payment of <A NAME="page_539"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 539</FONT></A> <a name="vii.1.CLXVII-Page_539"></A>this debt of love from you, by whose learning ecclesiastical literature in the Latin tongue has been, in the Lord&#146;s name, and by His help, advanced to an extent which had been previously unattainable. Especially, however, I ask attention to the sentence: &#8220;Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and offend in one point, is guilty of all.&#8221; If you know any better way, my beloved brother, in which it can be explained, I beseech you by the Lord to favour us by communicating to us your exposition.</p>
