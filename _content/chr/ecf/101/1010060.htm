<p class="c41"><a name="vi.IV.I-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="vi.IV.I-p1.1"></A>Chapter I.&#8212;Concerning that Most Unhappy Time in Which He, Being Deceived, Deceived Others; And Concerning the Mockers of His Confession.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vi.IV.I-p2"></A>1. <span class="c9"><a name="vi.IV.I-p2.1"></A>During</span> this space of nine years, then, from my nineteenth to my eight and twentieth year, we went on seduced and seducing, deceived and deceiving, in divers lusts; publicly, by sciences which they style &#8220;liberal&#8221;&#8212;secretly, with a falsity called religion. Here proud, there superstitious, everywhere vain! Here, striving after the emptiness of popular fame, even to theatrical applauses, and poetic contests, and strifes for grassy garlands, and the follies of shows and the intemperance of desire. There, seeking to be purged from these our corruptions by carrying food to those who were called &#8220;elect&#8221; and &#8220;holy,&#8221; out of which, in the laboratory of their stomachs, they should make for us angels and gods, by whom we might be delivered.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_265"></A><A HREF="#fn_265"><FONT SIZE="1">266</FONT></A>
 These things did I follow eagerly, and practise with my friends&#8212;by me and with me deceived. Let the arrogant, and such as have not been yet savingly cast down and stricken by Thee, O my God, laugh at me; but notwithstanding I would confess to Thee mine own shame in Thy praise. Bear with me, I beseech Thee, and give me grace to retrace in my present remembrance the circlings of my past errors, and to &#8220;offer to Thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_266"></A><A HREF="#fn_266"><FONT SIZE="1">267</FONT></A>
 For what am I to myself without Thee, but a guide to mine own downfall? Or what am I even at the best, but one sucking Thy milk,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_267"></A><A HREF="#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">268</FONT></A>
 and feeding upon Thee, the meat that perisheth not?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_268"></A><A HREF="#fn_268"><FONT SIZE="1">269</FONT></A>
 But what kind of man is any man, seeing that he is but a man? Let, then, the strong and the mighty laugh at us, but let us who are &#8220;poor and needy&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_269"></A><A HREF="#fn_269"><FONT SIZE="1">270</FONT></A>
 confess unto Thee.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="vi.IV.I-p3"></A> Augustin tells us that he went not beyond the rank of a &#8220;hearer,&#8221; because he found the Manich&aelig;an teachers readier in refuting others than in establishing their own views, and seems only to have looked for some esoteric doctrine to have been disclosed to him under their materialistic teaching as to God&#8212;viz. that He was an unmeasured Light that extended all ways but one, infinitely (<i>Serm.</i> iv. sec 5.)&#8212;rather than to have really accepted it.&#8212;<i>De Util. Cred. Pr&aelig;f.</i> See also iii. sec. 18, notes 1 and 2, above.</p>
