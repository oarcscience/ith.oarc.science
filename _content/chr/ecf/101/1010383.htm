<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.LXXVII-p4"></A>1. I do not wonder to see the minds of believers disturbed by Satan, whom resist, continuing in the hope which rests on the promises of God, who cannot lie, who has not only condescended to promise in eternity rewards to us who believe and hope in Him, and who persevere in love unto the end, but has also foretold that in time offences by which our faith must be tried and proved shall not be wanting; for He said, &#8220;Because iniquity shall abound, the love <A NAME="page_345"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 345</FONT></A> <a name="vii.1.LXXVII-Page_345"></A>of many shall wax cold;&#8221; but He added immediately, &#8220;and he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1968"></A><A HREF="#fn_1968"><FONT SIZE="1">1969</FONT></A>
 Why, therefore, should it seem strange that men bring calumnies against the servants of God, and being unable to turn them aside from an upright life, endeavour to blacken their reputation, seeing that they do not cease uttering blasphemies daily against God, the Lord of these servants, if they are displeased by anything in which the execution of His righteous and secret counsel is contrary to their desire? Wherefore I appeal to your wisdom, my lords most beloved, and brethren worthy of all honour, and exhort you to exercise your minds in the way which best becomes Christians, setting over against the empty calumnies and groundless suspicions of men the written word of God, which has foretold that these things should come, and has warned us to meet them with fortitude.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.LXXVII-p6"></A>2. Let me therefore say in a few words to your Charity, that the presbyter Boniface has not been discovered by me to be guilty of any crime, and that I have never believed, and do not yet believe, any charge brought against him. How, then, could I order his name to be deleted from the roll of presbyters, when filled with alarm by that word of our Lord in the gospel: &#8220;With what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged&#8221;?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1969"></A><A HREF="#fn_1969"><FONT SIZE="1">1970</FONT></A>
 For, seeing that the dispute which has arisen between him and Spes has by their consent been submitted to divine arbitration in a way which, if you desire it, can be made known to you,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1970"></A><A HREF="#fn_1970"><FONT SIZE="1">1971</FONT></A>
 who am I, that I should presume to anticipate the divine award by deleting or passing over his name? As a bishop, I ought not rashly to suspect him; and as being only a man, I cannot decide infallibly concerning things which are hidden from me. Even in secular matters, when an appeal has been made to a higher authority, all procedure is sisted while the case awaits the decision from which there is no appeal; because if anything were changed while the matter is depending on his arbitration, this would be an insult to the higher tribunal. And how great the distance between even the highest human authority and the divine!</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.LXXVII-p9"></A>May the mercy of the Lord our God never forsake you, my lords most beloved, and brethren worthy of all honour.</p>
