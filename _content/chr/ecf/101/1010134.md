<span id="vi.VIII.IV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.VIII.IV-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—He Shows by the Example of
Victorinus that There is More Joy in the Conversion of Nobles.</span>

<span id="vi.VIII.IV-p2"></span>9. Haste, Lord, and act; stir us up, and
call us back; inflame us, and draw us to Thee; stir <span
id="page_120">p. 120</span> <span id="vi.VIII.IV-Page_120"></span>us up,
and grow sweet unto us; let us now love Thee, let us “run after
Thee.” <span id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629) Do not many men, out of a
deeper hell of blindness than that of Victorinus, return unto Thee, and
approach, and are enlightened, receiving that light, which they that
receive, receive power from Thee to become Thy sons? <span
id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630) But if they be less known among the
people, even they that know them joy less for them. For when many
rejoice together, the joy of each one is the fuller in that they are
incited and inflamed by one another. Again, because those that are known
to many influence many towards salvation, and take the lead with many to
follow them. And, therefore, do they also who preceded them much rejoice
in regard to them, because they rejoice not in them alone. May it be
averted that in Thy tabernacle the persons of the rich should be
accepted before the poor, or the noble before the ignoble; since rather
“Thou hast chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things
which are mighty and base things of the world, and things which are
despised, hast Thou chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to
naught things that are.” <span id="fr_631"></span>[632](#fn_631) And
yet, even that “least of the apostles,” <span
id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632) by whose tongue Thou soundest out
these words, when Paulus the proconsul <span
id="fr_633"></span>[634](#fn_633) —his pride overcome by the apostle’s
warfare—was made to pass under the easy yoke <span
id="fr_634"></span>[635](#fn_634) of Thy Christ, and became a provincial
of the great King,—he also, instead of Saul, his former name, desired to
be called Paul, <span id="fr_635"></span>[636](#fn_635) in testimony of
so great a victory. For the enemy is more overcome in one of whom he
hath more hold, and by whom he hath hold of more. But the proud hath he
more hold of by reason of their nobility; and by them of more, by reason
of their authority. <span id="fr_636"></span>[637](#fn_636) By how much
the more welcome, then, was the heart of Victorinus esteemed, which the
devil had held as an unassailable retreat, and the tongue of Victorinus,
with which mighty and cutting weapon he had slain many; so much the more
abundantly should Thy sons rejoice, seeing that our King hath bound the
strong man, <span id="fr_637"></span>[638](#fn_637) and they saw his
vessels taken from him and cleansed, <span
id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638) and made meet for Thy honour, and
become serviceable for the Lord unto every good work. <span
id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639)

<span id="vi.VIII.IV-p9"></span> “‘As Scipio, after the conquest of
Africa, took the name of Africanus, so Saul also, being sent to preach
to the Gentiles, brought back his trophy out of the first spoils won by
the Church, the proconsul Sergius Paulus, and set up his banner, in that
for Saul he was called Paul’ (Jerome, *Comm. in Ep. ad Philem. init*).
Origen mentions the same opinion (which is indeed suggested by the
relation in the Acts), but thinks that the apostle had originally two
names (*Præf. in Comm. in Ep. ad Rom.*), which, as a Roman, may very
well have been, and yet that he made use of his Roman name Paul first in
connection with the conversion of the proconsul; Chrysostom says that it
was doubtless changed at the command of God, which is to be supposed,
but still may have been at this time.”—E. B. P.

<span id="vi.VIII.IV-p10"></span> “Satan makes choice of *persons of
place and power*. These are either in the Commonwealth or church. If he
can, he will secure the throne and the pulpit, as the two forts that
command the whole line.…A prince or a ruler may stand for a thousand;
therefore saith Paul to Elymas when he would have turned the deputy from
the faith, ‘O full of all subtilty, thou child of the devil!’ ([Acts
13.10](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#010)<span
id="vi.VIII.IV-p10.1"></span>). As if he had said, ‘You have learned
this of your father the devil,—to haunt the courts of princes, wind into
the favour of great ones. There is a double policy Satan hath in gaining
such to his side.—(*a*) None have such advantage to draw others to their
way. Corrupt the captain, and it is hard if he bring not off his troop
with him. When the princes—men of renown in their tribes—stood up with
Korah, presently a multitude are drawn into the conspiracy ([Num.
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#002),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#019)<span
id="vi.VIII.IV-p10.2"></span>). Let Jeroboam set up idolatry, and Israel
is soon in a snare. It is said \[that\] the people willingly walked
after his commandment ([Hos. 5.11](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#011)<span
id="vi.VIII.IV-p10.3"></span>). (b) Should the sin stay at court, and
the infection go no further, yet the sin of such a one, though a good
man, may cost a whole kingdom dear. Satan stood up against Israel, and
provoked David to number Israel ([1 Chron.
21.1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001)<span
id="vi.VIII.IV-p10.4"></span>). He owed Israel a spite, and he pays them
home in their king’s sin, which dropped in a fearful plague upon their
heads,”—<span class="c9"><span
