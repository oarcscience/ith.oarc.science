id="vi.I_1.XVIII-p2.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Men Desire to Observe the
Rules of Learning, But Neglect the Eternal Rules of Everlasting
Safety.</span>

<span id="vi.I_1.XVIII-p3"></span>28. But what matter of surprise is it
that I was thus carried towards vanity, and went forth from Thee, O my
God, when men were proposed to me to imitate, who, should they in
relating any acts of theirs—not in themselves evil—be guilty of a
barbarism or solecism, when censured for it became confounded; but when
they made a full and ornate oration, in well-chosen words, concerning
their own licentiousness, and were applauded for it, they boasted? Thou
seest this, O Lord, and keepest silence, “long-suffering, and plenteous
in mercy and truth,” <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177) as Thou
art. Wilt Thou keep silence for ever? And even now Thou drawest out of
this vast deep the soul that seeketh Thee and thirsteth after Thy
delights, whose “heart said unto Thee,” I have sought Thy face, “Thy
face, Lord, will I seek.” <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178) For I
was far from Thy face, through my darkened <span
id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179) affections. For it is not by our feet,
nor by change of place, that we either turn from Thee or return to Thee.
Or, indeed, did that younger son look out for horses, or chariots, or
ships, or fly away with visible wings, or journey by the motion of his
limbs, that he might, in a far country, prodigally waste all that Thou
gavest him when he set out? A kind Father when Thou gavest, and kinder
still when he returned destitute! <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180) So, then, in wanton, that is to say,
in darkened affections, lies distance from Thy face.

<span id="vi.I_1.XVIII-p8"></span>29. Behold, O Lord God, and behold
patiently, as Thou art wont to do, how diligently the sons of men
observe the conventional rules of letters and syllables, received from
those who spoke prior to them, and yet neglect the eternal rules of
everlasting salvation received from Thee, insomuch that he who practises
or teaches the hereditary rules of pronunciation, if, contrary to
grammatical usage, he should say, without aspirating the first letter, a
*uman* being, will offend men more than if, in opposition to Thy
commandments, he, a human being, were to hate a human being. As if,
indeed, any man should feel that an enemy could be more destructive to
him than that hatred with which he is excited against him, or that he
could destroy more utterly him whom he persecutes than he destroys his
own soul by his enmity. And of a truth, there is no science of letters
more innate than the writing of conscience—that he is doing unto another
what he himself would not suffer. How mysterious art Thou, who in
silence “dwellest on high,” <span id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181) Thou
God, the only great, who by an unwearied law dealest out the punishment
of blindness to illicit desires! When a man seeking for the reputation
of eloquence stands before a human judge while <span id="page_54">p.
54</span> <span id="vi.I_1.XVIII-Page_54"></span>a thronging multitude
surrounds him, inveighs against his enemy with the most fierce hatred,
he takes most vigilant heed that his tongue slips not into grammatical
error, but takes no heed lest through the fury of his spirit he cut off
a man from his fellow-men. <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182)

<span id="vi.I_1.XVIII-p11"></span>30. These were the customs in the
midst of which I, unhappy boy, was cast, and on that arena it was that I
was more fearful of perpetrating a barbarism than, having done so, of
envying those who had not. These things I declare and confess unto Thee,
my God, for which I was applauded by them whom I then thought it my
whole duty to please, for I did not perceive the gulf of infamy wherein
I was cast away from Thine eyes. <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183)
For in Thine eyes what was more infamous than I was already, displeasing
even those like myself, deceiving with innumerable lies both tutor, and
masters, and parents, from love of play, a desire to see frivolous
spectacles, and a stage-stuck restlessness, to imitate them? Pilferings
I committed from my parents’ cellar and table, either enslaved by
gluttony, or that I might have something to give to boys who sold me
their play, who, though they sold it, liked it as well as I In this
play, likewise, I often sought dishonest victories, I myself being
conquered by the vain desire of pre-eminence. And what could I so little
endure, or, if I detected it, censured I so violently, as the very
things I did to others, and, when myself detected I was censured,
preferred rather to quarrel than to yield? Is this the innocence of
childhood? Nay, Lord, nay, Lord; I entreat Thy mercy, O my God. For
these same sins, as we grow older, are transferred from governors and
masters, from nuts, and balls, and sparrows, to magistrates and kings,
to gold, and lands, and slaves, just as the rod is succeeded by more
severe chastisements. It was, then, the stature of childhood that Thou,
O our King, didst approve of as an emblem of humility when Thou saidst:
“Of such is the kingdom of heaven.” <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184)

<span id="vi.I_1.XVIII-p14"></span>31. But yet, O Lord, to Thee, most
excellent and most good, Thou Architect and Governor of the universe,
thanks had been due unto Thee, our God, even hadst Thou willed that I
should not survive my boyhood. For I existed even then; I lived, and
felt, and was solicitous about my own well-being,—a trace of that most
mysterious unity <span id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185) from whence I
had my being; I kept watch by my inner sense over the wholeness of my
senses, and in these insignificant pursuits, and also in my thoughts on
things insignificant, I learnt to take pleasure in truth. I was averse
to being deceived, I had a vigorous memory, was provided with the power
of speech, was softened by friendship, shunned sorrow, meanness,
ignorance. In such a being what was not wonderful and praiseworthy? But
all these are gifts of my God; I did not give them to myself; and they
are good, and all these constitute myself. Good, then, is He that made
me, and He is my God; and before Him will I rejoice exceedingly for
every good gift which, as a boy, I had. For in this lay my sin, that not
in Him, but in His creatures—myself and the rest—I sought for pleasures,
honours, and truths, falling thereby into sorrows, troubles, and errors.
Thanks be to Thee, my joy, my pride, my confidence, my God—thanks be to
Thee for Thy gifts; but preserve Thou them to me. For thus wilt Thou
preserve me; and those things which Thou hast given me shall be
developed and perfected, and I myself shall be with Thee, for from Thee
is my being.

unity worketh congruity and harmony, whereby things composite are in so
far as they are; for things uncompounded are in themselves, because they
are one; but things compounded imitate unity by the harmony of their
parts, and, so far as they attain to unity, they are. Wherefore order
and rule secure being, disorder tends to not being.”—Aug. *De Morib.
Manich.* c. 6.
