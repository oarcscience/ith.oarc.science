<span id="vii.1.II-p3"></span>*<span class="c9"><span

Greeting.</span>* <span id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441)

<span id="vii.1.II-p5"></span>1. We are, I suppose, both agreed in
maintaining that all things with which our bodily senses acquaint us are
incapable of abiding unchanged for a single moment, but, on the
contrary, are moving and in perpetual transition, and have no present
reality, that is, to use the language of Latin philosophy, do not
exist. <span id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442) Accordingly, the true
and divine philosophy admonishes us to check and subdue the love of
these things as most dangerous and disastrous, in order that the mind,
even while using this body, may be wholly occupied and warmly interested
in those things which are ever the same, and which owe their attractive
power to no transient charm. Although this is all true, and although my
mind, without the aid of the senses, sees you as you really are, and as
an object which may be loved without disquietude, nevertheless I must
own that when you are absent in body, and separated by distance, the
pleasure of meeting and seeing you is one which I miss, and which,
therefore, while it is attainable, I earnestly covet. This my infirmity
(for such it must be) is one which, if I know you aright, you are well
pleased to find in me; and though you wish every good thing for your
best and most loved friends, you rather fear than desire that they
should be cured of this infirmity. If, however, your soul has attained
to such strength that you are able both to discern this snare, and to
smile at those who are caught therein, truly you are great, and
different from what I am. For my part, as long as I regret the absence
of any one from me, so long do I wish him to regret my absence. At the
same time, I watch and strive to set my love as little as possible on
anything which can be separated from me against my will. Regarding this
as my duty, I remind you, in the meantime, whatever be your frame of
mind, that the discussion which I have begun with you must be finished,
if we care for each other. For I can by no means consent to its being
finished with Alypius, even if he wished it. But he does not wish this;
for he is not the man to join with me now in endeavouring, by as many
letters as we could send, to detain you with us, when you decline this,
under the pressure of some necessity to us unknown.

<span id="vii.1.II-p4"></span> Zenobius was the friend to whom Augustin
dedicated his books *De Ordine*. In book i. ch. 1 and 2, we have a
delightful description of the character of Zenobius.
