<span id="vi.XIII.VII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XIII.VII-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—That the Holy Spirit Brings Us
to God.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.VII-p2"></span>8. Hence let him that is able now
follow Thy apostle with his understanding where he thus speaks, because
Thy love “is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given
unto us;” <span id="fr_1181"></span>[1182](#fn_1181) and where,
“concerning spiritual gifts,” he teacheth and showeth unto us a more
excellent way of charity; <span id="fr_1182"></span>[1183](#fn_1182) and
where he bows his knees unto Thee for us, that we may know the
super-eminent knowledge of the love of Christ. <span
id="fr_1183"></span>[1184](#fn_1183) And, therefore, from the beginning
was He super-eminently “borne above the waters.” To whom shall I tell
this? How speak of the weight of lustful desires, pressing downwards to
the steep abyss? and how charity raises us up again, through Thy Spirit
which was “borne over the waters?” To whom shall I tell it? How tell it?
For neither are there places in which we are merged and emerge. <span
id="fr_1184"></span>[1185](#fn_1184) What can be more like, and yet more
unlike? They be affections, they be loves; the filthiness of our spirit
flowing away downwards with the love of cares, and the sanctity of Thine
raising us upwards by the love of freedom from care; that we may lift
our hearts <span id="fr_1185"></span>[1186](#fn_1185) unto Thee where
Thy Spirit is “borne over the waters;” and that we may come to that
pre-eminent rest, when our soul shall have passed through the waters
which have no substance. <span id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186)

<span id="vi.XIII.VII-p7"></span> Watts remarks here: “This sentence was
generally in the Church service and communion. Nor is there scarce any
one old liturgy but hath it, *Sursum corda, Habemus ad Dominum.*”
Palmer, speaking of the Lord’s Supper, says, in his *Origines
Liturgicæ.*, iv. 14, that “Cyprian, in the third century, attested the
use of the form, ‘Lift up your hearts,’ and its response, in the liturgy
of Africa (Cyprian, *De Orat. Dom*. p. 152, *Opera*, ed. Fell).
Augustin, at the beginning of the fifth century, speaks of these words
as being used in *all* churches” (Aug. *De Vera Relig*. iii. ). We find
from the same writer, *ibid*. v. 5, that in several churches this
sentence was used in the office of baptism.

<span id="vi.XIII.VII-p8"></span> “Sine substantia,” the *Old Ver*.
rendering of [Ps. cxxiv. 5](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005)<span
id="vi.XIII.VII-p8.1"></span>. The Vulgate gives “aquam intolerabilem.”
The Authorized Version, however, correctly renders the Hebrew by “proud
waters,” that is, *swollen*. Augustin, in *in Ps.* cxxiii. 5, sec. 9,
explains the “aqua sine substantia,” as the water of sins; “for,” he
says, “sins have not substance; they have weakness, not substance; want,
not substance.”
