id="vi.I_1.IV-p2.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The Majesty of God is Supreme,
and His Virtues Inexplicable.</span>

<span id="vi.I_1.IV-p3"></span>4. What, then, art Thou, O my God—what, I
ask, but the Lord God? For who is Lord but the Lord? or who is God save
our God? <span id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133) Most high, most
excellent, most potent, most omnipotent; most piteous and most just;
most hidden and most near; most beauteous and most strong, stable, yet
contained of none; unchangeable, yet changing all things; never new,
never old; making all things new, yet bringing old age upon the proud
and they know it not; always working, yet ever at rest; gathering, yet
needing nothing; sustaining, pervading, and protecting; creating,
nourishing, and developing; seeking, and yet possessing all things. Thou
lovest, and burnest not; art jealous, yet free from care; repentest, and
hast no sorrow; art angry, yet serene; changest Thy ways, leaving
unchanged Thy plans; recoverest what Thou findest, having yet never
lost; art never in want, whilst Thou rejoicest in gain; never covetous,
though requiring usury. <span id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134) That
Thou mayest owe, more than enough is given to Thee; <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135) yet who hath anything that is not
Thine? Thou payest debts while owing nothing; and when Thou forgivest
debts, losest nothing. Yet, O my God, my life, my holy joy, what is this
that I have said? And what saith any man when He speaks of Thee? Yet woe
to them that keep silence, seeing that even they who say most are as the
dumb. <span id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136)

<span id="vi.I_1.IV-p7"></span> “As it is impossible for mortal,
imperfect, and perishable man to comprehend the immortal, perfect and
eternal, we cannot expect that he should be able to express in praise
the fulness of God’s attributes. The Talmud relates of a rabbi, who did
not consider the terms, ‘the great, mighty, and fearful God,’ which
occur in the daily prayer, as being sufficient, but added some more
attributes—‘What!’ exclaimed another rabbi who was present, ‘imaginest
thou to be able to exhaust the praise of God? Thy praise is blasphemy.
Thou hadst better be quiet.’ Hence the Psalmist’s exclamation, after
finding that the praises of God were inexhaustible: הלהת הּימוד ךל,
‘Silence is praise to Thee.’”—<span class="c9"><span
