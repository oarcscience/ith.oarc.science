id="vi.IV.VII-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Troubled by Restlessness and
Grief, He Leaves His Country a Second Time for Carthage.</span>

<span id="vi.IV.VII-p2"></span>12. O madness, which knowest not how to
love men as men should be loved! O foolish man that I then was, enduring
with so much impatience the lot of man! So I fretted, sighed, wept,
tormented myself, and took neither rest nor advice. For I bore about
with me a rent and polluted soul, impatient of being borne by me, and
where to repose it I found not. Not <span id="page_72">p. 72</span>
<span id="vi.IV.VII-Page_72"></span>in pleasant groves, not in sport or
song, not in fragrant spots, nor in magnificent banquetings, nor in the
pleasures of the bed and the couch, nor, finally, in books and songs did
it find repose. All things looked terrible, even the very light itself;
and whatsoever was not what he was, was repulsive and hateful, except
groans and tears, for in those alone found I a little repose. But when
my soul was withdrawn from them, a heavy burden of misery weighed me
down. To Thee, O Lord, should it have been raised, for Thee to lighten
and avert it. <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296) This I knew, but
was neither willing nor able; all the more since, in my thoughts of
Thee, Thou wert not any solid or substantial thing to me. For Thou wert
not Thyself, but an empty phantasm, <span
id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297) and my error was my god. If I
attempted to discharge my burden thereon, that it might find rest, it
sank into emptiness, and came rushing down again upon me, and I remained
to myself an unhappy spot, where I could neither stay nor depart from.
For whither could my heart fly from my heart? Whither could I fly from
mine own self? Whither not follow myself? And yet fled I from my
country; for so should my eyes look less for him where they were not
accustomed to see him. And thus I left the town of Thagaste, and came to
Carthage.
