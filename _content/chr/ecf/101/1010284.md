<span id="vi.XIII.XVIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XIII.XVIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Of the Lights and Stars of
Heaven—Of Day and Night, Ver. 14.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XVIII-p2"></span>22. Thus, O Lord, thus, I beseech
Thee, let there arise, as Thou makest, as Thou givest joy and
ability,—let “truth spring out of the earth, and righteousness look down
from heaven,” and let there be “lights in the firmament.” <span
id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293) Let us break our bread to the
hungry, and let us bring the houseless poor to our house. <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294) Let us clothe the naked, and
despise not those of our own flesh. The which fruits having sprung forth
from the earth, behold, because it is good; <span
id="fr_1295"></span>[1296](#fn_1295) and let our temporary light burst
forth; <span id="fr_1296"></span>[1297](#fn_1296) and let us, from this
inferior fruit of action, possessing the delights of contemplation and
of the Word of Life above, let us appear as lights in the world, <span
id="fr_1297"></span>[1298](#fn_1297) clinging to the firmament of Thy
Scripture. For therein Thou makest it plain unto us, that we may
distinguish between things intelligible and things of sense, as if
between the day and the night; or between souls, given, some to things
intellectual, others to things of sense; so that now not Thou only in
the secret of Thy judgment, as before the firmament was made, dividest
between the light and the darkness, but Thy spiritual children also,
placed and ranked in the same firmament (Thy grace being manifest
throughout the world), may give light upon the earth, and divide between
the day and night, and be for signs of times; because “old things have
passed away,” and “behold all things are become new;” <span
id="fr_1298"></span>[1299](#fn_1298) and “because our salvation is
nearer than when we believed;” <span
id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299) and because “the night is far
spent, the day is at hand;” <span id="fr_1300"></span>[1301](#fn_1300)
and because Thou wilt crown Thy year with blessing, <span
id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301) sending the labourers of Thy
goodness into Thy harvest, <span id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302) in
the sowing of which others have laboured, sending also into another
field, whose harvest shall be in the end. <span
id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303) Thus Thou grantest the prayers of
him that asketh, and blessest the years of the just; <span
id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304) but Thou art the same, and in Thy
years which fail not <span id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305) Thou
preparest a garner for our passing years. For by an eternal counsel Thou
dost in their proper seasons bestow upon the earth heavenly blessings.

<span id="vi.XIII.XVIII-p16"></span>23. For, indeed, to one is given by
the Spirit the word of wisdom, as if the greater light, on account of
those who are delighted with the light of manifest truth, as in the
beginning of the day; but to another the word of knowledge by the same
Spirit, as if the lesser light; <span
id="fr_1306"></span>[1307](#fn_1306) to another faith; to another the
gift of healing; to another the working of miracles; to another
prophecy; to another the discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds
of tongues. And all these as stars. For all these worketh the one and
self-same Spirit, dividing to every man his own as He willeth; <span
id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307) and making stars appear manifestly,
to profit withal. <span id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308) But the
word of knowledge, wherein are contained all sacraments, <span
id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309) which are varied in their periods
like the moon, and the other conceptions of gifts, which are
successively reckoned up as stars, inasmuch as they come short of that
splendour of wisdom in which the fore-mentioned day rejoices, are only
for the beginning of the night. For they are necessary to such as he Thy
most prudent servant could not speak unto as unto spiritual, but as unto
carnal <span id="fr_1310"></span>[1311](#fn_1310) —even he who speaketh
wisdom among those that are perfect. <span
id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311) But the natural man, as a babe in
Christ,—and a drinker of milk,—until he be strengthened for solid
meat, <span id="fr_1312"></span>[1313](#fn_1312) and his eye be enabled
to look upon <span id="page_198">p. 198</span> <span
id="vi.XIII.XVIII-Page_198"></span>the Sun, <span
id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313) let him not dwell in his own
deserted night, but let him be contented with the light of the moon and
the stars. Thou reasonest these things with us, our All-wise God, in Thy
Book, Thy firmament, that we may discern all things in an admirable
contemplation, although as yet in signs, and in times, and in days, and
in years.

<span id="vi.XIII.XVIII-p17"></span> Compare his *De Trin.* xii. 22–55,
where, referring to [1 Cor. 12.8](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008)<span
id="vi.XIII.XVIII-p17.1"></span>, he explains that “knowledge” has to do
with *action*, or that by which we use rightly things temporal; while
wisdom has to do with the *contemplation* of things eternal. See also
*in Ps.* cxxxv. sec. 8.

<span id="vi.XIII.XVIII-p20"></span> [1 Cor.
13.2](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#002)<span
id="vi.XIII.XVIII-p20.1"></span>. The Authorized Version and the Vulgate
render more correctly, “mysteries.” From Palmer (see p. 118, note 3,
above), we learn that “the Fathers gave the name of *sacrament* or
*mystery* to everything which conveyed one signification or property to
unassisted reason, and another to faith;” while, at the same time, they
counted Baptism and the Lord’s Supper as the two great sacraments. The
sacraments, then, used in this sense are “varied in their periods,” and
Augustin, *in Ps.* lxxiii. 2, speaks of distinguishing between the
sacraments of the Old Testament and the sacraments of the New.
“Sacramenta novi Testamenti” he says, “dant salutem, sacramenta veteris
Testamenti promiserunt salvatorem.” So also *in Ps.* xlvi. he says: “Our
Lord God varying, indeed, the sacraments of the words, but commending
unto us one faith, hath diffused through the sacred Scriptures
manifoldly and variously the faith in which we live, and by which we
live. For one and the same thing is said in many ways, that it may be
varied in the manner of speaking in order to prevent aversion, but may
be preserved as one with a view to concord.”

3.2](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#002)<span
id="vi.XIII.XVIII-p23.1"></span>, and [Heb.
5.12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012)<span
id="vi.XIII.XVIII-p23.2"></span>. The allusion in our text is to what is
called the *Disciplina Arcani* of the early Church. Clement of
Alexandria, in his *Stromata*, enters at large into the matter of
esoteric teaching, and traces its use amongst the Hebrews, Greeks, and
Egyptians. Clement, like Chrysostom and other Fathers, supports this
principle of interpretation on the authority of St. Paul in [Heb.
v.](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#000)<span
id="vi.XIII.XVIII-p23.3"></span> and vi., referred to by Augustin above.
He says (as quoted by Bishop Kaye, *Clement of Alexandria*, ch. iv. p.
183): “Babes must be fed with milk, the perfect man with solid food;
milk is catechetical instruction, the first nourishment of the soul;
solid food, contemplation penetrating into all mysteries (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.XIII.XVIII-p23.4"></span>ἡ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.XIII.XVIII-p23.5"></span>ἐποπτικὴ
θεωρία</span>), the blood and flesh of the Word, the comprehension of
the Divine power and essence.” Augustin, therefore, when he speaks of
being “contented with the light of the moon and stars,” alludes to the
partial knowledge imparted to the catechumen during his probationary
period before baptism. It was only as *competentes*, and ready for
baptism, that the catechumens were taught the Lord’s Prayer and the
Creed. We have already adverted to this matter in note 4 on p. 89, and
need not now do more than refer the reader to Dr. Newman’s *Arians.* In
ch. i. sec. 3 of that work, there are some most interesting pages on
this subject, in its connection with the Catechetical School of
Alexandria. See also p. 118, note 8, above; Palmer, *Origines
Liturgicæ*, iv. sec. 7: and note 1, below.

<span id="fn_1313"></span>[198:1314](1010284.htm#fr_1313) <span
id="vi.XIII.XVIII-p23.6"></span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XVIII-p24"></span> Those ready for strong meat were
called “illuminated” (see p. 118, note 4, above), as their eyes were
“enabled to look upon the Sun.” We have frequent traces in Augustin’s
writings of the Neo-Platonic doctrine that the soul has a capacity to
see God, even as the eye the sun. In *Serm.* lxxxviii. 6 he says:
“Daretne tibi unde videres solem quem fecit, et non tibi daret unde
videres eum qui te fecit, cum te ad imaginem suam fecerit?” And,
referring to [1 John iii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002)<span
id="vi.XIII.XVIII-p24.1"></span>, he tells us in *Ep.* xcii. 3, that not
with the bodily eye shall we see God, but with the inner, which is to be
renewed day by day: “We shall, therefore, see Him according to the
measure in which we shall be like Him; because now the measure in which
we do not see Him is according to the measure of our unlikeness to Him.”
Compare also Justin Martyr, *Dialogue with Trypho*, c. 4: “Plato,
indeed, says, that the mind’s eye is of such a nature, and has been
given for this end, that we may see that very Being who is the cause of
all when the mind is pure itself.” Some interesting remarks on this
subject, and on the three degrees of divine knowledge as held by the
Neo-Platonists, will be found in John Smith’s *Select Discourses*, pp. 2
and 165 (Cambridge 1860). On growth in grace, see note 4, p. 140, above.
