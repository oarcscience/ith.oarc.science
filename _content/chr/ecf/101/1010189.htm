<p class="c10"><a name="vi.X.XXXII-p2"></A>48. With the attractions of odours I am not much troubled. When absent I do not seek them; when present I do not refuse them; and am prepared ever to be without them. At any rate thus I appear to myself; perchance I am deceived. For that also is a lamentable darkness wherein my capacity that is in me is concealed, so that my mind, making inquiry into herself concerning her own powers, ventures not readily to credit herself; because that which is already in it is, for the most part, concealed, unless experience reveal it. And no man ought to feel secure&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_922"></A><A HREF="#fn_922"><FONT SIZE="1">923</FONT></A>
 in this life, the whole of which is called a temptation,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_923"></A><A HREF="#fn_923"><FONT SIZE="1">924</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="vi.X.XXXII-p3"></A> &#8220;For some,&#8221; says Thomas Taylor (Works, vol. I. &#8220;Christ&#146;s Temptation,&#8221; p. 11), &#8220;through vain prefidence of God&#146;s protection, run in times of contagion into infected houses, which upon just calling a man may: but for one to run out of his calling in the way of an ordinary visitation, he shall find that God&#146;s angels have commission to protect him no longer than he is in his way (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011">Ps. 91.11</a><a name="vi.X.XXXII-p3.1"></A>), and that being out of it, this arrow of the Lord shall sooner hit him than another that is not half so confident.&#8221; We should not, as Fuller quaintly says, &#8220;hollo in the ears of a sleeping temptation;&#8221; and when we are tempted, let us remember that if (Hibbert, <i>Syntagma Theologicum</i>, p. 342) &#8220;a giant knock while the door is shut, he may with ease be still kept out; but if once open, that he gets in but a limb of himself, then there is no course left to keep out the remaining bulk.&#8221; See also Augustin on Peter&#146;s case, <i>De Corrept. et Grat.</i> c. 9.</p>
