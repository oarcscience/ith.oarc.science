<p class="c41"><a name="vi.XIII.XXVI-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="vi.XIII.XXVI-p1.1"></A>Chapter XXVI.&#8212;In the Confessing of Benefits, Computation is Made Not as to The &#8220;Gift,&#8221; But as to the &#8220;Fruit,&#8221;&#8212;That Is, the Good and Right Will of the Giver.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vi.XIII.XXVI-p2"></A>39. But they who are delighted with them are fed by those fruits; nor are they delighted with them &#8220;whose god is their belly.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1402"></A><A HREF="#fn_1402"><FONT SIZE="1">1403</FONT></A>
 For neither in those that yield them are the things given the fruit, but in what spirit they give them. Therefore he who serves God and not his own belly,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1403"></A><A HREF="#fn_1403"><FONT SIZE="1">1404</FONT></A>
 I plainly see why he may rejoice; I see it, and I rejoice with him exceedingly. For he hath received from the Philippians those things which they had sent from Epaphroditus;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1404"></A><A HREF="#fn_1404"><FONT SIZE="1">1405</FONT></A>
 but yet I see why he rejoiced. For whereat he rejoices, upon that he feeds; for speaking in truth, &#8220;I rejoiced,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again, wherein ye were also careful,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1405"></A><A HREF="#fn_1405"><FONT SIZE="1">1406</FONT></A>
 but it had become wearisome unto you. These Philippians, then, by protracted wearisomeness, had become enfeebled, and as it were dried up, as to bringing forth this fruit of a good work; and he rejoiceth for them, because they flourished again, not for himself, because they ministered to his wants. Therefore, adds he, &#8220;not that I speak in respect of want, for I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1406"></A><A HREF="#fn_1406"><FONT SIZE="1">1407</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vi.XIII.XXVI-p8"></A>40. Whereat, then, dost thou rejoice in all things, O great Paul? Whereat dost thou rejoice? Whereon dost thou feed, O man, re<A NAME="page_204"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 204</FONT></A> <a name="vi.XIII.XXVI-Page_204"></A>newed in the knowledge of God, after the image of Him that created thee, thou living soul of so great continency, and thou tongue like flying fowls, speaking mysteries,&#8212;for to such creatures is this food due,&#8212;what is that which feeds thee? Joy. Let us hear what follows. &#8220;Notwithstanding,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;ye have well done that ye did communicate with My affliction.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1407"></A><A HREF="#fn_1407"><FONT SIZE="1">1408</FONT></A>
 Hereat doth he rejoice, hereon doth he feed; because they have well done,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1408"></A><A HREF="#fn_1408"><FONT SIZE="1">1409</FONT></A>
 not because his strait was relieved, who saith unto thee, &#8220;Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1409"></A><A HREF="#fn_1409"><FONT SIZE="1">1410</FONT></A>
 because he knew both &#8220;to abound and to suffer need,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1410"></A><A HREF="#fn_1410"><FONT SIZE="1">1411</FONT></A>
 in Thee Who strengthenest him. For, saith he, &#8220;ye Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no Church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1411"></A><A HREF="#fn_1411"><FONT SIZE="1">1412</FONT></A>
 Unto these good works he now rejoiceth that they have returned; and is made glad that they flourished again, as when a fruitful field recovers its greenness.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vi.XIII.XXVI-p14"></A>41. Was it on account of his own necessities that he said, &#8220;Ye have sent unto my necessity? Rejoiceth he for that? Verily not for that. But whence know we this? Because he himself continues, &#8220;Not because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1412"></A><A HREF="#fn_1412"><FONT SIZE="1">1413</FONT></A>
 From Thee, O my God, have I learned to distinguish between a &#8220;gift&#8221; and &#8220;fruit.&#8221; A gift is the thing itself which he gives who bestows these necessaries, as money, food, drink, clothing, shelter, aid; but the fruit is the good and right will of the giver. For the good Master saith not only, &#8220;He that receiveth a prophet,&#8221; but addeth, &#8220;in the name of a prophet.&#8221; Nor saith He only, &#8220;He that receiveth a righteous man,&#8221; but addeth, &#8220;in the name of a righteous man.&#8221; So, verily, the former shall receive the reward of a prophet, the latter that of a righteous man. Nor saith He only, &#8220;Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water,&#8221; but addeth, &#8220;in the name of a disciple&#8221; and so concludeth, &#8220;Verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1413"></A><A HREF="#fn_1413"><FONT SIZE="1">1414</FONT></A>
 The gift is to receive a prophet, to receive a righteous man, to hand a cup of cold water to a disciple; but the fruit is to do this in the name of a prophet, in the name of a righteous man, in the name of a disciple. With fruit was Elijah fed by the widow, who knew that she fed a man of God, and on this account fed him; but by the raven was he fed with a gift. Nor was the inner man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1414"></A><A HREF="#fn_1414"><FONT SIZE="1">1415</FONT></A>
 of Elijah fed, but the outer only, which might also from want of such food have perished.</p>
