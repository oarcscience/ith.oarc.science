Take a Wife, He Sought a Maiden that Was Pleasing Unto Him.</span>

<span id="vi.VI.XIII-p2"></span>23. Active efforts were made to get me a
wife. I wooed, I was engaged, my mother taking the greatest pains in the
matter, that when I was once married, the health-giving baptism might
cleanse me; for which she rejoiced that I was being daily fitted,
remarking that her desires and Thy promises were being fulfilled in my
faith. At which time, verily, both at my request and her own desire,
with strong heartfelt cries did we daily beg of Thee that Thou wouldest
by a vision disclose unto her something concerning my future marriage;
but Thou wouldest not. She saw indeed certain vain and fantastic things,
such as the earnestness of a human spirit, bent thereon, conjured up;
and these she told me of, not with her usual confidence when Thou hadst
shown her anything, but slighting them. For she could, she declared,
through some feeling which she could not express in words, discern the
difference betwixt Thy revelations and the dreams of her own spirit. Yet
the affair was pressed on, and a maiden sued who wanted two years of the
marriageable age; and, as she was pleasing, she was waited for.
