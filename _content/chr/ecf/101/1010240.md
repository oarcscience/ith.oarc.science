id="vi.XII.VII-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Out of Nothing God Made Heaven
and Earth.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.VII-p2"></span>7. And whence and in what manner was
this, unless from Thee, from whom are all things, in so far as they are?
But by how much the farther from Thee, so much the more unlike unto
Thee; for it is not distance of place. Thou, therefore, O Lord, who art
not one thing in one place, and otherwise in another, but the Self-same,
and the Self-same, and the Self-same, <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077) Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God
Almighty, didst in the beginning, <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078) which is of Thee, in Thy Wisdom,
which was born of Thy Substance, create something, and that out of
nothing. <span id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079) For Thou didst
create heaven and earth, not out of Thyself, for then they would be
equal to Thine Only-begotten, and thereby even to Thee; <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080) and in no wise would it be right
that anything should be equal to Thee which was not of Thee. And aught
else except Thee there was not whence Thou mightest create these things,
O God, One Trinity, and Trine Unity; and, therefore, out of nothing
didst Thou create heaven and earth,—a great thing and a small,because
Thou art Almighty and Good, to make all things good, even the great
heaven and the small earth. Thou wast, and there was nought else from
which Thou didst create heaven and earth; two such things, one near unto
Thee, the other near to nothing, <span
id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081) —one to which Thou shouldest be
superior, the other to which nothing should be inferior.

<span id="vi.XII.VII-p6"></span> In the beginning of sec. 10, book xi.
of his *De Civ. Dei*, he similarly argues that the world was, not like
the Son, “begotten of the simple good,” but “created.” See also note 8,
p. 76, above.
