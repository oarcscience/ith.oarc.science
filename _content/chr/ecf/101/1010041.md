<span id="vi.II_1.VI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.II_1.VI-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Why He Delighted in that Theft,
When All Things Which Under the Appearance of Good Invite to Vice are
True and Perfect in God Alone.</span>

<span id="vi.II_1.VI-p2"></span>12. What was it, then, that I, miserable
one, so doted on in thee, thou theft of mine, thou deed of darkness, in
that sixteenth year of my age? Beautiful thou wert not, since thou wert
theft. But art thou anything, that so I may argue the case with thee?
Those pears that we stole were fair to the sight, because they were Thy
creation, Thou fairest <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204) of all,
Creator of all, Thou good God—God, the highest good, and my true good.
Those pears truly were pleasant to the sight; but it was not for them
that my miserable soul lusted, for I had abundance of better, but those
I plucked simply that I might steal. For, having plucked them, I threw
them away, my sole gratification in them being my own sin, which I was
pleased to enjoy. For if any of these pears entered my mouth, the
sweetener of it was my sin in eating it. And now, O Lord my God, I ask
what it was in that theft of mine that caused me such delight; and
behold it hath no beauty in it—not such, I mean, as exists in justice
and wisdom; nor such as is in the mind, memory, senses, and animal life
of man; nor yet such as is the glory and beauty of the stars in their
courses; or the earth, or the sea, teeming with incipient life, to
replace, as it is born, that which decayeth; nor, indeed, that false and
shadowy beauty which pertaineth to deceptive vices.

<span id="vi.II_1.VI-p4"></span>13. For thus doth pride imitate high
estate, whereas Thou alone art God, high above all. And what does
ambition seek but honours and renown, whereas Thou alone art to be
honoured above all, and renowned for evermore? The cruelty of the
powerful wishes to be feared; but who is to be feared but God
only, <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205) out of whose power what
can be forced away or withdrawn—when, or where, or whither, or by whom?
The enticements of the wanton would fain be deemed love; and yet is
naught more enticing than Thy charity, nor is aught loved more
healthfully than that, Thy truth, bright and beautiful above all.
Curiosity affects a desire for knowledge, whereas it is Thou who
supremely knowest all things. Yea, ignorance and foolishness themselves
are concealed under the names of ingenuousness and harmlessness, because
nothing can be found more ingenuous than Thou; and what is more
harmless, since it is a sinner’s own works by which he is harmed? <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206) And sloth seems to long for rest; but
what sure rest is there besides the Lord? Luxury would fain be called
plenty and abundance; but Thou art the fulness and unfailing
plenteousness of unfading joys. Prodigality presents a shadow of
liberality; but Thou art the most lavish giver of all good. Covetousness
desires to possess much; and Thou art the Possessor of all things. Envy
contends for excellence; but what so excellent as Thou? Anger seeks
revenge; who avenges more justly than Thou? Fear starts at unwonted and
sudden chances which threaten things beloved, and is wary for their
security; but what can happen that is unwonted or sudden to Thee? or who
can deprive Thee of what Thou lovest? or where is there unshaken
security save with Thee? Grief languishes for things lost in which
desire had delighted itself, even because it would have nothing taken
from it, as nothing can be from Thee.

<span id="vi.II_1.VI-p7"></span>14. Thus doth the soul commit
fornication when she turns away from Thee, and seeks without Thee what
she cannot find pure and untainted until she returns to Thee. Thus all
pervertedly imitate Thee who separate themselves far from Thee <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207) and raise themselves up against Thee.
But even by thus imitating Thee they acknowledge Thee to be the Creator
of all nature, and so that there is no place whither they can altogether
retire from Thee. <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208) What, then,
was it that I loved in that theft? And wherein did I, even corruptedly
and pervertedly, imitate my Lord? Did I wish, if only by artifice, to
act contrary to Thy law, because by power I could not, so that, being a
captive, I might imitate an imperfect liberty by doing with impunity
things which I was not allowed to do, in obscured likeness of Thy
omnipotency? <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209) Behold this servant
of Thine, fleeing from his Lord, and following a shadow! <span
id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210) O rottenness! O monstrosity of life
and profundity of death! <span id="page_59">p. 59</span> <span
id="vi.II_1.VI-Page_59"></span>Could I like that which was unlawful only
because it was unlawful?
