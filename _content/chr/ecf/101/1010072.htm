<p class="c10"><a name="vi.IV.XIII-p2"></A>20. These things I knew not at that time, and I loved these lower beauties, and I was sinking to the very depths; and I said to my friends, &#8220;Do we love anything but the beautiful? What, then, is the beautiful? And what is beauty? What is it that allures and unites us to the things we love; for unless there were a grace and beauty in them, they could by no means attract us to them?&#8221; And I marked and perceived that in bodies themselves there was a beauty from their forming a kind of whole, and another from mutual fitness, as one part of the body with its whole, or a shoe with a foot, and so on. And this consideration sprang up in my mind out of the recesses of my heart, and I wrote books (two or three, I think) &#8220;on the fair and fit.&#8221; Thou knowest, O Lord, for it has escaped me; for I have them not, but they have strayed from me, I know not how.</p>
