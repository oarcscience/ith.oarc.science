id="vi.XI.IX-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Wisdom and the Beginning.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.IX-p2"></span>11. In this Beginning, O God, hast Thou
made heaven and earth,—in Thy Word, in Thy Son, in Thy Power, in Thy
Wisdom, in Thy Truth, wondrously speaking and wondrously making. Who
shall comprehend? who shall relate it? What is that which shines through
me, and strikes my heart without injury, and I both shudder and burn? I
shudder inasmuch as I am unlike it; and I burn inasmuch as I am like it.
It is Wisdom itself that shines through me, clearing my cloudiness,
which again overwhelms me, fainting from it, in the darkness and amount
of my punishment. For my strength is brought down in need, <span
id="fr_1034"></span>[1035](#fn_1034) so that I cannot endure my
blessings, until Thou, O Lord, who hast <span id="page_167">p.
167</span> <span id="vi.XI.IX-Page_167"></span>been gracious to all mine
iniquities, heal also all mine infirmities; because Thou shalt also
redeem my life from corruption, and crown me with Thy loving-kindness
and mercy, and shalt satisfy my desire with good things, because my
youth shall be renewed like the eagle’s. <span
id="fr_1035"></span>[1036](#fn_1035) For by hope we are saved; and
through patience we await Thy promises. <span
id="fr_1036"></span>[1037](#fn_1036) Let him that is able hear Thee
discoursing within. I will with confidence cry out from Thy oracle, How
wonderful are Thy works, O Lord, in Wisdom hast Thou made them
all. <span id="fr_1037"></span>[1038](#fn_1037) And this Wisdom is the
Beginning, and in that Beginning hast Thou made heaven and earth.
