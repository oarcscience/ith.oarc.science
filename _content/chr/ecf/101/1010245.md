id="vi.XII.XII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—From the Formless Earth God
Created Another Heaven and a Visible and Formed Earth.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.XII-p2"></span>15. Which things considered as much as
Thou givest, O my God, as much as Thou excitest me to “knock,” and as
much as Thou openest unto me when I knock, <span
id="fr_1098"></span>[1099](#fn_1098) two things I find which Thou hast
made, not within the compass of time, since neither is co-eternal with
Thee. One, which is so formed that, without any failing of
contemplation, without any interval of change, although changeable, yet
not changed, it may fully enjoy Thy eternity and unchangeableness; the
other, which was so formless, that it had not that by which it could be
changed from one form into another, either of motion or of repose,
whereby it might be subject unto time. But this Thou didst not leave to
be formless, since before all days, in the beginning Thou createdst
heaven and earth,—these two things of which I spoke. But the earth was
invisible and without form, and darkness was upon the deep. <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099) By which words its shapelessness is
conveyed unto us, that by degrees those minds may be drawn on which
cannot wholly conceive the privation of all form without coming to
nothing,—whence another heaven might be created, and another earth
visible and well-formed, and water beautifully ordered, and whatever
besides is, in the formation of this world, recorded to have been, not
without days, created; because such things are so that in them the
vicissitudes of times may take place, on account of the appointed
changes of motions and of forms. <span
