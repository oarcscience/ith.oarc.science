<span id="vi.I_1.I-p2"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.I_1.I-p2.1"></span>Chapter I.—He Proclaims the Greatness of God,
Whom He Desires to Seek and Invoke, Being Awakened by Him.</span>

<span id="vi.I_1.I-p3"></span>1. <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.I_1.I-p3.1"></span>Great</span> art Thou, O Lord, and greatly to
be praised; great is Thy power, and of Thy wisdom there is no end. <span
id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120) And man, being a part of Thy creation,
desires to praise Thee, man, who bears about with him his mortality, the
witness of his sin, even the witness that Thou “resistest the
proud,” <span id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121) —yet man, this part of
Thy creation, desires to praise Thee. <span
id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122) Thou movest us to delight in praising
Thee; for Thou hast formed us for Thyself, and our hearts are restless
till they find rest in Thee. <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123)
Lord, teach me to know and understand which of these should be first, to
call on Thee, or to praise Thee; and likewise to know Thee, or to call
upon Thee. But who is there that calls upon Thee without knowing Thee?
For he that knows Thee not may call upon Thee as other than Thou art. Or
perhaps we call on Thee that we may know Thee. “But how shall they call
on Him in whom they have not believed? or how shall they believe without
a preacher?” <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124) And those who seek
the Lord shall praise Him. <span id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125) For
those who seek shall find Him, <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126)
and those who find Him shall praise Him. Let me seek Thee, Lord, in
calling on Thee, and call on Thee in believing in Thee; for Thou hast
been preached unto us. O Lord, my faith calls on Thee,—that faith which
Thou hast imparted to me, which Thou hast breathed into me through the
incarnation of Thy Son, through the ministry of Thy preacher. <span

<span id="vi.I_1.I-p6"></span>Augustin begins with praise, and the whole
book vibrates with praise. He says elsewhere (in [Ps.
cxlix.](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#000)<span
id="vi.I_1.I-p6.1"></span>), that “as a new song fits not well an old
man’s lips, he should sing a new song who is a new creature and is
living a new life;” and so from the time of his new birth, the “new
song” of praise went up from him, and that “not of the lip only,” but
(ibid. cxlviii.) *conscientia lingua vita*.

id="vi.I_1.I-p6.2"></span>

<span id="vi.I_1.I-p7"></span>And the rest which the Christian has here
is but an earnest of the more perfect rest hereafter, when, as Augustin
says (*De Gen. ad. Lit.*. xii. 26), “all virtue will be to love what one
sees, and the highest felicity to have what one loves.” \[Watts,
followed by Pusey, and Shedd, missed the paronomasia of the Latin: “cor
nostrum *inquietum* est donec *requiescat* in Te,” by translating: “our
heart is *restless*, until it *repose* in Thee.” It is the finest
sentence in the whole book, and furnishes one of the best arguments for
Christianity as the only religion which leads to that rest in God.—P.
S.\]

<span id="vi.I_1.I-p11"></span> That is, Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, who
was instrumental in his conversion (vi. sec. 1; viii. sec. 28, etc.).
“Before conversion,” as Leighton observes on [1 Pet.
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002)<span id="vi.I_1.I-p11.1"></span>,
“wit or eloquence may draw a man to the word, and possibly prove a happy
bait to catch him (as St. Augustin reports of his hearing St. Ambrose),
but, once born again, then it is the milk itself that he desires for
itself.”
