id="vi.VIII.III-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—That God and the Angels
Rejoice More on the Return of One Sinner Than of Many Just
Persons.</span>

<span id="vi.VIII.III-p2"></span>6. Good God, what passed in man to make
him rejoice more at the salvation of a soul despaired of, and delivered
from greater danger, than if there had always been hope of him, or the
danger had been less? For so Thou also, O merciful Father, dost “joy
over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just
persons that need no repentance.” And with much joyfulness do we hear,
whenever we hear, how the lost sheep is brought home again on the
Shepherd’s shoulders, while the angels rejoice, and the drachma is
restored to Thy treasury, the neighhours rejoicing with the woman who
found it; <span id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624) and the joy of the
solemn service of Thy house constraineth to tears, when in Thy house it
is read of Thy younger son that he “was dead, and is alive again, and
was lost, and is found.” <span id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625) For
Thou rejoicest both in us and in Thy angels, holy through holy charity.
For Thou art ever the same; for all things which abide neither the same
nor for ever, Thou ever knowest after the same manner.

<span id="vi.VIII.III-p5"></span>7. What, then, passes in the soul when
it more delights at finding or having restored to it the thing it loves
than if it had always possessed them? Yea, and other things bear witness
hereunto; and all things are full of witnesses, crying out, “So it is.”
The victorious commander triumpheth; yet he would not have conquered had
he not fought, and the greater the peril of the battle, the more the
rejoicing of the triumph. The storm tosses the voyagers, threatens
shipwreck, and every one waxes pale at the approach of death; but sky
and sea grow calm, and they rejoice much, as they feared much. A loved
one is sick, and his pulse indicates danger; all who desire his safety
are at once sick at heart: he recovers, though not able as yet to walk
with his former strength, and there is such joy as was not before when
he walked sound and strong. Yea, the very pleasures of human life—not
those only which rush upon us unexpectedly, and against our wills, but
those that are voluntary and designed—do men obtain by difficulties.
There is no pleasure at all in eating and drinking unless the pains of
hunger and thirst go before. And drunkards eat certain salt meats with
the view of creating a troublesome heat, which the drink allaying causes
pleasure. It is also the custom that the affianced bride should not
immediately be given up, that the husband may not less esteem her whom,
as betrothed, he longed not for. <span id="fr_626"></span>[627](#fn_626)

<span id="vi.VIII.III-p7"></span>8. This law obtains in base and
accursed joy; in that joy also which is permitted and lawful; in the
sincerity of honest friendship; and in Him who was dead, and lived
again, had been lost, and was found. <span
id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627) The greater joy is everywhere preceded
by the greater pain. What meaneth this, O Lord my God, when Thou art, an
everlasting joy unto Thine own self, and some things about Thee are ever
rejoicing in Thee? <span id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628) What meaneth
this, that this portion of things thus ebbs and flows, alternately
offended and reconciled? Is this the fashion of them, and is this all
Thou hast allotted to them, whereas from the highest heaven to the
lowest earth, from the beginning of the world to its end, from the angel
to the worm, from the first movement unto the last, Thou settedst each
in its right place, and appointedst each its proper seasons, everything
good after its kind? Woe is me! How high art Thou in the highest, and
how deep in the deepest! Thou withdrawest no whither, and scarcely do we
*return* to Thee.
