<p class="c10"><a name="vi.XIII.XXVIII-p2"></A>43. And Thou, O God, sawest everything that Thou hadst made, and behold it was very good.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1416"></A><A HREF="#fn_1416"><FONT SIZE="1">1417</FONT></A>
 So we also see the same, and behold all are very good. In each particular kind of Thy works, when Thou hadst said, &#8220;Let them be made,&#8221; and they were made, Thou sawest that it was good. Seven times have I counted it written that Thou sawest that that which Thou madest was &#8220;good;&#8221; and this is the eighth, that Thou sawest all things that Thou hadst made, and behold they are not only good, but also &#8220;very good,&#8221; as being now taken together. For individually they were only good, but all taken together they were both good and very good. All beautiful bodies also express this; for a body which consists of members, all of which are beautiful, is by far more beautiful than the several members individually are by whose well-ordered union the whole is completed, though these members also be severally beautiful.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1417"></A><A HREF="#fn_1417"><FONT SIZE="1">1418</FONT></A>
