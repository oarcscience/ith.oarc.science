<p class="c41"><a name="vi.XII.XXXI-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="vi.XII.XXXI-p1.1"></A>Chapter XXXI.&#8212;Moses is Supposed to Have Perceived Whatever of Truth Can Be Discovered in His Words.</span></p>  
<p class="c50"><a name="vi.XII.XXXI-p2"></A>42. Thus, when one shall say, &#8220;He [Moses] meant as I do,&#8221; and another, &#8220;Nay, but as I do,&#8221; I suppose that I am speaking more religiously when I say, &#8220;Why not rather as both, if both be true?&#8221; And if there be a third truth, or a fourth, and if any one seek any truth altogether different in those words, why may not he be believed to have seen all these, through whom one God hath tempered the Holy Scriptures to the senses of many, about to see therein things true but different? I certainly,&#8212;and I fearlessly declare it from my heart,&#8212;were I to write anything to have the highest authority, should prefer so to write, that whatever of truth any one might apprehend concerning these matters, my words should re-echo, rather than that I should set down one true opinion so clearly on this as that I should exclude the rest, that which was false in which could not offend me. Therefore am I unwilling, O my God, to be so headstrong as not to believe that from Thee this man [Moses] hath received so much. He, surely, when he wrote those words, perceived and thought whatever of truth we have been able to discover, yea, and whatever we have not been able, nor yet are able, though still it may be found in them.</p>
