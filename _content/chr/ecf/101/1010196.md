While Pleasing Themselves, Displease God.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XXXIX-p2"></span>64. Within also, within is another evil,
arising out of the same kind of temptation; whereby they become empty
who please themselves in themselves, although they please not, or
displease, or aim at pleasing others. But in pleasing themselves, they
much displease Thee, not merely taking pleasure in things not good as if
they were good, but in Thy good things as though they were their own; or
even as if in Thine, yet as though of their own merits; or even as if
though of Thy grace, yet not with friendly rejoicings, but as envying
that grace to others. <span id="fr_964"></span>[965](#fn_964) In all
these and similar perils and labours Thou perceivest the trembling of my
heart, and I rather feel my wounds to be cured by Thee than not
inflicted by me.

compares the truly pious man, who attributes all his good to God’s
mercy, “giving thanks for what in him is healed, and pouring out prayers
for the healing of that which is yet unhealed,” with the philosophers
who make their chief end pleasure or human glory.
