id="vi.VII.XVI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Evil Arises Not from a
Substance, But from the Perversion of the Will.</span>

<span id="vi.VII.XVI-p2"></span>22. And I discerned and found it no
marvel, that bread which is distasteful to an unhealthy palate is
pleasant to a healthy one; and that the light, which is painful to sore
eyes, is delightful to sound ones. And Thy righteousness displeaseth the
wicked; much more the viper and little worm, which Thou hast created
good, fitting in with inferior parts of Thy creation; with which the
wicked themselves also fit in, the more in proportion as they are unlike
Thee, but with the superior creatures, in proportion as they become like
to Thee. <span id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542) And I inquired what
iniquity was, and ascertained it not to be a substance, but a perversion
of the will, bent aside from Thee, O God, the Supreme Substance, towards
these lower things, and casting out its bowels, <span

Apocrypha (*De Mus*. vi. 40), he says, that while the soul’s happiness
and life is in God, “what is to go into outer things, but to cast out
its *inward parts*, that is, to place itself far from God—not by
distance of place, but by the affection of the mind?”
