<span id="vii.1.CLXIII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span

<span id="vii.1.CLXIII-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CLXIII-p3.1"></span>To Bishop Augustin, Bishop Evodius Sends
Greeting.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CLXIII-p4"></span>Some time ago I sent two questions to
your Holiness; the first, which was sent, I think, by Jobinus, a servant
in the nunnery, <span id="fr_2671"></span>[2672](#fn_2671) related to
God and reason, and the second was in regard to the opinion that the
body of the Saviour is capable of seeing the substance of the Deity. I
now propound a third question: Does the rational soul which our Saviour
assumed along with His body fall under any one of the theories commonly
advanced in discussions on the origin of souls (if any theory indeed can
be with certainty established on the subject),—or does His soul, though
rational, belong not to any of the species under which the souls of
living creatures are classified, but to another?

<span id="vii.1.CLXIII-p6"></span>I ask also a fourth question: Who are
those spirits in reference to whom the Apostle Peter testifies
concerning the Lord in these words: “Being put to death in the flesh,
but quickened in the spirit, in which also He went and preached to the
spirits in prison?” giving us to understand that they were in hell, and
that Christ descending into hell, preached the gospel to them all, and
by grace delivered them all from darkness and punishment, so that from
the time of the resurrection of the Lord judgment is expected, hell
having then been completely emptied.

<span id="vii.1.CLXIII-p7"></span>What your Holiness believes in this
matter I earnestly desire to know.
