id="vi.X.XXV-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—He is Glad that God Dwells in His
Memory.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XXV-p2"></span>36. But where in my memory abidest Thou, O
Lord, where dost Thou there abide? What manner of chamber hast Thou
there formed for Thyself? What sort of sanctuary hast Thou erected for
Thyself? Thou hast granted this honour to my memory, to take up Thy
abode in it; but in what quarter of it Thou abidest, I am considering.
For in calling Thee to mind, <span id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870) I
soared beyond those parts of it which the beasts also possess, since I
found Thee not there amongst the images of corporeal things; and I
arrived at those parts where I had committed the affections of my mind,
nor there did I find Thee. And I entered into the very seat of my mind,
which it has in my memory, since the mind remembers itself also—nor wert
Thou there. For as Thou art not a bodily image, nor the affection of a
living creature, as when we rejoice, condole, desire, fear, remember,
forget, or aught of the kind; so neither art Thou the mind itself,
because Thou art the Lord God of the mind; and all these things are
changed, but Thou remainest unchangeable over all, yet vouchsafest to
dwell in my memory, from the time I learned Thee. But why do I now seek
in what part of it Thou dwellest, as if truly there were places in it?
Thou dost dwell in it assuredly, since I have remembered Thee from the
time I learned Thee, and I find Thee in it when I call Thee to mind.
