### <span id="ix.iii.xxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—Souls can be recognised in the separate state, and are immortal although they once had a beginning.

<span id="ix.iii.xxxv-p1"></span>1. The Lord has taught with very great
fulness, that souls not only continue to exist, not by passing from body
to body, but that they preserve the same form <span
id="fr_3286"></span>[3287](#fn_3286) \[in their separate state\] as the
body had to which they were adapted, and that they remember the deeds
which they did in this state of existence, and from which they have now
ceased,—in that narrative which is recorded respecting the rich man and
that Lazarus who found repose in the bosom of Abraham. In this account
He states <span id="fr_3287"></span>[3288](#fn_3287) that Dives knew
Lazarus after death, and Abraham in like manner, and that each one of
these persons continued in his own proper position, and that \[Dives\]
requested Lazarus to be sent to relieve him—\[Lazarus\], on whom he did
not \[formerly\] bestow even the crumbs \[which fell\] from his table.
\[He tells us\] also of the answer given by Abraham, who was acquainted
not only with what respected himself, but Dives also, and who enjoined
those who did not wish to come into that place of torment to believe
Moses and the prophets, and to receive <span
id="fr_3288"></span>[3289](#fn_3288) the preaching of Him who was <span
id="fr_3289"></span>[3290](#fn_3289) to rise again from the dead. By
these things, then, it is plainly declared that souls continue to exist
that they do not pass from body to body, that they possess the form of a
man, so that they may be recognised, and retain the memory of things in
this world; moreover, that the gift of prophecy was possessed by
Abraham, and that each class \[of souls\] receives a habitation such as
it has deserved, even before the judgment.

<span id="ix.iii.xxxv-p6"></span>2. But if any persons at this point
maintain that those souls, which only began a little while ago to exist,
cannot endure for any length of time; but that they must, on the one
hand, either be unborn, in order that they may be immortal, or if they
have had a beginning in the way of generation, that they should die with
the body itself—let them learn that God alone, who is Lord of all, is
without beginning and without end, being truly and for ever the same,
and always remaining the same unchangeable Being. But all things which
proceed from Him, whatsoever have been made, and are made, do indeed
receive their own beginning of generation, and on this account are
inferior to Him who formed them, inasmuch as they are not unbegotten.
Nevertheless they endure, and extend their existence into a long series
of ages in accordance with the will of God their Creator; so that He
grants them that they should be thus formed at the beginning, and that
they should so exist afterwards.

<span id="ix.iii.xxxv-p7"></span>3. For as the heaven which is above us,
the firmament, the sun, the moon, the rest of the stars, and all their
grandeur, although they had no previous existence, were called into
being, and continue throughout a long course of time according to the
will of God, so also any one who thinks thus respecting souls and
spirits, and, in fact, respecting all created things, will not by any
means go far astray, inasmuch as all things that have been made had a
beginning when they were formed, but endure as long as God wills that
they should have an existence and continuance. The prophetic Spirit
bears testimony to these opinions, when He declares, “For He spake, and
they were made; He commanded, and they were created: He hath established
them for ever, yea, forever and ever.” <span
id="fr_3290"></span>[3291](#fn_3290) And again, He thus speaks
respecting the salvation of man: “He asked life of Thee, and Thou gavest
him length of days for ever and ever;” <span
id="fr_3291"></span>[3292](#fn_3291) indicating that it is the Father of
all who imparts continuance for ever and ever on those who are saved.
For life does not arise from us, nor from our own nature; but it is
bestowed according to the grace of God. And therefore he who shall
preserve the life bestowed upon him, and give thanks to Him who imparted
it, shall receive also length of days for ever and ever. But he who
shall reject it, and prove himself ungrateful to his Maker, inasmuch as
he has been created, and has not recognised Him who <span
id="page_412">p. 412</span> <span id="ix.iii.xxxv-Page_412"></span>
bestowed \[the gift upon him\], deprives himself of \[the privilege of\]
continuance for ever and ever. <span
id="fr_3292"></span>[3293](#fn_3292) And, for this reason, the Lord
declared to those who showed themselves ungrateful towards Him: “If ye
have not been faithful in that which is little, who will give you that
which is great?” <span id="fr_3293"></span>[3294](#fn_3293) indicating
that those who, in this brief temporal life, have shown themselves
ungrateful to Him who bestowed it, shall justly not receive from Him
length of days for ever and ever.

<span id="ix.iii.xxxv-p12"></span>4. But as the animal body is certainly
not itself the soul, yet has fellowship with the soul as long as God
pleases; so the soul herself is not life, <span
id="fr_3294"></span>[3295](#fn_3294) but partakes in that life bestowed
upon her by God. Wherefore also the prophetic word declares of the
first-formed man, “He became a living soul,” <span
id="fr_3295"></span>[3296](#fn_3295) teaching us that by the
participation of life the soul became alive; so that the soul, and the
life which it possesses, must be understood as being separate
existences. When God therefore bestows life and perpetual duration, it
comes to pass that even souls which did not previously exist should
henceforth endure \[for ever\], since God has both willed that they
should exist, and should continue in existence. For the will of God
ought to govern and rule in all things, while all other things give way
to Him, are in subjection, and devoted to His service. Thus far, then,
let me speak concerning the creation and the continued duration of the
soul.

<span id="ix.iii.xxxv-p2"></span> Grabe refers to Tertullian, *De
Anima*, ch. vii., as making a similar statement. Massuet, on the other
hand, denies that Irenæus here expresses an opinion like that of
Tertullian in the passage referred to, and thinks that the special form
(*character*) mentioned is to be understood as simply denoting
individual *spiritual* properties. But his remarks are not satisfactory.

is to be understood in harmony with the repeated assertion of Irenæus
that the wicked will exist in misery for ever. It refers not
annihilation, but to deprivation of happiness.
