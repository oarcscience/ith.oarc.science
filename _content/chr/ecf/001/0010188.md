### <span id="v.vi.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Praise of the bishop.

<span id="v.vi.i-p1"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.vi.i-p1.1"></span>Which</span> bishop, <span
id="fr_883"></span>[884](#fn_883) I know, obtained the ministry which
pertains to the common \[weal\], not of himself, neither by men, <span
id="fr_884"></span>[885](#fn_884) nor through vainglory, but by the love
of God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ; at whose meekness I am
struck with admiration, and who by his silence is able to accomplish
more than those who vainly talk. For he is in harmony with the
commandments \[of God\], even as the harp is with its strings. Wherefore
my soul declares his mind towards God a happy one, knowing it to be
virtuous and perfect, and that his stability as well as freedom from all
anger is after the example of the infinite <span
id="fr_885"></span>[886](#fn_885) meekness of the living God.

<span id="v.vi.i-p5"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.vi.i-p5.1"></span>Having</span> beheld your bishop, I know that he
was not selected to undertake the ministry which pertains to the common
\[weal\], either by himself or by men, <span
id="fr_886"></span>[887](#fn_886) or out of vainglory, but by the love
of Jesus Christ, and of God the Father, who raised Him from the dead; at
whose meekness I am struck with admiration, and who by His silence is
able to accomplish more than they who talk a great deal. For he is in
harmony with the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, even as the
strings are with the harp, and is no less blameless than was Zacharias
the priest. <span id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887) Wherefore my soul
declares his mind towards God a happy one, knowing it to be virtuous and
perfect, and that his stability as well as freedom from all anger is
after the example of the infinite meekness of the living God.
