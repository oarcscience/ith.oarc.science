<p><a name="ix.viii.iii-p1"></A><a name="ix.viii.iii-p1.1"></A>For&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4799"></A><A HREF="#fn_4799"><FONT SIZE="1">4800</FONT></A>
 the controversy is not merely as regards the day, but also as regards the form itself of the fast.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4800"></A><A HREF="#fn_4800"><FONT SIZE="1">4801</FONT></A>
 For some consider themselves bound to fast one day, others two days, others still more, while others [do so during] forty: the diurnal and the nocturnal hours they measure out together as their [fasting] day.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4801"></A><A HREF="#fn_4801"><FONT SIZE="1">4802</FONT></A>
 And this variety among the observers [of the fasts] had not its origin in our time, but long before in that of our predecessors, some of whom probably, being not very accurate in their observance of it,  <A NAME="page_569"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 569</FONT></A> <a name="ix.viii.iii-Page_569"></A>  handed down to posterity the custom as it had, through simplicity or private fancy, been [introduced among them]. And yet nevertheless all these lived in peace one with another, and we also keep peace together. Thus, in fact, the difference [in observing] the fast establishes the harmony of [our common] faith.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4802"></A><A HREF="#fn_4802"><FONT SIZE="1">4803</FONT></A>
 And the presbyters preceding Soter in the government of the Church which thou dost now rule&#8212;I mean, Anicetus and Pius, Hyginus and Telesphorus, and Sixtus&#8212;did neither themselves observe it [after that fashion], nor permit those with them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4803"></A><A HREF="#fn_4803"><FONT SIZE="1">4804</FONT></A>
 to do so. Notwithstanding this, those who did not keep [the feast in this way] were peacefully disposed towards those who came to them from other dioceses in which it was [so] observed although such observance was [felt] in more decided contrariety [as presented] to those who did not fall in with it; and none were ever cast out [of the Church] for this matter. On the contrary, those presbyters who preceded thee, and who did not observe [this custom], sent the Eucharist to those of other dioceses who did observe it.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4804"></A><A HREF="#fn_4804"><FONT SIZE="1">4805</FONT></A>
 And when the blessed Polycarp was sojourning in Rome in the time of Anicetus, although a slight controversy had arisen among them as to certain other points, they were at once well inclined towards each other [with regard to the matter in hand], not willing that any quarrel should arise between them upon this head. For neither could Anicetus persuade Polycarp to forego the observance [in his own way], inasmuch as these things had been always [so] observed by John the disciple of our Lord, and by other apostles with whom he had been conversant; nor, on the other hand, could Polycarp succeed in persuading Anicetus to keep [the observance in his way], for he maintained that he was bound to adhere to the usage of the presbyters who preceded him. And in this state of affairs they held fellowship with each other; and Anicetus conceded to Polycarp in the Church the celebration of the Eucharist, by way of showing him respect; so that they parted in peace one from the other, maintaining peace with the whole Church, both those who did observe [this custom] and those who did not.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4805"></A><A HREF="#fn_4805"><FONT SIZE="1">4806</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.viii.iii-p2"></A> See pp. 31 and 312, of this volume. We are indebted again to Eusebius for this valuable fragment from the Epistle of Iren&aelig;us to Victor Bishop of Rome (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i>, v. 24; copied also by Nicephorus, iv. 39). It appears to have been a synodical epistle to the head of the Roman Church, the historian saying that it was written by Iren&aelig;us, &#8220;in the name of (<span class="Greek"><a name="ix.viii.iii-p2.1"></A>&#7952;&#954; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#965;</span>) those brethren over whom he ruled throughout Gaul.&#8221; Neither are these expressions to be limited to the Church at Lyons, for the same authority records (v. 23) that it was the testimony &#8220;of the dioceses throughout Gaul, which Iren&aelig;us superintended&#8221; (Harvey).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.viii.iii-p3"></A> According to Harvey, the early paschal controversy resolved itself into two particulars: (<i>a</i>) as regards the precise day on which our Lord&#146;s resurrection should be celebrated; (<i>b</i>) as regards the custom of the feast preceding it.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.viii.iii-p4"></A> Both reading and punctuation are here subjects of controversy. We have followed Massuet and Harvey.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.viii.iii-p5"></A> &#8220;The observance of <i>a</i> day, though not everywhere the same, showed unity, so far as faith in the Lord&#146;s resurrection was concerned.&#8221;&#8212;<span class="upper"><a name="ix.viii.iii-p5.1"></A>Harvey</span>.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.viii.iii-p6"></A> Following the reading of Rufinus, the ordinary text has <span class="Greek"><a name="ix.viii.iii-p6.1"></A>&#956;&#949;&#964;&#146; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8059;&#962;</span>, i.e., after them.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.viii.iii-p7"></A> This practice was afterwards forbidden by the Council of Laodicea [held about <span class="upper"><a name="ix.viii.iii-p7.1"></A>a.d.</span> 360].</p> 
<A NAME="fn_4805"></A><A HREF="0010878.htm#fr_4805">569:4806</A> <a name="ix.viii.iii-p7.2"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.viii.iii-p8"></A> It was perhaps in reference to this pleasing episode in the annals of the Church, that the Council of Arles, <span class="upper"><a name="ix.viii.iii-p8.1"></A>a.d.</span> 314, decreed that the holy Eucharist should be consecrated by any foreign bishop present at its celebration.</p>
