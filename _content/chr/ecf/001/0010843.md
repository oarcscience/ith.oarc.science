### <span id="ix.vii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—The prolonged life of the ancients, the translation of Elijah and of Enoch in their own bodies, as well as the preservation of Jonah, of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the midst of extreme peril, are clear demonstrations that God can raise up our bodies to life eternal.

<span id="ix.vii.vi-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vii.vi-p1.1"></span>\[In
order to learn\] that bodies did continue in existence for a lengthened
period, as long as it was God’s good pleasure that they should flourish,
let \[these heretics\] read the Scriptures, and they will find that our
predecessors advanced beyond seven hundred, eight hundred, and nine
hundred years of age; and that their bodies kept pace with the
protracted length of their days, and participated in life as long as God
willed that they should live. But why do I refer to these men? <span
id="ix.vii.vi-p1.2"></span><span id="ix.vii.vi-p1.3"></span>For Enoch,
when he pleased God, was translated in the same body in which he did
please Him, thus pointing out by anticipation the translation of the
just. <span id="ix.vii.vi-p1.4"></span>Elijah, too, was caught up \[when
he was yet\] in the substance of the \[natural\] form; thus exhibiting
in prophecy the <span id="page_531">p. 531</span> <span
id="ix.vii.vi-Page_531"></span> assumption of those who are spiritual,
and that nothing stood in the way of their body being translated and
caught up. For by means of the very same hands through which they were
moulded at the beginning, did they receive this translation and
assumption. For in Adam the hands of God had become accustomed to set in
order, to rule, and to sustain His own workmanship, and to bring it and
place it where they pleased. <span id="ix.vii.vi-p1.5"></span>Where,
then, was the first man placed? In paradise certainly, as the Scripture
declares “And God planted a garden \[*paradisum*\] eastward in Eden, and
there He placed the man whom He had formed.” <span
id="fr_4470"></span>[4471](#fn_4470) And then afterwards when \[man\]
proved disobedient, he was cast out thence into this world. Wherefore
also the elders who were disciples of the apostles tell us that those
who were translated were transferred to that place (for paradise has
been prepared for righteous men, such as have the Spirit; in which place
also Paul the apostle, when he was caught up, heard words which are
unspeakable as regards us in our present condition <span
id="fr_4471"></span>[4472](#fn_4471) ), and that there shall they who
have been translated remain until the consummation \[of all things\], as
a prelude to immortality.

<span id="ix.vii.vi-p4"></span>2. If, however, any one imagine it
impossible that men should survive for such a length of time, and that
Elias was not caught up in the flesh, but that his flesh was consumed in
the fiery chariot, let him consider that Jonah, when he had been cast
into the deep, and swallowed down into the whale’s belly, was by the
command of God again thrown out safe upon the land. <span
id="fr_4472"></span>[4473](#fn_4472) <span
id="ix.vii.vi-p5.2"></span>And then, again, when Ananias, Azarias, and
Misaël were cast into the furnace of fire sevenfold heated, they
sustained no harm whatever, neither was the smell of fire perceived upon
them. As, therefore, the hand of God was present with them, working out
marvellous things in their case—\[things\] impossible \[to be
accomplished\] by man’s nature—what wonder was it, if also in the case
of those who were translated it performed something wonderful, working
in obedience to the will of God, even the Father? Now this is the Son of
God, as the Scripture represents Nebuchadnezzar the king as having said,
“Did not we cast three men bound into the furnace? and, lo, I do see
four walking in the midst of the fire, and the fourth is like the Son of
God.” <span id="fr_4473"></span>[4474](#fn_4473) Neither the nature of
any created thing, therefore, nor the weakness of the flesh, can prevail
against the will of God. For God is not subject to created things, but
created things to God; and all things yield obedience to His will.
Wherefore also the Lord declares, “The things which are impossible with
men, are possible with God.” <span id="fr_4474"></span>[4475](#fn_4474)
As, therefore, it might seem to the men of the present day, who are
ignorant of God’s appointment, to be a thing incredible and impossible
that any man could live for such a number of years, yet those who were
before us did live \[to such an age\], and those who were translated do
live as an earnest of the future length of days; and \[as it might also
appear impossible\] that from the whale’s belly and from the fiery
furnace men issued forth unhurt, yet they nevertheless did so, led forth
as it were by the hand of God, for the purpose of declaring His power:
so also now, although some, not knowing the power and promise of God,
may oppose their own salvation, deeming it impossible for God, who
raises up the dead; to have power to confer upon them eternal duration,
yet the scepticism of men of this stamp shall not render the
faithfulness of God of none effect.
