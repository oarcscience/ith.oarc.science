### <span id="viii.xi.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Rusticus threatens the Christians with death.

<span id="viii.xi.iv-p1"></span>The prefect says to Justin, “Hearken,
you who are called learned, and think that you know true doctrines; if
you are scourged and beheaded, do you believe you will ascend into
heaven?” Justin said, “I hope that, if I endure these things, I shall
have His gifts. <span id="fr_2645"></span>[2646](#fn_2645) For I know
that, to all who have thus lived, there abides the divine favour until
the completion of the whole world.” Rusticus the prefect said, “Do you
suppose, then, that you will ascend into heaven to receive some
recompense?” Justin said, “I do not suppose it, but I know and am fully
persuaded of it.” Rusticus the prefect said, “Let us, then, now come to
the matter in hand, and which presses. Having come together, offer
sacrifice with one accord to the gods.” Justin said, “No right-thinking
person falls away from piety to impiety.” Rusticus the prefect said,
“Unless ye obey, ye shall be mercilessly punished.” Justin said,
“Through prayer we can be saved on account of our Lord Jesus Christ,
even when we have been punished, <span
id="fr_2646"></span>[2647](#fn_2646) because this shall become to us
salvation and confidence at the more fearful and universal judgment-seat
of our Lord and Saviour.” Thus also said the other martyrs: “Do what you
will, for we are Christians, and do not sacrifice to idols.”

<span id="viii.xi.iv-p2"></span> Another reading is <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.xi.iv-p2.1"></span>δόγματα</span>, which
may be translated, “I shall have what He teaches \[us to expect\].”

<span id="fn_2646"></span>[306:2647](0010692.htm#fr_2646) <span
id="viii.xi.iv-p2.2"></span>

<span id="viii.xi.iv-p3"></span> This passage admits of another
rendering. Lord Hailes, following the common Latin version, thus
translates: “It was our chief wish to endure tortures for the sake of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and so to be saved.”
