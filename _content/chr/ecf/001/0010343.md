<span id="vi.ii.vii"></span>

### <span id="vi.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Fasting, and the goat sent away, were types of Christ.

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p1"></span><span
id="vi.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>Understand, then, ye children of gladness,
that the good Lord has foreshown all things to us, that we might know to
whom we ought for everything to render thanksgiving and praise. If
therefore the Son of God, who is Lord \[of all things\], and who will
judge the living and the dead, suffered, that His stroke might give us
life, let us believe that the Son of God could not have suffered except
for our sakes. Moreover, when fixed to the cross, He had given Him to
drink vinegar and gall. Hearken how the priests of the people <span
id="fr_1526"></span>[1527](#fn_1526) gave previous indications of this.
His commandment having been written, the Lord enjoined, that whosoever
did not keep the fast should be put to death, because He also Himself
was to offer in sacrifice for our sins the vessel of the Spirit, in
order that the type established in Isaac when he was offered upon the
altar might be fully accomplished. What, then, says He in the prophet?
“And let them eat of the goat which is offered, with fasting, for all
their sins.” <span id="fr_1527"></span>[1528](#fn_1527) Attend
carefully: “And let all the priests alone eat the inwards, unwashed with
vinegar.” Wherefore? Because to me, who am to offer my flesh for the
sins of my new people, ye are to give gall with vinegar to drink: eat ye
alone, while the people fast and mourn in sackcloth and ashes. \[These
things were done\] that He might show that it was necessary for Him to
suffer for them. <span id="fr_1528"></span>[1529](#fn_1528) How, <span
id="fr_1529"></span>[1530](#fn_1529) then, ran the commandment? <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p5.1"></span>Give your attention. Take two goats of goodly
aspect, and similar to each other, and offer them. And let the priest
take one as a burnt-offering for sins. <span
id="fr_1530"></span>[1531](#fn_1530) And what should they do with the
other? “Accursed,” says He, “is the one.” Mark how the type of
Jesus <span id="fr_1531"></span>[1532](#fn_1531) now comes out. “And all
of you spit upon it, and pierce it, and encircle its head with scarlet
wool, and thus let it be driven into the wilderness.” And when all this
has been done, he who bears the goat brings it into the desert, and
takes the wool off from it, and places that upon a shrub which is called
*Rachia*, <span id="fr_1532"></span>[1533](#fn_1532) of which also we
are accustomed to eat the fruits <span
id="fr_1533"></span>[1534](#fn_1533) when we find them in the field. Of
this <span id="fr_1534"></span>[1535](#fn_1534) kind of shrub alone the
fruits are sweet. Why then, again, is this? Give good heed. \[You see\]
“one upon the altar, and the other accursed;” and why \[do you behold\]
the one that is accursed crowned? Because they shall see Him then in
that day having a scarlet robe about his body down to his feet; and they
shall say, Is not this He whom we once despised, and pierced, and
mocked, and crucified? Truly this is <span
id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535) He who then declared Himself to be
the Son of God. For how like is He to Him! <span
id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536) With a view to this, \[He
required\] the goats to be of goodly aspect, and similar, that, when
they see Him then coming, they may be amazed by the likeness of the
goat. Behold, then, <span id="fr_1537"></span>[1538](#fn_1537) the type
of Jesus who was to suffer. But why is it that they <span
id="page_142">p. 142</span> <span id="vi.ii.vii-Page_142"></span> place
the wool in the midst of thorns? It is a type of Jesus set before the
view of the Church. \[They <span id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538)
place the wool among thorns\], that any one who wishes to bear it away
may find it necessary to suffer much, because the thorn is formidable,
and thus obtain it only as the result of suffering. Thus also, says He,
“Those who wish to behold Me, and lay hold of My kingdom, must through
tribulation and suffering obtain Me.” <span
id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1526"></span>[141:1527](0010343.htm#fr_1526) <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p1.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p2"></span> Cod. Sin. reads “temple,” which is
adopted by Hilgenfeld.

<span id="fn_1527"></span>[141:1528](0010343.htm#fr_1527) <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p3"></span> Not to be found in Scripture, as is the
case also with what follows. Hefele remarks, that “certain false
traditions respecting the Jewish rites seem to have prevailed among the
Christians of the second century, of which Barnabas here adopts some, as
do Justin (*Dial. c. Try.* 40) and Tertullian (*adv. Jud.* 14; *adv.
Marc.* iii. 7).”

<span id="fn_1528"></span>[141:1529](0010343.htm#fr_1528) <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p4"></span> Cod. Sin. has “by them.”

<span id="fn_1529"></span>[141:1530](0010343.htm#fr_1529) <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p5"></span> Cod. Sin. reads, “what commanded He?”

<span id="fn_1530"></span>[141:1531](0010343.htm#fr_1530) <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p5.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p6"></span> Cod. Sin. reads, “one as a
burnt-offering, and one for sins.”

<span id="fn_1531"></span>[141:1532](0010343.htm#fr_1531) <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p7"></span> Cod. Sin. reads, “type of God,” but it
has been corrected to “Jesus.”

<span id="fn_1532"></span>[141:1533](0010343.htm#fr_1532) <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p8"></span> In Cod. Sin. we find “*Rachel*.” The
orthography is doubtful, but there is little question that a kind of
bramble-bush is intended.

<span id="fn_1533"></span>[141:1534](0010343.htm#fr_1533) <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p9"></span> Thus the Latin interprets: others render
“shoots.”

<span id="fn_1534"></span>[141:1535](0010343.htm#fr_1534) <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p10"></span> Cod. Sin. has “thus” instead of “this.”

<span id="fn_1535"></span>[141:1536](0010343.htm#fr_1535) <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p11"></span> Literally, “was.”

<span id="fn_1536"></span>[141:1537](0010343.htm#fr_1536) <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p12"></span> The text is here in great confusion,
though the meaning is plain. Dressel reads, “For how are they alike, and
why \[does He enjoin\] that the goats should be good and alike?” The
Cod. Sin. reads, “How is He like Him? For this that,” etc.

<span id="fn_1537"></span>[141:1538](0010343.htm#fr_1537) <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p13"></span> Cod. Sin. here inserts “the goat.”

<span id="fn_1538"></span>[142:1539](0010343.htm#fr_1538) <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p14"></span> Cod. Sin. reads, “for as he who … so,
says he,” etc.

<span id="fn_1539"></span>[142:1540](0010343.htm#fr_1539) <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p15"></span> Comp. [Acts xiv.
22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022)<span id="vi.ii.vii-p15.1"></span>.
