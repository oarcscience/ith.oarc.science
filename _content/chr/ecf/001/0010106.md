### <span id="iv.iv.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Polycarp is brought into the city.

<span id="iv.iv.viii-p1"></span><span id="iv.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Now,
as soon as he had ceased praying, having made mention of all that had at
any time come in contact with him, both small and great, illustrious and
obscure, as well as the whole Catholic Church throughout the world, the
time of his departure having arrived, they set him upon an ass, and
conducted him into the city, the day being that of the great Sabbath.
And the Irenarch Herod, accompanied by his father Nicetes (both riding
in a chariot <span id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438) ), met him, and
taking him up into the chariot, they seated themselves beside him, and
endeavoured to persuade him, saying, “What harm is there in saying, Lord
Cæsar, <span id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439) and in sacrificing, with
the other ceremonies observed on such occasions, and so make sure of
safety?” But he at first gave them no answer; and when they continued to
urge him, <span id="page_41">p. 41</span> <span
id="iv.iv.viii-Page_41"></span> he said, “I shall not do as you advise
me.” So they, having no hope of persuading him, began to speak
bitter <span id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440) words unto him, and cast
him with violence out of the chariot, <span
id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441) insomuch that, in getting down from
the carriage, he dislocated his leg <span
id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442) \[by the fall\]. But without being
disturbed, <span id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443) and as if suffering
nothing, he went eagerly forward with all haste, and was conducted to
the stadium, where the tumult was so great, that there was no
possibility of being heard.
