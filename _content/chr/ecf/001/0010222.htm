<p><a name="v.ix-p1"></A><a name="v.ix-p1.1"></A><span class="upper"><a name="v.ix-p1.2"></A>When</span> the Syriac version of the Ignatian Epistles was introduced to the English world in 1845, by Mr. Cureton, the greatest satisfaction was expressed by many, who thought the inveterate controversy about to be settled. Lord Russell made the learned divine a canon of Westminster Abbey, and the critical Chevalier Bunsen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1129"></A><A HREF="#fn_1129"><FONT SIZE="1">1130</FONT></A>
 committed himself as its patron. To the credit of the learned, in general, the work was gratefully received, and studied with scientific conscientiousness by Lightfoot and others. The literature of this period is valuable; and the result is decisive as to the Curetonian versions at least, which are fragmentary and abridged, and yet they are a valuable contribution to the study of the whole case.</p>  
<p><a name="v.ix-p3"></A>The following is the original <span class="upper"><a name="v.ix-p3.1"></A>Introductory Notice</span>:&#8212;</p>  
<p><a name="v.ix-p4"></A><span class="upper"><a name="v.ix-p4.1"></A>Some</span> account of the discovery of the Syriac version of the Ignatian Epistles has been already given. We have simply to add here a brief description of the <span class="upper"><a name="v.ix-p4.2"></A>mss.</span> from which the Syriac text has been printed. That which is named <span class="Greek"><a name="v.ix-p4.3"></A>&#945;</span> by Cureton, contains only the Epistle to Polycarp, and exhibits the text of that Epistle which, after him, we have followed. He fixes its age somewhere in the first half of the sixth century, or before the year 550. The second <span class="upper"><a name="v.ix-p4.4"></A>ms.</span>, which Cureton refers to as <span class="Greek"><a name="v.ix-p4.5"></A>&#946;</span>, is assigned by him to the seventh or eighth century. It contains the three Epistles of Ignatius, and furnishes the text here followed in the Epistles to the Ephesians and Romans. The third <span class="upper"><a name="v.ix-p4.6"></A>ms.</span>, which Cureton quotes as <span class="Greek"><a name="v.ix-p4.7"></A>&#947;</span>, has no date, but, as he tells us, &#8220;belonged to the collection acquired by Moses of Nisibis in <span class="upper"><a name="v.ix-p4.8"></A>a.d.</span> 931, and was written apparently about three or four centuries earlier.&#8221; It contains the three Epistles to Polycarp, the Ephesians, and the Romans. The text of all these <span class="upper"><a name="v.ix-p4.9"></A>mss.</span> is in several passages manifestly corrupt, and the translators appear at times to have mistaken the meaning of the Greek original.</p>  
<p><a name="v.ix-p5"></A>[N.B.&#8212;Bunsen is forced to allow the fact that the discovery of the lost work of Hippolytus &#8220;throws new light on an obscure point of the Ignatian controversy,&#8221; i.e., the <i>Sige</i> in the Epistle to the Magnesians (cap. viii.); but his treatment of the matter is unworthy of a candid scholar.]</p>  <A NAME="page_98"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 98</FONT></A> <a name="v.ix-Page_98"></A>
