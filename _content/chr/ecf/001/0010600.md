### <span id="viii.iv.cxxxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXXIX.—The blessings, and also the curse, pronounced by Noah were prophecies of the future.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxxix-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxxix-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxxix-p1.2"></span>“For another mystery was accomplished
and predicted in the days of Noah, of which you are <span
id="page_269">p. 269</span> <span id="viii.iv.cxxxix-Page_269"></span>
not aware. It is this: in the blessings wherewith Noah blessed his two
sons, and in the curse pronounced on his son’s son. For the Spirit of
prophecy would not curse the son that had been by God blessed along with
\[his brothers\]. But since the punishment of the sin would cleave to
the whole descent of the son that mocked at his father’s nakedness, he
made the curse originate with *his* son. <span
id="fr_2479"></span>[2480](#fn_2479) Now, in what he said, he foretold
that the descendants of Shem would keep in retention the property and
dwellings of Canaan: and again that the descendants of Japheth would
take possession of the property of which Shem’s descendants had
dispossessed Canaan’s descendants; and spoil the descendants of Shem,
even as they plundered the sons of Canaan. And listen to the way in
which it has so come to pass. For you, who have derived your lineage
from Shem, invaded the territory of the sons of Canaan by the will of
God; and you possessed it. And it is manifest that the sons of Japheth,
having invaded you in turn by the judgment of God, have taken your land
from you, and have possessed it. Thus it is written: ‘And Noah awoke
from the wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him; and he
said, Cursed be Canaan, the servant; a servant shall he be unto his
brethren. And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall
be his servant. May the Lord enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the
houses of Shem; and let Canaan be his servant.’ <span
id="fr_2480"></span>[2481](#fn_2480) Accordingly, as two peoples were
blessed,—those from Shem, and those from Japheth,—and as the offspring
of Shem were decreed first to possess the dwellings of Canaan, and the
offspring of Japheth were predicted as in turn receiving the same
possessions, and to the two peoples there was the one people of Canaan
handed over for servants; so Christ has come according to the power
given Him from the Almighty Father, and summoning men to friendship, and
blessing, and repentance, and dwelling together, has promised, as has
already been proved, that there shall be a future possession for all the
saints in this same land. And hence all men everywhere, whether bond or
free, who believe in Christ, and recognise the truth in His own words
and those of His prophets, know that they shall be with Him in that
land, and inherit everlasting and incorruptible good.
