<p> <a name="ix.vii.xx"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="ix.vii.xx-p0.1"></A>Chapter XIX.&#8212;A comparison is instituted between the disobedient and sinning Eve and the Virgin Mary, her patroness. Various and discordant heresies are mentioned.</h3>  
<p><a name="ix.vii.xx-p1"></A>1. <a name="ix.vii.xx-p1.1"></A><a name="ix.vii.xx-p1.2"></A><a name="ix.vii.xx-p1.3"></A>That the Lord then was manifestly coming to His own things, and was sustaining them by means of that creation which is supported by Himself, and was making a recapitulation of that disobedience which had occurred in connection with a tree, through the obedience which was [exhibited by Himself when He hung] upon a tree, [the effects] also of that deception being done away with, by which that virgin Eve, who was already espoused to a man, was unhappily misled,&#8212;was happily announced, through means of the truth [spoken] by the angel to the Virgin Mary, who was [also espoused] to a man.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4615"></A><A HREF="#fn_4615"><FONT SIZE="1">4616</FONT></A>
 For just as the former was led astray by the word of an angel, so that she fled from God when she had transgressed His word; so did the latter, by an angelic communication, receive the glad tidings that she should sustain (<i>portaret</i>) God, being obedient to His word. And if the former did disobey God, yet the latter was persuaded to be obedient to God, in order that the Virgin Mary might become the patroness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4616"></A><A HREF="#fn_4616"><FONT SIZE="1">4617</FONT></A>
 (<i>advocata</i>) of the virgin Eve. And thus, as the human race fell into bondage to death by means of a virgin, so is it rescued by a virgin; virginal disobedience having been balanced in the opposite scale by virginal obedience. For in the same way the sin of the first created man (<i>protoplasti</i>) receives amendment by the correction of the First-begotten, and the coming of the serpent is conquered by the harmlessness of the dove, those bonds being unloosed by which we had been fast bound to death.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.vii.xx-p4"></A>2. <a name="ix.vii.xx-p4.1"></A>The heretics being all unlearned and ignorant of God&#146;s arrangements, and not acquainted with that dispensation by which He took upon Him human nature (<i>inscii ejus qu&aelig; est secundum hominem dispensationis</i>), inasmuch as they blind themselves with regard to the truth, do in fact speak against their own salvation. Some of them introduce another Father besides the Creator; some, again, say that the world and its substance was made by certain angels; certain others [maintain] that it was widely separated by Horos&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4617"></A><A HREF="#fn_4617"><FONT SIZE="1">4618</FONT></A>
 from him whom they represent as being the Father&#8212;that it sprang forth (<i>floruisse</i>) of itself, and from itself was born. Then, again, others [of them assert] that it obtained substance in those things which are contained by the Father, from defect and ignorance; others still, despise the advent of the Lord manifest [to the senses], for they do not admit His incarnation; while others, ignoring the arrangement [that He should be born] of a virgin, maintain that He was begotten by Joseph. And still further, some affirm that neither their soul nor their body can receive eternal life, but merely the inner man. Moreover, they will have it that this [inner man] is that which is the understanding (<i>sensum</i>) in them, and which they decree as being the only thing to ascend to &#8220;the perfect.&#8221; Others [maintain], as I have said in the first book, that while the soul is saved, their body does not participate in the salvation which comes from God; in which [book] I have also set forward the hypotheses of all these men, and in the second have pointed out their weakness and inconsistency.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.vii.xx-p2"></A> The text is here most uncertain and obscure.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.vii.xx-p3"></A> [This word <i>patroness</i> is ambiguous. The Latin may stand for Gr. <span class="Greek"><a name="ix.vii.xx-p3.1"></A>&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#8055;&#955;&#951;&#968;&#953;&#962;</span>, &#8212;a person called in to help, or to take hold of the other end of a burden. The argument implies that Mary was thus the counterpart or balance of Eve.]</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.vii.xx-p5"></A> The text reads &#8220;porro,&#8221; which makes no sense; so that Harvey looks upon it as a corruption of the reading &#8220;per Horum.&#8221;</p>
