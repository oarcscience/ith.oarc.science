### <span id="viii.iv.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Sabbaths were instituted on account of the people’s sins, and not for a work of righteousness.

<span id="viii.iv.xxi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxi-p1.2"></span>“Moreover, that God enjoined you to keep
the Sabbath, and impose on you other precepts for a sign, as I have
already said, on account of your unrighteousness, and that of your
fathers,—as He declares that for the sake of the nations, lest His name
be profaned among them, therefore He permitted some of you to remain
alive,—these words of His can prove to you: they are narrated by Ezekiel
thus: ‘I am the Lord your God; walk in My statutes, and keep My
judgments, and take no part in the customs of Egypt; and hallow My
Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that ye may know
that I am the Lord your God. Notwithstanding ye rebelled against Me, and
your children walked not in My statutes, neither kept My judgments to do
them: which if a man do, he shall live in them. But they polluted My
Sabbaths. And I said that I would pour out My fury upon them in the
wilderness, to accomplish My anger upon them; yet I did it not; that My
name might not be altogether profaned in the sight of the heathen. I led
them out before their eyes, and <span id="page_205">p. 205</span> <span
id="viii.iv.xxi-Page_205"></span> I lifted up Mine hand unto them in the
wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse
them through the countries; because they had not executed My judgments,
but had despised My statutes, and polluted My Sabbaths, and their eyes
were after the devices of their fathers. Wherefore I gave them also
statutes which were not good, and judgments whereby they shall not live.
And I shall pollute them in their own gifts, that I may destroy all that
openeth the womb, when I pass through them.’ <span
