### <span id="viii.iv.cxxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXVI.—The various names of Christ according to both natures. It is shown that He is God, and appeared to the patriarchs.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxvi-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxvi-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxvi-p1.3"></span><span id="viii.iv.cxxvi-p1.4"></span>“But
if you knew, Trypho,” continued I, “who He is that is called at one time
the Angel of great counsel, <span id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438)
and a Man by Ezekiel, and like the Son of man by Daniel, and a Child by
Isaiah, and Christ and God to be worshipped by David, and Christ and a
Stone by many, and Wisdom by Solomon, and Joseph and Judah and a Star by
Moses, and the East by Zechariah, and the Suffering One and Jacob and
Israel by Isaiah again, and a Rod, and Flower, and Corner-Stone, and Son
of God, you would not have blasphemed Him who has now come, and been
<span id="page_263">p. 263</span> <span
id="viii.iv.cxxvi-Page_263"></span> born, and suffered, and ascended to
heaven; who shall also come again, and then your twelve tribes shall
mourn. For if you had understood what has been written by the prophets,
you would not have denied that He was God, Son of the only, unbegotten,
unutterable God. <span id="viii.iv.cxxvi-p2.1"></span>For Moses says
somewhere in Exodus the following: ‘The Lord spoke to Moses, and said to
him, I am the Lord, and I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,
being their God; and my name I revealed not to them, and I established
my covenant with them.’ <span id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439) And
thus again he says, ‘A man wrestled with Jacob,’ <span
id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440) and asserts it was God; narrating
that Jacob said, ‘I have seen God face to face, and my life is
preserved.’ And it is recorded that he called the place where He
wrestled with him, appeared to and blessed him, the Face of God
(Peniel). And Moses says that God appeared also to Abraham near the oak
in Mamre, when he was sitting at the door of his tent at mid-day. Then
he goes on to say: ‘And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold,
three men stood before him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet
them.’ <span id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441) After a little, one of
them promises a son to Abraham: ‘Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying,
Shall I of a surety bear a child, and I am old? Is anything impossible
with God? At the time appointed I will return, according to the time of
life, and Sarah shall have a son. And they went away from
Abraham.’ <span id="fr_2442"></span>[2443](#fn_2442) Again he speaks of
them thus: ‘And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward
Sodom.’ <span id="fr_2443"></span>[2444](#fn_2443) Then to Abraham He
who was and is again speaks: ‘I will not hide from Abraham, my servant,
what I intend to do.’ ” <span id="fr_2444"></span>[2445](#fn_2444) And
what follows in the writings of Moses I quoted and explained; “from
which I have demonstrated,” I said, “that He who is described as God
appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and the other patriarchs,
was appointed under the authority of the Father and Lord, and ministers
to His will.” Then I went on to say what I had not said before: “And so,
when the people desired to eat flesh, and Moses had lost faith in Him,
who also there is called the Angel, and who promised that God would give
them to satiety, He who is both God and the Angel, sent by the Father,
is described as saying and doing these things. For thus the Scripture
says: ‘And the Lord said to Moses, Will the Lord’s hand not be
sufficient? thou shall know now whether my word shall conceal thee or
not.’ <span id="fr_2445"></span>[2446](#fn_2445) And again, in other
words, it thus says: ‘But the Lord spoke unto me, Thou shalt not go over
this Jordan: the Lord thy God, who goeth before thy face, He shall cut
off the nations.’ <span id="fr_2446"></span>[2447](#fn_2446)
