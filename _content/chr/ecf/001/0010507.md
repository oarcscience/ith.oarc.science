### <span id="viii.iv.xlvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLVI.—Trypho asks whether a man who keeps the law even now will be saved. Justin proves that it contributes nothing to righteousness.

<span id="viii.iv.xlvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xlvi-p1.1"></span>“But if some, even now, wish to live in
the observance of the institutions given by Moses, and yet believe in
this Jesus who was crucified, recognising Him to be the Christ of God,
and that it is given to Him to be absolute Judge of all, and that His is
the everlasting kingdom, can they also be saved?” he inquired of me.

<span id="viii.iv.xlvi-p2"></span>And I replied, “Let us consider that
also together, whether one may now observe all the Mosaic institutions.”

<span id="viii.iv.xlvi-p3"></span>And he answered, “No. For we know
that, as you said, it is not possible either anywhere to sacrifice the
lamb of the passover, or to offer the goats ordered for the fast; or, in
short, \[to present\] all the other offerings.”

<span id="viii.iv.xlvi-p4"></span>And I said, “Tell \[me\] then
yourself, I pray, some things which can be observed; for you will be
persuaded that, though a man does not keep or has not performed the
eternal <span id="fr_2085"></span>[2086](#fn_2085) decrees, he may
assuredly be saved.”

<span id="viii.iv.xlvi-p6"></span>Then he replied, “To keep the Sabbath,
to be circumcised, to observe months, and to be washed if you touch
anything prohibited by Moses, or after sexual intercourse.”

<span id="viii.iv.xlvi-p7"></span>And I said, “Do you think that
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Noah, and Job, and all the rest before <span
id="page_218">p. 218</span> <span id="viii.iv.xlvi-Page_218"></span> or
after them equally righteous, also Sarah the wife of Abraham, Rebekah
the wife of Isaac, Rachel the wife of Jacob, and Leah, and all the rest
of them, until the mother of Moses the faithful servant, who observed
none of these \[statutes\], will be saved?”

<span id="viii.iv.xlvi-p8"></span>And Trypho answered, “Were not Abraham
and his descendants circumcised?”

<span id="viii.iv.xlvi-p9"></span>And I said, “I know that Abraham and
his descendants were circumcised. The reason why circumcision was given
to them I stated at length in what has gone before; and if what has been
said does not convince you, <span id="fr_2086"></span>[2087](#fn_2086)
let us again search into the matter. But you are aware that, up to
Moses, no one in fact who was righteous observed any of these rites at
all of which we are talking, or received one commandment to observe,
except that of circumcision, which began from Abraham.”

<span id="viii.iv.xlvi-p11"></span>And he replied, “We know it, and
admit that they are saved.”

<span id="viii.iv.xlvi-p12"></span>Then I returned answer, “You perceive
that God by Moses laid all such ordinances upon you on account of the
hardness of your people’s hearts, in order that, by the large number of
them, you might keep God continually, and in every action, before your
eyes, and never begin to act unjustly or impiously. <span
id="viii.iv.xlvi-p12.1"></span>For He enjoined you to place around you
\[a fringe\] of purple dye, <span id="fr_2087"></span>[2088](#fn_2087)
in order that you might not forget God; and He commanded you to wear a
phylactery, <span id="fr_2088"></span>[2089](#fn_2088) certain
characters, which indeed we consider holy, being engraved on very thin
parchment; and by these means stirring you up <span
id="fr_2089"></span>[2090](#fn_2089) to retain a constant remembrance of
God: at the same time, however, convincing you, that in your hearts you
have not even a faint remembrance of God’s worship. Yet not even so were
you dissuaded from idolatry: for in the times of Elijah, when \[God\]
recounted the number of those who had not bowed the knee to Baal, He
said the number was seven thousand; and in Isaiah He rebukes you for
having sacrificed your children to idols. But we, because we refuse to
sacrifice to those to whom we were of old accustomed to sacrifice,
undergo extreme penalties, and rejoice in death,—believing that God will
raise us up by His Christ, and will make us incorruptible, and
undisturbed, and immortal; and we know that the ordinances imposed by
reason of the hardness of your people’s hearts, contribute nothing to
the performance of righteousness and of piety.”
