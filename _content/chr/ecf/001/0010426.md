### <span id="viii.ii.liii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LIII.—Summary of the prophecies.

<span id="viii.ii.liii-p1"></span>Though we could bring forward many
other prophecies, we forbear, judging these sufficient for the
persuasion of those who have ears to hear and understand; and
considering also that those persons are able to see that we do not make
mere assertions without being able to produce proof, like those fables
that are told of the so-called sons of Jupiter. <span
id="viii.ii.liii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.liii-p1.2"></span>For
with what reason should we believe of a crucified man that He is the
first-born of the unbegotten God, and Himself will pass judgment on the
whole human race, unless we had found testimonies concerning Him
published before He came and was born as man, and unless we saw that
things had happened accordingly—the devastation of the land of the Jews,
and men of every race persuaded by His teaching through the apostles,
and rejecting their old habits, in which, being deceived, they had their
conversation; yea, seeing ourselves too, and knowing that the Christians
from among the Gentiles are both more numerous and more true than those
from among the Jews and Samaritans? For all the other human races are
called Gentiles by the Spirit of prophecy; but the Jewish and Samaritan
races are called the tribe of Israel, and the house of Jacob. And the
prophecy in which it was predicted that there should be more believers
from the Gentiles than from the Jews and Samaritans, we will produce: it
ran thus: “Rejoice, O barren, thou that dost not bear; break forth and
shout, thou that dost not travail, because many more are the children of
the desolate than of her that hath an husband.” <span
id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878) For all the Gentiles were
“desolate” of the true God, serving the works of their hands; but the
Jews and Samaritans, having the word of God delivered to them by the
prophets, and always expecting the Christ, did not recognise Him when He
came, except some few, of whom the Spirit of prophecy by Isaiah had
predicted <span id="page_181">p. 181</span> <span
id="viii.ii.liii-Page_181"></span> that they should be saved. He spoke
as from their person: “Except the Lord had left us a seed, we should
have been as Sodom and Gomorrah.” <span
id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879) For Sodom and Gomorrah are related
by Moses to have been cities of ungodly men, which God burned with fire
and brimstone, and overthrew, no one of their inhabitants being saved
except a certain stranger, a Chaldæan by birth, whose name was Lot; with
whom also his daughters were rescued. And those who care may yet see
their whole country desolate and burned, and remaining barren. And to
show how those from among the Gentiles were foretold as more true and
more believing, we will cite what was said by Isaiah <span
id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880) the prophet; for he spoke as
follows “Israel is uncircumcised in heart, but the Gentiles are
uncircumcised in the flesh.” So many things therefore, as these, when
they are seen with the eye, are enough to produce conviction and belief
in those who embrace the truth, and are not bigoted in their opinions,
nor are governed by their passions.
