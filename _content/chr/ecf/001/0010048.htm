<p> <a name="ii.ii.xliii"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="ii.ii.xliii-p0.1"></A>Chapter XLIII.&#8212;Moses of old stilled the contention which arose concerning the priestly dignity.</h3>  
<p><a name="ii.ii.xliii-p1"></A><a name="ii.ii.xliii-p1.1"></A><a name="ii.ii.xliii-p1.2"></A><a name="ii.ii.xliii-p1.3"></A>And what wonder is it if those in Christ who were entrusted with such a duty by God, appointed those [ministers] before mentioned, when the blessed Moses also, &#8220;a faithful servant in all his house,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">186</FONT></A>
 noted down in the sacred books all the injunctions which were given him, and when the other prophets also followed him, bearing witness with one consent to the ordinances which he had appointed? <a name="ii.ii.xliii-p2.3"></A>For, when rivalry arose concerning the priesthood, and the tribes were contending among themselves as to which of them should be adorned with that glorious title, he commanded the twelve princes of the tribes to bring him their rods, each one being inscribed with the name&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">187</FONT></A>
 of the tribe. And he took them and bound them [together], and sealed them with the rings of the princes of the tribes, and laid them up in the tabernacle of witness on the table of God. And having shut the doors of the tabernacle, he sealed the keys, as he had done the rods, and said to them, Men and brethren, the tribe whose rod shall blossom has God chosen to fulfil the office of the priesthood, and to minister unto Him. And when the morning was come, he assembled all Israel, six hundred thousand men, and showed the seals to the princes of the tribes, and opened the tabernacle of witness, and brought forth the rods. And the rod of Aaron was found not only to have blossomed, but to bear fruit upon it.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_187"><FONT SIZE="1">188</FONT></A>
 What think ye, beloved? Did not Moses know beforehand that this would happen? Undoubtedly he knew; but he acted thus, that there might be no sedition in Israel, and that  <A NAME="page_17"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 17</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ii.xliii-Page_17"></A>  the name of the true and only God might be glorified; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
