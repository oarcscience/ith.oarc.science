<p> <a name="viii.vii.ii"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.vii.ii-p0.1"></A>Chapter II.&#8212;Testimonies to the unity of God.</h3>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.ii-p1"></A><a name="viii.vii.ii-p1.1"></A><a name="viii.vii.ii-p1.2"></A>First, then, &AElig;schylus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2596"></A><A HREF="#fn_2596"><FONT SIZE="1">2597</FONT></A>
 in expounding the arrangement of his work,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2597"></A><A HREF="#fn_2597"><FONT SIZE="1">2598</FONT></A>
 expressed himself also as follows respecting the only God:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.ii-p3.1"></A>&#8220;Afar from mortals place the holy God,<br>  Nor ever think that He, like to thyself,<br>  In fleshly robes is clad; for all unknown<br>  Is the great God to such a worm as thou.<br>  Divers similitudes He bears; at times<br>  He seems as a consuming fire that burns<br>  Unsated; now like water, then again<br>  In sable folds of darkness shrouds Himself.<br>  Nay, even the very beasts of earth reflect<br>  His sacred image; whilst the wind, clouds, rain,<br>  The roll of thunder and the lightning flash,<br>  Reveal to men their great and sovereign Lord.<br>  Before Him sea and rocks, with every fount,<br>  And all the water floods, in reverence bend;<br>  And as they gaze upon His awful face,<br>  Mountains and earth, with the profoundest depths<br>  Of ocean, and the highest peaks of hills,<br>  Tremble: for He is Lord Omnipotent;<br>  And this the glory is of God Most High.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.ii-p4"></A><a name="viii.vii.ii-p4.1"></A><a name="viii.vii.ii-p4.2"></A>But he was not the only man initiated in the knowledge of God; for Sophocles also thus describes the nature of the only Creator of all things, the One God:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.ii-p4.3"></A>&#8220;There is one God, in truth there is but one,<br>  Who made the heavens and the broad earth beneath,<br>  The glancing waves of ocean, and the winds;<br>  But many of us mortals err in heart,<br>  And set up, for a solace in our woes,<br>  Images of the gods in stone and brass,<br>  Or figures carved in gold or ivory;<br>  And, furnishing for these, our handiworks,<br>  Both sacrifice and rite magnificent,<br>  We think that thus we do a pious work.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.ii-p5"></A><a name="viii.vii.ii-p5.1"></A>And Philemon also, who published many explanations of ancient customs, shares in the knowledge of the truth; and thus he writes:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.ii-p5.2"></A>&#8220;Tell me what thoughts of God we should conceive?<br>  One, all things seeing, yet Himself unseen.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.ii-p6"></A><a name="viii.vii.ii-p6.1"></A><a name="viii.vii.ii-p6.2"></A><a name="viii.vii.ii-p6.3"></A>Even Orpheus, too, who introduces three hundred and sixty gods, will bear testimony in my  <A NAME="page_291"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 291</FONT></A> <a name="viii.vii.ii-Page_291"></A>  favour from the tract called <i>Diathec&aelig;</i>, in which he appears to repent of his error by writing the following:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.ii-p6.4"></A>&#8220;I&#146;ll speak to those who lawfully may hear;<br>  All others, ye profane, now close the doors!<br>  And, O Mus&aelig;us, hearken thou to me,<br>  Who offspring art of the light-bringing moon.<br>  The words I tell thee now are true indeed,<br>  And if thou former thoughts of mine hast seen,<br>  Let them not rob thee of the blessed life;<br>  But rather turn the depths of thine own heart<br>  Unto that place where light and knowledge dwell.<br>  Take thou the word divine to guide thy steps;<br>  And walking well in the straight certain path,<br>  Look to the one and universal King,<br>  One, self-begotten, and the only One<br>  Of whom all things, and we ourselves, are sprung.<br>  All things are open to His piercing gaze,<br>  While He Himself is still invisible;<br>  Present in all His works, though still unseen,<br>  He gives to mortals evil out of good,<br>  Sending both chilling wars and tearful griefs;<br>  And other than the Great King there is none.<br>  The clouds for ever settle round His throne;<br>  And mortal eyeballs in mere mortal eyes<br>  Are weak to see Jove, reigning over all.<br>  He sits established in the brazen heavens<br>  Upon His throne; and underneath His feet<br>  He treads the earth, and stretches His right hand<br>  To all the ends of ocean, and around<br>  Tremble the mountain ranges, and the streams,<br>  The depths, too, of the blue and hoary sea.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.ii-p7"></A>He speaks indeed as if he had been an eyewitness of God&#146;s greatness. And Pythagoras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2598"></A><A HREF="#fn_2598"><FONT SIZE="1">2599</FONT></A>
 agrees with him when he writes:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.ii-p8.2"></A>&#8220;Should one in boldness say, Lo, I am God!<br>  Besides the One&#8212;Eternal&#8212;Infinite,<br>  Then let him from the throne he has usurped<br>  Put forth his power and form another globe,<br>  Such as we dwell in, saying, This is mine.<br>  Nor only so, but in this new domain<br>  For ever let him dwell. If this he can,<br>  Then verily he is a god proclaimed.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>
