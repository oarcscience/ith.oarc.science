### <span id="viii.iv.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—In what the true fasting consists.

<span id="viii.iv.xv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>“Learn, therefore, to keep the true fast of
God, as Isaiah says, that you may please God. Isaiah has cried thus:
‘Shout vehemently, and do not spare: lift up thy voice as with a
trumpet, and show My people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob
their sins. They seek Me from day to day, and desire to know My ways, as
a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the judgment of God.
They ask of Me now righteous judgment, and desire to draw near to God,
saying, Wherefore have we fasted, and Thou seest not? and afflicted our
souls, and Thou hast not known? Because in the days of your fasting you
find your own pleasure, and oppress all those who are subject to you.
Behold, ye fast for strifes and debates, and smite the humble with your
fists. Why do ye fast for Me, as to-day, so that your voice is heard
aloud? This is not the fast which I have chosen, the day in which a man
shall afflict his soul. And not even if you bend your neck like a ring,
or clothe yourself in sackcloth and ashes, shall you call this a fast,
and a day acceptable to the Lord. This is not the fast which I have
chosen, saith the Lord; but loose every unrighteous bond, dissolve the
terms of wrongous covenants, let the oppressed go free, and avoid every
iniquitous contract. Deal thy bread to the hungry, and lead the homeless
poor under thy dwelling; if thou seest the naked, clothe him; and do not
hide thyself from thine own flesh. Then shall thy light break forth as
the morning, and thy garments <span id="fr_1979"></span>[1980](#fn_1979)
shall rise up quickly: and thy righteousness shall go before thee, and
the glory of God shall envelope thee. Then shalt thou cry, and the Lord
shall hear thee: while thou art speaking, He will say, Behold, I am
here. And if thou take away from thee the yoke, and the stretching out
of the hand, and the word of murmuring; and shalt give heartily thy
bread to the hungry, and shalt satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall
thy light arise in the darkness, and thy darkness shall be as the
noon-day: and thy God shall be with thee continually, and thou shalt be
satisfied according as thy soul desireth, and thy bones shall become
fat, and shall be as a watered garden, and as a fountain of water, or as
a land where water fails not.’ <span
id="fr_1980"></span>[1981](#fn_1980) ‘Circumcise, therefore, the
foreskin of your heart,’ as the words of God in all these passages
demand.”
