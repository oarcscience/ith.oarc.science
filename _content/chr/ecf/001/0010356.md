### <span id="vi.ii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—The way of darkness.

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xx-p1.1"></span><span
id="vi.ii.xx-p1.2"></span><span id="vi.ii.xx-p1.3"></span><span
id="vi.ii.xx-p1.4"></span><span id="vi.ii.xx-p1.5"></span><span
id="vi.ii.xx-p1.6"></span>But the way of darkness <span
id="fr_1712"></span>[1713](#fn_1712) is crooked, and full of cursing;
for it is the way of eternal <span id="fr_1713"></span>[1714](#fn_1713)
death with punishment, in which way are the things that destroy the
soul, viz., idolatry, over-confidence, the arrogance of power,
hypocrisy, double-heartedness, adultery, murder, rapine, haughtiness,
transgression, <span id="fr_1714"></span>[1715](#fn_1714) deceit,
malice, self-sufficiency, poisoning, magic, avarice, <span
id="fr_1715"></span>[1716](#fn_1715) want of the fear of God. \[In this
way, too,\] are those who persecute the good, those who hate truth,
those who love falsehood, those who know not the reward of
righteousness, those who cleave not to that which is good, those who
attend not with just judgment to the widow and orphan, those who watch
not to the fear of God, \[but incline\] to wickedness, from whom
meekness and patience are far off; persons who love vanity, follow after
a reward, pity not the needy, labour not in aid of him who is overcome
with toil; who are prone to evil-speaking, who know not Him that made
them, who are murderers of children, destroyers of the workmanship of
God; who turn away him that is in want, who oppress the afflicted, who
are advocates of the rich, who are unjust judges of the poor, and who
are in every respect transgressors.
