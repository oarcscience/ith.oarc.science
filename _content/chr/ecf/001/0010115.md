### <span id="iv.iv.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—The Christians are refused Polycarp’s body.

<span id="iv.iv.xvii-p1"></span><span id="iv.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>But
when the adversary of the race of the righteous, the envious, malicious,
and wicked one, perceived the impressive <span
id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462) nature of his martyrdom, and
\[considered\] the blameless life he had led from the beginning, and how
he was now crowned with the wreath of immortality, having beyond dispute
received his reward, he did his utmost that not the least memorial of
him should be taken away by us, although many desired to do this, and to
become possessors <span id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463) of his holy
flesh. For this end he suggested it to Nicetes, the father of Herod and
brother of Alce, to go and entreat the governor not to give up his body
to be buried, “lest,” said he, “forsaking Him <span id="page_43">p.
43</span> <span id="iv.iv.xvii-Page_43"></span> that was crucified, they
begin to worship this one.” This he said at the suggestion and urgent
persuasion of the Jews, who also watched us, as we sought to take him
out of the fire, being ignorant of this, that it is neither possible for
us ever to forsake Christ, who suffered for the salvation of such as
shall be saved throughout the whole world (the blameless one for
sinners <span id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464) ), nor to worship any
other. For Him indeed, as being the Son of God, we adore; but the
martyrs, as disciples and followers of the Lord, we worthily love on
account of their extraordinary <span id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465)
affection towards their own King and Master, of whom may we also be made
companions <span id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466) and fellow-disciples!
