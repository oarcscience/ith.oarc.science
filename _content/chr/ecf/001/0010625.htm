<p><a name="viii.vi.xv-p1"></A><a name="viii.vi.xv-p1.1"></A><a name="viii.vi.xv-p1.2"></A>At all events, we must remind you what Orpheus, who was, as one might say, your first teacher of polytheism, latterly addressed to his son Mus&aelig;us, and to the other legitimate auditors, concerning the one and only God. And he spoke thus:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vi.xv-p1.3"></A>&#8220;I speak to those who lawfully may hear:<br>  All others, ye profane, now close the doors,<br>  And, O Mus&aelig;us! hearken thou to me,<br>  Who offspring art of the light-bringing moon:<br>  The words I utter now are true indeed;<br>  And if thou former thoughts of mine hast seen,<br>  Let them not rob thee of the blessed life,<br>  But rather turn the depths of thine own heart<br>  Unto the place where light and knowledge dwell.<br>  Take thou the word divine to guide thy steps,<br>  And walking well in the straight certain path,<br>  Look to the one and universal King&#8212;<br>  One, self-begotten, and the only One,<br>  Of whom all things and we ourselves are sprung.<br>  All things are open to His piercing gaze,<br>  While He Himself is still invisible.<br>  Present in all His works, though still unseen,<br>  He gives to mortals evil out of good,<br>  Sending both chilling wars and tearful griefs;<br>  And other than the great King there is none.<br>  The clouds for ever settle round His throne,<br>  And mortal eyeballs in mere mortal eyes<br>  Are weak, to see Jove reigning over all.<br>  He sits established in the brazen heavens<br>  Upon His golden throne; under His feet<br>  He treads the earth, and stretches His right hand<br>  To all the ends of ocean, and around<br>  Tremble the mountain ranges and the streams,<br>  The depths, too, of the blue and hoary sea.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vi.xv-p2"></A>  <A NAME="page_280"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 280</FONT></A> <a name="viii.vi.xv-Page_280"></A>  And again, in some other place he says:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vi.xv-p2.1"></A>&#8220;There is one Zeus alone, one sun, one hell,<br>  One Bacchus; and in all things but one God;<br>  Nor of all these as diverse let me speak.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vi.xv-p3"></A>And when he swears he says:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vi.xv-p3.1"></A>&#8220;Now I adjure thee by the highest heaven,<br>  The work of the great God, the only wise;<br>  And I adjure thee by the Father&#146;s voice.<br>  Which first He uttered when He stablished<br>  The whole world by His counsel.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vi.xv-p4"></A>What does he mean by &#8220;I adjure thee by the Father&#146;s voice, which first He uttered?&#8221; It is the Word of God which he here names &#8220;the voice,&#8221; by whom heaven and earth and the whole creation were made, as the divine prophecies of the holy men teach us; and these he himself also paid some attention to in Egypt, and understood that all creation was made by the Word of God; and therefore, after he says, &#8220;I adjure thee by the Father&#146;s voice, which first He uttered,&#8221; he adds this besides, &#8220;when by His counsel He established the whole world.&#8221; Here he calls the Word &#8220;voice,&#8221; for the sake of the poetical metre. And that this is so, is manifest from the fact, that a little further on, where the metre permits him, he names it &#8220;Word.&#8221; For he said:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vi.xv-p4.1"></A>&#8220;Take thou the <i>Word</i> divine to guide thy steps.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>
