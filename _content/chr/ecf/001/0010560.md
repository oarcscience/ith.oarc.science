### <span id="viii.iv.xcix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XCIX.—In the commencement of the Psalm are Christ’s dying words.

<span id="viii.iv.xcix-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xcix-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xcix-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xcix-p1.3"></span>And when I had said these words, I
continued: “Now I will demonstrate to you that the whole Psalm refers
thus to Christ, by the words which I shall again explain. What is said
at first—‘O God, my God, attend to me: why hast Thou forsaken
me?’—announced from the beginning that which was to be said in the time
of Christ. For when crucified, He spake: ‘O God, my God, why hast Thou
forsaken me?’ And what follows: ‘The words of my transgressions are far
from my salvation. O my God, I will cry to Thee in the day-time, and
Thou wilt not hear; and in the night-season, and it is not for want of
understanding in me.’ These, as well as the things which He was to do,
were spoken. For on the day on which He was to be crucified, <span
id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324) having taken three of His disciples
to the hill called Olivet, situated opposite to the temple in Jerusalem,
He prayed in these words: ‘Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass
from me.’ <span id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325) And again He
prayed: ‘Not as I will, but as Thou wilt;’ <span
id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326) showing by this that He had become
truly a suffering man. But lest any one should say, He did not know then
that He had to suffer, He adds immediately in the Psalm: ‘And it is not
for want of understanding in me.’ Even as there was no ignorance on
God’s part when He asked Adam where he was, or asked Cain where Abel
was; but \[it was done\] to convince each what kind of man he was, and
in order that through the record \[of Scripture\] we might have a
knowledge of all: so likewise Christ declared that ignorance was not on
His side, but on theirs, who thought that He was not the Christ, but
fancied they would put Him to death, and that He, like some common
mortal, would remain in Hades.
