<p> <a name="viii.iv.lxxi"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.iv.lxxi-p0.1"></A>Chapter LXXI.&#8212;The Jews reject the interpretation of the LXX., from which, moreover, they have taken away some passages.</h3>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.lxxi-p1"></A><a name="viii.iv.lxxi-p1.1"></A><a name="viii.iv.lxxi-p1.2"></A>&#8220;But I am far from putting reliance in your teachers, who refuse to admit that the interpretation made by the seventy elders who were with Ptolemy [king] of the Egyptians is a correct one; and they attempt to frame another. And I wish you to observe, that they have altogether taken away many Scriptures from the translations effected by those seventy elders who were with Ptolemy, and by which this very man who was crucified is proved to have been set forth expressly as God, and man, and as being crucified, and as dying; but since I am aware that this is denied by all of your nation, I do not address myself to these points, but I proceed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2216"></A><A HREF="#fn_2216"><FONT SIZE="1">2217</FONT></A>
 to carry on my discussions by means of those passages which are still admitted by you. For you assent to those which I have brought before your attention, except that you contradict the statement, &#145;Behold, the virgin shall conceive,&#146; and say it ought to be read, &#145;Behold, the young woman shall conceive.&#146; And I promised to prove that the prophecy referred, not, as you were taught, to Hezekiah, but to this Christ of mine: and now I shall go to the proof.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.lxxi-p3"></A>Here Trypho remarked, &#8220;We ask you first of all to tell us some of the Scriptures which you allege have been completely cancelled.&#8221;</p>
