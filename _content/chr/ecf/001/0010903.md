### <span id="ix.viii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>XXVIII.

<span id="ix.viii.xxviii-p1"></span><span
id="ix.viii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>“And the man of God said, Where did it
fall? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a tree, and cast it
in there, and the iron floated.” <span
id="fr_4842"></span>[4843](#fn_4842) This was a sign that souls should
be borne aloft (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.viii.xxviii-p2.2"></span>ἀναγωγῆς ψυχῶν</span>) through the
instrumentality of wood, upon which He suffered who can lead those souls
aloft that follow His ascension. This event was also an indication of
<span id="page_573">p. 573</span> <span
id="ix.viii.xxviii-Page_573"></span> the fact, that when the holy soul
of Christ descended \[to Hades\], many souls ascended and were seen in
their bodies. <span id="fr_4843"></span>[4844](#fn_4843) For just as the
wood, which is the lighter body, was submerged in the water; but the
iron, the heavier one, floated: so, when the Word of God became one with
flesh, by a physical and hypostatic union, the heavy and terrestrial
\[part\], having been rendered immortal, was borne up into heaven, by
the divine nature, after the resurrection.
