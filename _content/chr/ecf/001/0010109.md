### <span id="iv.iv.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—No threats have any effect on Polycarp.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p1"></span>The proconsul then said to him, “I have
wild beasts at hand; to these will I cast thee, except thou repent.” But
he answered, “Call them then, for we are not accustomed to repent of
what is good in order to adopt that which is evil; <span
id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448) and it is well for me to be changed
from what is evil to what is righteous.” <span
id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449) But again the proconsul said to him,
“I will cause thee to be consumed by fire, seeing thou despisest the
wild beasts, if thou wilt not repent.” But Polycarp said, “Thou
threatenest me with fire which burneth for an hour, and after a little
is extinguished, but art ignorant of the fire of the coming judgment and
of eternal punishment, reserved for the ungodly. But why tarriest thou?
Bring forth what thou wilt.”

to things worse is a change impossible to us.”
