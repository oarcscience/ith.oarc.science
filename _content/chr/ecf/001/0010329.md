### <span id="v.xxv.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Ignatius sails to Smyrna.

<span id="v.xxv.iii-p1"></span><span
id="v.xxv.iii-p1.1"></span>Wherefore, with great alacrity and joy,
through his desire to suffer, he came down from Antioch to Seleucia,
from which place he set sail. And after a great deal of suffering he
came to Smyrna, where he disembarked with great joy, and hastened to see
the holy Polycarp, \[formerly\] his fellow-disciple, and \[now\] bishop
of Smyrna. For they had both, in old times, been disciples of St. John
the Apostle. Being then brought to him, and having communicated to him
some spiritual gifts, and glorying in his bonds, he entreated of him to
labour <span id="fr_1414"></span>[1415](#fn_1414) along with him for the
fulfilment of his desire; earnestly indeed asking this of the whole
Church (for the cities and Churches of Asia had welcomed <span
id="fr_1415"></span>[1416](#fn_1415) the holy man through their bishops,
and presbyters, and deacons, all hastening to meet him, if by any means
they might receive from him some <span
id="fr_1416"></span>[1417](#fn_1416) spiritual gift), but above all, the
holy Polycarp, that, by means of the wild beasts, he soon disappearing
from this world, might be manifested before the face of Christ.
