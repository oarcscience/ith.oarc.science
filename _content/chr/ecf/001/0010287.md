### <span id="v.xvi.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Concluding salutations and instructions.

<span id="v.xvi.ix-p1"></span>Salute Cassian, my host, and his most
serious-minded partner in life, and their very dear children, <span
id="page_115">p. 115</span> <span id="v.xvi.ix-Page_115"></span> to whom
may “God grant that they find mercy of the Lord in that day,” <span
id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293) on account of their ministrations
to us, whom also I commend to thee in Christ. Salute by name all the
faithful in Christ that are at Laodicea. Do not neglect those at Tarsus,
but look after them steadily, confirming them in the Gospel. I salute in
the Lord, Maris the bishop of Neapolis, near Anazarbus. Salute thou also
Mary my daughter, distinguished both for gravity and erudition, as also
“the Church which is in her house.” <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294) May my soul be in place of hers:
she is the very pattern of pious women. May the Father of Christ, by His
only-begotten Son, preserve thee in good health, and of high repute in
all things, to a very old age, for the benefit of the Church of God!
Farewell in the Lord, and pray thou that I may be perfected.
