<p> <a name="viii.ii.xliv"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.ii.xliv-p0.1"></A>Chapter XLIV.&#8212;Not nullified by prophecy.</h3>  
<p><a name="viii.ii.xliv-p1"></A><a name="viii.ii.xliv-p1.1"></A><a name="viii.ii.xliv-p1.2"></A>And the holy Spirit of prophecy taught us this, telling us by Moses that God spoke thus to the man first created: &#8220;Behold, before thy face are good and evil: choose the good.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1855"></A><A HREF="#fn_1855"><FONT SIZE="1">1856</FONT></A>
 And again, by the other prophet Isaiah, that the following utterance was made as if from God the Father and Lord of all: &#8220;Wash you, make you clean; put away evils from your souls; learn to do well; judge the orphan, and plead for the widow: and come and let us reason together, saith the Lord: And if your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as wool; and if they be red like as crimson, I will make them white as snow. And if ye be willing and obey Me, ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye do not obey Me, the sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1856"></A><A HREF="#fn_1856"><FONT SIZE="1">1857</FONT></A>
 And that expression, &#8220;The sword shall devour you,&#8221; does not mean that the disobedient shall be slain by the sword, but the sword of God is fire, of which they who choose to do wickedly become the fuel. Wherefore He says, &#8220;The sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.&#8221; And if He had spoken concerning a sword that cuts and at once despatches, He would not have said, shall <i>devour</i>. <a name="viii.ii.xliv-p3.2"></A>And so, too, Plato, when he says, &#8220;The blame is his who chooses, and God is blameless,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1857"></A><A HREF="#fn_1857"><FONT SIZE="1">1858</FONT></A>
 took this from the prophet Moses and uttered it. For Moses is more ancient than all the Greek writers. <a name="viii.ii.xliv-p4.1"></A>And whatever both philosophers and poets have said concerning the immortality of the soul, or punishments after death, or contemplation of things heavenly, or doctrines of the like kind, they have received such suggestions from the prophets as have enabled them to understand and interpret these things. And hence there seem to be seeds of truth among all men; but they are charged with not accurately understanding [the truth] when they assert contradictories. <a name="viii.ii.xliv-p4.2"></A>So that what we say about future events being foretold, we do not say it as if they came about by a fatal necessity; but God foreknowing all that shall be done by all men, and it being His decree that the future actions of men shall all be recompensed according to their several value, He foretells by the Spirit of prophecy that He will bestow meet rewards according to the merit of the actions done, always urging the human  <A NAME="page_178"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 178</FONT></A> <a name="viii.ii.xliv-Page_178"></A>  race to effort and recollection, showing that He cares and provides for men. But by the agency of the devils death has been decreed against those who read the books of Hystaspes, or of the Sibyl,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1858"></A><A HREF="#fn_1858"><FONT SIZE="1">1859</FONT></A>
 or of the prophets, that through fear they may prevent men who read them from receiving the knowledge of the good, and may retain them in slavery to themselves; which, however, they could not always effect. For not only do we fearlessly read them, but, as you see, bring them for your inspection, knowing that their contents will be pleasing to all. And if we persuade even a few, our gain will be very great; for, as good husbandmen, we shall receive the reward from the Master.</p>
