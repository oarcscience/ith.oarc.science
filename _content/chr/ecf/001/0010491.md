### <span id="viii.iv.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Christians possess the true righteousness.

<span id="viii.iv.xxx-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxx-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xxx-p1.2"></span>“But
impute it to your own wickedness, that God even can be accused by those
who have no understanding, of not having always instructed all in the
same righteous statutes. For such institutions seemed to be unreasonable
and unworthy of God to many men, who had not received grace to know that
your nation were called to conversion and repentance of spirit, <span
id="fr_2024"></span>[2025](#fn_2024) while they were in a sinful
condition and labouring under spiritual disease; and that the prophecy
which was announced subsequent to the death of Moses is everlasting. And
this is mentioned in the Psalm, my friends. <span
id="fr_2025"></span>[2026](#fn_2025) And that we, who have been made
wise by them, confess that the statutes of the Lord are sweeter than
honey and the honey-comb, is manifest from the fact that, though
threatened with death, we do not deny His name. Moreover, it is also
manifest to all, that we who believe in Him pray to be kept by Him from
strange, i.e., from wicked and deceitful, spirits; as the word of
prophecy, personating one of those who believe in Him, figuratively
declares. For we do continually beseech God by Jesus Christ to preserve
us from the demons which are hostile to the worship of God, and whom we
of old time served, in order that, after our conversion by Him to God,
we may be blameless. For we call Him Helper and Redeemer, the power of
whose name even the demons do fear; and at this day, when they are
exorcised in the name of Jesus Christ, crucified under Pontius Pilate,
governor of Judæa, they are overcome. And thus it is manifest to all,
that His Father has given Him so great power, by virtue of which demons
are subdued to His name, and to the dispensation of His suffering.
