### <span id="ix.vi.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Abraham’s faith was identical with ours; this faith was prefigured by the words and actions of the old patriarchs.

<span id="ix.vi.xxii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vi.xxii-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.vi.xxii-p1.2"></span>But that
our faith was also prefigured in Abraham, and that he was the patriarch
of our faith, and, as it were, the prophet of it, the apostle has very
fully taught, when he says in the Epistle to the Galatians: “He
therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among
you, \[doeth he it\] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of
faith? Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted unto him for
righteousness. Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith, the same
are the children of Abraham. But the Scripture, foreseeing that God
would justify the heathen through faith, announced beforehand unto
Abraham, that in him all nations should be blessed. So then they which
be of faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.” <span
id="fr_4113"></span>[4114](#fn_4113) For which \[reasons the apostle\]
declared that this man was not only the prophet of faith, but also the
father of those who from among the Gentiles believe in Jesus Christ,
because his faith and ours are one and the same: for he believed in
things future, as if they were already accomplished, because of the
promise of God; and in like manner do we also, because of the promise of
God, behold through faith that inheritance \[laid up for us\] in the
\[future\] kingdom.

<span id="ix.vi.xxii-p3"></span>2. <span id="ix.vi.xxii-p3.1"></span>The
history of Isaac, too, is not without a <span id="page_493">p.
493</span> <span id="ix.vi.xxii-Page_493"></span> symbolical character.
For in the Epistle to the Romans, the apostle declares: “Moreover, when
Rebecca had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac,” she received
answer <span id="fr_4114"></span>[4115](#fn_4114) from the Word, “that
the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but
of Him that calleth, it was said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb,
and two manner of people are in thy body; and the one people shall
overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.” <span
id="fr_4115"></span>[4116](#fn_4115) From which it is evident, that not
only \[were there\] prophecies of the patriarchs, but also that the
children brought forth by Rebecca were a prediction of the two nations;
and that the one should be indeed the greater, but the other the less;
that the one also should be under bondage, but the other free; but
\[that both should be\] of one and the same father. Our God, one and the
same, is also their God, who knows hidden things, who knoweth all things
before they can come to pass; and for this reason has He said, “Jacob
have I loved, but Esau have I hated.” <span
id="fr_4116"></span>[4117](#fn_4116)

<span id="ix.vi.xxii-p7"></span>3. <span id="ix.vi.xxii-p7.1"></span>If
any one, again, will look into Jacob’s actions, he shall find them not
destitute of meaning, but full of import with regard to the
dispensations. Thus, in the first place, at his birth, since he laid
hold on his brother’s heel, <span id="fr_4117"></span>[4118](#fn_4117)
he was called Jacob, that is, *the supplanter*—one who holds, but is not
held; binding the feet, but not being bound; striving and conquering;
grasping in his hand his adversary’s heel, that is, victory. For to this
end was the Lord born, the type of whose birth he set forth beforehand,
of whom also John says in the Apocalypse: “He went forth conquering,
that He should conquer.” <span id="fr_4118"></span>[4119](#fn_4118) In
the next place, \[Jacob\] received the rights of the first-born, when
his brother looked on them with contempt; even as also the younger
nation received Him, Christ, the first-begotten, when the elder nation
rejected Him, saying, “We have no king but Cæsar.” <span
id="fr_4119"></span>[4120](#fn_4119) But in Christ every blessing \[is
summed up\], and therefore the latter people has snatched away the
blessings of the former from the Father, just as Jacob took away the
blessing of this Esau. For which cause his brother suffered the plots
and persecutions of a brother, just as the Church suffers this self-same
thing from the Jews. In a foreign country were the twelve tribes born,
the race of Israel, inasmuch as Christ was also, in a strange country,
to generate the twelve-pillared foundation of the Church. Various
coloured sheep were allotted to this Jacob as his wages; and the wages
of Christ are human beings, who from various and diverse nations come
together into one cohort of faith, as the Father promised Him, saying,
“Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, the
uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession.” <span
id="fr_4120"></span>[4121](#fn_4120) And as from the multitude of his
sons the prophets of the Lord \[afterwards\] arose, there was every
necessity that Jacob should beget sons from the two sisters, even as
Christ did from the two laws of one and the same Father; and in like
manner also from the handmaids, indicating that Christ should raise up
sons of God, both from freemen and from slaves after the flesh,
bestowing upon all, in the same manner, the gift of the Spirit, who
vivifies us. <span id="fr_4121"></span>[4122](#fn_4121) But he (Jacob)
did all things for the sake of the younger, she who had the handsome
eyes, <span id="fr_4122"></span>[4123](#fn_4122) Rachel, who prefigured
the Church, for which Christ endured patiently; who at that time,
indeed, by means of His patriarchs and prophets, was prefiguring and
declaring beforehand future things, fulfilling His part by anticipation
in the dispensations of God, and accustoming His inheritance to obey
God, and to pass through the world as in a state of pilgrimage, to
follow His word, and to indicate beforehand things to come. For with God
there is nothing without purpose or due signification.
