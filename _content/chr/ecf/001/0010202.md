### <span id="v.vii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Christ was possessed of a body after His resurrection.

<span id="v.vii.iii-p1"></span><span id="v.vii.iii-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.vii.iii-p1.2"></span><span id="v.vii.iii-p1.3"></span>For I know
that after His resurrection also He was still possessed of flesh, <span
id="fr_989"></span>[990](#fn_989) and I believe that He is so now. When,
for instance, He came to those who were with Peter, He said to them,
“Lay hold, handle Me, and see that I am not an incorporeal
spirit.” <span id="fr_990"></span>[991](#fn_990) And immediately they
touched Him, and believed, being convinced both by His flesh and spirit.
For this cause also they despised death, and were found its
conquerors. <span id="fr_991"></span>[992](#fn_991) And after his
resurrection He did eat and drink with them, as being possessed of
flesh, although spiritually He was united to the Father.

<span id="v.vii.iii-p5"></span><span id="v.vii.iii-p5.1"></span><span
id="v.vii.iii-p5.2"></span><span id="v.vii.iii-p5.3"></span>And I know
that He was possessed of a body not only in His being born and
crucified, but I also know that He was so after His resurrection, and
believe that He is so now. When, for instance, He came to those who were
with Peter, He said to them, “Lay hold, handle Me, and see that I am not
an incorporeal spirit.” <span id="fr_992"></span>[993](#fn_992) “For a
spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see Me have.” <span
id="fr_993"></span>[994](#fn_993) And He says to Thomas, “Reach hither
thy finger into the print of the nails, and reach hither thy hand, and
thrust it into My side;” <span id="fr_994"></span>[995](#fn_994) and
immediately they believed that He was Christ. Wherefore Thomas also says
to Him, “My Lord, and my God.” <span id="fr_995"></span>[996](#fn_995)
And on this account also did they despise death, for it were too little
to say, indignities and stripes. Nor was this all; but also after He had
shown Himself to them, that He had risen indeed, and not in appearance
only, He both ate and drank with them during forty entire days. <span
id="v.vii.iii-p9.2"></span>And thus was He, with the flesh, received up
in their sight unto Him that sent Him, being with that same flesh to
come again, accompanied by glory and power. For, say the \[holy\]
oracles, “This same Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall
so come, in like manner as ye have seen Him go unto heaven.” <span
id="fr_996"></span>[997](#fn_996) But if they say that He will come at
the end of the world without a body, how shall those “see Him that
pierced Him,” <span id="fr_997"></span>[998](#fn_997) and when they
recognise Him, “mourn for themselves?” <span
id="fr_998"></span>[999](#fn_998) For incorporeal beings have neither
form nor figure, nor the aspect <span id="fr_999"></span>[1000](#fn_999)
of an animal possessed of shape, because their nature is in itself
simple.
