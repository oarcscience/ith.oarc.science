### <span id="ix.viii.xviii-p0.1"></span>XVIII.

<span id="ix.viii.xviii-p1"></span>And this was not without meaning; but
that by means of the number of the ten men, <span
id="fr_4824"></span>[4825](#fn_4824) he (Gideon) might appear as having
Jesus for a helper, as \[is indicated\] by the compact entered into with
them. And when he did not choose to partake with them in their
idol-worship, they threw the blame upon him: for “Jerubbaal” signifies
the judgment-seat of Baal.

out this allegory, but it is thought that he refers to the initial
letter in the name <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.viii.xviii-p2.2"></span>᾽Ιησοῦς</span>, which stands for *ten* in
the Greek enumeration. Compare the *Epistle of Barnabas*, cap. ix. p.
143, of this volume.
