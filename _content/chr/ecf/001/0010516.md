### <span id="viii.iv.lv-p0.1"></span>Chapter LV.—Trypho asks that Christ be proved God, but without metaphor. Justin promises to do so.

<span id="viii.iv.lv-p1"></span>And Trypho answered, “We shall remember
this your exposition, if you strengthen \[your solution of\] this
difficulty by other arguments: but now resume the discourse, and show us
that the Spirit of prophecy admits another God besides the Maker of all
things, taking care not to speak of the sun and moon, which, it is
written, <span id="fr_2118"></span>[2119](#fn_2118) God has given to the
nations to worship as gods; and oftentimes the prophets, employing <span
id="fr_2119"></span>[2120](#fn_2119) this manner of speech, say that
‘thy God is a God of gods, and a Lord of lords,’ adding frequently, ‘the
great and strong and terrible \[God\].’ For such expressions are used,
not as if they really were gods, but because the Scripture is teaching
us that the true God, who made all things, is Lord alone of those who
are reputed gods and lords. And in order that the Holy Spirit may
convince \[us\] of this, He said by the holy David, ‘The gods of the
nations, reputed gods, are idols of demons, and not gods;’ <span
id="fr_2120"></span>[2121](#fn_2120) and He denounces a curse on those
who worship them.”

<span id="viii.iv.lv-p5"></span>And I replied, “I would not bring
forward these proofs, Trypho, by which I am aware those who worship
these \[idols\] and such like are condemned, but such \[proofs\] as no
one could find any objection to. They will appear strange to you,
although you read them every day; so that even from this fact we <span
id="fr_2121"></span>[2122](#fn_2121) understand that, because of your
wickedness, God has withheld from you the ability to discern the wisdom
of His Scriptures; yet \[there are\] some exceptions, to whom, according
to the grace of His long-suffering, as Isaiah said, He has left a seed
of <span id="fr_2122"></span>[2123](#fn_2122) salvation, lest your race
be utterly destroyed, like Sodom and Gomorrah. Pay attention, therefore,
to what I shall record out of the holy Scriptures, which <span
id="fr_2123"></span>[2124](#fn_2123) do not need to be expounded, but
only listened to.

<span id="viii.iv.lv-p8"></span> Two constructions, “which” referring
either to Scriptures as whole, or to what he records from them. Last
more probable.
