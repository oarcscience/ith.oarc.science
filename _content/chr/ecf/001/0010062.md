### <span id="ii.ii.lvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LVII.—Let the authors of sedition submit themselves.

<span id="ii.ii.lvii-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.lvii-p1.1"></span>Ye
therefore, who laid the foundation of this sedition, submit yourselves
to the presbyters, and receive correction so as to repent, bending the
knees of your hearts. Learn to be subject, laying aside the proud and
arrogant self-confidence of your tongue. For it is better for you that
ye should occupy <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254) a humble but
honourable place in the flock of Christ, than that, being highly
exalted, ye should be cast out from the hope of His people. <span
id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255) For thus speaketh all-virtuous
Wisdom: <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256) “Behold, I will bring
forth to you the words of My Spirit, and I will teach you My speech.
Since I called, and ye did not hear; I held forth My words, and ye
regarded not, but set at naught My counsels, and yielded not at My
reproofs; therefore I too will laugh at your destruction; yea, I will
rejoice when ruin cometh upon you, and when sudden confusion overtakes
you, when overturning presents itself like a tempest, or when
tribulation and oppression fall upon you. For it shall come to pass,
that when ye call upon Me, I will not hear you; the wicked shall seek
Me, and they shall not find Me. For they hated wisdom, and did not
choose the fear of the Lord; nor would they listen to My counsels, but
despised My reproofs. Wherefore they shall eat the fruits of their own
way, and they shall be filled with their own ungodliness.” … <span

<span id="ii.ii.lvii-p2"></span> Literally, “to be found small and
esteemed.”

id="ii.ii.lvii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.lvii-p3"></span> Literally, “His hope.” \[It has been
conjectured that <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.ii.lvii-p3.1"></span>ἔλπιδος</span> should be <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.ii.lvii-p3.2"></span>ἔπαύλιδος</span>, and
the reading, “out of the fold of his people.” See Chevallier.\]

writers.\]

<span id="ii.ii.lvii-p5"></span> Junius (Pat. Young), who examined the
<span class="upper"><span id="ii.ii.lvii-p5.1"></span>ms.</span> before
it was bound into its present form, stated that a whole leaf was here
lost. The next letters that occur are <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.ii.lvii-p5.2"></span>ιπον</span>, which have been supposed to
indicate <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.ii.lvii-p5.3"></span>εἶπον</span> or <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.ii.lvii-p5.4"></span>ἔλιπον</span>. Doubtless some passages
quoted by the ancients from the Epistle of Clement, and not now found in
it, occurred in the portion which has thus been lost.
