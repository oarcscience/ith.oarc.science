<p> <a name="ix.ii.xxii"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="ix.ii.xxii-p0.1"></A>Chapter XXI.&#8212;The views of redemption entertained by these heretics.</h3>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xxii-p1"></A>1. <a name="ix.ii.xxii-p1.1"></A><a name="ix.ii.xxii-p1.2"></A>It happens that their tradition respecting <i>redemption</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2920"></A><A HREF="#fn_2920"><FONT SIZE="1">2921</FONT></A>
 is invisible and incomprehensible, as being the mother of things which are incomprehensible and invisible; and on this account, since it is fluctuating, it is impossible simply and all at once to make known its nature, for every one of them hands it down just as his own inclination prompts. Thus there are as many schemes of &#8220;redemption&#8221; as there are teachers of these mystical opinions. And when we come to refute them, we shall show in its fitting-place, that this class of men have been instigated by Satan to a denial of that baptism which is regeneration to God, and thus to a renunciation of the whole [Christian] faith.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xxii-p3"></A>2. They maintain that those who have attained to perfect knowledge must of necessity be regenerated into that power which is above all. For it is otherwise impossible to find admittance within the Pleroma, since this [regeneration] it is which leads them down into the depths of Bythus. For the baptism instituted by the visible Jesus was for the remission of sins, but the redemption brought in by that Christ who descended upon Him, was for perfection; and they allege that the former is animal, but the latter spiritual. And the baptism of John was proclaimed with a view to repentance, but the redemption by Jesus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2921"></A><A HREF="#fn_2921"><FONT SIZE="1">2922</FONT></A>
 was brought in for the sake of perfection. And to this He refers when He says, &#8220;And I have another baptism to be baptized with, and I hasten eagerly towards it.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2922"></A><A HREF="#fn_2922"><FONT SIZE="1">2923</FONT></A>
 Moreover, they affirm that the Lord added this redemption to the sons of Zebedee, when their mother asked that they might sit, the one on His right hand, and the other on His left, in His kingdom, saying, &#8220;Can ye be baptized with the baptism which I shall be baptized with?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2923"></A><A HREF="#fn_2923"><FONT SIZE="1">2924</FONT></A>
 Paul, too, they declare, has often set forth, in express terms, the redemption which is in Christ  <A NAME="page_346"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 346</FONT></A> <a name="ix.ii.xxii-Page_346"></A>  Jesus; and this was the same which is handed down by them in so varied and discordant forms.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xxii-p7"></A>3. <a name="ix.ii.xxii-p7.1"></A><a name="ix.ii.xxii-p7.2"></A>For some of them prepare a nuptial couch, and perform a sort of mystic rite (pronouncing certain expressions) with those who are being initiated, and affirm that it is a spiritual marriage which is celebrated by them, after the likeness of the conjunctions above. Others, again, lead them to a place where water is, and baptize them, with the utterance of these words, &#8220;Into the name of the unknown Father of the universe&#8212; into truth, the mother of all things&#8212;into Him who descended on Jesus&#8212;into union, and redemption, and communion with the powers.&#8221; Others still repeat certain Hebrew words, in order the more thoroughly to bewilder those who are being initiated, as follows: &#8220;Basema, Chamosse, Ba&#339;naora, Mistadia, Ruada, Kousta, Babaphor, Kalachthei.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2924"></A><A HREF="#fn_2924"><FONT SIZE="1">2925</FONT></A>
 The interpretation of these terms runs thus: &#8220;I invoke that which is above every power of the Father, which is called light, and good Spirit, and life, because Thou hast reigned in the body.&#8221; Others, again, set forth the redemption thus: The name which is hidden from every deity, and dominion, and truth which Jesus of Nazareth was clothed with in the lives&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2925"></A><A HREF="#fn_2925"><FONT SIZE="1">2926</FONT></A>
 of the light of Christ&#8212;of Christ, who lives by the Holy Ghost, for the angelic redemption. The name of restitution stands thus: Messia, Uphareg, Namemps&#339;man, Chald&#339;aur, Mosomed&#339;a, Acphran&#339;, Psaua, Jesus Nazaria.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2926"></A><A HREF="#fn_2926"><FONT SIZE="1">2927</FONT></A>
 The interpretation of these words is as follows: &#8220;I do not divide the Spirit of Christ, neither the heart nor the supercelestial power which is merciful; may I enjoy Thy name, O Saviour of truth!&#8221; Such are words of the initiators; but he who is initiated, replies, &#8220;I am established, and I am redeemed; I redeem my soul from this age (world), and from all things connected with it in the name of Iao, who redeemed his own soul into redemption in Christ who liveth.&#8221; Then the bystanders add these words, &#8220;Peace be to all on whom this name rests.&#8221; After this they anoint the initiated person with balsam; for they assert that this unguent is a type of that sweet odour which is above all things.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xxii-p11"></A>4. But there are some of them who assert that it is superfluous to bring persons to the water, but mixing oil and water together, they place this mixture on the heads of those who are to be initiated, with the use of some such expressions as we have already mentioned. And this they maintain to be the redemption. They, too, are accustomed to anoint with balsam. Others, however, reject all these practices, and maintain that the mystery of the unspeakable and invisible power ought not to be performed by visible and corruptible creatures, nor should that of those [beings] who are inconceivable, and incorporeal, and beyond the reach of sense, [be performed] by such as are the objects of sense, and possessed of a body. These hold that the knowledge of the unspeakable Greatness is itself perfect redemption. For since both defect and passion flowed from ignorance, the whole substance of what was thus formed is destroyed by knowledge; and therefore knowledge is the redemption of the inner man. This, however, is not of a corporeal nature, for the body is corruptible; nor is it animal, since the animal soul is the fruit of a defect, and is, as it were, the abode of the spirit. The redemption must therefore be of a spiritual nature; for they affirm that the inner and spiritual man is redeemed by means of knowledge, and that they, having acquired the knowledge of all things, stand thenceforth in need of nothing else. This, then, is the true redemption.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xxii-p12"></A>5. Others still there are who continue to redeem persons even up to the moment of death, by placing on their heads oil and water, or the pre-mentioned ointment with water, using at the same time the above-named invocations, that the persons referred to may become incapable of being seized or seen by the principalities and powers, and that their inner man may ascend on high in an invisible manner, as if their body were left among created things in this world, while their soul is sent forward to the Demiurge. And they instruct them, on their reaching the principalities and powers, to make use of these words: &#8220;I am a son from the Father&#8212;the Father who had a pre-existence, and a son in Him who is pre-existent. I have come to behold all things, both those which belong to myself and others, although, strictly speaking, they do not belong to others, but to Achamoth, who is female in nature, and made these things for herself. For I derive being from Him who is pre-existent, and I come again to my own place whence I went forth.&#8221; And they affirm that, by saying these things, he escapes from the powers. He then advances to the companions of the Demiurge, and thus addresses them:&#8212;&#8220;I am a vessel more precious than the female who formed you. If your mother is ignorant of her own descent, I know myself, and am aware whence I am, and I call upon the incorruptible Sophia, who is in the Father, and is the mother of your mother, who has no father, nor any male consort; but a female springing from a female formed you, while ignorant of her own mother, and imagining that she alone existed; but I call upon her mother.&#8221; And they declare, that when the companions of the Demiurge hear these words, they are greatly agitated, and upbraid their origin and the race of their mother. But he goes into his own place, having  <A NAME="page_347"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 347</FONT></A> <a name="ix.ii.xxii-Page_347"></A>  thrown [off] his chain, that is, his animal nature. These, then, are the particulars which have reached us respecting &#8220;redemption.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2927"></A><A HREF="#fn_2927"><FONT SIZE="1">2928</FONT></A>
 But since they differ so widely among themselves both as respects doctrine and tradition, and since those of them who are recognised as being most modern make it their effort daily to invent some new opinion, and to bring out what no one ever before thought of, it is a difficult matter to describe all their opinions.</p>
