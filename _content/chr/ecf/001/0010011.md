### <span id="ii.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Continuation. Several other martyrs.

<span id="ii.ii.vi-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.vi-p1.1"></span>To these
men who spent their lives in the practice of holiness, there is to be
added a great multitude of the elect, who, having through envy endured
many indignities and tortures, furnished us with a most excellent
example. <span id="ii.ii.vi-p1.2"></span><span
id="ii.ii.vi-p1.3"></span>Through envy, those women, the Danaids <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31) and Dircæ, being persecuted, after they
had suffered terrible and unspeakable torments, finished the course of
their faith with stedfastness, <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32) and
though weak in body, received a noble reward. Envy has alienated wives
from their husbands, and changed that saying of our father Adam, “This
is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.” <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33) Envy and strife have overthrown great
cities and rooted up mighty nations.

<span id="ii.ii.vi-p2"></span> Some suppose these to have been the names
of two eminent female martyrs under Nero; others regard the clause as an
interpolation. \[Many ingenious conjectures might be cited; but see
Jacobson’s valuable note, *Patres Apostol.*, vol. i. p. 30.\]

<span id="ii.ii.vi-p3"></span> Literally, “have reached to the stedfast
course of faith.”
