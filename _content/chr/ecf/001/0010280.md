### <span id="v.xvi.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—Cautions against false teachers.

<span id="v.xvi.ii-p1"></span>Every one that teaches anything beyond
what is commanded, though he be \[deemed\] worthy of credit, though he
be in the habit of fasting, though he live in continence, though he work
miracles, though he have the gift of prophecy, let him be in thy sight
as a wolf in sheep’s clothing, <span
id="fr_1275"></span>[1276](#fn_1275) labouring for the destruction of
the sheep. If any one denies the cross, and is ashamed of the passion,
let him be to thee as the adversary himself. “Though he gives all his
goods to feed the poor, though he remove mountains, though he give his
body to be burned,” <span id="fr_1276"></span>[1277](#fn_1276) let him
be regarded by thee as abominable. If any one makes light of the law or
the prophets, which Christ fulfilled at His coming, let him be to thee
as antichrist. If any one says that the Lord is a mere man, he is a Jew,
a murderer of Christ.
