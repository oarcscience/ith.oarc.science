<p> <a name="viii.iv.vi"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.iv.vi-p0.1"></A>Chapter VI.&#8212;These things were unknown to Plato and other philosophers.</h3>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.vi-p1"></A>&#8220; &#145;It makes no matter to me,&#146; said he, &#145;whether Plato or Pythagoras, or, in short, any other man held such opinions. For the truth is so; and you would perceive it from this. <a name="viii.iv.vi-p1.1"></A>The soul assuredly is or has life. If, then, it is life, it would cause something else, and not itself, to live, even as motion would move something else than itself. Now, that the soul lives, no one would deny. But if it lives, it lives not as being life, but as the partaker of life; but that which partakes of anything, is different from that of which it does partake. Now the soul partakes of life, since God wills it to live. Thus, then, it will not even partake [of life] when God does not will it to live. <a name="viii.iv.vi-p1.2"></A>For to live is not its attribute, as it is God&#146;s; but as a man does not live always, and the soul is not for ever conjoined with the body, since, whenever this harmony must be broken up, the soul leaves the body, and the man exists no longer; even so, whenever the soul must cease to exist, the spirit of life is removed from it, and there is no more soul, but it goes back to the place from whence it was taken.&#146;</p>
