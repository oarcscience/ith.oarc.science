For even among yourselves, as we said before,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1886"></A><A HREF="#fn_1886"><FONT SIZE="1">1887</FONT></A>
 Simon was in the royal city Rome in the reign of Claudius C&aelig;sar, and so greatly astonished the sacred senate and people of the Romans, that he was considered a god, and honoured, like the others whom you honour as gods, with a statue. Wherefore we pray that the sacred senate and your people may, along with yourselves, be arbiters of this our memorial, in order that if any one be entangled by that man&#146;s doctrines, he may learn the truth, and so be able to escape error; and as for the statue, if you please, destroy it.</p>
