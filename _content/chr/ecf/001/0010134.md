### <span id="v.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—An exhortation to fear God, etc.

<span id="v.ii.xi-p1"></span><span id="v.ii.xi-p1.1"></span>The last
times are come upon us. <span id="v.ii.xi-p1.2"></span>Let us therefore
be of a reverent spirit, and fear the long-suffering of God, that it
tend not to our condemnation. For let us either stand in awe of the
wrath to come, or show regard for the grace which is at present
displayed— one of two things. Only \[in one way or another\] let us be
found in Christ Jesus unto the true life. <span
id="v.ii.xi-p1.3"></span>Apart from Him, let nothing attract <span
id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567) you, for whom I bear about these
bonds, these spiritual jewels, by which may I arise through your
prayers, of which I entreat I may always be a partaker, that I may be
found in the lot of the Christians of Ephesus, who have always been of
the same mind with the apostles through the power of Jesus Christ.

<span id="v.ii.xi-p3"></span><span id="v.ii.xi-p3.1"></span>The last
times are come upon us. <span id="v.ii.xi-p3.2"></span>Let us therefore
be of a reverent spirit, and fear the long-suffering of God, lest we
despise the riches of His goodness and forbearance. <span
id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568) For let us either fear the wrath to
come, or let us love the present joy in the life that now is; and let
our present and true joy be only this, to be found in Christ Jesus, that
we may truly live. Do not at any time desire so much as even to breathe
apart from Him. <span id="v.ii.xi-p4.2"></span>For He is my hope; He is
my boast; He is my never-failing riches, on whose account I bear about
with me these bonds from Syria to Rome, these spiritual jewels, in which
may I be perfected through your prayers, and become a partaker of the
sufferings of Christ, and have fellowship with Him in His death, His
resurrection from the dead, and His everlasting life. <span
id="fr_569"></span>[570](#fn_569) May I attain to this, so that I may be
found in the lot of the Christians of Ephesus, who have always had
intercourse with the apostles by the power of Jesus Christ, with Paul,
and John, and Timothy the most faithful.
