### <span id="viii.viii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—If the members rise, must they discharge the same functions as now?

<span id="viii.viii.iii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.viii.iii-p1.1"></span>They say, then, if the body shall rise
entire, and in possession of all its members, it necessarily follows
that the functions of the members shall also be in existence; that the
womb shall become pregnant, and the male also discharge his function of
generation, and the rest of the members in like manner. Now let this
argument stand or fall by this one assertion. For this being proved
false, their whole objection will be removed. Now it is indeed evident
that the members which discharge functions discharge those functions
which in the present life we see but it does not follow that they
necessarily discharge the same functions from the beginning. And that
this may be more clearly seen, let us consider it thus. The function of
the womb is to become pregnant; and of the member of the male to
impregnate. But as, though these members are destined to discharge such
functions, it is not therefore necessary that they from the beginning
discharge them (since we see many women who do not become pregnant, as
those that are barren, even though they have wombs), so pregnancy is not
the immediate and necessary consequence of having a womb; but those even
who are not barren abstain from sexual intercourse, some being virgins
from the first, and others from a certain time. And we see men also
keeping themselves virgins, some from the first, and some from a certain
time; so that by their means, marriage, made lawless through lust, is
destroyed. <span id="fr_2614"></span>[2615](#fn_2614) And we find that
some even of the lower animals, though possessed of wombs, do not bear,
such as the mule; and the male mules do not beget their kind. So that
both in the case of men and the irrational animals we can see sexual
intercourse abolished; and this, too, before the future world. And our
Lord Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, for no other reason than that He
might destroy the begetting by lawless desire, and might show to the
ruler <span id="fr_2615"></span>[2616](#fn_2615) that the formation of
man was possible to God without human intervention. And when He had been
born, and had submitted to the other conditions of the flesh,—I mean
food, drink, and clothing,—this one condition only of discharging the
sexual function He did not submit to; for, regarding the desires of the
flesh, He accepted some as necessary, while others, which were
unnecessary, He did not submit to. For if the flesh were deprived of
food, drink, and clothing, it would be destroyed; but being deprived of
lawless desire, it suffers no harm. And at the same time He foretold
that, in the future world, sexual intercourse should be done away with;
as He says, “The children of this world marry, and are given in
marriage; but the children of the world to come neither marry nor are
given in marriage, but shall be like the angels in heaven.” <span
id="fr_2616"></span>[2617](#fn_2616) Let not, then, those that are
unbelieving marvel, if in the world to come He do away with those acts
of our fleshly members which even in this present life are abolished.

of begetting children.
