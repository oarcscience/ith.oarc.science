### <span id="viii.xi.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Sentence pronounced and executed.

<span id="viii.xi.v-p1"></span>Rusticus the prefect pronounced sentence,
saying, “Let those who have refused to sacrifice to the gods and to
yield to the command of the emperor be scourged, <span
id="fr_2647"></span>[2648](#fn_2647) and led away to suffer the
punishment of decapitation, according to the laws.” The holy martyrs
having glorified God, and having gone forth to the accustomed place,
were beheaded, and perfected their testimony in the confession of the
Saviour. And some of the faithful having secretly removed their bodies,
laid them in a suitable place, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ having
wrought along with them, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

<span id="viii.xi.v-p2"></span> \[This wholesale sentence implies a
great indifference to the probable Roman citizenship of some of them, if
not our heroic martyr himself; but [Acts xxii.
25-29](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#025)<span id="viii.xi.v-p2.1"></span>
seems to allow that the condemned were not protected by the law.\]
