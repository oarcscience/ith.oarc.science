<span id="viii.iv.lxxvi"></span>

### <span id="viii.iv.lxxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXXVI.—From other passages the same majesty and government of Christ are proved.

<span id="viii.iv.lxxvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxvi-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxvi-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.iv.lxxvi-p1.3"></span>“For
when Daniel speaks of ‘one like unto the Son of man’ who received the
everlasting kingdom, does he not hint at this very thing? For he
declares that, in saying ‘like unto the Son of man,’ He appeared, and
was man, but not of human seed. And the same thing he proclaimed in
mystery when he speaks of this stone which was cut out without hands.
For the expression ‘it was cut out without hands’ signified that it is
not a work of man, but \[a work\] of the will of the Father and God of
all things, who brought Him forth. <span
id="viii.iv.lxxvi-p1.4"></span>And when Isaiah says, ‘Who shall declare
His generation?’ he meant that His descent could not be declared. Now no
one who is a man of men has a descent that cannot be declared. And when
Moses says that He will wash His garments in the blood of the grape,
does not this signify what I have now often told you is an obscure
prediction, namely, that He had blood, but not from men; just as not
man, but God, has begotten the blood of the vine? And when Isaiah calls
Him the Angel of mighty counsel, <span
id="fr_2233"></span>[2234](#fn_2233) did he not foretell Him to be the
Teacher of those truths which He did teach when He came \[to earth\]?
For He alone taught openly those mighty counsels which the Father
designed both for all those who have been and shall be well-pleasing to
Him, and also for those who have rebelled against His will, whether men
or angels, when He said: ‘They shall come from the east \[and from the
west <span id="fr_2234"></span>[2235](#fn_2234) \], and shall sit down
with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: but the
children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness.’ <span
id="fr_2235"></span>[2236](#fn_2235) And, ‘Many shall say to Me in that
day, Lord, Lord, have we not eaten, and drunk, and prophesied, and cast
out demons in Thy name? And I will say to them, Depart from Me.’ <span
id="fr_2236"></span>[2237](#fn_2236) Again, in other words, by which He
shall condemn those who are unworthy of salvation, He said, ‘Depart into
outer darkness, which the Father has prepared for Satan and his,
angels.’ <span id="fr_2237"></span>[2238](#fn_2237) And again, in other
words, He said, ‘I give unto you power to tread on serpents, and on
scorpions, and on *scolopendras*, and on all the might of the
enemy.’ <span id="fr_2238"></span>[2239](#fn_2238) And now we, who
believe on our Lord Jesus, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, when
we exorcise all demons and evil spirits, have them subjected to us. For
if the prophets declared obscurely that Christ would suffer, and
thereafter be Lord of all, yet that \[declaration\] could not be
understood by any man until He Himself persuaded the apostles that such
statements were expressly related in the Scriptures. For He exclaimed
before His crucifixion: ‘The Son of man must suffer many <span
id="page_237">p. 237</span> <span id="viii.iv.lxxvi-Page_237"></span>
things, and be rejected by the Scribes and Pharisees, and be crucified,
and on the third day rise again.’ <span
id="fr_2239"></span>[2240](#fn_2239) And David predicted that He would
be born from the womb before sun and moon, <span
id="fr_2240"></span>[2241](#fn_2240) according to the Father’s will, and
made Him known, being Christ, as God strong and to be worshipped.”
