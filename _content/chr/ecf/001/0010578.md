### <span id="viii.iv.cxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXVII.—Malachi’s prophecy concerning the sacrifices of the Christians. It cannot be taken as referring to the prayers of Jews of the dispersion.

<span id="viii.iv.cxvii-p1"></span>“Accordingly, God, anticipating all
the sacrifices which we offer through this name, and which Jesus the
Christ enjoined us to offer, i.e., in the Eucharist of the bread and the
cup, and which are presented by Christians in all places throughout the
world, bears witness that they are well-pleasing to Him. But He utterly
rejects those presented by you and by those priests of yours, saying,
‘And I will not accept your sacrifices at your hands; for from the
rising of the sun to its setting my name is glorified among the Gentiles
(He says); but ye profane it.’ <span
id="fr_2388"></span>[2389](#fn_2388) <span
id="viii.iv.cxvii-p2.2"></span>Yet even now, in your love of contention,
you assert that God does not accept the sacrifices of those who dwelt
then in Jerusalem, and were called Israelites; but says that He is
pleased with the prayers of the individuals of that nation then
dispersed, and calls their prayers sacrifices. Now, that prayers and
giving of thanks, when offered by worthy men, are the only perfect and
well-pleasing sacrifices to God, I also admit. For such alone Christians
have undertaken to offer, and in the remembrance effected by their solid
and liquid food, whereby the suffering of the Son of God <span
id="fr_2389"></span>[2390](#fn_2389) which He endured is brought to
mind, whose name the high priests of your nation and your teachers have
caused to be profaned and blasphemed over all the earth. But these
filthy garments, which have been put by you on all who have become
Christians by the name of Jesus, God shows shall be taken away from us,
when He shall raise all men from the dead, and appoint some to be
incorruptible, immortal, and free from sorrow in the everlasting and
imperishable kingdom; but shall send others away to the everlasting
punishment of fire. But as to you and your teachers deceiving yourselves
when you interpret what the Scripture says as referring to <span
id="page_258">p. 258</span> <span id="viii.iv.cxvii-Page_258"></span>
those of your nation then in dispersion, and maintain that their prayers
and sacrifices offered in every place are pure and well-pleasing, learn
that you are speaking falsely, and trying by all means to cheat
yourselves: for, first of all, not even now does your nation extend from
the rising to the setting of the sun, but there are nations among which
none of your race ever dwelt. For there is not one single race of men,
whether barbarians, or Greeks, or whatever they may be called, nomads,
or vagrants, or herdsmen living in tents, among whom prayers and giving
of thanks are not offered through the name of the crucified Jesus. <span
id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390) And then, <span
id="fr_2391"></span>[2392](#fn_2391) as the Scriptures show, at the time
when Malachi wrote this, your dispersion over all the earth, which now
exists, had not taken place.
