<p> <a name="viii.iv.cxxii"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.iv.cxxii-p0.1"></A>Chapter CXXII.&#8212;The Jews understand this of the proselytes without reason.</h3>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.cxxii-p1"></A>&#8220;You think that these words refer to the stranger&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2416"></A><A HREF="#fn_2416"><FONT SIZE="1">2417</FONT></A>
 and the proselytes, but in fact they refer to us who have been illumined by Jesus. For Christ would have borne witness even to them; but now you are become twofold more the children of hell, as He said Himself.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2417"></A><A HREF="#fn_2417"><FONT SIZE="1">2418</FONT></A>
 Therefore what was written by the prophets was spoken not of those persons, but of us, concerning whom the Scripture speaks: &#145;I will lead the blind by a way which they knew not; and they shall walk in paths which they have not known. And I am witness, saith the Lord God, and my servant whom I have chosen.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2418"></A><A HREF="#fn_2418"><FONT SIZE="1">2419</FONT></A>
 To whom, then, does Christ bear witness? Manifestly to those who have believed. But the proselytes not only do not believe, but twofold more than yourselves blaspheme His name, and wish to torture and put to death us who believe in Him; for in all points they strive to be like you. And again in other words He cries: &#145;I the Lord have called Thee in righteousness, and will hold Thine hand, and will strengthen Thee, and will give Thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out the prisoners from their bonds.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2419"></A><A HREF="#fn_2419"><FONT SIZE="1">2420</FONT></A>
 These words, indeed, sirs, refer also to Christ, and concern the enlightened nations; or will you say again, He speaks to them of the law and the proselytes?&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.cxxii-p6"></A>Then some of those who had come on the second day cried out as if they had been in a theatre, &#8220;But what? does He not refer to the law, and to those illumined by it? Now these are proselytes.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.cxxii-p7"></A>&#8220;No,&#8221; I said, looking towards Trypho, &#8220;since, if the law were able to enlighten the nations and those who possess it, what need is there of a new covenant? But since God announced beforehand that He would send a new covenant, and an everlasting law and commandment, we will not understand this of the old law and its proselytes, but of Christ and His proselytes, namely us Gentiles, whom He has illumined, as He says somewhere: &#145;Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard Thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped Thee, and I have given Thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, and to inherit the deserted.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2420"></A><A HREF="#fn_2420"><FONT SIZE="1">2421</FONT></A>
 What, then, is Christ&#146;s inheritance? Is it not the nations? What is the covenant of God? Is it not  <A NAME="page_261"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 261</FONT></A> <a name="viii.iv.cxxii-Page_261"></A>  Christ? As He says in another place: &#145;Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of Me, and I shall give Thee the nations for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2421"></A><A HREF="#fn_2421"><FONT SIZE="1">2422</FONT></A>
