### <span id="ii.ii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—The peace and harmony of the universe.

<span id="ii.ii.xx-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xx-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xx-p1.2"></span>The heavens, revolving under His government,
are subject to Him in peace. Day and night run the course appointed by
Him, in no wise hindering each other. The sun and moon, with the
companies of the stars, roll on in harmony according to His command,
within their prescribed limits, and without any deviation. The fruitful
earth, according to His will, brings forth food in abundance, at the
proper seasons, for man and beast and all the living beings upon it,
never hesitating, nor changing any of the ordinances which He has fixed.
The unsearchable places of abysses, and the indescribable arrangements
of the lower world, are restrained by the same laws. The vast
unmeasurable sea, gathered together by His working into various
basins, <span id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86) never passes beyond the
bounds placed around it, but does as He has commanded. For He said,
“Thus far shalt thou come, and thy waves shall be broken within
thee.” <span id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87) The ocean, impassable to
man, and the worlds beyond it, are regulated by the same enactments of
the Lord. The seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, peacefully
give place to one another. The winds in their several quarters <span
id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88) fulfil, at the proper time, their service
without hindrance. The ever-flowing fountains, formed both for enjoyment
and health, furnish without fail their breasts for the life of men. The
very smallest <span id="page_11">p. 11</span> <span
id="ii.ii.xx-Page_11"></span> of living beings meet together in peace
and concord. All these the great Creator and Lord of all has appointed
to exist in peace and harmony; while He does good to all, but most
abundantly to us who have fled for refuge to His compassions through
Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be glory and majesty for ever and ever.
Amen.
