### <span id="viii.ii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Heathen analogies to Christian doctrine.

<span id="viii.ii.xx-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii.xx-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xx-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.ii.xx-p1.3"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xx-p1.4"></span>And the Sibyl <span
id="fr_1810"></span>[1811](#fn_1810) and Hystaspes said that there
should be a dissolution by God of things corruptible. <span
id="viii.ii.xx-p2.1"></span>And the philosophers called Stoics teach
that even God Himself shall be resolved into fire, and they say that the
world is to be formed anew by this revolution; but we understand that
God, the Creator of all things, is superior to the things that are to be
changed. If, therefore, on some points we teach the same things as the
poets and philosophers whom you honour, and on other points are fuller
and more divine in our teaching, and if we alone afford proof of what we
assert, why are we unjustly hated more than all others? <span
id="viii.ii.xx-p2.2"></span>For while we say that all things have been
produced and arranged into a world by God, we shall seem to utter the
doctrine of <span id="page_170">p. 170</span> <span
id="viii.ii.xx-Page_170"></span> Plato; and while we say that there will
be a burning up of all, we shall seem to utter the doctrine of the
Stoics: and while we affirm that the souls of the wicked, being endowed
with sensation even after death, are punished, and that those of the
good being delivered from punishment spend a blessed existence, we shall
seem to say the same things as the poets and philosophers; and while we
maintain that men ought not to worship the works of their hands, we say
the very things which have been said by the comic poet Menander, and
other similar writers, for they have declared that the workman is
greater than the work.

<span id="viii.ii.xx-p2"></span> The Sibylline Oracles are now generally
regarded as heathen fragments largely interpolated by unscrupulous men
during the early ages of the Church. For an interesting account of these
somewhat perplexing documents, see Burton’s *Lectures on the
Ecclesiastical History of the First Three Centuries*, Lect. xvii. The
prophecies of Hystaspes were also commonly appealed to as genuine by the
early Christians. \[See (on the Sibyls and Justin M.) Casaubon,
*Exercitationes*, pp. 65 and 80. This work is a most learned and
diversified *thesaurus*, in the form of strictures on Card. Baronius.
Geneva, 1663.\]
