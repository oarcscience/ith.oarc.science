<p> <a name="ix.ii.vii"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="ix.ii.vii-p0.1"></A>Chapter VI.&#8212;The threefold kind of man feigned by these heretics: good works needless for them, though necessary to others: their abandoned morals.</h3>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.vii-p1"></A>1. <a name="ix.ii.vii-p1.1"></A><a name="ix.ii.vii-p1.2"></A>There being thus three kinds of substances, they declare of all that is material (which they also describe as being &#8220;on the left hand&#8221;) that it must of necessity perish, inasmuch as it is incapable of receiving any <i>afflatus</i> of incorruption. As to every animal existence (which they also denominate &#8220;on the right hand&#8221;), they hold that, inasmuch as it is a mean between the spiritual and the material, it passes to the side to  <A NAME="page_324"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 324</FONT></A> <a name="ix.ii.vii-Page_324"></A>  which inclination draws it. Spiritual substance, again, they describe as having been sent forth for this end, that, being here united with that which is animal, it might assume shape, the two elements being simultaneously subjected to the same discipline. And this they declare to be &#8220;the salt&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2733"></A><A HREF="#fn_2733"><FONT SIZE="1">2734</FONT></A>
 and &#8220;the light of the world.&#8221; For the animal substance had need of training by means of the outward senses; and on this account they affirm that the world was created, as well as that the Saviour came to the animal substance (which was possessed of free-will), that He might secure for it salvation. For they affirm that He received the first-fruits of those whom He was to save [as follows], from Achamoth that which was spiritual, while He was invested by the Demiurge with the animal Christ, but was begirt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2734"></A><A HREF="#fn_2734"><FONT SIZE="1">2735</FONT></A>
 by a [special] dispensation with a body endowed with an animal nature, yet constructed with unspeakable skill, so that it might be visible and tangible, and capable of enduring suffering. At the same time, they deny that He assumed anything material [into His nature], since indeed matter is incapable of salvation. They further hold that the consummation of all things will take place when all that is spiritual has been formed and perfected by Gnosis (knowledge); and by this they mean spiritual men who have attained to the perfect knowledge of God, and been initiated into these mysteries by Achamoth. And they represent themselves to be these persons.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.vii-p4"></A>2. Animal men, again, are instructed in animal things; such men, namely, as are established by their works, and by a mere faith, while they have not perfect knowledge. We of the Church, they say, are these persons.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2735"></A><A HREF="#fn_2735"><FONT SIZE="1">2736</FONT></A>
 Wherefore also they maintain that good works are necessary to us, for that otherwise it is impossible we should be saved. <a name="ix.ii.vii-p5.2"></A>But as to themselves, they hold that they shall be entirely and undoubtedly saved, not by means of conduct, but because they are spiritual by nature.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2736"></A><A HREF="#fn_2736"><FONT SIZE="1">2737</FONT></A>
 For, just as it is impossible that material substance should partake of salvation (since, indeed, they maintain that it is incapable of receiving it), so again it is impossible that spiritual substance (by which they mean themselves) should ever come under the power of corruption, whatever the sort of actions in which they indulged. For even as gold, when submersed in filth, loses not on that account its beauty, but retains its own native qualities, the filth having no power to injure the gold, so they affirm that they cannot in any measure suffer hurt, or lose their spiritual substance, whatever the material actions in which they may be involved.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.vii-p7"></A>3. <a name="ix.ii.vii-p7.1"></A><a name="ix.ii.vii-p7.2"></A><a name="ix.ii.vii-p7.3"></A>Wherefore also it comes to pass, that the &#8220;most perfect&#8221; among them addict themselves without fear to all those kinds of forbidden deeds of which the Scriptures assure us that &#8220;they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2737"></A><A HREF="#fn_2737"><FONT SIZE="1">2738</FONT></A>
 For instance, they make no scruple about eating meats offered in sacrifice to idols, imagining that they can in this way contract no defilement. Then, again, at every heathen festival celebrated in honour of the idols, these men are the first to assemble; and to such a pitch do they go, that some of them do not even keep away from that bloody spectacle hateful both to God and men, in which gladiators either fight with wild beasts, or singly encounter one another. Others of them yield themselves up to the lusts of the flesh with the utmost greediness, maintaining that carnal things should be allowed to the carnal nature, while spiritual things are provided for the spiritual. Some of them, moreover, are in the habit of defiling those women to whom they have taught the above doctrine, as has frequently been confessed by those women who have been led astray by certain of them, on their returning to the Church of God, and acknowledging this along with the rest of their errors. Others of them, too, openly and without a blush, having become passionately attached to certain women, seduce them away from their husbands, and contract marriages of their own with them. Others of them, again, who pretend at first to live in all modesty with them as with sisters, have in course of time been revealed in their true colours, when the sister has been found with child by her [pretended] brother.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.vii-p9"></A>4. And committing many other abominations and impieties, they run us down (who from the fear of God guard against sinning even in thought or word) as utterly contemptible and ignorant persons, while they highly exalt themselves, and claim to be perfect, and the elect seed. For they declare that we simply receive grace for use, wherefore also it will again be taken away from us; but that they themselves have grace as their own special possession, which has descended from above by means of an unspeakable and indescribable conjunction; and on this account more will be given them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2738"></A><A HREF="#fn_2738"><FONT SIZE="1">2739</FONT></A>
 They maintain, therefore, that in every way it is always necessary for them to practise the mystery of conjunction. And that they may persuade the thoughtless to believe this, they are in the habit of using these very words, &#8220;Whosoever being <i>in</i> this world does not so love a woman as to  <A NAME="page_325"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 325</FONT></A> <a name="ix.ii.vii-Page_325"></A>  obtain possession of her, is not of the truth, nor shall attain to the truth. But whosoever being <i>of</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2739"></A><A HREF="#fn_2739"><FONT SIZE="1">2740</FONT></A>
 this world has intercourse with woman, shall not attain to the truth, because he has so acted under the power of concupiscence.&#8221; <a name="ix.ii.vii-p11.2"></A>On this account, they tell us that it is necessary for us whom they call <i>animal</i> men, and describe as being <i>of</i> the world, to practise continence and good works, that by this means we may attain at length to the intermediate habitation, but that to them who are called &#8220;the spiritual and perfect&#8221; such a course of conduct is not at all necessary. For it is not conduct of any kind which leads into the Pleroma, but the seed sent forth thence in a feeble, immature state, and here brought to perfection.</p>
