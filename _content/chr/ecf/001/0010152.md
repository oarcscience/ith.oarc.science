### <span id="v.iii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Preserve harmony.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p1"></span><span id="v.iii.vi-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.iii.vi-p1.2"></span><span id="v.iii.vi-p1.3"></span>Since
therefore I have, in the persons before mentioned, beheld the whole
multitude of you in faith and love, I exhort you to study to do all
things with a divine harmony, <span id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666)
while your bishop presides in the place of God, and your presbyters in
the place of the assembly of the apostles, along with your deacons, who
are most dear to me, and are entrusted with the ministry of Jesus
Christ, who was with the Father before the beginning of time, <span
id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667) and in the end was revealed. Do ye all
then, imitating the same divine conduct, <span
id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668) pay respect to one another, and let no
one look upon his neighbour after the flesh, but do ye continually love
each other in Jesus Christ. Let nothing exist among you that may divide
you; but be ye united with your bishop, and those that preside over you,
as a type and evidence of your immortality. <span
id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669)

<span id="v.iii.vi-p6"></span><span id="v.iii.vi-p6.1"></span><span
id="v.iii.vi-p6.2"></span><span id="v.iii.vi-p6.3"></span>Since
therefore I have, in the persons before mentioned, beheld the whole
multitude of you in faith and love, I exhort you to study to do all
things with a divine harmony, <span id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670)
while your bishop presides in the place of God, and your presbyters in
the place of the assembly of the apostles, along with your deacons, who
are most dear to me, and are entrusted with the ministry of Jesus
Christ. <span id="v.iii.vi-p7.1"></span>He, being begotten by the Father
before the beginning of time, <span id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671)
was God the Word, the only-begotten Son, and remains the same for ever;
for “of His kingdom there shall be no end,” <span
id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672) says Daniel the prophet. Let us all
therefore love one another in harmony, and let no one look upon his
neighbour according to the flesh, but in Christ Jesus. Let nothing exist
among you which may divide you; but be ye united with your bishop, being
through him subject to God in Christ.
