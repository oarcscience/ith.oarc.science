### <span id="viii.ii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Analogies to the history of Christ.

<span id="viii.ii.xxi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xxi-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.xxi-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xxi-p1.3"></span><span id="viii.ii.xxi-p1.4"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xxi-p1.5"></span>And when we say also that the Word, who is
the first-birth <span id="fr_1811"></span>[1812](#fn_1811) of God, was
produced without sexual union, and that He, Jesus Christ, our Teacher,
was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we
propound nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom
you esteem sons of Jupiter. For you know how many sons your esteemed
writers ascribed to Jupiter: Mercury, the interpreting word and teacher
of all; Æsculapius, who, though he was a great physician, was struck by
a thunderbolt, and so ascended to heaven; and Bacchus too, after he had
been torn limb from limb; and Hercules, when he had committed himself to
the flames to escape his toils; and the sons of Leda, and Dioscuri; and
Perseus, son of Danae; and Bellerophon, who, though sprung from mortals,
rose to heaven on the horse Pegasus. For what shall I say of Ariadne,
and those who, like her, have been declared to be set among the stars?
And what of the emperors who die among yourselves, whom you deem worthy
of deification, and in whose behalf you produce some one who swears he
has seen the burning Cæsar rise to heaven from the funeral pyre? And
what kind of deeds are recorded of each of these reputed sons of
Jupiter, it is needless to tell to those who already know. This only
shall be said, that they are written for the advantage and
encouragement <span id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812) of youthful
scholars; for all reckon it an honourable thing to imitate the gods. But
far be such a thought concerning the gods from every well-conditioned
soul, as to believe that Jupiter himself, the governor and creator of
all things, was both a parricide and the son of a parricide, and that
being overcome by the love of base and shameful pleasures, he came in to
Ganymede and those many women whom he had violated and that his sons did
like actions. But, as we said above, wicked devils perpetrated these
things. And we have learned that those only are deified who have lived
near to God in holiness and virtue; and we believe that those who live
wickedly and do not repent are punished in everlasting fire.

<span id="viii.ii.xxi-p3"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.xxi-p3.1"></span>διαφορὰν καὶ προτροπήν</span>. The irony
here is so obvious as to make the proposed reading (<span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.xxi-p3.2"></span>διαφθορὰν καὶ
παρατροπήν</span>, corruption and depravation) unnecessary. Otto prefers
the reading adopted above. Trollope, on the other hand, inclines to the
latter reading, mainly on the score of the former expressions being
unusual. See his very sensible note *in loc*.
