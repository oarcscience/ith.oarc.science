<p> <a name="v.ii.xv"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="v.ii.xv-p0.1"></A>Chapter XV.&#8212;Exhortation to confess Christ by silence as well as speech.</h3>  
<p><a name="v.ii.xv-p1"></A><a name="v.ii.xv-p1.1"></A><a name="v.ii.xv-p1.2"></A>It is better for a man to be silent and be [a Christian], than to talk and not to be one. It is good to teach, if he who speaks also acts. There is then one Teacher, who spake and it was done; while even those things which He did in silence are worthy of  <A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A> <a name="v.ii.xv-Page_56"></A>  the Father. He who possesses the word of Jesus, is truly able to hear even His very silence, that he may be perfect, and may both act as he speaks, and be recognised by his silence. There is nothing which is hid from God, but our very secrets are near to Him. Let us therefore do all things as those who have Him dwelling in us, that we may be His temples,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_589"></A><A HREF="#fn_589"><FONT SIZE="1">590</FONT></A>
 and He may be in us as our God, which indeed He is, and will manifest Himself before our faces. Wherefore we justly love Him.</p>  
<p><a name="v.ii.xv-p3"></A><a name="v.ii.xv-p3.1"></A><a name="v.ii.xv-p3.2"></A>It is better for a man to be silent and be [a Christian], than to talk and not to be one. &#8220;The kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_590"></A><A HREF="#fn_590"><FONT SIZE="1">591</FONT></A>
 Men &#8220;believe with the heart, and confess with the mouth,&#8221; the one &#8220;unto righteousness,&#8221; the other &#8220;unto salvation.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_591"></A><A HREF="#fn_591"><FONT SIZE="1">592</FONT></A>
 It is good to teach, if he who speaks also acts. For he who shall both &#8220;do and teach, the same shall be great in the kingdom.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_592"><FONT SIZE="1">593</FONT></A>
 Our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, first did and then taught, as Luke testifies, &#8220;whose praise is in the Gospel through all the Churches.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_593"></A><A HREF="#fn_593"><FONT SIZE="1">594</FONT></A>
 There is nothing which is hid from the Lord, but our very secrets are near to Him. Let us therefore do all things as those who have Him dwelling in us, that we may be His temples,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_594"></A><A HREF="#fn_594"><FONT SIZE="1">595</FONT></A>
 and He may be in us as God. Let Christ speak in us, even as He did in Paul. <a name="v.ii.xv-p8.2"></A>Let the Holy Spirit teach us to speak the things of Christ in like manner as He did.</p>
