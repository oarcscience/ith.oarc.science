### <span id="viii.iv.xxxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII.—It is an annoyance to the Jew that Christ is said to be adored. Justin confirms it, however, from [Ps. xlv.](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#000)<span id="viii.iv.xxxviii-p0.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iv.xxxviii-p1"></span>And Trypho said, “Sir, it were good
for us if we obeyed our teachers, who laid down a law that we should
have no intercourse with any of you, and that we should not have even
any communication with you on these questions. For you utter many
blasphemies, in that you seek to persuade us that this crucified man was
with Moses and Aaron, and spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud; then
that he became man, was crucified, and ascended up to heaven, and comes
again to earth, and ought to be worshipped.”

<span id="viii.iv.xxxviii-p2"></span>Then I answered, “I know that, as
the word of God says, this great wisdom of God, the Maker of all things,
and the Almighty, is hid from you. Wherefore, in sympathy with you, I am
striving to the utmost that you may understand these matters which to
you are paradoxical; but if not, that I myself may be innocent in the
day of judgment. For you shall hear other words which appear still more
paradoxical; but be not confounded, nay, rather remain still more
zealous hearers and investigators, despising the tradition of your
teachers, since they are convicted by the Holy Spirit of inability to
perceive the truths taught by God, and of preferring to teach their own
doctrines. <span id="viii.iv.xxxviii-p2.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxxviii-p2.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxxviii-p2.3"></span>Accordingly, in the forty-fourth
\[forty-fifth\] Psalm, these words are in like manner referred to
Christ: ‘My heart has brought forth a good matter; <span
id="fr_2043"></span>[2044](#fn_2043) I tell my works to the King. My
tongue is the pen of a ready writer. Fairer in beauty than the sons of
men: grace is poured forth into Thy lips: therefore hath God blessed
Thee for ever. Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O mighty One. Press on in
Thy fairness and in Thy beauty, and prosper and reign, because of truth,
and of meekness, and of righteousness: and Thy right hand shall instruct
Thee marvellously. Thine arrows are sharpened, O mighty One; the people
shall fall under Thee; in the heart of the enemies of the King \[the
arrows are fixed\]. Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre
of equity <span id="page_214">p. 214</span> <span
id="viii.iv.xxxviii-Page_214"></span> is the sceptre of Thy kingdom.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hast hated iniquity; therefore thy
God <span id="fr_2044"></span>[2045](#fn_2044) hath anointed Thee with
the oil of gladness above Thy fellows. \[He hath anointed Thee\] with
myrrh, <span id="fr_2045"></span>[2046](#fn_2045) and oil, and cassia,
from Thy garments; from the ivory palaces, whereby they made Thee glad.
Kings’ daughters are in Thy honour. The queen stood at Thy right hand,
clad in garments <span id="fr_2046"></span>[2047](#fn_2046) embroidered
with gold. Hearken, O daughter, and behold, and incline thine ear, and
forget thy people and the house of thy father: and the King shall desire
thy beauty; because He is thy Lord, they shall worship Him also. And the
daughter of Tyre \[shall be there\] with gifts. The rich of the people
shall entreat Thy face. All the glory of the King’s daughter \[is\]
within, clad in embroidered garments of needlework. The virgins that
follow her shall be brought to the King; her neighbours shall be brought
unto Thee: they shall be brought with joy and gladness: they shall be
led into the King’s shrine. Instead of thy fathers, thy sons have been
born: Thou shalt appoint them rulers over all the earth. I shall
remember Thy name in every generation: therefore the people shall
confess Thee for ever, and for ever and ever.’
