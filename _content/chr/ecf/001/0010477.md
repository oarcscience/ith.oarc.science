### <span id="viii.iv.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Circumcision given as a sign, that the Jews might be driven away for their evil deeds done to Christ and the Christians.

<span id="viii.iv.xvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xvi-p1.2"></span>“And God
himself proclaimed by Moses, speaking thus: ‘And circumcise the hardness
of your hearts, and no longer stiffen the neck. For the Lord your God is
both Lord of lords, and a great, mighty, and terrible God, who regardeth
not persons, and taketh not rewards.’ <span
id="fr_1981"></span>[1982](#fn_1981) And in Leviticus: ‘Because they
have transgressed against Me, and despised Me, and because they have
walked contrary to Me, I also walked contrary to them, and I shall cut
them off in the land of their enemies. Then shall their uncircumcised
heart be turned. <span id="fr_1982"></span>[1983](#fn_1982) For the
circumcision according to the flesh, which is from Abraham, was given
for a sign; that you may be separated from other nations, and from us;
and that you alone may suffer that which you now justly suffer; and that
your land may be desolate, and your cities burned with fire; and that
strangers may eat your fruit in your presence, and not one of you may go
up to Jerusalem.’ <span id="fr_1983"></span>[1984](#fn_1983) For you are
not recognised among the rest of men by any other mark than your fleshly
circumcision. For none of you, I suppose, will venture to say that God
neither did nor does foresee the events, which are future, nor
foreordained his deserts for each one. Accordingly, these things have
happened to you in fairness and justice, for you have slain the Just
One, and His prophets before Him; and now you reject those who hope in
Him, and in Him who sent Him—God the Almighty and Maker of all things
—cursing in your synagogues those that believe on Christ. For you have
not the power to lay hands upon us, on account of those who now have the
mastery. But as often as you could, you did so. Wherefore God, by
Isaiah, calls to you, saying, ‘Behold how the righteous <span
id="page_203">p. 203</span> <span id="viii.iv.xvi-Page_203"></span> man
perished, and no one regards it. For the righteous man is taken away
from before iniquity. His grave shall be in peace, he is taken away from
the midst. Draw near hither, ye lawless children, seed of the
adulterers, and children of the whore. Against whom have you sported
yourselves, and against whom have you opened the mouth, and against whom
have you loosened the tongue?’ <span

Hadrian’s recent edict\] were prohibited by law from entering Jerusalem
on pain of death. And so Justin sees in circumcision their own
punishment.
