### <span id="ii.ii.liv-p0.1"></span>Chapter LIV.—He who is full of love will incur every loss, that peace may be restored to the Church.

<span id="ii.ii.liv-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.liv-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.liv-p1.2"></span>Who then among you is noble-minded? who
compassionate? who full of love? Let him declare, “If on my account
sedition and disagreement and schisms have arisen, I will depart, I will
go away whithersoever ye desire, and I will do whatever the
majority <span id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240) commands; only let the
flock of Christ live on terms of peace with the presbyters set over it.”
He that acts thus shall procure to himself great glory in the Lord; and
every place will welcome <span id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241) him.
For “the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.” <span
id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242) These things they who live a godly
life, that is never to be repented of, both have done and always will
do.

<span id="ii.ii.liv-p2"></span> Literally, “the multitude.” \[Clement
here puts words into the mouth of the Corinthian presbyters. It has been
strangely quoted to strengthen a conjecture that he had humbly preferred
Linus and Cletus when first called to preside.\]
