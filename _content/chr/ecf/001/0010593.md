### <span id="viii.iv.cxxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXXII.—How great the power was of the name of Jesus in the Old Testament.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxxii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxxii-p1.1"></span>“Yet after this you made a calf, and
were very zealous in committing fornication with the daughters of
strangers, and in serving idols. And again, when the land was given up
to you with so great a display of power, that you witnessed <span
id="fr_2461"></span>[2462](#fn_2461) the sun stand still in the heavens
by the order of that man whose name was Jesus (Joshua), and not go down
for thirty-six hours, <span id="page_266">p. 266</span> <span
id="viii.iv.cxxxii-Page_266"></span> as well as all the other miracles
which were wrought for you as time served; <span
id="fr_2462"></span>[2463](#fn_2462) and of these it seems good to me
now to speak of another, for it conduces to your hereby knowing Jesus,
whom we also know to have been Christ the Son of God, who was crucified,
and rose again, and ascended to heaven, and will come again to judge all
men, even up to Adam himself. You are aware, then,” I continued, “that
when the ark of the testimony was seized by the enemies of Ashdod, <span
id="fr_2463"></span>[2464](#fn_2463) and a terrible and incurable malady
had broken out among them, they resolved to place it on a cart to which
they yoked cows that had recently calved, for the purpose of
ascertaining by trial whether or not they had been plagued by God’s
power on account of the ark, and if God wished it to be taken back to
the place from which it had been carried away. And when they had done
this, the cows, led by no man, went not to the place whence the ark had
been taken, but to the fields of a certain man whose name was Oshea, the
same as his whose name was altered to Jesus (Joshua), as has been
previously mentioned, who also led the people into the land and meted it
out to them: and when the cows had come into these fields they remained
there, showing to you thereby that they were guided by the name of
power; <span id="fr_2464"></span>[2465](#fn_2464) just as formerly the
people who survived of those that came out of Egypt, were guided into
the land by him who had received the name Jesus (Joshua), who before was
called Oshea.
