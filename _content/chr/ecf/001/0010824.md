### <span id="ix.vi.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—Refutation of the arguments of the Marcionites, who attempted to show that God was the author of sin, because He blinded Pharaoh and his servants.

<span id="ix.vi.xxx-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.xxx-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.vi.xxx-p1.2"></span><span id="ix.vi.xxx-p1.3"></span>“But,” say
they, “God hardened the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants.” <span
id="fr_4207"></span>[4208](#fn_4207) Those, then, who allege such
difficulties, do not read in the Gospel that passage where the Lord
replied to the disciples, when they asked Him, “Why speakest Thou unto
them in parables?”—“Because it is given unto you to know the mystery of
the kingdom of heaven; but to them I speak in parables, that seeing they
may not see, and hearing they may not hear, understanding they may not
understand; in order that the prophecy of Isaiah regarding them may be
fulfilled, saying, Make the heart of this people gross and make their
ears dull, and blind their eyes. But blessed are your eyes, which see
the things that ye see; and your ears, which hear what ye do
hear.” <span id="fr_4208"></span>[4209](#fn_4208) For one and the same
God \[that blesses others\] inflicts blindness upon those who do not
believe, but who set Him at naught; just as the sun, which is a creature
of His, \[acts with regard\] to those who, by reason of any weakness of
the eyes cannot behold his light; but to those who believe in Him and
follow Him, He grants a fuller and greater illumination of mind. In
accordance with this word, therefore, does the apostle say, in the
Second \[Epistle\] to the Corinthians: “In whom the this world hath
blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the
glorious Gospel of Christ should shine \[unto them\].” <span
id="fr_4209"></span>[4210](#fn_4209) And again, in that to the Romans:
“And as they did not think fit to have God in their knowledge, God gave
them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things that are not
convenient.” <span id="fr_4210"></span>[4211](#fn_4210) Speaking of
antichrist, too, he says clearly in the Second to the Thessalonians:
“And for this cause God shall send them the working of error, that they
should believe a lie; that they all might be judged who believed not the
truth, but consented to iniquity.” <span
id="fr_4211"></span>[4212](#fn_4211)

<span id="ix.vi.xxx-p7"></span>2. If, therefore, in the present time
also, God, knowing the number of those who will not believe, since He
foreknows all things, has given them over to unbelief, and turned away
His face from men of this stamp, leaving them in the darkness which they
have themselves chosen for themselves, what is there wonderful if He did
also at that time give over to their unbelief, Pharaoh, who never would
have believed, along with those who were with him? As the Word spake to
Moses from the bush: “And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let
you go, unless by a mighty hand.” <span
id="fr_4212"></span>[4213](#fn_4212) And for the reason that the Lord
spake in parables, and brought blindness upon Israel, that seeing they
might not see, since He knew the \[spirit of\] unbelief in them, for the
same reason did He harden Pharaoh’s heart; in order that, while seeing
that it was the finger of God which led forth the people, he might not
believe, but be precipitated into a sea of unbelief, resting in the
notion that the exit of these \[Israelites\] was accomplished by magical
power, and that it was not by the operation of God that the Red Sea
afforded a passage to the people, but that this occurred by merely
natural causes (*sed naturaliter sic se habere*).
