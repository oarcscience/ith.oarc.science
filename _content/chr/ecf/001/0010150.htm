Now such persons seem to me to be not possessed of a good conscience, seeing they are not stedfastly gathered together according to the commandment.</p>  
<p><a name="v.iii.iv-p2"></A><a name="v.iii.iv-p2.1"></A>It is fitting, then, not only to be called Christians, but to be so in reality. For it is not the being called so, but the being really so, that renders a man blessed. To those who indeed talk of the bishop, but do all things without him, will He who is the true and first Bishop, and the only High Priest by nature, declare, &#8220;Why call ye Me Lord, and do not the things which I say?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_662"></A><A HREF="#fn_662"><FONT SIZE="1">663</FONT></A>
 For such persons seem to me not possessed of a good conscience, but to be simply dissemblers and hypocrites.</p>
