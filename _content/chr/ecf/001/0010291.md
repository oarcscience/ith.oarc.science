### <span id="v.xvii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Christ was truly born, and died.

<span id="v.xvii.iii-p1"></span>For there is but One that became
incarnate, and that neither the Father nor the Paraclete, but the Son
only, \[who became so\] not in appearance or imagination, but in
reality. For “the Word became flesh.” <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316) For “Wisdom builded for herself a
house.” <span id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317) And God the Word was
born as man, with a body, of the Virgin, without any intercourse of man.
For \[it is written\], “A virgin shall conceive in her womb, and bring
forth a son.” <span id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318) He was then
truly born, truly grew up, truly ate and drank, was truly crucified, and
died, and rose again. He who believes these things, as they really were,
<span id="page_117">p. 117</span> <span id="v.xvii.iii-Page_117"></span>
and as they really took place, is blessed. He who believeth them not is
no less accursed than those who crucified the Lord. For the prince of
this world rejoiceth when any one denies the cross, since he knows that
the confession of the cross is his own destruction. For that is the
trophy which has been raised up against his power, which when he sees,
he shudders, and when he hears of, is afraid.
