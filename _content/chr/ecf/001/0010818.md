### <span id="ix.vi.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—The patriarchs and prophets by pointing out the advent of Christ, fortified thereby, as it were, the way of posterity to the faith of Christ; and so the labours of the apostles were lessened inasmuch as they gathered in the fruits of the labours of others.

<span id="ix.vi.xxiv-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>For
which reason the Lord declared to the disciples: “Behold, I say unto
you, Lift up your eyes, and look upon the districts (*regiones*), for
they are white \[already\] to harvest. For the harvest-man receiveth
wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal, that both he that soweth
and he that reapeth may rejoice together. For in this is the saying
true, that one soweth and another reapeth. For I have sent you forward
to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour; other men have laboured, and
ye have entered into their labours.” <span
id="fr_4130"></span>[4131](#fn_4130) Who, then, are they that have
laboured, and have helped forward the dispensations of God? <span
id="ix.vi.xxiv-p2.2"></span>It is clear that they are the patriarchs and
prophets, who even prefigured our faith, and disseminated through the
earth the advent of the Son of God, who and what He should be: so that
posterity, possessing the fear of God, might easily accept the advent of
Christ, having been instructed by the prophets. And for this reason it
was, that when Joseph became aware that Mary was with child, and was
minded to put her away privily, the angel said to him in sleep: “Fear
not to take to thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is
of the Holy Ghost. For she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call
His name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their sins.” <span
id="fr_4131"></span>[4132](#fn_4131) And exhorting him \[to this\], he
added: “Now all this has been done, that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be
with child, and shall bring forth a son, and His name shall be called
Emmanuel;” thus influencing him by the words of the prophet, and warding
off blame from Mary, pointing out that it was she who was the virgin
mentioned by Isaiah beforehand, who should give birth to Emmanuel.
Wherefore, when Joseph was convinced beyond all doubt, he both did take
Mary, and joyfully yielded obedience in regard to all the rest of the
education of Christ, undertaking a journey into Egypt and back again,
and then a removal to Nazareth. \[For this reason,\] those who knew not
the Scriptures nor the promise of God, nor the dispensation of Christ,
at last called him the father of the child. For this reason, too, did
the Lord Himself read at Capernaum the prophecies of Isaiah: <span
id="fr_4132"></span>[4133](#fn_4132) “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me,
because He hath anointed Me; to preach the Gospel to the poor hath He
sent Me, to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the
captives, and sight to the blind.” <span
id="fr_4133"></span>[4134](#fn_4133) At the same time, showing that it
was He Himself who had been foretold by Esaias the prophet, He said to
them: “This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.”

<span id="ix.vi.xxiv-p6"></span>2. For this reason, also, Philip, when
he had discovered the eunuch of the Ethiopians’ queen reading these
words which had been written: “He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;
and as a lamb is dumb before the shearer, so He opened not His mouth: in
His humiliation His judgment was taken away;” <span
id="fr_4134"></span>[4135](#fn_4134) and all the rest which the prophet
proceeded to relate in regard <span id="page_495">p. 495</span> <span
id="ix.vi.xxiv-Page_495"></span> to His passion and His coming in the
flesh, and how He was dishonoured by those who did not believe Him;
easily persuaded him to believe on Him, that He was Christ Jesus, who
was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and suffered whatsoever the prophet
had predicted, and that He was the Son of God, who gives eternal life to
men. And immediately when \[Philip\] had baptized him, he departed from
him. For nothing else \[but baptism\] was wanting to him who had been
already instructed by the prophets: he was not ignorant of God the
Father, nor of the rules as to the \[proper\] manner of life, but was
merely ignorant of the advent of the Son of God, which, when he had
become acquainted with, in a short space of time, he went on his way
rejoicing, to be the herald in Ethiopia of Christ’s advent. Therefore
Philip had no great labour to go through with regard to this man,
because he was already prepared in the fear of God by the prophets. For
this reason, too, did the apostles, collecting the sheep which had
perished of the house of Israel, and discoursing to them from the
Scriptures, prove that this crucified Jesus was the Christ, the Son of
the living God; and they persuaded a great multitude, who, however,
\[already\] possessed the fear of God. And there were, in one day,
baptized three, and four, and five thousand men. <span
