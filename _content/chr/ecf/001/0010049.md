### <span id="ii.ii.xliv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLIV.—The ordinances of the apostles, that there might be no contention respecting the priestly office.

<span id="ii.ii.xliv-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xliv-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xliv-p1.2"></span><span id="ii.ii.xliv-p1.3"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xliv-p1.4"></span><span id="ii.ii.xliv-p1.5"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xliv-p1.6"></span><span id="ii.ii.xliv-p1.7"></span>Our
apostles also knew, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and there would be
strife on account of the office <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188)
of the episcopate. For this reason, therefore, inasmuch as they had
obtained a perfect fore-knowledge of this, they appointed those
\[ministers\] already mentioned, and afterwards gave instructions, <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189) that when these should fall asleep,
other approved men should succeed them in their ministry. <span
id="ii.ii.xliv-p3.2"></span>We are of opinion, therefore, that those
appointed by them, <span id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190) or afterwards
by other eminent men, with the consent of the whole Church, and who have
blamelessly served the flock of Christ in a humble, peaceable, and
disinterested spirit, and have for a long time possessed the good
opinion of all, cannot be justly dismissed from the ministry. <span
id="ii.ii.xliv-p4.1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xliv-p4.2"></span>For our
sin will not be small, if we eject from the episcopate <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191) those who have blamelessly and holily
fulfilled its duties. <span id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192) Blessed
are those presbyters who, having finished their course before now, have
obtained a fruitful and perfect departure \[from this world\]; for they
have no fear lest any one deprive them of the place now appointed them.
But we see that ye have removed some men of excellent behaviour from the
ministry, which they fulfilled blamelessly and with honour.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_188"></span>[17:189](0010049.htm#fr_188) <span
id="ii.ii.xliv-p1.8"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.xliv-p2"></span> Literally, “on account of the title of
the oversight.” Some understand this to mean, “in regard to the dignity
of the episcopate;” and others simply, “on account of the oversight.”

<span id="fn_189"></span>[17:190](0010049.htm#fr_189) <span
id="ii.ii.xliv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.xliv-p3"></span> The meaning of this passage is much
controverted. Some render, “left a list of other approved persons;”
while others translate the unusual word <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.ii.xliv-p3.1"></span>ἐπινομή</span>, which causes the difficulty,
by “testamentary direction,” and many others deem the text corrupt. We
have given what seems the simplest version of the text as it stands.
\[Comp. the versions of Wake, Chevallier, and others.\]

<span id="fn_190"></span>[17:191](0010049.htm#fr_190) <span
id="ii.ii.xliv-p3.3"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.xliv-p4"></span> i.e., the apostles.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[17:192](0010049.htm#fr_191) <span
id="ii.ii.xliv-p4.3"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.xliv-p5"></span> Or, “oversight.”

<span id="fn_192"></span>[17:193](0010049.htm#fr_192) <span
id="ii.ii.xliv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.xliv-p6"></span> Literally, “presented the offerings.”
