### <span id="viii.vi.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Reasons for addressing the Greeks.

<span id="viii.vi.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.vi.i-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.i-p1.2"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="viii.vi.i-p1.3"></span>As</span> I begin this hortatory address to
you, ye men of Greece, I pray God that I may know what I ought to say to
you, and that you, shaking off your habitual <span
id="fr_2506"></span>[2507](#fn_2506) love of disputing, and being
delivered from the error of your fathers, may now choose what is
profitable; not fancying that you commit any offence against your
forefathers, though the things which you formerly considered by no means
salutary should now seem useful to you. For accurate investigation of
matters, putting truth to the question with a more searching scrutiny,
often reveals that things which have passed for excellent are of quite
another sort. Since, then, we propose to discourse of the true religion
(than which, I think, there is nothing which is counted more valuable by
those who desire to pass through life without danger, on account of the
judgment which is to be after the termination of this life, and which is
announced not only by our forefathers according to God, to wit the
prophets and lawgivers, but also by those among yourselves who have been
esteemed wise, not poets alone, but also philosophers, who professed
among you that they had attained the true and divine knowledge), I think
it well first of all to examine the teachers of religion, both our own
and yours, who they were, and how great, and in what times they lived;
in order that those who have formerly received from their fathers the
false religion, may now, when they perceive this, be extricated from
that inveterate error; and that we may clearly and manifestly show that
we ourselves follow the religion of our forefathers according to God.
