Whence also, having discoursed at length on the number six, he declares that all things which have been framed by God are divided into six classes,&#8212;viz., into things intelligent and immortal, such as are the angels; into things reasonable and mortal, such as mankind; into things sensitive and irrational, such as cattle, and birds, and fishes; into things that can advance, and move, and are insensible, such as the winds, and the clouds, and the waters, and the stars; into things which increase and are immoveable, such as the trees; and into things which are insensible and immoveable, such as the mountains, the earth, and such like. For all the creatures of God, in heaven and on earth, fall under one or other of these divisions, and are circumscribed by them.&#8212; <i>From the writings of</i> <span class="upper"><a name="viii.ix.xv-p1.3"></A>Anastasius</span>.</p>
