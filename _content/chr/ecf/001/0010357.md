### <span id="vi.ii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Conclusion.

<span id="vi.ii.xxi-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xxi-p1.1"></span>It is
well, therefore, <span id="fr_1716"></span>[1717](#fn_1716) that he who
has learned the judgments of the Lord, as many as have been written,
should walk in them. For he who keepeth these shall be glorified in the
kingdom of God; but he who chooseth other things <span
id="fr_1717"></span>[1718](#fn_1717) shall be destroyed with his works.
On this account there will be a resurrection, <span
id="fr_1718"></span>[1719](#fn_1718) on this account a retribution. I
beseech you who are superiors, if you will receive any counsel of my
good-will, have among yourselves those to whom you may show kindness: do
not forsake them. For the day is at hand on which all things shall
perish with the evil \[one\]. The Lord is near, and His reward. Again,
and yet again, I beseech you: be good lawgivers <span
id="fr_1719"></span>[1720](#fn_1719) to one another; continue faithful
counsellors of one another; take away from among you all hypocrisy. And
may God, who ruleth over all the world, give to you wisdom,
intelligence, understanding, knowledge of His judgments, <span
id="fr_1720"></span>[1721](#fn_1720) with patience. And be ye <span
id="fr_1721"></span>[1722](#fn_1721) taught of God, inquiring diligently
what the Lord asks from you; and do it that ye maybe safe in the day of
judgment. <span id="fr_1722"></span>[1723](#fn_1722) And if you have any
remembrance of what is good, be mindful of me, meditating on these
things, in order that both my desire and watchfulness may result in some
good. I beseech you, entreating this as a favour. While yet you are in
this fair vessel, <span id="fr_1723"></span>[1724](#fn_1723) do not fail
in any one of those things, <span id="fr_1724"></span>[1725](#fn_1724)
but unceasingly seek after them, and fulfil every commandment; for these
things are worthy. <span id="fr_1725"></span>[1726](#fn_1725) Wherefore
I have been the more earnest to write to you, as my ability
served, <span id="fr_1726"></span>[1727](#fn_1726) that I might cheer
you. <span id="vi.ii.xxi-p12.1"></span>Farewell, ye children of love and
peace. The Lord of glory and of all grace be with your spirit.
Amen. <span id="fr_1727"></span>[1728](#fn_1727)
