<p> <a name="viii.iv.xciii"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.iv.xciii-p0.1"></A>Chapter XCIII.&#8212;The same kind of righteousness is bestowed on all. Christ comprehends it in two precepts.</h3>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.xciii-p1"></A><a name="viii.iv.xciii-p1.1"></A><a name="viii.iv.xciii-p1.2"></A>&#8220;For [God] sets before every race of mankind that which is always and universally just, as well as all righteousness; and every race knows that adultery, and fornication, and homicide,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2311"></A><A HREF="#fn_2311"><FONT SIZE="1">2312</FONT></A>
 and such like, are sinful; and though they all commit such practices, yet they do not escape from the knowledge that they act unrighteously whenever they so do, with the exception of those who are possessed with an unclean spirit, and who have been debased by education, by wicked customs, and by sinful institutions, and who have lost, or rather quenched and put under, their natural ideas. For we may see that such persons are unwilling to submit to the same things which they inflict upon others, and reproach each other with hostile consciences for the acts which they perpetrate. <a name="viii.iv.xciii-p2.4"></A>And hence I think that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ spoke well when He summed up all righteousness and piety in two commandments. They are these: &#145;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy strength, and thy neighbour as thyself.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2312"></A><A HREF="#fn_2312"><FONT SIZE="1">2313</FONT></A>
 For the man who loves God with all the heart, and with all the strength, being filled with a God-fearing mind, will reverence no other god; and since God wishes it, he would reverence that angel who is beloved by the same Lord and God. And the man who loves his neighbour as himself will wish for him the same good things that he wishes for himself, and no man will wish evil things for himself. Accordingly, he who loves his neighbour would pray and labour that his neighbour may be possessed of the same benefits as himself. Now nothing else is neighbour to man than that similarly-affectioned and reasonable being&#8212;man. Therefore, since all righteousness is divided into two branches, namely, in so far as it regards God and men, whoever, says the Scripture, loves the Lord God with all the heart, and all the strength, and his neighbour as himself, would be truly a righteous man. <a name="viii.iv.xciii-p3.2"></A>But you were never shown to be possessed of friendship or love either towards God, or towards the prophets, or towards yourselves, but, as is evident, you are ever found to be idolaters and murderers of righteous men, so that you laid hands even on Christ Himself; and to this very day you abide in your wickedness, execrating those who prove that this man who was crucified by you is the Christ. Nay, more than this, you suppose that He was crucified as hostile to and cursed by God, which supposition is the product of your most irrational mind. For though you have the means of understanding that this man is Christ from the signs given by Moses, yet you will not; but, in addition, fancying that we can have no arguments, you put whatever question comes into your minds, while you yourselves are at a loss for arguments whenever you meet with some firmly established Christian.</p>
