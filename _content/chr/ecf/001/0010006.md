### <span id="ii.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—The salutation. Praise of the Corinthians before the breaking forth of schism among them.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.i-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.i-p1.2"></span><span id="ii.ii.i-p1.3"></span><span
class="upper"><span id="ii.ii.i-p1.4"></span>The</span> Church of God
which sojourns at Rome, to the Church of God sojourning at Corinth, to
them that are called and sanctified by the will of God, through our Lord
Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, from Almighty God through Jesus
Christ, be multiplied.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p2"></span>Owing, dear brethren, to the sudden and
successive calamitous events which have happened to ourselves, we feel
that we have been somewhat tardy in turning our attention to the points
respecting which you consulted us; <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2) and
especially to that shameful and detestable sedition, utterly abhorrent
to the elect of God, which a few rash and self-confident persons have
kindled to such a pitch of frenzy, that your venerable and illustrious
name, worthy to be universally loved, has suffered grievous
injury. <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3) For who ever dwelt even for a
short time among you, and did not find your faith to be as fruitful of
virtue as it was firmly established? <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4)
Who did not admire the sobriety and moderation of your godliness in
Christ? Who did not proclaim the magnificence of your habitual
hospitality? And who did not rejoice over your perfect and well-grounded
knowledge? For ye did all things without respect of persons, and walked
in the commandments of God, being obedient to those who had the rule
over you, and giving all fitting honour to the presbyters among you. Ye
enjoined young men to be of a sober and serious mind; ye instructed your
wives to do all things with a blameless, becoming, and pure conscience,
loving their husbands as in duty bound; and ye taught them that, living
in the rule of obedience, they should manage their household affairs
becomingly, and be in every respect marked by discretion.
