### <span id="viii.ii.lviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LVIII.—And raise up heretics.

<span id="viii.ii.lviii-p1"></span><span

id="viii.ii.lviii-p1.3"></span><span id="viii.ii.lviii-p1.4"></span>And,
as we said before, the devils put forward Marcion of Pontus, who is even
now teaching men to deny that God is the maker of all things in heaven
and on earth, and that the Christ predicted by the prophets is His Son,
and preaches another god besides the Creator of all, and likewise
another son. And this man many have believed, as if he alone knew the
truth, and laugh at us, though they have no proof of what they say, but
are carried away irrationally as lambs by a wolf, and become the prey of
atheistical doctrines, and of devils. For they who are called devils
attempt nothing else than to seduce men from God who made them, and from
Christ His first-begotten; and those who are unable to raise themselves
above the earth they have riveted, and do now rivet, to things earthly,
and to the works of their own hands; but those who devote themselves to
the contemplation of things divine, they secretly beat back; and if they
have not a wise sober-mindedness, and a pure and passionless life, they
drive them into godlessness.
