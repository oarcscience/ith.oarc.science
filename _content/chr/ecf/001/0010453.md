### <span id="viii.iii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—All have been hated in whom the Word has dwelt.

<span id="viii.iii.viii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>And those of the Stoic school—since, so
far as their moral teaching went, they were admirable, as were also the
poets in some particulars, on account of the seed of reason \[the
Logos\] implanted in every race of men—were, we know, hated and put to
death,—Heraclitus for instance, and, among those of our own time,
Musonius and others. For, as we intimated, the devils have always
effected, that all those who anyhow live a reasonable and earnest life,
and shun vice, be hated. <span id="viii.iii.viii-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iii.viii-p1.3"></span>And it is nothing wonderful; if the
devils are proved to cause those to be much worse hated who live not
according to a part only of the word diffused \[among men\] but by the
knowledge and contemplation of the whole Word, which is Christ. And
they, having been shut up in eternal fire, shall suffer their just
punishment and penalty. For if they are even now overthrown by men
through the name of Jesus Christ, this is an intimation of the
punishment in eternal fire which is to be inflicted on themselves and
those who serve them. For thus did both all the prophets foretell, and
our own teacher Jesus teach. <span id="fr_1934"></span>[1935](#fn_1934)
