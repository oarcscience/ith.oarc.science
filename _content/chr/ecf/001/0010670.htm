<p><a name="viii.ix.iii-p1"></A><a name="viii.ix.iii-p1.1"></A>Justin well said: Before the advent of the Lord, Satan never ventured to blaspheme God, inasmuch as he was not yet sure of his own damnation, since that was announced concerning him by the prophets only in parables and allegories. But after the advent of the Lord learning plainly from the discourses of Christ and His apostles that eternal fire was prepared for him who voluntarily departed from God and for all who, without repentance, persevere in apostasy, then, by means of a man of this sort, he, as if already condemned, blasphemes that God who inflicts judgment upon him, and imputes the sin of his apostasy to his Maker, instead of to his own will and predilection.&#8212;<span class="upper"><a name="viii.ix.iii-p1.2"></A>Iren&aelig;us</span>: <i>Heresies</i>, v. 26.</p>
