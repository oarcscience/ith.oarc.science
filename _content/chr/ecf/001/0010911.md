### <span id="ix.viii.xxxvi-p0.1"></span>XXXVI.

<span id="ix.viii.xxxvi-p1"></span><span
id="ix.viii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>True <span
id="fr_4857"></span>[4858](#fn_4857) knowledge, then, consists in the
understanding of Christ, which Paul terms the wisdom of God hidden in a
mystery, which “the natural man receiveth not,” <span
id="fr_4858"></span>[4859](#fn_4858) the doctrine of the cross; of which
if any man “taste,” <span id="fr_4859"></span>[4860](#fn_4859) he will
not accede to the disputations and quibbles of proud and puffed-up
men, <span id="fr_4860"></span>[4861](#fn_4860) who go into matters of
which they have no perception. <span
id="fr_4861"></span>[4862](#fn_4861) For the truth is unsophisticated
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.viii.xxxvi-p6.2"></span>ἀσχημάτιστος</span>); and “the word is
nigh thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart,” <span
id="fr_4862"></span>[4863](#fn_4862) as the same apostle declares, being
easy of comprehension to those who are obedient. For it renders us like
to Christ, if we experience “the power of his resurrection and the
fellowship of His sufferings.” <span
id="fr_4863"></span>[4864](#fn_4863) For this is the affinity <span
id="fr_4864"></span>[4865](#fn_4864) of the apostolical teaching and the
most holy “faith delivered unto us,” <span
id="fr_4865"></span>[4866](#fn_4865) which the unlearned receive, and
those of slender knowledge have taught, not “giving heed to endless
genealogies,” <span id="fr_4866"></span>[4867](#fn_4866) but studying
rather \[to observe\] a straightforward course of life; lest, having
been deprived of the Divine Spirit, they fail to attain to the kingdom
of heaven. For truly the first thing is to deny one’s self and to follow
Christ; and those who do this are borne onward to perfection, having
fulfilled all their Teacher’s will, becoming sons of God by spiritual
regeneration, and heirs of the kingdom of heaven; those who seek which
first shall not be forsaken.

id="ix.viii.xxxvi-p1.2"></span>

<span id="ix.viii.xxxvi-p2"></span> This extract and the next three were
discovered in the year 1715 by \[Christopher Matthew\] Pfaff, a learned
Lutheran, in the Royal Library at Turin. The <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.viii.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>mss.</span> from which they were taken
were neither catalogued nor classified, and have now disappeared from
the collection. It is impossible to say with any degree of probability
from what treatises of our author these four fragments have been culled.
For a full account of their history, see Stieren’s edition of Irenæus,
vol. ii. p. 381. \[But, in all candor, let Pfaff himself be heard. His
little work is full of learning, and I have long possessed it as a
treasure to which I often recur. Pfaff’s *Irenæi Fragmenta* was
published at The Hague, 1715.\]
