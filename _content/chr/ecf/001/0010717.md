### <span id="ix.ii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—The apocryphal and spurious Scriptures of the Marcosians, with passages of the Gospels which they pervert.

<span id="ix.ii.xxi-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.ii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Besides the above \[misrepresentations\],
they adduce an unspeakable number of apocryphal and spurious writings,
which they themselves have forged, to bewilder the minds of foolish men,
and of such as are ignorant of the Scriptures of truth. Among other
things, they bring forward that false and wicked story <span
id="fr_2910"></span>[2911](#fn_2910) which <span id="page_345">p.
345</span> <span id="ix.ii.xxi-Page_345"></span> relates that our Lord,
when He was a boy learning His letters, on the teacher saying to Him, as
is usual, “Pronounce Alpha,” replied \[as He was bid\], “Alpha.” But
when, again, the teacher bade Him say, “Beta,” the Lord replied, “Do
thou first tell me what Alpha is, and then I will tell thee what Beta
is.” This they expound as meaning that He alone knew the Unknown, which
He revealed under its type Alpha.

<span id="ix.ii.xxi-p3"></span>2. <span id="ix.ii.xxi-p3.1"></span>Some
passages, also, which occur in the Gospels, receive from them a
colouring of the same kind, such as the answer which He gave His mother
when He was twelve years of age: “Wist ye not that I must be about My
Father’s business?” <span id="fr_2911"></span>[2912](#fn_2911) Thus,
they say, He announced to them the Father of whom they were ignorant. On
this account, also, He sent forth the disciples to the twelve tribes,
that they might proclaim to them the unknown God. And to the person who
said to Him, “Good Master,” <span id="fr_2912"></span>[2913](#fn_2912)
He confessed that God who is truly good, saying, “Why callest thou Me
good: there is One who is good, the Father in the heavens;” <span
id="fr_2913"></span>[2914](#fn_2913) and they assert that in this
passage the Æons receive the name of heavens. Moreover, by His not
replying to those who said to Him, “By what power doest Thou
this?” <span id="fr_2914"></span>[2915](#fn_2914) but by a question on
His own side, put them to utter confusion; by His thus not replying,
according to their interpretation, He showed the unutterable nature of
the Father. Moreover, when He said, “I have often desired to hear one of
these words, and I had no one who could utter it,” <span
id="fr_2915"></span>[2916](#fn_2915) they maintain, that by this
expression “one” He set forth the one true God whom they knew not.
Further, when, as He drew nigh to Jerusalem, He wept over it and said,
“If thou hadst known, even thou, in this thy day, the things that belong
unto thy peace, but they are hidden from thee,” <span
id="fr_2916"></span>[2917](#fn_2916) by this word “hidden” He showed the
abstruse nature of Bythus. And again, when He said, “Come unto Me all ye
that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest, and learn of
Me,” <span id="fr_2917"></span>[2918](#fn_2917) He announced the Father
of truth. For what they knew not, these men say that He promised to
teach them.

<span id="ix.ii.xxi-p11"></span>3. But they adduce the following passage
as the highest testimony, <span id="fr_2918"></span>[2919](#fn_2918)
and, as it were, the very crown of their system:—“I thank Thee, O
Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things
from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes. Even so, my
Father; for so it seemed good in Thy sight. All things have been
delivered to Me by My Father; and no one knoweth the Father but the Son,
or the Son but the Father, and he to whom the Son will reveal
Him.” <span id="fr_2919"></span>[2920](#fn_2919) In these words they
affirm that He clearly showed that the Father of truth, conjured into
existence by them, was known to no one before His advent. And they
desire to construe the passage as if teaching that the Maker and Framer
\[of the world\] was always known by all, while the Lord spoke these
words concerning the Father unknown to all, whom they now proclaim.
