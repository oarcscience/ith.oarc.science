<p> <a name="v.iii.xi"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="v.iii.xi-p0.1"></A>Chapter XI.&#8212;I write these things to warn you.</h3>  
<p><a name="v.iii.xi-p1"></A><a name="v.iii.xi-p1.1"></A>These things [I address to you], my beloved, not that I know any of you to be in such a state;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_705"></A><A HREF="#fn_705"><FONT SIZE="1">706</FONT></A>
 but, as less than any of you, I desire to guard you beforehand, that ye fall not upon the hooks of vain doctrine, but that  <A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A> <a name="v.iii.xi-Page_64"></A>  ye attain to full assurance in regard to the birth, and passion, and resurrection which took place in the time of the government of Pontius Pilate, being truly and certainly accomplished by Jesus Christ, who is our hope,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_706"></A><A HREF="#fn_706"><FONT SIZE="1">707</FONT></A>
 from which may no one of you ever be turned aside.</p>  
<p><a name="v.iii.xi-p4"></A><a name="v.iii.xi-p4.1"></A>These things [I address to you], my beloved, not that I know any of you to be in such a state;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_707"></A><A HREF="#fn_707"><FONT SIZE="1">708</FONT></A>
 but, as less than any of you, I desire to guard you beforehand, that ye fall not upon the hooks of vain doctrine, but that you may rather attain to a full assurance in Christ, who was begotten by the Father before all ages, but was afterwards born of the Virgin Mary without any intercourse with man. <a name="v.iii.xi-p5.1"></A>He also lived a holy life, and healed every kind of sickness and disease among the people, and wrought signs and wonders for the benefit of men; and to those who had fallen into the error of polytheism He made known the one and only true God, His Father, and underwent the passion, and endured the cross at the hands of the Christ-killing Jews, under Pontius Pilate the governor and Herod the king. <a name="v.iii.xi-p5.2"></A><a name="v.iii.xi-p5.3"></A>He also died, and rose again, and ascended into the heavens to Him that sent Him, and is sat down at His right hand, and shall come at the end of the world, with His Father&#146;s glory, to judge the living and the dead, and to render to every one according to his works.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_708"></A><A HREF="#fn_708"><FONT SIZE="1">709</FONT></A>
 He who knows these things with a full assurance, and believes them, is happy; even as ye are now the lovers of God and of Christ, in the full assurance of our hope, from which may no one of us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_709"></A><A HREF="#fn_709"><FONT SIZE="1">710</FONT></A>
 ever be turned aside!</p>
