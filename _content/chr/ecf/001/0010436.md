### <span id="viii.ii.lxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXIII.—How God appeared to Moses.

<span id="viii.ii.lxiii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.lxiii-p1.1"></span>And all the Jews even now teach that the
nameless God spake to Moses; whence the Spirit of prophecy, accusing
them by Isaiah the prophet mentioned above, said “The ox knoweth his
owner, and the ass his master’s crib; but Israel doth not know Me, and
My people do not understand.” <span id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897)
And Jesus the Christ, because the Jews knew not what the Father was, and
what the Son, in like manner accused them; and Himself said, “No one
knoweth the Father, but the Son; nor the Son, but the Father, and they
to whom the Son revealeth Him.” <span
id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898) Now the Word of God is His Son, as
we have before said. And He is called Angel and Apostle; for He declares
whatever we ought to know, and is sent forth to declare whatever is
revealed; as our Lord Himself says, “He that heareth Me, heareth Him
that sent Me.” <span id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899) <span
id="viii.ii.lxiii-p4.2"></span>From the writings of Moses also this will
be manifest; for thus it is written in them, “And the Angel of God spake
to Moses, in a flame of fire out of the bush, and said, I am that I am,
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God of thy
fathers; go down into Egypt, and bring forth My people.” <span
id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900) And if you wish to learn what
follows, you can do so from the same writings; for it is impossible to
relate the whole here. But so much is written for the sake of proving
that Jesus the Christ is the Son of God and His Apostle, being of old
the Word, and appearing sometimes in the form of fire, and sometimes in
the likeness of angels; but now, by the will of God, having become man
for the human race, He endured all the sufferings which the devils
instigated the senseless Jews to inflict upon Him; who, though they have
it expressly affirmed in the writings of Moses, “And the angel of God
spake to Moses in a flame of fire in a bush, and said, I am that I am,
the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,” yet
maintain that He who said this was the Father and Creator of the
universe. Whence also the Spirit of prophecy rebukes them, and says,
“Israel doth not know Me, my people have not understood Me.” <span
id="fr_1901"></span>[1902](#fn_1901) And again, Jesus, as we have
already shown, while He was with them, said, “No one knoweth the Father,
but the Son; nor the Son but the Father, and those to whom the Son will
reveal Him.” <span id="fr_1902"></span>[1903](#fn_1902) The Jews,
accordingly, being throughout of opinion that it was the Father of the
universe who spake to Moses, though He who spake to him was indeed the
Son of God, who is called both Angel and Apostle, are justly charged,
both by the Spirit of prophecy and by Christ Himself, with knowing
neither the Father nor the Son. For they who affirm that the Son is the
Father, are proved neither to have become acquainted with the Father,
nor to know that the Father of the universe has a Son; who also, being
the first-begotten Word of God, is even God. And of old He appeared in
the shape of fire and in the likeness of an angel to Moses and to the
other prophets; but now in the times of your reign, <span
id="fr_1903"></span>[1904](#fn_1903) having, as we before said, become
Man by a virgin, according to the counsel of the Father, for the
salvation of those who believe on Him, He endured both to be set at
nought and to suffer, that by dying and rising again He might conquer
death. And that which was said out of the bush to Moses, “I am that I
am, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and
the God of your fathers,” <span id="fr_1904"></span>[1905](#fn_1904)
this signified that they, even though dead, are yet in existence, and
are men belonging to Christ Himself. For they were the first of all men
to busy themselves in the search after God; Abraham being the father of
Isaac, and Isaac of Jacob, as Moses wrote.
