 have learned this religion of yours? For it is impossible that any should know matters so great and divine, who have not themselves learned them first from the initiated.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2517"></A><A HREF="#fn_2517"><FONT SIZE="1">2518</FONT></A>
 You will no doubt say, &#8220;The sages and philosophers.&#8221; For to them, as to a fortified wall, you are wont to flee, when any one quotes the opinions of your poets about the gods. Therefore, since it is fit that we commence with the ancients and the earliest, beginning thence I will produce the opinion of each, much more ridiculous as it is than the theology of the poets. <a name="viii.vi.iii-p3.1"></A>For Thales of Miletus, who took the lead in the study of natural philosophy, declared that water was the first principle of all things; for from water he says that all things are, and that into water all are resolved. <a name="viii.vi.iii-p3.2"></A>And after him Anaximander, who came from the same Miletus, said that the infinite was the first principle of all things; for that from this indeed all things are produced, and into this do all decay. Thirdly, Anaximenes&#8212;and he too was from Miletus&#8212;says that air is the first principle of all things; for he says that from this all things are produced, and into this all are resolved. <a name="viii.vi.iii-p3.3"></A>Heraclitus and Hippasus, from Metapontus, say that fire is the first principle of all things; for from fire all things proceed, and in fire do all things terminate. Anaxagoras of Clazomen&aelig; said that the homogeneous parts are the first principles of all things. <a name="viii.vi.iii-p3.4"></A>Archelaus, the son of Apollodorus, an Athenian, says that the infinite air and its density and rarity are the first principle of all things. All these, forming a succession from Thales, followed the philosophy called by themselves physical.</p>
