### <span id="ii.ii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—We must adhere to those who cultivate peace, not to those who merely pretend to do so.

<span id="ii.ii.xv-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xv-p1.1"></span>Let us
cleave, therefore, to those who cultivate peace with godliness, and not
to those who hypocritically profess to desire it. For \[the Scripture\]
saith in a certain place, “This people honoureth Me with their lips, but
their heart is far from Me.” <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59) And
again: “They bless with their mouth, but curse with their heart.” <span
id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60) And again it saith, “They loved Him with
their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their heart was not
right with Him, neither were they faithful in His covenant.” <span
id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61) “Let the deceitful lips become
silent,” <span id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62) \[and “let the Lord
destroy all the lying lips, <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63) \] and
the boastful tongue of those who have said, Let us magnify our tongue;
our lips are our own; who is lord over us? For the oppression of the
poor, and for the sighing of the needy, will I now arise, saith the
Lord: I will place him in safety; I will deal confidently with
him.” <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64)
