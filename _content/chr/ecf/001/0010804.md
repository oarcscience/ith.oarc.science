### <span id="ix.vi.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—There is but one author, and one end to both covenants.

<span id="ix.vi.x-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.x-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.vi.x-p1.2"></span>All things therefore are of one and the same
substance, that is, from one and the same God; as also the Lord says to
the disciples “Therefore every scribe, which is instructed unto the
kingdom of heaven, is like unto a man that is an householder, which
bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.” <span
id="fr_3898"></span>[3899](#fn_3898) He did not teach that he who
brought forth the old was one, and he that brought forth the new,
another; but that they were one and the same. For the Lord is the good
man of the house, who rules the entire house of His Father; and who
delivers a law suited both for slaves and those who are as yet
undisciplined; and gives fitting precepts to those that are free, and
have been justified by faith, as well as throws His own inheritance open
to those that are sons. And He called His disciples “scribes” and
“teachers of the kingdom of heaven;” of whom also He elsewhere says to
the Jews: “Behold, I send unto you wise men, and scribes, and teachers;
and some of them ye shall kill, and persecute from city to city.” <span
id="fr_3899"></span>[3900](#fn_3899) Now, without contradiction, He
means by those things which are brought forth from the treasure new and
old, the two covenants; the old, that giving of the law which took place
formerly; and He points out as the new, that manner of life required by
the Gospel, of which David says, “Sing unto the <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vi.x-p3.2"></span>Lord</span> a new
song;” <span id="fr_3900"></span>[3901](#fn_3900) and Esaias, “Sing unto
the <span class="upper"><span id="ix.vi.x-p4.2"></span>Lord</span> a new
hymn. His beginning (*initium*), His name is glorified from the height
of the earth: they declare His powers in the isles.” <span
id="fr_3901"></span>[3902](#fn_3901) And Jeremiah says: “Behold, I will
make a new covenant, not as I made with your fathers” <span
id="fr_3902"></span>[3903](#fn_3902) in Mount Horeb. But one and the
same householder produced both covenants, the Word of God, our Lord
Jesus Christ, who spake with both Abraham and Moses, and who has
restored us anew to liberty, and has multiplied that grace which is from
Himself.

<span id="ix.vi.x-p7"></span>2. <span id="ix.vi.x-p7.1"></span>He
declares: “For in this place is One greater than the temple.” <span
id="fr_3903"></span>[3904](#fn_3903) But \[the words\] *greater* and
*less* are not applied to those things which have nothing in common
between themselves, and are of an opposite nature, and mutually
repugnant; but are used in the case of those of the same substance, and
which possess properties in common, but merely differ in number and
size; such as water from water, and light from light, and grace from
grace. Greater, therefore, is that legislation which has been given in
order to liberty than that given in order to bondage; and therefore it
has also been diffused, not throughout one nation \[only\], but over the
whole world. For one and the same Lord, who is greater than the temple,
greater than Solomon, and greater than Jonah, confers gifts upon men,
that is, His own presence, and the resurrection from the dead; but He
does not change God, nor proclaim another Father, but that very same
one, who always has more to measure out to those of His household. And
as their love towards God increases, He bestows more and greater
\[gifts\]; as also the Lord said to His disciples: “Ye shall see greater
things than these.” <span id="fr_3904"></span>[3905](#fn_3904) And Paul
declares: “Not that I have already attained, or that I am justified, or
already have been made perfect. For we know in part, and we prophesy in
part; but when that which is perfect has come, the things which are in
part shall be done away.” <span id="fr_3905"></span>[3906](#fn_3905) As,
therefore, when that which is perfect is come, we shall not see another
Father, but Him whom we now desire to see (for “blessed are the pure in
heart: for they shall see God” <span
id="fr_3906"></span>[3907](#fn_3906) ); neither shall we look for
another Christ and Son of God, but Him who \[was born\] of the Virgin
Mary, who also suffered, in whom too we trust, and whom we love; as
Esaias says: “And they shall say in that day, Behold our <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vi.x-p11.2"></span>Lord</span> God, in whom
we have trusted, and we have rejoiced in our salvation;” <span
id="fr_3907"></span>[3908](#fn_3907) and Peter says in his Epistle:
“Whom, not seeing, ye love; in whom, though now ye see Him not, ye have
believed, ye shall rejoice with joy unspeakable;” <span
id="fr_3908"></span>[3909](#fn_3908) neither do we receive another Holy
Spirit, besides Him who is with us, and who cries, “Abba, Father;” <span
id="fr_3909"></span>[3910](#fn_3909) and we shall make increase in the
very same things \[as now\], and shall make progress, so that no longer
through a glass, or by means of enigmas, but face to face, we shall
enjoy the gifts of God;—so also now, receiving more than the temple, and
more than Solomon, that is, the advent of the Son of God, we have not
been taught another God besides the Framer and the Maker of all, who has
been pointed out to us from the beginning; nor another Christ, the Son
of God, besides Him who was foretold by the prophets.

<span id="ix.vi.x-p15"></span>3. For the new covenant having been known
and preached by the prophets, He who was to carry it out according to
the good pleasure of the Father was also preached, having been revealed
to men as God pleased; that they might always make progress through
believing in Him, and by means of the \[successive\] covenants, <span
id="page_473">p. 473</span> <span id="ix.vi.x-Page_473"></span> should
gradually attain to perfect salvation. <span
id="fr_3910"></span>[3911](#fn_3910) For there is one salvation and one
God; but the precepts which form the man are numerous, and the steps
which lead man to God are not a few. It is allowable for an earthly and
temporal king, though he is \[but\] a man, to grant to his subjects
greater advantages at times: shall not this then be lawful for God,
since He is \[ever\] the same, and is always willing to confer a greater
\[degree of\] grace upon the human race, and to honour continually with
many gifts those who please Him? But if this be to make progress,
\[namely,\] to find out another Father besides Him who was preached from
the beginning; and again, besides him who is imagined to have been
discovered in the second place, to find out a third other, —then the
progress of this man will consist in his also proceeding from a third to
a fourth; and from this, again, to another and another: and thus he who
thinks that he is always making progress of such a kind, will never rest
in one God. For, being driven away from Him who truly is \[God\], and
being turned backwards, he shall be for ever seeking, yet shall never
find out God; <span id="fr_3911"></span>[3912](#fn_3911) but shall
continually swim in an abyss without limits, unless, being converted by
repentance, he return to the place from which he had been cast out,
confessing one God, the Father, the Creator, and believing \[in Him\]
who was declared by the law and the prophets, who was borne witness to
by Christ, as He did Himself declare to those who were accusing His
disciples of not observing the tradition of the elders: “Why do ye make
void the law of God by reason of your tradition? For God said, Honour
thy father and mother; and, Whosoever curseth father or mother, let him
die the death.” <span id="fr_3912"></span>[3913](#fn_3912) And again, He
says to them a second time: “And ye have made void the word of God <span
id="fr_3913"></span>[3914](#fn_3913) by reason of your tradition;”
Christ confessing in the plainest manner Him to be Father and God, who
said in the law, “Honour thy father and mother; that it may be well with
thee.” <span id="fr_3914"></span>[3915](#fn_3914) For the true God did
confess the commandment of the law as the word of God, and called no one
else God besides His own Father.

“profectum” and “prefectum” would be written alike. The same word
(“profectus”) occurs again almost immediately, with an evident reference
