<p><a name="viii.ii.xlii-p1"></A><a name="viii.ii.xlii-p1.1"></A>But when the Spirit of prophecy speaks of things that are about to come to pass as if they had already taken place, &#8212;as may be observed even in the passages already cited by me, &#8212;that  <A NAME="page_177"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 177</FONT></A> <a name="viii.ii.xlii-Page_177"></A>  this circumstance may afford no excuse to readers [for misinterpreting them], we will make even this also quite plain.
