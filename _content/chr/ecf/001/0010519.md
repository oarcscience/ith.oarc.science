<span id="viii.iv.lviii"></span>

### <span id="viii.iv.lviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LVIII.—The same is proved from the visions which appeared to Jacob.

<span id="viii.iv.lviii-p1"></span>Then I continued, “I purpose to quote
to you Scriptures, not that I am anxious to make merely an artful
display of words; for I possess no such faculty, but God’s grace alone
has been granted to me to the understanding of His Scriptures, of which
grace I exhort all to become partakers freely and bounteously, in order
that they may not, through want of it, <span
id="fr_2148"></span>[2149](#fn_2148) incur condemnation in the judgment
which God the Maker of all things shall hold through my Lord Jesus
Christ.”

<span id="viii.iv.lviii-p3"></span>And Trypho said, “What you do is
worthy of the worship of God; but you appear to me to feign ignorance
when you say that you do not possess a store of artful words.”

<span id="viii.iv.lviii-p4"></span>I again replied, “Be it so, since you
think so; yet I am persuaded that I speak the truth. <span
id="fr_2149"></span>[2150](#fn_2149) But give me your attention, that I
may now rather adduce the remaining proofs.”

<span id="viii.iv.lviii-p6"></span>“Proceed,” said he.

<span id="viii.iv.lviii-p7"></span>And I continued: “It is again written
by Moses, my brethren, that He who is called God and appeared to the
patriarchs is called both Angel and Lord, in order that from this you
may understand Him to be minister to the Father of all things, as you
have already admitted, and may remain firm, persuaded by additional
arguments. <span id="viii.iv.lviii-p7.1"></span>The word of God,
therefore, \[recorded\] by Moses, when referring to Jacob the grandson
of Abraham, speaks thus: ‘And it came to pass, when the sheep conceived,
that I saw them with my eyes in the dream: And, behold, the he-goats and
the rams which leaped upon the sheep and she-goats were spotted <span
id="page_226">p. 226</span> <span id="viii.iv.lviii-Page_226"></span>
with white, and speckled and sprinkled with a dun colour. And the Angel
of God said to me in the dream, Jacob, Jacob. And I said, What is it,
Lord? And He said, Lift up thine eyes, and see that the he-goats and
rams leaping on the sheep and she-goats are spotted with white,
speckled, and sprinkled with a dun colour. For I have seen what Laban
doeth unto thee. I am the God who appeared to thee in Bethel, <span
id="fr_2150"></span>[2151](#fn_2150) where thou anointedst a pillar and
vowedst a vow unto Me. Now therefore arise, and get thee out of this
land, and depart to the land of thy birth, and I shall be with
thee.’ <span id="fr_2151"></span>[2152](#fn_2151) And again, in other
words, speaking of the same Jacob, it thus says: ‘And having risen up
that night, he took the two wives, and the two women-servants, and his
eleven children, and passed over the ford Jabbok; and he took them and
went over the brook, and sent over all his belongings. But Jacob was
left behind alone, and an Angel <span
id="fr_2152"></span>[2153](#fn_2152) wrestled with him until morning.
And He saw that He is not prevailing against him, and He touched the
broad part of his thigh; and the broad part of Jacob’s thigh grew stiff
while he wrestled with Him. And He said, Let Me go, for the day
breaketh. But he said, I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me. And
He said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. And He said, Thy
name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; for
thou hast prevailed with God, and with men shalt be powerful. And Jacob
asked Him, and said, Tell me Thy name. But he said, Why dost thou ask
after My name? And He blessed him there. And Jacob called the name of
that place Peniel, <span id="fr_2153"></span>[2154](#fn_2153) for I saw
God face to face, and my soul rejoiced.’ <span
id="fr_2154"></span>[2155](#fn_2154) And again, in other terms,
referring to the same Jacob, it says the following: ‘And Jacob came to
Luz, in the land of Canaan, which is Bethel, he and all the people that
were with him. And there he built an altar, and called the name of that
place Bethel; for there God appeared to him when he fled from the face
of his brother Esau. And Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and was buried
beneath Bethel under an oak: and Jacob called the name of it The Oak of
Sorrow. And God appeared again to Jacob in Luz, when he came out from
Mesopotamia in Syria, and He blessed him. And God said to him, Thy name
shall be no more called Jacob, but Israel shall he thy name.’ <span
id="fr_2155"></span>[2156](#fn_2155) He is called God, and He is and
shall be God.” And when all had agreed on these grounds, I continued:
“Moreover, I consider it necessary to repeat to you the words which
narrate how He who is both Angel and God and Lord, and who appeared as a
man to Abraham, and who wrestled in human form with Jacob, was seen by
him when he fled from his brother Esau. They are as follows: ‘And Jacob
went out from the well of the oath, <span
id="fr_2156"></span>[2157](#fn_2156) and went toward Charran. <span
id="fr_2157"></span>[2158](#fn_2157) And he lighted on a spot, and slept
there, for the sun was set; and he gathered of the stones of the place,
and put them under his head. And he slept in that place; and he dreamed,
and, behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, whose top reached to
heaven; and the angels of God ascended and descended upon it. And the
Lord stood <span id="fr_2158"></span>[2159](#fn_2158) above it, and He
said, I am the Lord, the God of Abraham thy father, and of Isaac; be not
afraid: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy
seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and shall be
extended to the west, and south, and north, and east: and in thee, and
in thy seed, shall all families of the earth be blessed. And, behold, I
am with thee, keeping thee in every way wherein thou goest, and will
bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have
done all that I have spoken to thee of. And Jacob awaked out of his
sleep, and said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.
And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none
other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob
rose up in the morning, and took the stone which he had placed under his
head, and he set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it;
and Jacob called the name of the place The House of God, and the name of
the city formerly was Ulammaus.’ ” <span
