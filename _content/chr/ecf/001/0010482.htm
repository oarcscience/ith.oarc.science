<p> <a name="viii.iv.xxi"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.iv.xxi-p0.1"></A>Chapter XXI.&#8212;Sabbaths were instituted on account of the people&#146;s sins, and not for a work of righteousness.</h3>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.xxi-p1"></A><a name="viii.iv.xxi-p1.1"></A><a name="viii.iv.xxi-p1.2"></A>&#8220;Moreover, that God enjoined you to keep the Sabbath, and impose on you other precepts for a sign, as I have already said, on account of your unrighteousness, and that of your fathers,&#8212;as He declares that for the sake of the nations, lest His name be profaned among them, therefore He permitted some of you to remain alive,&#8212;these words of His can prove to you: they are narrated by Ezekiel thus: &#145;I am the Lord your God; walk in My statutes, and keep My judgments, and take no part in the customs of Egypt; and hallow My Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God. Notwithstanding ye rebelled against Me, and your children walked not in My statutes, neither kept My judgments to do them: which if a man do, he shall live in them. But they polluted My Sabbaths. And I said that I would pour out My fury upon them in the wilderness, to accomplish My anger upon them; yet I did it not; that My name might not be altogether profaned in the sight of the heathen. I led them out before their eyes, and  <A NAME="page_205"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 205</FONT></A> <a name="viii.iv.xxi-Page_205"></A>  I lifted up Mine hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries; because they had not executed My judgments, but had despised My statutes, and polluted My Sabbaths, and their eyes were after the devices of their fathers. Wherefore I gave them also statutes which were not good, and judgments whereby they shall not live. And I shall pollute them in their own gifts, that I may destroy all that openeth the womb, when I pass through them.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1999"></A><A HREF="#fn_1999"><FONT SIZE="1">2000</FONT></A>
