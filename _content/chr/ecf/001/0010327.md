### <span id="v.xxv.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Desire of Ignatius for martyrdom.

<span id="v.xxv.i-p1"></span><span id="v.xxv.i-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.xxv.i-p1.2"></span><span id="v.xxv.i-p1.3"></span><span

id="v.xxv.i-p1.5"></span>When</span> Trajan, not long since, <span
id="fr_1398"></span>[1399](#fn_1398) succeeded to the empire of the
Romans, Ignatius, the disciple of John the apostle, a man in all
respects of an apostolic character, governed the Church of the
Antiochians with great care, having with difficulty escaped the former
storms of the many persecutions under Domitian, inasmuch as, like a good
pilot, by the helm of prayer and fasting, by the earnestness of his
teaching, and by his \[constant <span
id="fr_1399"></span>[1400](#fn_1399) \] spiritual labour, he resisted
the flood that rolled against him, fearing \[only\] lest he should lose
any of those who were deficient in courage, or apt to suffer from their
simplicity. <span id="fr_1400"></span>[1401](#fn_1400) Wherefore he
rejoiced over the tranquil state of the Church, when the persecution
ceased for a little time, but was grieved as to himself, that he had not
yet attained to a true love to Christ, nor reached the perfect rank of a
disciple. For he inwardly reflected, that the confession which is made
by martyrdom, would bring him into a yet more intimate relation to the
Lord. Wherefore, continuing a few years longer with the Church, and,
like a divine lamp, enlightening every one’s understanding by his
expositions of the \[Holy <span id="fr_1401"></span>[1402](#fn_1401) \]
Scriptures, he \[at length\] attained the object of his desire.
