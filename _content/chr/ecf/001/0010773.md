<span id="ix.iv.vii"></span>

### <span id="ix.iv.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI—The Holy Ghost, throughout the Old Testament Scriptures, made mention of no other God or Lord, save him who is the true God.

<span id="ix.iv.vii-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.iv.vii-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.iv.vii-p1.2"></span>Therefore neither would the Lord, nor the
Holy Spirit, nor the apostles, have ever named as God, definitely and
absolutely, him who was not God, unless he were truly God; nor would
they have named any one in his own person Lord, except God the Father
ruling over all, and His Son who has received dominion from His Father
over all creation, as this passage has it: “The <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.iv.vii-p1.3"></span>Lord</span> said unto my
Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy
footstool.” <span id="fr_3328"></span>[3329](#fn_3328) Here the
\[Scripture\] represents to us the Father addressing the Son; He who
gave Him the inheritance of the heathen, and subjected to Him all His
enemies. Since, therefore, the Father is truly Lord, and the Son truly
Lord, the Holy Spirit has fitly designated them by the title of Lord.
And again, referring to the destruction of the Sodomites, the Scripture
says, “Then the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.iv.vii-p2.2"></span>Lord</span> rained upon Sodom and upon
Gomorrah fire and brimstone from the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.iv.vii-p2.3"></span>Lord</span> out of heaven.” <span
id="fr_3329"></span>[3330](#fn_3329) For it here points out that the
Son, who had also been talking with Abraham, had received power to judge
the Sodomites <span id="page_419">p. 419</span> <span
id="ix.iv.vii-Page_419"></span> for their wickedness. And this \[text
following\] does declare the same truth: “Thy throne, O God, is for ever
and ever; the sceptre of Thy kingdom is a right sceptre. Thou hast loved
righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed
Thee.” <span id="fr_3330"></span>[3331](#fn_3330) For the Spirit
designates both \[of them\] by the name, of God—both Him who is anointed
as Son, and Him who does anoint, that is, the Father. And again: “God
stood in the congregation of the gods, He judges among the gods.” <span
id="fr_3331"></span>[3332](#fn_3331) He \[here\] refers to the Father
and the Son, and those who have received the adoption; but these are the
Church. For she is the synagogue of God, which God—that is, the Son
Himself—has gathered by Himself. Of whom He again speaks: “The God of
gods, the Lord hath spoken, and hath called the earth.” <span
id="fr_3332"></span>[3333](#fn_3332) Who is meant by God? He of whom He
has said, “God shall come openly, our God, and shall not keep
silence;” <span id="fr_3333"></span>[3334](#fn_3333) that is, the Son,
who came manifested to men who said, “I have openly appeared to those
who seek Me not.” <span id="fr_3334"></span>[3335](#fn_3334) But of what
gods \[does he speak\]? \[Of those\] to whom He says, “I have said, Ye
are gods, and all sons of the Most High.” <span
id="fr_3335"></span>[3336](#fn_3335) To those, no doubt, who have
received the grace of the “adoption, by which we cry, Abba
Father.” <span id="fr_3336"></span>[3337](#fn_3336)

<span id="ix.iv.vii-p11"></span>2. <span
id="ix.iv.vii-p11.1"></span>Wherefore, as I have already stated, no
other is named as God, or is called Lord, except Him who is God and Lord
of all, who also said to Moses, “<span class="upper"><span
id="ix.iv.vii-p11.2"></span>I am that I am</span>. And thus shalt thou
say to the children of Israel: He who is, hath sent me unto you;” <span
id="fr_3337"></span>[3338](#fn_3337) and His Son Jesus Christ our Lord,
who makes those that believe in His name the sons of God. And again,
when the Son speaks to Moses, He says, “I am come down to deliver this
people.” <span id="fr_3338"></span>[3339](#fn_3338) For it is He who
descended and ascended for the salvation of men. Therefore God has been
declared through the Son, who is in the Father, and has the Father in
Himself —He who is, the Father bearing witness to the Son, and the Son
announcing the Father.—As also Esaias says, “I too am witness,” he
declares, “saith the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.iv.vii-p13.2"></span>Lord</span> God, and the Son whom I have
chosen, that ye may know, and believe, and understand that I am.” <span
id="fr_3339"></span>[3340](#fn_3339)

<span id="ix.iv.vii-p15"></span>3. <span
id="ix.iv.vii-p15.1"></span>When, however, the Scripture terms them
\[gods\] which are no gods, it does not, as I have already remarked,
declare them as gods in every sense, but with a certain addition and
signification, by which they are shown to be no gods at all. As with
David: “The gods of the heathen are idols of demons;” <span
id="fr_3340"></span>[3341](#fn_3340) and, “Ye shall not follow other
gods.” <span id="fr_3341"></span>[3342](#fn_3341) For in that he says
“the gods of the heathen”—but the heathen are ignorant of the true
God—and calls them “other gods,” he bars their claim \[to be looked
upon\] as gods at all. But as to what they are in their own person, he
speaks concerning them; “for they are,” he says, “the idols of demons.”
And Esaias: “Let them be confounded, all who blaspheme God, and carve
useless things; <span id="fr_3342"></span>[3343](#fn_3342) even I am
witness, saith God.” <span id="fr_3343"></span>[3344](#fn_3343) He
removes them from \[the category of\] gods, but he makes use of the word
alone, for this \[purpose\], that we may know of whom he speaks.
Jeremiah also says the same: “The gods that have not made the heavens
and earth, let them perish from the earth which is under the
heaven.” <span id="fr_3344"></span>[3345](#fn_3344) For, from the fact
of his having subjoined their destruction, he shows them to be no gods
at all. Elias, too, when all Israel was assembled at Mount Carmel,
wishing to turn them from idolatry, says to them, “How long halt ye
between two opinions? <span id="fr_3345"></span>[3346](#fn_3345) If the
<span class="upper"><span id="ix.iv.vii-p21.1"></span>Lord</span> be
God, <span id="fr_3346"></span>[3347](#fn_3346) follow Him.” <span
id="fr_3347"></span>[3348](#fn_3347) And again, at the burnt-offering,
he thus addresses the idolatrous priests: “Ye shall call upon the name
of your gods, and I will call on the name of the <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.iv.vii-p23.2"></span>Lord</span> my God; and
the Lord that will hearken by fire, <span
id="fr_3348"></span>[3349](#fn_3348) He is God.” Now, from the fact of
the prophet having said these words, he proves that these gods which
were reputed so among those men, are no gods at all. He directed them to
that God upon whom he believed, and who was truly God; whom invoking, he
exclaimed, “<span class="upper"><span
id="ix.iv.vii-p24.1"></span>Lord</span> God of Abraham, God of Isaac,
and God of Jacob, hear me to-day, and let all this people know that Thou
art the God of Israel.” <span id="fr_3349"></span>[3350](#fn_3349)

<span id="ix.iv.vii-p26"></span>4. Wherefore I do also call upon thee,
<span class="upper"><span id="ix.iv.vii-p26.1"></span>Lord</span> God of
Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob and Israel, who art the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the God who, through the abundance of
Thy mercy, hast had a favour towards us, that we should know Thee, who
hast made heaven and earth, who rulest over all, who art the only and
the true God, above whom there is none other God; grant, by our Lord
Jesus Christ, the governing power of the Holy Spirit; give to every
reader of this book to know Thee, that Thou art God alone, to be
strengthened in Thee, and to avoid every heretical, and godless, and
impious doctrine.

<span id="ix.iv.vii-p27"></span> <span id="page_420">p. 420</span> <span
id="ix.iv.vii-Page_420"></span> 5. And the Apostle Paul also, saying,
“For though ye have served them which are no gods; ye now know God, or
rather, are known of God,” <span id="fr_3350"></span>[3351](#fn_3350)
has made a separation between those that were not \[gods\] and Him who
is God. And again, speaking of Antichrist, he says, “who opposeth and
exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is
worshipped.” <span id="fr_3351"></span>[3352](#fn_3351) He points out
here those who are called gods, by such as know not God, that is, idols.
For the Father of all is called God, and is so; and Antichrist shall be
lifted up, not above Him, but above those which are indeed called gods,
but are not. And Paul himself says that this is true: “We know that an
idol is nothing, and that there is none other God but one. For though
there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth; yet to us
there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we through
Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by
Him.” <span id="fr_3352"></span>[3353](#fn_3352) For he has made a
distinction, and separated those which are indeed called gods, but which
are none, from the one God the Father, from whom are all things, and, he
has confessed in the most decided manner in his own person, one Lord
Jesus Christ. But in this \[clause\], “whether in heaven or in earth,”
he does not speak of the formers of the world, as these \[teachers\]
expound it; but his meaning is similar to that of Moses, when it is
said, “Thou shalt not make to thyself any image for God, of whatsoever
things are in heaven above, whatsoever in the earth beneath, and
whatsoever in the waters under the earth.” <span
id="fr_3353"></span>[3354](#fn_3353) And he does thus explain what are
meant by the things in heaven: “Lest when,” he says, “looking towards
heaven, and observing the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and all the
ornament of heaven, falling into error, thou shouldest adore and serve
them.” <span id="fr_3354"></span>[3355](#fn_3354) And Moses himself,
being a man of God, was indeed given as a god before Pharaoh; <span
id="fr_3355"></span>[3356](#fn_3355) but he is not properly termed Lord,
nor is called God by the prophets, but is spoken of by the Spirit as
“Moses, the faithful minister and servant of God,” <span
id="fr_3356"></span>[3357](#fn_3356) which also he was.
