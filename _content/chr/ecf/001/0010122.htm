<p><a name="v.i-p1"></A><a name="v.i-p1.1"></A>[<span class="upper"><a name="v.i-p1.2"></A>a.d.</span> 30&#8211;107.] <span class="upper"><a name="v.i-p1.3"></A>The</span> seductive myth which represents this Father as the little child whom the Lord placed in the midst of his apostles (St. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#002">Matt. xviii. 2</a><a name="v.i-p1.4"></A>) indicates at least the period when he may be supposed to have been born. That he and Polycarp were fellow-disciples under St. John, is a tradition by no means inconsistent with anything in the Epistles of either. His subsequent history is sufficiently indicated in the Epistles which follow.</p>  
<p><a name="v.i-p2"></A>Had not the plan of this series been so exclusively that of a mere revised reprint, the writings of Ignatius themselves would have made me diffident as to the undertaking. It seems impossible for any one to write upon the subject of these precious remains, without provoking controversy. This publication is designed as an <i>Eirenicon</i>, and hence &#8220;few words are best,&#8221; from one who might be supposed incapable of an unbiased opinion on most of the points which have been raised in connection with these Epistles. I must content myself therefore, by referring the studious reader to the originals as edited by Bishop Jacobson, with a Latin version and copious annotations. That revered and learned divine honoured me with his friendship; and his precious edition has been my frequent study, with theological students, almost ever since it appeared in 1840. It is by no means superannuated by the vigorous Ignatian literature which has since sprung up, and to which reference will he made elsewhere. But I am content to leave the whole matter, without comment, to the minds of Christians of whatever school and to their independent conclusions. It is a great thing to present them in a single volume with the shorter and longer Epistles duly compared, and with the Curetonian version besides. One luxury only I may claim, to relieve the drudging task-work of a mere reviser. Surely I may point out some of the proverbial wisdom of this great disciple, which has often stirred my soul, as with the trumpet heard by St. John in Patmos. In him, indeed, the lions encountered a lion, one truly begotten of &#8220;the Lion of the tribe of Judah.&#8221; Take, then, as a specimen, these thrilling injunctions from his letter to Polycarp, to whom he bequeathed his own spirit, and in whom he well knew the Church would recognize a sort of survival of St. John himself. If the reader has any true perception of the rhythm and force of the Greek language, let him learn by heart the originals of the following aphorisms:&#8212;</p>  <li> Find time to pray without ceasing. <li> Every wound is not healed with the same remedy.  <li> The times demand thee, as pilots the haven. <li> The crown is immortality.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_480"></A><A HREF="#fn_480"><FONT SIZE="1">481</FONT></A>
  <li> Stand like a beaten anvil.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_481"></A><A HREF="#fn_481"><FONT SIZE="1">482</FONT></A>
  <li> It is the part of a good athlete to be bruised and to prevail.  <A NAME="page_46"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 46</FONT></A> <a name="v.i-Page_46"></A>   <li> Consider the times: look for Him who is above time.  <li> Slight not the menservants and the handmaids.  <li> Let your stewardship define your work. <li>A Christian is not his own master, but waits upon God.  
<p><a name="v.i-p5"></A>Ignatius so delighted in his name Theophorus (sufficiently expounded in his own words to Trajan or his official representative), that it is worth noting how deeply the early Christians felt and believed in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016">2 Cor. vi. 16</a><a name="v.i-p5.1"></A>) the indwelling Spirit.</p>  
<p><a name="v.i-p6"></A>Ignatius has been censured for his language to the Romans, in which he seems to crave martyrdom. But he was already condemned, in law a dead man, and felt himself at liberty to glory in his tribulations. Is it more than modern Christians often too lightly sing? &#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="v.i-p6.1"></A>&#8220;Let cares like a wild deluge come,<br>  And storms of sorrow fall,&#8221; etc.<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="v.i-p7"></A>So the holy martyr adds, &#8220;Only let me attain unto Jesus Christ.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="v.i-p8"></A>The Epistle to the Romans is utterly inconsistent with any conception on his part, that Rome was the see and residence of a bishop holding any other than fraternal relations with himself. It is very noteworthy that it is devoid of expressions, elsewhere made emphatic,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_482"></A><A HREF="#fn_482"><FONT SIZE="1">483</FONT></A>
 which would have been much insisted upon had they been found herein. Think what use would have been made of it, had the words which he addresses to the Smyrn&aelig;ans (chap. viii.) to strengthen their fidelity to Polycarp, been found in this letter to the Romans, especially as in this letter we first find the use of the phrase &#8220;Catholic Church&#8221; in patristic writings. He defines it as to be found &#8220;where Jesus Christ is,&#8221; words which certainly do not limit it to communion with a professed successor of St. Peter.</p>  
<p><a name="v.i-p10"></A>The following is the original <span class="upper"><a name="v.i-p10.1"></A>Introductory Notice</span>:&#8212;</p>  
<p><a name="v.i-p11"></A><span class="upper"><a name="v.i-p11.1"></A>The</span> epistles ascribed to Ignatius have given rise to more controversy than any other documents connected with the primitive Church. As is evident to every reader on the very first glance at these writings, they contain numerous statements which bear on points of ecclesiastical order that have long divided the Christian world; and a strong temptation has thus been felt to allow some amount of prepossession to enter into the discussion of their authenticity or spuriousness. At the same time, this question has furnished a noble field for the display of learning and acuteness, and has, in the various forms under which it has been debated, given rise to not a few works of the very highest ability and scholarship. We shall present such an outline of the controversy as may enable the reader to understand its position at the present day.</p>  
<p><a name="v.i-p12"></A>There are, in all, fifteen Epistles which bear the name of Ignatius. These are the following: One to the Virgin Mary, two to the Apostle John, one to Mary of Cassobel&aelig;, one to the Tarsians, one to the Antiochians, one to Hero, a deacon of Antioch, one to the Philippians; one to the Ephesians, one to the Magnesians, one to the Trallians, one to the Romans, one to the Philadelphians, one to the Smyrn&aelig;ans, and one to Polycarp. The first three exist only in Latin: all the rest are extant also in Greek.</p>  
<p><a name="v.i-p13"></A>It is now the universal opinion of critics, that the first eight of these professedly Ignatian letters are spurious. They bear in themselves indubitable proofs of being the production of a later age than that in which Ignatius lived. Neither Eusebius nor Jerome makes the least reference to them; and they are now by common consent set aside as forgeries, which were at various dates, and to serve special purposes, put forth under the name of the celebrated Bishop of Antioch.</p>  
<p><a name="v.i-p14"></A>But after the question has been thus simplified, it still remains sufficiently complex. Of the seven Epistles which are acknowledged by Eusebius (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i>, iii. 36), we possess two Greek recensions, a shorter and a longer. It is plain that one or other of these exhibits a corrupt text, and  <A NAME="page_47"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 47</FONT></A> <a name="v.i-Page_47"></A>  scholars have for the most part agreed to accept the shorter form as representing the genuine letters of Ignatius. This was the opinion generally acquiesced in, from the time when critical editions of these Epistles began to be issued, down to our own day. Criticism, indeed, fluctuated a good deal as to which Epistles should be accepted and which rejected. Archp. Usher (1644), Isaac Vossius (1646), J. B. Cotelerius (1672), Dr. T. Smith (I709), and others, edited the writings ascribed to Ignatius in forms differing very considerably as to the order in which they were arranged, and the degree of authority assigned them, until at length, from about the beginning of the eighteenth century, the seven Greek Epistles, of which a translation is here given, came to be generally accepted in their <i>shorter</i> form as the genuine writings of Ignatius.</p>  
<p><a name="v.i-p15"></A>Before this date, however, there had not been wanting some who refused to acknowledge the authenticity of these Epistles in either of the recensions in which they were then known to exist. By far the most learned and elaborate work maintaining this position was that of Daill&eacute; (or Dall&aelig;us), published in 1666. This drew forth in reply the celebrated <i>Vindici&aelig;</i> of Bishop Pearson, which appeared in 1672. It was generally supposed that this latter work had established on an immoveable foundation the genuineness of the shorter form of the Ignatian Epistles; and, as we have stated above, this was the conclusion almost universally accepted down to our own day. The only considerable exception to this concurrence was presented by Whiston, who laboured to maintain in his <i>Primitive Christianity Revived</i> (1711) the superior claims of the longer recension of the Epistles, apparently influenced in doing so by the support which he thought they furnished to the kind of Arianism which he had adopted.</p>  
<p><a name="v.i-p16"></A>But although the shorter form of the Ignatian letters had been generally accepted in preference to the longer, there was still a pretty prevalent opinion among scholars, that even it could not be regarded as absolutely free from interpolations, or as of undoubted authenticity. Thus said Lardner, in his <i>Credibility of the Gospel History</i> (1743): &#8220;have carefully compared the two editions, and am very well satisfied, upon that comparison, that the larger are an interpolation of the smaller, and not the smaller an epitome or abridgment of the larger. &#8230; But whether the smaller themselves are the genuine writings of Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, is a question that has been much disputed, and has employed the pens of the ablest critics. And whatever positiveness some may have shown on either side, I must own I have found it a very difficult question.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="v.i-p17"></A>This expression of uncertainty was repeated in substance by Jortin (1751), Mosheim (1755), Griesbach (1768), Rosenm&uuml;ller (1795), Neander (1826), and many others; some going so far as to deny that we have any authentic remains of Ignatius at all, while others, though admitting the seven shorter letters as being probably his, yet strongly suspected that they were not free from interpolation. Upon the whole, however, the shorter recension was, until recently, accepted without much opposition, and chiefly in dependence on the work of Bishop Pearson above mentioned, as exhibiting the genuine form of the Epistles of Ignatius.</p>  
<p><a name="v.i-p18"></A>But a totally different aspect was given to the question by the discovery of a Syriac version of three of these Epistles among the <span class="upper"><a name="v.i-p18.1"></A>mss.</span> procured from the monastery of St. Mary Deipara, in the desert of Nitria, in Egypt. In the years 1838, 1839, and again in 1842, Archdeacon Tattam visited that monastery, and succeeded in obtaining for the English Government a vast number of ancient Syriac manuscripts. On these being deposited in the British Museum,  <A NAME="page_48"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 48</FONT></A> <a name="v.i-Page_48"></A>  the late Dr. Cureton, who then had charge of the Syriac department, discovered among them, first, the Epistle to Polycarp, and then again, the same Epistle, with those to the Ephesians and to the Romans, in two other volumes of manuscripts.</p>  
<p><a name="v.i-p19"></A>As the result of this discovery, Cureton published in 1845 a work, entitled, <i>The Ancient Syriac Version of the Epistles of St. Ignatius to Polycarp, the Ephesian, and the Romans</i>, etc., in which he argued that these Epistles represented more accurately than any formerly published what Ignatius had actually written. This, of course, opened up the controversy afresh. While some accepted the views of Cureton, others very strenuously opposed them. Among the former was the late Chev. Bunsen; among the latter, an anonymous writer in the <i>English Review</i>, and Dr. Hefele, in his third edition of the <i>Apostolic Fathers</i>. In reply to those who had controverted his arguments, Cureton published his <i>Vindici&aelig; Ignatian&aelig;</i> in 1846, and his <i>Corpus Ignatianum</i> in 1849. He begins his introduction to the last-named work with the following sentences: &#8220;Exactly three centuries and a half intervened between the time when three Epistles in Latin, attributed to St. Ignatius, first issued from the press, and the publication in 1845 of three letters in Syriac bearing the name of the same apostolic writer. Very few years passed before the former were almost universally regarded as false and spurious; and it seems not improbable that scarcely a longer period will elapse before the latter be almost as generally acknowledged and received as the only true and genuine letters of the venerable Bishop of Antioch that have either come down to our times, or were ever known in the earliest ages of the Christian Church.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="v.i-p20"></A>Had the somewhat sanguine hope thus expressed been realized, it would have been unnecessary for us to present to the English reader more than a translation of these three Syriac Epistles. But the Ignatian controversy is not yet settled. There are still those who hold that the balance of argument is in favour of the shorter Greek, as against these Syriac Epistles. They regard the latter as an epitome of the former, and think the harshness which, according to them, exists in the sequence of thoughts and sentences, clearly shows that this is the case. We have therefore given all the forms of the Ignatian letters which have the least claim on our attention.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_483"></A><A HREF="#fn_483"><FONT SIZE="1">484</FONT></A>
 The reader may judge, by comparison for himself, which of these is to be accepted as genuine, supposing him disposed to admit the claims of any one of them. We content ourselves with laying the materials for judgment before him, and with referring to the above-named works in which we find the whole subject discussed. As to the personal history of Ignatius, almost nothing is known. The principal source of information regarding him is found in the account of his martyrdom, to which the reader is referred. Polycarp alludes to him in his Epistle to the Philippians (chap. ix.), and also to his letters (chap. xiii.). Iren&aelig;us quotes a passage from his Epistle to the Romans (<i>Adv. H&aelig;r.</i>, v. 28; <i>Epist. ad Rom.</i>, chap. iv.), without, however, naming him. Origen twice refers to him, first in the preface to his Comm. on the Song of Solomon, where he quotes a passage from the Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans, and again in his sixth homily on St. Luke, where he quotes from the Epistle to the Ephesians, both times naming the author. It is unnecessary to give later references.</p>  
<p><a name="v.i-p22"></A><a name="v.i-p22.1"></A><a name="v.i-p22.2"></A>Supposing the letters of Ignatius and the account of his martyrdom to be authentic, we learn from them that he voluntarily presented himself before Trajan at Antioch, the seat of his bishopric, when that prince was on his <i>first</i> expedition against the Parthians and Armenians (<span class="upper"><a name="v.i-p22.3"></A>a.d.</span> 107); and on professing himself a Christian, was condemned to the wild beasts. After a long and dangerous voyage he came to Smyrna, of which Polycarp was bishop, and thence wrote his four Epistles to the Ephesians, the Magnesians, the Trallians, and the Romans. From Smyrna he came to Troas, and tarrying there a few days, he wrote to the Philadelphians, the Smyrn&aelig;ans, and Polycarp. He then came on to Neapolis, and passed through the whole of Macedonia. Finding a ship at Dyrrachium in Epirus about to sail into Italy, he embarked, and crossing the Adriatic, was brought to Rome, where he perished on the 20th of December 107, or, as some think, who deny a twofold expedition of Trajan against the Parthians, on the same day of the year <span class="upper"><a name="v.i-p22.4"></A>a.d.</span> 116.</p>
