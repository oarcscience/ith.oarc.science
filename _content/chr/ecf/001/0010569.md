### <span id="viii.iv.cviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter CVIII.—The resurrection of Christ did not convert the Jews. But through the whole world they have sent men to accuse Christ.

though all the men of your nation knew the incidents in the life of
Jonah, and though Christ said amongst you that He would give the sign of
Jonah, exhorting you to repent of your wicked deeds at least after He
rose again from the dead, and to mourn before God as did the Ninevites,
in order that your nation and city might not be taken and destroyed, as
they have been destroyed; yet you not only have not repented, after you
learned that He rose from the dead, but, as I said before <span
id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362) you have sent chosen and ordained
men throughout all the world to proclaim that a godless and lawless
heresy had sprung from one Jesus, a Galilæan deceiver, whom we
crucified, but his disciples stole him by night from the tomb, where he
was laid when unfastened from the cross, and now deceive men by
asserting that he has risen from the dead and ascended to heaven. <span
id="viii.iv.cviii-p2.1"></span>Moreover, you accuse Him of having taught
those godless, lawless, and unholy doctrines which you mention to the
condemnation of those who confess Him to be Christ, and a Teacher from
and Son of God. Besides this, even when your city is captured, and your
land ravaged, you do not repent, but dare to utter imprecations on Him
and all who believe in Him. Yet we do not hate you or those who, by your
means, have conceived such prejudices against us; but we pray that even
now all of you may repent and obtain mercy from God, the compassionate
and long-suffering Father of all.
