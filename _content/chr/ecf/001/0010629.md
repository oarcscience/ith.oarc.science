### <span id="viii.vi.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Testimony of Pythagoras.

<span id="viii.vi.xix-p1"></span><span

Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, who expounded the doctrines of his own
philosophy, mystically by means of symbols, as those who have written
his life show, himself seems to have entertained thoughts about the
unity of God not unworthy of his foreign residence in Egypt. For when he
says that unity is the first principle of all things, and that it is the
cause of all good, he teaches by an allegory that God is one, and
alone. <span id="fr_2544"></span>[2545](#fn_2544) And that this is so,
is evident from his saying that <span id="page_281">p. 281</span> <span
id="viii.vi.xix-Page_281"></span> unity and one differ widely from one
another. For he says that unity belongs to the class of things perceived
by the mind, but that one belongs to numbers. And if you desire to see a
clearer proof of the opinion of Pythagoras concerning one God, hear his
own opinion, for he spoke as follows: “God is one; and He Himself does
not, as some suppose, exist outside the world, but in it, He being
wholly present in the whole circle, and beholding all generations; being
the regulating ingredient of all the ages, and the administrator of His
own powers and works, the first principle of all things, the light of
heaven, and Father of all, the intelligence and animating soul of the
universe, the movement of all orbits.” Thus, then, Pythagoras.
