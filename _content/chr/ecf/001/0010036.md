### <span id="ii.ii.xxxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—Let us see by what means we may obtain the divine blessing.

<span id="ii.ii.xxxi-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Let us
cleave then to His blessing, and consider what are the means <span
id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123) of possessing it. Let us think <span
id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124) over the things which have taken place
from the beginning. <span id="ii.ii.xxxi-p3.1"></span>For what reason
was our father Abraham blessed? was it not because he wrought
righteousness and truth through faith? <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125) <span
id="ii.ii.xxxi-p4.2"></span>Isaac, with perfect confidence, as if
knowing what was to happen, <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126)
cheerfully yielded himself as a sacrifice. <span
id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127) <span
id="ii.ii.xxxi-p6.2"></span>Jacob, through reason <span
id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128) of his brother, went forth with
humility from his own land, and came to Laban and served him; and there
was given to him the sceptre of the twelve tribes of Israel.
