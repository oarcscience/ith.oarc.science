### <span id="v.xix.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Acknowledgment of her excellence and wisdom.

<span id="v.xix.i-p1"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.xix.i-p1.1"></span>Sight</span> indeed is better than writing,
inasmuch as, being one <span id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374) of the
company of the senses, it not only, by communicating proofs of
friendship, honours him who receives them, but also, by those which it
in turn receives, enriches the desire for better things. But the second
harbour of refuge, as the phrase runs, is the practice of writing, which
we have received, as a convenient haven, by thy faith, from so great a
distance, seeing that by means of a letter we have learned the
excellence that is in thee. For the souls of the good, O thou
wisest <span id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375) of women! resemble
fountains of the purest water; for they allure by their beauty
passers-by to drink of them, even though these should not be thirsty.
And thy intelligence invites us, as by a word of command, to participate
in those divine draughts which gush forth so abundantly in thy soul.
