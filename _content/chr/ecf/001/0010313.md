### <span id="v.xix.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—His own condition.

<span id="v.xix.ii-p1"></span>But I, O thou blessed woman, not being now
so much my own master as in the power of others, am driven along by the
varying wills of many adversaries, <span
id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376) being in one sense in exile, in
another in prison, and in a third in bonds. But I pay no regard to these
things. Yea, by the injuries inflicted on me through them, I acquire all
the more the character of a disciple, that I may attain to Jesus Christ.
May I enjoy the torments which are prepared for me, seeing that “the
sufferings of this present time are not worthy \[to be compared\] with
the glory which shall be revealed in us.” <span
id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377)
