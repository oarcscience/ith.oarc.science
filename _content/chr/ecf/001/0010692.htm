<p><a name="viii.xi.iv-p1"></A>The prefect says to Justin, &#8220;Hearken, you who are called learned, and think that you know true doctrines; if you are scourged and beheaded, do you believe you will ascend into heaven?&#8221; Justin said, &#8220;I hope that, if I endure these things, I shall have His gifts.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2645"></A><A HREF="#fn_2645"><FONT SIZE="1">2646</FONT></A>
 For I know that, to all who have thus lived, there abides the divine favour until the completion of the whole world.&#8221; Rusticus the prefect said, &#8220;Do you suppose, then, that you will ascend into heaven to receive some recompense?&#8221; Justin said, &#8220;I do not suppose it, but I know and am fully persuaded of it.&#8221; Rusticus the prefect said, &#8220;Let us, then, now come to the matter in hand, and which presses. Having come together, offer sacrifice with one accord to the gods.&#8221; Justin said, &#8220;No right-thinking person falls away from piety to impiety.&#8221; Rusticus the prefect said, &#8220;Unless ye obey, ye shall be mercilessly punished.&#8221; Justin said, &#8220;Through prayer we can be saved on account of our Lord Jesus Christ, even when we have been punished,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2646"></A><A HREF="#fn_2646"><FONT SIZE="1">2647</FONT></A>
 because this shall become to us salvation and confidence at the more fearful and universal judgment-seat of our Lord and Saviour.&#8221; Thus also said the other martyrs: &#8220;Do what you will, for we are Christians, and do not sacrifice to idols.&#8221;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="viii.xi.iv-p2"></A> Another reading is <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.xi.iv-p2.1"></A>&#948;&#8057;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>, which may be translated, &#8220;I shall have what He teaches [us to expect].&#8221;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="viii.xi.iv-p3"></A> This passage admits of another rendering. Lord Hailes, following the common Latin version, thus translates: &#8220;It was our chief wish to endure tortures for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ, and so to be saved.&#8221;</p>
