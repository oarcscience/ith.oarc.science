<p> <a name="viii.ii.xxxv"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.ii.xxxv-p0.1"></A>Chapter XXXV.&#8212;Other fulfilled prophecies.</h3>  
<p><a name="viii.ii.xxxv-p1"></A><a name="viii.ii.xxxv-p1.1"></A>And how Christ after He was born was to escape the notice of other men until He grew to man&#146;s estate, which also came to pass, hear what was foretold regarding this. <a name="viii.ii.xxxv-p1.2"></A><a name="viii.ii.xxxv-p1.3"></A>There are the following predictions:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1833"></A><A HREF="#fn_1833"><FONT SIZE="1">1834</FONT></A>
&#8212;&#8220;Unto us a child is born, and unto us a young man is given, and the government shall be upon His shoulders;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1834"></A><A HREF="#fn_1834"><FONT SIZE="1">1835</FONT></A>
 which is significant of the power of the cross, for to it, when He was crucified, He applied His shoulders, as shall be more clearly made out in the ensuing discourse. And again the same prophet Isaiah, being inspired by the prophetic Spirit, said, &#8220;I have spread out my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people, to those who walk in a way that is not good. They now ask of me judgment, and dare to draw near to God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1835"></A><A HREF="#fn_1835"><FONT SIZE="1">1836</FONT></A>
 And again in other words, through another prophet, He says, &#8220;They pierced My hands and My feet, and for My vesture they cast lots.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1836"></A><A HREF="#fn_1836"><FONT SIZE="1">1837</FONT></A>
 And indeed David, the king and prophet, who uttered these things, suffered none of them; but Jesus Christ stretched forth His hands, being crucified by the Jews speaking against Him, and denying that He was the Christ. And as the prophet spoke, they tormented Him, and set Him on the judgment-seat, and said, Judge us. And the expression, &#8220;They pierced my hands and my feet,&#8221; was used in reference to the nails of the cross which were fixed in His hands and feet. And after He was crucified they cast lots upon His vesture, and they  <A NAME="page_175"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 175</FONT></A> <a name="viii.ii.xxxv-Page_175"></A>  that crucified Him parted it among them. And that these things did happen, you can ascertain from the Acts of Pontius Pilate.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1837"></A><A HREF="#fn_1837"><FONT SIZE="1">1838</FONT></A>
 <a name="viii.ii.xxxv-p6.2"></A>And we will cite the prophetic utterances of another prophet, Zephaniah,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1838"></A><A HREF="#fn_1838"><FONT SIZE="1">1839</FONT></A>
 to the effect that He was foretold expressly as to sit upon the foal of an ass and to enter Jerusalem. The words are these: &#8220;Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1839"></A><A HREF="#fn_1839"><FONT SIZE="1">1840</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="viii.ii.xxxv-p2"></A> These predictions have so little reference to the point Justin intends to make out, that some editors have supposed that a passage has here been lost. Others think the irrelevancy an insufficient ground for such a supposition. [See below, cap. xl.]</p>

These Acts of Pontius Pilate, or regular accounts of his procedure sent by Pilate to the Emperor Tiberius, are supposed to have been destroyed at an early period, possibly in consequence of the unanswerable appeals which the Christians constantly made to them. There exists a forgery in imitation of these Acts. See Trollope.</p>
