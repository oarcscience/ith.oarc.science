### <span id="viii.iv.li-p0.1"></span>Chapter LI.—It is proved that this prophecy has been fulfilled.

<span id="viii.iv.li-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv.li-p1.1"></span>And
when I ceased, Trypho said, “All the words of the prophecy you repeat,
sir, are ambiguous, <span id="page_221">p. 221</span> <span
id="viii.iv.li-Page_221"></span> and have no force in proving what you
wish to prove.” Then I answered, <span id="viii.iv.li-p1.2"></span>“If
the prophets had not ceased, so that there were no more in your nation,
Trypho, after this John, it is evident that what I say in reference to
Jesus Christ might be regarded perhaps as ambiguous. But if John came
first calling on men to repent, and Christ, while \[John\] still sat by
the river Jordan, having come, put an end to his prophesying and
baptizing, and preached also Himself, saying that the kingdom of heaven
is at hand, and that He must suffer many things from the Scribes and
Pharisees, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again, and would
appear again in Jerusalem, and would again eat and drink with His
disciples; and foretold that in the interval between His \[first and
second\] advent, as I previously said, <span
id="fr_2108"></span>[2109](#fn_2108) priests and false prophets would
arise in His name, which things do actually appear; then how can they be
ambiguous, when you may be persuaded by the facts? Moreover, He referred
to the fact that there would be no longer in your nation any prophet,
and to the fact that men recognised how that the New Testament, which
God formerly announced \[His intention of\] promulgating, was then
present, i.e., Christ Himself; and in the following terms: ‘The law and
the prophets were until John the Baptist; from that time the kingdom of
heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. And if you
can <span id="fr_2109"></span>[2110](#fn_2109) receive it, he is Elijah,
who was to come. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.’ <span
id="fr_2110"></span>[2111](#fn_2110)
