### <span id="iv.iv.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Subject of which we write.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p1"></span><span id="iv.iv.i-p1.1"></span>We have
written to you, brethren, as to what relates to the martyrs, and
especially to the blessed Polycarp, who put an end to the persecution,
having, as it were, set a seal upon it by his martyrdom. For almost all
the events that happened previously \[to this one\], took place that the
Lord might show us from above a martyrdom becoming the Gospel. For he
waited to be delivered up, even as the Lord had done, that we also might
become his followers, while we look not merely at what concerns
ourselves but have regard also to our neighbours. For it is the part of
a true and well-founded love, not only to wish one’s self to be saved,
but also all the brethren.
