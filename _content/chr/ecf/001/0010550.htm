<p> <a name="viii.iv.lxxxix"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.iv.lxxxix-p0.1"></A>Chapter LXXXIX.&#8212;The cross alone is offensive to Trypho on account of the curse, yet it proves that Jesus is Christ.</h3>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.lxxxix-p1"></A>Then Trypho remarked, &#8220;Be assured that all our nation waits for Christ; and we admit that all the Scriptures which you have quoted refer to Him. Moreover, I do also admit that the name of Jesus, by which the the son of Nave (Nun) was called, has inclined me very strongly to adopt this view. But whether Christ should be so shamefully crucified, this we are in doubt about. For whosoever is crucified is said in the law to be accursed, so that I am exceedingly incredulous on this point. It is quite clear, indeed, that the Scriptures announce that Christ had to suffer; but we wish to learn if you can prove it to us whether it was by the suffering cursed in the law.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.lxxxix-p2"></A>I replied to him, &#8220;If Christ was not to suffer, and the prophets had not foretold that He would be led to death on account of the sins of the people, and be dishonoured and scourged, and reckoned among the transgressors, and as a sheep be led to the slaughter, whose generation, the prophet says, no man can declare, then you would have good cause to wonder. But if these are to be characteristic of Him and mark Him out to all, how is it possible for us to do anything else than believe in Him most confidently? And will not as many as have understood the writings of the prophets, whenever they hear merely that He was crucified, say that this is He and no other?&#8221;</p>
