<p><a name="v.xviii.iv-p1"></A>Moreover, the wise Daniel, while he was a young man, passed judgment on certain vigorous old man,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1364"></A><A HREF="#fn_1364"><FONT SIZE="1">1365</FONT></A>
 showing them that they were abandoned wretches, and not [worthy to be reckoned] elders, and that, though Jews by extraction, they were Canaanites in practice. And Jeremiah, when on account of his youth he declined the office of a prophet entrusted to him by God, was addressed in these words: &#8220;Say not, I am a youth; for thou shalt go to all those to whom I send thee, and thou shalt speak according to all that I command thee; because I am with thee.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1365"></A><A HREF="#fn_1365"><FONT SIZE="1">1366</FONT></A>
 And the wise Solomon, when only in the twelfth year of his age,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1366"></A><A HREF="#fn_1366"><FONT SIZE="1">1367</FONT></A>
 had wisdom to decide the important question concerning the children of the two women,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1367"></A><A HREF="#fn_1367"><FONT SIZE="1">1368</FONT></A>
 when it was unknown to whom these respectively belonged; so that the whole people were astonished at such wisdom in a child, and venerated him as being not a mere youth, but a full-grown man. And he solved the hard questions of the queen of the Ethiopians, which had profit in them as the streams of the Nile [have fertility], in such a manner that that woman,  <A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A> <a name="v.xviii.iv-Page_121"></A>  though herself so wise, was beyond measure astonished.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1368"></A><A HREF="#fn_1368"><FONT SIZE="1">1369</FONT></A>
