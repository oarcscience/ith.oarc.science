### <span id="v.v.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—By death I shall attain true life.

<span id="v.v.vi-p1"></span><span id="v.v.vi-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.v.vi-p1.2"></span>All the pleasures of the world, and all the
kingdoms of this earth, <span id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859) shall
profit me nothing. <span id="v.v.vi-p2.1"></span>It is better for me to
die in behalf of <span id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860) Jesus Christ,
than to reign over all the ends of the earth. “For what shall a man be
profited, if he gain the whole world, but lose his own soul?” <span
id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861) Him I seek, who died for us: Him I
desire, who rose again for our sake. This is the gain which is laid up
for me. Pardon me, brethren: do not hinder me from living, do not wish
to keep me in a state of death; <span id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862)
and while I desire to belong to God, do not ye give me over to the
world. Suffer me to obtain pure light: when I have gone thither, I shall
indeed be a man of God. <span id="v.v.vi-p5.1"></span>Permit me to be an
imitator of the passion of my God. If any one has Him within himself,
let him consider what I desire, and let him have sympathy with me, as
knowing how I am straitened.

<span id="v.v.vi-p6"></span><span id="v.v.vi-p6.1"></span><span
id="v.v.vi-p6.2"></span>All the ends of the world, and all the kingdoms
of this earth, <span id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863) shall profit me
nothing. <span id="v.v.vi-p7.1"></span>It is better for me to die for
the sake of Jesus Christ, than to reign over all the ends of the earth.
“For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, but lose his
own soul?” <span id="v.v.vi-p7.2"></span>I long after the Lord, the Son
of the true God and Father, even Jesus Christ. Him I seek, who died for
us and rose again. Pardon me, brethren: do not hinder me in attaining to
life; for Jesus is the life of believers. Do not wish to keep me in a
state of death, <span id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864) for life without
Christ is death. While I desire to belong to God, do not ye give me over
to the world. Suffer me to obtain pure light: when I have gone thither,
I shall indeed be a man of God. <span id="v.v.vi-p8.1"></span>Permit me
to be an imitator of the passion of Christ, my God. If any one has Him
within himself, let him consider what I desire, and let him have
sympathy with me, as knowing how I am straitened.
