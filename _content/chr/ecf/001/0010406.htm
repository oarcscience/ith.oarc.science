<p><a name="viii.ii.xxxiii-p1"></A><a name="viii.ii.xxxiii-p1.1"></A><a name="viii.ii.xxxiii-p1.2"></A><a name="viii.ii.xxxiii-p1.3"></A>And hear again how Isaiah in express words foretold that He should be born of a virgin; for he spoke thus: &#8220;Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bring forth a son, and they shall say for His name, &#145;God with us.&#146; &#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1829"></A><A HREF="#fn_1829"><FONT SIZE="1">1830</FONT></A>
 For things which were incredible and seemed impossible with men, these God predicted by the Spirit of prophecy as about to come to pass, in order that, when they came to pass, there might be no unbelief, but faith, because of their prediction. But lest some, not understanding the prophecy now cited, should charge us with the very things we have been laying to the charge of the poets who say that Jupiter went in to women through lust, let us try to explain the words. This, then, &#8220;Behold, a virgin shall conceive,&#8221; signifies that a virgin should conceive without intercourse. For if she had had intercourse with any one whatever, she was no longer a virgin; but the power of God having come upon the virgin, overshadowed her, and caused her while yet a virgin to conceive. And the angel of God who was sent to the same virgin at that time brought her good news, saying, &#8220;Behold, thou shalt conceive of the Holy Ghost, and shalt bear a Son, and He shall be called the Son of the Highest, and thou shalt call His name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their sins,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1830"></A><A HREF="#fn_1830"><FONT SIZE="1">1831</FONT></A>
&#8212;as they who have recorded all that concerns our Saviour Jesus Christ have taught, whom we believed, since by Isaiah also, whom we have now adduced, the Spirit of prophecy declared that He should be born as we intimated before. <a name="viii.ii.xxxiii-p3.3"></A>It is wrong, therefore, to understand the Spirit and the power of God as anything else than the Word, who is also the first-born of God, as the foresaid prophet Moses declared; and it was this which, when it came upon the virgin and overshadowed her, caused her to conceive, not by intercourse, but by power. And the name Jesus in the Hebrew language means <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.ii.xxxiii-p3.4"></A>&#931;&#969;&#964;&#8053;&#961;</span> (Saviour) in the Greek tongue. Wherefore, too, the angel said to the virgin, &#8220;Thou shalt call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins.&#8221; And that the prophets are inspired&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1831"></A><A HREF="#fn_1831"><FONT SIZE="1">1832</FONT></A>
 by no other than the Divine Word, even you, as I fancy, will grant.</p>
