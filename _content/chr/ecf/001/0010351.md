### <span id="vi.ii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—The false and the true Sabbath.

<span id="vi.ii.xv-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xv-p1.1"></span><span
id="vi.ii.xv-p1.2"></span><span id="vi.ii.xv-p1.3"></span>Further, <span
id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653) also, it is written concerning the
Sabbath in the Decalogue which \[the Lord\] spoke, face to face, to
Moses on Mount Sinai, “And sanctify ye the Sabbath of the Lord with
clean hands and a pure heart.” <span
id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654) And He says in another place, “If
my sons keep the Sabbath, then will I cause my mercy to rest upon
them.” <span id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655) The Sabbath is
mentioned at the beginning of the creation \[thus\]: “And God made in
six days the works of His hands, and made an end on the seventh day, and
rested on it, and sanctified it.” <span
id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656) Attend, my children, to the meaning
of this expression, “He finished in six days.” This implieth that the
Lord will finish all things in six thousand years, for a day is <span
id="fr_1657"></span>[1658](#fn_1657) with Him a thousand years. And He
Himself testifieth, <span id="fr_1658"></span>[1659](#fn_1658) saying,
“Behold, to-day <span id="fr_1659"></span>[1660](#fn_1659) will be as a
thousand years.” <span id="fr_1660"></span>[1661](#fn_1660) Therefore,
my children, in six days, that is, in six thousand years, all things
will be finished. “And He rested on the seventh day.” This meaneth: when
His Son, coming \[again\], shall destroy the time of the wicked
man, <span id="fr_1661"></span>[1662](#fn_1661) and judge the ungodly,
and change the-sun, and the moon, <span
id="fr_1662"></span>[1663](#fn_1662) and the stars, then shall He truly
rest on the seventh day. Moreover, He says, “Thou shalt sanctify it with
pure hands and a pure heart.” If, therefore, any one can now sanctify
<span id="page_147">p. 147</span> <span id="vi.ii.xv-Page_147"></span>
the day which God hath sanctified, except he is pure in heart in all
things, <span id="fr_1663"></span>[1664](#fn_1663) we are
deceived. <span id="fr_1664"></span>[1665](#fn_1664) Behold,
therefore: <span id="fr_1665"></span>[1666](#fn_1665) certainly then one
properly resting sanctifies it, when we ourselves, having received the
promise, wickedness no longer existing, and all things having been made
new by the Lord, shall be able to work righteousness. <span
id="fr_1666"></span>[1667](#fn_1666) Then we shall be able to sanctify
it, having been first sanctified ourselves. <span
id="fr_1667"></span>[1668](#fn_1667) Further, He says to them, “Your new
moons and your Sabbath I cannot endure.” <span
id="fr_1668"></span>[1669](#fn_1668) Ye perceive how He speaks: Your
present Sabbaths are not acceptable to Me, but that is which I have
made, \[namely this,\] when, giving rest to all things, I shall make a
beginning of the eighth day, that is, a beginning of another world.
Wherefore, also, we keep the eighth day with joyfulness, the day also on
which Jesus rose again from the dead. <span
id="fr_1669"></span>[1670](#fn_1669) And <span
id="fr_1670"></span>[1671](#fn_1670) when He had manifested Himself, He
ascended into the heavens.

Hebrew text is here followed, the Septuagint reading “sixth” instead of
“seventh.”

<span id="vi.ii.xv-p7"></span> Cod. Sin. adds, “to me.”

<span id="vi.ii.xv-p10"></span> Cod. Sin. seems properly to omit “of the
wicked man.”

id="vi.ii.xv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.xv-p11"></span> Cod. Sin. places *stars* before *moon*.

<span id="vi.ii.xv-p12"></span> Cod. Sin. reads “again,” but is
corrected as above.

<span id="fn_1664"></span>[147:1665](0010351.htm#fr_1664) <span
id="vi.ii.xv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.xv-p13"></span> The meaning is, “If the Sabbaths of the
Jews were the true Sabbath, we should have been deceived by God, who
demands pure hands and a pure heart.”—<span class="upper"><span
id="vi.ii.xv-p13.1"></span>Hefele</span>.

<span id="fn_1665"></span>[147:1666](0010351.htm#fr_1665) <span
id="vi.ii.xv-p13.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.xv-p14"></span> Cod. Sin. has, “But if not.”
Hilgenfeld’s text of this confused passage reads as follows: “Who then
can sanctify the day which God has sanctified, except the man who is of
a pure heart? We are deceived (or mistaken) in all things. Behold,
therefore,” etc.

<span id="fn_1666"></span>[147:1667](0010351.htm#fr_1666) <span
id="vi.ii.xv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.xv-p15"></span> Cod. Sin. reads, “resting aright, we
shall sanctify it, having been justified, and received the promise,
iniquity no longer existing, but all things having been made new by the
Lord.”

<span id="fn_1667"></span>[147:1668](0010351.htm#fr_1667) <span
id="vi.ii.xv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.xv-p16"></span> Cod. Sin. reads, “Shall we not then?”

id="vi.ii.xv-p17.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.xv-p18"></span> “Barnabas here bears testimony to the
observance of the Lord’s Day in early times.”—<span class="upper"><span
id="vi.ii.xv-p18.1"></span>Hefele</span>.

<span id="fn_1670"></span>[147:1671](0010351.htm#fr_1670) <span
id="vi.ii.xv-p18.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.xv-p19"></span> We here follow the punctuation of
Dressel: Hefele places only a comma between the clauses, and inclines to
think that the writer implies that the ascension of Christ took place on
the first day of the week.
