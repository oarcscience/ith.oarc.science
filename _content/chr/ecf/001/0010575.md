### <span id="viii.iv.cxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXIV.—Some rules for discerning what is said about Christ. The circumcision of the Jews is very different from that which Christians receive.

<span id="viii.iv.cxiv-p1"></span>“For the Holy Spirit sometimes brought
about that something, which was the type of the future, should be done
clearly; sometimes He uttered words about what was to take place, as if
it was then taking place, or had taken place. And unless those who read
perceive this art, they will not be able to follow the words of the
prophets as they ought. For example’s sake, I shall repeat some
prophetic passages, that you may understand what I say. When He speaks
by Isaiah, ‘He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb
before the shearer,’ <span id="fr_2375"></span>[2376](#fn_2375) He
speaks as if the suffering had already taken place. And when He says
again, ‘I have stretched out my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying
people;’ <span id="fr_2376"></span>[2377](#fn_2376) and when He says,
‘Lord, who hath believed our report?’ <span
id="fr_2377"></span>[2378](#fn_2377) —the words are spoken as if
announcing events which had already come to pass. For I have shown that
Christ is oftentimes called a Stone in parable, and in figurative speech
Jacob and Israel. And again, when He says, ‘I shall behold the heavens,
the works of Thy fingers,’ <span id="fr_2378"></span>[2379](#fn_2378)
unless I understand His method of using words, <span
id="fr_2379"></span>[2380](#fn_2379) I shall not understand
intelligently, but just as your teachers suppose, fancying that the
Father of all, the unbegotten God, has hands and feet, and fingers, and
a soul, like a composite being; and they for this reason teach that it
was the Father Himself who appeared to Abraham and to Jacob. <span
id="viii.iv.cxiv-p6.4"></span><span id="viii.iv.cxiv-p6.5"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxiv-p6.6"></span>Blessed therefore are we who have been
circumcised the second time with knives of stone. For your first
circumcision was and is performed by iron instruments, for you remain
hard-hearted; but our circumcision, which is the second, having been
instituted after yours, circumcises us from idolatry and from absolutely
every kind of wickedness by sharp stones, i.e., by the words
\[preached\] by the apostles of the corner-stone cut out without hands.
And our hearts are thus circumcised from evil, so that we are happy to
die for the name of the good Rock, which causes living water to burst
forth for the hearts of those who by Him have loved the Father of all,
and which gives those who are willing to drink of the water of life. But
you do not comprehend me when I speak these things; for you have not
understood what it has been prophesied that Christ would do, and you do
not believe us who draw your attention to what has been written. For
Jeremiah thus cries: ‘Woe unto you! because you have forsaken the living
fountain, and have digged for yourselves broken cisterns that can hold
no water. Shall there be a wilderness where Mount Zion is, because I
gave Jerusalem a bill of divorce in your sight?’ <span
