### <span id="ix.vii.xxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—The preservation of our bodies is confirmed by the resurrection and ascension of Christ: the souls of the saints during the intermediate period are in a state of expectation of that time when they shall receive their perfect and consummated glory.

<span id="ix.vii.xxxii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Since, again, some who are reckoned among
the orthodox go beyond the pre-arranged plan for the exaltation of the
just, and are ignorant of the methods by which they are disciplined
beforehand for incorruption, they thus entertain heretical opinions. For
the heretics, despising the handiwork of God, and not admitting the
salvation of their flesh, while they also treat the promise of God
contemptuously, and pass beyond God altogether in the sentiments they
form, affirm that immediately upon their death they shall pass above the
heavens and the Demiurge, and go to the Mother (Achamoth) or to that
Father whom they have feigned. Those persons, therefore, who disallow a
resurrection affecting the whole man (*universam reprobant
resurrectionem*), and as far as in them lies remove it from the midst
\[of the Christian scheme\], how can they be wondered at, if again they
know nothing as to the plan of the resurrection? For they do not choose
to understand, that if these things are as they say, the Lord Himself,
in whom they profess to believe, did not rise again upon the third day;
but immediately upon His expiring on the cross, undoubtedly departed on
high, leaving His body to the earth. But the case was, that for three
days He dwelt in the place where the dead were, as the prophet says
concerning Him: “And the Lord remembered His dead saints who slept
formerly in the land of sepulture; and He descended to them, to rescue
and save them.” <span id="fr_4709"></span>[4710](#fn_4709) And the Lord
Himself says, “As Jonas remained three days and three nights in the
whale’s belly, so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the
earth.” <span id="fr_4710"></span>[4711](#fn_4710) Then also the apostle
says, “But when He ascended, what is it but that He also descended into
the lower parts of the earth?” <span
id="fr_4711"></span>[4712](#fn_4711) This, too, David says when
prophesying of Him, “And thou hast delivered my soul from the nethermost
hell;” <span id="fr_4712"></span>[4713](#fn_4712) and on His rising
again the third day, He said to Mary, who was the first to see and to
worship Him, “Touch Me not, for I have not yet ascended to the Father;
but go to the disciples, and say unto them, I ascend unto My Father, and
unto your Father.” <span id="fr_4713"></span>[4714](#fn_4713)

<span id="ix.vii.xxxii-p7"></span>2. <span
id="ix.vii.xxxii-p7.1"></span>If, then, the Lord observed the law of the
dead, that He might become the first-begotten from the dead, and tarried
until the third day “in the lower parts of the earth;” <span
id="fr_4714"></span>[4715](#fn_4714) then afterwards rising in the
flesh, so that He even showed the print of the nails to His
disciples, <span id="fr_4715"></span>[4716](#fn_4715) He thus ascended
to the Father;—\[if all these things occurred, I say\], how must these
men not be put to confusion, who allege that “the lower parts” refer to
this world of ours, but that their inner man, leaving the body here,
ascends into the super-celestial place? For as the Lord “went away in
the midst of the shadow of death,” <span
id="fr_4716"></span>[4717](#fn_4716) where the souls of the dead were,
yet afterwards arose in the body, and after the resurrection was taken
up \[into heaven\], it is manifest that the souls of His disciples also,
upon whose account the Lord underwent these things, shall go away into
the invisible place allotted to them by God, and there remain until the
resurrection, awaiting that event; then receiving their bodies, and
rising in their entirety, that is bodily, just as the Lord arose, they
shall come thus into the presence of God. “For no disciple is above the
Master, but every one that is perfect shall be as his Master.” <span
id="fr_4717"></span>[4718](#fn_4717) As our Master, therefore, did not
at once depart, taking flight \[to heaven\], but awaited the time of His
resurrection prescribed by the Father, which had been also shown forth
through Jonas, and rising again after three days was taken up \[to
heaven\]; <span id="page_561">p. 561</span> <span
id="ix.vii.xxxii-Page_561"></span> so ought we also to await the time of
our resurrection prescribed by God and foretold by the prophets, and so,
rising, be taken up, as many as the Lord shall account worthy of this
\[privilege\]. <span id="fr_4718"></span>[4719](#fn_4718)

<span id="ix.vii.xxxii-p12"></span> The five following chapters were
omitted in the earlier editions, but added by Feuardentius. Most <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vii.xxxii-p12.1"></span>mss.</span>, too, did
not contain them. It is probable that the scribes of the middle ages
rejected them on account of their inculcating millenarian notions, which
had been long extinct in the Church. Quotations from these five chapters
have been collected by Harvey from Syriac and Armenian <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vii.xxxii-p12.2"></span>mss.</span> lately
come to light.
