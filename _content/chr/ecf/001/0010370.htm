<p><a name="vii.ii.x-p2"></A><a name="vii.ii.x-p2.1"></A><a name="vii.ii.x-p2.2"></A>(1.) Mary the mother of the Lord; (2.) Mary the wife of Cleophas or Alph&aelig;us, who was the mother of James the bishop and apostle, and of Simon and Thaddeus, and of one Joseph; (3.) Mary Salome, wife of Zebedee, mother of John the evangelist and James; (4.) Mary Magdalene. These four are found in the Gospel. James and Judas and Joseph were sons of an aunt (2) of the Lord&#146;s. James also and John were sons of another aunt (3) of the Lord&#146;s. Mary (2), mother of James the Less and Joseph, wife of Alph&aelig;us was the sister of Mary the mother of the Lord, whom John names of Cleophas, either from her father or from the family of the clan, or for some other reason. Mary Salome (3) is called Salome either from her husband or her village. Some affirm that she is the same as Mary of Cleophas, because she had two husbands.</p>
