### <span id="viii.ii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—The resurrection possible.

<span id="viii.ii.xix-p1"></span>And to any thoughtful person would
anything appear more incredible, than, if we were not in the body, and
some one were to say that it was possible that from a small drop of
human seed bones and sinews and flesh be formed into a shape such as we
see? For let this now be said hypothetically: if you yourselves were not
such as you now are, and born of such parents \[and causes\], and one
were to show you human seed and a picture of a man, and were to say with
confidence that from such a substance such a being could be produced,
would you believe before you saw the actual production? No one will dare
to deny \[that such a statement would surpass belief\]. In the same way,
then, you are now incredulous because you have never seen a dead man
rise again. But as at first you would not have believed it possible that
such persons could be produced from the small drop, and yet now you see
them thus produced, so also judge ye that it is not impossible that the
bodies of men, after they have been dissolved, and like seeds resolved
into earth, should in God’s appointed time rise again and put on
incorruption. For what power worthy of God those imagine who say, that
each thing returns to that from which it was produced, and that beyond
this not even God Himself can do anything, we are unable to conceive;
but this we see clearly, that they would not have believed it possible
that they could have become such and produced from such materials, as
they now see both themselves and the whole world to be. And that it is
better to believe even what is impossible to our own nature and to men,
than to be unbelieving like the rest of the world, we have learned; for
we know that our Master Jesus Christ said, that “what is impossible with
men is possible with God,” <span id="fr_1808"></span>[1809](#fn_1808)
and, “Fear not them that kill you, and after that can do no more; but
fear Him who after death is able to cast both soul and body into
hell.” <span id="fr_1809"></span>[1810](#fn_1809) And hell is a place
where those are to be punished who have lived wickedly, and who do not
believe that those things which God has taught us by Christ will come to
pass.
