### <span id="viii.iv.xcvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XCVII.—Other predictions of the cross of Christ.

<span id="viii.iv.xcvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xcvii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xcvii-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.iv.xcvii-p1.3"></span>“For
it was not without design that the prophet Moses, when Hur and Aaron
upheld his hands, remained in this form until evening. For indeed the
Lord remained upon the tree almost until evening, and they buried Him at
eventide; then on the third day He rose again. This was declared by
David thus: ‘With my voice I cried to the Lord, and He heard me out of
His holy hill. I laid me down, and slept; I awaked, for the Lord
sustained me.’ <span id="fr_2319"></span>[2320](#fn_2319) And Isaiah
likewise mentions concerning Him the manner in which He would die, thus:
‘I have spread out My hands unto a people disobedient, and gainsaying,
that walk in a way which is not good.’ <span
id="fr_2320"></span>[2321](#fn_2320) And that He would rise again,
Isaiah himself said: ‘His burial has been taken away from the midst, and
I will give the rich for His death.’ <span
id="fr_2321"></span>[2322](#fn_2321) And again, in other words, David in
the twenty-first <span id="fr_2322"></span>[2323](#fn_2322) Psalm thus
refers to the suffering and to the cross in a parable of mystery: ‘They
pierced my hands and my feet; they counted all my bones. They considered
and gazed on me; they parted my garments among themselves, and cast lots
upon my vesture.’ For when they crucified Him, driving in the nails,
they pierced His hands and feet; and those who crucified Him parted
<span id="page_248">p. 248</span> <span
id="viii.iv.xcvii-Page_248"></span> His garments among themselves, each
casting lots for what he chose to have, and receiving according to the
decision of the lot. And this very Psalm you maintain does not refer to
Christ; for you are in all respects blind, and do not understand that no
one in your nation who has been called King or Christ has ever had his
hands or feet pierced while alive, or has died in this mysterious
fashion—to wit, by the cross—save this Jesus alone.
