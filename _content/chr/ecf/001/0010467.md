### <span id="viii.iv.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—These things were unknown to Plato and other philosophers.

<span id="viii.iv.vi-p1"></span>“ ‘It makes no matter to me,’ said he,
‘whether Plato or Pythagoras, or, in short, any other man held such
opinions. For the truth is so; and you would perceive it from this.
<span id="viii.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>The soul assuredly is or has life. If,
then, it is life, it would cause something else, and not itself, to
live, even as motion would move something else than itself. Now, that
the soul lives, no one would deny. But if it lives, it lives not as
being life, but as the partaker of life; but that which partakes of
anything, is different from that of which it does partake. Now the soul
partakes of life, since God wills it to live. Thus, then, it will not
even partake \[of life\] when God does not will it to live. <span
id="viii.iv.vi-p1.2"></span>For to live is not its attribute, as it is
God’s; but as a man does not live always, and the soul is not for ever
conjoined with the body, since, whenever this harmony must be broken up,
the soul leaves the body, and the man exists no longer; even so,
whenever the soul must cease to exist, the spirit of life is removed
from it, and there is no more soul, but it goes back to the place from
whence it was taken.’
