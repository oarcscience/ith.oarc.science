<p> <a name="v.xvi.iv"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="v.xvi.iv-p0.1"></A>Chapter IV.&#8212;Servants and women are not to be despised.</h3>  
<p><a name="v.xvi.iv-p1"></A>Be not ashamed of servants, for we possess the same nature in common with them. Do not hold women in abomination, for they have given thee birth, and brought thee up. It is fitting, therefore, to love those that were the authors of our birth (but only in the Lord), inasmuch as a man can produce no children without a woman. It is right, therefore, that we should honour those who have had a part in giving us birth. &#8220;Neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1282"></A><A HREF="#fn_1282"><FONT SIZE="1">1283</FONT></A>
 except in the case of those who were first formed. For the body of Adam was made out of the four elements, and that of Eve out of the side of Adam. And, indeed, the altogether peculiar birth of the Lord was of a virgin alone. [This took place] not as if the lawful union [of man and wife] were abominable, but such a kind of birth was fitting to God. For it became the Creator not to make use of the ordinary method of generation, but of one that was singular and strange, as being the Creator.</p>
