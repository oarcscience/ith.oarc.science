### <span id="viii.iv.lxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXXII.—Passages have been removed by the Jews from Esdras and Jeremiah.

<span id="viii.iv.lxxii-p1"></span>And I said, “I shall do as you
please. From the statements, then, which Esdras made in reference to the
law of the passover, they have taken away the following: ‘And Esdras
said to the people, This passover is our Saviour and our refuge. And if
you have understood, and your heart has taken it in, that we shall
humble Him on a standard, and <span id="fr_2217"></span>[2218](#fn_2217)
thereafter hope in Him, then this place shall not be forsaken for ever,
says the God of hosts. But if you will not believe Him, and will not
listen to His declaration, you shall be a laughing-stock to the
nations.’ <span id="fr_2218"></span>[2219](#fn_2218) And from the
sayings of Jeremiah they have cut out the following: ‘I \[was\] like a
lamb that is brought to the slaughter: they devised a device against me,
saying, Come, let us lay on wood on His bread, and let us blot Him out
from the land of the living; and His name shall no more be
remembered.’ <span id="fr_2219"></span>[2220](#fn_2219) <span
id="viii.iv.lxxii-p4.2"></span>And since this passage from the sayings
of Jeremiah is still written in some copies <span id="page_235">p.
235</span> <span id="viii.iv.lxxii-Page_235"></span> \[of the
Scriptures\] in the synagogues of the Jews (for it is only a short time
since they were cut out), and since from these words it is demonstrated
that the Jews deliberated about the Christ Himself, to crucify and put
Him to death, He Himself is both declared to be led as a sheep to the
slaughter, as was predicted by Isaiah, and is here represented as a
harmless lamb; but being in a difficulty about them, they give
themselves over to blasphemy. And again, from the sayings of the same
Jeremiah these have been cut out: ‘The Lord God remembered His dead
people of Israel who lay in the graves; and He descended to preach to
them His own salvation.’ <span id="fr_2220"></span>[2221](#fn_2220)
