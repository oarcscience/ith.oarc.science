### <span id="v.iii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Honour your youthful bishop.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p1"></span><span id="v.iii.iii-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.iii.iii-p1.2"></span><span id="v.iii.iii-p1.3"></span>Now it
becomes you also not to treat your bishop too familiarly on account of
his youth, <span id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642) but to yield him all
reverence, having respect to <span id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643) the
power of God the Father, as I have known even holy presbyters do, not
judging rashly, from the manifest youthful appearance <span
id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644) \[of their bishop\], but as being
themselves prudent in God, submitting to him, or rather not to him, but
to the Father of Jesus Christ, the bishop of us all. It is therefore
fitting that you should, after no hypocritical fashion, obey \[your
bishop\], in honour of Him who has willed us \[so to do\], since he that
does not so deceives not \[by such conduct\] the bishop that is visible,
but seeks to mock Him that is invisible. And all such conduct has
reference not to man, <span id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645) but to
God, who knows all secrets.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p6"></span><span id="v.iii.iii-p6.1"></span><span
id="v.iii.iii-p6.2"></span><span id="v.iii.iii-p6.3"></span>Now it
becomes you also not to despise the age of your bishop, but to yield him
all reverence, according to the will of God the Father, as I have known
even holy presbyters do, not having regard to the manifest youth \[of
their bishop\], but to his knowledge in God; inasmuch as “not the
ancient are \[necessarily\] wise, nor do the aged understand prudence;
but there is a spirit in men.” <span id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646)
<span id="v.iii.iii-p7.2"></span>For Daniel the wise, at twelve years of
age, became possessed of the divine Spirit, and convicted the elders,
who in vain carried their grey hairs, of being false accusers, and of
lusting after the beauty of another man’s wife. <span
id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647) <span
id="v.iii.iii-p8.2"></span>Samuel also, when he was but a little child,
reproved Eli, who was ninety years old, for giving honour to his sons
rather than to God. <span id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648) <span
id="v.iii.iii-p9.2"></span>In like manner, Jeremiah also received this
message from God, “Say not, I am a child.” <span
id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649) Solomon too, and Josiah, \[exemplified
the same thing.\] The former, being made king at twelve years of age,
gave that terrible and difficult judgment in the case of the two women
concerning their children. <span id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650) The
latter, coming to the throne when eight years old <span
id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651) cast down the altars and temples \[of
the idols\], and burned down the groves, for they were dedicated to
demons, and not to God. And he slew the false priests, as the corrupters
and deceivers of men, and not the worshippers of the Deity. Wherefore
youth is not to be despised when it is devoted to God. But he is to be
despised who is of a wicked mind, although he be old, and full of wicked
days. <span id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652) Timothy the Christ-bearer
was young, but hear what his teacher writes to him: “Let no man despise
thy youth, but be thou an example of the believers in word and in
conduct.” <span id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653) It is becoming,
therefore, that ye also should be obedient to your bishop, and
contradict him in nothing; for it is a fearful thing to contradict any
such person. For no one does \[by such conduct\] deceive him that is
visible, but does \[in reality\] seek to mock Him that is invisible,
who, however, cannot be mocked by any one. And every such act has
respect not to man, but to God. <span id="v.iii.iii-p14.2"></span>For
God says to Samuel, “They have not mocked thee, but Me.” <span
id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654) And Moses declares, “For their
murmuring is not against us, but against the Lord God.” <span
id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655) No one of those has, \[in fact,\]
remained unpunished, who rose up against their superiors. For Dathan and
Abiram did not speak against the law, but against Moses, <span
id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656) and were cast down alive into Hades.
Korah also, <span id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657) and the two hundred
and fifty who conspired with him against Aaron, were destroyed by fire.
Absalom, again, <span id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658) who had slain
his brother, became suspended on a tree, and had his evil-designing
heart thrust through with darts. In like manner was Abeddadan <span
id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659) beheaded for the same reason.
Uzziah, <span id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660) when he presumed to
oppose the priests and the priesthood, was smitten with leprosy. <span
id="v.iii.iii-p21.2"></span>Saul also was dishonoured, <span
id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661) because he did not wait for Samuel the
high priest. It behoves you, therefore, also to reverence your
superiors.
