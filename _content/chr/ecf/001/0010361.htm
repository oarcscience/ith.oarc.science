<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p2"></A>[<span class="upper"><a name="vii.ii.i-p2.1"></A>The</span> writings of Papias in common circulation are five in number, and these are called an Exposition of the Oracles of the Lord. Iren&aelig;us makes mention of these as the only works written by him, in the following words: &#8220;Now testimony is borne to these things in writing by Papias, an ancient man, who was a hearer of John, and a friend of Polycarp, in the fourth of his books; for five books were composed by him.&#8221; Thus wrote Iren&aelig;us. Moreover, Papias himself, in the introduction to his books, makes it manifest that he was not himself a hearer and eye-witness of the holy apostles; but he tells us that he received the truths of our religion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1734"></A><A HREF="#fn_1734"><FONT SIZE="1">1735</FONT></A>
 from those who were acquainted with them [the apostles] in the following words:]</p>  
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p4"></A>But I shall not be unwilling to put down, along with my interpretations,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1735"></A><A HREF="#fn_1735"><FONT SIZE="1">1736</FONT></A>
 whatsoever instructions I received with care at any time from the elders, and stored up with care in my memory, assuring you at the same time of their truth. For I did not, like the multitude, take pleasure in those who spoke much, but in those who taught the truth; nor in those who related strange commandments,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1736"></A><A HREF="#fn_1736"><FONT SIZE="1">1737</FONT></A>
 but in those who rehearsed the commandments given by the Lord to faith,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1737"></A><A HREF="#fn_1737"><FONT SIZE="1">1738</FONT></A>
 and proceeding from truth itself. If, then, any one who had attended on the elders came, I asked minutely after their sayings,&#8212;what Andrew or Peter said, or what was said by Philip, or by Thomas, or by James, or by John, or by Matthew, or by any other of the Lord&#146;s disciples: which things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1738"></A><A HREF="#fn_1738"><FONT SIZE="1">1739</FONT></A>
 Aristion and the presbyter John, the disciples of the Lord, say. For I imagined that what was to be got from books was not so profitable to me as what came from the living and abiding voice.</p>

But the words more naturally mean, that John and Aristion, even at the time of his writing, were telling him some of the sayings of the Lord.</p>
