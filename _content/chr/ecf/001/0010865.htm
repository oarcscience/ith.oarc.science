<p> <a name="ix.vii.xxviii"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="ix.vii.xxviii-p0.1"></A>Chapter XXVII.&#8212;The future judgment by Christ. Communion with and separation from the divine being. The eternal punishment of unbelievers.</h3>  
<p><a name="ix.vii.xxviii-p1"></A>1. <a name="ix.vii.xxviii-p1.1"></A>If the Father, then, does not exercise judgment, [it follows] that judgment does not belong to Him, or that He consents to all those actions which take place; and if He does not judge, all persons will be equal, and accounted in the same condition. The advent of Christ will therefore be without an object, yea, absurd, inasmuch as [in that case] He exercises no judicial power. For &#8220;He came to divide a man against his father, and the daughter against the mother, and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4682"></A><A HREF="#fn_4682"><FONT SIZE="1">4683</FONT></A>
 and when two are in one bed, to take the one, and to leave the other; and of two women grinding at the mill, to take one and leave the other:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4683"></A><A HREF="#fn_4683"><FONT SIZE="1">4684</FONT></A>
 [also] at the time of the end, to order the reapers to collect first the tares together, and bind them in bundles, and burn them with unquenchable fire, but to gather up the wheat into the barn;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4684"></A><A HREF="#fn_4684"><FONT SIZE="1">4685</FONT></A>
 and to call the lambs into the kingdom prepared for them, but to send the goats into everlasting fire, which has been prepared by His Father for the devil and his angels.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4685"></A><A HREF="#fn_4685"><FONT SIZE="1">4686</FONT></A>
 And why is this? Has the Word come for the ruin and for the resurrection of many? For the ruin, certainly, of those who do not believe Him, to whom also He has threatened a greater damnation in the judgment-day than that of Sodom and Gomorrah;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4686"></A><A HREF="#fn_4686"><FONT SIZE="1">4687</FONT></A>
 but for the resurrection of believers, and those who do the will of His Father in heaven. If then the advent of the Son comes indeed alike to all, but is for the purpose of judging, and separating the believing from the unbelieving, since, as those who believe do His will agreeably to their own choice, and as, [also] agreeably to their own choice, the disobedient do not consent to His doctrine; it is manifest that His Father has made all in a like condition, each person having a choice of his own, and a free understanding; and that He has regard to all things, and exercises a providence over all, &#8220;making His sun to rise upon the evil and on the good, and sending rain upon the just and unjust.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4687"></A><A HREF="#fn_4687"><FONT SIZE="1">4688</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="ix.vii.xxviii-p8"></A>2. <a name="ix.vii.xxviii-p8.1"></A><a name="ix.vii.xxviii-p8.2"></A>And to as many as continue in their love towards God, does He grant communion with Him. But communion with God is life and light, and the enjoyment of all the benefits which He has in store. But on as many as, according to their own choice, depart from God, He inflicts that separation from Himself which they have chosen of their own accord. But separation from God is death, and separation from light is darkness; and separation from God consists in the loss of all the benefits which He has in store. Those, therefore, who cast away by apostasy these forementioned things, being in fact destitute of all good, do experience every kind of punishment. God, however, does not punish them immediately of Himself, but that punishment falls upon them because they are destitute of all that is good. <a name="ix.vii.xxviii-p8.3"></A>Now, good things are eternal and without end with God, and therefore the loss of these is also eternal and never-ending. It is in this matter just as occurs in the case of a flood of light: those who have blinded themselves, or have been blinded by others, are for ever deprived of the enjoyment of light. It is not, [however], that the light has inflicted upon them the penalty of blindness, but it is that the blindness itself has brought calamity upon them: and therefore the Lord declared, &#8220;He that believeth in Me is not condemned,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4688"></A><A HREF="#fn_4688"><FONT SIZE="1">4689</FONT></A>
 that is, is not separated from God, for he is united to God through faith. On the other hand, He says, &#8220;He that believeth not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God;&#8221; that is, he separated himself from God of his own accord. &#8220;For this is the condemnation, that light is come into this world, and men have loved darkness rather than light. For every one who doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that he has wrought them in God.&#8221;</p>
