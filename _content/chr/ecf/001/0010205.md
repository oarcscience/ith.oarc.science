### <span id="v.vii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI—Unbelievers in the blood of Christ shall be condemned.

<span id="v.vii.vi-p1"></span>Let no man deceive himself. <span
id="v.vii.vi-p1.1"></span><span id="v.vii.vi-p1.2"></span><span
id="v.vii.vi-p1.3"></span>Both the things which are in heaven, and the
glorious angels, <span id="fr_1007"></span>[1008](#fn_1007) and rulers,
both visible and invisible, if they believe not in the blood of Christ,
shall, in <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> <span
id="v.vii.vi-Page_89"></span> consequence, incur condemnation. <span
id="fr_1008"></span>[1009](#fn_1008) “He that is able to receive it, let
him receive it.” <span id="fr_1009"></span>[1010](#fn_1009) Let not
\[high\] place puff any one up: for that which is worth all is <span
id="fr_1010"></span>[1011](#fn_1010) faith and love, to which nothing is
to be preferred. But consider those who are of a different opinion with
respect to the grace of Christ which has come unto us, how opposed they
are to the will of God. <span id="v.vii.vi-p5.1"></span>They have no
regard for love; no care for the widow, or the orphan, or the oppressed;
of the bond, or of the free; of the hungry, or of the thirsty.

<span id="v.vii.vi-p6"></span>Let no man deceive himself. <span
id="v.vii.vi-p6.1"></span><span id="v.vii.vi-p6.2"></span><span
id="v.vii.vi-p6.3"></span><span id="v.vii.vi-p6.4"></span><span
id="v.vii.vi-p6.5"></span>Unless he believes that Christ Jesus has lived
in the flesh, and shall confess His cross and passion, and the blood
which He shed for the salvation of the world, he shall not obtain
eternal life, whether he be a king, or a priest, or a ruler, or a
private person, a master or a servant, a man or a woman. “He that is
able to receive it, let him receive it.” <span
id="fr_1011"></span>[1012](#fn_1011) Let no man’s place, or dignity, or
riches, puff him up; and let no man’s low condition or poverty abase
him. <span id="v.vii.vi-p7.2"></span>For the chief points are faith
towards God, hope towards Christ, the enjoyment of those good things for
which we look, and love towards God and our neighbour. For, “Thou shall
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as
thyself.” <span id="fr_1012"></span>[1013](#fn_1012) <span
id="v.vii.vi-p8.2"></span>And the Lord says, “This is life eternal, to
know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent.” <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[1014](#fn_1013) And again, “A new commandment give
I unto you, that ye love one another. On these two commandments hang all
the law and the prophets.” <span id="fr_1014"></span>[1015](#fn_1014)
<span id="v.vii.vi-p10.3"></span>Do ye, therefore, notice those who
preach other doctrines, how they affirm that the Father of Christ cannot
be known, and how they exhibit enmity and deceit in their dealings with
one another. They have no regard for love; they despise the good things
we expect hereafter; they regard present things as if they were durable;
they ridicule him that is in affliction; they laugh at him that is in
bonds.
