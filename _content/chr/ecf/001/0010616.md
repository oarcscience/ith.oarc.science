### <span id="viii.vi.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Further disagreements between Plato and Aristotle.

<span id="viii.vi.vi-p1"></span><span id="viii.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>And
that these very wonderful sages of yours do not even agree in other
respects, can be easily learned from this. For while Plato says that
there are three first principles of all things, God, and matter, and
form,—God, the maker of all; and matter, which is the subject of the
first production of all that is produced, and affords to God opportunity
for His workmanship; and form, which is the type of each of the things
<span id="page_276">p. 276</span> <span id="viii.vi.vi-Page_276"></span>
produced,— Aristotle makes no mention at all of form as a first
principle, but says that there are two, God and matter. And again, while
Plato says that the highest God and the ideas exist in the first place
of the highest heavens, and in fixed sphere, Aristotle says that, next
to the most high God, there are, not ideas, but certain gods, who can be
perceived by the mind. Thus, then, do they differ concerning things
heavenly. So that one can see that they not only are unable to
understand our earthly matters, but also, being at variance among
themselves regarding these things, they will appear unworthy of credit
when they treat of things heavenly. And that even their doctrine
regarding the human soul as it now is does not harmonize, is manifest
from what has been said by each of them concerning it. For Plato says
that it is of three parts, having the faculty of reason, of affection,
and of appetite. <span id="fr_2526"></span>[2527](#fn_2526) But
Aristotle says that the soul is not so comprehensive as to include also
corruptible parts, but only reason. And Plato loudly maintains that “the
whole soul is immortal.” But Aristotle, naming it “the actuality,” <span
id="fr_2527"></span>[2528](#fn_2527) would have it to be mortal, not
immortal. And the former says it is always in motion; but Aristotle says
that it is immoveable, since it must itself precede all motion.
