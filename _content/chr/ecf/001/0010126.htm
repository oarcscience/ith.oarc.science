<p><a name="v.ii.iii-p1"></A><a name="v.ii.iii-p1.1"></A><a name="v.ii.iii-p1.2"></A>I do not issue orders to you, as if I were some great person. <a name="v.ii.iii-p1.3"></A>For though I am bound for the name [of Christ], I am not yet perfect in Jesus Christ. For now I begin to be a disciple, and I speak to you as fellow-disciples with me. For it was needful for me to have been stirred up by you in faith, exhortation, patience, and long-suffering. <a name="v.ii.iii-p1.4"></A>But inasmuch as love suffers me not to be silent in regard to you, I have therefore taken&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="#fn_510"><FONT SIZE="1">511</FONT></A>
 upon me first to exhort you that ye would all run together in accordance with the will of God. For even Jesus Christ, our inseparable life, is the [manifested] will of the Father; as also bishops, settled everywhere to the utmost bounds [of the earth], are so by the will of Jesus Christ.</p>  
<p><a name="v.ii.iii-p3"></A><a name="v.ii.iii-p3.1"></A><a name="v.ii.iii-p3.2"></A>I do not issue orders to you, as if I were some great person. <a name="v.ii.iii-p3.3"></A>For though I am bound for His name, I am not yet perfect in Jesus Christ. For now I begin to be a disciple, and I speak to you as my fellow-servants. For it was needful for me to have been admonished by you in faith, exhortation, patience, and long-suffering. <a name="v.ii.iii-p3.4"></A>But inasmuch as love suffers me not to be silent in regard to you, I have therefore taken&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">512</FONT></A>
 upon me first to exhort you that ye would run together in accordance with the will of God. For even Jesus Christ does all things according to the will of the Father, as He Himself declares in a certain place, &#8220;I do always those things that please Him.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_512"></A><A HREF="#fn_512"><FONT SIZE="1">513</FONT></A>
 <a name="v.ii.iii-p5.2"></A><a name="v.ii.iii-p5.3"></A>Wherefore it behoves us also to live according to the will of God in Christ, and to imitate Him as Paul did. For, says he, &#8220;Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_513"></A><A HREF="#fn_513"><FONT SIZE="1">514</FONT></A>
