### <span id="viii.vi.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II—The poets are unfit to be religious teachers.

<span id="viii.vi.ii-p1"></span><span id="viii.vi.ii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.ii-p1.2"></span>Whom, then, ye men of Greece, do ye call
your teachers of religion? The poets? It will do your cause no good to
say so to men who know the poets; for they know how very ridiculous a
theogony they have composed,—as we can learn from Homer, your most
distinguished and prince of poets. For he says, first, that the gods
were in the beginning generated from water; for he has written
thus: <span id="fr_2507"></span>[2508](#fn_2507) —

> <span id="viii.vi.ii-p2.1"></span>“Both ocean, the origin of the gods,
> and their mother Tethys”  

<span id="viii.vi.ii-p3"></span>And then we must also remind you of what
he further says of him whom ye consider the first of the gods, and whom
he often calls “the father of gods and men;” for he said: <span
id="fr_2508"></span>[2509](#fn_2508) —

> <span id="viii.vi.ii-p4.1"></span>“Zeus, who is the dispenser of war
> to men.”  

<span id="viii.vi.ii-p5"></span>Indeed, he says that he was not only the
dispenser of war to the army, but also the cause of perjury to the
Trojans, by means of his daughter; <span
id="fr_2509"></span>[2510](#fn_2509) and Homer introduces him in love,
and bitterly complaining, and bewailing himself, and plotted against by
the other gods, and at one time exclaiming concerning his own son: <span
id="fr_2510"></span>[2511](#fn_2510) —

> <span id="viii.vi.ii-p7.1"></span>“Alas! he falls, my most beloved of
> men!  
> Sarpedon, vanquished by Patroclus, falls.  
> So will the fates.”  

<span id="viii.vi.ii-p8"></span>And at another time concerning
Hector: <span id="fr_2511"></span>[2512](#fn_2511) —

> <span id="viii.vi.ii-p9.1"></span>“Ah! I behold a warrior dear to me  
> Around the walls of Ilium driven, and grieve  
> For Hector.”  

<span id="viii.vi.ii-p10"></span>And what he says of the conspiracy of
the other gods against Zeus, they know who read these words: <span
id="fr_2512"></span>[2513](#fn_2512) “When the other Olympians—Juno, and
Neptune, and Minerva —wished to bind him.” And unless the blessed gods
had feared him whom gods call Briareus, Zeus would have been bound by
them. And what Homer says of his intemperate loves, we must remind you
in the very words he used. For he said that Zeus spake thus to
Juno: <span id="fr_2513"></span>[2514](#fn_2513) — <span
id="page_274">p. 274</span> <span id="viii.vi.ii-Page_274"></span>

> <span id="viii.vi.ii-p12.1"></span>“For never goddess pour’d, nor
> woman yet,  
> So full a tide of love into my breast;  
> I never loved Ixion’s consort thus,  
> Nor sweet Acrisian Danaë, from whom  
> Sprang Perseus, noblest of the race of man;  
> Nor Phœnix’ daughter fair, of whom were born  
> Minos, unmatch’d but by the powers above,  
> And Rhadamanthus; nor yet Semele,  
> Nor yet Alcmene, who in Thebes produced  
> The valiant Hercules; and though my son  
> By Semele were Bacchus, joy of man;  
> Nor Ceres golden-hair’d, nor high-enthron’d  
> Latona in the skies; no—nor thyself  
> As now I love thee, and my soul perceive  
> O’erwhelm’d with sweetness of intense desire.”  

<span id="viii.vi.ii-p13"></span>It is fit that we now mention what one
can learn from the work of Homer of the other gods, and what they
suffered at the hands of men. For he says that Mars and Venus were
wounded by Diomed, and of many others of the gods he relates the
sufferings. For thus we can gather from the case of Dione consoling her
daughter; for she said to her: <span
id="fr_2514"></span>[2515](#fn_2514) —

> <span id="viii.vi.ii-p14.1"></span>“Have patience, dearest child;
> though much enforc’d  
> Restrain thine anger: we, in heav’n who dwell,  
> Have much to bear from mortals; and ourselves  
> Too oft upon each other suff’rings lay:  
> Mars had his suff’rings; by Alöeus sons,  
> Otus and Ephialtes, strongly bound,  
> He thirteen months in brazen fetters lay:  
> Juno, too, suffer’d, when Amphitryon’s son  
> Thro’ her right breast a three-barb’d arrow sent:  
> Dire, and unheard of, were the pangs she bore,  
> Great Pluto’s self the stinging arrow felt,  
> When that same son of Ægis-bearing Jove  
> Assail’d him in the very gates of hell,  
> And wrought him keenest anguish; pierced with pain,  
> To high Olympus, to the courts of Jove,  
> Groaning, he came; the bitter shaft remain’d  
> Deep in his shoulder fix’d, and griev’d his soul.”  

<span id="viii.vi.ii-p15"></span>But if it is right to remind you of the
battle of the gods, opposed to one another, your own poet himself will
recount it, saying: <span id="fr_2515"></span>[2516](#fn_2515) —

> <span id="viii.vi.ii-p16.1"></span>“Such was the shock when gods in
> battle met;  
> For there to royal Neptune stood oppos’d  
> Phœbus Apollo with his arrows keen;  
> The blue-eyed Pallas to the god of war;  
> To Juno, Dian, heav’nly archeress,  
> Sister of Phœbus, golden-shafted queen.  
> Stout Hermes, helpful god, Latona fac’d.”  

<span id="viii.vi.ii-p17"></span>These and such like things did Homer
teach you; and not Homer only, but also Hesiod. So that if you believe
your most distinguished poets, who have given the genealogies of your
gods, you must of necessity either suppose that the gods are such beings
as these, or believe that there are no gods at all.
