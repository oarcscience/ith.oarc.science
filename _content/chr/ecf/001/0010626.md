### <span id="viii.vi.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Testimony of the Sibyl.

<span id="viii.vi.xvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.xvi-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.vi.xvi-p1.2"></span>We must
also mention what the ancient and exceedingly remote Sibyl, whom Plato
and Aristophanes, and others besides, mention as a prophetess, taught
you in her oracular verses concerning one only God. And she speaks
thus:—

> <span id="viii.vi.xvi-p1.3"></span>“There is one only unbegotten
> God,  
> Omnipotent, invisible, most high,  
> All-seeing, but Himself seen by no flesh.”  

<span id="viii.vi.xvi-p2"></span>Then elsewhere thus:—

> <span id="viii.vi.xvi-p2.1"></span>“But we have strayed from the
> Immortal’s ways,  
> And worship with a dull and senseless mind  
> Idols, the workmanship of our own hands,  
> And images and figures of dead men.”  

<span id="viii.vi.xvi-p3"></span>And again somewhere else:—

> <span id="viii.vi.xvi-p3.1"></span>“Blessed shall be those men upon
> the earth  
> Who shall love the great God before all else,  
> Blessing Him when they eat and when they drink;  
> Trusting it, this their piety alone.  
> Who shall abjure all shrines which they may see,  
> All altars and vain figures of dumb stones,  
> Worthless and stained with blood of animals,  
> And sacrifice of the four-fooled tribes,  
> Beholding the great glory of One God.”  

<span id="viii.vi.xvi-p4"></span>These are the Sibyl’s words.
