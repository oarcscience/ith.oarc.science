<span id="ix.viii.xlviii-p1"></span>As <span
id="fr_4895"></span>[4896](#fn_4895) therefore seventy tongues are
indicated by number, and from <span id="fr_4896"></span>[4897](#fn_4896)
dispersion the tongues are gathered into one by means of their
interpretation; so is that ark declared a type of the body of Christ,
which is both pure and immaculate. For <span
id="fr_4897"></span>[4898](#fn_4897) as that ark was gilded with pure
gold both within and without, so also is the body of Christ pure and
resplendent, being adorned within by the Word, and shielded on the
outside by the Spirit, in order that from both \[materials\] the
splendour of the natures might be exhibited together.
