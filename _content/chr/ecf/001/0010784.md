<span id="ix.iv.xviii"></span>

### <span id="ix.iv.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—The apostles teach that it was neither Christ nor the Saviour, but the Holy Spirit, who did descend upon Jesus. The reason for this descent.

<span id="ix.iv.xviii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.iv.xviii-p1.2"></span><span
id="ix.iv.xviii-p1.3"></span>It certainly was in the power of the
apostles to declare that Christ descended upon Jesus, or that the
so-called superior Saviour \[came down\] upon the dispensational one, or
he who is from the invisible places upon him from the Demiurge; but they
neither knew nor said anything of the kind: for, had they known it, they
would have also certainly stated it. But what really was the case, that
did they record, \[namely,\] that the Spirit of God as a dove descended
upon Him; this Spirit, of whom it was declared by Isaiah, “And the
Spirit of God shall rest upon Him,” <span
id="fr_3613"></span>[3614](#fn_3613) as I have already said. And again:
“The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me.” <span
id="fr_3614"></span>[3615](#fn_3614) That is the Spirit of whom the Lord
declares, “For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father
which speaketh in you.” <span id="fr_3615"></span>[3616](#fn_3615) And
again, giving to the disciples the power of regeneration into God, <span
id="fr_3616"></span>[3617](#fn_3616) He said to them, “Go and teach all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost.” <span id="fr_3617"></span>[3618](#fn_3617) For
\[God\] promised, that in the last times He would pour Him \[the
Spirit\] upon \[His\] servants and handmaids, that they might prophesy;
wherefore He did also descend upon the Son of God, made the Son of man,
becoming accustomed in fellowship with Him to dwell in the human race,
to rest with human beings, and to dwell in the workmanship of God,
working the will of the Father in them, and renewing them from their old
habits into the newness of Christ.

<span id="ix.iv.xviii-p7"></span>2. This Spirit did David ask for the
human race, saying, “And stablish me with Thine all-governing
Spirit;” <span id="fr_3618"></span>[3619](#fn_3618) who also, as Luke
says, descended at the day of Pentecost upon the disciples after the
Lord’s ascension, having power to admit all nations to the entrance of
life, and to the opening of the new covenant; from whence also, with one
accord in all languages, they uttered praise to God, the Spirit bringing
distant tribes to unity, and offering to the Father the first-fruits of
all nations. Wherefore also the Lord promised to send the
Comforter, <span id="fr_3619"></span>[3620](#fn_3619) who should join us
to God. For as a compacted lump of dough cannot be formed of dry wheat
<span id="page_445">p. 445</span> <span
id="ix.iv.xviii-Page_445"></span> without fluid matter, nor can a loaf
possess unity, so, in like manner, neither could we, being many, be made
one in Christ Jesus without the water from heaven. And as dry earth does
not bring forth unless it receive moisture, in like manner we also,
being originally a dry tree, could never have brought forth fruit unto
life without the voluntary rain from above. For our bodies have received
unity among themselves by means of that laver which leads to
incorruption; but our souls, by means of the Spirit. Wherefore both are
necessary, since both contribute towards the life of God, our Lord
compassionating that erring Samaritan woman <span
id="fr_3620"></span>[3621](#fn_3620) —who did not remain with one
husband, but committed fornication by \[contracting\] many marriages—by
pointing out, and promising to her living water, so that she should
thirst no more, nor occupy herself in acquiring the refreshing water
obtained by labour, having in herself water springing up to eternal
life. The Lord, receiving this as a gift from His Father, does Himself
also confer it upon those who are partakers of Himself, sending the Holy
Spirit upon all the earth.

<span id="ix.iv.xviii-p11"></span>3. <span
id="ix.iv.xviii-p11.1"></span>Gideon, <span
id="fr_3621"></span>[3622](#fn_3621) that Israelite whom God chose, that
he might save the people of Israel from the power of foreigners,
foreseeing this gracious gift, changed his request, and prophesied that
there would be dryness upon the fleece of wool (a type of the people),
on which alone at first there had been dew; thus indicating that they
should no longer have the Holy Spirit from God, as saith Esaias, “I will
also command the clouds, that they rain no rain upon it,” <span
id="fr_3622"></span>[3623](#fn_3622) but that the dew, which is the
Spirit of God, who descended upon the Lord, should be diffused
throughout all the earth, “the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the
spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and piety, the
spirit of the fear of God.” <span id="fr_3623"></span>[3624](#fn_3623)
This Spirit, again, He did confer upon the Church, sending throughout
all the world the Comforter from heaven, from whence also the Lord tells
us that the devil, like lightning, was cast down. <span
id="fr_3624"></span>[3625](#fn_3624) Wherefore we have need of the dew
of God, that we be not consumed by fire, nor be rendered unfruitful, and
that where we have an accuser there we may have also an Advocate, <span
id="fr_3625"></span>[3626](#fn_3625) the Lord commending to the Holy
Spirit His own man, <span id="fr_3626"></span>[3627](#fn_3626) who had
fallen among thieves, <span id="fr_3627"></span>[3628](#fn_3627) whom He
Himself compassionated, and bound up his wounds, giving two royal
*denaria*; so that we, receiving by the Spirit the image and
superscription of the Father and the Son, might cause the *denarium*
entrusted to us to be fruitful, counting out the increase \[thereof\] to
the Lord. <span id="fr_3628"></span>[3629](#fn_3628)

<span id="ix.iv.xviii-p20"></span>4. The Spirit, therefore, descending
under the predestined dispensation, and the Son of God, the
Only-begotten, who is also the Word of the Father, coming in the fulness
of time, having become incarnate in man for the sake of man, and
fulfilling all the conditions of human nature, our Lord Jesus Christ
being one and the same, as He Himself the Lord doth testify, as the
apostles confess, and as the prophets announce,—all the doctrines of
these men who have invented putative Ogdoads and Tetrads, and imagined
subdivisions \[of the Lord’s person\], have been proved falsehoods.
These <span id="fr_3629"></span>[3630](#fn_3629) men do, in fact, set
the Spirit aside altogether; they understand that Christ was one and
Jesus another; and they teach that there was not one Christ, but many.
And if they speak of them as united, they do again separate them: for
they show that one did indeed undergo sufferings, but that the other
remained impassible; that the one truly did ascend to the Pleroma, but
the other remained in the intermediate place; that the one does truly
feast and revel in places invisible and above all name, but that the
other is seated with the Demiurge, emptying him of power. It will
therefore be incumbent upon thee, and all others who give their
attention to this writing, and are anxious about their own salvation,
not readily to express acquiescence when they hear abroad the speeches
of these men: for, speaking things resembling the \[doctrine of the\]
faithful, as I have already observed, not only do they hold opinions
which are different, but absolutely contrary, and in all points full of
blasphemies, by which they destroy those persons who, by reason of the
resemblance of the words, imbibe a poison which disagrees with their
constitution, just as if one, giving lime mixed with water for milk,
should mislead by the similitude of the colour; as a man <span
id="fr_3630"></span>[3631](#fn_3630) superior to me has said, concerning
all that in any way corrupt the things of God and adulterate the truth,
“Lime is wickedly mixed with the milk of God.”
