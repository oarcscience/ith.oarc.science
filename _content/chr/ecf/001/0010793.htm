<p> <a name="ix.v"></A>  <h2 align="center"><a name="ix.v-p0.1"></A>Elucidation</h2>  
<p><a name="ix.v-p1"></A><a name="ix.v-p1.1"></A>The editor of this American Series confines himself in general to such occasional and <i>very</i> brief annotations as may suggest to students and others the practical views which are requisite to a clear comprehension of authors who wrote for past ages; for a sort and condition of men no longer existing, whose extinction as a class is, indeed, largely due to these writings. But he reserved to himself the privilege of correcting palpable mistakes, especially in points which bear upon questions of our own times.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.v-p2"></A>That our learned translators have unaccountably admitted a very inaccurate translation of the crucial paragraph in book iii. cap. iii. sect. 2, I have shown in the footnote at that place. It is evident, (1) because they themselves are not satisfied with it, and (2) because I have set it side by side with the more literal rendering of a writer who would have preferred their reading if it could have borne the test of criticism.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.v-p3"></A>Now, the authors of the Latin translation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3793"></A><A HREF="#fn_3793"><FONT SIZE="1">3794</FONT></A>
 may have designed the ambiguity which gives the Ultramontane party an apparent advantage; but it is an advantage which disappears as soon as it is examined, and hence I am content to take it as it stands. Various conjectures have been made as to the original Greek of Iren&aelig;us; but the Latin answers every purpose of the author&#146;s argument, and is fatal to the claims of the Papacy. Let me recur to the translation given, <i>in loco</i>, from a Roman Catholic, and this will be seen at once.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.v-p5"></A>For he thus renders it:&#8212;</p>  
<p><a name="ix.v-p6"></A>1. In this Church, &#8220;ever, <i>by those who are on every side</i>, has been preserved that tradition  <A NAME="page_461"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 461</FONT></A> <a name="ix.v-Page_461"></A>  which is from apostles.&#8221; How would such a proposition have sounded to Pius IX. in the Vatican Council? The faith is preserved <i>by those who come to Rome</i>, not by the Bishop who presides there.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.v-p7"></A>2. &#8220;For to this Church, on account of more potent principality,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3794"></A><A HREF="#fn_3794"><FONT SIZE="1">3795</FONT></A>
 it is necessary that <i>every Church</i> (that is, those who are, on every side, faithful) resort.&#8221; The greatness of Rome, that is, as the capital of the Empire, imparts to the local Church a superior dignity, even as compared with Lyons, or any other metropolitical Church. Everybody visits Rome: hence you find there faithful witnesses from every side (from all the Churches); and <i>their united testimony</i> it is which preserves in Rome the pure apostolic traditions.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.v-p9"></A>The Latin, thus translated by a candid Roman Catholic, reverses the whole system of the Papacy. Pius IX. informed his Bishops, at the late Council, that they were not called to bear their testimony, but to hear his infallible decree; &#8220;reducing us,&#8221; said the Archbishop of Paris, &#8220;to a council of sacristans.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="ix.v-p10"></A>Sustaining these views by a few footnotes, I add (1) a literal rendering of my own, and then (2) a metaphrase of the same, bringing out the argument from the crabbed obstructions of the Latin text. This, then, is what Iren&aelig;us says: (a) &#8220;For it is necessary for every Church (that is to say, the faithful from all parts) to meet in this Church, on account of the superior magistracy; in which Church, by those who are from all places, the tradition of the apostles has been preserved.&#8221; Or, more freely rendered: (b) &#8220;On account of the chief magistracy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3795"></A><A HREF="#fn_3795"><FONT SIZE="1">3796</FONT></A>
 [of the empire], the faithful from all parts, representing every Church, are obliged to resort to Rome, and there to come together; so that [it is the distinction of this Church that], in it, the tradition of the apostles has been preserved by Christians gathered together out of all the Churches.&#8221; Taking the entire argument of our author with the context, then, it amounts to this: &#8220;We must ask, not for local, but universal, testimony. Now, in every Church founded by the apostles has been handed down their traditions; but, as it would be a tedious thing to collect them all, let this suffice. Take that Church (nearest at hand, and which is the only Apostolic Church of the West), the great and glorious Church at Rome, which was there founded by the two apostles Peter and Paul. In her have been preserved the traditions <i>of all the Churches</i>, because everybody is forced to go to the seat of empire: and therefore, by these representatives of the whole Catholic Church, the apostolic traditions have been all collected in Rome:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3796"></A><A HREF="#fn_3796"><FONT SIZE="1">3797</FONT></A>
 and you have a synoptical view of all Churches in what is there preserved.&#8221; Had the views of the modern Papacy ever entered the head of Iren&aelig;us, what an absurdity would be this whole argument. He would have said, &#8220;It is no matter what may be gathered elsewhere; for the Bishop of Rome is the infallible oracle of all Catholic truth, and you will always find it by his mouth.&#8221; It should be noted that Orthodoxy was indeed preserved there, just so long as Rome permitted other Churches to contribute their testimony on the principle of Iren&aelig;us, and thus to make her the depository of all Catholic tradition, as witnessed &#8220;by <i>all, everywhere</i>, and from the beginning.&#8221; But all this is turned upside down by modern Romanism. No other Church is to be heard or considered; but Rome takes all into her own power, and may dictate to all Churches what they are to believe, however novel, or contrary to the torrent of antiquity in the teachings of their own founders and great doctors in all past time.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.v-p4"></A> One of the Antiochian Canons probably reflects the current language of an earlier antiquity thus: <span class="Greek"><a name="ix.v-p4.1"></A>&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8135; &#956;&#951;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#960;&#8057;&#955;&#949;&#953; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#967;&#8057;&#952;&#949;&#957; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#961;&#8051;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#8049;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962;</span>: and, if so, this <span class="Greek"><a name="ix.v-p4.2"></A>&#963;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#961;&#8051;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span> gives the meaning of <i>convenire</i>.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.v-p8"></A> &#8220;<i>Its</i> more potent,&#8221; etc., is not a strict rendering: &#8220;<i>the</i> more potent,&#8221; rather; which leaves the <i>principalitas</i> to the city, not the Church.</p> 
<A NAME="fn_3795"></A><A HREF="0010793.htm#fr_3795">461:3796</A> <a name="ix.v-p10.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.v-p11"></A> Bishop Wordsworth inclines to the idea that the original Greek was <span class="Greek"><a name="ix.v-p11.1"></A>&#7985;&#954;&#945;&#957;&#969;&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#953;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#945;</span>, thus conceding that Iren&aelig;us was speaking of the <i>greater antiquity</i> of Rome as compared with other (Western) Churches. Even so, he shows that the argument of Iren&aelig;us is fatal to Roman pretensions, which admit of no such ideas as he advances, and no such freedom as that of his dealings with Rome.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.v-p12"></A> Nobody has more forcibly stated the argument of Iren&aelig;us than the Abb&eacute; Guett&eacute;e, in his exhaustive work on the Papacy. I published a translation of this valuable historical epitome in New York (Carleton), 1867; but it is out of print. The original may be had in Paris (Fischbacher), No. 33 Rue de Seine.</p>
