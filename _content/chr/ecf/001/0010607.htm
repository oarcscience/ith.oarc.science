<p><a name="viii.v.iii-p1"></A><a name="viii.v.iii-p1.1"></A><a name="viii.v.iii-p1.2"></A>For Hercules, celebrated by his three nights,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2499"></A><A HREF="#fn_2499"><FONT SIZE="1">2500</FONT></A>
 sung by the poets for his successful labours, the son of Jupiter, who slew the lion and destroyed the many-headed hydra; who put to death the fierce and mighty boar, and was able to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from Hades the three-headed dog; who effectually cleansed the huge Augean building from its dung, and killed the bulls and the stag whose nostrils breathed fire, and plucked the golden fruit from the tree, and slew the poisonous serpent (and for some reason, which it is not lawful to utter, killed Achelous, and the guest-slaying Busiris), and crossed the mountains that he might get water which gave forth an articulate speech, as the story goes: he who was able to do so many and such like and so great deeds as these, how childishly he was delighted to be stunned by the cymbals of the satyrs, and to be conquered by the love of woman, and to be struck on the hips by the laughing Lyda! And at last, not being able to put off the tunic of Nessus, himself kindling his own funeral pile, so he died. Let Vulcan lay aside his envy, and not be jealous if he is hated because he is old and club-footed, and Mars loved, because young and beautiful. Since, therefore, ye Greeks, your gods are convicted of intemperance, and your heroes are effeminate, as the histories on which your dramas are founded have declared, such as the curse of Atreus, the bed of Thyestes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2500"></A><A HREF="#fn_2500"><FONT SIZE="1">2501</FONT></A>
 and the taint in the house of Pelops, and Danaus murdering through hatred and making &AElig;gyptus childless in the intoxication of his rage, and the Thyestean banquet spread by the Furies.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2501"></A><A HREF="#fn_2501"><FONT SIZE="1">2502</FONT></A>
 And Procne is to this day flitting about, lamenting; and her sister of Athens shrills with her tongue cut out. For what need is there of speaking of the goad&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2502"></A><A HREF="#fn_2502"><FONT SIZE="1">2503</FONT></A>
 of &#338;dipus, and the murder of Laius, and the marrying his mother, and the mutual slaughter of those who were at once his brothers and his sons?</p>
