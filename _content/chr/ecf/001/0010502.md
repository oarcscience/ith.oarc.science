### <span id="viii.iv.xli-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLI.—The oblation of fine flour was a figure of the Eucharist.

<span id="viii.iv.xli-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xli-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xli-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xli-p1.3"></span><span id="viii.iv.xli-p1.4"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xli-p1.5"></span>“And the offering of fine flour, sirs,” I
said, “which was prescribed to be presented on behalf of those purified
from leprosy, was a type of the bread of the Eucharist, the celebration
of which our Lord Jesus Christ prescribed, in remembrance of the
suffering which He endured on behalf of those who are purified in soul
from all iniquity, in order that we may at the same time thank God for
having created the world, with all things therein, for the sake of man,
and for delivering us from the evil in which we were, and for utterly
overthrowing <span id="fr_2057"></span>[2058](#fn_2057) principalities
and powers by Him who suffered according to His will. Hence God speaks
by the mouth of Malachi, one of the twelve \[prophets\], as I said
before, <span id="fr_2058"></span>[2059](#fn_2058) about the sacrifices
at that time presented by you: ‘I have no pleasure in you, saith the
Lord; and I will not accept your sacrifices at your hands: for, from the
rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, My name has been
glorified among the Gentiles, and in every place incense is offered to
My name, and a pure offering: for My name is great among the Gentiles,
saith the Lord: but ye profane it.’ <span
id="fr_2059"></span>[2060](#fn_2059) \[So\] He then speaks of those
Gentiles, namely us, who in every place offer sacrifices to Him, i.e.,
the bread of the Eucharist, and also the cup of the Eucharist, affirming
both that we glorify His name, and that you profane \[it\]. The command
of circumcision, again, bidding \[them\] always circumcise the children
on the eighth day, was a type of the true circumcision, by which we are
circumcised from deceit and iniquity through Him who rose from the dead
on the first day after the Sabbath, \[namely through\] our Lord Jesus
Christ. For the first day after the Sabbath, remaining the first <span
id="fr_2060"></span>[2061](#fn_2060) of all the days, is called,
however, the eighth, according to the number of all the days of the
cycle, and \[yet\] remains the first.
