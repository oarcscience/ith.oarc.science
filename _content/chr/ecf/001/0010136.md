### <span id="v.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Exhortation to meet together frequently for the worship of God.

<span id="v.ii.xiii-p1"></span><span id="v.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Take
heed, then, often to come together to give thanks to God, and show forth
His praise. <span id="v.ii.xiii-p1.2"></span><span
id="v.ii.xiii-p1.3"></span>For when ye assemble frequently in the same
place, the powers of Satan are destroyed, and the destruction at which
he aims <span id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575) is prevented by the
unity of your faith. Nothing is more precious than peace, by which all
war, both in heaven and earth, <span id="fr_576"></span>[577](#fn_576)
is brought to an end.

<span id="v.ii.xiii-p4"></span>Take heed, then, often to come together
to give thanks to God, and show forth His praise. <span
id="v.ii.xiii-p4.1"></span>For when ye come frequently together in the
same place, the powers of Satan are destroyed, and his “fiery
darts” <span id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577) urging to sin fall back
ineffectual. <span id="v.ii.xiii-p5.2"></span>For your concord and
harmonious faith prove his destruction, and the torment of his
assistants. Nothing is better than that peace which is according to
Christ, by which all war, both of aërial and terrestrial spirits, is
brought to an end. “For we wrestle not against blood and flesh, but
against principalities and powers, and against the rulers of the
darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly
places.” <span id="fr_578"></span>[579](#fn_578)
