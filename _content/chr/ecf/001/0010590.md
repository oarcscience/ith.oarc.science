### <span id="viii.iv.cxxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXIX.—That is confirmed from other passages of Scripture.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxix-p1"></span>“And now I shall again recite the
words which I have spoken in proof of this point. When Scripture says,
‘The Lord rained fire from the Lord out of heaven,’ the prophetic word
indicates that there were two in number: One upon the earth, who, it
says, descended to behold the cry of Sodom; Another in heaven, who also
is Lord of the Lord on earth, as He is Father and God; the cause of His
power and of His being Lord and God. Again, when the Scripture records
that God said in the beginning, ‘Behold, Adam has become like one of
Us,’ <span id="fr_2455"></span>[2456](#fn_2455) this phrase, ‘like one
of Us,’ is also indicative of number; and the words do not admit of a
figurative meaning, as the sophists endeavour to affix on them, who are
able neither to tell nor to understand the truth. And it is written in
the book of Wisdom: ‘If I should tell you daily events, I would be
mindful to enumerate them from the beginning. The Lord created me the
beginning of His ways for His works. From everlasting He established me
in the beginning, before He formed the earth, and before He made the
depths, and before the springs of waters came forth, before the
mountains were settled; He begets me before all the hills.’ ” <span
id="fr_2456"></span>[2457](#fn_2456) When I repeated these words, I
added: “You perceive, my hearers, if you bestow attention, that the
Scripture has declared that this Offspring was begotten by the Father
before all things created; and that which is begotten is numerically
distinct from that which begets, any one will admit.”
