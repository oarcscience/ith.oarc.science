### <span id="viii.viii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—Objections to the resurrection of the flesh.

<span id="viii.viii.ii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.viii.ii-p1.1"></span>They who maintain the wrong opinion say
that there is no resurrection of the flesh; giving as their reason that
it is impossible that what is corrupted and dissolved should be restored
to the same as it had been. And besides the impossibility, they say that
the salvation of the flesh is disadvantageous; and they abuse the flesh,
adducing its infirmities, and declare that it only is the cause of our
sins, so that if the flesh, say they, rise again, our infirmities also
rise with it. And such sophistical reasons as the following they
elaborate: If the flesh rise again, it must rise either entire and
possessed of all its parts, or imperfect. But its rising imperfect
argues a want of power on God’s part, if some parts could be saved, and
others not; but if all the parts are saved, then the body will
manifestly have all its members. But is it not absurd to say that these
members will exist after the resurrection from the dead, since the
Saviour said, “They neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but shall
be as the angels in heaven?” <span id="fr_2613"></span>[2614](#fn_2613)
And the angels, say they, have neither flesh, nor do they eat, nor have
sexual intercourse; therefore there shall be no resurrection of the
flesh. By <span id="page_295">p. 295</span> <span
id="viii.viii.ii-Page_295"></span> these and such like arguments, they
attempt to distract men from the faith. And there are some who maintain
that even Jesus Himself appeared only as spiritual, and not in flesh,
but presented merely the appearance of flesh: these persons seek to rob
the flesh of the promise. First, then, let us solve those things which
seem to them to be insoluble; then we will introduce in an orderly
manner the demonstration concerning the flesh, proving that it partakes
of salvation.
