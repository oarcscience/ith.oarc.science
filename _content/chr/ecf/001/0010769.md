### <span id="ix.iv.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—The heretics follow neither Scripture nor tradition.

<span id="ix.iv.iii-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>When,
however, they are confuted from the Scriptures, they turn round and
accuse these same Scriptures, as if they were not correct, nor of
authority, and \[assert\] that they are ambiguous, and that the truth
cannot be extracted from them by those who are ignorant of tradition.
For \[they allege\] that the truth was not delivered by means of written
documents, but *vivâ voce:* wherefore also Paul declared, “But we speak
wisdom among those that are perfect, but not the wisdom of this
world.” <span id="fr_3310"></span>[3311](#fn_3310) And this wisdom each
one of them alleges to be the fiction of his own inventing, forsooth; so
that, according to their idea, the truth properly resides at one time in
Valentinus, at another in Marcion, at another in Cerinthus, then
afterwards in Basilides, or has even been indifferently in any other
opponent, <span id="fr_3311"></span>[3312](#fn_3311) who could speak
nothing pertaining to salvation. For every one of these men, being
altogether of a perverse disposition, depraving the system of truth, is
not ashamed to preach himself.

<span id="ix.iv.iii-p4"></span>2. But, again, when we refer them to that
tradition which originates from the apostles, \[and\] which is preserved
by means of the succession of presbyters in the Churches, they object to
tradition, saying that they themselves are wiser not merely than the
presbyters, but even than the apostles, because they have discovered the
unadulterated truth. For \[they maintain\] that the apostles
intermingled the things of the law with the words of the Saviour; and
that not the apostles alone, but even the Lord Himself, spoke as at one
time from the Demiurge, at another from the intermediate place, and yet
again from the Pleroma, but that they themselves, indubitably,
unsulliedly, and purely, have knowledge of the hidden mystery: this is,
indeed, to blaspheme their Creator after a most impudent manner! It
comes to this, therefore, that these men do now consent neither to
Scripture nor to tradition.

<span id="ix.iv.iii-p5"></span>3. Such are the adversaries with whom we
have to deal, my very dear friend, endeavouring like slippery serpents
to escape at all points. Where-fore they must be opposed at all points,
if per-chance, by cutting off their retreat, we may succeed in turning
them back to the truth. For, though it is not an easy thing for a soul
under the influence of error to repent, yet, on the other hand, it is
not altogether impossible to escape from error when the truth is brought
alongside it.
