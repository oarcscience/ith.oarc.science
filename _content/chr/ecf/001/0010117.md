### <span id="iv.iv.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Praise of the martyr Polycarp.

<span id="iv.iv.xix-p1"></span>This, then, is the account of the blessed
Polycarp, who, being the twelfth that was martyred in Smyrna (reckoning
those also of Philadelphia), yet occupies a place of his own <span
id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471) in the memory of all men, insomuch
that he is everywhere spoken of by the heathen themselves. He was not
merely an illustrious teacher, but also a pre-eminent martyr, whose
martyrdom all desire to imitate, as having been altogether consistent
with the Gospel of Christ. For, having through patience overcome the
unjust governor, and thus acquired the crown of immortality, he now,
with the apostles and all the righteous \[in heaven\], rejoicingly
glorifies God, even the Father, and blesses our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Saviour of our souls, the Governor of our bodies, and the Shepherd of
the Catholic Church throughout the world. <span
