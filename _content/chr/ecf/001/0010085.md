### <span id="iv.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Expressions of personal unworthiness.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p1"></span><span id="iv.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>These
things, brethren, I write to you concerning righteousness, not because I
take anything upon myself, but because ye have invited me to do so. For
neither I, nor any other such one, can come up to the wisdom <span
id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356) of the blessed and glorified Paul. He,
when among you, accurately and stedfastly taught the word of truth in
the presence of those who were then alive. And when absent from you, he
wrote you a letter, <span id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357) which, if
you carefully study, you will find to be the means of building you up in
that faith which has been given you, and which, being followed by hope,
and preceded by love towards God, and Christ, and our neighbour, “is the
mother of us all.” <span id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358) For if any
one be inwardly <span id="page_34">p. 34</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii-Page_34"></span> possessed of these graces, he hath
fulfilled the command of righteousness, since he that hath love is far
from all sin.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p3"></span> The form is *plural*, but one Epistle is
probably meant. \[So, even in English, “letters” may be classically used
for a single letter, as we say “by these presents.” But even we might
speak of St. Paul as having written his Epistles *to us*; so the
Epistles to Thessalonica and Corinth might more naturally still be
referred to here\].
