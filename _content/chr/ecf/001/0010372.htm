<p><a name="viii.i-p1"></A><a name="viii.i-p1.1"></A> [<span class="upper"><a name="viii.i-p1.2"></A>a.d.</span> 110&#8211;165.] <span class="upper"><a name="viii.i-p1.3"></A>Justin</span> was a Gentile, but born in Samaria, near Jacob&#146;s well. He must have been well educated: he had travelled extensively, and he seems to have been a person enjoying at least a competence. After trying all other systems, his elevated tastes and refined perceptions made him a disciple of Socrates and Plato. So he climbed towards Christ. As he himself narrates the story of his conversion, it need not be anticipated here. What Plato was feeling after, he found in Jesus of Nazareth. The conversion of such a man marks a new era in the gospel history. The sub-apostolic age begins with the first Christian author,&#8212;the founder of theological literature. It introduced to mankind, as the mother of true philosophy, the despised teaching of those Galileans to whom their Master had said, &#8220;Ye are the light of the world.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="viii.i-p2"></A>And this is the epoch which forced this great truth upon the attention of contemplative minds. It was more than a hundred years since the angels had sung &#8220;Good-will to men;&#8221; and that song had now been heard for successive generations, breaking forth from the lips of sufferers on the cross, among lions, and amid blazing faggots. Here was a nobler Stoicism that needed interpretation. Not only choice spirits, despising the herd and boasting of a loftier intellectual sphere, were its professors; but thousands of men, women, and children, withdrawing themselves not at all from the ordinary and humble lot of the people, were inspired by it to live and die heroically and sublimely, &#8212;exhibiting a superiority to revenge and hate entirely unaccountable, praying for their enemies, and seeking to glorify their God by love to their fellow-men.</p>  
<p><a name="viii.i-p3"></A>And in spite of Gallios and Neros alike, the gospel was dispelling the gross darkness. Of this, Pliny&#146;s letter to Trajan is decisive evidence. Even in Seneca we detect reflections of the daybreak. Plutarch writes as never a Gentile could have written until now. Plato is practically surpassed by him in his thoughts upon the &#8220;delays&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1764"></A><A HREF="#fn_1764"><FONT SIZE="1">1765</FONT></A>
 of the Divine Justice.&#8221; Hadrian&#146;s address to his soul, in his dying moments, is a tribute to the new ideas which had been sown in the popular mind. And now the Antonines, impelled by something in the age, came forward to reign as &#8220;philosophers.&#8221; At this moment, Justin Martyr confronts them like a Daniel. The &#8220;little stone&#8221; smites the imperial image in the face, not yet &#8220;in the toes.&#8221; He tells the professional philosophers on a throne how false and hollow is all wisdom that is not meant for all humanity, and that is not capable of leavening the masses. He exposes the impotency of even Socratic philosophy: he shows, in contrast, the force that works in the words of Jesus; he points out their regenerating power. It is the mission of Justin to be a star in the West, leading its Wise Men to the cradle of Bethlehem.</p>  
<p><a name="viii.i-p5"></A>  <A NAME="page_160"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 160</FONT></A> <a name="viii.i-Page_160"></A>  The writings of Justin are deficient in charms of style; and, for us, there is something the reverse of attractive in the forms of thought which he had learned from the philosophers.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1765"></A><A HREF="#fn_1765"><FONT SIZE="1">1766</FONT></A>
 If Plato had left us nothing but the Tim&aelig;us, a Renan would doubtless have reproached him as of feeble intellectual power. So a dancing-master might criticise the movements of an athlete, or the writhings of St. Sebastian shot with arrows. The practical wisdom of Justin using the rhetoric of his times, and discomfiting false philosophy with its own weapons, is not appreciated by the fastidious Parisian. But the manly and heroic pleadings of the man, for a despised people with whom he had boldly identified himself; the intrepidity with which he defends them before despots, whose mere caprice might punish him with death; above all, the undaunted spirit with which he exposes the shame and absurdity of their inveterate superstition and reproaches the memory of Hadrian whom Antoninus had deified, as he had deified Antinous of loathsome history,&#8212;these are characteristics which every instinct of the unvitiated soul delights to honour. Justin cannot be refuted by a sneer.</p>  
<p><a name="viii.i-p7"></A>He wore his philosopher&#146;s gown after his conversion, as a token that he had attained the only true philosophy. And seeing, that, after the conflicts and tests of ages, it is the only philosophy that lasts and lives and triumphs, its discoverer deserves the homage of mankind. Of the philosophic gown we shall hear again when we come to Tertullian.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1766"></A><A HREF="#fn_1766"><FONT SIZE="1">1767</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="viii.i-p9"></A>The residue of Justin&#146;s history may be found in The Martyrdom and other pages soon to follow, as well as in the following <span class="upper"><a name="viii.i-p9.1"></A>Introductory Note</span> of the able translators, Messrs. Dods and Reith:&#8212;</p>  
<p><a name="viii.i-p10"></A><span class="upper"><a name="viii.i-p10.1"></A>Justin Martyr</span> was born in Flavia Neapolis, a city of Samaria, the modern Nablous. The date of his birth is uncertain, but may be fixed about <span class="upper"><a name="viii.i-p10.2"></A>a.d.</span> 114. His father and grandfather were probably of Roman origin. Before his conversion to Christianity he studied in the schools of the philosophers, searching after some knowledge which should satisfy the cravings of his soul. At last he became acquainted with Christianity, being at once impressed with the extraordinary fearlessness which the Christians displayed in the presence of death, and with the grandeur, stability, and truth of the teachings of the Old Testament. From this time he acted as an evangelist, taking every opportunity to proclaim the gospel as the only safe and certain philosophy, the only way to salvation. It is probable that he travelled much. We know that he was some time in Ephesus, and he must have lived for a considerable period in Rome. Probably he settled in Rome as a Christian teacher. While he was there, the philosophers, especially the Cynics, plotted against him, and he sealed his testimony to the truth by martyrdom.</p>  
<p><a name="viii.i-p11"></A>The principal facts of Justin&#146;s life are gathered from his own writings. There is little clue to dates. It is agreed on all hands that he lived in the reign of Antoninus Pius, and the testimony of Eusebius and most credible historians renders it nearly certain that he suffered martyrdom in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. The <i>Chronicon Paschale</i> gives as the date 165 <span class="upper"><a name="viii.i-p11.1"></A>a.d.</span></p>  
<p><a name="viii.i-p12"></A>The writings of Justin Martyr are among the most important that have come down to us from the second century. He was not the first that wrote an Apology in behalf of the Christians, but his Apologies are the earliest extant. They are characterized by intense Christian fervour, and they give us an insight into the relations existing between heathens and Christians in those days. His other principal writing, the Dialogue with Trypho, is the first elaborate exposition of the reasons for regarding Christ as the Messiah of the Old Testament, and the first systematic attempt to exhibit the false position of the Jews in regard to Christianity.</p>  
<p><a name="viii.i-p13"></A>Many of Justin&#146;s writings have perished. Those works which have come to us bearing his name have been divided into three classes.</p>  
<p><a name="viii.i-p14"></A>  <A NAME="page_161"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 161</FONT></A> <a name="viii.i-Page_161"></A>  The first class embraces those which are unquestionably genuine, viz. the two Apologies, and the Dialogue with Trypho. Some critics have urged objections against Justin&#146;s authorship of the Dialogue; but the objections are regarded now as possessing no weight.</p>  
<p><a name="viii.i-p15"></A>The second class consists of those works which are regarded by some critics as Justin&#146;s, and by others as not his. They are: 1. An Address to the Greeks; 2. A Hortatory Address to the Greeks; 3. On the Sole Government of God; 4. An Epistle to Diognetus; 5. Fragments from a work on the Resurrection; 6. And other Fragments. Whatever difficulty there may be in settling the authorship of these treatises, there is but one opinion as to their earliness. The latest of them, in all probability, was not written later than the third century.</p>  
<p><a name="viii.i-p16"></A>The third class consists of those that are unquestionably not the works of Justin. These are: 1. An Exposition of the True Faith; 2. Replies to the Orthodox; 3. Christian Questions to Gentiles; 4. Gentile Questions to Christians; 5. Epistle to Zenas and Serenus; and 6. A Refutation of certain Doctrines of Aristotle. There is no clue to the date of the two last. There can be no doubt that the others were written after the Council of Nic&aelig;a, though, immediately after the Reformation, Calvin and others appealed to the first as a genuine writing of Justin&#146;s.</p>  
<p><a name="viii.i-p17"></A>There is a curious question connected with the Apologies of Justin which have come down to us. Eusebius mentions two Apologies,&#8212;one written in the reign of Antoninus Pius, the other in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Critics have disputed much whether we have these two Apologies in those now extant. Some have maintained, that what is now called the Second Apology was the preface of the first, and that the second is lost. Others have tried to show, that the so-called Second Apology is the continuation of the first, and that the second is lost. Others have supposed that the two Apologies which we have are Justin&#146;s two Apologies, but that Eusebius was wrong in affirming that the second was addressed to Marcus Aurelius; and others maintain, that we have in our two Apologies the two Apologies mentioned by Eusebius, and that our first is his first, and our second his second.</p>
