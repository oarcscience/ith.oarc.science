### <span id="v.iii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Reason of writing the epistle.

<span id="v.iii.i-p1"></span><span id="v.iii.i-p1.1"></span><span
class="upper"><span id="v.iii.i-p1.2"></span>Having</span> been informed
of your godly <span id="fr_631"></span>[632](#fn_631) love, so
well-ordered, I rejoiced greatly, and determined to commune with you in
the faith of Jesus Christ. <span id="v.iii.i-p2.1"></span>For as one who
has been thought worthy of the most honourable of all names, <span
id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632) in those bonds which I bear about, I
commend the Churches, in which I pray for a union both of the flesh and
spirit of Jesus Christ, the constant source of our life, and of faith
and love, to which nothing is to be preferred, but especially of Jesus
and the Father, in whom, if we endure all the assaults of the prince of
this world, and escape them, we shall enjoy God.

<span id="v.iii.i-p4"></span><span id="v.iii.i-p4.1"></span><span
class="upper"><span id="v.iii.i-p4.2"></span>Having</span> been informed
of your godly <span id="fr_633"></span>[634](#fn_633) love, so
well-ordered, I rejoiced greatly, and determined to commune with you in
the faith of Jesus Christ. <span id="v.iii.i-p5.1"></span>For as one who
has been thought worthy of a divine and desirable name, in those bonds
which I bear about, I commend the Churches, in which I pray for a union
both of the flesh and spirit of Jesus Christ, “who is the Saviour of all
men, but specially of them that believe;” <span
id="fr_634"></span>[635](#fn_634) by whose blood ye were redeemed; by
whom ye have known God, or rather have been known by Him; <span
id="fr_635"></span>[636](#fn_635) in whom enduring, ye shall escape all
the assaults of this world: for “He is faithful, who will not suffer you
to be tempted above that which ye are able.” <span
id="fr_636"></span>[637](#fn_636)
