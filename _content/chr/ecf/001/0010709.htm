<p> <a name="ix.ii.xiii"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="ix.ii.xiii-p0.1"></A>Chapter XII.&#8212;The doctrines of the followers of Ptolemy and Colorbasus.</h3>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xiii-p1"></A>1. <a name="ix.ii.xiii-p1.1"></A><a name="ix.ii.xiii-p1.2"></A>But the followers of Ptolemy say&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2804"></A><A HREF="#fn_2804"><FONT SIZE="1">2805</FONT></A>
 that he <a name="ix.ii.xiii-p2.1"></A>[Bythus] has two consorts, which they also name <a name="ix.ii.xiii-p2.2"></A><i>Diatheses</i> (affections), viz., Enn&#339;a and <a name="ix.ii.xiii-p2.3"></A>Thelesis. For, as they affirm, he first conceived the thought of producing something, and then willed to that effect. Wherefore, again, these two affections, or powers, <a name="ix.ii.xiii-p2.4"></A>Enn&#339;a and Thelesis, having intercourse, as it were, between themselves, the production of Monogenes and <a name="ix.ii.xiii-p2.5"></A>Aletheia took place according to conjunction. These two came forth as types and images of the two affections of the Father,&#8212;visible representations of those that were invisible,&#8212;<a name="ix.ii.xiii-p2.6"></A>Nous (i.e., <a name="ix.ii.xiii-p2.7"></A>Monogenes) of Thelesis, and Aletheia of Enn&#339;a, and accordingly the image resulting from Thelesis was masculine,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2805"></A><A HREF="#fn_2805"><FONT SIZE="1">2806</FONT></A>
 while that from Enn&#339;a was feminine. Thus Thelesis (will) became, as it were, a faculty of Enn&#339;a (thought). For Enn&#339;a continually yearned after offspring; but she could not of herself bring forth that which she desired. But when the power of Thelesis (the faculty of will) came upon her, then she brought forth that on which she had brooded.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xiii-p4"></A>2. <a name="ix.ii.xiii-p4.1"></A>These fancied beings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2806"></A><A HREF="#fn_2806"><FONT SIZE="1">2807</FONT></A>
 (like the Jove of Homer, who is represented&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2807"></A><A HREF="#fn_2807"><FONT SIZE="1">2808</FONT></A>
 as passing an anxious sleepless night in devising plans for honouring Achilles and destroying numbers of the Greeks) will not appear to you, my dear friend, to be possessed of greater knowledge than He who is the God of the universe. He, as soon as He thinks, also performs what He has willed; and as soon as He wills, also thinks that which He has willed; then thinking when He wills, and then willing when He thinks, since He is all thought, [all will, all mind, all light,]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2808"></A><A HREF="#fn_2808"><FONT SIZE="1">2809</FONT></A>
 all eye, all ear, the one entire fountain of all good things.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xiii-p8"></A>3. <a name="ix.ii.xiii-p8.1"></A>Those of them, however, who are deemed more skilful than the persons who have just been mentioned, say that the first Ogdoad was not produced gradually, so that one &AElig;on was sent forth by another, but that all&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2809"></A><A HREF="#fn_2809"><FONT SIZE="1">2810</FONT></A>
 the &AElig;ons were brought into existence at once by <a name="ix.ii.xiii-p9.1"></A>Propator and his Enn&#339;a. He (Colorbasus) affirms this as confidently as if he had assisted at their birth. <a name="ix.ii.xiii-p9.2"></A>Accordingly, he and his followers maintain that Anthropos and Ecclesia were not produced,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2810"></A><A HREF="#fn_2810"><FONT SIZE="1">2811</FONT></A>
 as others hold, from Logos and Zoe; but, on the contrary, Logos and Zoe from Anthropos and Ecclesia. But they express this in another form, as follows: When the Propator conceived the thought of producing something, he received the name of <i>Father</i>. But because what he did produce was <i>true</i>, it was named Aletheia. Again, when he wished to reveal himself, this was termed Anthropos. <a name="ix.ii.xiii-p10.1"></A>Finally, when he produced those whom he had previously thought of, these were named Ecclesia. Anthropos, by speaking, formed Logos: this is the first-born son. But Zoe followed upon Logos; and thus the first Ogdoad was completed.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xiii-p11"></A>4. <a name="ix.ii.xiii-p11.1"></A><a name="ix.ii.xiii-p11.2"></A>They have much contention also among themselves respecting the Saviour. For some  <A NAME="page_334"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 334</FONT></A> <a name="ix.ii.xiii-Page_334"></A>  maintain that he was formed out of all; wherefore also he was called Eudocetos, because the whole Pleroma was <i>well pleased</i> through him to glorify the Father. But others assert that he was produced from those ten &AElig;ons alone who sprung from Logos and Zoe, and that on this account he was called Logos and Zoe, thus preserving the ancestral names.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2811"></A><A HREF="#fn_2811"><FONT SIZE="1">2812</FONT></A>
 Others, again, affirm that he had his being from those twelve &AElig;ons who were the offspring of Anthropos and Ecclesia; and on this account he acknowledges himself the Son of man, as being a descendant of Anthropos. Others still, assert that he was produced by Christ and the Holy Spirit, who were brought forth for the security of the Pleroma; and that on this account he was called Christ, thus preserving the appellation of the Father, by whom he was produced. And there are yet others among them who declare that the Propator of the whole, Proarche, and Proanennoetos is called Anthropos; and that this is the great and abstruse mystery, namely, that the Power which is above all others, and contains all in his embrace, is termed Anthropos; hence does the Saviour style himself the &#8220;Son of man.&#8221;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.ii.xiii-p2"></A> We here follow the Greek as preserved by Hippolytus (<i>Philosoph.</i>, vi. 38). The text followed by Epiphanius (<i>H&aelig;r.</i>, xxxiii. 1) does not so well agree with the Latin.</p> 
<A NAME="fn_2805"></A><A HREF="0010709.htm#fr_2805">333:2806</A> <a name="ix.ii.xiii-p2.8"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.ii.xiii-p3"></A> The text is here hopelessly corrupt; but the general meaning seems to be that given above.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.ii.xiii-p5"></A> This sentence exists only in the Latin version, and we can give only a free translation.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.ii.xiii-p7"></A> These words are found in <i>Epiphanius</i>, but omitted in the old Latin version. The Latin gives &#8220;sense&#8221; instead of &#8220;light.&#8221;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.ii.xiii-p9"></A> The text is here very uncertain. Some propose to read <i>six</i> &AElig;ons instead of <i>all</i>.</p> 
<A NAME="fn_2810"></A><A HREF="0010709.htm#fr_2810">333:2811</A> <a name="ix.ii.xiii-p9.3"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.ii.xiii-p10"></A> Here again the text is corrupt and obscure. We have followed what seems the most probable emendation.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.ii.xiii-p12"></A> Harvey justly remarks, that &#8220;one cause of perplexity in unravelling the Valentinian scheme is the recurrence of similar names at different points of the system, e.g., the Enthymesis of Sophia was called Sophia and Spiritus; and Pater, Arche, Monogenes, Christus, Anthropos, Ecclesia, were all of them terms of a double denomination.&#8221;</p>
