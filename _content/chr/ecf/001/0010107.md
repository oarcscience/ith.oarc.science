### <span id="iv.iv.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Polycarp refuses to revile Christ.

<span id="iv.iv.ix-p1"></span><span id="iv.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Now, as
Polycarp was entering into the stadium, there came to him a voice from
heaven, saying, “Be strong, and show thyself a man, O Polycarp!” No one
saw who it was that spoke to him; but those of our brethren who were
present heard the voice. And as he was brought forward, the tumult
became great when they heard that Polycarp was taken. And when he came
near, the proconsul asked him whether he was Polycarp. On his confessing
that he was, \[the proconsul\] sought to persuade him to deny
\[Christ\], saying, “Have respect to thy old age,” and other similar
things, according to their custom, \[such as\], “Swear by the fortune of
Cæsar; repent, and say, Away with the Atheists.” But Polycarp, gazing
with a stern countenance on all the multitude of the wicked heathen then
in the stadium, and waving his hand towards them, while with groans he
looked up to heaven, said, “Away with the Atheists.” <span

saying, “Swear, and I will set thee at liberty, reproach Christ;”
Polycarp declared, “Eighty and six years have I served Him, and He never
did me any injury: how then can I blaspheme my King and my Saviour?”
