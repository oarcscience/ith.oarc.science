### <span id="iv.iv.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—The departure and vision of Polycarp.

<span id="iv.iv.v-p1"></span>But the most admirable Polycarp, when he
first heard \[that he was sought for\], was in no measure disturbed, but
resolved to continue in the city. However, in deference to the wish of
many, he was persuaded to leave it. He departed, therefore, to a country
house not far distant from the city. There he stayed with a few
\[friends\], engaged in nothing else night and day than praying for all
men, and for the Churches throughout the world, according to his usual
custom. <span id="iv.iv.v-p1.1"></span>And while he was praying, a
vision presented itself to him three days before he was taken; and,
behold, the pillow under his head seemed to him on fire. Upon this,
turning to those that were with him, he said to them prophetically, “I
must be burnt alive.”
