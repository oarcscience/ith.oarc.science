But if you are willing to listen to an account of Him, how we have not been deceived, and shall not cease to confess Him,&#8212;although men&#146;s reproaches be heaped upon us, although the most terrible tyrant compel us to deny Him,&#8212;I shall prove to you as you stand here that we have not believed empty fables, or words without any foundation but words filled with the Spirit of God, and big with power, and flourishing with grace.&#8221;</p>

Two of his friends, when they had ridiculed and made game of our zeal, went off. And when we were come to that place, where there are stone seats on both sides, those with Trypho, having seated themselves on the one side, conversed with each other, some one of them having thrown in a remark about the war waged in Jud&aelig;a.</p>
