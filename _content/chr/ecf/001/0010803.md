### <span id="ix.vi.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Vain attempts of Marcion and his followers, who exclude Abraham from the salvation bestowed by Christ, who liberated not only Abraham, but the seed of Abraham, by fulfilling and not destroying the law when He healed on the Sabbath-day.

<span id="ix.vi.ix-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.ix-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.vi.ix-p1.2"></span>Vain, too, is \[the effort of\] Marcion and
his followers when they \[seek to\] exclude Abraham from the
inheritance, to whom the Spirit through many men, and now by Paul, bears
witness, that “he believed God, and it was imputed unto him for
righteousness.” <span id="fr_3880"></span>[3881](#fn_3880) And the Lord
\[also bears witness to him,\] in the first place, indeed, by raising up
children to him from the stones, and making his seed as the stars of
heaven, saying, “They shall come from the east and from the west, from
the north and from the south, and shall recline with Abraham, and Isaac,
and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;” <span
id="fr_3881"></span>[3882](#fn_3881) and then again by saying to the
Jews, “When ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the
prophets in the kingdom of heaven, but you <span id="page_471">p.
471</span> <span id="ix.vi.ix-Page_471"></span> yourselves cast
out.” <span id="fr_3882"></span>[3883](#fn_3882) This, then, is a clear
point, that those who disallow his salvation, and frame the idea of
another God besides Him who made the promise to Abraham, are outside the
kingdom of God, and are disinherited from \[the gift of\] incorruption,
setting at naught and blaspheming God, who introduces, through Jesus
Christ, Abraham to the kingdom of heaven, and his seed, that is, the
Church, upon which also is conferred the adoption and the inheritance
promised to Abraham.

<span id="ix.vi.ix-p5"></span>2. For the Lord vindicated Abraham’s
posterity by loosing them from bondage and calling them to salvation, as
He did in the case of the woman whom He healed, saying openly to those
who had not faith like Abraham, “Ye hypocrites, <span
id="fr_3883"></span>[3884](#fn_3883) doth not each one of you on the
Sabbath-days loose his ox or his ass, and lead him away to watering? And
ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound
these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the
Sabbath-days?” <span id="fr_3884"></span>[3885](#fn_3884) It is clear
therefore, that He loosed and vivified those who believe in Him as
Abraham did, doing nothing contrary to the law when He healed upon the
Sabbath-day. For the law did not prohibit men from being healed upon the
Sabbaths; \[on the contrary,\] it even circumcised them upon that day,
and gave command that the offices should be performed by the priests for
the people; yea, it did not disallow the healing even of dumb animals.
Both at Siloam and on frequent subsequent <span
id="fr_3885"></span>[3886](#fn_3885) occasions, did He perform cures
upon the Sabbath; and for this reason many used to resort to Him on the
Sabbath-days. For the law commanded them to abstain from every servile
work, that is, from all grasping after wealth which is procured by
trading and by other worldly business; but it exhorted them to attend to
the exercises of the soul, which consist in reflection, and to addresses
of a beneficial kind for their neighbours’ benefit. And therefore the
Lord reproved those who unjustly blamed Him for having healed upon the
Sabbath-days. For He did not make void, but fulfilled the law, by
performing the offices of the high priest, propitiating God for men, and
cleansing the lepers, healing the sick, and Himself suffering death,
that exiled man might go forth from condemnation, and might return
without fear to his own inheritance.

<span id="ix.vi.ix-p9"></span>3. <span id="ix.vi.ix-p9.1"></span>And
again, the law did not forbid those who were hungry on the Sabbath-days
to take food lying ready at hand: it did, however, forbid them to reap
and to gather into the barn. And therefore did the Lord say to those who
were blaming His disciples because they plucked and ate the ears of
corn, rubbing them in their hands, “Have ye not read this, what David
did, when himself was an hungered; how he went into the house of God,
and ate the shew-bread, and gave to those who were with him; which it is
not lawful to eat, but for the priests alone?” <span
id="fr_3886"></span>[3887](#fn_3886) justifying His disciples by the
words of the law, and pointing out that it was lawful for the priests to
act freely. For David had been appointed a priest by God, although Saul
persecuted him. For all the righteous possess the sacerdotal rank. <span
id="fr_3887"></span>[3888](#fn_3887) And all the apostles of the Lord
are priests, who do inherit here neither lands nor houses, but serve God
and the altar continually. Of whom Moses also says in Deuteronomy, when
blessing Levi, “Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not
known thee; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, and he disinherited
his own sons: he kept Thy commandments, and observed Thy
covenant.” <span id="fr_3888"></span>[3889](#fn_3888) But who are they
that have left father and mother, and have said adieu to all their
neighbours, on account of the word of God and His covenant, unless the
disciples of the Lord? Of whom again Moses says, “They shall have no
inheritance, for the Lord Himself is their inheritance.” <span
id="fr_3889"></span>[3890](#fn_3889) And again, “The priests the Levites
shall have no part in the whole tribe of Levi, nor substance with
Israel; their substance is the offerings (*fructifications*) of the
Lord: these shall they eat.” <span id="fr_3890"></span>[3891](#fn_3890)
Wherefore also Paul says, “I do not seek after a gift, but I seek after
fruit.” <span id="fr_3891"></span>[3892](#fn_3891) To His disciples He
said, who had a priesthood of the Lord, <span
id="fr_3892"></span>[3893](#fn_3892) to whom it was lawful when hungry
to eat the ears of corn, <span id="fr_3893"></span>[3894](#fn_3893) “For
the workman is worthy of his meat.” <span
id="fr_3894"></span>[3895](#fn_3894) And the priests in the temple
profaned the Sabbath, and were blameless. Wherefore, then, were they
blameless? Because when in the temple they were not engaged in secular
affairs, but in the service of the Lord, fulfilling the law, but not
going beyond it, as that man did, who of his own accord carried dry wood
into the camp of God, and was justly stoned to death. <span
id="fr_3895"></span>[3896](#fn_3895) “For every tree that bringeth not
forth good fruit shall be hewn down, and cast into the fire;” <span
id="fr_3896"></span>[3897](#fn_3896) and “whosoever shall defile the
temple of God, him shall God defile.” <span
id="fr_3897"></span>[3898](#fn_3897)
