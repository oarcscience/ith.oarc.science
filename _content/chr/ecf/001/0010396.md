### <span id="viii.ii.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—The argument.

<span id="viii.ii.xxiii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xxiii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.xxiii-p1.2"></span>And
that this may now become evident to you—(firstly <span
id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813) ) that whatever we assert in
conformity with what has been taught us by Christ, and by the prophets
who preceded Him, are alone true, and are older than all the writers who
have existed; that we claim to be acknowledged, not because we say the
same things as these writers said, but because we say true things: and
(secondly) that Jesus Christ is the only proper Son who has been
begotten by God, being His Word and first-begotten, and power; and,
becoming man according to His will, He <span id="page_171">p. 171</span>
<span id="viii.ii.xxiii-Page_171"></span> taught us these things for the
conversion and restoration of the human race: and (thirdly) that before
He became a man among men, some, influenced by the demons before
mentioned, related beforehand, through the instrumentality of the poets,
those circumstances as having really happened, which, having
fictitiously devised, they narrated, in the same manner as they have
caused to be fabricated the scandalous reports against us of infamous
and impious actions, <span id="fr_1814"></span>[1815](#fn_1814) of which
there is neither witness nor proof—we shall bring forward the following
proof.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1813"></span>[170:1814](0010396.htm#fr_1813) <span
id="viii.ii.xxiii-p1.3"></span>

<span id="viii.ii.xxiii-p2"></span> The Benedictine editor, Maranus,
Otto, and Trollope, here note that Justin in this chapter promises to
make good three distinct positions: 1st, That Christian doctrines alone
are true, and are to be received, not on account of their resemblance to
the sentiments of poets and philosophers, but on their own account; 2d,
that Jesus Christ is the incarnate Son of God, and our teacher; 3d that
before His incarnation, the demons, having some knowledge of what He
would accomplish, enabled the heathen poets and priest in some points to
anticipate, though in a distorted form, the facts of the incarnation.
The first he establishes in chap. xxiv-xxix.; the second in chap.
xxx.-liii.; and the third in chap. liv. et sq.

<span id="viii.ii.xxiii-p3"></span> We have here followed the reading
and rendering of Trollope. \[But see reading of Langus, and Grabe’s
note, in the edition already cited, 1. 46.\]
