<p> <a name="ix.iii.xxxiii"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="ix.iii.xxxiii-p0.1"></A>Chapter XXXII.&#8212;Further exposure of the wicked and blasphemous doctrines of the heretics.</h3>  
<p><a name="ix.iii.xxxiii-p1"></A>1. <a name="ix.iii.xxxiii-p1.1"></A><a name="ix.iii.xxxiii-p1.2"></A><a name="ix.iii.xxxiii-p1.3"></A>Moreover, this impious opinion of theirs with respect to actions&#8212;namely, that it is incumbent on them to have experience of all kinds of deeds, even the most abominable&#8212;is refuted by the teaching of the Lord, with whom not only is the adulterer rejected, but also the man who desires to commit adultery;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3265"></A><A HREF="#fn_3265"><FONT SIZE="1">3266</FONT></A>
 and not only is the actual murderer held guilty of having killed another to his own damnation, but the man also who is angry with his brother without a cause: who commanded [His disciples] not only not to hate men, but also to love their enemies; and enjoined them not only not to swear falsely, but not even to swear at all; and not only not to speak evil of their neighbours, but not even to style any one &#8220;Raca&#8221; and &#8220;fool;&#8221; [declaring] that otherwise they were in danger of hell-fire; and not only not to strike, but even, when themselves struck, to present the other cheek [to those that maltreated them]; and not only not to refuse to give up the property of others, but even if their own were taken away, not to demand it back again from those that took it; and not only not to injure their neighbours, nor to do them any evil, but also, when themselves wickedly dealt with, to be long-suffering, and to show kindness towards those [that injured them], and to pray for them, that by means of repentance they might be saved&#8212;so that we should in no respect imitate the arrogance, lust, and pride of others. Since, therefore, He whom these men boast of as their Master, and of whom they affirm that He had a soul greatly better and more highly toned than others, did indeed, with much earnestness, command certain things to be done as being good and excellent, and certain things to be abstained from not only in their actual perpetration, but even in the thoughts which lead to their performance, as being wicked, pernicious, and abominable, &#8212;how then can they escape being put to confusion, when they affirm that such a Master was more highly toned [in spirit] and better than others, and yet manifestly give instruction of a kind utterly opposed to His teaching? And, again, if there were really no such thing as good and evil, but certain things were deemed righteous, and certain others unrighteous, in human opinion only, He never would have expressed Himself thus in His teaching: &#8220;The righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3266"></A><A HREF="#fn_3266"><FONT SIZE="1">3267</FONT></A>
 but He shall send the unrighteous, and those who do not the works of righteousness, &#8220;into everlasting fire, where their worm shall not die, and the fire shall not be quenched.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3267"></A><A HREF="#fn_3267"><FONT SIZE="1">3268</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="ix.iii.xxxiii-p5"></A>2. When they further maintain that it is incumbent on them to have experience of every kind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3268"></A><A HREF="#fn_3268"><FONT SIZE="1">3269</FONT></A>
 of work and conduct, so that, if it be possible, accomplishing all during one manifestation in this life, they may [at once] pass over to the state of perfection, they are, by no chance, found striving to do those things which wait upon virtue, and are laborious, glorious, and skilful,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3269"></A><A HREF="#fn_3269"><FONT SIZE="1">3270</FONT></A>
 which also are approved universally as being good. For if it be necessary to go through every work and every kind of operation, they ought, in the first place, to learn all the arts: all of them, [I say,] whether referring to theory or practice, whether they be acquired by self-denial, or are mastered through means of labour, exercise, and perseverance; as, for example, every kind of music, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and all such as are occupied with intellectual pursuits: then, again, the whole study of medicine, and the knowledge of plants, so as to become acquainted with those which are prepared for the health of man; the art of painting and sculpture, brass and marble work, and the kindred arts: moreover, [they have to study] every kind of country labour, the veterinary art, pastoral occupations, the various kinds of skilled labour, which are said to pervade the whole circle of [human] exertion; those, again, connected with a maritime life, gymnastic exercises, hunting, military and kingly pursuits, and as many others as may exist, of which, with the utmost labour, they could not learn the tenth, or even the thousandth part, in the whole course of their lives. The fact indeed is, that they endeavour to learn none of these, although they maintain that it is incumbent on them to have experience of every kind of work; but, turning aside to voluptuousness, and lust, and abominable actions, they stand self-condemned when they are tried by their own doctrine. For, since they are destitute of all those [virtues] which have been mentioned, they will [of necessity] pass into the destruction of fire. These men, while they boast of Jesus as being their Master, do in fact emulate the philosophy of Epicurus and the indifference of the Cynics, [calling Jesus their Master,] who not only turned His disciples away from evil deeds, but even from [wicked] words and thoughts, as I have already shown.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.iii.xxxiii-p8"></A>3. Again, while they assert that they possess souls from the same sphere as Jesus, and that they are like to Him, sometimes even maintaining that they are superior; while [they affirm that they were] produced, like Him, for the  <A NAME="page_409"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 409</FONT></A> <a name="ix.iii.xxxiii-Page_409"></A>  performance of works tending to the benefit and establishment of mankind, they are found doing nothing of the same or a like kind [with His actions], nor what can in any respect be brought into comparison with them. And if they have in truth accomplished anything [remarkable] by means of magic, they strive [in this way] deceitfully to lead foolish people astray, since they confer no real benefit or blessing on those over whom they declare that they exert [supernatural] power; but, bringing forward mere boys&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3270"></A><A HREF="#fn_3270"><FONT SIZE="1">3271</FONT></A>
 [as the subjects on whom they practise], and deceiving their sight, while they exhibit phantasms that instantly cease, and do not endure even a moment of time,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3271"></A><A HREF="#fn_3271"><FONT SIZE="1">3272</FONT></A>
 they are proved to be like, not Jesus our Lord, but Simon the magician. It is certain,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3272"></A><A HREF="#fn_3272"><FONT SIZE="1">3273</FONT></A>
 too, from the fact that the Lord rose from the dead on the third day, and manifested Himself to His disciples, and was in their sight received up into heaven, that, inasmuch as these men die, and do not rise again, nor manifest themselves to any, they are proved as possessing souls in no respect similar to that of Jesus.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.iii.xxxiii-p12"></A>4. <a name="ix.iii.xxxiii-p12.1"></A>I<a name="ix.iii.xxxiii-p12.2"></A>f, however, they maintain that the Lord, too, performed such works simply in appearance, we shall refer them to the prophetical writings, and prove from these both that all things were thus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3273"></A><A HREF="#fn_3273"><FONT SIZE="1">3274</FONT></A>
 predicted regarding Him, and did take place undoubtedly, and that He is the only Son of God. Wherefore, also, those who are in truth His disciples, receiving grace from Him, do in His name perform [miracles], so as to promote the welfare of other men, according to the gift which each one has received from Him. For some do certainly and truly drive out devils, so that those who have thus been cleansed from evil spirits frequently both believe [in Christ], and join themselves to the Church. Others have foreknowledge of things to come: they see visions, and utter prophetic expressions. Others still, heal the sick by laying their hands upon them, and they are made whole. Yea, moreover, as I have said, the dead even have been raised up, and remained&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3274"></A><A HREF="#fn_3274"><FONT SIZE="1">3275</FONT></A>
 among us for many years. And what shall I more say? <a name="ix.iii.xxxiii-p14.2"></A>It is not possible to name the number of the gifts which the Church, [scattered] throughout the whole world, has received from God, in the name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and which she exerts day by day for the benefit of the Gentiles, neither practising deception upon any, nor taking any reward&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3275"></A><A HREF="#fn_3275"><FONT SIZE="1">3276</FONT></A>
 from them [on account of such miraculous interpositions]. For as she has received freely&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3276"></A><A HREF="#fn_3276"><FONT SIZE="1">3277</FONT></A>
 from God, freely also does she minister [to others].</p>  
<p><a name="ix.iii.xxxiii-p17"></A>5. <a name="ix.iii.xxxiii-p17.1"></A>Nor does she perform anything by means of angelic invocations,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3277"></A><A HREF="#fn_3277"><FONT SIZE="1">3278</FONT></A>
 or by incantations, or by any other wicked curious art; but, directing her prayers to the Lord, who made all things, in a pure, sincere, and straightforward spirit, and calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, she has been accustomed to work&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3278"></A><A HREF="#fn_3278"><FONT SIZE="1">3279</FONT></A>
 miracles for the advantage of mankind, and not to lead them into error. If, therefore, the name of our Lord Jesus Christ even now confers benefits [upon men], and cures thoroughly and effectively all who anywhere believe on Him, but not that of Simon, or Menander, or Carpocrates, or of any other man whatever, it is manifest that, when He was made man, He held fellowship with His own creation, and&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3279"></A><A HREF="#fn_3279"><FONT SIZE="1">3280</FONT></A>
 did all things truly through the power of God, according to the will of the Father of all, as the prophets had foretold. But what these things were, shall be described in dealing with the proofs to be found in the prophetical writings.</p>

Possibly the venerable Father is speaking from his own personal recollection of some who had been raised from the dead, and had continued for a time living witnesses of the efficacy of Christian faith.&#8221; [See cap. xxxi., <i>supra</i>.]</p>
