### <span id="v.xvii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Farewells and cautions.

<span id="v.xvii.xiv-p1"></span>Let your prayers be extended to the
Church of Antioch, whence also I as a prisoner am being led to Rome. I
salute the holy bishop Polycarp; I salute the holy bishop Vitalius, and
the sacred presbytery, and my fellow-servants the deacons; in whose
stead may my soul be found. Once more I bid farewell to the bishop, and
to the presbyters in the Lord. If any one celebrates the passover along
with the Jews, or receives the emblems of their feast, he is a partaker
with those that killed the Lord and His apostles.
