<p> <a name="viii.vii.v"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.vii.v-p0.1"></A>Chapter V.&#8212;The vain pretensions of false gods.</h3>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p1"></A><a name="viii.vii.v-p1.1"></A><a name="viii.vii.v-p1.2"></A>But concerning those who think that they shall share the holy and perfect name, which some have received by a vain tradition as if they were gods, Menander in the <i>Auriga</i> says:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p1.3"></A>&#8220;If there exists a god who walketh out<br>  With an old woman, or who enters in<br>  By stealth to houses through the folding-doors,<br>  He ne&#146;er can please me; nay, but only he<br>  Who stays at home, a just and righteous God,<br>  To give salvation to His worshippers.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p2"></A>The same Menander, in the <i>Sacerdos</i>, says:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p2.1"></A>&#8220;There is no God, O woman, that can save<br>  One man by another; if indeed a man,<br>  With sound of tinkling cymbals, charm a god<br>  Where&#146;er he listeth, then assuredly<br>  He who doth so is much the greater god.<br>  But these, O Rhode, are but the cunning schemes<br>  Which daring men of intrigue, unabashed,<br>  Invent to earn themselves a livelihood,<br>  And yield a laughing-stock unto the age.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p3"></A>Again, the same Menander, stating his opinion about those who are received as gods, proving rather that they are not so, says:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p3.1"></A>&#8220;Yea, if I this beheld, I then should wish<br>  That back to me again my soul returned.<br>  For tell me where, O Getas, in the world<br>  &#146;Tis possible to find out righteous gods?&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p4"></A>And in the <i>Depositum</i>:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p4.1"></A>&#8220;There&#146;s an unrighteous judgment, as it seems,<br>  Even with the gods.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p5"></A><a name="viii.vii.v-p5.1"></A>And Euripides the tragedian, in <i>Orestes</i>, says:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p5.2"></A>&#8220;Apollo having caused by his command<br>  The murder of the mother, knoweth not<br>  What honesty and justice signify.<br>  We serve the gods, whoever they may be;<br>  But from the central regions of the earth<br>  You see Apollo plainly gives response<br>  To mortals, and whate&#146;er he says we do.<br>  I him obeyed, when she that bore me fell<br>  Slain by my hand: he is the wicked man.<br>  Then slay him, for &#146;twas he that sinned, not I.<br>  What could I do? Think you not that the god<br>  Should free me from the blame which I do bear?&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p6"></A>The same also in <i>Hippolytus</i>:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p6.1"></A>&#8220;But on these points the gods do not judge right.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p7"></A>And in <i>Ion</i>:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p7.1"></A>&#8220;But in the daughter of Erechtheus<br>  What interest have I? for that pertains<br>  Not unto such as me. But when I come<br>  With golden vessels for libations, I<br>  The dew shall sprinkle, and yet needs must warn<br>  Apollo of his deeds; for when he weds<br>  Maidens by force, the children secretly<br>  Begotten he betrays, and then neglects<br>  When dying. Thus not you; but while you may<br>  Always pursue the virtues, for the gods<br>  Will surely punish men of wickedness.<br>  How is it right that you, who have prescribed<br>  Laws for men&#146;s guidance, live unrighteously?<br>  But ye being absent, I shall freely speak,<br>  And ye to men shall satisfaction give<br>  For marriage forced, thou Neptune, Jupiter,<br>  Who over heaven presides. The temples ye<br>  Have emptied, while injustice ye repay.<br>  And though ye laud the prudent to the skies,<br>  Yet have ye filled your hands with wickedness.<br>  No longer is it right to call men ill<br>  If they do imitate the sins&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2606"></A><A HREF="#fn_2606"><FONT SIZE="1">2607</FONT></A>
 of gods;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2607"></A><A HREF="#fn_2607"><FONT SIZE="1">2608</FONT></A>
 <br>  Nay, evil let their teachers rather be.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p10"></A>And in <i>Archelaus</i>:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p10.1"></A>&#8220;Full oft, my son, do gods mankind perplex.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p11"></A>And in <i>Bellerophon</i>:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p11.1"></A>&#8220;They are no gods, who do not what is right.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p12"></A>And again in the same:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p12.1"></A>&#8220;Gods reign in heaven most certainly, says one;<br>  But it is false,&#8212;and let not him<br>  Who speaks thus, be so foolish as to use<br>  Ancient tradition, or to pay regard<br>  Unto my words: but with unclouded eye<br>  Behold the matter in its clearest light.<br>  Power absolute, I say, robs men of life<br>  And property; transgresses plighted faith;<br>  Nor spares even cities, but with cruel hand<br>  Despoils and devastates them ruthlessly.<br>  But they that do these things have more success<br>  Than those who live a gentle pious life;<br>  And cities small, I know, which reverence gods,<br>  Submissive bend before the many spears<br>  Of larger impious ones; yea, and methinks<br>  If any man lounge idly, and abstain<br>  From working with his hands for sustenance,<br>  Yet pray the gods; he very soon will know<br>  If they from him misfortunes will avert.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p13"></A>And Menander in <i>Diphilus</i>:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2608"></A><A HREF="#fn_2608"><FONT SIZE="1">2609</FONT></A>
&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p14.1"></A>&#8220;Therefore ascribe we praise and honour great<br>  To Him who Father is, and Lord of all;<br>  Sole maker and preserver of mankind,<br>  And who with all good things our earth has stored.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p15"></A>The same also in the <i>Piscatores</i>:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p15.1"></A>&#8220;For I deem that which nourishes my life<br>  Is God; but he whose custom &#146;tis to meet<br>  The wants of men,&#8212;He needs not at our hands<br>  Renewed supplies, Himself being all in all.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2609"></A><A HREF="#fn_2609"><FONT SIZE="1">2610</FONT></A>
 <br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p17"></A>The same in the <i>Fratres</i>:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p17.1"></A>&#8220;God ever is intelligence to those<br>  Who righteous are: so wisest men have thought.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p18"></A>And in the <i>Tibicin&aelig;</i>:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p18.1"></A>&#8220;Good reason finds a temple in all things<br>  Wherein to worship; for what is the mind,<br>  But just the voice of God within us placed?&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p19"></A>  <A NAME="page_293"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 293</FONT></A> <a name="viii.vii.v-Page_293"></A>  <a name="viii.vii.v-p19.1"></A>And the tragedian in <i>Phrixus</i>:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p19.2"></A>&#8220;But if the pious and the impious<br>  Share the same lot, how could we think it just,<br>  If Jove, the best, judges not uprightly?&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p20"></A>In <i>Philoctetes</i>:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p20.1"></A>&#8220;You see how honourable gain is deemed<br>  Even to the gods; and how he is admired<br>  Whose shrine is laden most with yellow gold.<br>  What, then, doth hinder thee, since it is good<br>  To be like gods, from thus accepting gain?&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p21"></A>In <i>Hecuba</i>:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p21.1"></A>&#8220;O Jupiter I whoever thou mayest be,<br>  Of whom except in word all knowledge fails;&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="viii.vii.v-p22"></A>and,&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.v-p22.1"></A>&#8220;Jupiter, whether thou art indeed<br>  A great necessity, or the mind of man,<br>  I worship thee!&#8221;<br> </blockquote>
