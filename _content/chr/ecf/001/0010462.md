### <span id="viii.iv.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Introduction.

<span id="viii.iv.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv.i-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.i-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.iv.i-p1.3"></span><span
class="upper"><span id="viii.iv.i-p1.4"></span>While</span> I was going
about one morning in the walks of the Xystus, <span
id="fr_1947"></span>[1948](#fn_1947) a certain man, with others in his
company, having met me, and said, “Hail, O philosopher!” And immediately
after saying this, he turned round and walked along with me; his friends
likewise followed him. And I in turn having addressed him, said, “What
is there important?”

<span id="viii.iv.i-p3"></span>And he replied, “I was instructed,” says
he “by Corinthus the Socratic in Argos, that I ought not to despise or
treat with indifference those who array themselves in this dress <span
id="fr_1948"></span>[1949](#fn_1948) but to show them all kindness, and
to associate with them, as perhaps some advantage would spring from the
intercourse either to some such man or to myself. It is good, moreover,
for both, if either the one or the other be benefited. On this account,
therefore, whenever I see any one in such costume, I gladly approach
him, and now, for the same reason, have I willingly accosted you; and
these accompany me, in the expectation of hearing for themselves
something profitable from you.”

<span id="viii.iv.i-p5"></span>“But who are you, most excellent man?” So
I replied to him in jest. <span id="fr_1949"></span>[1950](#fn_1949)

<span id="viii.iv.i-p7"></span>Then he told me frankly both his name and
his family. “Trypho,” says he, “I am called; and I am a Hebrew of the
circumcision, <span id="fr_1950"></span>[1951](#fn_1950) and having
escaped from the war <span id="fr_1951"></span>[1952](#fn_1951) lately
carried on there I am spending my days in Greece, and chiefly at
Corinth.”

<span id="viii.iv.i-p10"></span>“And in what,” said I, “would you be
profited by philosophy so much as by your own lawgiver and the
prophets?”

<span id="viii.iv.i-p11"></span>“Why not?” he replied. “Do not the
philosophers turn every discourse on God? and do not questions
continually arise to them about His unity and providence? Is not this
truly the duty of philosophy, to investigate the Deity?”

<span id="viii.iv.i-p12"></span>“Assuredly,” said I, “so we too have
believed. But the most <span id="fr_1952"></span>[1953](#fn_1952) have
not taken thought of this whether there be one or more gods, and whether
they have a regard for each one of us or no, as if this knowledge
contributed nothing to our happiness; nay, they moreover attempt to
persuade us that God takes care of the universe with its genera and
species, but not of me and you, and each individually, since otherwise
we would surely not need to pray to Him night and day. But it is not
difficult to understand the upshot of this; for fearlessness and license
in speaking result to such as maintain these opinions, doing and saying
whatever they choose, neither dreading punishment nor hoping for any
benefit from God. For how could they? They affirm that the same things
shall always happen; and, further, that I and you shall again live in
like manner, having become neither better men nor worse. But there are
some others, <span id="fr_1953"></span>[1954](#fn_1953) who, having
supposed the soul to be immortal and immaterial, believe that though
they have committed evil they will not suffer punishment (for that which
is immaterial is insensible), and that the soul, in consequence of its
immortality, needs nothing from God.”

<span id="viii.iv.i-p15"></span>And he, smiling gently, said, “Tell us
your opinion of these matters, and what idea you entertain respecting
God, and what your philosophy is.”
