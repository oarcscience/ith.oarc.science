### <span id="viii.vi.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Inconsistencies of Plato’s doctrine.

<span id="viii.vi.vii-p1"></span><span id="viii.vi.vii-p1.1"></span>But
in these things they are convicted of thinking in contradiction to each
other. And if any one will accurately criticise their writings, they
have chosen to abide in harmony not even with their own opinions. Plato,
at any rate, at one time says that there are three first principles of
the universe—God, and matter, and form; but at another time four, for he
adds the universal soul. And again, when he has already said that matter
is eternal, <span id="fr_2528"></span>[2529](#fn_2528) he afterwards
says that it is produced; and when he has first given to form its
peculiar rank as a first principle, and has asserted for its
self-subsistence, he afterwards says that this same thing is among the
things perceived by the understanding. Moreover, having first declared
that everything that is made is mortal <span
id="fr_2529"></span>[2530](#fn_2529) he afterwards states that some of
the things that are made are indestructible and immortal. What, then, is
the cause why those who have been esteemed wise among you disagree not
only with one another but also with themselves? Manifestly, their
unwillingness to learn from those who know, and their desire to attain
accurate knowledge of things heavenly by their own human excess of
wisdom though they were able to understand not even earthly matters.
Certainly some of your philosophers say that the human soul is in us;
others, that it is around us. For not even in this did they choose to
agree with one another, but, distributing, as it were, ignorance in
various ways among themselves, they thought fit to wrangle and dispute
with one another even about the soul. For some of them say that the soul
is fire, and some that it is the air; and others, the mind; and others,
motion; and others, an exhalation; and certain others say that it is a
power flowing from the stars; and others, number capable of motion; and
others, a generating water. And a wholly confused and inharmonious
opinion has prevailed among them, which only in this one respect appears
praiseworthy to those who can form a right judgment, that they have been
anxious to convict one another of error and falsehood.
