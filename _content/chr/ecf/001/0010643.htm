<p><a name="viii.vi.xxxiii-p1"></A><a name="viii.vi.xxxiii-p1.1"></A><a name="viii.vi.xxxiii-p1.2"></A>And from what source did Plato draw the information that time was created along with the heavens? For he wrote thus: &#8220;Time, accordingly, was created along with the heavens; in order that, coming into being together, they might also be together dissolved, if ever their dissolution should take place.&#8221; Had he not learned this from the divine history of Moses? For he knew that the creation of time had received its original constitution from days and months and years. Since, then, the first day which was created along with the heavens constituted the beginning of all time (for thus Moses wrote, &#8220;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,&#8221; and then immediately subjoins, &#8220;And one day was made,&#8221; as if he would designate the whole of time by one part of it), Plato names the day &#8220;time,&#8221; lest, if he mentioned the &#8220;day,&#8221; he should seem to lay himself open to the accusation of the Athenians, that he was completely adopting the expressions of Moses. And from what source did he derive what he has written regarding the dissolution of the heavens? Had he not learned this, too, from the sacred prophets, and did he not think that this was their doctrine?</p>
