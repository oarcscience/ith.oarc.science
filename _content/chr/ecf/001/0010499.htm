<p> <a name="viii.iv.xxxviii"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.iv.xxxviii-p0.1"></A>Chapter XXXVIII.&#8212;It is an annoyance to the Jew that Christ is said to be adored. Justin confirms it, however, from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#000">Ps. xlv.</a><a name="viii.iv.xxxviii-p0.2"></A></h3>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.xxxviii-p1"></A>And Trypho said, &#8220;Sir, it were good for us if we obeyed our teachers, who laid down a law that we should have no intercourse with any of you, and that we should not have even any communication with you on these questions. For you utter many blasphemies, in that you seek to persuade us that this crucified man was with Moses and Aaron, and spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud; then that he became man, was crucified, and ascended up to heaven, and comes again to earth, and ought to be worshipped.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.xxxviii-p2"></A>Then I answered, &#8220;I know that, as the word of God says, this great wisdom of God, the Maker of all things, and the Almighty, is hid from you. Wherefore, in sympathy with you, I am striving to the utmost that you may understand these matters which to you are paradoxical; but if not, that I myself may be innocent in the day of judgment. For you shall hear other words which appear still more paradoxical; but be not confounded, nay, rather remain still more zealous hearers and investigators, despising the tradition of your teachers, since they are convicted by the Holy Spirit of inability to perceive the truths taught by God, and of preferring to teach their own doctrines. <a name="viii.iv.xxxviii-p2.1"></A><a name="viii.iv.xxxviii-p2.2"></A><a name="viii.iv.xxxviii-p2.3"></A>Accordingly, in the forty-fourth [forty-fifth] Psalm, these words are in like manner referred to Christ: &#145;My heart has brought forth a good matter;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2043"></A><A HREF="#fn_2043"><FONT SIZE="1">2044</FONT></A>
 I tell my works to the King. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer. Fairer in beauty than the sons of men: grace is poured forth into Thy lips: therefore hath God blessed Thee for ever. Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O mighty One. Press on in Thy fairness and in Thy beauty, and prosper and reign, because of truth, and of meekness, and of righteousness: and Thy right hand shall instruct Thee marvellously. Thine arrows are sharpened, O mighty One; the people shall fall under Thee; in the heart of the enemies of the King [the arrows are fixed]. Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of equity  <A NAME="page_214"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 214</FONT></A> <a name="viii.iv.xxxviii-Page_214"></A>  is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hast hated iniquity; therefore thy God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2044"></A><A HREF="#fn_2044"><FONT SIZE="1">2045</FONT></A>
 hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows. [He hath anointed Thee] with myrrh,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2045"></A><A HREF="#fn_2045"><FONT SIZE="1">2046</FONT></A>
 and oil, and cassia, from Thy garments; from the ivory palaces, whereby they made Thee glad. Kings&#146; daughters are in Thy honour. The queen stood at Thy right hand, clad in garments&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2046"></A><A HREF="#fn_2046"><FONT SIZE="1">2047</FONT></A>
 embroidered with gold. Hearken, O daughter, and behold, and incline thine ear, and forget thy people and the house of thy father: and the King shall desire thy beauty; because He is thy Lord, they shall worship Him also. And the daughter of Tyre [shall be there] with gifts. The rich of the people shall entreat Thy face. All the glory of the King&#146;s daughter [is] within, clad in embroidered garments of needlework. The virgins that follow her shall be brought to the King; her neighbours shall be brought unto Thee: they shall be brought with joy and gladness: they shall be led into the King&#146;s shrine. Instead of thy fathers, thy sons have been born: Thou shalt appoint them rulers over all the earth. I shall remember Thy name in every generation: therefore the people shall confess Thee for ever, and for ever and ever.&#146;</p>
