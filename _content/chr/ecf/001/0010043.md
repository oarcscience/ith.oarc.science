### <span id="ii.ii.xxxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII.—Let the members of the Church submit themselves, and no one exalt himself above another.

<span id="ii.ii.xxxviii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxxviii-p1.2"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxxviii-p1.3"></span>Let
our whole body, then, be preserved in, Christ Jesus; and let every one
be subject to his neighbour, according to the special gift <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165) bestowed upon him. Let the strong not
despise the weak, and let the weak show respect unto the strong. Let the
rich man provide for the wants of the poor; and let the poor man bless
God, because He hath given him one by whom his need may be supplied. Let
the wise man display his wisdom, not by \[mere\] words, but through good
deeds. Let the humble not bear testimony to himself, but leave witness
to be borne to him by another. <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166)
Let him that is pure in the flesh not grow proud <span
id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167) of it, and boast, knowing that it was
another who bestowed on him the gift of continence. Let us consider,
then, brethren, of what matter we were made,—who and what manner of
beings we came into the world, as it were out of a sepulchre, and from
utter darkness. <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168) He who made us
and fashioned us, having prepared His bountiful gifts for us before we
were born, introduced us into His world. <span
id="ii.ii.xxxviii-p5.2"></span>Since, therefore, we receive all these
things from Him, we ought for everything to give Him thanks; to whom be
glory for ever and ever. Amen.
