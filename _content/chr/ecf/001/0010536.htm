<p> <a name="viii.iv.lxxv"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.iv.lxxv-p0.1"></A>Chapter LXXV.&#8212;It is proved that Jesus was the name of God in the book of Exodus.</h3>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.lxxv-p1"></A><a name="viii.iv.lxxv-p1.1"></A><a name="viii.iv.lxxv-p1.2"></A><a name="viii.iv.lxxv-p1.3"></A>&#8220;Moreover, in the book of Exodus we have also perceived that the name of God Himself which, He says, was not revealed to Abraham or to Jacob, was Jesus, and was declared mysteriously through Moses. Thus it is written: &#145;And the Lord spake to Moses, Say to this people, Behold, I send My angel before thy face, to keep thee in the way, to bring thee into the land which I have prepared for thee. Give heed to Him, and obey Him; do not disobey Him. For He will not draw back from you; for My name is in Him.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2229"></A><A HREF="#fn_2229"><FONT SIZE="1">2230</FONT></A>
 Now understand that He who led your fathers into the land is called by this name Jesus, and first called Auses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2230"></A><A HREF="#fn_2230"><FONT SIZE="1">2231</FONT></A>
 (Oshea). For if you shall understand this, you shall likewise perceive that the name of Him who said to Moses, &#145;for My name is in Him,&#146; was Jesus. For, indeed, He was also called Israel, and Jacob&#146;s name was changed to this also. Now Isaiah shows that those prophets who are sent to publish tidings from God are called His angels and apostles. For Isaiah says in a certain place, &#145;Send me.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2231"></A><A HREF="#fn_2231"><FONT SIZE="1">2232</FONT></A>
 And that the prophet whose name was changed, Jesus [Joshua], was strong and great, is manifest to all. If, then, we know that God revealed Himself in so many forms to Abraham, and to Jacob, and to Moses, how are we at a loss, and do not believe that, according to the will of the Father of all things, it was possible for Him to be born man of the Virgin, especially after we have such&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2232"></A><A HREF="#fn_2232"><FONT SIZE="1">2233</FONT></A>
 Scriptures, from which it can be plainly perceived that He became so according to the will of the Father?</p>
