 again shall bear testimony to me:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vii.iv-p2.1"></A>&#8220;If any one should dream, O Pamphilus,<br>  By sacrifice of bulls or goats&#8212;nay, then,<br>  By Jupiter&#8212;of any such like things;<br>  Or by presenting gold or purple robes,<br>  Or images of ivory and gems;<br>  If thus he thinks he may propitiate God,<br>  He errs, and shows himself a silly one.<br>  But let him rather useful be, and good,<br>  Committing neither theft nor lustful deeds,<br>  Nor murder foul, for earthly riches&#146; sake.<br>  Let him of no man covet wife or child,<br>  His splendid house, his wide-spread property,<br>  His maiden, or his slave born ill his house,<br>  His horses, or his cattle, or his beeves,<br>  Nay, covet not a pin, O Pamphilus,<br>  For God, close by you, sees whate&#146;er you do.<br>  He ever with the wicked man is wroth,<br>  But in the righteous takes a pleasure still,<br>  Permitting him to reap fruit of his toil,<br>  And to enjoy the bread his sweat has won.<br>  But being righteous, see thou pay thy vows,<br>  And unto God the giver offer gifts.<br>  Place thy adorning not in outward shows,<br>  But in an inward purity of heart;<br>  Hearing the thunder then, thou shall not fear,<br>  Nor shall thou flee, O master, at its voice,<br>  For thou art conscious of no evil deed,<br>  And God, close by you, sees whate&#146;er you do.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>

 says: &#8220;But if any one on consideration should actually institute  <A NAME="page_292"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 292</FONT></A> <a name="viii.vii.iv-Page_292"></A>  a rigid inquiry, he would be ignorant of the distinction between the human and the divine nature; because God mingles many&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2605"></A><A HREF="#fn_2605"><FONT SIZE="1">2606</FONT></A>
 things up into one, [and again is able to dissolve one into many things,] seeing that He is endued with knowledge and power; but no man either is, or ever shall be, able to perform any of these.&#8221;</p>
