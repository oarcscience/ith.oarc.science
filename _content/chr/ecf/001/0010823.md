### <span id="ix.vi.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—Those persons prove themselves senseless who exaggerate the mercy of Christ, but are silent as to the judgment, and look only at the more abundant grace of the New Testament; but, forgetful of the greater degree of perfection which it demands from us, they endeavour to show that there is another God beyond Him who created the world.

<span id="ix.vi.xxix-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vi.xxix-p1.1"></span>Inasmuch, then, as in both Testaments there
is the same righteousness of God \[displayed\] when God takes vengeance,
in the one case indeed typically, temporarily, and more moderately; but
in the other, really, enduringly, and more rigidly: for the fire is
eternal, and the wrath of God which shall be revealed from heaven from
the face of our Lord (as David also says, “But the face of the Lord is
against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the
earth” <span id="fr_4197"></span>[4198](#fn_4197) ), entails a heavier
punishment on those who incur it,—the elders pointed out that those men
are devoid of sense, who, \[arguing\] from what happened to those who
formerly did not obey God, do endeavour to bring in another Father,
setting over against \[these punishments\] what great things the Lord
had done at His coming to save those who received Him, taking compassion
upon them; while they keep silence with regard to His judgment; and all
those things which shall come upon such as have heard His words, but
done them not, and that it were better for them if they had not been
born, <span id="fr_4198"></span>[4199](#fn_4198) and that it shall be
more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the judgment than for that city
which did not receive the word of His disciples. <span
id="fr_4199"></span>[4200](#fn_4199)

<span id="ix.vi.xxix-p5"></span>2. For as, in the New Testament, that
faith of men \[to be placed\] in God has been increased, receiving in
addition \[to what was already revealed\] the Son of God, that man too
might be a partaker of God; so is also our walk in life required to be
more circumspect, when we are directed not merely to abstain from evil
actions, but even from evil thoughts, and from idle words, and empty
talk, and scurrilous language: <span
id="fr_4200"></span>[4201](#fn_4200) thus also the punishment of those
who do not believe the Word of God, and despise His advent, and are
turned away backwards, is increased; being not merely temporal, but
rendered also eternal. For to whomsoever the Lord shall say, “Depart
from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,” <span
id="fr_4201"></span>[4202](#fn_4201) these shall be damned for ever; and
to whomsoever He shall say, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the
kingdom prepared for you for eternity,” <span
id="fr_4202"></span>[4203](#fn_4202) these do receive the kingdom for
ever, and make constant advance in it; since there is one and the same
God the Father, and His Word, who has been always present with the human
race, by means indeed of various dispensations, and has wrought out many
things, and saved from the beginning those who are saved, (for these are
they who love God, and follow the Word of God according to the class to
which they belong,) and has judged those who are judged, that is, those
who forget God, and are blasphemous, and transgressors of His word.

<span id="ix.vi.xxix-p9"></span>3. For the self-same heretics already
mentioned by us have fallen away from themselves, by accusing the Lord,
in whom they say that they believe. For those points to which they call
attention with regard to the God who then awarded temporal punishments
to the unbelieving, and smote the Egyptians, while He saved those that
were obedient; these same \[facts, I say,\] shall nevertheless repeat
themselves in the Lord, who judges for eternity those whom He doth
judge, and lets go free for eternity those whom He does let go free: and
He shall \[thus\] be discovered, according to the language used by these
men, as having been the cause of their most heinous sin to those who
laid hands upon Him, and pierced Him. For if He had not so come, it
follows that these men could not have become the slayers of their Lord;
and if He had not sent prophets to them, they certainly could not have
killed them, nor the apostles either. To those, therefore, who assail
us, and say, If the Egyptians had not been afflicted with plagues, and,
when pursuing after Israel, been choked in the sea, God could not have
saved His people, this answer may be given;—Unless, then, the Jews had
become the slayers of the Lord (which did, indeed, take eternal life
away from them), and, by killing the apostles and persecuting the
Church, had fallen into an abyss of wrath, we could not have been saved.
For as they were saved by means of the blindness of the Egyptians, so
are we, too, by that of the Jews; if, indeed, the death of the Lord is
the condemnation of those who fastened Him to the cross, and who did not
believe His advent, but the salvation of those who believe in Him. For
the apostle does also say in the Second \[Epistle\] to the Corinthians:
“For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them which are saved,
and in them which perish: to the one indeed the savour of death unto
death, <span id="page_502">p. 502</span> <span
id="ix.vi.xxix-Page_502"></span> but to the other the savour of life
unto life.” <span id="fr_4203"></span>[4204](#fn_4203) To whom, then, is
there the savour of death unto death, unless to those who believe not
neither are subject to the Word of God? And who are they that did even
then give themselves over to death? Those men, doubtless, who do not
believe, nor submit themselves to God. And again, who are they that have
been saved and received the inheritance? Those, doubtless, who do
believe God, and who have continued in His love; as did Caleb \[the
son\] of Jephunneh and Joshua \[the son\] of Nun, <span
id="fr_4204"></span>[4205](#fn_4204) and innocent children, <span
id="fr_4205"></span>[4206](#fn_4205) who have had no sense of evil. But
who are they that are saved now, and receive life eternal? Is it not
those who love God, and who believe His promises, and who “in malice
have become as little children?” <span
id="fr_4206"></span>[4207](#fn_4206)
