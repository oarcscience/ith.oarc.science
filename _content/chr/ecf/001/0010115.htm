 nature of his martyrdom, and [considered] the blameless life he had led from the beginning, and how he was now crowned with the wreath of immortality, having beyond dispute received his reward, he did his utmost that not the least memorial of him should be taken away by us, although many desired to do this, and to become possessors&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_463"></A><A HREF="#fn_463"><FONT SIZE="1">464</FONT></A>
 of his holy flesh. For this end he suggested it to Nicetes, the father of Herod and brother of Alce, to go and entreat the governor not to give up his body to be buried, &#8220;lest,&#8221; said he, &#8220;forsaking Him  <A NAME="page_43"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 43</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iv.xvii-Page_43"></A>  that was crucified, they begin to worship this one.&#8221; This he said at the suggestion and urgent persuasion of the Jews, who also watched us, as we sought to take him out of the fire, being ignorant of this, that it is neither possible for us ever to forsake Christ, who suffered for the salvation of such as shall be saved throughout the whole world (the blameless one for sinners&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_464"></A><A HREF="#fn_464"><FONT SIZE="1">465</FONT></A>
), nor to worship any other. For Him indeed, as being the Son of God, we adore; but the martyrs, as disciples and followers of the Lord, we worthily love on account of their extraordinary&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_465"></A><A HREF="#fn_465"><FONT SIZE="1">466</FONT></A>
 affection towards their own King and Master, of whom may we also be made companions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_466"></A><A HREF="#fn_466"><FONT SIZE="1">467</FONT></A>
