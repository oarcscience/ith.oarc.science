### <span id="ii.ii.xlix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLIX.—The praise of love.

<span id="ii.ii.xlix-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xlix-p1.1"></span>Let
him who has love in Christ keep the commandments of Christ. Who can
describe the \[blessed\] bond of the love of God? What man is able to
tell the excellence of its beauty, as it ought to be told? The height to
which love exalts is unspeakable. Love unites us to God. Love covers a
multitude of sins. <span id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220) Love beareth
all things, is long-suffering in all things. <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221) There is nothing base, nothing
arrogant in love. Love admits of no schisms: love gives rise to no
seditions: love does all things in harmony. By love have all the elect
of God been made perfect; without love nothing is well-pleasing to God.
In love has the Lord taken us to Himself. On account of the Love he bore
us, Jesus Christ our Lord gave His blood for us by the will of God; His
flesh for our flesh, and His soul for our souls. <span
