### <span id="v.xv.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Duties of husbands, wives, parents, and children.

<span id="v.xv.ix-p1"></span><span id="v.xv.ix-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.xv.ix-p1.2"></span>Let the husbands love their wives, remembering
that, at the creation, one woman, and not many, was given to one man.
Let the wives honour their husbands, as their own flesh; and let them
not presume to address them by their names. <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[1250](#fn_1249) Let them also be chaste, reckoning
their husbands as their only partners, to whom indeed they have been
united according to the will of God. Ye parents, impart a holy training
to your children. Ye children, “honour your parents, that it may be well
with you.” <span id="fr_1250"></span>[1251](#fn_1250)
