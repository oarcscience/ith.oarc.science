<p><a name="viii.xi.ii-p1"></A>Rusticus the prefect said, &#8220;Where do you assemble?&#8221; Justin said, &#8220;Where each one chooses and can: for do you fancy that we all meet in the very same place? Not so; because the God of the Christians is not circumscribed by place; but being invisible, fills heaven and earth, and everywhere is worshipped and glorified by the faithful.&#8221; Rusticus the prefect said, &#8220;Tell me where you assemble, or into what place do you collect your followers?&#8221; Justin said, &#8220;I live above one Martinus, at the Timiotinian Bath; and during the whole time (and I am now living in Rome for the second time) I am unaware of any other meeting than his. And if any one wished to come to me, I communicated to him the doctrines of truth.&#8221; Rusticus said, &#8220;Are you not, then, a Christian?&#8221; Justin said, &#8220;Yes, I am a Christian.&#8221;</p>
