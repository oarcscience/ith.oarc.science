<p> <a name="viii.iv.xciv"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.iv.xciv-p0.1"></A>Chapter XCIV.&#8212;In what sense he who hangs on a tree is cursed.</h3>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.xciv-p1"></A><a name="viii.iv.xciv-p1.1"></A><a name="viii.iv.xciv-p1.2"></A>&#8220;For tell me, was it not God who commanded by Moses that no image or likeness of anything which was in heaven above or which was on the earth should be made, and yet who caused the brazen serpent to be made by Moses in the wilderness, and set it up for a sign by which those bitten by serpents were saved? Yet is He free from unrighteousness. For by this, as I previously remarked, He proclaimed the mystery, by which He declared that He would break the power of the serpent which occasioned the transgression of Adam, and [would bring] to them that believe on Him [who was foreshadowed] by this sign, i.e., Him who was to be crucified, salvation from the fangs of the serpent, which are wicked deeds, idolatries, and other unrighteous acts. Unless the matter be so understood, give me a reason why Moses set up the brazen serpent for a sign, and bade those that were bitten gaze at it, and the wounded were healed; and this, too, when he had himself commanded that no likeness of anything whatsoever should be made.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.xciv-p2"></A>On this, another of those who came on the second day said, &#8220;You have spoken truly: we cannot give a reason. For I have frequently interrogated the teachers about this matter, and none of them gave me a reason: therefore continue what you are speaking; for we are paying attention while you unfold the mystery, on account of which the doctrines of the prophets are falsely slandered.&#8221;</p>
