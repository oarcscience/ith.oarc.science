<p> <a name="ix.vii.xxvi"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="ix.vii.xxvi-p0.1"></A>Chapter XXV.&#8212;The fraud, pride, and tyrannical kingdom of Antichrist, as described by Daniel and Paul.</h3>  
<p><a name="ix.vii.xxvi-p1"></A>1. <a name="ix.vii.xxvi-p1.1"></A>And not only by the particulars already mentioned, but also by means of the events which shall occur in the time of Antichrist is it shown that he, being an apostate and a robber, is anxious to be adored as God; and that, although a mere slave, he wishes himself to be proclaimed as a king. For he (Antichrist) being endued with all the power of the devil, shall come, not as a righteous king, nor as a legitimate king, [i.e., one] in subjection to God, but an impious, unjust, and lawless one; as an apostate, iniquitous and murderous; as a robber, concentrating in himself [all] satanic apostasy, and setting aside idols to persuade [men] that he himself is God, raising up himself as the only idol, having in himself the multifarious errors of the other idols. This he does, in order that they who do [now] worship the devil by means of many abominations, may serve himself by this one idol, of whom the apostle thus speaks in the second Epistle to the Thessalonians: &#8220;Unless there shall come a failing away first, and the man of sin shall be revealed, the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself as if he were God.&#8221; The apostle therefore clearly points out his apostasy, and that he is lifted up above all that is called God, or that is worshipped&#8212;that is, above every idol &#8212;for these are indeed so called by men, but are not [really] gods; and that he will endeavour in a tyrannical manner to set himself forth as God.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.vii.xxvi-p2"></A>2. Moreover, he (the apostle) has also pointed out this which I have shown in many ways, that the temple in Jerusalem was made by the direction of the true God. For the apostle himself, speaking in his own person, distinctly called it the temple of God. Now I have shown in the third book, that no one is termed God by the apostles when speaking for themselves, except Him who truly is God, the Father of our Lord, by whose directions the temple which is at Jerusalem was constructed for those purposes which I have already mentioned; in which [temple] the enemy shall sit, endeavouring to show himself as Christ, as the Lord also declares: &#8220;But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, which has been spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him that readeth understand), then let those who are in Judea flee into the mountains; and he who is upon the house-top, let him not come down to take anything out of his house: for there shall then be great hardship, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall be.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4663"></A><A HREF="#fn_4663"><FONT SIZE="1">4664</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="ix.vii.xxvi-p4"></A>3. Daniel too, looking forward to the end of the last kingdom, i.e., the ten last kings, amongst whom the kingdom of those men shall be partitioned, and upon whom the son of perdition shall come, declares that ten horns shall spring from the beast, and that another little horn shall arise in the midst of them, and that three of the former shall be rooted up before his face. He says: &#8220;And, behold, eyes were in this horn as the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things, and his look was more stout than his fellows. I was looking, and this horn made war against the saints, and prevailed against them, until the Ancient of days came and gave judgment to the saints of the most high God, and the time came, and the saints obtained the kingdom.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4664"></A><A HREF="#fn_4664"><FONT SIZE="1">4665</FONT></A>
 Then, further on, in the interpretation of the vision, there was said to him: &#8220;The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall excel all other kingdoms, and devour the whole earth, and tread it down, and cut it in pieces. And its ten horns are ten kings which shall arise; and after them shall arise another, who shall surpass in evil deeds all that were before  <A NAME="page_554"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 554</FONT></A> <a name="ix.vii.xxvi-Page_554"></A>  him, and shall overthrow three kings; and he shall speak words against the most high God, and wear out the saints of the most high God, and shall purpose to change times and laws; and [everything] shall be given into his hand until a time of times and a half time,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4665"></A><A HREF="#fn_4665"><FONT SIZE="1">4666</FONT></A>
 that is, for three years and six months, during which time, when he comes, he shall reign over the earth. Of whom also the Apostle Paul again, speaking in the second [Epistle] to the Thessalonians, and at the same time proclaiming the cause of his advent, thus says: &#8220;And then shall the wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the spirit of His mouth, and destroy by the presence of His coming; whose coming [i.e., the wicked one&#146;s] is after the working of Satan, in all power, and signs, and portents of lies, and with all deceivableness of wickedness for those who perish; because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And therefore God will send them the working of error, that they may believe a lie; that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but gave consent to iniquity,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4666"></A><A HREF="#fn_4666"><FONT SIZE="1">4667</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="ix.vii.xxvi-p8"></A>4. The Lord also spoke as follows to those who did not believe in Him: &#8220;I have come in my Father&#146;s name, and ye have not received Me: when another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4667"></A><A HREF="#fn_4667"><FONT SIZE="1">4668</FONT></A>
 calling Antichrist &#8220;the other,&#8221; because he is alienated from the Lord. This is also the unjust judge, whom the Lord mentioned as one &#8220;who feared not God, neither regarded man,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4668"></A><A HREF="#fn_4668"><FONT SIZE="1">4669</FONT></A>
 to whom the widow fled in her forgetfulness of God,&#8212;that is, the earthly Jerusalem,&#8212;to be avenged of her adversary. Which also he shall do in the time of his kingdom: he shall remove his kingdom into that [city], and shall sit in the temple of God, leading astray those who worship him, as if he were Christ. To this purpose Daniel says again: &#8220;And he shall desolate the holy place; and sin has been given for a sacrifice,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4669"></A><A HREF="#fn_4669"><FONT SIZE="1">4670</FONT></A>
 and righteousness been cast away in the earth, and he has been active (<i>fecit</i>), and gone on prosperously.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4670"></A><A HREF="#fn_4670"><FONT SIZE="1">4671</FONT></A>
 And the angel Gabriel, when explaining his vision, states with regard to this person: &#8220;And towards the end of their kingdom a king of a most fierce countenance shall arise, one understanding [dark] questions, and exceedingly powerful, full of wonders; and he shall corrupt, direct, influence (<i>faciet</i>), and put strong men down, the holy people likewise; and his yoke shall be directed as a wreath [round their neck]; deceit shall be in his hand, and he shall be lifted up in his heart: he shall also ruin many by deceit, and lead many to perdition, bruising them in his hand like eggs.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4671"></A><A HREF="#fn_4671"><FONT SIZE="1">4672</FONT></A>
 And then he points out the time that his tyranny shall last, during which the saints shall be put to flight, they who offer a pure sacrifice unto God: &#8220;And in the midst of the week,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the sacrifice and the libation shall be taken away, and the abomination of desolation [shall be brought] into the temple: even unto the consummation of the time shall the desolation be complete.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4672"></A><A HREF="#fn_4672"><FONT SIZE="1">4673</FONT></A>
 Now three years and six months constitute the half-week.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.vii.xxvi-p15"></A>5. From all these passages are revealed to us, not merely the particulars of the apostasy, and [the doings] of him who concentrates in himself every satanic error, but also, that there is one and the same God the Father, who was declared by the prophets, but made manifest by Christ. For if what Daniel prophesied concerning the end has been confirmed by the Lord, when He said, &#8220;When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, which has been spoken of by Daniel the prophet&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4673"></A><A HREF="#fn_4673"><FONT SIZE="1">4674</FONT></A>
 (and the angel Gabriel gave the interpretation of the visions to Daniel, and he is the archangel of the Creator (<i>Demiurgi</i>), who also proclaimed to Mary the visible coming and the incarnation of Christ), then one and the same God is most manifestly pointed out, who sent the prophets, and made promise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4674"></A><A HREF="#fn_4674"><FONT SIZE="1">4675</FONT></A>
 of the Son, and called us into His knowledge.</p>
