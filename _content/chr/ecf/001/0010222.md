## <span id="v.ix-p0.1"></span>Introductory Note to the Syriac Version of the Ignatian Epistles

<span id="v.ix-p1"></span><span id="v.ix-p1.1"></span><span
class="upper"><span id="v.ix-p1.2"></span>When</span> the Syriac version
of the Ignatian Epistles was introduced to the English world in 1845, by
Mr. Cureton, the greatest satisfaction was expressed by many, who
thought the inveterate controversy about to be settled. Lord Russell
made the learned divine a canon of Westminster Abbey, and the critical
Chevalier Bunsen <span id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129) committed
himself as its patron. To the credit of the learned, in general, the
work was gratefully received, and studied with scientific
conscientiousness by Lightfoot and others. The literature of this period
is valuable; and the result is decisive as to the Curetonian versions at
least, which are fragmentary and abridged, and yet they are a valuable
contribution to the study of the whole case.

<span id="v.ix-p3"></span>The following is the original <span
class="upper"><span id="v.ix-p3.1"></span>Introductory Notice</span>:—

<span id="v.ix-p4"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.ix-p4.1"></span>Some</span> account of the discovery of the Syriac
version of the Ignatian Epistles has been already given. We have simply
to add here a brief description of the <span class="upper"><span
id="v.ix-p4.2"></span>mss.</span> from which the Syriac text has been
printed. That which is named <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ix-p4.3"></span>α</span> by Cureton, contains only the Epistle to
Polycarp, and exhibits the text of that Epistle which, after him, we
have followed. He fixes its age somewhere in the first half of the sixth
century, or before the year 550. The second <span class="upper"><span
id="v.ix-p4.4"></span>ms.</span>, which Cureton refers to as <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ix-p4.5"></span>β</span>, is assigned by him
to the seventh or eighth century. It contains the three Epistles of
Ignatius, and furnishes the text here followed in the Epistles to the
Ephesians and Romans. The third <span class="upper"><span
id="v.ix-p4.6"></span>ms.</span>, which Cureton quotes as <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ix-p4.7"></span>γ</span>, has no date, but, as
he tells us, “belonged to the collection acquired by Moses of Nisibis in
<span class="upper"><span id="v.ix-p4.8"></span>a.d.</span> 931, and was
written apparently about three or four centuries earlier.” It contains
the three Epistles to Polycarp, the Ephesians, and the Romans. The text
of all these <span class="upper"><span id="v.ix-p4.9"></span>mss.</span>
is in several passages manifestly corrupt, and the translators appear at
times to have mistaken the meaning of the Greek original.

<span id="v.ix-p5"></span>\[N.B.—Bunsen is forced to allow the fact that
the discovery of the lost work of Hippolytus “throws new light on an
obscure point of the Ignatian controversy,” i.e., the *Sige* in the
Epistle to the Magnesians (cap. viii.); but his treatment of the matter
is unworthy of a candid scholar.\]
