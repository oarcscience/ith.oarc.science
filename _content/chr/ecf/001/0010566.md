### <span id="viii.iv.cv-p0.1"></span>Chapter CV.—The Psalm also predicts the crucifixion and the subject of the last prayers of Christ on Earth.

<span id="viii.iv.cv-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv.cv-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cv-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.iv.cv-p1.3"></span>“And what
follows of the Psalm,—‘But Thou, Lord, do not remove Thine assistance
from me; give heed to help me. Deliver my soul from the sword, and
my <span id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350) only-begotten from the
hand of the dog; save me from the lion’s mouth, and my humility from the
horns of the unicorns,’—was also information and prediction of the
events which should befall Him. For I have already proved that He was
the only-begotten of the Father of all things, being begotten in a
peculiar manner Word and Power by Him, and having afterwards become man
through the Virgin, as we have learned from the memoirs. Moreover, it is
similarly foretold that He would die by crucifixion. For the passage,
‘Deliver my soul from the sword, and my <span
id="fr_2351"></span>[2352](#fn_2351) only-begotten from the hand of the
dog; save me from the lion’s mouth, and my humility from the horns of
the unicorns,’ is indicative of the suffering by which He should <span
id="page_252">p. 252</span> <span id="viii.iv.cv-Page_252"></span> die,
i.e., by crucifixion. For the ‘horns of the, unicorns,’ I have already
explained to you, are the figure of the cross only. And the prayer that
His soul should be saved from the sword, and lion’s mouth, and hand of
the dog, was a prayer that no one should take possession of His soul: so
that, when we arrive at the end of life, we may ask the same petition
from God, who is able to turn away every shameless evil angel from
taking our souls. And that the souls survive, I have shown <span
id="fr_2352"></span>[2353](#fn_2352) to you from the fact that the soul
of Samuel was called up by the witch, as Saul demanded. And it appears
also, that all the souls of similar righteous men and prophets fell
under the dominion of such powers, as is indeed to be inferred from the
very facts in the case of that witch. Hence also God by His Son
teaches <span id="fr_2353"></span>[2354](#fn_2353) us for whose sake
these things seem to have been done, always to strive earnestly, and at
death to pray that our souls may not fall into the hands of any such
power. For when Christ was giving up His spirit on the cross, He said,
‘Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit,’ <span
id="fr_2354"></span>[2355](#fn_2354) as I have learned also from the
memoirs. For He exhorted His disciples to surpass the pharisaic way of
living, with the warning, that if they did not, they might be sure they
could not be saved; and these words are recorded in the memoirs: ‘Unless
your righteousness exceed that of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall
not enter into the kingdom of heaven.’ <span
