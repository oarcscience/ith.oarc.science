<p> <a name="ix.vi.xxiv"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="ix.vi.xxiv-p0.1"></A>Chapter XXIII.&#8212;The patriarchs and prophets by pointing out the advent of Christ, fortified thereby, as it were, the way of posterity to the faith of Christ; and so the labours of the apostles were lessened inasmuch as they gathered in the fruits of the labours of others.</h3>  
<p><a name="ix.vi.xxiv-p1"></A>1. <a name="ix.vi.xxiv-p1.1"></A>For which reason the Lord declared to the disciples: &#8220;Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look upon the districts (<i>regiones</i>), for they are white [already] to harvest. For the harvest-man receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal, that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. For in this is the saying true, that one soweth and another reapeth. For I have sent you forward to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour; other men have laboured, and ye have entered into their labours.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4130"></A><A HREF="#fn_4130"><FONT SIZE="1">4131</FONT></A>
 Who, then, are they that have laboured, and have helped forward the dispensations of God? <a name="ix.vi.xxiv-p2.2"></A>It is clear that they are the patriarchs and prophets, who even prefigured our faith, and disseminated through the earth the advent of the Son of God, who and what He should be: so that posterity, possessing the fear of God, might easily accept the advent of Christ, having been instructed by the prophets. And for this reason it was, that when Joseph became aware that Mary was with child, and was minded to put her away privily, the angel said to him in sleep: &#8220;Fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. For she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their sins.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4131"></A><A HREF="#fn_4131"><FONT SIZE="1">4132</FONT></A>
 And exhorting him [to this], he added: &#8220;Now all this has been done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and His name shall be called Emmanuel;&#8221; thus influencing him by the words of the prophet, and warding off blame from Mary, pointing out that it was she who was the virgin mentioned by Isaiah beforehand, who should give birth to Emmanuel. Wherefore, when Joseph was convinced beyond all doubt, he both did take Mary, and joyfully yielded obedience in regard to all the rest of the education of Christ, undertaking a journey into Egypt and back again, and then a removal to Nazareth. [For this reason,] those who knew not the Scriptures nor the promise of God, nor the dispensation of Christ, at last called him the father of the child. For this reason, too, did the Lord Himself read at Capernaum the prophecies of Isaiah:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4132"></A><A HREF="#fn_4132"><FONT SIZE="1">4133</FONT></A>
 &#8220;The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me; to preach the Gospel to the poor hath He sent Me, to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and sight to the blind.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4133"></A><A HREF="#fn_4133"><FONT SIZE="1">4134</FONT></A>
 At the same time, showing that it was He Himself who had been foretold by Esaias the prophet, He said to them: &#8220;This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="ix.vi.xxiv-p6"></A>2. For this reason, also, Philip, when he had discovered the eunuch of the Ethiopians&#146; queen reading these words which had been written: &#8220;He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb is dumb before the shearer, so He opened not His mouth: in His humiliation His judgment was taken away;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4134"></A><A HREF="#fn_4134"><FONT SIZE="1">4135</FONT></A>
 and all the rest which the prophet proceeded to relate in regard  <A NAME="page_495"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 495</FONT></A> <a name="ix.vi.xxiv-Page_495"></A>  to His passion and His coming in the flesh, and how He was dishonoured by those who did not believe Him; easily persuaded him to believe on Him, that He was Christ Jesus, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and suffered whatsoever the prophet had predicted, and that He was the Son of God, who gives eternal life to men. And immediately when [Philip] had baptized him, he departed from him. For nothing else [but baptism] was wanting to him who had been already instructed by the prophets: he was not ignorant of God the Father, nor of the rules as to the [proper] manner of life, but was merely ignorant of the advent of the Son of God, which, when he had become acquainted with, in a short space of time, he went on his way rejoicing, to be the herald in Ethiopia of Christ&#146;s advent. Therefore Philip had no great labour to go through with regard to this man, because he was already prepared in the fear of God by the prophets. For this reason, too, did the apostles, collecting the sheep which had perished of the house of Israel, and discoursing to them from the Scriptures, prove that this crucified Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God; and they persuaded a great multitude, who, however, [already] possessed the fear of God. And there were, in one day, baptized three, and four, and five thousand men.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4135"></A><A HREF="#fn_4135"><FONT SIZE="1">4136</FONT></A>
