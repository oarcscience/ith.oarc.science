### <span id="vi.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—The fasts of the Jews are not true fasts, nor acceptable to God.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>He says
then to them again concerning these things, “Why do ye fast to Me as on
this day, saith the Lord, that your voice should be heard with a cry? I
have not chosen this fast, saith the Lord, that a man should humble his
soul. Nor, though ye bend your neck like a ring, and put upon you
sackcloth and ashes, will ye call it an acceptable fast.” <span
id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463) To us He saith, “Behold, this is
the fast that I have chosen, saith the Lord, not that a man should
humble his soul, but that he should loose every band of iniquity, untie
the fastenings of harsh agreements, restore to liberty them that are
bruised, tear in pieces every unjust engagement, feed the hungry with
thy bread, clothe the naked when thou seest him, bring the homeless into
thy house, not despise the humble if thou behold him, and not \[turn
away\] from the members of thine own family. Then shall thy dawn break
forth, and thy healing shall quickly spring up, and righteousness shall
go forth before thee, and the glory of God shall encompass thee; and
then thou shalt call, and God shall hear thee; whilst thou art yet
speaking, He shall say, Behold, I am with thee; if thou take away from
thee the chain \[binding others\], and the stretching forth of the
hands <span id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464) \[to swear falsely\],
and words of murmuring, and give cheerfully thy bread to the hungry, and
show compassion to the soul that has been humbled.” <span
id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465) To this end, therefore, brethren,
He is long-suffering, foreseeing how the people whom He has prepared
shall with guilelessness believe in His Beloved. For He revealed all
these things to us beforehand, that we should not rush forward as rash
acceptors of their laws. <span id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466)

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p3"></span> The original here is <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.iii-p3.1"></span>χειροτονίαν</span>, from
the LXX. Hefele remarks, that it may refer to the stretching forth of
the hands, either to swear falsely, or to mock and insult one’s
neighbour.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p5"></span> The Greek is here unintelligible: the
Latin has, “that we should not rush on, as if proselytes to their law.”
