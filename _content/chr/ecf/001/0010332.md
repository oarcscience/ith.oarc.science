### <span id="v.xxv.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Ignatius is devoured by the beasts at Rome.

<span id="v.xxv.vi-p1"></span><span id="v.xxv.vi-p1.1"></span>They
pushed forth therefore from the place which is called Portus; <span
id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424) and (the <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425) fame of all relating to the holy
martyr being already spread <span id="page_131">p. 131</span> <span
id="v.xxv.vi-Page_131"></span> abroad) we met the brethren full of fear
and joy; rejoicing indeed because they were thought worthy to meet with
Theophorus, but struck with fear because so eminent a man was being led
to death. Now he enjoined some to keep silence who, in their fervent
zeal, were saying <span id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426) that they
would appease the people, so that they should not demand the destruction
of this just one. He being immediately aware of this through the
Spirit, <span id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427) and having saluted
them all, and begged of them to show a true affection towards him, and
having dwelt \[on this point\] at greater length than in his
Epistle, <span id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428) and having persuaded
them not to envy him hastening to the Lord, he then, after he had, with
all the brethren kneeling \[beside him\], entreated the Son of God in
behalf of the Churches, that a stop might be put to the persecution, and
that mutual love might continue among the brethren, was led with all
haste into the amphitheatre. Then, being immediately thrown in,
according to the command of Cæsar given some time ago, the public
spectacles being just about to close (for it was then a solemn day, as
they deemed it, being that which is called the thirteenth <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429) in the Roman tongue, on which the
people were wont to assemble in more than ordinary numbers <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430) ), he was thus cast to the wild
beasts close beside the temple, <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431) that so by them the desire of the
holy martyr Ignatius should be fulfilled, according to that which is
written, “The desire of the righteous is acceptable <span
id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432) \[to God\],” to the effect that he
might not be troublesome to any of the brethren by the gathering of his
remains, even as he had in his Epistle expressed a wish beforehand that
so his end might be. For only the harder portions of his holy remains
were left, which were conveyed to Antioch and wrapped <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433) in linen, as an inestimable
treasure left to the holy Church by the grace which was in the martyr.
