### <span id="viii.vi.xxxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—Whence men attributed to God human form.

if any person investigates the subject of images, and inquires on what
ground those who first fashioned your gods conceived that they had the
forms of men, he will find that this also was derived from the divine
history. For seeing that Moses history, speaking in the person of God,
says, “Let Us make man in our image and likeness,” these persons, under
the impression that this meant that men were like God in form, began
thus to fashion their gods, supposing they would make a likeness from a
likeness. But why, ye men of Greece, am I now induced to recount these
things? That ye may know that it is not possible to learn the true
religion from those who were unable, even on those subjects by which
they won the admiration of the heathen, <span
id="fr_2583"></span>[2584](#fn_2583) to write anything original, but
merely propounded by some allegorical device in their own writings what
they had learned from Moses and the other prophets.
