<span id="ix.viii.l-p1"></span>For <span
id="fr_4899"></span>[4900](#fn_4899) then there shall in truth be a
common joy consummated to all those who believe unto life, and in each
individual shall be confirmed the mystery of the Resurrection, and the
hope of incorruption, and the commencement of the eternal kingdom, when
God shall have destroyed death and the devil. For that human nature and
flesh which has risen again from the dead shall die no more; but after
it had been changed to incorruption, and made like to spirit, when the
heaven was opened, \[our Lord\] full of glory offered it (the flesh) to
the Father.

<span id="ix.viii.l-p2"></span> This extract is introduced as follows:
“For Irenæus Bishop of Lyons, who was a contemporary of the disciple of
the apostle, Polycarp Bishop of Smyrna, and martyr, and for this reason
is held in just estimation, wrote to an Alexandrian to the effect that
it is right, with respect to the feast of the Resurrection, that we
should celebrate it upon the first day of the week.” This shows us that
the extract must have been taken from the work *Against Schism*
addressed to Blastus.
