And when any one of the saints shall lay hold of a cluster, another shall cry out, &#145;I am a better cluster, take me; bless the Lord through me.&#146; In like manner, [He said] that a grain of wheat would  <A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A> <a name="vii.ii.iv-Page_154"></A>  produce ten thousand ears, and that every ear would have ten thousand grains, and every grain would yield ten pounds of clear, pure, fine flour; and that apples, and seeds, and grass would produce in similar proportions; and that all animals, feeding then only on the productions of the earth, would become peaceable and harmonious, and be in perfect subjection to man.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1745"></A><A HREF="#fn_1745"><FONT SIZE="1">1746</FONT></A>
 [Testimony is borne to these things in writing by Papias, an ancient man, who was a hearer of John and a friend of Polycarp, in the fourth of his books; for five books were composed by him. And he added, saying, &#8220;Now these things are credible to believers. <a name="vii.ii.iv-p3.1"></A>And Judas the traitor,&#8221; says he, &#8220;not believing, and asking, &#145;How shall such growths be accomplished by the Lord?&#146; the Lord said, &#145;They shall see who shall come to them.&#146; These, then, are the times mentioned by the prophet Isaiah: &#145;And the wolf shall lie, down with the lamb,&#146; etc. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006">Isa. xi. 6</a><a name="vii.ii.iv-p3.2"></A> ff.).&#8221;]</p>
