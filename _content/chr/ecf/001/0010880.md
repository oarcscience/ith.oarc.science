<span id="ix.viii.v-p1"></span>The <span
id="fr_4808"></span>[4809](#fn_4808) will and the energy of God is the
effective and foreseeing cause of every time and place and age, and of
every nature. The will is the reason (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.viii.v-p2.1"></span>λόγος</span>) of the intellectual soul, which
\[reason\] is within us, inasmuch as it is the faculty belonging to it
which is endowed with freedom of action. The will is the mind desiring
\[some object\], and an appetite possessed of intelligence, yearning
after that thing which is desired.

<span id="ix.viii.v-p2"></span> Also quoted by Maximus Turinensis, *Op.*
ii. 152, who refers it to Irenæus’s *Sermo de Fide*, which work, not
being referred to by Eusebius or Jerome, causes Massuet to doubt the
authenticity of the fragment. Harvey, however, accepts it.
