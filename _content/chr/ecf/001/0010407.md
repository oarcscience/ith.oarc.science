hear what part of earth He was to be born in, as another prophet, Micah,
foretold. He spoke thus: “And thou, Bethlehem, the land of Judah, art
not the least among the princes of Judah; for out of thee shall come
forth a Governor, who shall feed My people.” <span

of the Jews, thirty-five stadia from Jerusalem, in which Jesus Christ
was born, as you can ascertain also from the registers of the taxing
made under Cyrenius, your first procurator in Judæa.
