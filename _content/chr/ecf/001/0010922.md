### <span id="ix.viii.xlvii-p0.1"></span>XLVII.

<span id="ix.viii.xlvii-p1"></span>The <span
id="fr_4893"></span>[4894](#fn_4893) birth of John \[the Baptist\]
brought the dumbness of Zacharias to an end. For he did not burden his
father, when the voice issued forth from silence; but as when not
believed it rendered him tongue-tied, so did the voice sounding out
clearly set his father free, to whom he had both been announced and
born. Now the voice and the burning light <span
id="fr_4894"></span>[4895](#fn_4894) were a precursor of the Word and
the Light.
