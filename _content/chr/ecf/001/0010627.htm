For as Orpheus in the beginning of his poem had said, &#8220;O goddess, sing the wrath of Demeter, who brings the goodly fruit,&#8221; Homer began thus, &#8220;O goddess, sing the wrath of Achilles, son of Peleus,&#8221; preferring, as it seems to me, even to violate the poetical metre in his first line, than that he should seem not to have remembered before all else the names of the gods.

 he makes Ulysses address the host of the Greeks thus: &#8220;The rule of many is not a good thing; let there be one ruler.&#8221; And that the rule of many is not a good thing, but on the contrary an evil, he proposed to evince by fact, recounting the wars which took place on account of the multitude of rulers, and the fights and factions, and their mutual counterplots. For monarchy <i>is</i> free from contention. So far the poet Homer.</p>
