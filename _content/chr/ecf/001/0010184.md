### <span id="v.v.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Be ye favourable to me.

<span id="v.v.viii-p1"></span>I no longer wish to live after the manner
of men, and my desire shall be fulfilled if ye consent. Be ye willing,
then, that ye also may have your desires fulfilled. I entreat you in
this brief letter; do ye give credit to me. Jesus Christ will reveal
these things to you, \[so that ye shall know\] that I speak truly.
He <span id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870) is the mouth altogether free
from falsehood, by which the Father has truly spoken. <span
id="v.v.viii-p2.1"></span>Pray ye for me, that I may attain \[the object
of my desire\]. I have not written to you according to the flesh, but
according to the will of God. If I shall suffer, ye have wished \[well\]
to me; but if I am rejected, ye have hated me.

<span id="v.v.viii-p3"></span>I no longer wish to live after the manner
of men, and my desire shall be fulfilled if ye consent. “I am crucified
with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet no longer I, since Christ liveth
in me.” <span id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871) I entreat you in this
brief letter: do not refuse me; believe me that I love Jesus, who was
delivered \[to death\] for my sake. “What shall I render to the Lord for
all His benefits towards me?” <span id="fr_872"></span>[873](#fn_872)
Now God, even the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, shall reveal these
things to you, \[so that ye shall know\] that I speak truly. <span
id="v.v.viii-p5.2"></span>And do ye pray along with me, that I may
attain my aim in the Holy Spirit. I have not written to you according to
the flesh, but according to the will of God. If I shall suffer, ye have
loved me; but if I am rejected, ye have hated me.
