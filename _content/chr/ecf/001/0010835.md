### <span id="ix.vi.xli-p0.1"></span>Chapter XL.—One and the same God the Father inflicts punishment on the reprobate, and bestows rewards on the elect.

<span id="ix.vi.xli-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.xli-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.vi.xli-p1.2"></span>It is therefore one and the same God the
Father who has prepared good things with Himself for those who desire
His fellowship, and who remain in subjection to Him; and who has the
eternal fire for the ringleader of the apostasy, the devil, and those
who revolted with him, into which \[fire\] the Lord <span
id="fr_4424"></span>[4425](#fn_4424) has declared those men shall be
sent who have been set apart by themselves on His left hand. And this is
what has been spoken by the prophet, “I am a jealous God, making peace,
and creating evil things;” <span id="fr_4425"></span>[4426](#fn_4425)
thus making peace and friendship with those who repent and turn to Him,
and bringing \[them to\] unity, but preparing for the impenitent, those
who shun the light, eternal fire and outer darkness, which are evils
indeed to those persons who fall into them.

<span id="ix.vi.xli-p4"></span> <span id="page_524">p. 524</span> <span
id="ix.vi.xli-Page_524"></span> 2. If, however, it were truly one Father
who confers rest, and another God who has prepared the fire, their sons
would have been equally different \[one from the other\]; one, indeed,
sending \[men\] into the Father’s kingdom, but the other into eternal
fire. But inasmuch as one and the same Lord has pointed out that the
whole human race shall be divided at the judgment, “as a shepherd
divideth the sheep from the goats,” <span
id="fr_4426"></span>[4427](#fn_4426) and that to some He will say,
“Come, ye blessed of My Father, receive the kingdom which has been
prepared for you,” <span id="fr_4427"></span>[4428](#fn_4427) but to
others, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, which My
Father has prepared for the devil and his angels,” <span
id="fr_4428"></span>[4429](#fn_4428) one and the same Father is
manifestly declared \[in this passage\], “making peace and creating evil
things,” preparing fit things for both; as also there is one Judge
sending both into a fit place, as the Lord sets forth in the parable of
the tares and the wheat, where He says, “As therefore the tares are
gathered together, and burned in the fire, so shall it be at the end of
the world. The Son of man shall send His angels, and they shall gather
from His kingdom everything that offendeth, and those who work iniquity,
and shall send them into a furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth. Then shall the just shine forth as the sun in the
kingdom of their Father.” <span id="fr_4429"></span>[4430](#fn_4429) The
Father, therefore, who has prepared the kingdom for the righteous, into
which the Son has received those worthy of it, is He who has also
prepared the furnace of fire, into which these angels commissioned by
the Son of man shall send those persons who deserve it, according to
God’s command.

<span id="ix.vi.xli-p9"></span>3. The Lord, indeed, sowed good seed in
His own field; <span id="fr_4430"></span>[4431](#fn_4430) and He says,
“The field is the world.” But while men slept, the enemy came, and
“sowed tares in the midst of the wheat, and went his way.” <span
id="fr_4431"></span>[4432](#fn_4431) Hence we learn that this was the
apostate angel and the enemy, because he was envious of God’s
workmanship, and took in hand to render this \[workmanship\] an enmity
with God. For this cause also God has banished from His presence him who
did of his own accord stealthily sow the tares, that is, him who brought
about the transgression; <span id="fr_4432"></span>[4433](#fn_4432) but
He took compassion upon man, who, through want of care no doubt, but
still wickedly \[on the part of another\], became involved in
disobedience; and He turned the enmity by which \[the devil\] had
designed to make \[man\] the enemy of God, against the author of it, by
removing His own anger from man, turning it in another direction, and
sending it instead upon the serpent. As also the Scripture tells us that
God said to the serpent, “And I will place enmity between thee and the
woman, and between thy seed and her seed. He <span
id="fr_4433"></span>[4434](#fn_4433) shall bruise thy head, and thou
shall bruise his heel.” <span id="fr_4434"></span>[4435](#fn_4434) And
the Lord summed up in Himself this enmity, when He was made man from a
woman, and trod upon his \[the serpent’s\] head, as I have pointed out
in the preceding book.

this (the Greek of which was recovered by Grabe from two ancient *Catenæ

he had himself introduced*, making the explanatory words to refer to the
*tares*, and not, as in the Greek, to the *sower of the tares*.
