### <span id="viii.iv.xxxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.—The Jews hate the Christians who believe this. How great the distinction is between both!

<span id="viii.iv.xxxix-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxxix-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xxxix-p1.2"></span>“Now
it is not surprising,” I continued, “that you hate us who hold these
opinions, and convict you of a continual hardness of heart. <span
id="fr_2047"></span>[2048](#fn_2047) For indeed Elijah, conversing with
God concerning you, speaks thus: ‘Lord, they have slain Thy prophets,
and digged down Thine altars: and I am left alone, and they seek my
life.’ And He answers him: ‘I have still seven thousand men who have not
bowed the knee to Baal.’ <span id="fr_2048"></span>[2049](#fn_2048)
Therefore, just as God did not inflict His anger on account of those
seven thousand men, even so He has now neither yet inflicted judgment,
nor does inflict it, knowing that daily some \[of you\] are becoming
disciples in the name of Christ, and quitting the path of error; who are
also receiving gifts, each as he is worthy, illumined through the name
of this Christ. For one receives the spirit of understanding, another of
counsel, another of strength, another of healing, another of
foreknowledge, another of teaching, and another of the fear of God.”

<span id="viii.iv.xxxix-p4"></span>To this Trypho said to me, “I wish
you knew that you are beside yourself, talking these sentiments.”

<span id="viii.iv.xxxix-p5"></span>And I said to him, “Listen, O
friend, <span id="fr_2049"></span>[2050](#fn_2049) for I am not mad or
beside myself; but it was prophesied that, after the ascent of Christ to
heaven, He would deliver <span id="fr_2050"></span>[2051](#fn_2050) us
from error and give us gifts. The words are these: ‘He ascended up on
high; He led captivity captive; He gave gifts to men.’ <span
id="fr_2051"></span>[2052](#fn_2051) Accordingly, we who have received
gifts from Christ, who has ascended up on high, prove from the words of
prophecy that you, ‘the wise in yourselves, and the men of understanding
in your own eyes,’ <span id="fr_2052"></span>[2053](#fn_2052) are
foolish, and honour God and His Christ by lip only. But we, who are
instructed in the whole truth, <span
id="fr_2053"></span>[2054](#fn_2053) honour Them both in acts, and in
knowledge, and in heart, even unto death. But you hesitate to confess
that He is Christ, as the Scriptures and the events witnessed and done
in His name prove, perhaps for this reason, lest you be persecuted by
the rulers, who, under the influence of the wicked and deceitful spirit,
the serpent, will not cease putting to death and persecuting those who
confess the name of Christ until He come again, and destroy them all,
and render to each his deserts.”

<span id="viii.iv.xxxix-p11"></span>And Trypho replied, “Now, then,
render us the proof that this man who you say was crucified and ascended
into heaven is the Christ of God. For you have sufficiently proved by
means of the Scriptures previously quoted by you, that it is declared in
the Scriptures that Christ must suffer, and come again with glory, and
receive the eternal kingdom over all the nations, every kingdom being
made subject to Him: now show us that this man is He.”

<span id="viii.iv.xxxix-p12"></span>And I replied, “It has been already
proved, sirs, to those who have ears, even from the facts which have
been conceded by you; but that you may not think me at a loss, and
unable to give proof of what you ask, as I promised, I shall do so at a
fitting place. At present, I resume the consideration of the subject
which I was discussing.
