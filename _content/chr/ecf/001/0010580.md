### <span id="viii.iv.cxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXIX.—Christians are the holy people promised to Abraham. They have been called like Abraham.

<span id="viii.iv.cxix-p1"></span>Then I said again, “Would you suppose,
sirs, that we could ever have understood these matters in the
Scriptures, if we had not received grace to discern by the will of Him
whose pleasure it was? in order that the saying of Moses <span
id="fr_2399"></span>[2400](#fn_2399) might come to pass, ‘They provoked
me with strange \[gods\], they provoked me to anger with their
abominations. They sacrificed to demons whom they knew not; new gods
that came newly up, whom their fathers knew not. Thou hast forsaken God
that begat thee, and forgotten God that brought thee up. And the Lord
saw, and was jealous, and was provoked to anger by reason of the rage of
His sons and daughters: and He said, I will turn My face away from them,
and I will show what shall come on them at the last; for it is a very
froward generation, children in whom is no faith. They have moved Me to
jealousy with that which is not God, they have provoked Me to anger with
their idols; and I will move them to jealousy with that which is not a
nation, I will provoke them to anger with a foolish people. For a fire
is kindled from Mine anger, and it shall burn to Hades. It shall consume
the earth and her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the
mountains; I will heap mischief on them.’ <span
id="fr_2400"></span>[2401](#fn_2400) And after that Righteous One was
put to death, we flourished as another people, and shot forth as new and
prosperous corn; as the prophets said, ‘And many nations shall betake
themselves to the Lord in that day for a people: and they shall dwell in
the midst of all the earth.’ <span id="fr_2401"></span>[2402](#fn_2401)
But we are not <span id="page_259">p. 259</span> <span
id="viii.iv.cxix-Page_259"></span> only a people, but also a holy
people, as we have shown already. <span
id="fr_2402"></span>[2403](#fn_2402) ‘And they shall call them the holy
people, redeemed by the Lord.’ <span
id="fr_2403"></span>[2404](#fn_2403) Therefore we are not a people to be
despised, nor a barbarous race, nor such as the Carian and Phrygian
nations; but God has even chosen us and He has become manifest to those
who asked not after Him. ‘Behold, I am God,’ He says, ‘to the nation
which called not on My name.’ <span id="fr_2404"></span>[2405](#fn_2404)
For this is that nation which God of old promised to Abraham, when He
declared that He would make him a father of many nations; not meaning,
however, the Arabians, or Egyptians, or Idumæans, since Ishmael became
the father of a mighty nation, and so did Esau; and there is now a great
multitude of Ammonites. Noah, moreover, was the father of Abraham, and
in fact of all men; and others were the progenitors of others. What
larger measure of grace, then, did Christ bestow on Abraham? This,
namely, that He called him with His voice by the like calling, telling
him to quit the land wherein he dwelt. <span
id="viii.iv.cxix-p7.2"></span>And He has called all of us by that voice,
and we have left already the way of living in which we used to spend our
days, passing our time in evil after the fashions of the other
inhabitants of the earth; and along with Abraham we shall inherit the
holy land, when we shall receive the inheritance for an endless
eternity, being children of Abraham through the like faith. For as he
believed the voice of God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness,
in like manner we having believed God’s voice spoken by the apostles of
Christ, and promulgated to us by the prophets, have renounced even to
death all the things of the world. Accordingly, He promises to him a
nation of similar faith, God-fearing, righteous, and delighting the
Father; but it is not you, ‘in whom is no faith.’
