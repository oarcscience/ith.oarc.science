### <span id="viii.iv.cxxxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXXVII.—He exhorts the Jews to be converted.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxxvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxxvii-p1.1"></span>“Say no evil thing, my brothers,
against Him that was crucified, and treat not scornfully the stripes
wherewith all may be healed, even as we are healed. For it will be well
if, persuaded by the Scriptures, you are circumcised from
hard-heartedness: not that circumcision which you have from the tenets
that are put into you; for that was given for a sign, and not for a work
of righteousness, as the Scriptures compel you \[to admit\]. Assent,
therefore, and pour no ridicule on the Son of God; obey not the
Pharisaic teachers, and scoff not at the King of Israel, as the rulers
of your synagogues teach you to do after your prayers: for if he that
touches those who are not pleasing <span
id="fr_2475"></span>[2476](#fn_2475) to God, is as one that touches the
apple of God’s eye, how much more so is he that touches His beloved! And
that this is He, has been sufficiently demonstrated.”

<span id="viii.iv.cxxxvii-p3"></span>And as they kept silence, I
continued: “My friends, I now refer to the Scriptures as the Seventy
have interpreted them; for when I quoted them formerly as you possess
them, I made proof of you \[to ascertain\] how you were disposed. <span
id="fr_2476"></span>[2477](#fn_2476) For, mentioning the Scripture which
says, ‘Woe unto them! for they have devised evil counsel against
themselves, saying’ <span id="fr_2477"></span>[2478](#fn_2477) (as the
Seventy have translated, I continued): ‘Let us take away the righteous,
for he is distasteful to us;’ whereas at the commencement of the
discussion I added what your version has: ‘Let us bind the righteous,
for he is distasteful to us.’ But you had been busy about some other
matter, and seem to have listened to the words without attending to
them. But now, since the day is drawing to a close, for the sun is about
to set, I shall add one remark to what I have said, and conclude. I have
indeed made the very same remark already, but I think it would be right
to bestow some consideration on it again.
