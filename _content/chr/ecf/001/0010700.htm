<p><a name="ix.ii.iv-p1"></A>1. <a name="ix.ii.iv-p1.1"></A><a name="ix.ii.iv-p1.2"></A>Such, then, is the account they give of what took place within the Pleroma; such the calamities that flowed from the passion which seized upon the &AElig;on who has been named, and who was within a little of perishing by being absorbed in the universal substance, through her inquisitive searching after the Father; such the consolidation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2680"></A><A HREF="#fn_2680"><FONT SIZE="1">2681</FONT></A>
 [of that &AElig;on] from her condition of agony by <a name="ix.ii.iv-p2.2"></A><a name="ix.ii.iv-p2.3"></A>Horos, and Stauros, and Lytrotes, and Carpistes, and Horothetes, and Metagoges.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2681"></A><A HREF="#fn_2681"><FONT SIZE="1">2682</FONT></A>
 <a name="ix.ii.iv-p3.3"></A>Such also is the account of the generation of the later &AElig;ons, namely of the first Christ and of the Holy Spirit, both of whom were produced by the Father after the repentance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2682"></A><A HREF="#fn_2682"><FONT SIZE="1">2683</FONT></A>
 [of Sophia], and of the second&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2683"></A><A HREF="#fn_2683"><FONT SIZE="1">2684</FONT></A>
 Christ (whom they also style Saviour), who owed his being to the joint contributions [of the &AElig;ons]. <a name="ix.ii.iv-p5.1"></A>They tell us, however, that this knowledge has not been openly divulged, because all are not capable of receiving it, but has been mystically revealed by the Saviour through means of parables to those qualified for understanding it. This has been done as follows. The thirty &AElig;ons are indicated (as we have already remarked) by the thirty years during which they say the Saviour performed no public act, and by the parable of the labourers in the vineyard. Paul also, they affirm, very clearly and frequently names these &AElig;ons, and even goes so far as to preserve their order, when he says, &#8220;To all the generations of the &AElig;ons of the &AElig;on.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2684"></A><A HREF="#fn_2684"><FONT SIZE="1">2685</FONT></A>
 Nay, we ourselves, when at the giving&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2685"></A><A HREF="#fn_2685"><FONT SIZE="1">2686</FONT></A>
 of thanks we pronounce the words, &#8220;To &AElig;ons of &AElig;ons&#8221; (for ever and ever), do set forth these &AElig;ons. And, in fine, wherever the words &AElig;on or &AElig;ons occur, they at once refer them to these beings.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.iv-p8"></A>2. <a name="ix.ii.iv-p8.1"></A>The production, again, of the Duodecad of the &AElig;ons, is indicated by the fact that the Lord was <i>twelve</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2686"></A><A HREF="#fn_2686"><FONT SIZE="1">2687</FONT></A>
 years of age when He disputed with the teachers of the law, and by the election of the apostles, for of these there were twelve.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2687"></A><A HREF="#fn_2687"><FONT SIZE="1">2688</FONT></A>
 The other eighteen &AElig;ons are made manifest in this way: that the Lord, [according to them,] conversed with His disciples for eighteen months&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2688"></A><A HREF="#fn_2688"><FONT SIZE="1">2689</FONT></A>
 after His resurrection from the dead. <a name="ix.ii.iv-p11.2"></A>They also affirm that these eighteen &AElig;ons are strikingly indicated by the first two letters of His name [<span class="Greek"><a name="ix.ii.iv-p11.3"></A>&#8125;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>], namely <i>Iota</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2689"></A><A HREF="#fn_2689"><FONT SIZE="1">2690</FONT></A>
 and <i>Eta</i>. And, in like manner, they assert that the ten &AElig;ons are pointed out by the letter <i>Iota</i>, which begins His name; while, for the same reason, they tell us the Saviour said, &#8220;One <i>Iota</i>, or one tittle, shall by no means pass away until all be fulfilled.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2690"></A><A HREF="#fn_2690"><FONT SIZE="1">2691</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.iv-p14"></A>3. <a name="ix.ii.iv-p14.1"></A><a name="ix.ii.iv-p14.2"></A>They further maintain that the passion which took place in the case of the twelfth &AElig;on is pointed at by the apostasy of Judas, who was the twelfth apostle, and also by the fact that Christ suffered in the twelfth month. For their opinion is, that He continued to preach for one year only after His baptism. The same thing is also most clearly indicated by the case of the woman who suffered from an issue of blood. For after she had been thus afflicted during twelve years, she was healed by the advent of the Saviour, when she had touched the border of His garment; and on this account the Saviour said, &#8220;Who touched me?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2691"></A><A HREF="#fn_2691"><FONT SIZE="1">2692</FONT></A>
&#8212;teaching his disciples the mystery which had occurred among the &AElig;ons, and the healing of that &AElig;on who had been involved in suffering. For she who had been afflicted twelve years represented that power whose essence, as they narrate, was stretching itself forth, and flowing into immensity; and unless she had touched the garment of the Son,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2692"></A><A HREF="#fn_2692"><FONT SIZE="1">2693</FONT></A>
 that is, Aletheia of the first Tetrad, who is denoted by the hem spoken of, she would have been dissolved into the general essence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2693"></A><A HREF="#fn_2693"><FONT SIZE="1">2694</FONT></A>
 [of which she participated]. She stopped short, however, and ceased any longer to suffer. For the power that went forth from the Son (and this power they term Horos) healed her, and separated the passion from her.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.iv-p18"></A>4. They moreover affirm that the Saviour&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2694"></A><A HREF="#fn_2694"><FONT SIZE="1">2695</FONT></A>
 is shown to be derived from all the &AElig;ons, and to be in Himself <i>everything</i> by the following passage: &#8220;Every male that openeth the womb.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2695"></A><A HREF="#fn_2695"><FONT SIZE="1">2696</FONT></A>
 For He, being everything, opened the womb&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2696"></A><A HREF="#fn_2696"><FONT SIZE="1">2697</FONT></A>
 of the enthymesis of the suffering &AElig;on, when  <A NAME="page_320"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 320</FONT></A> <a name="ix.ii.iv-Page_320"></A>  it had been expelled from the Pleroma. This they also style the second Ogdoad, of which we shall speak presently. And they state that it was clearly on this account that Paul said, &#8220;And He Himself is all things;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2697"></A><A HREF="#fn_2697"><FONT SIZE="1">2698</FONT></A>
 and again, &#8220;All things are to Him, and of Him are all things;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2698"></A><A HREF="#fn_2698"><FONT SIZE="1">2699</FONT></A>
 and further, &#8220;In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2699"></A><A HREF="#fn_2699"><FONT SIZE="1">2700</FONT></A>
 and yet again, &#8220;All things are gathered together by God in Christ.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2700"></A><A HREF="#fn_2700"><FONT SIZE="1">2701</FONT></A>
 Thus do they interpret these and any like passages to be found in Scripture.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.iv-p26"></A>5. They show, further, that that Horos of theirs, whom they call by a variety of names, has two faculties,&#8212;the one of supporting, and the other of separating; and in so far as he supports and sustains, he is Stauros, while in so far as he divides and separates, he is Horos. They then represent the Saviour as having indicated this twofold faculty: first, the sustaining power, when He said, &#8220;Whosoever doth not bear his cross (Stauros), and follow after me, cannot be my disciple;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2701"></A><A HREF="#fn_2701"><FONT SIZE="1">2702</FONT></A>
 and again, &#8220;Taking up the cross, follow me;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2702"></A><A HREF="#fn_2702"><FONT SIZE="1">2703</FONT></A>
 but the separating power when He said, &#8220;I came not to send peace, but a sword.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2703"></A><A HREF="#fn_2703"><FONT SIZE="1">2704</FONT></A>
 They also maintain that John indicated the same thing when he said, &#8220;The fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge the floor, and will gather the wheat into His garner; but the chaff He will burn with fire unquenchable.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2704"></A><A HREF="#fn_2704"><FONT SIZE="1">2705</FONT></A>
 By this declaration He set forth the faculty of Horos. For that fan they explain to be the cross (Stauros), which consumes, no doubt, all material&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2705"></A><A HREF="#fn_2705"><FONT SIZE="1">2706</FONT></A>
 objects, as fire does chaff, but it purifies all them that are saved, as a fan does wheat. Moreover, they affirm that the Apostle Paul himself made mention of this cross in the following words: &#8220;The doctrine of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to us who are saved it is the power of God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2706"></A><A HREF="#fn_2706"><FONT SIZE="1">2707</FONT></A>
 And again: &#8220;God forbid that I should glory in anything&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2707"></A><A HREF="#fn_2707"><FONT SIZE="1">2708</FONT></A>
 save in the cross of Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I unto the world.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.iv-p34"></A>6. <a name="ix.ii.iv-p34.1"></A>Such, then, is the account which they all give of their Pleroma, and of the formation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2708"></A><A HREF="#fn_2708"><FONT SIZE="1">2709</FONT></A>
 of the universe, striving, as they do, to adapt the good words of revelation to their own wicked inventions. And it is not only from the writings of the evangelists and the apostles that they endeavour to derive proofs for their opinions by means of perverse interpretations and deceitful expositions: they deal in the same way with the law and the prophets, which contain many parables and allegories that can frequently be drawn into various senses, according to the kind of exegesis to which they are subjected. And others&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2709"></A><A HREF="#fn_2709"><FONT SIZE="1">2710</FONT></A>
 of them, with great craftiness, adapted such parts of Scripture to their own figments, lead away captive from the truth those who do not retain a stedfast faith in one God, the Father Almighty, and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>

Harvey and others, however, deny that there is any necessity for supposing the Holy Eucharist to be referred to; the ancient Latin version translates in the plural, &#8220;in gratiarum actionibus.&#8221;</p>
