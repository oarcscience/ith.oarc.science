### <span id="viii.iii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Why the Christians do not kill themselves.

<span id="viii.iii.iv-p1"></span><span id="viii.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>But
lest some one say to us, “Go then all of you and kill yourselves, and
pass even now to God, and do not trouble us,” I will tell you why we do
not so, but why, when examined, we fearlessly confess. We have been
taught that God did not make the world aimlessly, but for the sake of
the human race; and we have before stated that He takes pleasure in
those who imitate His properties, and is displeased with those that
embrace what is worthless either in word or deed. If, then, we all kill
ourselves we shall become the cause, as far as in us lies, why no one
should be born, or instructed in the divine doctrines, or even why the
human race should not exist; and we shall, if we so act, be ourselves
acting in opposition to the will of God. But when we are examined, we
make no denial, because we are not conscious of any evil, but count it
impious not to speak the truth in all things, which also we know is
pleasing to God, and because <span id="page_190">p. 190</span> <span

deliver you from an unjust prejudice.
