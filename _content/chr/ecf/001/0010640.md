### <span id="viii.vi.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Homer’s knowledge of man’s origin.

<span id="viii.vi.xxx-p1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.xxx-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.vi.xxx-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.vi.xxx-p1.3"></span>And he was obviously deceived in the same
way regarding the earth and heaven and man; for he supposes that there
are “ideas” of these. For as Moses wrote thus, “In the beginning God
created the heaven and the earth,” and then subjoins this sentence, “And
the earth was invisible and unfashioned,” he thought that it was the
pre-existent earth which was spoken of in the words, “The earth was,”
because Moses said, “And the earth was invisible and unfashioned;” and
he thought that the earth, concerning which he says, “God created the
heaven and the earth,” was that earth which we perceive by the senses,
and which God made according to the pre-existent form. And so also, of
the heaven which was created, he thought that the heaven which was
created—and which he also called the firmament—was that creation which
the senses perceive; and that the heaven which the intellect perceives
is that other of which the prophet said, “The heaven of heavens is the
Lord’s, but the earth hath He given to the children of men.” <span
id="fr_2576"></span>[2577](#fn_2576) And so also concerning man: Moses
first mentions the name of man, and then after many other creations he
makes mention of the formation of man, saying, “And God made man, taking
dust from the earth.” <span id="fr_2577"></span>[2578](#fn_2577) He
thought, accordingly, that the man first so named existed before the man
who was made, and that he who was formed of the earth was afterwards
made according to the pre-existent form. And that man was formed of
earth, Homer, too, having discovered from the ancient and divine history
which says, “Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return,” <span
id="fr_2578"></span>[2579](#fn_2578) calls the lifeless body of Hector
dumb clay. For in condemnation of Achilles dragging the corpse of Hector
after death, he says somewhere: <span
id="fr_2579"></span>[2580](#fn_2579) —

> <span id="viii.vi.xxx-p5.1"></span>“On the dumb clay he cast
> indignity,  
> Blinded with rage.”  

<span id="viii.vi.xxx-p6"></span>And again, somewhere else, <span
id="fr_2580"></span>[2581](#fn_2580) he introduces Menelaus, thus
addressing those who were not accepting Hector’s challenge to single
combat with becoming alacrity,—

> <span id="viii.vi.xxx-p7.1"></span>“To earth and water may you all
> return,”—  

<span id="viii.vi.xxx-p8"></span>resolving them in his violent rage into
their original and pristine formation from earth. These things Homer and
Plato, having learned in Egypt from the ancient histories, wrote in
their own words.
