### <span id="viii.iv.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Christians would observe the law, if they did not know why it was instituted.

<span id="viii.iv.xviii-p1"></span>“For since you have read, O Trypho,
as you yourself admitted, the doctrines taught by our Saviour, I do not
think that I have done foolishly in adding some short utterances of His
to the prophetic statements. Wash therefore, and be now clean, and put
away iniquity from your souls, as God bids you be washed in this laver,
and be circumcised with the true circumcision. <span
id="viii.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xviii-p1.2"></span>For
we too would observe the fleshly circumcision, and the Sabbaths, and in
short all the feasts, if we did not know for what reason they were
enjoined you,—namely, on account of your transgressions and the hardness
of your hearts. For if we patiently endure all things contrived against
us by wicked men and demons, so that even amid cruelties unutterable,
death and torments, we pray for mercy to those who inflict such things
upon us, and do not wish to give the least retort to any one, even as
the new Lawgiver commanded us: how is it, Trypho, that we would not
observe those rites which do not harm us, —I speak of fleshly
circumcision, and Sabbaths, and feasts?
