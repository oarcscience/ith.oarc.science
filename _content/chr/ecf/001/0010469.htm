<p> <a name="viii.iv.viii"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.iv.viii-p0.1"></A>Chapter VIII.&#8212;Justin by his colloquy is kindled with love to Christ.</h3>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.viii-p1"></A>&#8220;When he had spoken these and many other things, which there is no time for mentioning at present, he went away, bidding me attend to them; and I have not seen him since. But straightway a flame was kindled in my soul; and a love of the prophets, and of those men who are friends of Christ, possessed me; and whilst revolving his words in my mind, I found this philosophy alone to be safe and profitable. Thus, and for this reason, I am a philosopher. Moreover, I would wish that all, making a resolution similar to my own, do not keep themselves away from the words of the Saviour. For they possess a terrible power in themselves, and are sufficient to inspire those who turn aside from the path of rectitude with awe; while the sweetest rest is afforded those who make a diligent practice of them. If, then, you have any concern for yourself, and if you are eagerly looking for salvation, and if you believe in God, you may&#8212;since you are not indifferent to the matter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1963"></A><A HREF="#fn_1963"><FONT SIZE="1">1964</FONT></A>
 &#8212;become acquainted with the Christ of God, and, after being initiated,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1964"></A><A HREF="#fn_1964"><FONT SIZE="1">1965</FONT></A>
 live a happy life.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.viii-p4"></A>When I had said this, my beloved friends&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1965"></A><A HREF="#fn_1965"><FONT SIZE="1">1966</FONT></A>
 those who were with Trypho laughed; but he, smiling, says, &#8220;I approve of your other remarks, and admire the eagerness with which you study divine things; but it were better for you still to abide in the philosophy of Plato, or of some other man, cultivating endurance, self-control, and moderation, rather than be deceived by false words, and follow the opinions of men of no reputation. For if you remain in that mode of philosophy, and live blamelessly, a hope of a better destiny were left to you; but when you have forsaken God, and reposed confidence in man, what safety still awaits you? If, then, you are willing to listen to me (for I have already considered you a friend), first be circumcised, then observe what ordinances have been enacted with respect to the Sabbath, and the feasts, and  <A NAME="page_199"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 199</FONT></A> <a name="viii.iv.viii-Page_199"></A>  the new moons of God; and, in a word, do all things which have been written in the law: and then perhaps you shall obtain mercy from God. But Christ &#8212;if He has indeed been born, and exists anywhere&#8212;is unknown, and does not even know Himself, and has no power until Elias come to anoint Him, and make Him manifest to all. And you, having accepted a groundless report, invent a Christ for yourselves, and for his sake are inconsiderately perishing.&#8221;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="viii.iv.viii-p2"></A> According to one interpretation, this clause is applied to God: &#8220;If you believe in God, seeing He is not indifferent to the matter,&#8221; etc. Maranus says that it means: A Jew who reads so much of Christ in the Old Testament, cannot be indifferent to the things which pertain to Him.</p>
