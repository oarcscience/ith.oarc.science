### <span id="v.vii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Let nothing be done without the bishop.

<span id="v.vii.viii-p1"></span><span id="v.vii.viii-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.vii.viii-p1.2"></span><span id="v.vii.viii-p1.3"></span>See that
ye all follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the
presbytery as ye would the apostles; and reverence the deacons, as being
the institution <span id="fr_1026"></span>[1027](#fn_1026) of God. <span
id="v.vii.viii-p2.1"></span><span id="v.vii.viii-p2.2"></span>Let no man
do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. <span
id="v.vii.viii-p2.3"></span><span id="v.vii.viii-p2.4"></span>Let that
be deemed a proper <span id="fr_1027"></span>[1028](#fn_1027) Eucharist,
which is \[administered\] either <span id="page_90">p. 90</span> <span
id="v.vii.viii-Page_90"></span> by the bishop, or by one to whom he has
entrusted it. <span id="v.vii.viii-p3.1"></span>Wherever the bishop
shall appear, there let the multitude \[of the people\] also be; even
as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. It is not
lawful without the bishop either to baptize or to celebrate a
love-feast; but whatsoever he shall approve of, that is also pleasing to
God, so that everything that is done may be secure and valid. <span
id="fr_1028"></span>[1029](#fn_1028)

<span id="v.vii.viii-p5"></span><span id="v.vii.viii-p5.1"></span><span
id="v.vii.viii-p5.2"></span>See that ye all follow the bishop, even as
Christ Jesus does the Father, and the presbytery as ye would the
apostles. <span id="v.vii.viii-p5.3"></span>Do ye also reverence the
deacons, as those that carry out \[through their office\] the
appointment of God. <span id="v.vii.viii-p5.4"></span><span
id="v.vii.viii-p5.5"></span>Let no man do anything connected with the
Church without the bishop. <span id="v.vii.viii-p5.6"></span><span
id="v.vii.viii-p5.7"></span>Let that be deemed a proper <span
id="fr_1029"></span>[1030](#fn_1029) Eucharist, which is
\[administered\] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has
entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude
\[of the people\] also be; even as where Christ is, there does all the
heavenly host stand by, waiting upon Him as the Chief Captain of the
Lord’s might, and the Governor of every intelligent nature. It is not
lawful without the bishop either to baptize, or to offer, or to present
sacrifice, or to celebrate a love-feast. <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[1031](#fn_1030) But that which seems good to him,
is also well-pleasing to God, that everything ye do may be secure and
valid.
