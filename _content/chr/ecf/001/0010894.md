<span id="ix.viii.xix-p1"></span><span
id="ix.viii.xix-p1.1"></span>“Take unto thee Joshua (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.viii.xix-p1.2"></span>᾽Ιησοῦν</span>) the son
of Nun.” <span id="fr_4825"></span>[4826](#fn_4825) For it was proper
that Moses should lead the people out of Egypt, but that Jesus
(*Joshua*) should lead them into the inheritance. Also that Moses, as
was the case with the law, should cease to be, but that Joshua (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.viii.xix-p2.2"></span>᾽Ιησοῦν</span>), as the
word, and no untrue type of the Word made <span id="page_572">p.
572</span> <span id="ix.viii.xix-Page_572"></span> flesh (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.viii.xix-p2.3"></span>ἐνυποστάτου</span>),
should be a preacher to the people. Then again, \[it was fit\] that
Moses should give manna as food to the fathers, but Joshua wheat; <span
id="fr_4826"></span>[4827](#fn_4826) as the first-fruits of life, a type
of the body of Christ, as also the Scripture declares that the manna of
the Lord ceased when the people had eaten wheat from the land. <span

(which is doubtful) to have been <span class="Greek"><span

sees an allusion to the wave-sheaf of the new corn offered in the temple
on the morning of our Lord’s resurrection.
