<p> <a name="ix.iv.xxv"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="ix.iv.xxv-p0.1"></A>Chapter XXIV.&#8212;Recapitulation of the various arguments adduced against Gnostic impiety under all its aspects. The heretics, tossed about by every blast of doctrine, are opposed by the uniform teaching of the Church, which remains so always, and is consistent with itself.</h3>  
<p><a name="ix.iv.xxv-p1"></A>1. Thus, then, have all these men been exposed, who bring in impious doctrines regarding our Maker and Framer, who also formed this world, and above whom there is no other God; and those have been overthrown by their own arguments who teach falsehoods regarding the substance of our Lord, and the dispensation which He fulfilled for the sake of His own creature man. But [it has, on the other hand, been shown], that the preaching of the Church is everywhere consistent, and continues in an even course, and receives testimony from the prophets, the apostles, and all the disciples&#8212;as I have proved&#8212; through [those in] the beginning, the middle, and the end,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3780"></A><A HREF="#fn_3780"><FONT SIZE="1">3781</FONT></A>
 and through the entire dispensation of God, and that well-grounded system which tends&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3781"></A><A HREF="#fn_3781"><FONT SIZE="1">3782</FONT></A>
 to man&#146;s salvation, namely, our faith; which, having been received from the Church, we do preserve, and which always, by the Spirit of God, renewing its youth, as if it were some precious deposit in an excellent vessel, causes the vessel itself containing it to renew its youth also. For this gift of God has been entrusted to the Church, as breath was to the first created man,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3782"></A><A HREF="#fn_3782"><FONT SIZE="1">3783</FONT></A>
 for this purpose, that all the members receiving it may be vivified; and the [means of] communion with Christ has been distributed throughout it, that is, the Holy Spirit, the earnest of incorruption, the means of confirming our faith, and the ladder of ascent to God. &#8220;For in the Church,&#8221; it is said, &#8220;God hath set apostles, prophets, teachers,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3783"></A><A HREF="#fn_3783"><FONT SIZE="1">3784</FONT></A>
 and all the other means through which the Spirit works; of which all those are not partakers who do not join themselves to the Church, but defraud themselves of life through their perverse opinions and infamous behaviour. For where the Church is, there is the Spirit of God; and where the Spirit of God is, there is the Church, and every kind of grace; but the Spirit is truth. Those, therefore, who do not partake of Him, are neither nourished into life from the mother&#146;s breasts, nor do they enjoy that most limpid fountain which issues from the body of Christ; but they dig for themselves broken cisterns&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3784"></A><A HREF="#fn_3784"><FONT SIZE="1">3785</FONT></A>
 out of earthly trenches, and drink putrid water out of the mire, fleeing from the faith of the Church lest they be convicted; and rejecting the Spirit, that they may not be instructed.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.iv.xxv-p7"></A>2. Alienated thus from the truth, they do deservedly wallow in all error, tossed to and fro by it, thinking differently in regard to the same things at different times, and never attaining to a well-grounded knowledge, being more anxious to be sophists of words than disciples of the truth. For they have not been founded upon the one rock, but upon the sand, which has in itself a multitude of stones. Wherefore they also imagine many gods, and they always have the excuse of searching [after truth] (for they are blind), but never succeed in finding it. For they blaspheme the Creator, Him who is truly God, who also furnishes power to find [the truth]; imagining that they have discovered another god beyond God, or another Pleroma, or another dispensation. Wherefore also the light which is from God does not illumine them, because they have dishonoured and despised God, holding Him of small account, because, through His love and infinite benignity, He has come within reach of human knowledge (knowledge, however, not with regard to His greatness, or with regard to His essence&#8212;for that has no  <A NAME="page_459"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 459</FONT></A> <a name="ix.iv.xxv-Page_459"></A>  man measured or handled&#8212;but after this sort: that we should know that He who made, and formed, and breathed in them the breath of life, and nourishes us by means of the creation, establishing all things by His Word, and binding them together by His Wisdom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3785"></A><A HREF="#fn_3785"><FONT SIZE="1">3786</FONT></A>
&#8212; this is He who is the only true God); but they dream of a non-existent being above Him, that they may be regarded as having found out the great God, whom nobody, [they hold,] can recognise holding communication with the human race, or as directing mundane matters: that is to say, they find out the god of Epicurus, who does nothing either for himself or others; that is, he exercises no providence at all.</p>
