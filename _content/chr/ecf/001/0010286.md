### <span id="v.xvi.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Salutations.

<span id="v.xvi.viii-p1"></span><span id="v.xvi.viii-p1.1"></span>The
bishops, Onesimus, Bitus, Damas, Polybius, and all they of Philippi
(whence also I have written to thee), salute thee in Christ. Salute the
presbytery worthy of God: salute my holy fellow-deacons, of whom may I
have joy in Christ, both in the flesh and in the spirit. Salute the
people of the Lord, from the smallest to the greatest, every one by
name; whom I commit to thee as Moses did \[the Israelites\] to Joshua,
who was their leader after him. And do not reckon this which I have said
presumptuous on my part; for although we are not such as they were, yet
we at least pray that we may be so, since indeed we are the children of
Abraham. Be strong, therefore, O Hero, like a hero, and like a man.
<span id="v.xvi.viii-p1.2"></span>For from henceforth thou shalt
lead <span id="fr_1291"></span>[1292](#fn_1291) in and out the people of
the Lord that are in Antioch, and so “the congregation of the Lord shall
not be as sheep which have no shepherd.” <span
id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292)
