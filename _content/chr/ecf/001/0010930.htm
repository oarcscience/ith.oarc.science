<p><a name="ix.viii.lv-p1"></A>&#8220;Then&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4913"></A><A HREF="#fn_4913"><FONT SIZE="1">4914</FONT></A>
 drew near unto Him the mother of Zebedee&#146;s children, with her sons, worshipping, and seeking a certain thing from Him.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4914"></A><A HREF="#fn_4914"><FONT SIZE="1">4915</FONT></A>
 These people are certainly not void of understanding, nor are the words set forth in that passage of no signification: being stated beforehand like a preface, they have some agreement with those points formerly expounded.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.viii.lv-p4"></A>&#8220;Then drew near.&#8221; Sometimes virtue excites our admiration, not merely on account of the display which is given of it, but also of the occasion when it was manifested. I may refer, for example, to the premature fruit of the grape, or of the fig, or to any fruit whatsoever, from which, during its process [of growth], no man expects maturity or full development; yet, although any one may perceive that it is still somewhat imperfect, he does not for that reason despise as useless the immature grape when plucked, but he gathers it with pleasure as appearing early in the season; nor does he consider whether the grape is possessed of perfect sweetness; nay, he at once experiences satisfaction from the thought that this one has appeared before the rest. Just in the same way does God also, when He perceives the faithful possessing wisdom though still imperfect, and but a small degree of faith, overlook their defect in this respect, and therefore does not reject them; nay, but on the contrary, He kindly welcomes and accepts them as premature fruits, and honours the mind, whatsoever it may be, which is stamped with virtue, although not yet perfect. He makes allowance for it, as being among the harbingers of the vintage,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4915"></A><A HREF="#fn_4915"><FONT SIZE="1">4916</FONT></A>
 and esteems it highly, inasmuch as, being of a readier disposition than the rest, it has forestalled, as it were, the blessing to itself.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.viii.lv-p6"></A>  <A NAME="page_578"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 578</FONT></A> <a name="ix.viii.lv-Page_578"></A>  Abraham therefore, Isaac, and Jacob, our fathers, are to be esteemed before all, since they did indeed afford us such early examples of virtue. How many martyrs can be compared to Daniel? How many martyrs, I ask, can rival the three youths in Babylon, although the memory of the former has not been brought before us so conspicuously as that of the latter? These were truly first-fruits, and indications of the [succeeding] fructification. Hence God has directed their life to be recorded, as a model for those who should come after.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.viii.lv-p7"></A>And that their virtue was thus accepted by God, as the first-fruits of the produce, hear what He has Himself declared: &#8220;As a grape,&#8221; He says, &#8220;I have found Israel in the wilderness, and as first-ripe figs your fathers.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4916"></A><A HREF="#fn_4916"><FONT SIZE="1">4917</FONT></A>
 Call not therefore the faith of Abraham merely blessed because he believed. Do you wish to look upon Abraham with admiration? Then behold how that one man alone professed piety when in the world six hundred had been contaminated with error. Dost thou wish Daniel to carry thee away to amazement? Behold that [city] Babylon, haughty in the flower and pride of impiousness, and its inhabitants completely given over to sin of every description. But he, emerging from the depth, spat out the brine of sins, and rejoiced to plunge into the sweet waters of piety. And now, in like manner, with regard to that mother of Zebedee&#146;s children, do not admire merely what she said, but also the time at which she uttered these words. For when was it that she drew near to the Redeemer? Not after the resurrection, nor after the preaching of His name, nor after the establishment of His kingdom; but it was when the Lord said, &#8220;Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and they shall kill Him, and on the third day He shall rise again.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4917"></A><A HREF="#fn_4917"><FONT SIZE="1">4918</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="ix.viii.lv-p10"></A>These things the Saviour told in reference to His sufferings and cross; to these persons He predicted His passion. Nor did He conceal the fact that it should be of a most ignominious kind, at the hands of the chief priests. This woman, however, had attached another meaning to the dispensation of His sufferings. The Saviour was foretelling death; and she asked for the glory of immortality. The Lord was asserting that He must stand arraigned before impious judges; but she, taking no note of that judgment, requested as of the judge: &#8220;Grant,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that these my two sons may sit, one on the right hand, and the other on the left, in Thy glory.&#8221; In the one case the passion is referred to, in the other the kingdom is understood. The Saviour was speaking of the cross, while she had in view the glory which admits no suffering. This woman, therefore, as I have already said, is worthy of our admiration, not merely for what she sought, but also for the occasion of her making the request.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.viii.lv-p11"></A>She did indeed suffer, not merely as a pious person, but also as a woman. For, having been instructed by His words, she considered and believed that it would come to pass, that the kingdom of Christ should flourish in glory, and walk in its vastness throughout the world, and be increased by the preaching of piety. She understood, as was [in fact] the case, that He who appeared in a lowly guise had delivered and received every promise. I will inquire upon another occasion, when I come to treat upon this humility, whether the Lord rejected her petition concerning His kingdom. But she thought that the same confidence would not be possessed by her, when, at the appearance of the angels, He should be ministered to by the angels, and receive service from the entire heavenly host. Taking the Saviour, therefore, apart in a retired place, she earnestly desired of Him those things which transcend every human nature.</p>
