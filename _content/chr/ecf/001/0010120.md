### <span id="iv.iv.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Salutation.

<span id="iv.iv.xxii-p1"></span><span id="iv.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>We
wish you, brethren, all happiness, while you walk according to the
doctrine of the Gospel of Jesus Christ; with whom be glory to God the
Father and the Holy Spirit, for the salvation of His holy elect, after
whose example <span id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478) the blessed
Polycarp suffered, following in whose steps may we too be found in the
kingdom of Jesus Christ!

<span id="iv.iv.xxii-p3"></span>These things <span
id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479) Caius transcribed from the copy of
Irenæus (who was a disciple of Polycarp), having himself been intimate
with Irenæus. And I Socrates transcribed them at Corinth from the copy
of Caius. Grace be with you all.

<span id="iv.iv.xxii-p5"></span>And I again, Pionius, wrote them from
the previously written copy, having carefully searched into them, and
the blessed Polycarp having <span id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span
id="iv.iv.xxii-Page_44"></span> manifested them to me through a
revelation, even as I shall show in what follows. <span
id="iv.iv.xxii-p5.1"></span>I have collected these things, when they had
almost faded away through the lapse of time, that the Lord Jesus Christ
may also gather me along with His elect into His heavenly kingdom, to
whom, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, be glory for ever and ever.
Amen.
