<span id="viii.ix.xi-p1"></span><span id="viii.ix.xi-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.ix.xi-p1.2"></span>When God formed man at the beginning, He
suspended the things of nature on his will, and made an experiment by
means of one commandment. For He ordained that, if he kept this, he
should partake of immortal existence; but if he transgressed it, the
contrary should be his lot. Man having been thus made, and immediately
looking towards transgression, naturally became subject to corruption.
Corruption then becoming inherent in nature, it was necessary that He
who wished to save should be one who destroyed the efficient cause of
corruption. And this could not otherwise be done than by the life which
is according to nature being united to that which had received the
corruption, and so destroying the corruption, while preserving as
immortal for the future that which had received it. It was therefore
necessary that the Word should become possessed of a body, that He might
deliver us from the death of natural corruption. For if, as ye <span
id="fr_2638"></span>[2639](#fn_2638) say, He had simply by a nod warded
off death from us, death indeed would not have approached us on account
of the expression of His will; but none the less would we again have
become corruptible, inasmuch as we carried about in ourselves that
natural corruption.—<span class="upper"><span
