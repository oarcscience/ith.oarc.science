<p><a name="viii.xi.v-p1"></A>Rusticus the prefect pronounced sentence, saying, &#8220;Let those who have refused to sacrifice to the gods and to yield to the command of the emperor be scourged,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2647"></A><A HREF="#fn_2647"><FONT SIZE="1">2648</FONT></A>
 and led away to suffer the punishment of decapitation, according to the laws.&#8221; The holy martyrs having glorified God, and having gone forth to the accustomed place, were beheaded, and perfected their testimony in the confession of the Saviour. And some of the faithful having secretly removed their bodies, laid them in a suitable place, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ having wrought along with them, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
