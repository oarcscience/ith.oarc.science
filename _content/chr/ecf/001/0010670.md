<span id="viii.ix.iii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ix.iii-p1.1"></span>Justin well said: Before the advent of the
Lord, Satan never ventured to blaspheme God, inasmuch as he was not yet
sure of his own damnation, since that was announced concerning him by
the prophets only in parables and allegories. But after the advent of
the Lord learning plainly from the discourses of Christ and His apostles
that eternal fire was prepared for him who voluntarily departed from God
and for all who, without repentance, persevere in apostasy, then, by
means of a man of this sort, he, as if already condemned, blasphemes
that God who inflicts judgment upon him, and imputes the sin of his
apostasy to his Maker, instead of to his own will and
predilection.—<span class="upper"><span
