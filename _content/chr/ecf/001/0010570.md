### <span id="viii.iv.cix-p0.1"></span>Chapter CIX.—The conversion of the Gentiles has been predicted by Micah.

<span id="viii.iv.cix-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv.cix-p1.1"></span>“But
that the Gentiles would repent of the evil in which they led erring
lives, when they heard the doctrine preached by His apostles from
Jerusalem, and which they learned <span
id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363) through them, suffer me to show you
by quoting a short statement from the prophecy of Micah, one of the
twelve \[minor prophets\]. This is as follows: ‘And in the last days the
mountain of the Lord shall be manifest, established on the top of the
mountains; it shall be exalted above the hills, and people shall flow
unto it. <span id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364) And many nations
shall go, and say, Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and
to the house of the God of Jacob; and they shall enlighten us in His
way, and we shall walk in His paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the
law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And He shall judge among
many peoples, and shall rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall
beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into sickles:
nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they
learn war any more. And each man shall sit under his vine and under his
fig tree; and there shall be none to terrify: for the mouth of the Lord
of hosts hath spoken it. For all people will walk in the name of their
gods; but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever. And it
shall come to pass in that day, that I will assemble her that is
afflicted, and gather her that is driven out, and whom I had plagued;
and I shall make her that is afflicted a remnant, and her that is
oppressed a strong nation. And the Lord shall reign over them in Mount
Zion from henceforth, and even for ever.’ ” <span
id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365)
