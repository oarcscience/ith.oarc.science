### <span id="v.xii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="v.xii.v-p1"></span>From Syria, and even unto Rome, I am cast
among wild beasts, by sea and by land, by night and by day, being bound
between ten leopards, which are the band of soldiers, who, even when I
do good to them, all the more do evil unto me. I, however, am the rather
instructed by their injurious treatment; <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[1166](#fn_1165) but not on this account am I
justified to myself. I rejoice in the beasts which are prepared for me,
and I pray that they may in haste be found for me; and I will provoke
them speedily to devour me, and not be as those which are afraid of some
other men, <span id="fr_1166"></span>[1167](#fn_1166) and will not
approach them: even should they not be willing to approach me, I will go
with violence against them. Know me from myself what is expedient for
me. <span id="fr_1167"></span>[1168](#fn_1167) Let no one <span
id="fr_1168"></span>[1169](#fn_1168) envy me of those things which are
seen and which are not seen, that I should be accounted worthy of Jesus
Christ. Fire, and the cross, and the beasts that are prepared, cutting
off of the limbs, and scattering of the hones, and crushing of the whole
body, harsh torments of the devil—let these come upon me, but <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[1170](#fn_1169) only let me be accounted worthy of
Jesus Christ.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1165"></span>[104:1166](0010247.htm#fr_1165) <span
id="v.xii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.xii.v-p2"></span> Literally, “by their injury.”

<span id="fn_1166"></span>[104:1167](0010247.htm#fr_1166) <span
id="v.xii.v-p2.1"></span>

<span id="v.xii.v-p3"></span> Literally, “and not as that which is
afraid of some other men.” So Cureton translates, but remarks that the
passage is evidently corrupt. The reference plainly is to the fact that
the beasts sometimes refused to attack their intended victims. See the
case of Blandina, as reported by Eusebius (*Hist. Eccl.*, v. 1.).

<span id="fn_1167"></span>[104:1168](0010247.htm#fr_1167) <span
id="v.xii.v-p3.1"></span>

<span id="v.xii.v-p4"></span> Cureton renders interrogatively, “What is
expedient for me?” and remarks that “the meaning of the Syriac appears
to be, ‘I crave your indulgence to leave the knowledge of what is
expedient for me to my own conscience.’ ”

<span id="fn_1168"></span>[104:1169](0010247.htm#fr_1168) <span
id="v.xii.v-p4.1"></span>

<span id="v.xii.v-p5"></span> Literally, “nothing.”

<span id="fn_1169"></span>[104:1170](0010247.htm#fr_1169) <span
id="v.xii.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.xii.v-p6"></span> Literally, “and.”
