### <span id="iii.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The manifestation of Christ.

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p1"></span><span id="iii.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>For,
as I said, this was no mere earthly invention which was delivered to
them, nor is it a mere human system of opinion, which they judge it
right to preserve so carefully, nor has a dispensation of mere human
mysteries been committed to them, but truly God Himself, who is
almighty, the Creator of all things, and invisible, has sent from
heaven, and placed among men, \[Him who is\] the truth, and the holy and
incomprehensible Word, and has firmly established Him in their hearts.
He did not, as one might have imagined, send to men any servant, or
angel, or ruler, or any one of those who bear sway over earthly things,
or one of those to whom the government of things in the heavens has been
entrusted, but the very Creator and Fashioner of all things—by whom He
made the heavens—by whom he enclosed the sea within its proper
bounds—whose ordinances <span id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294) all the
stars <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295) faithfully observe—from
whom the sun <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296) has received the
measure of his daily course to be observed <span
id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297) — whom the moon obeys, being commanded
to shine in the night, and whom the stars also obey, following the moon
in her course; by whom all things have been arranged, and placed within
their proper limits, and to whom all are subject—the heavens and the
things that are therein, the earth and the things that are therein, the
sea and the things that are therein—fire, air, and the abyss—the things
which are in the heights, the things which are in the depths, and the
things which lie between. This \[messenger\] He sent to them. Was it
then, as one <span id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298) might conceive, for
the purpose of exercising tyranny, or of inspiring fear and terror? By
no means, but under the influence of clemency and meekness. As a king
sends his son, who is also a king, so sent He Him; as God <span
id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299) He sent Him; as to men He sent Him; as
a Saviour He sent Him, and as seeking to persuade, not to compel us; for
violence has no place in the character of God. As calling us He sent
Him, not as vengefully pursuing us; as loving us He sent Him, not as
judging us. For He will yet send Him to judge us, and who shall endure
His appearing? <span id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300) … Do you not see
them exposed to wild beasts, <span id="page_28">p. 28</span> <span
id="iii.ii.vii-Page_28"></span> that they may be persuaded to deny the
Lord, and yet not overcome? Do you not see that the more of them are
punished, the greater becomes the number of the rest? This does not seem
to be the work of man: this is the power of God; these are the evidences
of His manifestation.
