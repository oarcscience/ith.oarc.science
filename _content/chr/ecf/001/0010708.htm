<p> <a name="ix.ii.xii"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="ix.ii.xii-p0.1"></A>Chapter XI.&#8212;The opinions of Valentinus, with those of his disciples and others.</h3>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xii-p1"></A>1. <a name="ix.ii.xii-p1.1"></A><a name="ix.ii.xii-p1.2"></A> Let us now look at the inconsistent opinions of those heretics (for there are some two or three of them), how they do not agree in treating the same points, but alike, in things and names, set forth opinions mutually discordant. The first&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2798"></A><A HREF="#fn_2798"><FONT SIZE="1">2799</FONT></A>
 of them, Valentinus, who adapted the principles of the heresy called &#8220;Gnostic&#8221; to the peculiar character of his own school, taught as follows: <a name="ix.ii.xii-p2.1"></A>He maintained that there is a certain Dyad (twofold being), who is inexpressible by any name, of whom one part should be called Arrhetus (unspeakable), and the other Sige (silence). But of this Dyad a second was produced, one part of whom he names Pater, and the other Aletheia. From this Tetrad, again, arose Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia. These constitute the primary Ogdoad. He next states that from Logos and Zoe ten powers were produced, as we have before mentioned. But from Anthropos and Ecclesia proceeded twelve, one of which separating from the rest, and falling from its original condition, produced the rest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2799"></A><A HREF="#fn_2799"><FONT SIZE="1">2800</FONT></A>
 of the universe. He also supposed two beings of the name of Horos, the one of whom has his place between Bythus and the rest of the Pleroma, and divides the created &AElig;ons from the uncreated Father, while the other separates their mother from the Pleroma. <a name="ix.ii.xii-p3.1"></A>Christ also was not produced from the &AElig;ons within the Pleroma, but was brought forth by the mother who had been excluded from it, in virtue of her remembrance of better things, but not without a kind of shadow. He, indeed, as being masculine, having severed the shadow from himself, returned to the Pleroma; but his mother being left with the shadow, and deprived of her spiritual substance, brought forth another son, namely, the Demiurge, whom he also styles the supreme ruler of all those things which are subject to him. He also asserts that, along with the Demiurge, there was produced a left-hand power, in which particular he agrees with those falsely called Gnostics, of whom to we have yet to speak. Sometimes, again, he maintains that Jesus was produced from him who was separated from their mother, and united to the rest, that is, from Theletus, sometimes as springing from him who returned into the Pleroma, that is, from Christ; and at other times still as derived from Anthropos and Ecclesia. And he declares that the Holy Spirit was produced by Aletheia&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2800"></A><A HREF="#fn_2800"><FONT SIZE="1">2801</FONT></A>
 for the inspection and fructification of the &AElig;ons, by entering invisibly into them, and that, in this way, the &AElig;ons brought forth the plants of truth.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xii-p5"></A>2. Secundus again affirms that the primary Ogdoad consists of a right hand and a left hand Tetrad, and teaches that the one of these is called light, and the other darkness. But he maintains that the power which separated from the rest, and fell away, did not proceed directly from the thirty &AElig;ons, but from their fruits.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xii-p6"></A>3. There is another,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2801"></A><A HREF="#fn_2801"><FONT SIZE="1">2802</FONT></A>
 who is a renowned teacher among them, and who, struggling to reach something more sublime, and to attain to a kind of higher knowledge, has explained the primary Tetrad as follows: <a name="ix.ii.xii-p7.1"></A>There is [he says] a certain Proarche who existed before all things, surpassing all thought, speech, and nomenclature, whom I call Monotes (unity). Together with this Monotes there exists a power, which again I term <a name="ix.ii.xii-p7.2"></A>Henotes (oneness). This Henotes and Monotes, being one, produced, yet not so as to bring forth [apart from themselves, as an emanation] the beginning of all things, an intelligent, unbegotten, and invisible being, which beginning language terms &#8220;Monad.&#8221; With this Monad there co-exists a power of the same essence, which again I term Hen (One). These powers then&#8212; Monotes, and Henotes, and Monas, and Hen&#8212;produced the remaining company of the &AElig;ons.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xii-p8"></A>4. <a name="ix.ii.xii-p8.1"></A><a name="ix.ii.xii-p8.2"></A>Iu, Iu! Pheu, Pheu!&#8212;for well may we utter these tragic exclamations at such a pitch of audacity in the coining of names as he has displayed without a blush, in devising a nomenclature for his system of falsehood. For when he declares: There is a certain Proarche before all things, surpassing all thought, whom I call Monotes; and again, with this Monotes there co-exists a power which I also call Henotes,&#8212;it is most manifest that he confesses the things which have been said to be his own invention, and that he himself has given names to his scheme of things, which had never been previously suggested by any other. It is manifest also, that he himself is the one who has had sufficient audacity to coin these names; so that, unless <i>he</i> had appeared in the world, the truth would still have been destitute of a name. But, in that case, nothing hinders any other, in dealing with the same subject, to affix names after such a fashion as the following: <a name="ix.ii.xii-p8.3"></A>There&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2802"></A><A HREF="#fn_2802"><FONT SIZE="1">2803</FONT></A>
 is a certain Proarche, royal, surpassing all thought, a power existing before every other substance, and extended into space in every direction. But along with it there exists a power which I term a <i>Gourd</i>; and along  <A NAME="page_333"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 333</FONT></A> <a name="ix.ii.xii-Page_333"></A>  with this Gourd there exists a power which again I term <i>Utter-Emptiness</i>. This Gourd and Emptiness, since they are one, produced (and yet did not simply produce, so as to be apart from themselves) a fruit, everywhere visible, eatable, and delicious, which fruit-language calls a <i>Cucumber</i>. Along with this Cucumber exists a power of the same essence, which again I call a <i>Melon</i>. These powers, the Gourd, Utter-Emptiness, the Cucumber, and the Melon, brought forth the remaining multitude of the delirious melons of Valentinus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2803"></A><A HREF="#fn_2803"><FONT SIZE="1">2804</FONT></A>
 For if it is fitting that that language which is used respecting the universe be transformed to the primary Tetrad, and if any one may assign names at his pleasure, who shall prevent us from adopting these names, as being much more credible [than the others], as well as in general use, and understood by all?</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xii-p11"></A>5. Others still, however, have called their primary and first-begotten Ogdoad by the following names: first, <a name="ix.ii.xii-p11.1"></A>Proarche; then Anennoetos; thirdly, Arrhetos; and fourthly, Aoratos. Then, from the first, Proarche, there was produced, in the first and fifth place, Arche; from Anennoetos, in the second and sixth place, Acataleptos; from Arrhetos, in the third and seventh place, Anonomastos; and from Aoratos, in the fourth and eighth place, Agennetos. This is the Pleroma of the first Ogdoad. They maintain that these powers were anterior to Bythus and Sige, that they may appear more perfect than the perfect, and more knowing than the very Gnostics! To these persons one may justly exclaim: &#8220;O ye trifling sophists!&#8221; since, even respecting Bythus himself, there are among them many and discordant opinions. For some declare him to be without a consort, and neither male nor female, and, in fact, nothing at all; while others affirm him to be masculo-feminine, assigning to him the nature of a hermaphrodite; others, again, allot Sige to him as a spouse, that thus may be formed the first conjunction.</p>
