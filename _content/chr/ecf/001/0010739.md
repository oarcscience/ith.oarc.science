### <span id="ix.iii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—There is but one Creator of the world, God the Father: this the constant belief of the Church.

<span id="ix.iii.x-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.iii.x-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.iii.x-p1.2"></span>That God is the Creator of the world is
accepted even by those very persons who in many ways speak against Him,
and yet acknowledge Him, styling Him the Creator, and an angel, not to
mention that all the Scriptures call out \[to the same effect\], and the
Lord teaches us of this Father <span
id="fr_3026"></span>[3027](#fn_3026) who is in heaven, and no other, as
I shall show in the sequel of this work. For the present, however, that
proof which is derived from those who allege doctrines opposite to ours,
is of itself sufficient,—all men, in fact, consenting to this truth: the
ancients on their part preserving with special care, from the tradition
of the first-formed man, this persuasion, while they celebrate the
praises of one God, the Maker of heaven and earth; others, again, after
them, being reminded of this fact by the prophets of God, while the very
heathen learned it from creation itself. For even creation reveals Him
who formed it, and the very work made suggests Him who made it, and the
world manifests Him who ordered it. The Universal Church, moreover,
through the whole world, has received this tradition from the apostles.

<span id="ix.iii.x-p3"></span>2. This God, then, being acknowledged, as
I have said, and receiving testimony from all to the fact of His
existence, that Father whom they conjure into existence is beyond doubt
untenable, and has no witnesses \[to his existence\]. Simon Magus was
the first who said that he himself was God over all, and that the world
was formed by his angels. Then those who succeeded him, as I have shown
in the first book, <span id="fr_3027"></span>[3028](#fn_3027) by their
several opinions, still further depraved \[his teaching\] through their
impious and irreligious doctrines against the Creator. These \[heretics
now referred to\], <span id="fr_3028"></span>[3029](#fn_3028) being the
disciples of those mentioned, render such as assent to them worse than
the heathen. For the former “serve the creature rather than the
Creator,” <span id="fr_3029"></span>[3030](#fn_3029) and “those which
are not gods,” <span id="fr_3030"></span>[3031](#fn_3030)
notwithstanding that they ascribe the first place in Deity to that God
who was the Maker of this universe. But the latter maintain that He,
\[i.e., the Creator of this world,\] is the fruit of a defect, and
describe Him as being of an animal nature, and as not knowing that Power
which is above Him, while He also exclaims, “I am God, and besides Me
there is no other God.” <span id="fr_3031"></span>[3032](#fn_3031)
Affirming that He lies, they are themselves liars, attributing all sorts
of wickedness to Him; and conceiving of one who is not above this Being
as really having an existence, they are thus convicted by their own
views of blasphemy against that God who really exists, while they
conjure into existence a god who has no existence, to their own
condemnation. And thus those who declare themselves “perfect,” and as
being possessed of the knowledge of all things, are found to be worse
than the heathen, and to entertain more blasphemous opinions even
against their own Creator.
