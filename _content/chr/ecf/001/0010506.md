### <span id="viii.iv.xlv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLV.—Those who were righteous before and under the law shall be saved by Christ.

<span id="viii.iv.xlv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xlv-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xlv-p1.2"></span>And
Trypho said, “If I seem to interrupt these matters, which you say must
be investigated, yet the question which I mean to put is urgent. Suffer
me first.”

<span id="viii.iv.xlv-p2"></span>And I replied, “Ask whatever you
please, as it occurs to you; and I shall endeavour, after questions and
answers, to resume and complete the discourse.”

<span id="viii.iv.xlv-p3"></span>Then he said, “Tell me, then, shall
those who lived according to the law given by Moses, live in the same
manner with Jacob, Enoch, and Noah, in the resurrection of the dead, or
not?”

<span id="viii.iv.xlv-p4"></span>I replied to him, “When I quoted, sir,
the words spoken by Ezekiel, that ‘even if Noah and Daniel and Jacob
were to beg sons and daughters, the request would not be granted them,’
but that each one, that is to say, shall be saved by his own
righteousness, I said also, that those who regulated their lives by the
law of Moses would in like manner be saved. For what in the law of Moses
is naturally good, and pious, and righteous, and has been prescribed to
be done by those who obey it; <span id="fr_2083"></span>[2084](#fn_2083)
and what was appointed to be performed by reason of the hardness of the
people’s hearts; was similarly recorded, and done also by those who were
under the law. Since those who did that which is universally, naturally,
and eternally good are pleasing to God, they shall be saved through this
Christ in the resurrection equally with those righteous men who were
before them, namely Noah, and Enoch, and Jacob, and whoever else there
be, along with those who have known <span
id="fr_2084"></span>[2085](#fn_2084) this Christ, Son of God, who was
before the morning star and the moon, and submitted to become incarnate,
and be born of this virgin of the family of David, in order that, by
this dispensation, the serpent that sinned from the beginning, and the
angels like him, may be destroyed, and that death may be contemned, and
for ever quit, at the second coming of the Christ Himself, those who
believe in Him and live acceptably,—and be no more: when some are sent
to be punished unceasingly into judgment and condemnation of fire; but
others shall exist in freedom from suffering, from corruption, and from
grief, and in immortality.”
