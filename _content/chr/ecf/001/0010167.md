### <span id="v.iv.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—I will not teach you profound doctrines.

<span id="v.iv.v-p1"></span><span id="v.iv.v-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.iv.v-p1.2"></span><span id="v.iv.v-p1.3"></span>Am I not able to
write to you of heavenly things? But I fear to do so, lest I should
inflict injury on you who are but babes \[in Christ\]. Pardon me in this
respect, lest, as not being able to receive \[such doctrines\], ye
should be strangled by them. <span id="v.iv.v-p1.4"></span>For even I,
though I am bound \[for Christ\], yet am not on that account able to
understand heavenly things, and the places <span
id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749) of the angels, and their gatherings
under their respective princes, things visible and invisible. Without
reference to such abstruse subjects, I am still but a learner \[in other
respects <span id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750) \]; for many things are
wanting to us, that we come not short of God.

<span id="v.iv.v-p4"></span><span id="v.iv.v-p4.1"></span><span
id="v.iv.v-p4.2"></span><span id="v.iv.v-p4.3"></span>For might <span
id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751) not I write to you things more full of
mystery? But I fear to do so, lest I should inflict injury on you who
are but babes \[in Christ\]. Pardon me in this respect, lest, as not
being able to receive their weighty import, <span
id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752) ye should be strangled by them. <span
id="v.iv.v-p6.1"></span>For even I, though I am bound \[for Christ\],
and am able to understand heavenly things, the angelic orders, and the
different sorts <span id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753) of angels and
hosts, the distinctions between powers and dominions, and the
diversities between thrones and authorities, the mightiness of the Æons,
and the pre-eminence of the cherubim and seraphim, the sublimity of the
spirit, the kingdom of the Lord, and above all, the incomparable majesty
of Almighty God—though I am acquainted with these things, yet am I not
therefore by any means perfect; nor am I such a disciple as Paul or
Peter. For many things are yet wanting to me, that I may not fall short
of God.
