## <span id="vii.i-p0.1"></span>Introductory Note to the Fragments of Papias

<span id="vii.i-p1"></span><span id="vii.i-p1.1"></span>\[<span
class="upper"><span id="vii.i-p1.2"></span>a.d.</span> 70–155.\] <span
class="upper"><span id="vii.i-p1.3"></span>It</span> seems unjust to the
holy man of whose comparatively large contributions to early Christian
literature such mere relics have been preserved, to set them forth in
these versions, unaccompanied by the copious annotations of Dr. Routh.
If even such crumbs from his table are not by any means without a
practical value, with reference to the Canon and other matters, we may
well credit the testimony (though disputed) of Eusebius, that he was a
learned man, and well versed in the Holy Scripture. <span
id="fr_1728"></span>[1729](#fn_1728) All who name poor Papias are sure
to do so with the apologetic qualification of that historian, that he
was of slender capacity. Nobody who attributes to him the millenarian
fancies, of which he was but a narrator, as if these were the
characteristics rather than the blemishes of his works, can fail to
accept this estimate of our author. But more may be said when we come to
the great name of Irenæus, who seems to make himself responsible for
them. <span id="fr_1729"></span>[1730](#fn_1729)

<span id="vii.i-p4"></span>Papias has the credit of association with
Polycarp, in the friendship of St. John himself, and of “others who had
seen the Lord.” He is said to have been bishop of Hierapolis, in
Phrygia, and to have died about the same time that Polycarp suffered;
but even this is questioned. So little do we know of one whose lost
books, could they be recovered, might reverse the received judgment, and
establish his claim to the disputed tribute which makes him, like
Apollos, “an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures.”

<span id="vii.i-p5"></span>The following is the original <span
class="upper"><span id="vii.i-p5.1"></span>Introductory Notice</span>:—

<span id="vii.i-p6"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="vii.i-p6.1"></span>The</span> principal information in regard to
Papias is given in the extracts made among the fragments from the works
of Irenæus and Eusebius. He was bishop of the Church in Hierapolis, a
city of Phrygia, in the first half of the second century. Later writers
affirm that he suffered martyrdom about <span class="upper"><span
id="vii.i-p6.2"></span>a.d.</span> 163; some saying that Rome, others
that Pergamus, was the scene of his death. He was a hearer of the
Apostle John, and was on terms of intimate intercourse with many who had
known the Lord and His apostles. From these he gathered the floating
traditions in regard to the sayings of our Lord, and wove them into a
production divided into five books. This work does not seem to have been
confined to an exposition of the sayings of Christ, but to have
contained much historical information.

<span id="vii.i-p7"></span> <span id="page_152">p. 152</span> <span
id="vii.i-Page_152"></span> Eusebius <span
id="fr_1730"></span>[1731](#fn_1730) speaks of Papias as a man most
learned in all things, and well acquainted with the Scriptures. In
another passage <span id="fr_1731"></span>[1732](#fn_1731) he describes
him as of small capacity. The fragments of Papias are translated from
the text given in Routh’s *Reliquiæ Sacræ*, vol. i. <span
id="fr_1732"></span>[1733](#fn_1732)
