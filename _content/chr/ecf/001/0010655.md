### <span id="viii.vii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—We should acknowledge one only God.

<span id="viii.vii.vi-p1"></span>Here, then, is a proof of virtue, and
of a mind loving prudence, to recur to the communion of the unity, <span
id="fr_2610"></span>[2611](#fn_2610) and to attach one’s self to
prudence for salvation, and make choice of the better things according
to the free-will placed in man; and not to think that those who are
possessed of human passions are lords of all, when they shall not appear
to have even equal power with men. For in Homer, <span
id="fr_2611"></span>[2612](#fn_2611) Demodocus says he is self-taught —

> <span id="viii.vii.vi-p3.1"></span>“God inspired me with strains”—  

<span id="viii.vii.vi-p4"></span>though he is a mortal. Æsculapius and
Apollo are taught to heal by Chiron the Centaur,—a very novel thing
indeed, for gods to be taught by a man. What need I speak of Bacchus,
who the poet says is mad? or of Hercules, who he says is unhappy? What
need to speak of Mars and Venus, the leaders of adultery; and by means
of all these to establish the proof which has been undertaken? For if
some one, in ignorance, should imitate the deeds which are said to be
divine, he would be reckoned among impure men, and a stranger to life
and humanity; and if any one does so knowingly, he will have a plausible
excuse for escaping vengeance, by showing that imitation of godlike
deeds of audacity is no sin. But if any one should blame these deeds, he
will take away their well-known names, and not cover them up with
specious and plausible words. It is necessary, then, to accept the true
and invariable Name, not proclaimed by my words only, but by the words
of those who have introduced us to the elements of learning, in order
that we may not, by living idly in this present state of existence, not
only as those who are ignorant of the heavenly glory, but also as having
proved ourselves ungrateful, render our account to the Judge. <span
