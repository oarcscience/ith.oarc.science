### <span id="viii.iv.lvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LVII.—The Jew objects, why is He said to have eaten, if He be God? Answer of Justin.

<span id="viii.iv.lvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lvii-p1.1"></span>Then Trypho said when I was silent, “That
Scripture compels us to admit this, is manifest; but there is a matter
about which we are deservedly at a loss —namely, about what was said to
the effect that \[the Lord\] ate what was prepared and placed before him
by Abraham; and you would admit this.”

<span id="viii.iv.lvii-p2"></span>I answered, “It is written that they
ate; and if we believe <span id="fr_2147"></span>[2148](#fn_2147) that
it is said the three ate, and not the two alone—who were really angels,
and are nourished in the heavens, as is evident to us, even though they
are not nourished by food similar to that which mortals use—(for,
concerning the sustenance of manna which supported your fathers in the
desert, Scripture speaks thus, that they ate angels’ food): \[if we
believe that three ate\], then I would say that the Scripture which
affirms they ate bears the same meaning as when we would say about fire
that it has devoured all things; yet it is not certainly understood that
they ate, masticating with teeth and jaws. So that not even here should
we be at a loss about anything, if we are acquainted even slightly with
figurative modes of expression, and able to rise above them.”

<span id="viii.iv.lvii-p4"></span>And Trypho said, “It is possible that
\[the question\] about the mode of eating may be thus explained: \[the
mode, that is to say,\] in which it is written, they took and ate what
had been prepared by Abraham: so that you may now proceed to explain to
us how this God who appeared to Abraham, and is minister to God the
Maker of all things, being born of the Virgin, became man, of like
passions with all, as you said previously.”

<span id="viii.iv.lvii-p5"></span>Then I replied, “Permit me first,
Trypho, to collect some other proofs on this head, so that you, by the
large number of them, may be persuaded of \[the truth of\] it, and
thereafter I shall explain what you ask.”

<span id="viii.iv.lvii-p6"></span>And he said, “Do as seems good to you;
for I shall be thoroughly pleased.”
