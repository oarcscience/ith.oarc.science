<p> <a name="viii.iv.lxv"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.iv.lxv-p0.1"></A>Chapter LXV.&#8212;The Jew objects that God does not give His glory to another. Justin explains the passage.</h3>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.lxv-p1"></A><a name="viii.iv.lxv-p1.1"></A>And Trypho said, &#8220;Being shaken&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2193"></A><A HREF="#fn_2193"><FONT SIZE="1">2194</FONT></A>
 by so many Scriptures, I know not what to say about the Scripture which Isaiah writes, in which God says that He gives not His glory to another, speaking thus &#145;I am the Lord God; this is my name; my glory will I not give to another, nor my virtues.&#146; &#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2194"></A><A HREF="#fn_2194"><FONT SIZE="1">2195</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.lxv-p4"></A>And I answered, &#8220;If you spoke these words, Trypho, and then kept silence in simplicity and with no ill intent, neither repeating what goes before nor adding what comes after, you must be forgiven; but if [you have done so] because you imagined that you could throw doubt on the passage, in order that I might say the Scriptures contradicted each other, you have erred. But I shall not venture to suppose or to say such a thing; and if a Scripture which appears to be of such a kind be brought forward, and if there be a pretext [for saying] that it is contrary [to some other], since I am entirely convinced that no Scripture contradicts another, I shall admit rather that I do not understand what is recorded, and shall strive to persuade those who imagine that the Scriptures are contradictory, to be rather of the same opinion as myself. With what intent, then, you have brought forward the difficulty, God knows. But I shall remind you of what the passage says, in order that you may recognise even from this very [place] that God gives glory to His Christ alone. And I shall take up some short passages, sirs, those which are in connection with what has been said by Trypho, and those which are also joined on in consecutive order. For I will not repeat those of another section, but those which are joined together in one. Do you also give me your attention. [The words] are these: &#145;Thus saith the Lord, the God that created the heavens, and made&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2195"></A><A HREF="#fn_2195"><FONT SIZE="1">2196</FONT></A>
 them fast, that established the earth, and that which is in it; and gave breath to the people upon it, and spirit to them who walk therein: I the Lord God have called Thee in righteousness, and will hold Thine hand, and will strengthen Thee; and I have given Thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out them that are bound from the chains, and those who sit in darkness from the prison-house. I am the Lord God; this is my name: my glory will I not give to another, nor my virtues to graven images. Behold, the former things are come to pass; new things which I announce, and before they are announced they are made manifest to you. Sing unto the Lord a new song: His sovereignty [is] from the end of the earth. [Sing], ye who descend into the sea, and continually sail&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2196"></A><A HREF="#fn_2196"><FONT SIZE="1">2197</FONT></A>
 [on it]; ye islands, and inhabitants thereof. Rejoice, O wilderness, and the villages thereof, and the houses; and the inhabitants of Cedar shall rejoice, and the inhabitants of the rock shall cry aloud from the top of the mountains: they shall give glory to God; they shall publish His virtues among the islands. The Lord God of hosts shall go forth, He shall destroy war utterly, He shall stir up  <A NAME="page_231"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 231</FONT></A> <a name="viii.iv.lxv-Page_231"></A>  zeal, and He shall cry aloud to the enemies with strength.&#146; &#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2197"></A><A HREF="#fn_2197"><FONT SIZE="1">2198</FONT></A>
 And when I repeated this, I said to them, &#8220;Have you perceived, my friends, that God says He will give Him whom He has established as a light of the Gentiles, glory, and to no other; and not, as Trypho said, that God was retaining the glory to Himself?&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.lxv-p8"></A>Then Trypho answered, &#8220;We have perceived this also; pass on therefore to the remainder of the discourse.&#8221;</p>
