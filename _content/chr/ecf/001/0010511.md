### <span id="viii.iv.l-p0.1"></span>Chapter L.—It is proved from Isaiah that John is the precursor of Christ.

<span id="viii.iv.l-p1"></span>And Trypho said, “You seem to me to have
come out of a great conflict with many persons about all the points we
have been searching into, and therefore quite ready to return answers to
all questions put to you. Answer me then, first, how you can show that
there is another God besides the Maker of all things; and then you will
show, \[further\], that He submitted to be born of the Virgin.”

<span id="viii.iv.l-p2"></span>I replied, “Give me permission first of
all to quote certain passages from the prophecy of Isaiah, which refer
to the office of forerunner discharged by John the Baptist and prophet
before this our Lord Jesus Christ.”

<span id="viii.iv.l-p3"></span>“I grant it,” said he.

id="viii.iv.l-p4.2"></span><span id="viii.iv.l-p4.3"></span>Then I said,
“Isaiah thus foretold John’s forerunning: ‘And Hezekiah said to Isaiah,
Good is the word of the Lord which He spake: Let there be peace and
righteousness in my days.’ <span id="fr_2106"></span>[2107](#fn_2106)
And, ‘Encourage the people; ye priests, speak to the heart of Jerusalem,
and encourage her, because her humiliation is accomplished. Her sin is
annulled; for she has received of the Lord’s hand double for her sins. A
voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the ways of the Lord;
make straight the paths of our God. Every valley shall be filled up, and
every mountain and hill shall be brought low: and the crooked shall be
made straight, and the rough way shall be plain ways; and the glory of
the Lord shall be seen, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God:
for the Lord hath spoken it. A voice of one saying, Cry; and I said,
What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the
flower of grass. The grass has withered, and the flower of it has fallen
away; but the word of the Lord endureth for ever. Thou that bringest
good tidings to Zion, go up to the high mountain; thou that bringest
good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength. Lift ye up,
be not afraid; tell the cities of Judah, Behold your God! Behold, the
Lord comes with strength, and \[His\] arm comes with authority. Behold,
His reward is with Him, and His work before Him. As a shepherd He will
tend His flock, and will gather the lambs with \[His\] arm, and cheer on
her that is with young. Who has measured the water with \[his\] hand,
and the heaven with a span, and all the earth with \[his\] fist? Who has
weighed the mountains, and \[put\] the valleys into a balance? Who has
known the mind of the Lord? And who has been His counsellor, and who
shall advise Him? Or with whom did He take counsel, and he instructed
Him? Or who showed Him judgment? Or who made Him to know the way of
understanding? All the nations are reckoned as a drop of a bucket, and
as a turning of a balance, and shall be reckoned as spittle. But Lebanon
is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts sufficient for a
burnt-offering; and all the nations are considered nothing, and for
nothing.’ ” <span id="fr_2107"></span>[2108](#fn_2107)
