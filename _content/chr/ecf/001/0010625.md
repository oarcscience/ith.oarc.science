### <span id="viii.vi.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Testimony of Orpheus to monotheism.

<span id="viii.vi.xv-p1"></span><span id="viii.vi.xv-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.xv-p1.2"></span>At all events, we must remind you what
Orpheus, who was, as one might say, your first teacher of polytheism,
latterly addressed to his son Musæus, and to the other legitimate
auditors, concerning the one and only God. And he spoke thus:—

> <span id="viii.vi.xv-p1.3"></span>“I speak to those who lawfully may
> hear:  
> All others, ye profane, now close the doors,  
> And, O Musæus! hearken thou to me,  
> Who offspring art of the light-bringing moon:  
> The words I utter now are true indeed;  
> And if thou former thoughts of mine hast seen,  
> Let them not rob thee of the blessed life,  
> But rather turn the depths of thine own heart  
> Unto the place where light and knowledge dwell.  
> Take thou the word divine to guide thy steps,  
> And walking well in the straight certain path,  
> Look to the one and universal King—  
> One, self-begotten, and the only One,  
> Of whom all things and we ourselves are sprung.  
> All things are open to His piercing gaze,  
> While He Himself is still invisible.  
> Present in all His works, though still unseen,  
> He gives to mortals evil out of good,  
> Sending both chilling wars and tearful griefs;  
> And other than the great King there is none.  
> The clouds for ever settle round His throne,  
> And mortal eyeballs in mere mortal eyes  
> Are weak, to see Jove reigning over all.  
> He sits established in the brazen heavens  
> Upon His golden throne; under His feet  
> He treads the earth, and stretches His right hand  
> To all the ends of ocean, and around  
> Tremble the mountain ranges and the streams,  
> The depths, too, of the blue and hoary sea.”  

<span id="viii.vi.xv-p2"></span> <span id="page_280">p. 280</span> <span
id="viii.vi.xv-Page_280"></span> And again, in some other place he
says:—

> <span id="viii.vi.xv-p2.1"></span>“There is one Zeus alone, one sun,
> one hell,  
> One Bacchus; and in all things but one God;  
> Nor of all these as diverse let me speak.”  

<span id="viii.vi.xv-p3"></span>And when he swears he says:—

> <span id="viii.vi.xv-p3.1"></span>“Now I adjure thee by the highest
> heaven,  
> The work of the great God, the only wise;  
> And I adjure thee by the Father’s voice.  
> Which first He uttered when He stablished  
> The whole world by His counsel.”  

<span id="viii.vi.xv-p4"></span>What does he mean by “I adjure thee by
the Father’s voice, which first He uttered?” It is the Word of God which
he here names “the voice,” by whom heaven and earth and the whole
creation were made, as the divine prophecies of the holy men teach us;
and these he himself also paid some attention to in Egypt, and
understood that all creation was made by the Word of God; and therefore,
after he says, “I adjure thee by the Father’s voice, which first He
uttered,” he adds this besides, “when by His counsel He established the
whole world.” Here he calls the Word “voice,” for the sake of the
poetical metre. And that this is so, is manifest from the fact, that a
little further on, where the metre permits him, he names it “Word.” For
he said:—

> <span id="viii.vi.xv-p4.1"></span>“Take thou the *Word* divine to
> guide thy steps.”
