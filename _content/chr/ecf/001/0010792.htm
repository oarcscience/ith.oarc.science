<p> <a name="ix.iv.xxvi"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="ix.iv.xxvi-p0.1"></A>Chapter XXV.&#8212;This world is ruled by the providence of one God, who is both endowed with infinite justice to punish the wicked, and with infinite goodness to bless the pious, and impart to them salvation.</h3>  
<p><a name="ix.iv.xxvi-p1"></A>1. <a name="ix.iv.xxvi-p1.1"></A><a name="ix.iv.xxvi-p1.2"></A><a name="ix.iv.xxvi-p1.3"></A>God does, however, exercise a providence over all things, and therefore He also gives counsel; and when giving counsel, He is present with those who attend to moral discipline.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3786"></A><A HREF="#fn_3786"><FONT SIZE="1">3787</FONT></A>
 It follows then of course, that the things which are watched over and governed should be acquainted with their ruler; which things are not irrational or vain, but they have understanding derived from the providence of God. And, for this reason certain of the Gentiles, who were less addicted to [sensual] allurements and voluptuousness, and were not led away to such a degree of superstition with regard to idols, being moved, though but slightly, by His providence, were nevertheless convinced that they should call the Maker of this universe the Father, who exercises a providence over all things, and arranges the affairs of our world.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.iv.xxvi-p3"></A>2. <a name="ix.iv.xxvi-p3.1"></A>Again, that they might remove the rebuking and judicial power from the Father, reckoning that as unworthy of God, and thinking that they had found out a God both without anger and [merely] good, they have alleged that one [God] judges, but that another saves, unconsciously taking away the intelligence and justice of both deities. For if the judicial one is not also good, to bestow favours upon the deserving, and to direct reproofs against those requiring them, he will appear neither a just nor a wise judge. On the other hand, the good God, if he is merely good, and not one who tests those upon whom he shall send his goodness, will be out of the range of justice and goodness; and his goodness will seem imperfect, as not saving all; [for it should do so,] if it be not accompanied with judgment.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.iv.xxvi-p4"></A>3. Marcion, therefore, himself, by dividing God into two, maintaining one to be good and the other judicial, does in fact, on both sides, put an end to deity. For he that is the judicial one, if he be not good, is not God, because he from whom goodness is absent is no God at all; and again, he who is good, if he has no judicial power, suffers the same [loss] as the former, by being deprived of his character of deity. And how can they call the Father of all wise, if they do not assign to Him a judicial faculty? For if He is wise, He is also one who tests [others]; but the judicial power belongs to him who tests, and justice follows the judicial faculty, that it may reach a just conclusion; justice calls forth judgment, and judgment, when it is executed with justice, will pass on to wisdom. Therefore the Father will excel in wisdom all human and angelic wisdom, because He is Lord, and Judge, and the Just One, and Ruler over all. For He is good, and merciful, and patient, and saves whom He ought: nor does goodness desert Him in the exercise of justice,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3787"></A><A HREF="#fn_3787"><FONT SIZE="1">3788</FONT></A>
 nor is His wisdom lessened; for He saves those whom He should save, and judges those worthy of judgment. Neither does He show Himself unmercifully just; for His goodness, no doubt, goes on before, and takes precedency.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.iv.xxvi-p6"></A>4. The God, therefore, who does benevolently cause His sun to rise upon all,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3788"></A><A HREF="#fn_3788"><FONT SIZE="1">3789</FONT></A>
 and sends rain upon the just and unjust, shall judge those who, enjoying His equally distributed kindness, have led lives not corresponding to the dignity of His bounty; but who have spent their days in wantonness and luxury, in opposition to His benevolence, and have, moreover, even blasphemed Him who has conferred so great benefits upon them.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.iv.xxvi-p8"></A>5. <a name="ix.iv.xxvi-p8.1"></A>Plato is proved to be more religious than these men, for he allowed that the same God was both just and good, having power over all things, and Himself executing judgment, expressing himself thus, &#8220;And God indeed, as He is also the ancient Word, possessing the beginning, the end, and the mean of all existing things, does everything rightly, moving round about them according to their nature; but retributive justice always follows Him against those who depart from the divine law.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3789"></A><A HREF="#fn_3789"><FONT SIZE="1">3790</FONT></A>
 Then, again, he points out that the Maker and Framer of the universe is good. &#8220;And to the good,&#8221; he says, &#8220;no envy ever springs up with regard to anything;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3790"></A><A HREF="#fn_3790"><FONT SIZE="1">3791</FONT></A>
 thus establishing the goodness of God, as the beginning and the cause of the creation of the world, but not ignorance, nor an erring &AElig;on, nor the  <A NAME="page_460"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 460</FONT></A> <a name="ix.iv.xxvi-Page_460"></A>  consequence of a defect, nor the Mother weeping and lamenting, nor another God or Father.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.iv.xxvi-p11"></A>6. Well may their Mother bewail them, as capable of conceiving and inventing such things for they have worthily uttered this falsehood against themselves, that their Mother is beyond the Pleroma, that is beyond the knowledge of God, and that their entire multitude became&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3791"></A><A HREF="#fn_3791"><FONT SIZE="1">3792</FONT></A>
 a shapeless and crude abortion: for it apprehends nothing of the truth; it falls into void and darkness: for their wisdom (<i>Sophia</i>) was void, and wrapped up in darkness; and Horos did not permit her to enter the Pleroma: for the Spirit (Achamoth) did not receive them into the place of refreshment. For their father, by begetting ignorance, wrought in them the sufferings of death. We do not misrepresent [their opinions on] these points; but they do themselves confirm, they do themselves teach, they do glory in them, they imagine a lofty [mystery] about their Mother, whom they represent as having been begotten without a father, that is, without God, a female from a female,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3792"></A><A HREF="#fn_3792"><FONT SIZE="1">3793</FONT></A>
 that is, corruption from error.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.iv.xxvi-p14"></A>7. We do indeed pray that these men may not remain in the pit which they themselves have dug, but separate themselves from a Mother of this nature, and depart from Bythus, and stand away from the void, and relinquish the shadow; and that they, being converted to the Church of God, may be lawfully begotten, and that Christ may be formed in them, and that they may know the Framer and Maker of this universe, the only true God and Lord of all. We pray for these things on their behalf, loving them better than they seem to love themselves. For our love, inasmuch as it is true, is salutary to them, if they will but receive it. It may be compared to a severe remedy, extirpating the proud and sloughing flesh of a wound; for it puts an end to their pride and haughtiness. Wherefore it shall not weary us, to endeavour with all our might to stretch out the hand unto them. Over and above what has been already stated, I have deferred to the following book, to adduce the words of the Lord; if, by convincing some among them, through means of the very instruction of Christ, I may succeed in persuading them to abandon such error, and to cease from blaspheming their Creator, who is both God alone, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
