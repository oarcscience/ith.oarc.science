### <span id="ix.vii.xxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—He fortifies his opinions with regard to the temporal and earthly kingdom of the saints after their resurrection, by the various testimonies of Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and Daniel; also by the parable of the servants watching, to whom the Lord promised that He would minister.

<span id="ix.vii.xxxv-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Then, too, Isaiah himself has plainly
declared that there shall be joy of this nature at the resurrection of
the just, when he says: “The dead shall rise again; those, too, who are
in the tombs shall arise, and those who are in the earth shall rejoice.
For the dew from Thee is health to them.” <span
id="fr_4746"></span>[4747](#fn_4746) And this again Ezekiel also says:
“Behold, I will open your tombs, and will bring you forth out of your
graves; when I will draw my people from the sepulchres, and I will put
breath in you, and ye shall live; and I will place you on your own land,
and ye shall know that I am the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xxxv-p2.2"></span>Lord</span>.” <span
id="fr_4747"></span>[4748](#fn_4747) And again the same speaks thus:
“These things saith the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xxxv-p3.2"></span>Lord</span>, I will gather Israel from all
nations whither they have been driven, and I shall be sanctified in them
in the sight of the sons of the nations: and they shall dwell in their
own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob. And they shall dwell in it
in peace; and they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and dwell in
hope, when I shall cause judgment to fall among all who have dishonoured
them, among those who encircle them round about; and they shall know
that I am the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xxxv-p3.3"></span>Lord</span> their God, and the God of their
fathers.” <span id="fr_4748"></span>[4749](#fn_4748) Now I have shown a
short time ago that the church is the seed of Abraham; and for this
reason, that we may know that He who in the New Testament “raises up
from the stones children unto <span id="page_564">p. 564</span> <span
id="ix.vii.xxxv-Page_564"></span> Abraham,” <span
id="fr_4749"></span>[4750](#fn_4749) is He who will gather, according to
the Old Testament, those that shall be saved from all the nations,
Jeremiah says: “Behold, the days come, saith the <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vii.xxxv-p5.2"></span>Lord</span>, that they
shall no more say, The <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xxxv-p5.3"></span>Lord</span> liveth, who led the children of
Israel from the north, and from every region whither they had been
driven; He will restore them to their own land which He gave to their
fathers.” <span id="fr_4750"></span>[4751](#fn_4750)

<span id="ix.vii.xxxv-p7"></span>2. That the whole creation shall,
according to God’s will, obtain a vast increase, that it may bring forth
and sustain fruits such \[as we have mentioned\], Isaiah declares: “And
there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every prominent hill,
water running everywhere in that day, when many shall perish, when walls
shall fall. And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun,
seven times that of the day, when He shall heal the anguish of His
people, and do away with the pain of His stroke.” <span
id="fr_4751"></span>[4752](#fn_4751) Now “the pain of the stroke” means
that inflicted at the beginning upon disobedient man in Adam, that is,
death; which \[stroke\] the Lord will heal when He raises us from the
dead, and restores the inheritance of the fathers, as Isaiah again says:
“And thou shall be confident in the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xxxv-p8.2"></span>Lord</span>, and He will cause thee to pass
over the whole earth, and feed thee with the inheritance of Jacob thy
father.” <span id="fr_4752"></span>[4753](#fn_4752) This is what the
Lord declared: “Happy are those servants whom the Lord when He cometh
shall find watching. Verily I say unto you, that He shall gird Himself,
and make them to sit down \[to meat\], and will come forth and serve
them. And if He shall come in the evening watch, and find them so,
blessed are they, because He shall make them sit down, and minister to
them; or if this be in the second, or it be in the third, blessed are
they.” <span id="fr_4753"></span>[4754](#fn_4753) Again John also says
the very same in the Apocalypse: “Blessed and holy is he who has part in
the first resurrection.” <span id="fr_4754"></span>[4755](#fn_4754)
Then, too, Isaiah has declared the time when these events shall occur;
he says: “And I said, Lord, how long? Until the cities be wasted without
inhabitant, and the houses be without men, and the earth be left a
desert. And after these things the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xxxv-p11.2"></span>Lord</span> shall remove us men far away
(*longe nos faciet Deus homines*), and those who shall remain shall
multiply upon the earth.” <span id="fr_4755"></span>[4756](#fn_4755)
Then Daniel also says this very thing: “And the kingdom and dominion,
and the greatness of those under the heaven, is given to the saints of
the Most High God, whose kingdom is everlasting, and all dominions shall
serve and obey Him.” <span id="fr_4756"></span>[4757](#fn_4756) And lest
the promise named should be understood as referring to this time, it was
declared to the prophet: “And come thou, and stand in thy lot at the
consummation of the days.” <span id="fr_4757"></span>[4758](#fn_4757)

<span id="ix.vii.xxxv-p15"></span>3. Now, that the promises were not
announced to the prophets and the fathers alone, but to the Churches
united to these from the nations, whom also the Spirit terms “the
islands” (both because they are established in the midst of turbulence,
suffer the storm of blasphemies, exist as a harbour of safety to those
in peril, and are the refuge of those who love the height \[of heaven\],
and strive to avoid Bythus, that is, the depth of error), Jeremiah thus
declares: “Hear the word of the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xxxv-p15.1"></span>Lord</span>, ye nations, and declare it to
the isles afar off; say ye, that the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vii.xxxv-p15.2"></span>Lord</span> will scatter Israel, He will
gather him, and keep him, as one feeding his flock of sheep. For the
Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and rescued him from the hand of one stronger
than he. And they shall come and rejoice in Mount Zion, and shall come
to what is good, and into a land of wheat, and wine, and fruits, of
animals and of sheep; and their soul shall be as a tree bearing fruit,
and they shall hunger no more. At that time also shall the virgins
rejoice in the company of the young men: the old men, too, shall be
glad, and I will turn their sorrow into joy; and I will make them exult,
and will magnify them, and satiate the souls of the priests the sons of
Levi; and my people shall be satiated with my goodness.” <span
id="fr_4758"></span>[4759](#fn_4758) Now, in the preceding book <span
id="fr_4759"></span>[4760](#fn_4759) I have shown that all the disciples
of the Lord are Levites and priests, they who used in the temple to
profane the Sabbath, but are blameless. <span
id="fr_4760"></span>[4761](#fn_4760) Promises of such a nature,
therefore, do indicate in the clearest manner the feasting of that
creation in the kingdom of the righteous, which God promises that He
will Himself serve.

<span id="ix.vii.xxxv-p19"></span>4. Then again, speaking of Jerusalem,
and of Him reigning there, Isaiah declares, “Thus saith the <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vii.xxxv-p19.1"></span>Lord</span>, Happy is
he who hath seed in Zion, and servants in Jerusalem. Behold, a righteous
king shall reign, and princes shall rule with judgment.” <span
id="fr_4761"></span>[4762](#fn_4761) And with regard to the foundation
on which it shall be rebuilt, he says: “Behold, I will lay in order for
thee a carbuncle stone, and sapphire for thy foundations; and I will lay
thy ramparts with jasper, and thy gates with crystal, and thy wall with
choice stones: and all thy children shall be taught of God, and great
shall be the peace of thy children; and in righteousness shalt thou be
built up.” <span id="fr_4762"></span>[4763](#fn_4762) And yet again
<span id="page_565">p. 565</span> <span
id="ix.vii.xxxv-Page_565"></span> does he say the same thing: “Behold, I
make Jerusalem a rejoicing, and my people \[a joy\]; for the voice of
weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. Also
there shall not be there any immature \[one\], nor an old man who does
not fulfil his time: for the youth shall be of a hundred years; and the
sinner shall die a hundred years old, yet shall be accursed. And they
shall build houses, and inhabit them themselves; and shall plant
vineyards, and eat the fruit of them themselves, and shall drink wine.
And they shall not build, and others inhabit; neither shall they prepare
the vineyard, and others eat. For as the days of the tree of life shall
be the days of the people in thee; for the works of their hands shall
endure.” <span id="fr_4763"></span>[4764](#fn_4763)
