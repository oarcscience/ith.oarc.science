<p><a name="viii.iv.cxlii-p1"></A>Then Trypho, after a little delay, said, &#8220;You see that it was not intentionally that we came to discuss these points. And I confess that I have been particularly pleased with the conference; and I think that these are of quite the same opinion as myself. For we have found more than we expected, and more than it was possible to have expected. And if we could do this more frequently, we should be much helped in the searching of the Scriptures themselves. But since,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are on the eve of departure, and expect daily to set sail, do not hesitate to remember us as friends when you are gone.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.cxlii-p2"></A>&#8220;For my part,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;if I had remained, I would have wished to do the same thing daily. But now, since I expect, with God&#146;s will and aid, to set sail, I exhort you to give all diligence in this very great struggle for your own salvation, and to be earnest in setting a higher value on the Christ of the Almighty God than on your own teachers.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.cxlii-p3"></A>After this they left me, wishing me safety in my voyage, and from every misfortune. And I, praying for them, said, &#8220;I can wish no better thing for you, sirs, than this, that, recognising in this way that intelligence is given to every man, you may be of the same opinion as ourselves, and believe that Jesus is the Christ of God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2491"></A><A HREF="#fn_2491"><FONT SIZE="1">2492</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="viii.iv.cxlii-p4"></A> The last sentence is very dubious. For <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iv.cxlii-p4.1"></A>&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8054; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#957;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</span> read <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iv.cxlii-p4.2"></A>&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8054; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#8179; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#957;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</span>. For <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iv.cxlii-p4.3"></A>&#960;&#959;&#953;&#8053;&#963;&#951;&#964;&#949;</span> read <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iv.cxlii-p4.4"></A>&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#8059;&#963;&#951;&#964;&#949;</span>. And lastly, for <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iv.cxlii-p4.5"></A>&#964;&#8056; &#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> read <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iv.cxlii-p4.6"></A>&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#8125;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</span>.</p>  
<p class="endnote"><a name="viii.iv.cxlii-p5"></A>[But there is no doubt about the touching beauty of this close; and truly Trypho seems &#8220;not far from the kingdom of God.&#8221; Note the marvellous knowledge of the Old Testament Scriptures, which Justin had acquired, and which he could use in conversation. His quotations from the Psalms, <i>memoriter</i>, are more accurate than others. See Kaye, p. 141.]</p>
