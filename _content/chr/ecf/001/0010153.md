### <span id="v.iii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Do nothing without the bishop and presbyters.

<span id="v.iii.vii-p1"></span><span id="v.iii.vii-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.iii.vii-p1.2"></span>As therefore the Lord did nothing without the
Father, being united to Him, neither by Himself nor by the apostles, so
neither do ye anything without the bishop and presbyters. <span
id="v.iii.vii-p1.3"></span><span id="v.iii.vii-p1.4"></span>Neither
endeavour that anything appear reasonable and proper to yourselves
apart; but being come together into the same place, let there be one
prayer, one supplication, one mind, one hope, in love and in joy
undefiled. There is one Jesus Christ, than whom nothing is more
excellent. Do ye therefore all run together as into one temple of God,
as to one altar, as to one Jesus Christ, who came forth from one Father,
and is with and has gone to one.

<span id="v.iii.vii-p2"></span><span id="v.iii.vii-p2.1"></span><span
id="v.iii.vii-p2.2"></span>As therefore the Lord does nothing without
the Father, for says He, “I can of mine own self do nothing,” <span
id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673) so do ye, neither presbyter, nor
deacon, nor layman, do anything without the bishop. Nor let anything
appear commendable to you which is destitute of his approval. <span
id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674) For every such thing is sinful, and
opposed \[to the will of\] God. <span id="v.iii.vii-p4.1"></span><span
id="v.iii.vii-p4.2"></span>Do ye all come together into the same place
for prayer. Let there be one common supplication, one mind, one hope,
with faith unblameable in Christ Jesus, than which nothing is more
excellent. Do ye all, as one man, run together into the temple of God,
as unto one altar, to one Jesus Christ, the High Priest of the
unbegotten God.
