### <span id="iii.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—The manners of the Christians.

<span id="iii.ii.v-p1"></span><span id="iii.ii.v-p1.1"></span>For the
Christians are distinguished from other men neither by country, nor
language, nor the customs which they observe. For they neither inhabit
cities of their own, nor employ a peculiar form of speech, nor lead a
life which is marked out by any singularity. The course of conduct which
they follow has not been devised by any speculation or deliberation of
inquisitive men; nor do they, like some, proclaim themselves the
advocates of any merely human doctrines. But, inhabiting Greek as well
as barbarian cities, according as the lot of each of them has
determined, and following the customs of the natives in respect to
clothing, food, and the rest of their ordinary conduct, they display to
us their wonderful and confessedly striking <span
id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280) method of life. They dwell in their
own countries, but simply as sojourners. As citizens, they share in all
things with others, and yet endure all things as if foreigners. Every
foreign land is to them as their native country, and every land of their
birth as a land of strangers. <span id="iii.ii.v-p2.1"></span><span
id="iii.ii.v-p2.2"></span>They marry, as do all \[others\]; they beget
children; but they do not destroy their offspring. <span
id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281) They <span id="page_27">p. 27</span>
<span id="iii.ii.v-Page_27"></span> have a common table, but not a
common bed. <span id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282) They are in the
flesh, but they do not live after the flesh. <span
id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283) They pass their days on earth, but
they are citizens of heaven. <span id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284)
They obey the prescribed laws, and at the same time surpass the laws by
their lives. They love all men, and are persecuted by all. They are
unknown and condemned; they are put to death, and restored to
life. <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285) They are poor, yet make
many rich; <span id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286) they are in lack of
all things, and yet abound in all; they are dishonoured, and yet in
their very dishonour are glorified. They are evil spoken of, and yet are
justified; they are reviled, and bless; <span
id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287) they are insulted, and repay the
insult with honour; they do good, yet are punished as evil-doers. When
punished, they rejoice as if quickened into life; they are assailed by
the Jews as foreigners, and are persecuted by the Greeks; yet those who
hate them are unable to assign any reason for their hatred.
