### <span id="v.xi.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="v.xi.ix-p1"></span><span id="v.xi.ix-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.xi.ix-p1.2"></span>There was concealed from the ruler of this
world the virginity of Mary and the birth of our Lord, and the three
renowned mysteries <span id="fr_1157"></span>[1158](#fn_1157) which were
done in the tranquillity of God from the star. And here, at the
manifestation of the Son, magic began to be destroyed, and all bonds
were loosed; and the ancient kingdom and the error of evil was
destroyed. Henceforward all things were moved together, and the
destruction of death was devised, and there was the commencement of that
which was perfected in God. <span id="fr_1158"></span>[1159](#fn_1158)

<span id="v.xi.ix-p2"></span> Literally, “the mysteries of the shout.”
The meaning is here confused and obscure. See the Greek.

<span id="v.xi.ix-p3"></span> Chaps. xx. and xxi. of the Greek are
altogether wanting in the Syriac. \[N.B.—See spurious Epistle to
Philippians, cap. 4, *infra*. This concealment from Satan of the mystery
of the incarnation is the explanation, according to the Fathers, of his
tempting the Messiah, and prompting His crucifixion. Also, Christ the
more profoundly humbled himself, “*ne subtilis ille diaboli oculus
magnum hoc pietatis deprehenderet sacramentum*” (St. Bernard, opp. ii.
1944). Bernard also uses this opinion very strikingly (opp. ii. 1953) in
one of his sermons, supposing that Satan discovered the secret too late
for his own purpose, and then prompted the outcry, *Come down from the
cross*, to defeat the triumph of the second Adam. (Comp. St. [Mark i.
24](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024)<span id="v.xi.ix-p3.1"></span> and
St. [Luke iv. 34](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#034)<span
id="v.xi.ix-p3.2"></span>, where, after the first defeat of the tempter,
this demon suspects the second Adam, and tries to extort the secret).\]
