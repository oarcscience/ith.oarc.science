### <span id="v.iv.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—I have need of humility.

<span id="v.iv.iv-p1"></span><span id="v.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>I have great
knowledge in God, <span id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744) but I restrain
myself, lest, I should perish through boasting. For now it is needful
for me to be the more fearful; and not give heed to those that puff me
up. For they that speak to me \[in the way of commendation\] scourge me.
For I do indeed desire to suffer, but I know not if I be worthy to do
so. For this longing, though it is not manifest to many, all the more
vehemently assails me. <span id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745) I
therefore have need of meekness, by which the prince of this world is
brought to nought.

<span id="v.iv.iv-p4"></span><span id="v.iv.iv-p4.1"></span>But I
measure myself, that I may not perish through boasting: but it is good
to glory in the Lord. <span id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746) And even
though I were established <span id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747) in
things pertaining to God, yet then would it befit me to be the more
fearful, and not give heed to those that vainly puff me up. For those
that commend me scourge me. \[I do indeed desire to suffer <span
id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748) \], but I know not if I be worthy to
do so. <span id="v.iv.iv-p7.2"></span>For the envy of the wicked one is
not visible to many, but it wars against me. I therefore have need of
meekness, by which the devil, the prince of this world, is brought to
nought.
