### <span id="ix.vii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—When Christ visited us in His grace, He did not come to what did not belong to Him: also, by shedding His true blood for us, and exhibiting to us His true flesh in the Eucharist, He conferred upon our flesh the capacity of salvation.

<span id="ix.vii.iii-p1"></span>1. And vain likewise are those who say
that <span id="page_528">p. 528</span> <span
id="ix.vii.iii-Page_528"></span> God came to those things which did not
belong to Him, as if covetous of another’s property; in order that He
might deliver up that man who had been created by another, to that God
who had neither made nor formed anything, but who also was deprived from
the beginning of His own proper formation of men. <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p1.1"></span>The advent, therefore, of Him whom these men
represent as coming to the things of others, was not righteous; nor did
He truly redeem us by His own blood, if He did not really become man,
restoring to His own handiwork what was said \[of it\] in the beginning,
that man was made after the image and likeness of God; not snatching
away by stratagem the property of another, but taking possession of His
own in a righteous and gracious manner. As far as concerned the
apostasy, indeed, He redeems us righteously from it by His own blood;
but as regards us who have been redeemed, \[He does this\] graciously.
For we have given nothing to Him previously, nor does He desire anything
from us, as if He stood in need of it; but we do stand in need of
fellowship with Him. And for this reason it was that He graciously
poured Himself out, that He might gather us into the bosom of the
Father.

<span id="ix.vii.iii-p2"></span>2. <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p2.1"></span><span id="ix.vii.iii-p2.2"></span>But vain
in every respect are they who despise the entire dispensation of God,
and disallow the salvation of the flesh, and treat with contempt its
regeneration, maintaining that it is not capable of incorruption. But if
this indeed do not attain salvation, then neither did the Lord redeem us
with His blood, nor is the cup of the Eucharist the communion of His
blood, nor the bread which we break the communion of His body. <span
id="fr_4457"></span>[4458](#fn_4457) For blood can only come from veins
and flesh, and whatsoever else makes up the substance of man, such as
the Word of God was actually made. By His own blood he redeemed us, as
also His apostle declares, “In whom we have redemption through His
blood, even the remission of sins.” <span
id="fr_4458"></span>[4459](#fn_4458) And as we are His members, we are
also nourished by means of the creation (and He Himself grants the
creation to us, for He causes His sun to rise, and sends rain when He
wills <span id="fr_4459"></span>[4460](#fn_4459) ). He has acknowledged
the cup (which is a part of the creation) as His own blood, from which
He bedews our blood; and the bread (also a part of the creation) He has
established as His own body, from which He gives increase to our
bodies. <span id="fr_4460"></span>[4461](#fn_4460)

<span id="ix.vii.iii-p7"></span>3. <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p7.1"></span><span id="ix.vii.iii-p7.2"></span><span
id="ix.vii.iii-p7.3"></span>When, therefore, the mingled cup and the
manufactured bread receives the Word of God, and the Eucharist of the
blood and the body of Christ is made, <span
id="fr_4461"></span>[4462](#fn_4461) from which things the substance of
our flesh is increased and supported, how can they affirm that the flesh
is incapable of receiving the gift of God, which is life eternal, which
\[flesh\] is nourished from the body and blood of the Lord, and is a
member of Him?—even as the blessed Paul declares in his Epistle to the
Ephesians, that “we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His
bones.” <span id="fr_4462"></span>[4463](#fn_4462) He does not speak
these words of some spiritual and invisible man, for a spirit has not
bones nor flesh; <span id="fr_4463"></span>[4464](#fn_4463) but \[he
refers to\] that dispensation \[by which the Lord became\] an actual
man, consisting of flesh, and nerves, and bones,—that \[flesh\] which is
nourished by the cup which is His blood, and receives increase from the
bread which is His body. And just as a cutting from the vine planted in
the ground fructifies in its season, or as a corn of wheat falling into
the earth and becoming decomposed, rises with manifold increase by the
Spirit of God, who contains all things, and then, through the wisdom of
God, serves for the use of men, and having received the Word of God,
becomes the Eucharist, which is the body and blood of Christ; so also
our bodies, being nourished by it, and deposited in the earth, and
suffering decomposition there, shall rise at their appointed time, the
Word of God granting them resurrection to the glory of God, even the
Father, who freely gives to this mortal immortality, and to this
corruptible incorruption, <span id="fr_4464"></span>[4465](#fn_4464)
because the strength of God is made perfect in weakness, <span
id="fr_4465"></span>[4466](#fn_4465) in order that we may never become
puffed up, as if we had life from ourselves, and exalted against God,
our minds becoming ungrateful; but learning by experience that we
possess eternal duration from the excelling power of this Being, not
from our own nature, we may neither undervalue that glory which
surrounds God as He is, nor be ignorant of our own nature, but that we
may know what God can effect, and what benefits man receives, and thus
never wander from the true comprehension of things as they are, that is,
both with regard to God and with regard to man. And might it not be the
case, perhaps, as I have already observed, that for this purpose God
permitted our resolution into the common dust of mortality, <span
id="fr_4466"></span>[4467](#fn_4466) that we, being instructed by every
mode, may be accurate in all things for the future, being ignorant
neither of God nor of ourselves?
