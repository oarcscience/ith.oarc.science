### <span id="viii.iv.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.—The Jews violate the eternal law, and interpret ill that of Moses.

<span id="viii.iv.xii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xii-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xii-p1.3"></span>I also adduced another passage in which
Isaiah exclaims: “ ‘Hear My words, and your soul shall live; and I will
make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.
Behold, I have given Him for a witness to the people: nations which know
not Thee shall call on Thee; peoples who know not Thee shall escape to
Thee, because of thy God, the Holy One of Israel; for He has glorified
Thee.’ <span id="fr_1970"></span>[1971](#fn_1970) This same law you have
despised, and His new holy covenant you have slighted; and now you
neither receive it, nor repent of your evil deeds. ‘For your ears are
closed, your eyes are blinded, and the heart is hardened,’
Jeremiah <span id="fr_1971"></span>[1972](#fn_1971) has cried; yet not
even then do you listen. The Lawgiver is present, yet you do not see
Him; to the poor the Gospel is preached, the blind see, yet you do not
understand. You have now need of a second circumcision, though you glory
greatly in the flesh. The new law requires you to keep perpetual
sabbath, and you, because you are idle for one day, suppose you are
pious, not discerning why this has been commanded you: and if you eat
unleavened bread, you say the will of God has been fulfilled. The Lord
our God does not take pleasure in such observances: if there is any
perjured person or a thief among you, let him cease to be so; if any
adulterer, let him repent; then he has kept the sweet and true sabbaths
of God. If any one has impure hands, let him wash and be pure.
