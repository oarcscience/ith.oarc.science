#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xiv-p1"></span>Nothing escapes God’s knowledge. This
is proved by the witness of the Scriptures and the analogy of the sun,
which, although created, yet by its light or heat enters into all
things.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xiv-p2"></span>51. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xiv-p2.1"></span>Next</span> comes the answer to the
question, whether God, not having failed to show care for His work, now
fails to have knowledge of it? Thus it is written: “He that planted the
ear, shall He not hear? He that made the eye, shall He not
regard?” <span id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xiv-p4"></span>52. This false idea was not unknown to
the holy prophets. David himself introduces men to speak whom pride has
filled and claimed for its own. For what shows greater pride than when
men who are living in sin think it unfit that other sinners should live,
and say: “Lord, how long shall the ungodly, how long shall the ungodly
<span id="page_10">p. 10</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.xiv-Page_10"></span>triumph?” <span
id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88) And later on: “And yet they say, the Lord
shall not see: neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.” <span
id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89) Whom the prophet answers, saying: “Take
heed, ye unwise among the people: O ye fools, when will ye understand?
He that planted the ear, shall He not hear? or He that made the eye,
shall He not see? He that rebuketh the nations, shall He not punish?—He
that teacheth man knowledge? The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man that
they are vain.” <span id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90) Does He Who
discerns whatsoever is vain not know what is holy, and is He ignorant of
what He Himself has made? Can the workman be ignorant of his own work?
This one is a man, yet he discerns what is hidden in his work; and
God—shall He not know His own work? Is there more depth, then, in the
work than in its author? Has He made something superior to Himself; the
value of which, as its Author, He was ignorant of, and whose condition
He knew not, though He was its Director? So much for these persons.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xiv-p8"></span>53. But we are satisfied with the
witness of Him Who says: “I search out the heart and the reins.” <span
id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91) In the Gospel, also, the Lord Jesus says:
“Why think ye evil in your hearts? For He knew they were thinking
evil.” <span id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92) The evangelist also
witnesses to this, saying: “For Jesus knew their thoughts.” <span
id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xiv-p12"></span>54. The idea of these people will not
trouble us much if we look at their actions. They will not have Him to
be judge over them, Whom nothing deceives; they will not grant to Him
the knowledge of things hidden, for they are afraid their own hidden
things may be brought to light. But the Lord, also, “knowing their
works, has given them over unto darkness. In the night,” he says, “he
will be as a thief, and the eye of the adulterer will watch for the
darkness, saying, No eye shall see me; he hath covered up his
face.” <span id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94) For every one that avoids
the light loves darkness, seeking to be hid, though he cannot be hid
from God, Who knows not only what is transacted, but also what will be
thought of, both in the depths of space and in the minds of men. Thus,
again, he who speaks in the book Ecclesiasticus says: “Who seeth me? The
darkness hath covered me, and the walls have hidden me; whom do I
fear?” <span id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95) But although lying on his
bed he may think thus, he is caught where he never thought of it. “It
shall be,” it says, “a shame to him because he knew not what the fear of
the Lord was.” <span id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xiv-p16"></span>55. But what can be more foolish than
to suppose that anything escapes God’s notice, when the sun which
supplies the light enters even hidden spots, and the strength of its
heat reaches to the foundations of a house and its inner chambers? Who
can deny that the depths of the earth, which the winter’s ice has bound
together, are warmed by the mildness of spring? Surely the very heart of
a tree feels the force of heat or cold, to such an extent that its roots
are either nipped with the cold or sprout forth in the warmth of the
sun. In short, wherever the mildness of heaven smiles on the earth,
there the earth produces in abundance fruits of different kinds.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xiv-p17"></span>56. If, then, the sun’s rays pour
their light over all the earth and enter into its hidden spots; if they
cannot be checked by iron bars or the barrier of heavy doors from
getting within, how can it be impossible for the Glory of God, which is
instinct with life, to enter into the thoughts and hearts of men that He
Himself has created? And how shall it not see what He Himself has
created? Did He make His works to be better and more powerful than He
Himself is, Who made them (in this event) so as to escape the notice of
their Creator whensoever they will? Did He implant such perfection and
power in our mind that He Himself could not comprehend it when He
wished?
