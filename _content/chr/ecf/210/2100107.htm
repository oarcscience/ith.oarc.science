<p> <a name="iv.i.iv.xiii"></A> <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.i.iv.xiii-p0.1"></A>Chapter XIII.</h4>  
<p class="c32"><a name="iv.i.iv.xiii-p1"></A>Judith, after enduring many dangers for virtue&#146;s sake, gained very many and great benefits.</p>  
<p class="c22"><a name="iv.i.iv.xiii-p2"></A>82. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.i.iv.xiii-p2.1"></A>See</span>! Judith presents herself to thee as worthy of admiration. She approaches Holophernes, a man feared by the people, and surrounded by the victorious troops of the Assyrians. At first she makes an impression on him by the grace of her form and the beauty of her countenance. Then she entraps him by the refinement of her speech. Her first triumph was that she returned from the tent of the enemy with her purity unspotted.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_688"></A><A HREF="#fn_688"><FONT SIZE="1">689</FONT></A>
 Her second, that she gained a victory over a man, and put to flight the people by her counsel.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.i.iv.xiii-p4"></A>83. The Persians were terrified at her daring.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_689"></A><A HREF="#fn_689"><FONT SIZE="1">690</FONT></A>
 And so what is admired in the case of those two Pythagoreans deserves also in her case our admiration, for she trembled not at the danger of death, nor even at the danger her modesty was in, which is a matter of greater concern to good women. She feared not the blow of one scoundrel, nor even the weapons of a whole army. She, a woman, stood between the lines of the combatants&#8212;right amidst victorious arms&#8212;heedless of death. As one looks at her overwhelming danger, one would say she went out to die; as one looks at her faith, one says she went but out to fight.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.i.iv.xiii-p6"></A>84. Judith then followed the call of virtue, and as she follows that, she wins great benefits. It was virtuous to prevent the people of the Lord from giving themselves up to the heathen; to prevent them from betraying their native rites and mysteries, or from yielding up their consecrated virgins, their venerable widows, and modest matrons to barbarian impurity, or from ending the siege by a surrender. It was virtuous for her to be willing to encounter danger on behalf of all, so as to deliver all from danger.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.i.iv.xiii-p7"></A>85. How great must have been the power of her virtue, that she, a woman, should claim to give counsel on the chiefest matters and not leave it in the hands of the leaders of the people! How great, again, the power of her virtue to reckon for certain upon God to help her! How great her grace to find His help!</p>

<A HREF="2100108">Next: Chapter XIV. How virtuous and useful was that which Elisha did. This is compared with that oft-recounted act of the Greeks. John gave up his life for virtue's sake, and Susanna for the same reason exposed herself to the danger of death.</A></CENTER>
