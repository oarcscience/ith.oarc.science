<p> <a name="iv.vi.iii.ix"></A> <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p0.1"></A>Chapter IX.</h4>  
<p class="c32"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p1"></A>In what way faith is necessary for repentance. Means for paying our debts, in which work, prayer, tears, and fasting are of more value than money. Some instances are adduced, and St. Ambrose declares that generosity is profitable, but only when joined with faith; it is, moreover, liable to certain defects. He goes on to speak of some defects in repentance, such as too great haste in seeking reconciliation, considering abstinence from sacraments all that is needed, of committing sin in hope of repenting later.</p>  
<p class="c22"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p2"></A>80. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p2.1"></A>So</span>, then, it is fitting for us to believe both that sinners must repent and that forgiveness is to be given on repentance, yet still as hoping for forgiveness as granted upon faith, not as a debt, for it is one thing to earn, and another presumptuously to claim a right. Faith asks for forgiveness, as it were, by covenant, but presumption is more akin to demand than to request. Pay first that which you owe, that you may be in a position to ask for what you have hoped. Come with the disposition of an honest debtor, that you may not contract a fresh liability, but may pay that which is due of the existing debt with the possessions of your faith.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p3"></A>81. He who owes a debt to God has more help towards payment than he who is indebted to man. Man requires money for money, and this is not always at the debtor&#146;s command. God demands the affection of the heart, which is in our own power. No one who owes a debt to God is poor, except one who has made himself poor. And even if he have nothing to sell, yet has he wherewith to pay. Prayer, fasting, and tears are the resources of an honest debtor, and much more abundant than if one from the price of his estate offered money without faith.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p4"></A>82. Ananias was poor, when after selling his land he brought the money to the  <A NAME="page_356"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 356</FONT></A> <a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-Page_356"></A>apostles, and was not able with it to pay his debt, but involved himself the more.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3135"></A><A HREF="#fn_3135"><FONT SIZE="1">3136</FONT></A>
 That widow was rich who cast her two small pieces into the treasury, of whom Christ said: &#8220;This poor widow hath cast in more than they all.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3136"></A><A HREF="#fn_3136"><FONT SIZE="1">3137</FONT></A>
 For God requires not money but faith.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p7"></A>83. And I do not deny that sins may be diminished by liberal gifts to the poor, but only if faith commend what is spent. For what would the giving of one&#146;s whole property benefit without charity?</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p8"></A>84. There are some who aim at the credit of generosity for pride alone, because they wish thereby to gain the good opinion of the multitude for leaving nothing to themselves; but whilst they are seeking rewards in this life, they are laying up none for the life to come, and having received their reward here they cannot hope for it there.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p9"></A>85. Some again, having, through impulsive excitement and not after long consideration, given their possessions to the Church, think that they can claim them back. These gain neither the first nor the second reward, for the gift was made thoughtlessly, its recall sacrilegiously.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p10"></A>86. Some repent of having distributed their property to the poor. But they who are doing penance must not repent of this, lest they repent of their own repentance. For many seek for penance through fear of future punishment, being conscious of their sins, and having received their penance are held back by fear of the public entreaties. These persons seem to have sought for repentance for their evil deeds, but to exercise it for their good ones.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p11"></A>87. Some seek penance because they wish to be at once restored to communion. These wish not so much to loose themselves as to bind the priest, for they do not put off the guilt from their own conscience, but lay it on that of the priest, to whom the command is given: &#8220;Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the swine;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3137"></A><A HREF="#fn_3137"><FONT SIZE="1">3138</FONT></A>
 that is to say, that partaking of the holy Communion is not to be allowed to those polluted with impurity.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p13"></A>88. And so one may see those walking in other attire, who ought to be weeping and groaning because they had defiled the robe of sanctification and grace; and women loading their ears with pearls, and weighing down their necks, who had better have bent to Christ than to gold, and who ought to be weeping for themselves, because they have lost the pearl from heaven.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p14"></A>89. There are, again, some who think that it is penitence to abstain from the heavenly sacraments. These are too cruel judges of themselves, who prescribe a penalty for themselves but refuse the remedy, who ought to be mourning over their self-imposed penalty, because it deprives them of heavenly grace.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p15"></A>90. Others think that licence is granted them to sin, because the hope of penitence is before them, whereas penitence is the remedy, not an incentive to sin. For the salve is necessary for the wound, not the wound for the salve, since a salve is sought because of the wound, the wound is not wished for on account of the salve. The hope which is put off to a future season is but feeble, for every season is uncertain, and hope does not outlive all time.</p>

<A HREF="2100315.htm">Next: Chapter X. In order to do away with the feeling of shame which holds back the guilty from public penance, St. Ambrose points out the advantage of prayers offered by the whole Church, and sets forth the example of saints who have sorrowed. Then, after reproving those who imagine that penance may be often repeated, he points out the difficulty of repentance, and how it is to be carried out.</A></CENTER>
