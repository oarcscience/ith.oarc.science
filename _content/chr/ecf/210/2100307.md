#### <span id="iv.vi.iii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.ii-p1"></span>*A passage quoted by the heretics
against repentance is explained in two ways, the first being that* <span
id="iv.vi.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>*[Heb. vi.
4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004)<span id="iv.vi.iii.ii-p1.2"></span>*
*refers to the impossibility of being baptized again; the second, that
what is impossible with man is possible with God.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.ii-p2"></span>6. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.ii-p2.1"></span>Being</span> then refuted by the clear
example of the Apostle and by his writings, the heretics yet endeavour
to resist further, and say that their opinion is supported by apostolic
authority, bringing forward the passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews:
“For it is impossible that those who were once enlightened, and have
tasted the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy
Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the
world to come, should if they fall away be again renewed unto
repentance, crucifying again the Son of God, and put Him to open
shame.” <span id="fr_3056"></span>[3057](#fn_3056)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.ii-p4"></span>7. Could Paul teach in opposition to
his own act? He had at Corinth forgiven sin through penance, how could
he himself speak against his own decision? Since, then, he could not
destroy what he had built, we must assume that what he says was
different from, but not contrary to, what had gone before. For what is
contrary is opposed to itself, what is different has ordinarily another
meaning. Things which are contrary are not such that one can support the
other. Inasmuch, then, as the Apostle spoke of remitting penance, he
could not be silent as to those who thought that baptism was to be
repeated. And it was right first of all to remove our anxiety, and to
let us know that even after baptism, if any sinned their sins <span
id="page_346">p. 346</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iii.ii-Page_346"></span>could be forgiven them, lest a false
belief in a reiterated baptism should lead astray those who were
destitute of all hope of forgiveness. And secondly, it was right to set
forth in a well-reasoned argument that baptism is not to be repeated.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.ii-p5"></span>8. And that the writer was speaking of
baptism is evident from the very words in which it is stated that it is
impossible to renew unto repentance those who were fallen, inasmuch as
we are renewed by means of the laver of baptism, whereby we are born
again, as Paul says himself: “For we are buried with Him through baptism
into death, that, like as Christ rose from the dead through the glory of
the Father, so we, too, should walk in newness of life.” <span
id="fr_3057"></span>[3058](#fn_3057) And in another place: “Be ye
renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new man which is
created after God.” <span id="fr_3058"></span>[3059](#fn_3058) And
elsewhere again: “Thy youth shall be renewed like the eagle,” <span
id="fr_3059"></span>[3060](#fn_3059) because the eagle after death is
born again from its ashes, as we being dead in sin are through the
Sacrament of Baptism born again to God, and created anew. So, then, here
as elsewhere, he teaches one baptism. “One faith,” he says, “one
baptism.” <span id="fr_3060"></span>[3061](#fn_3060)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.ii-p10"></span>9. This, too, is plain, that in him
who is baptized the Son of God is crucified, for our flesh could not do
away sin unless it were crucified in Jesus Christ. And then it is
written that: “All we who were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
into His death.” <span id="fr_3061"></span>[3062](#fn_3061) And farther
on: “If we have been planted in the likeness of His death, we shall be
also in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing that our old man was
fastened with Him to His cross.” <span
id="fr_3062"></span>[3063](#fn_3062) And to the Colossians he says:
“Buried with Him by baptism, wherein ye also rose again with Him.” <span
id="fr_3063"></span>[3064](#fn_3063) Which was written to the intent
that we should believe that He is crucified in us, that our sins may be
purged through Him, that He, Who alone can forgive sins, may nail to His
cross the handwriting which was against us. <span
id="fr_3064"></span>[3065](#fn_3064) In us He triumphs over
principalities and powers, as it is written of Him: “He made a show of
principalities and powers, triumphing over them in Himself.” <span
id="fr_3065"></span>[3066](#fn_3065)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.ii-p16"></span>10. So, then, that which he says in
this Epistle to the Hebrews, that it is impossible for those who have
fallen to be “renewed unto repentance, crucifying again the Son of God,
and putting Him to open shame,” must be considered as having reference
to baptism, wherein we crucify the Son of God in ourselves, that the
world may be by Him crucified for us, who triumph, as it were, when we
take to ourselves the likeness of His death, who put to open shame upon
His cross principalities and powers, and triumphed over them, that in
the likeness of His death we, too, might triumph over the principalities
whose yoke we throw off. But Christ was crucified once, and died to sin
once, and so there is but one, not several baptisms.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.ii-p17"></span>11. But what of the passage wherein
the doctrine of baptisms is spoken of? Because under the Law there were
many baptisms or washings, he rightly rebukes those who forsake what is
perfect and seek again the first principles of the word. He teaches us
that the whole of the washings under the Law are done away with, and
that there is one baptism in the sacraments of the Church. But he
exhorts us that leaving the first principles of the word we should go on
to perfection. “And this,” he says, “we will do, if God permits,” <span
id="fr_3066"></span>[3067](#fn_3066) for no one can be perfect without
the grace of God.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.ii-p19"></span>12. And indeed I might also say to
any one who thought that this passage spoke of repentance, that things
which are impossible with men are possible with God; and God is able
whensoever He wills to forgive us our sins, even those which we think
cannot be forgiven. And so it is possible for God to give us that which
it seems to us impossible to obtain. For it seemed impossible that water
should wash away sin, and Naaman the Syrian <span
id="fr_3067"></span>[3068](#fn_3067) thought that his leprosy could not
be cleansed by water. But that which was impossible God made to be
possible, Who gave us so great grace. In like manner it seemed
impossible that sins should be forgiven through repentance, but Christ
gave this power to His apostles, which has been transmitted to the
priestly office. That, then, has become possible which was impossible.
But, by a true reasoning, he convinces us that the reiteration by any
one of the Sacrament of Baptism is not permitted.
