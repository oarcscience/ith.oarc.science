<span id="iv.vi.ii.viii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.viii-p1"></span>It was the Lord’s will to confer
great gifts on His disciples. Further, the Novatians confute themselves
by the practices of laying on of hands and of baptism, since it is by
the same power that sins are remitted in penance and in baptism. Their
conduct is then contrasted with that of our Lord.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.viii-p2"></span>34. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.viii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is the will of the Lord that
His disciples should possess great powers; it is His will that the same
things which He did when on earth should be done in His Name by His
servants. For He said: “Ye shall do greater things than these.” <span
id="fr_2955"></span>[2956](#fn_2955) He gave them power to raise the
dead. And whereas He could Himself have restored to Saul the use of his
sight, He nevertheless sent him to His disciple Ananias, that by his
blessing Saul’s eyes might be restored, the sight of which he had
lost. <span id="fr_2956"></span>[2957](#fn_2956) Peter also He bade walk
with Himself on the sea, and because he faltered He blamed him for
lessening the grace given him by the weakness of his faith. <span
id="fr_2957"></span>[2958](#fn_2957) He Who Himself was the light of the
world granted to His disciples to be the light of the world through
grace. <span id="fr_2958"></span>[2959](#fn_2958) And because He
purposed to descend from heaven and to ascend thither again, He took up
Elijah into heaven to restore him again to earth at the time which
should please Him. And being baptized with the Holy Spirit and with
fire, He foreshadowed the Sacrament of Baptism at the hands of
John. <span id="fr_2959"></span>[2960](#fn_2959)

<span id="iv.vi.ii.viii-p8"></span>35. And in fine He gave all gifts to
His disciples, of whom He said: “In My Name they shalt cast out devils;
they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if
they shall drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay
hands on the sick, and they shall do well.” <span
id="fr_2960"></span>[2961](#fn_2960) So, then, He gave them all things,
but there is no power of man exercised in these things, in which the
grace of the divine gift operates.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.viii-p10"></span>36. Why, then, do you lay on hands,
and believe it to be the effect of the blessing, if perchance some sick
person recovers? Why do you assume that any can be cleansed by you from
the pollution of the devil? Why do you baptize if sins cannot be
remitted by man? If baptism is certainly the remission of all sins, what
difference does it make whether priests claim that this power is given
to them in penance or at the font? In each the mystery is one.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.viii-p11"></span>37. But you say that the grace of
the mysteries works in the font. What works, then, in penance? Does not
the Name of God do the work? What then? Do you, when you choose, claim
for yourselves the grace of God, and when you choose reject it? But this
is a mark of insolent presumption, not of holy fear, when those who wish
to do penance are despised by you. You cannot, forsooth, endure the
tears of the weepers; your eyes cannot bear the coarse clothing, the
filth of the squalid; with proud eyes and puffed-up hearts you delicate
ones say with angry tones, “Touch me not, for I am pure.”

<span id="iv.vi.ii.viii-p12"></span>38. The Lord said indeed to Mary
Magdalene, “Touch Me not,” <span id="fr_2961"></span>[2962](#fn_2961)
but He Who was pure did not say, “because I am pure.” Do you, Novatian,
dare to call yourself pure, whilst, even if you were pure as regards
your acts, you would be made impure by this saying alone? Isaiah says:
“O wretched that I am, and pricked to the heart; for that being a man,
and having unclean lips, I dwell also in the midst of a people having
unclean lips,” <span id="fr_2962"></span>[2963](#fn_2962) and do you
say, “I am clean,” when, as it is written, not even an infant of a day
old is pure? <span id="fr_2963"></span>[2964](#fn_2963) David says, “And
cleanse me from my sin,” <span id="fr_2964"></span>[2965](#fn_2964) whom
for his tender heart the grace of God often cleansed; are you pure who
are so unrighteous as to have no tenderness, as to see the mote in your
brother’s eye, but not to consider the beam which is in your own eye?
For with God no one who is unjust is pure. And what is more unjust than
to desire to have your sins forgiven you, and yet yourself to think that
he who entreats you ought not to be forgiven? What is more unjust than
to justify yourself in that wherein you condemn another, whilst you
yourself are committing worse offences?

<span id="iv.vi.ii.viii-p17"></span>39. Then, too, the Lord Jesus when
about to consecrate <span id="fr_2965"></span>[2966](#fn_2965) the
forgiveness of our sins replied to John, who said: “I ought to be
baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me? Suffer it now, for thus it
becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.” <span
id="fr_2966"></span>[2967](#fn_2966) And the Lord indeed came to a
sinner, though indeed He had no sin, and desired to be baptized, having
no need of cleansing; who, then, can tolerate you, who think there is no
need for you to be cleansed by penance, because you say you are cleansed
by grace, as though it were now impossible for you to sin?

[Next: Chapter IX. By collating similar passages with 1 Sam. iii. 25,
St. Ambrose shows that the meaning is not that no one shall intercede,
but that the intercessor must be worthy as were Moses and Jeremiah, at
whose prayers we read that God spared Israel.](2100296)
