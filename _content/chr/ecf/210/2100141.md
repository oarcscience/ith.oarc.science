#### <span id="iv.ii.iii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.iv-p1"></span>As to know the Father and the Son is
life, so is it life to know the Holy Spirit; and therefore in the
Godhead He is not to be separated from the Father.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.iv-p2"></span>26. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.iv-p2.1"></span>Let</span> them say, then, wherein they
think that there is an unlikeness in the divine operation. Since as to
know the Father and the Son is life, as the Lord Himself declared,
saying: “This is life eternal to know Thee the only true God, and Jesus
Christ, Whom Thou hast sent,” <span id="fr_1041"></span>[1042](#fn_1041)
so, too, to know the Holy Spirit is life. For the Lord said: “If ye love
Me, keep My commandments, and I will ask the Father and He shall give
you another Paraclete, that He may abide with you for ever, even the
Spirit of Truth, Whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him
not, neither knoweth Him, but ye know Him, for He is with you, and in
you.” <span id="fr_1042"></span>[1043](#fn_1042)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.iv-p5"></span>27. So, then, the world had not
eternal life, because it had not received the Spirit; for where the
Spirit is, there is eternal life; for the Spirit Himself it is Who
effects eternal life. Wherefore I wonder why the Arians stir the
question as to the only true God. For as it is eternal life to know the
only true God, so, too, is it eternal life to know Jesus Christ; so,
again, it is eternal life to know the Holy Spirit, Whom, as also the
Father, the world does not see, and, as also the Son, does not know. But
he who is not of this world has eternal life, and the Spirit, Who is the
Light of eternal life, remains with him for ever.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.iv-p6"></span>28. If the knowledge of the only true
God confers the same benefit as the knowledge of the Son and of the
Spirit, why do you sever the Son and the Spirit from the honour of the
true God, when you do not sever Him from conferring the benefit? For of
necessity you must either believe that this is the greatest gift of the
only true Godhead, and will confess the only true Godhead as of the
Father, so also of the Son and of the Holy Spirit; or if you say that
he, too, can give life eternal who is not true God, it will happen that
you derogate rather from the Father, Whose work you do not consider to
be the chief work of the only true Godhead, but one to be compared to
the work of a creature.
