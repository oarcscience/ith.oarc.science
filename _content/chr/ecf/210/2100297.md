#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.x-p1"></span>St. John did not absolutely forbid that
prayer should be made for those who “sin unto death,” since he knew that
Moses, Jeremiah, and Stephen had so prayed, and he himself implies that
forgiveness is not to be denied them.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.x-p2"></span>44. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.x-p2.1"></span>Such</span> intercessors, then, must be
sought for after very grievous sins, for if any ordinary persons pray
they are not heard.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.x-p3"></span>45. So that point of yours will have no
<span id="page_337">p. 337</span> <span
id="iv.vi.ii.x-Page_337"></span>weight, which you take from the Epistle
of John, where he says: “He who knows that his brother sinneth a sin not
unto death, let him ask, and God will give him life, because he sinned
not unto death. There is a sin unto death: not concerning it do I say,
let him ask.” <span id="fr_2980"></span>[2981](#fn_2980) He was not
speaking to Moses and Jeremiah, but to the people, who must seek another
intercessor for their sins; the people, for whom it is sufficient they
entreat God for their lighter faults, and consider that pardon for
weightier sins must be reserved for the prayers of the just. For how
could John say that graver sins should not be prayed for, when he had
read that Moses prayed and obtained his request, where there had been
wilful casting off of faith, and knew that Jeremiah also had entreated?

<span id="iv.vi.ii.x-p5"></span>46. How could John say that we should
not pray for the sin unto death, who himself in the Apocalypse wrote the
message to the angel of the Church of Pergamos? “Thou hast there those
that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to put a
stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed
unto idols, and to commit fornication. So hast thou also them that hold
the doctrines of the Nicolaitans. Repent likewise, or else I will come
to thee quickly.” <span id="fr_2981"></span>[2982](#fn_2981) Do you see
that the same God Who requires repentance promises forgiveness? And then
He says: “He that hath ears let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
churches: To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden
manna.” <span id="fr_2982"></span>[2983](#fn_2982)

<span id="iv.vi.ii.x-p8"></span>47. Did not John himself know that
Stephen prayed for his persecutors, who had not been able even to listen
to the Name of Christ, when he said of those very men by whom he was
being stoned: “Lord, lay not this sin to their charge”? <span
id="fr_2983"></span>[2984](#fn_2983) And we see the result of this
prayer in the case of the Apostle, for Paul, who kept the garments of
those who were stoning Stephen, not long after became an apostle by the
grace of God, having before been a persecutor.

[Next: Chapter XI. The passage quoted from St. John's Epistle is
confirmed by another in which salvation is promised to those who believe
in Christ, which refutes the Novatians who try to induce the lapsed to
believe, although denying them pardon. Furthermore, many who had lapsed
have received the grace of martyrdom, whilst the example of the good
Samaritan shows that we must not abandon those in whom even the faintest
amount of faith is still alive.](2100298)
