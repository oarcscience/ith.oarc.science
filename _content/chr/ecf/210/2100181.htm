<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p1"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></A>The</span> notes to the first four books of the <i>De Fide</i> have in some instances been taken over from those in Father Hurter&#146;s Edition of the treatise (Innsbruck: Wagner), which has been used in preparing the translation of these books. These notes are distinguished by the letter "H." placed at the end.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p2"></A>The citations from Scripture embodied in the text have been translated as they stood in the original. This will account for any divergence from the renderings in the English Bible and Prayer-book, whilst any agreement may be set down to reminiscences of the more familiar versions. It was thought best to adopt this treatment of St. Ambrose&#146;s citations, inasmuch as the divergences are worth noticing, and indeed, in some cases, the argument rather turns upon them. The references are, throughout, made to chapters and verses in the English Bible, and not to the Vulgate, unless especially stated so to be.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p3"></A>The Prefaces and Summaries of Contents are based on those in Father Hurter&#146;s Edition.</p>
