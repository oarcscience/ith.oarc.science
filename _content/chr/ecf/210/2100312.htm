<p class="c32"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p1"></A>An exhortation to mourning and confession of sins for Christ is moved by these and the tears of the Church. Illustration from the story of Lazarus. After showing that the Novatians are the successors of those who planned to kill Lazarus, St. Ambrose argues that the full forgiveness of every sin is signified by the odour of the ointment poured by Mary on the feet of Christ; and further, that the Novatian heretics find their likeness in Judas, who grudged and envied when others rejoiced.</p>  
<p class="c22"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p2"></A>52. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p2.1"></A>Let</span> us, then, mourn for a time, that we may rejoice for eternity. Let us fear the Lord, let us anticipate Him with the confession of our sins, let us correct our backslidings and amend our faults, lest of us too it be said: &#8220;Woe is me, my soul, for the godly man is perished from the earth, and there is none amongst men to correct them.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3110"></A><A HREF="#fn_3110"><FONT SIZE="1">3111</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p4"></A>53. Why do you fear to confess your sins to our good Lord? &#8220;Set them forth,&#8221; He says, &#8220;that thou mayest be justified.&#8221; The rewards of justification are set before him who is still guilty of sin, for he is justified who voluntarily confesses his own sin; and lastly, &#8220;the just man is his own accuser in the beginning of his speaking.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3111"></A><A HREF="#fn_3111"><FONT SIZE="1">3112</FONT></A>
 The Lord knows all things, but He waits for your words, not that He may punish, but that He may pardon. It is not His will that the devil should triumph over you and accuse you when you conceal your sins. Be beforehand with your accuser: if you accuse yourself, you will fear no accuser; if you report yourself, though you were dead you shall live.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p6"></A>54. Christ will come to your grave, and if He finds there weeping for you Martha the woman of good service, and Mary who carefully heard the Word of God, like holy Church which has chosen the best part, He will be moved with compassion, when at your death He shall see the tears of many and will say: &#8220;Where have ye laid him?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3112"></A><A HREF="#fn_3112"><FONT SIZE="1">3113</FONT></A>
 that is to say, in what condition of guilt is he? in which rank of penitents? I would see him for whom ye weep, that he himself may move Me with his tears. I will see if he is already dead to that sin for which forgiveness is entreated.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p8"></A>55. The people will say to Him, &#8220;Come and see.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3113"></A><A HREF="#fn_3113"><FONT SIZE="1">3114</FONT></A>
 What is the meaning of &#8220;Come&#8221;? It means, Let forgiveness of sins come, let the life of the departed come, the resurrection of the dead, let Thy kingdom come to this sinner also.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p10"></A>56. He will come and will command that the stone be taken away which his fall has laid on the shoulders of the sinner. He could have removed the stone by a word of command, for even inanimate nature is wont to obey the bidding of Christ. He could by the silent power of His working have removed the stone of the sepulchre, at Whose Passion the stones being suddenly removed many sepulchres of the dead were opened, but He bade men remove the stone, in very truth indeed, that the unbelieving might believe what they saw, and see the dead rising again, but in a type that He might give us the power of lightening the burden of sins, the heavy pressure as it were upon the guilty. Ours it is to remove the burdens, His to raise again, His to bring forth from the tombs those set free from their bands.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p11"></A>57. So the Lord Jesus, seeing the heavy burden of the sinner, weeps, for the Church alone He suffers not to weep. He has compassion with His beloved, and says to him that is dead, &#8220;Come forth,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3114"></A><A HREF="#fn_3114"><FONT SIZE="1">3115</FONT></A>
 that is, Thou who liest in darkness of conscience, and in the squalor of thy sins, as in the prison-house of the guilty, come forth, declare thy sins that thou mayest be justified. &#8220;For with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3115"></A><A HREF="#fn_3115"><FONT SIZE="1">3116</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p14"></A>58. If you have confessed at the call of Christ the bars will be broken, and every chain loosed, even the stench of the bodily corruption be grievous. For he had been dead four days and his flesh stank in the tomb; but He Whose flesh saw no corruption was three days in the sepulchre, for He knew no evils of the flesh, which consists of the substances of the four elements. However great, then, the stench of the dead body may be, it is all done away so soon as the sacred ointment has shed its odour; and the dead rises again, and the command is given to loose his hands who till now was in sin; the covering is taken from his face which veiled the truth of the grace which he had received. But since he has received for<A NAME="page_353"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 353</FONT></A> <a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-Page_353"></A>giveness, the command is given to uncover his face, to lay bare his features. For he whose sin is forgiven has nothing whereof to be ashamed.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p15"></A>59. But in the presence of such grace given by the Lord, of such a miracle of divine bounty, when all ought to have rejoiced, the wicked were stirred up and gathered a council against Christ,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3116"></A><A HREF="#fn_3116"><FONT SIZE="1">3117</FONT></A>
 and wished moreover to kill Lazarus also.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3117"></A><A HREF="#fn_3117"><FONT SIZE="1">3118</FONT></A>
 Do you not recognize that you are the successors of those whose hardness you inherit? For you too are angry and gather a council against the Church, because you see the dead come to life again in the Church, and to be raised again by receiving forgiveness of their sins. And thus, so far as in you, you desire to slay again through envy those who are raised to life.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p18"></A>60. But Jesus does not revoke His benefits, nay, rather He amplifies them by additions of His liberality, He anxiously revisits him who was raised again, and rejoicing in the gift of the restored life, He comes to the feast which His Church has prepared for Him, at which he who had been dead is found as one amongst those sitting down with Christ.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p19"></A>61. Then all wonder who look upon him with the pure gaze of the mind, who are free from envy, for such children the Church has. They wonder, as I said, how he who yesterday and the day before lay in the tomb is one of those sitting with the Lord Jesus.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p20"></A>62. Mary herself pours ointment on the feet of the Lord Jesus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3118"></A><A HREF="#fn_3118"><FONT SIZE="1">3119</FONT></A>
 Perchance for this reason on His feet, because one of the lowliest has been snatched from death, for we are all the body of Christ,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3119"></A><A HREF="#fn_3119"><FONT SIZE="1">3120</FONT></A>
 but others perchance are the more honourable members. The Apostle was the mouth of Christ, for he said, &#8220;Ye seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3120"></A><A HREF="#fn_3120"><FONT SIZE="1">3121</FONT></A>
 The prophets through whom He spake of things to come were His mouth, would that I might be found worthy to be His foot, and may Mary pour on me her precious ointment, and anoint me and wipe away my sin.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p24"></A>63. What, then, we read concerning Lazarus we ought to believe of every sinner who is converted, who, though he may have been stinking, nevertheless is cleansed by the precious ointment of faith. For faith has such grace that there where the dead stank the day before, now the whole house is filled with good odour.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p25"></A>64. The house of Corinth stank, when it was written concerning it: &#8220;It is reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3121"></A><A HREF="#fn_3121"><FONT SIZE="1">3122</FONT></A>
 There was a stench, for a little leaven had corrupted the whole lump. A good odour began when it was said: &#8220;If ye forgive anything to any one I forgive also. For what I also have forgiven, for your sakes have I done it in the person of Christ.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3122"></A><A HREF="#fn_3122"><FONT SIZE="1">3123</FONT></A>
 And so, the sinner being set free, there was great joy in that place, and the whole house was filled with the odour of the sweetness of grace. Wherefore the Apostle, knowing well that he had shed upon all the ointment of apostolic forgiveness, says: &#8220;We are a sweet savour of Christ unto God in them that are saved.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3123"></A><A HREF="#fn_3123"><FONT SIZE="1">3124</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p29"></A>65. At the pouring forth, then, of this ointment all rejoice; Judas alone speaks against it.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3124"></A><A HREF="#fn_3124"><FONT SIZE="1">3125</FONT></A>
 So, too, now he who is a sinner speaks against it, he who is a traitor blames it, but he is himself blamed by Christ, as he knows not the remedy of the Lord&#146;s death, and understands not the mystery of that so great burial. For the Lord both suffered and died that He might redeem us from death. This is manifest from the most excellent value from His death, which is sufficient for the absolution of the sinner, and his restoration to fresh grace; so that all may come and wonder at his sitting at table with Christ, and may praise God, saying: &#8220;Let us eat and feast, for he was dead and is alive again, had perished and is found.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3125"></A><A HREF="#fn_3125"><FONT SIZE="1">3126</FONT></A>
 But any one devoid of faith objects: &#8220;Why does He eat with publicans and sinners?&#8221; This is his answer: &#8220;They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3126"></A><A HREF="#fn_3126"><FONT SIZE="1">3127</FONT></A>

<A HREF="2100313">Next: Chapter VIII. In urging repentance St. Ambrose turns to his own case, expressing the wish that he could wash our Lord's feet like the woman in the Gospel, which is a great pattern of penitence, though such as cannot attain to it find acceptance. He prays for himself, especially that he may sorrow with sinners, who are better than himself. Those for whom Christ died are not to be contemned.</A></CENTER>
