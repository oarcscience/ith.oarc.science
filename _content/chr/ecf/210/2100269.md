<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvi-p1"></span>He briefly takes up again the same
points of dispute, and shrewdly concludes from the unity of the divine
power in the Father and the Son, that whatever is said of the subjection
of the Son is to be referred to His humanity alone. He further confirms
this on proof of the love, which exists alike in either.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvi-p2"></span>182. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.xvi-p2.1"></span>Let</span> us then shortly sum up our
conclusion on the whole matter. A unity of power puts aside all idea of
a degrading subjection. His giving up of power, and His victory as
conqueror won over death, have not lessened His power. Obedience works
out subjection. Christ has taken obedience upon Himself, obedience even
to taking on Him our flesh, the cross even to gaining our salvation.
Thus where the work lies, there too is the Author of the work. When
therefore, all things have become subject to Christ, through Christ’s
obedience, so that all bend their knees in His name, then He Himself
will be all in all. For now, since all do not believe, all do not seem
to be in subjection. But when all have believed and done the will of
God, then Christ will be all and in all. And when Christ is all and in
all, then will God be all and in all; for the Father abides ever in the
Son. How, then, is He shown to be weak, Who redeemed the weak?

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvi-p3"></span>183. And lest thou shouldst by chance
attribute to the weakness of the Son, that it is written, that God hath
put all things in subjection under Him; learn that He has Himself
brought all things into subjection to Himself, for it is written: “Our
conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour, the
Lord Jesus, Who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like
unto His glorious body according to the working, whereby He is able to
subdue all things unto Himself.” <span
id="fr_2756"></span>[2757](#fn_2756) Thou has learnt, therefore, that He
can subdue all things unto Himself according to the working of His
Godhead.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvi-p5"></span>184. Learn now how He receives all
things in subjection according to the flesh, as it is written: “Who
wrought in Christ, raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own
right hand in the heavenly places, above principality and power and
might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world,
but also in that which is to come; and hath put all things under His
feet.” <span id="fr_2757"></span>[2758](#fn_2757) According to the flesh
then all things are given to Him in subjection; according to which also
He was raised from the dead, both in His human soul and His rational
subjection.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvi-p7"></span>185. Many nobly interpret that which
is written: “Truly my soul will be in subjection to God;” <span
id="fr_2758"></span>[2759](#fn_2758) He said soul not Godhead, soul not
glory. And that we might know that the Lord has spoken through the
prophet of the adoption of our human nature, He added: “How long will ye
cast yourselves upon a man?” <span id="fr_2759"></span>[2760](#fn_2759)
As also He says in the Gospel: “Why do ye seek to kill Me, a man?” <span
id="fr_2760"></span>[2761](#fn_2760) And He added again: “Nevertheless
they desired to refuse My price, they ran in thirst, they blessed with
their mouth, and cursed with their heart.” <span
id="fr_2761"></span>[2762](#fn_2761) For the Jews, when Judas brought
back the price, <span id="fr_2762"></span>[2763](#fn_2762) would not
receive it, running on in the thirst of madness, for they refused the
grace of a spiritual draught.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvi-p13"></span>186. This is the reverent
interpretation of subjection, for since this is the office of the <span
id="page_308">p. 308</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vii.xvi-Page_308"></span>Lord’s Passion, He will be subject in
us in that in which He suffered. Do we ask wherefore? That “neither
angels, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor things present, nor
things to come, nor any other creature may separate us from the love of
God, which is in Christ Jesus.” <span
id="fr_2763"></span>[2764](#fn_2763) We see then, from what has been
said, that no creature is excepted; but that every one, of whatever kind
it may be, is enumerated among those he mentioned above.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvi-p15"></span>187. At the same time, we must also
think of the words which, after first saying “Who shall separate us from
the love of Christ?” <span id="fr_2764"></span>[2765](#fn_2764) he wrote
next: “Neither death, nor life, nor any other creature can separate us
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus.” We see, then, that the
love of God is the same as the love of Christ. Thus it was not without
reason that he wrote of the love of God, “which is in Christ Jesus,”
lest otherwise thou mightest imagine that the love of God and of Christ
was divided. But there is nothing that love divides, nothing that the
eternal Godhead cannot do, nothing that is unknown to the Truth, or
deceives Justice, or escapes the notice of Wisdom.

[Next: Chapter XVI. The Arians are condemned by the Holy Spirit through
the mouth of David: for they dare to limit Christ's knowledge. The
passage cited by them in proof of this is by no means free from
suspicion of having been corrupted. But to set this right, we must mark
the word “Son.” For knowledge cannot fail Christ as Son of God, since He
is Wisdom; nor the recognition of any part, for He created all things.
It is not possible that He, who made the ages, cannot know the future,
much less the day of judgment. Such knowledge, whether it concerns
anything great or small, may not be denied to the Son, nor yet to the
Holy Spirit. Lastly, various proofs are given from which we can gather
that this knowledge exists in Christ.](2100270)
