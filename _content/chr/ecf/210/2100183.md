#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.i-p0.1"></span>Prologue.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.i-p1"></span>The author praises Gratian’s zeal for
instruction in the Faith, and speaks lowly of his own merits. Taught of
God Himself, the Emperor stands in no need of human instruction; yet
this his devoutness prepares the way to victory. The task appointed to
the author is difficult: in the accomplishment whereof he will be guided
not so much by reason and argument as by authority, especially that of
the Nicene Council.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.i-p2.1"></span>The</span> Queen of the South, as we read
in the Book of the Kings, came to hear the wisdom of Solomon. <span
id="fr_1660"></span>[1661](#fn_1660) Likewise King Hiram sent to Solomon
that he might prove him. <span id="fr_1661"></span>[1662](#fn_1661) So
also your sacred Majesty, following these examples of old time, has
decreed to hear my confession of faith. But I am no Solomon, that you
should wonder at my wisdom, and your Majesty is not the sovereign of a
single people; it is the Augustus, ruler of the whole world, that has
commanded the setting forth of the Faith in a book, not for your
instruction, but for your approval.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.i-p5"></span>2. For why, august Emperor, should your
Majesty learn that Faith which, from your earliest childhood, you have
ever devoutly and lovingly kept? “Before I formed thee in thy mother’s
belly I knew thee,” saith the Scripture, “and before thou camest forth
out of the womb I sanctified thee.” <span
id="fr_1662"></span>[1663](#fn_1662) Sanctification, therefore, cometh
not of tradition, but of inspiration; therefore keep watch over the
gifts of God. For that which no man hath taught you, God hath surely
given and inspired.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.i-p7"></span>3. Your sacred Majesty, being about to
go forth to war, requires of me a book, expounding the Faith, since your
Majesty knows that victories are gained more by faith in the commander,
than by valour in the soldiers. For Abraham led into battle three
hundred and eighteen men, <span id="fr_1663"></span>[1664](#fn_1663) and
brought home the spoils of countless foes; and having, by the power of
that which was the sign of our Lord’s Cross and Name, <span
id="fr_1664"></span>[1665](#fn_1664) overcome the might of five kings
and conquering hosts, he both avenged his neighbour and gained victory
and the ransom of his brother’s son. So also Joshua the son of Nun, when
he could not prevail against the enemy with the might of all his
army, <span id="fr_1665"></span>[1666](#fn_1665) overcame by sound of
seven sacred trumpets, in the place where he saw and knew the Captain of
the heavenly host. <span id="fr_1666"></span>[1667](#fn_1666) For
victory, then, your Majesty makes ready, being Christ’s loyal servant
and defender of the Faith, which you would have me set forth in writing.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.i-p12"></span>4. Truly, I would rather take upon me
the duty of exhortation to keep the Faith, than that of disputing
thereon; for the former means devout confession, whereas the latter is
liable to rash presumption. Howbeit, forasmuch as your Majesty has no
need of exhortation, whilst I may not pray to be excused from the duty
of loyalty, I will take in hand a bold enterprise, yet modestly withal,
not so much reasoning and disputing concerning the Faith as gathering
together a multitude of witness. <span
id="fr_1667"></span>[1668](#fn_1667)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.i-p14"></span>5. Of the Acts of Councils, I shall
let that one be my chief guide which three hundred and eighteen priests,
appointed, as it were, after the judgment of Abraham, <span
id="fr_1668"></span>[1669](#fn_1668) made (so <span id="page_202">p.
202</span> <span id="iv.iv.iii.i-Page_202"></span>to speak) a trophy
raised to proclaim their victory over the infidel throughout the world,
prevailing by that courage of the Faith, wherein all agreed. Verily, as
it seems to me, one may herein see the hand of God, forasmuch as the
same number is our authority in the Councils of the Faith, and an
example of loyalty in the records of old.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.i-p6"></span> “By sanctification is meant the grace
of regeneration, which comprises virtues inspired, including both the
habit of faith and the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Now these support
especially the innocent soul, so that with pious affection it nurses the
doctrine revealed to it, is inclined thereto, loves it, takes it to
itself, and advances in it.”—Hurter *ad loc.* The Emperor’s constant
zeal in defence of the Faith against the Arians is to be regarded as due
to his habit of faith and to the gifts of the Spirit. The citation is

<span id="iv.iv.iii.i-p9"></span> The original form of the Cross was
that of the letter T. The numerical value of the sign T (Tau), in Greek
arithmetic was 300. Eighteen was represented by <span

two letters of the name <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.i-p9.2"></span>᾽Ιησοὐς</span>, Jesus. To St. Ambrose,
therefore, it seemed that there was some mysterious power in the number
318, represented by the sign of the Cross and the first two letters of
the Saviour’s name, thus—TIH.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.i-p15"></span> See the note 2 on § 3. St. Ambrose is
here speaking of the Œcumenical Council held at Nicæa in Bithynia, <span
class="sc"><span id="iv.iv.iii.i-p15.1"></span>a.d.</span> 325.
Different accounts are given of the numbers present. *Eusebius* says
there were 250 bishops in the Council; *Athanasius* and *Socrates,*
“more than 300;” *Sozomen* “about 320.” The number 318, however, is also
given by Athanasius as well as by Theodoret and Epiphanius. See
Robertson’s *History of the Church,* Bk. II. ch. i. The victory over the
infidel is, of course, the victory of the orthodox Catholics over Arius,
and the Nicene Symbol may be regarded as the “trophy” commemorating the
victory, the reality of which lay in getting the clause “of one
substance with the Father” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.i-p15.2"></span>ὁμοούσιον τῷ Πατρί</span>) subscribed to.
The original Nicene Creed, it may be useful to observe, was not exactly
the same in form as the symbol which now is generally known by that
name, and which is part of the Eucharistic office of the English Church.
This latter is an enlargement of the original, and it appears to have
been in use for a considerable time (not less than seventy years) before
it was produced at the Council of Chalcedon in 451. It obtained general
acceptance by the middle of the sixth century. Towards the end of that
century (589 <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.i-p15.3"></span>a.d.</span>) an additional clause,
proclaiming the procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son as well as the
Father, was inserted at the Council of Toledo. This insertion was
repudiated by the Church in the East, and became one of the causes of
the separation of Eastern from Western Christendom.

[Next: Chapter I. The author distinguishes the faith from the errors of
Pagans, Jews, and Heretics, and after explaining the significance of the
names “God” and “Lord,” shows clearly the difference of Persons in Unity
of Essence. In dividing the Essence, the Arians not only bring in the
doctrine of three Gods, but even overthrow the dominion of the
Trinity.](2100184)
