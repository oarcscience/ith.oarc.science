<p> <a name="iv.i.iii.i"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.i.iii.i-p0.1"></A>Chapter I.</h4>  
<p class="c32"><a name="iv.i.iii.i-p1"></A>Happiness in life is to be gained by living virtuously, inasmuch as thus a Christian, whilst despising glory and the favour of men, desires to please God alone in what he does.</p>  
<p class="c22"><a name="iv.i.iii.i-p2"></A>1. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.i.iii.i-p2.1"></A>In</span> the first book we spoke of the duties&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_368"></A><A HREF="#fn_368"><FONT SIZE="1">369</FONT></A>
 which we thought befitted a virtuous life, whereon no one has ever doubted but that a blessed life, which the Scripture calls eternal life, depends. So great is the splendour of a virtuous life that a peaceful conscience and a calm innocence work out a happy life. And as the risen sun hides the globe of the moon and the light of the stars, so the brightness of a virtuous life, where it glitters in true pure glory, casts into the shade all other things, which, according to the desires of the body, are considered to be good, or are reckoned in the eyes of the world to be great and noble.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.i.iii.i-p4"></A>2. Blessed, plainly, is that life which is not valued at the estimation of outsiders, but is known, as judge of itself, by its own inner feelings. It needs no popular opinion as its reward in any way; nor has it any fear of punishments. Thus the less it strives for glory, the more it rises above it. For to those who seek for glory, that reward in the shape of present things is but a shadow of future ones, and is a hindrance to eternal life, as it is written in the Scriptures: &#8220;Verily, I say unto you, they have received their reward.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_369"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">370</FONT></A>
 This is said of those who, as it were, with the sound of a trumpet desire to make known to all the world the liberality they exercise towards the poor. It is the same, too, in the case of fasting,  <A NAME="page_44"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 44</FONT></A> <a name="iv.i.iii.i-Page_44"></A>which is done but for outward show. &#8220;They have,&#8221; he says, &#8220;their reward.&#8221;</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.i.iii.i-p6"></A>3. It therefore belongs to a virtuous life to show mercy and to fast in secret; that thou mayest seem to be seeking a reward from thy God alone, and not from men. For he who seeks it from man has his reward, but he who seeks it from God has eternal life, which none can give but the Lord of Eternity, as it is said: &#8220;Verily, I say unto thee, to-day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_370"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">371</FONT></A>
 Wherefore the Scripture plainly has called that life which is blessed, eternal life. It has not been left to be appraised according to man&#146;s ideas on the subject, but has been entrusted to the divine judgment.</p>

<A HREF="2100065">Next: Chapter II. The different ideas of philosophers on the subject of happiness. He proves, first, from the Gospel that it rests on the knowledge of God and the pursuit of good works; next, that it may not be thought that this idea was adopted from the philosophers, he adds proofs from the witness of the prophets.</A></CENTER>
