<p> <a name="iv.viii.xv"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="iv.viii.xv-p0.1"></A>Chapter XIV.</h3>  
<p class="c32"><a name="iv.viii.xv-p1"></A>Though a widow may have received no commandment, yet she has received so many counsels that she ought not to think little of them. St. Ambrose would be sorry to lay any snare for her, seeing that the field of the Church grows richer as a result of wedlock, but it is absolutely impossible to deny that widowhood, which St. Paul praises, is profitable. Consequently, he speaks severely about those who have proscribed widowhood by law.</p>  
<p class="c22"><a name="iv.viii.xv-p2"></A>82. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.viii.xv-p2.1"></A>But</span> neither has the widow received any command, but a counsel; a counsel, however, not given once only but often repeated. For, first, it is said: &#8220;It is good for a man not to touch a woman.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3398"></A><A HREF="#fn_3398"><FONT SIZE="1">3399</FONT></A>
 And again: &#8220;I would that all men were even as I myself;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3399"></A><A HREF="#fn_3399"><FONT SIZE="1">3400</FONT></A>
 and once more: &#8220;It is good for them if they remain even as I;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3400"></A><A HREF="#fn_3400"><FONT SIZE="1">3401</FONT></A>
 and a fourth time: &#8220;It is good for the present distress.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3401"></A><A HREF="#fn_3401"><FONT SIZE="1">3402</FONT></A>
 And that it is well pleasing to the Lord, and honourable, and, lastly, that perseverance in widowhood is happier, he lays down not only as his own judgment, but also as an aspiration of the Holy Spirit. Who, then, can reject the kindness of such a counsellor? Who gives the reins to the will, and advises in the case of others that which he has found advantageous by his own experience, he who is not easy to catch up, and is not hurt at being equalled. Who, then, would shrink from becoming holy in body and spirit, since the reward is far above the toil, grace beyond need, and the wages above the work?</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.viii.xv-p7"></A>83. And this, I say, not in order to lay a snare for others, but that as a good husbandman of the land entrusted to me, I may see this field of the Church to be fruitful, at one time blossoming with the flowers of purity, at another time strong in the gravity of widowhood, and yet again abounding with the fruits of wedlock. For though they be diverse, yet they are the fruits of one field; there are not so many lilies in the gardens as ears of corn in the fields, and many more fields are prepared for receiving seed than lie fallow after the crops are gathered in.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.viii.xv-p8"></A>84. Widowhood is, then, good, which is so often praised by the judgment of the apostles, for it is a teacher of the faith  <A NAME="page_406"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 406</FONT></A> <a name="iv.viii.xv-Page_406"></A>and a teacher of chastity. Whereas they who honour the adulteries and the shame of their gods appointed penalties for celibacy and widowhood;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3402"></A><A HREF="#fn_3402"><FONT SIZE="1">3403</FONT></A>
 that zealous in pursuit of crimes they might punish the study of virtues; under the pretext, indeed, of seeking increase of the population, but in reality that they might put an end to the purpose of chastity. For the soldier, when his time is ended, lays aside his arms, and leaving the rank which he held, is dismissed as a veteran to his own land, that he may obtain rest after the toils of a laborious life, and cause others to be more ready to undergo labour in the hope of future repose. The labourer, too, as he grows too old, entrusts the guiding of the plough to others, and worn out by the toil of his youth, enjoys in his old age that which his foresight has cared for, still ready to prune the vine rather than to press the grapes, so as to check the luxuriance of early life, and to cut off with his pruning knife the wantonness of youth, teaching, as it were, that blessed fruitfulness is to be aimed at even in the vine.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.viii.xv-p10"></A>85. In like manner the widow, as a veteran, having served her time, though she lays aside the arms of married life, yet orders the peace of the whole house: though now freed from carrying burdens, she is yet watchful for the younger who are to be married; and with the thoughtfulness of old age she arranges where more pains would be profitable, where produce would be more abundant, which is fitted for the marriage bond. And so, if the field is entrusted to the elder rather than to the younger, why should you think that it is more advantageous to be a married woman than a widow? But, if the persecutors of the faith have also been the persecutors of widowhood, most certainly by those who hold the faith, widowhood is not to be shunned as a penalty, but to be esteemed as a reward.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.viii.xv-p9"></A> The reference would seem to be to the &#8220;<i>Lex Julia et Papia Popp&aelig;a,</i>&#8221; but the object of this law was not, as St. Ambrose seems to imply, to check celibacy, but to meet the growing licentiousness of the age, which avoided the obligations of married life while indulging in every kind of impure abominations.</p>

<A HREF="2100364">Next: Chapter XV. St. Ambrose meets the objection of those who make the desire of having children an excuse for second marriage, and especially in the case of those who have children of their former marriage; and points out the consequent troubles of disagreements amongst the children, and even between the married persons, and gives a warning against a wrong use of Scripture instances in this matter.</A></CENTER>
