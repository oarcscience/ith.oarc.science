#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p1"></span>The Arians openly take sides with the
heathen in attacking the words: “He that believeth on Me, believeth not
on Me,” etc. The true meaning of the passage is unfolded; and to prevent
us from believing that the Lord forbade us to have faith in Him, it is
shown how He spoke at one time as God, at another as Man. After bringing
forward examples of various results of that faith, he shows that certain
other passages also must be taken in the same way.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p2"></span>118. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p2.1"></span>Last</span> of all, to show that they are
not Christians, they deny that we are to believe on Christ, saying that
it is written: “He that believeth on Me, believeth not on Me, but on Him
that sent Me.” <span id="fr_2672"></span>[2673](#fn_2672) I was awaiting
this confession; why did you delude me with your quibbles? I knew I had
to contend with heathens. Nay, they indeed are converted, but ye are
not. If they believe, that the sacrament \[of Baptism\] is safe; ye have
received it, and destroyed it, or perchance it has never been received,
but was unreal <span id="fr_2673"></span>[2674](#fn_2673) from the
first.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p5"></span>119. It is written, they say: “He that
believeth on Me, believeth not on Me, but on Him that sent Me.” But see
what follows, and see how the Son of God wishes to be seen; for it
continues: “And he that seeth Me, seeth Him that sent Me,” <span
id="fr_2674"></span>[2675](#fn_2674) for the Father is seen in the Son.
Thus, He has explained what He had spoken earlier, that he who confesses
the Father believes on the Son. For he who knows not the Son, neither
knows the Father. For every one that denies the Son has not the Father,
but he that confesses the Son has both the Father and the Son. <span
id="fr_2675"></span>[2676](#fn_2675)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p8"></span>120. What, then, is the meaning of
“Believeth not on Me”? That is, not on that which you can perceive in
bodily form, nor merely on the man whom you see. For He has stated that
we are to believe not merely on a man, but that thou mayest believe that
Jesus Christ Himself is both God and Man. Wherefore, for both reasons He
says: “I came not from Myself;” <span
id="fr_2676"></span>[2677](#fn_2676) and again: “I am the beginning, of
which also I speak to you.” <span id="fr_2677"></span>[2678](#fn_2677)
As Man He came not from Himself; as Son of God He takes not <span
id="page_300">p. 300</span> <span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-Page_300"></span>His
beginning from men; but “I am,” He says, “Myself ‘the beginning of which
also I speak to you.’ Neither are the words which I speak human, but
divine.”

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p11"></span>121. Nor is it right to believe that
He denied we were to believe on Him, since He Himself said: “That
whosoever believeth on Me should not abide in darkness;” <span
id="fr_2678"></span>[2679](#fn_2678) and in another place again: “For
this is the will of My Father that sent Me, that every one that seeth
the Son, and believeth on Him, may have eternal life;” <span
id="fr_2679"></span>[2680](#fn_2679) and again: “Ye believe in God,
believe also in Me.” <span id="fr_2680"></span>[2681](#fn_2680)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p15"></span>122. Let no one, therefore, receive
the Son without the Father, because we read of the Son. The Son hath the
Father, but not in a temporal sense, nor by reason of His passion, nor
owing to His conception, nor by grace. I have read of His Generation, I
have not read of His Conception. And the Father says: “I have
begotten;” <span id="fr_2681"></span>[2682](#fn_2681) He does not say:
“I have created.” And the Son calls not God His Creator in the eternity
of His divine Generation, but Father.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p17"></span>123. He represents Himself also now
in the character of man, now in the majesty of God; now claiming for
Himself oneness of Godhead with the Father, now taking upon Him all the
frailty of human flesh; now saying that He has not His own doctrine, and
now that He seeks not His own will; now pointing out that His testimony
is not true, and now that it is true. For He Himself has said: “If I
bear witness of Myself, My witness is not true.” <span
id="fr_2682"></span>[2683](#fn_2682) Later on He says: “If I bear
witness of Myself, My witness is true.” <span
id="fr_2683"></span>[2684](#fn_2683)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p20"></span>124. And how is Thy testimony, Lord
Jesus, not true? Did not he who believed it, though he hung upon the
cross, and paid the penalty for the crime he owned to, cast aside the
deserts of the robber and gain the reward of the innocent? <span
id="fr_2684"></span>[2685](#fn_2684)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p22"></span>125. Was Paul deceived, who received
his sight, because he believed; <span
id="fr_2685"></span>[2686](#fn_2685) which sight he had lost, before he
believed?

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p24"></span>126. And did Joshua, the son of Nun,
err in recognizing the leader of the heavenly host? <span
id="fr_2686"></span>[2687](#fn_2686) But after he believed, he forthwith
conquered, being found worthy to triumph in the battle of faith. Again,
he did not lead forth his armed ranks into the fight, nor did he
overthrow the ramparts of the enemy’s walls, with battering rams or
other engines of war, but with the sound of the seven trumpets of the
priests. Thus the blare of the trumpet and the badge of the priest
brought a cruel war to an end.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p26"></span>127. A harlot saw this; and she who
in the destruction of the city lost all hope of any means of safety,
because her faith had conquered, bound a scarlet thread in her window,
and thus uplifted a sign of her faith and the banner of the Lord’s
Passion; <span id="fr_2687"></span>[2688](#fn_2687) so that the
semblance of the mystic blood, which should redeem the world, might be
in memory. So, without, the name of Joshua was a sign of victory to
those who fought; within, the semblance of the Lord’s Passion was a sign
of salvation to those in danger. Wherefore, because Rahab understood the
heavenly mystery, the Lord says in the Psalm: “I will be mindful of
Rahab and Babylon that know Me.” <span
id="fr_2688"></span>[2689](#fn_2688)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p29"></span>128. How, then, is Thy testimony not
true, O Lord, except it be given in accordance with the frailty of man?
For “every man is a liar.” <span id="fr_2689"></span>[2690](#fn_2689)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p31"></span>129. Lastly, to prove that He spoke
as man, He says: “The Father that sent Me, He beareth witness of
Me.” <span id="fr_2690"></span>[2691](#fn_2690) But His testimony as God
is true, as He Himself says: “My record is true: for I know whence I
come, and whither I go, but ye know not whence I come, and whither I go.
Ye judge after the flesh.” <span id="fr_2691"></span>[2692](#fn_2691)
They judge then not after the Godhead but after the manhood, who think
that Christ had not the power of bearing witness.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p34"></span>130. Therefore, when thou hearest:
“He that believeth, believeth not on Me;” or: “The Father that sent Me,
He gave Me a commandment;” <span id="fr_2692"></span>[2693](#fn_2692)
thou hast now learnt whither thou oughtest to refer those words. Lastly,
He shows what the commandment is, saying: “I lay down My life, that I
may take it again. No man taketh it from Me, but I lay it down of
Myself.” <span id="fr_2693"></span>[2694](#fn_2693) Thou seest, then,
what is said so as to show He had full power to lay down or to take up
His life; as He also said: “I have power to lay it down, and I have
power again to take it up. This commandment have I received of My
Father.” <span id="fr_2694"></span>[2695](#fn_2694)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xi-p38"></span>131. Whether, then, a command, or, as
some Latin manuscripts have it, a direction was given, it was certainly
not given to Him as God, but as incarnate man, with reference to the
victory He should gain in undergoing His Passion.

[Next: Chapter XI. We must refer the fact that Christ is said to speak
nothing of Himself, to His human nature. After explaining how it is
right to say that He hears and sees the Father as being God, He shows
conclusively, by a large number of proofs, that the Son of God is not a
creature.](2100265)
