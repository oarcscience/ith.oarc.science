<span id="iv.i.ii.xlv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xlv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLV.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlv-p1"></span>On what is noble and virtuous, and what
the difference between them is, as stated both in the profane and sacred
writers.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlv-p2"></span>228. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xlv-p2.1"></span>Let</span> us then hold fast modesty, and
that moderation which adds to the beauty of the whole of life. For it is
no light thing in every matter to preserve due measure <span
id="page_37">p. 37</span> <span id="iv.i.ii.xlv-Page_37"></span>and to
bring about order, wherein that is plainly conspicuous which we call
“decorum,” or what is seemly. This is so closely connected with what is
virtuous, that one cannot separate the two. <span
id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318) For what is seemly is also
virtuous—and what is virtuous is seemly. So that the distinction lies
rather in the words than in the things themselves. That there is a
difference between them we can understand, but we cannot explain it.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlv-p4"></span>229. To make an attempt to get some
sort of a distinction between them, we may say that what is virtuous may
be compared to the good health and soundness of the body, whilst what is
seemly is, as it were, its comeliness and beauty. And as beauty seems to
stand above soundness and health, and yet cannot exist without them, nor
be separated from them in any way—for unless one has good health, one
cannot have beauty and comeliness—so what is virtuous contains in itself
also what is seemly, so as to seem to start with it, and to be unable to
exist without it. What is virtuous, then, is like soundness in all our
work and undertaking; what is seemly is, as it were, the outward
appearance, which, when joined with what is virtuous, can only be known
apart in our thoughts. For though in some cases it seems to stand out
conspicuous, yet it has its root in what is virtuous, though the flower
is its own. Rooted in this, it flourishes; otherwise it fails and
droops. For what is virtue, but to avoid anything shameful as though it
were death? And what is the opposite of virtue, except that which brings
barrenness and death? If, then, the essence of virtue is strong and
vigorous, seemliness will also quickly spring forth like a flower, for
its root is sound. But if the root of its purpose is corrupt, nothing
will grow out of it.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlv-p5"></span>230. In our writings this is put
somewhat more plainly. For David says: “The Lord reigneth, He is clothed
with splendour.” <span id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319) And the Apostle
says: “Walk honestly as in the day.” <span
id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320) The Greek text has <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.i.ii.xlv-p7.2"></span>ευσχημόνως</span> —and
this really means: with good clothing, with a good appearance. When God
made the first man, He created him with a good figure, with limbs well
set, and gave him a very noble appearance. He had not given him
remission of sins. But afterwards He, Who came in the form of a servant,
and in the likeness of man, renewed him with His Spirit, and poured His
grace into his heart, and put on Himself the splendour <span
id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321) of the redemption of the human race.
Therefore the Prophet said: “The Lord reigneth, He is clothed with
splendour.” <span id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322) And again he says:
“A hymn beseems Thee, O God, in Sion.” <span
id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323) That is: It is right and good to fear
Thee, to love Thee, to pray to Thee, to honour Thee, for it is written:
“Let all things be done decently and in order.” <span
id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324) But we can also fear, love, ask,
honour men; yet the hymn especially is addressed to God. This seemliness
which we offer to God we may believe to be far better than other things.
It befits also a woman to pray in an orderly dress, <span
id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325) but it especially beseems her to pray
covered, and to pray giving promise of purity together with a good
conversation.

[Next: Chapter XLVI. A twofold division of what is seemly is given. Next
it is shown that what is according to nature is virtuous, and what is
otherwise must be looked on as shameful. This division is explained by
examples.](2100058)
