#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.ii-p1"></span>The Son and the Spirit are alike given;
whence not subjection but one Godhead is shown by Its working.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.ii-p2"></span>9. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.ii-p2.1"></span>And</span> not only did the Father send the
Son, but also gave Him, as the Son Himself gave Himself. For we read:
“Grace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, Who gave
Himself for our sins.” <span id="fr_1241"></span>[1242](#fn_1241) If
they think that He was subject in that He was sent, they cannot deny
that it was of grace that He was given. But He was given by the Father,
as Isaiah said: “Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given;” <span
id="fr_1242"></span>[1243](#fn_1242) but He was given, I dare to say it,
by the Spirit also, Who was sent by the Spirit. For since the prophet
has not defined by whom <span id="page_137">p. 137</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iv.ii-Page_137"></span>He was given, he shows that He was
given by the grace of the Trinity; and inasmuch as the Son Himself gave
Himself, He could not be subject to Himself according to His Godhead.
Therefore that He was given could not be a sign of subjection in the
God-head.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.ii-p5"></span>10. But the Holy Spirit also was given,
for it is written: “I will ask the Father, and He shall give you another
Paraclete.” <span id="fr_1243"></span>[1244](#fn_1243) And the Apostle
says: “Wherefore he that despiseth these things despiseth not man but
God, Who hath given us His Holy Spirit.” <span
id="fr_1244"></span>[1245](#fn_1244) Isaiah, too, shows that both the
Spirit and the Son are given: “Thus,” says he, “saith the Lord God, Who
made the heaven and fashioned it, Who stablished the earth, and the
things which are in it, and giveth breath to the people upon it, and the
Spirit to them that walk upon it.” <span
id="fr_1245"></span>[1246](#fn_1245) And to the Son: “I am the Lord God,
Who have called Thee in righteousness, and will hold Thine hand, and
will strengthen Thee; and I have given Thee for a covenant of My people,
for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out
of their fetters those that are bound.” <span
id="fr_1246"></span>[1247](#fn_1246) Since, then, the Son is both sent
and given, and the Spirit also is both sent and given, They have
assuredly a oneness of Godhead Who have a oneness of action.

[Next: Chapter III. The same Unity may also be recognized from the fact
that the Spirit is called Finger, and the Son Right Hand; for the
understanding of divine things is assisted by the usage of human
language. The tables of the law were written by this Finger, and they
were afterwards broken, and the reason. Lastly, Christ wrote with the
same Finger; yet we must not admit any inferiority in the Spirit from
this bodily comparison.](2100155)
