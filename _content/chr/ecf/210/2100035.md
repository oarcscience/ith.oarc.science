#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxiii-p1"></span>Jests, although at times they may be
quite proper, should be altogether banished among clerics. The voice
should be plain and frank.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxiii-p2"></span>102. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Men</span> of the world give many further
rules about the way to speak, <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151)
which I think we may pass over; as, for instance, the way jesting should
be conducted. <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152) For though at
times jests may be proper and pleasant, yet they are unsuited to the
clerical life. For how can we adopt those things which we do not find in
the holy Scriptures?

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxiii-p5"></span>103. We must also take care that in
relating stories we do not alter the earnest purpose of the harder rule
we have set before us. “Woe unto you that laugh, for ye shall
weep,” <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153) says the Lord. Do we seek
for something to laugh at, that laughing here we may weep hereafter? I
think we ought to avoid not only broad jokes, but all kinds of jests,
unless perchance it is not unfitting at the time for our conversation to
be agreeable and pleasant.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxiii-p7"></span>104. In speaking of the voice, I
certainly think it ought to be plain and clear. <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154) That it should be musical is a gift of
nature, and is not to be won by exertion. Let it be distinct in its
pronunciation and full of a manly vigour, but let it be free from a
rough and rustic twang. See, too, that it does not assume a theatrical
accent, but rather keeps true to the inner meaning of the words it
utters.

[Next: Chapter XXIV. There are three things to be noticed in the actions
of our life. First, our passions are to be controlled by our reason;
next, we ought to observe a suitable moderation in our desires; and,
lastly, everything ought to be done at the right time and in the proper
order. All these qualities shone forth so conspicuously in the holy men
of Old Testament time, that it is evident they were well furnished with
what men call the cardinal virtues.](2100036)
