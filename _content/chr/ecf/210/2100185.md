<span id="iv.iv.iii.iii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iii-p1"></span>The Emperor is exhorted to display
zeal in the Faith. Christ’s perfect Godhead is shown from the unity of
will and working which He has with the Father. The attributes of
Divinity are shown to be proper to Christ, Whose various titles prove
His essential unity, with distinction of Person. In no other way can the
unity of God be maintained.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iii-p2"></span>12. “<span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>Not</span> every one that saith unto Me
Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven,” <span
id="fr_1688"></span>[1689](#fn_1688) saith the Scripture. Faith,
therefore, august Sovereign, must not be a mere matter of performance,
for it is written, “The zeal of thine house hath devoured me.” <span
id="fr_1689"></span>[1690](#fn_1689) Let us then with faithful spirit
and devout mind call upon Jesus our Lord, let us believe that He is God,
to the end that whatever we ask of the Father, we may obtain in His
name. <span id="fr_1690"></span>[1691](#fn_1690) For the Father’s will
is, that He be entreated through the Son, the Son’s that the Father be
entreated. <span id="fr_1691"></span>[1692](#fn_1691)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iii-p7"></span>13. The grace of His submission makes
for agreement \[with our teaching\], and the acts of His power are not
at variance therewith. For whatsoever things the Father doeth, the same
also doeth the Son, in like manner. <span
id="fr_1692"></span>[1693](#fn_1692) The Son both doeth the same things,
and doeth them in like manner, but it is the Father’s will that He be
entreated in the matter of what He Himself proposeth to do, that you may
understand, not that He cannot do it otherwise, but that there is one
power displayed. Truly, then, is the Son of God to be adored and
worshipped, Who by the power of His Godhead hath laid the foundations of
the world, and by His submission informed our affections. <span
id="fr_1693"></span>[1694](#fn_1693)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iii-p10"></span>14. Therefore we ought to believe
that God is good, eternal, perfect, almighty, and true, such as we find
Him in the Law and the Prophets, and the rest of the holy
Scriptures, <span id="fr_1694"></span>[1695](#fn_1694) for otherwise
there is no God. For He Who is God cannot but be good, seeing that
fulness of goodness is of the nature of God: <span
id="fr_1695"></span>[1696](#fn_1695) nor can God, Who made time, be in
time; nor, again, can God be imperfect, for a lesser being is plainly
imperfect, seeing that it lacks somewhat whereby it could be made equal
to a greater. This, then, is the teaching of our faith—that God is not
evil, that with God nothing is impossible, that God exists not in time,
that God is beneath no being. If I am in error, let my adversaries prove
it. <span id="fr_1696"></span>[1697](#fn_1696)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iii-p14"></span>15. Seeing, then, that Christ is
God, He is, by consequence, good and almighty and eternal and perfect
and true; for these attributes belong to the essential nature of the
Godhead. Let our adversaries, therefore, deny the Divine Nature in
Christ,—otherwise they cannot refuse to God what is proper to the Divine
Nature.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iii-p15"></span>16. Further, that none may fall into
error, let a man attend to those signs vouchsafed us by holy Scripture,
whereby we may know the Son. He is called the Word, the Son, the Power
of God, the Wisdom of God. <span id="fr_1697"></span>[1698](#fn_1697)
<span id="page_204">p. 204</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iii.iii-Page_204"></span>The Word, because He is without
blemish; the Power, because He is perfect; the Son, because He is
begotten of the Father; the Wisdom, because He is one with the Father,
one in eternity, one in Divinity. Not that the Father is one Person with
the Son; between Father and Son is the plain distinction that comes of
generation; <span id="fr_1698"></span>[1699](#fn_1698) so that Christ is
God of God, Everlasting of Everlasting, Fulness of Fulness. <span
id="fr_1699"></span>[1700](#fn_1699)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iii-p19"></span>17. Now these are not mere names,
but signs of power manifesting itself in works, for while there is
fulness of Godhead in the Father, there is also fulness of Godhead in
the Son, not diverse, but one. The Godhead is nothing confused, for it
is an unity: nothing manifold, for in it there is no difference.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iii-p20"></span>18. Moreover, if in all them that
believed there was, as it is written, one soul and one heart: <span
id="fr_1700"></span>[1701](#fn_1700) if every one that cleaveth to the
Lord is one spirit, <span id="fr_1701"></span>[1702](#fn_1701) as the
Apostle hath said: if a man and his wife are one flesh: <span
id="fr_1702"></span>[1703](#fn_1702) if all we mortal men are, so far as
regards our general nature, of one substance: if this is what the
Scripture saith of created men, that, being many, they are one, <span
id="fr_1703"></span>[1704](#fn_1703) who can in no way be compared to
Divine Persons, how much more are the Father and the Son one in
Divinity, with Whom there is no difference either of substance or of
will!

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iii-p25"></span>19. For how else shall we say that
God is One? Divinity maketh plurality, but unity of power debarreth
quantity of number, seeing that unity is not number, but itself is the
principle of all numbers.

[Next: Chapter III. By evidence gathered from Scripture the unity of
Father and Son is proved, and firstly, a passage, taken from the Book of
Isaiah, is compared with others and expounded in such sort as to show
that in the Son there is no diversity from the Father's nature, save
only as regards the flesh; whence it follows that the Godhead of both
Persons is One. This conclusion is confirmed by the authority of
Baruch.](2100186)
