<span id="iv.vi.ii.xi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xi-p1"></span>The passage quoted from St. John’s
Epistle is confirmed by another in which salvation is promised to those
who believe in Christ, which refutes the Novatians who try to induce the
lapsed to believe, although denying them pardon. Furthermore, many who
had lapsed have received the grace of martyrdom, whilst the example of
the good Samaritan shows that we must not abandon those in whom even the
faintest amount of faith is still alive.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xi-p2"></span>48. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xi-p2.1"></span>Since</span>, then, we have spoken of the
general Epistle of St. John, let us enquire whether the writings of John
in the Gospel agree with your interpretation. For he writes that the
Lord said: “God so loved this world, that He gave His only-begotten Son,
that every one that believeth on Him should not perish but have
everlasting life.” <span id="fr_2984"></span>[2985](#fn_2984) If, then,
you wish to reclaim any one of the lapsed, do you exhort him to believe,
or not to believe? Undoubtedly you exhort him to believe. But, according
to the Lord’s words, he who believes shall have everlasting life. How,
then, will you forbid to pray for him, who has a claim to everlasting
life? since faith is of divine grace, as the Apostle teaches where he
speaks of the differences of gifts, for “to another is given faith by
the same Spirit.” <span id="fr_2985"></span>[2986](#fn_2985) And the
disciples say to the Lord: “Increase our faith.” <span
id="fr_2986"></span>[2987](#fn_2986) He then who has faith has life, and
he who has life is certainly not shut out from pardon; “that every one,”
it is said, “that believeth on Him should not perish.” Since it is said,
Every one, no one is shut out, no one is excepted, for He does not
except him who has lapsed, if only afterwards he believes effectually.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xi-p6"></span>49. We find that many have at length
recovered themselves after a fall, and have suffered for the Name of
God. Can we deny fellowship with the martyrs to these to whom the Lord
Jesus has not denied it? Do we dare to say that life is not restored to
those to whom Christ has given a crown? As, then, a crown is given to
many after they have lapsed, so, too, if they believe, their faith is
restored, which faith is the gift of God, as you read: “Because unto you
it hath been granted by God not only to believe in Him, but also to
suffer in His behalf.” <span id="fr_2987"></span>[2988](#fn_2987) Is it
possible that he who has the gift of God should not have His
forgiveness?

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xi-p8"></span>50. Now it is not a single but a
twofold grace that every one who believes should also suffer for the
Lord Jesus. He, then, who believes receives his grace, but he receives a
second, if his faith be crowned by suffering. For neither was Peter
without grace before he suffered, but when he suffered he received a
second gift. And many who have not had the grace to suffer for Christ
have nevertheless had the grace of believing on Him.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xi-p9"></span>51. Therefore it is said: “That every
<span id="page_338">p. 338</span> <span
id="iv.vi.ii.xi-Page_338"></span>one that believeth in Him should not
perish.” Let no one, that is, of whatever condition, after whatever
fall, fear that he will perish. For it may come to pass that the good
Samaritan of the Gospel may find some one going down from Jerusalem to
Jericho, that is, falling back from the martyr’s conflict to the
pleasures of this life and the comforts of the world; wounded by
robbers, that is, by persecutors, and left half dead; that good
Samaritan, Who is the Guardian of our souls (for the word Samaritan
means Guardian), <span id="fr_2988"></span>[2989](#fn_2988) may, I say,
not pass by him but tend and heal him. <span
id="fr_2989"></span>[2990](#fn_2989)

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xi-p12"></span>52. Perchance He therefore passes him
not by, because He sees in him some signs of life, so that there is hope
that he may recover. Does it not seem to you that he who has fallen is
half alive if faith sustains any breath of life? For he is dead who
wholly casts God out of his heart. He, then, who does not wholly cast
Him out, but under pressure of torments has denied Him for a time, is
half dead. Or if he be dead, why do you bid him repent, seeing he cannot
now be healed? If he be half dead, pour in oil and wine, not wine
without oil, that may be the comfort and the smart. Place him upon thy
beast, give him over to the host, lay out two pence for his cure, be to
him a neighbour. But you cannot be a neighbour unless you have
compassion on him; for no one can be called a neighbour unless he have
healed, not killed, another. But if you wish to be called a neighbour,
Christ says to you: “Go and do likewise.” <span

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xi-p10"></span> The Samaritans took their name from
the territory which they inhabited. But they called themselves Hebrew
\[Shomrim\], Guardians, that is, of the Law. This idea is referred to
here by St. Ambrose as elsewhere by others of the Fathers.

[Next: Chapter XII. Another passage of St. John is considered. The
necessity of keeping the commandments of God may be complied with by
those who, having fallen, repent, as well as by those who have not
fallen, as is shown in the case of David.](2100299)
