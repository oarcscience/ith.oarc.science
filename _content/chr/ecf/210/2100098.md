#### <span id="iv.i.iv.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.i.iv.iv-p1"></span>As it has been shown that he who injures
another for the sake of his own advantage will undergo terrible
punishment at the hand of his own conscience, it is referred that
nothing is useful to one which is not in the same way useful to all.
Thus there is no place among Christians for the question propounded by
the philosophers about two shipwrecked persons, for they must show love
and humility to all.

<span id="iv.i.iv.iv-p2"></span>24. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.iv-p2.1"></span>Hence</span> we infer <span
id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624) that a man who guides himself
according to the ruling of nature, so as to be obedient to her, can
never injure another. If he injures another, he violates nature, nor
will he think that what he has gained is so much an advantage as a
disadvantage. And what punishment is worse than the wounds of the
conscience within? What judgment harder than that of our hearts, whereby
each one stands convicted and accuses himself of the injury that he has
wrongfully done against his brother? This the Scriptures speak of very
plainly, saying: “Out of the mouth of fools there is a rod for
wrong-doing.” <span id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625) Folly, then, is
condemned because it causes wrong-doing. Ought we not rather to avoid
this, than death, or loss, or want, or exile, or sickness? Who would not
think some blemish of body or loss of inheritance far less than some
blemish of soul or loss of reputation?

<span id="iv.i.iv.iv-p5"></span>25. It is clear, then, <span
id="fr_626"></span>[627](#fn_626) that all must consider and hold that
the advantage of the individual is the same as that of all, and that
nothing must be considered advantageous except what is for the general
good. For how can one be benefited alone? That which is useless to all
is harmful. I certainly cannot think that he who is useless to all can
be of use to himself. For if there is one law of nature for all, there
is also one state of usefulness for all. And we are bound by the law of
nature to act for the good of all. It is not, therefore, right for him
who wishes the interests of another to be considered according to
nature, to injure him against the law of nature.

<span id="iv.i.iv.iv-p7"></span>26. For if those who run in a race <span
id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627) are, as one hears, instructed and
warned each one to win the race by swiftness of foot and not by any foul
play, and to hasten on to victory by running as hard as they can, but
not to dare to trip up another or push him aside with their hand, how
much more in the course of this life ought the victory to be won by us,
without falseness to another and cheating?

<span id="iv.i.iv.iv-p9"></span>27. Some ask <span
id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628) whether a wise man ought in case of a
shipwreck to take away a plank from an ignorant sailor? Although it
seems better for the common good that a wise man rather than a fool
should escape from shipwreck, yet I do not think that a Christian, a
just and a wise man, ought to save his own life by the death of another;
just as when he meets with an armed robber he cannot return his blows,
lest in defending his life he should stain his love toward his
neighbour. The verdict on this is plain and clear in the books of the
Gospel. “Put up thy sword, for every one that taketh the sword shall
perish with the sword.” <span id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629) What
robber is more hateful than the persecutor who came to kill Christ? But
Christ would <span id="page_72">p. 72</span> <span
id="iv.i.iv.iv-Page_72"></span>not be defended from the wounds of the
persecutor, for He willed to heal all by His wounds.

<span id="iv.i.iv.iv-p12"></span>28. Why dost thou consider thyself
greater than another, when a Christian man ought to put others before
himself, to claim nothing for himself, usurp no honours, claim no reward
for his merits? Why, next, art thou not wont to bear thy own troubles
rather than to destroy another’s advantage? For what is so contrary to
nature as not to be content with what one has or to seek what is
another’s, and to try to get it in shameful ways. For if a virtuous life
is in accordance with nature—for God made all things very good—then
shameful living must be opposed to it. A virtuous and a shameful life
cannot go together, since they are absolutely severed by the law of
nature.

[Next: Chapter V. The upright does nothing that is contrary to duty,
even though there is a hope of keeping it secret. To point this out the
tale about the ring of Gyges was invented by the philosophers. Exposing
this, he brings forward known and true examples from the life of David
and John the Baptist.](2100099)
