#### <span id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p1"></span>Judith, after enduring many dangers
for virtue’s sake, gained very many and great benefits.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p2"></span>82. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p2.1"></span>See</span>! Judith presents herself to
thee as worthy of admiration. She approaches Holophernes, a man feared
by the people, and surrounded by the victorious troops of the Assyrians.
At first she makes an impression on him by the grace of her form and the
beauty of her countenance. Then she entraps him by the refinement of her
speech. Her first triumph was that she returned from the tent of the
enemy with her purity unspotted. <span id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688)
Her second, that she gained a victory over a man, and put to flight the
people by her counsel.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p4"></span>83. The Persians were terrified at her
daring. <span id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689) And so what is admired
in the case of those two Pythagoreans deserves also in her case our
admiration, for she trembled not at the danger of death, nor even at the
danger her modesty was in, which is a matter of greater concern to good
women. She feared not the blow of one scoundrel, nor even the weapons of
a whole army. She, a woman, stood between the lines of the
combatants—right amidst victorious arms—heedless of death. As one looks
at her overwhelming danger, one would say she went out to die; as one
looks at her faith, one says she went but out to fight.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p6"></span>84. Judith then followed the call of
virtue, and as she follows that, she wins great benefits. It was
virtuous to prevent the people of the Lord from giving themselves up to
the heathen; to prevent them from betraying their native rites and
mysteries, or from yielding up their consecrated virgins, their
venerable widows, and modest matrons to barbarian impurity, or from
ending the siege by a surrender. It was virtuous for her to be willing
to encounter danger on behalf of all, so as to deliver all from danger.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p7"></span>85. How great must have been the power
of her virtue, that she, a woman, should claim to give counsel on the
chiefest matters and not leave it in the hands of the leaders of the
people! How great, again, the power of her virtue to reckon for certain
upon God to help her! How great her grace to find His help!

[Next: Chapter XIV. How virtuous and useful was that which Elisha did.
This is compared with that oft-recounted act of the Greeks. John gave up
his life for virtue's sake, and Susanna for the same reason exposed
herself to the danger of death.](2100108)
