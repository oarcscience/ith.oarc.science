<span id="iv.vi.iii.xi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p1"></span>The possibility of repentance is a
reason why baptism should not be deferred to old age, a practice which
is against the will of God in holy Scripture. But it is of no use to
practise penance whilst still serving lusts. These must be first
subdued.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p2"></span>98. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p2.1"></span>Good</span>, then, is penitence, and if
there were no place for it, every one would defer the grace of cleansing
by baptism to old age. And a sufficient reason is that it is better, to
have a robe to mend, than none to put on; but as that which has been
repaired once is restored, so that which is frequently mended is
destroyed.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p3"></span>99. And the Lord has given a
sufficient warning to those who put off repentance, when He says:
“Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” <span
id="fr_3145"></span>[3146](#fn_3145) We know not at what hour the thief
will come, we know not whether our soul may be required of us this next
night. God cast Adam out of Paradise immediately after his fault; there
was no delay. At once the fallen were severed from all their enjoyments
that they might do penance; at once God clothed them with garments of
skins, not of silk. <span id="fr_3146"></span>[3147](#fn_3146)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p6"></span>100. And what reason is there for
putting <span id="page_358">p. 358</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iii.xi-Page_358"></span>off? Is it that you may sin yet more?
Then because God is good you are evil, and “despise the riches of His
goodness and long-suffering.” <span id="fr_3147"></span>[3148](#fn_3147)
But the goodness of the Lord ought rather to draw you to repentance.
Wherefore holy David says to all: “Come, let us worship and fall down
before Him, and mourn before our Lord Who made us.” <span
id="fr_3148"></span>[3149](#fn_3148) But for a sinner who has died
without repentance, because nothing remains but to mourn grievously and
to weep, you find him groaning and saying: “O my son Absalom! my son
Absalom!” <span id="fr_3149"></span>[3150](#fn_3149) For him who is
wholly dead mourning is without alleviation.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p10"></span>101. But of those who as exiles and
banished from their ancestral homes, which the holy law of Moses had
assigned them, will be entangled in the errors of the world, you hear
him saying: “By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept, when we
remembered Zion.” <span id="fr_3150"></span>[3151](#fn_3150) He sets
forth the wailings of those who have fallen, and shows that they who are
living in this condition of passing time and changing circumstances
ought to repent, after the example of those who, as a reward for sin,
had been led into miserable captivity.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p12"></span>102. But nothing causes such
exceeding grief as when any one, lying under the captivity of sin, calls
to mind whence he has fallen, because he turned aside to carnal and
earthly things, instead of directing his mind in the beautiful ways of
the knowledge of God.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p13"></span>103. So you find Adam concealing
himself, when he knew that God was present, and wishing to be hidden
when called by God with that voice which wounded the soul of him who was
hiding: “Adam, where art thou?” <span
id="fr_3151"></span>[3152](#fn_3151) That is to say, Wherefore hidest
thou thyself? Why art thou concealed? Why dost thou avoid Him, Whom thou
once didst long to see? A guilty conscience is so burdensome that it
punishes itself without a judge, and wishes for covering, and yet is
bare before God.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p15"></span>104. And so no one in a state of sin
ought to claim a right to or the use of the sacraments, for it is
written: “Thou hast sinned, be still.” <span
id="fr_3152"></span>[3153](#fn_3152) As David says in the Psalm lately
quoted: “We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof;” and
again: “How shall we sing the Lord’s song in a strange land?” <span
id="fr_3153"></span>[3154](#fn_3153) For if the flesh wars against the
mind, and is not subject to the guidance of the Spirit, that is a
strange land which is not subdued by the toil of the cultivator, and so
cannot produce the fruits of charity, patience, and peace. It is better,
then, to be still when you cannot practise the works of repentance, lest
in the very acts of repentance there be that which afterward will need
further repentance. For if it be once entered upon and not rightly
carried out, it obtains not the result of a first repentance and takes
away the use of a later one. <span id="fr_3154"></span>[3155](#fn_3154)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p19"></span>105. When, then, the flesh resists,
the soul must be intent upon God, and if results do not follow, let not
faith fail. And if the enticements of the flesh come upon us, or the
powers of the enemy attack us, let the soul keep in submission to God.
For we are then specially oppressed when the flesh yields. And some
there are who trouble heavily the wretched soul, seeking to deprive it
of all protection. To which case the words apply: “Rase it, rase it,
even to the foundations.” <span id="fr_3155"></span>[3156](#fn_3155)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p21"></span>106. And David, pitying her, says: “O
wretched daughter of Babylon.” <span
id="fr_3156"></span>[3157](#fn_3156) Wretched indeed, as being the
daughter of Babylon, when she ceased to be the daughter of
Jerusalem. <span id="fr_3157"></span>[3158](#fn_3157) And yet he calls
for a healer for her, and says: “Blessed is he who shall take thy little
ones and dash them against the rock.” <span
id="fr_3158"></span>[3159](#fn_3158) That is to say, shall dash all
corrupt and filthy thoughts against Christ, Who by His fear and His
rebuke will break down all motions against reason, so as, if any one is
seized by an adulterous love, to extinguish the fire, that he may by his
zeal put away the love of a harlot, and deny himself that he may gain
Christ.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p25"></span>107. We have then learned that we
must do penance, and this at a time when the heat of luxury and sin is
giving way; and that we, when under the dominion of sin, must show
ourselves Godfearing by refraining, rather than allowing ourselves in
evil practices. For if it is said to Moses when he was desiring to draw
nearer: “Put off thy shoes from off thy feet,” <span
id="fr_3159"></span>[3160](#fn_3159) how much <span id="page_359">p.
359</span> <span id="iv.vi.iii.xi-Page_359"></span>more must we free the
feet of our soul from the bonds of the body, and clear our steps from
all connection with this world.

\[LXX.\]. These words occur in the Septuagint only, and would seem to be
taken here by St. Ambrose as a warning from God to Cain, not to
sacrifice whilst in sin, and so be applied to those sinners whom he
enjoins not to communicate before they repent.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p18"></span> I do not feel sure of the meaning of
this passage, but it appears to be as above, that a person going through
the outward exercises of penance without inward repentance, gains no
benefit, and as sinners were not admitted to a second course of penance,
does away with his chance for the future. \[<span class="sc"><span

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xi-p23"></span> This passage is another instance of
the way in which St. Ambrose, like many other early writers, lost sight
of the original meaning of the text in drawing allegorical lessons from
it. The “daughter of Babylon,” *i.e.* the people, had never been a
“daughter of God,” nor was the dashing of the children against the rock
ever intended to bear the beautiful interpretation given to it by our
author.
