#### <span id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p1"></span>The Holy Spirit is no less the
author of spiritual creation or regeneration than the Father and the
Son. The excellence of that creation, and wherein it consists. How we
are to understand holy Scripture, when it attributes a body or members
to God.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p2"></span>62. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p2.1"></span>So</span>, then, the Father creates in
good works, and the Son also, for it is written: “But as many as
received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to
them who believe on His Name; who were born not of blood, nor of the
will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.” <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p4"></span>63. In like manner the Lord Himself
also testifies that we are born again of the Spirit according to grace,
saying: “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, because it is born of
flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit, because God is
Spirit. Marvel not that I said unto you, Ye must be born again. The
Spirit breatheth <span id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086) where He
willeth, and thou hearest His voice, but knowest not whence He cometh or
whither He goeth, so is every one who is born of the Spirit.”

<span id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p6"></span>64. It is then clear that the Holy
Spirit is also the Author of the grace of the Spirit, since we are
created according to God, that we may be made the sons of God. So when
He has taken us into His kingdom by the adoption of holy regeneration,
do we deny Him that which is His? He has made us heirs of the new birth
from above, do we claim the heritage and reject its Author? But the
benefit cannot remain <span id="page_123">p. 123</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii.viii-Page_123"></span>when its Author is shut out; the
Author is not without the gift, nor the gift without the Author. If you
claim the grace, believe the power; if you reject the power, do not ask
for the grace. He who has denied the Spirit has at the same time denied
the gift. For if the Author be of no account how can His gifts be
precious? Why do we grudge the gifts we ourselves receive, diminish our
hopes, repudiate our dignity, and deny our Comforter?

<span id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p7"></span>65. But we cannot deny Him. Far be
it from us to deny that which is so great, since the Apostle says: “But
ye brethren, like Isaac, are the children of promise, but as then, he
that is born after the flesh persecutes him that is after the
Spirit.” <span id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087) Again certainly is
understood from what has gone before, is born after the Spirit. He then
who is born after the Spirit is born after God. Now we are born again
when we are renewed in our inward affections and lay aside the oldness
of the outer man. And so the Apostle says again: “But be ye renewed in
the spirit of your mind, and put on the new man which is created
according to God in truth and righteousness and holiness.” <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088) Let them hear how the Scripture has
signified the unity of the divine operation. He who is renewed in the
spirit of his mind has put on the new man, which is created according to
God.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p10"></span>66. That more excellent
regeneration is then the work of the Holy Spirit; and the Spirit is the
Author of that new man which is created after the image of God, which no
one will doubt to be better than this outer man of ours. Since the
Apostle has pointed out that the one is heavenly, the other earthly,
when he says: “As is the heavenly, such also are the heavenly.” <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p12"></span>67. Since, then, the grace of the
Spirit makes that to be heavenly which it can create earthy, we ought to
observe by reason though we be without instances. For in a certain place
holy Job says: “As the Lord liveth, Who thus judgeth me, and the
Almighty, Who hath brought my soul to bitterness (for the Spirit of God
which is in my nostrils).” <span id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090) He
certainly did not here signify by His Spirit the vital breath and bodily
breathing passages, but signifies the nostrils of the inner man within
him, wherewith he gathered in the fragrance of eternal life, and drew in
the grace of the heavenly ointment as with a kind of twofold sense.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p14"></span>68. For there are spiritual
nostrils, as we read, which the spouse of the Word has, to whom it is
said: “And the smell of thy nostrils;” <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091) and in another place: “The Lord
smelled a smell of sweetness.” <span
id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092) There are, then, as it were, inward
members of a man, whose hands are considered to be in action, his ears
in hearing, his feet in a kind of progress in a good work. And so from
what is done we gather as it were figures of the members, for it is not
suitable for us to imagine anything in the inner man after a fleshly
manner.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p17"></span>69. And there are some who suppose
that God is fashioned after a bodily manner, when they read of His hand
or finger, and they do not observe that these things are written not
because of any fashion of a body, since in the Godhead are neither
members nor parts, but are expressions of the oneness of the Godhead,
that we may believe that it is impossible for either the Son or the Holy
Spirit to be separated from God the Father; since the fulness of the
Godhead dwells as it were bodily in the substance of the Trinity. For
this reason, then, is the Son also called the Right Hand of the Father,
as we read: “The Right Hand of the Lord hath done mighty things, the
Right Hand of the Lord hath exalted me.” <span

<span id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p5"></span> It has been thought well in
translating this verse to keep the words “spirit” and “breath” as
suiting the argument of St. Ambrose. But there can be little doubt that
the ordinary translation is the correct one. Bp. Westcott has the
following note: “In Hebrew, Syriac, and Latin the words \[for spirit and
wind\] are identical, and Wiclif and the Rhemish version keep “spirit”
in both cases, after the Latin. But at present the retention of one word
in both places could only create confusion, since the separation between
the material emblem and the power which it was used to describe is
complete. The use of the correlative verb (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p5.1"></span>πνεῖ</span>, [John
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#018), [Rev.

id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p5.2"></span>) and of the word *sound* (voice) is
quite decisive for the literal use of the noun (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p5.3"></span>πνεῦμα</span>), and
still at the same time the whole of the phraseology is inspired by the
higher meaning. Perhaps also the unusual word (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p5.4"></span>πνεῦμα</span>, [1 Kings
18:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#045), [1 Kings

3:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#017)<span
id="iv.ii.iii.viii-p5.5"></span>) is employed to suggest this. The
comparison lies between the obvious physical properties of the wind and
the mysterious action of that spiritual influence to which the name
“spirit,” “wind,” was instinctively applied. The laws of both are
practically unknown, both are unseen, the presence of both is revealed
in their effects.”—Westcott on S. [John iii.

[Next: Chapter VIII. St. Ambrose examines and refutes the heretical
argument that because God is said to be glorified in the Spirit, and not
with the Spirit, the Holy Spirit is therefore inferior to the Father. He
shows that the particle in can be also used of the Son and even of the
Father, and that on the other hand with may be said of creatures without
any infringement on the prerogatives of the Godhead; and that in reality
these prepositions simply imply the connection of the Three Divine
Persons.](2100146)
