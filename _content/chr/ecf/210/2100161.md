#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.ix-p1"></span>That the Holy Spirit is provoked is
proved by the words of St. Peter, in which it is shown that the Spirit
of God is one and the same as the Spirit of the Lord, both by other
passages and by reference to the sentence of the same Apostle on Ananias
and Sapphira, whence it is argued that the union of the Holy Spirit with
the Father and the Son, as well as His own Godhead, is proved.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.ix-p2"></span>54. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.ix-p2.1"></span>Perhaps</span>, however, some one might say
that this passage cannot be specially applied to the Holy Spirit, had
not the same Apostle Peter taught us in another place that the Holy
Ghost can be tempted by our sins, for you find that the wife of Ananias
is thus addressed: “Why have ye agreed together to tempt the Spirit of
the Lord?” <span id="fr_1297"></span>[1298](#fn_1297) For the Spirit of
the Lord is the very Spirit of God; for there is one Holy Spirit, as
also the Apostle Paul taught, saying: “But ye are not in the flesh, but
in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. But if
any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.” <span
id="fr_1298"></span>[1299](#fn_1298) He first mentioned the Spirit of
God and immediately adds that the Same is the Spirit of Christ. And
having spoken of the Spirit, that we might understand that where the
Holy Spirit is there is Christ, he added: “But if Christ be in
you.” <span id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.ix-p6"></span>55. Then, in the same way as we here
understand that where the Spirit is there also is Christ; so also,
elsewhere, he shows that where Christ is, there also is the Holy Spirit.
For having said: “Do ye seek a proof of Christ Who speaketh in
me?” <span id="fr_1300"></span>[1301](#fn_1300) he says elsewhere: “For
I think that I also <span id="page_143">p. 143</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iv.ix-Page_143"></span>have the Spirit of God.” <span
id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301) The Unity, then, is inseparable,
for by the testimony of Scripture where either the Father or the Son or
the Holy Spirit is designated, there is all the fulness of the Trinity.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.ix-p9"></span>56. But Peter himself in the instance
we have brought forward spoke first of the Holy Spirit, and then called
Him the Spirit of the Lord, for you read as follows: “Ananias, why hath
Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to deal
fraudulently concerning the price of the field? While it remained did it
not continue thine own, and when sold was it not in thy power? Why hast
thou conceived this wickedness in thy heart? Thou hast not lied unto men
but unto God.” <span id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302) And below he
says to the wife: “Why have ye agreed together to tempt the Spirit of
the Lord?” <span id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.ix-p12"></span>57. First, we understand that he
called the Holy Spirit the Spirit of the Lord. Then, since he mentioned
first the Holy Spirit and added: “Thou hast not lied unto men but unto
God,” you must necessarily either understand the oneness of the Godhead
in the Holy Spirit, since when the Holy Spirit is tempted a lie is told
to God; or, if you endeavour to exclude the oneness of the Godhead, you
yourself according to the words of Scripture certainly believe Him to be
God.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.ix-p13"></span>58. For if we understand that these
expressions are used both of the Spirit and of the Father, we certainly
observe the unity of truth and knowledge in God the Father and the Holy
Spirit, for falsehood is discovered alike by the Holy Spirit and by God
the Father. But if we have received each truth concerning the Spirit,
why do you, faithless man, attempt to deny what you read? Confess, then,
either the oneness of the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the
Holy Spirit, or the Godhead of the Holy Spirit. Whichever you say, you
will have said each in God, for both the Unity upholds the Godhead and
the Godhead the Unity

[Next: Chapter X. The Divinity of the Holy Spirit is supported by a
passage of St. John. This passage was, indeed, erased by heretics, but
it is a vain attempt, since their faithlessness could thereby more
easily be convicted. The order of the context is considered in order
that this passage may be shown to refer to the Spirit. He is born of the
Spirit who is born again of the same Spirit, of Whom Christ Himself is
believed to have been born and born again. Again, the Godhead of the
Spirit is inferred from two testimonies of St. John; and lastly, it is
explained how the Spirit, the water, and the blood are called
witnesses.](2100162)
