<span id="iv.i.ii.xvi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xvi-p1"></span>To confirm what has been said above
about rewards and punishments, he adds that it is not strange if there
is no reward reserved for some in the future; for they do not labour
here nor struggle. He goes on to say also that for this reason temporal
goods are granted to these persons, so that they may have no excuse
whatever.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xvi-p2"></span>59. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xvi-p2.1"></span>Is</span> not he unjust who gives the
reward before the end of the contest? Therefore the Lord says in the
Gospel: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven.” <span id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100) He said not: “Blessed
are the rich,” but “the poor.” By the divine judgment blessedness begins
there whence human misery is supposed to spring. “Blessed are they that
hunger, for they shall be filled; Blessed are they that mourn, for they
shall be comforted; Blessed are the merciful, for God will have mercy on
them; Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God; Blessed are
they that are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven; Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and
persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you for
righteousness’ sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for plentiful is
your reward in heaven.” <span id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101) A reward
future and not present,—in heaven, not on earth,—has He promised shall
be given. What further dost thou expect? What further is due? Why dost
thou demand the crown with so much haste, before thou dost conquer? Why
dost thou desire to shake off the dust and to rest? Why dost thou long
to sit at the feast before the course is finished? As yet the people are
looking on, the athletes are in the arena, and thou—dost thou already
look for ease?

<span id="iv.i.ii.xvi-p5"></span>60. Perhaps thou sayest: Why are the
wicked joyous? why do they live in luxury? why do they not toil with me?
It is because they who have not put down their names to strive for the
crown are not bound to undergo the labours of the contest. They who have
not gone down into the race-course do not anoint themselves with oil nor
get covered with dust. For those whom glory awaits trouble is at hand.
The perfumed spectators are wont to look on, not to join in the
struggle, nor to endure the sun, the heat, the dust, and the showers.
Let the athletes say to them: Come, strive with us. The spectators will
but answer: We sit here now to decide about you, but you, if you
conquer, will gain the glory of the crown and we shall not.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xvi-p6"></span>61. They, then, who have devoted
themselves to pleasures, luxury, robbery, gain, or honours are
spectators rather than combatants. They have the profit of labour, but
not the fruits of virtue. They love their ease; by cunning and
wickedness they heap up riches; but they will pay the penalty of their
iniquity, though it be late. Their rest will be in hell, thine in
heaven; their home in the grave, thine in paradise. Whence Job said
beautifully that they watch in the tomb, <span
id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102) for they cannot have the calm of quiet
rest which he enjoys who shall rise again.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xvi-p8"></span>62. Do not, therefore, understand, or
speak, or think as a child; nor as a child claim those things now which
belong to a future time. The crown belongs to the perfect. Wait till
that which is perfect is come, when thou mayest know—not through a glass
as in a riddle, but face to face <span id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103)
—the very form of truth made clear. Then will be made known why that
person was rich who was wicked and a robber of other men’s goods, why
another was powerful, why a third had many children, and yet a fourth
was loaded with honours.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xvi-p10"></span>63. Perhaps all this happens that the
question may be asked of the robber: Thou <span id="page_12">p.
12</span> <span id="iv.i.ii.xvi-Page_12"></span>wast rich, wherefore
didst thou seize on the goods of others? Need did not force thee,
poverty did not drive thee to it. Did I not make thee rich, that thou
mightest have no excuse? So, too, it may be said to a person of power:
Why didst thou not aid the widow, the orphans also, when enduring wrong?
Wast thou powerless? Couldst thou not help? I made thee for this
purpose, not that thou mightest do wrong, but that thou mightest check
it. Is it not written for thee “Save him that endureth wrong?” <span
id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104) Is it not written for thee: “Deliver
the poor and needy out of the hand of the sinner”? <span
id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105) It may be said also to the man who has
abundance of good things: I have blessed thee with children and honours;
I have granted thee health of body; why didst thou not follow my
commands? My servant, what have I done to thee, or how have I grieved
thee? Was it not I that gave thee children, bestowed honours, granted
health to thee? Why didst thou deny me? Why didst thou suppose that thy
actions would not come to my knowledge? Why didst thou accept my gifts,
yet despise my commands?

<span id="iv.i.ii.xvi-p13"></span>64. We can gather the same from the
example of the traitor Judas. He was chosen among the Twelve Apostles,
and had charge of the money bag, to lay it out upon the poor, <span
id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106) that it might not seem as though he
had betrayed the Lord because he was unhonoured or in want. Wherefore
the Lord granted him this office, that He might also be justified in
him; he would be guilty of a greater fault, not as one driven to it by
wrong done to him, but as one misusing grace.
