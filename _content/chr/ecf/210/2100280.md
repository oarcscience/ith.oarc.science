### <span id="iv.v.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.v.vi-p1"></span>Christ is Himself present in Baptism, so
that we need not consider the person of His ministers. A brief
explanation of the confession of the Trinity as usually uttered by those
about to be baptized.

<span id="iv.v.vi-p2"></span>26. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vi-p2.1"></span>Is</span> there, then, here any room left for
doubt, when the Father clearly calls from heaven in the Gospel
narrative, and says: “This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am well
pleased”? <span id="fr_2857"></span>[2858](#fn_2857) When the Son also
speaks, upon Whom the Holy Spirit showed Himself in the likeness of a
dove? When the Holy Spirit also speaks, Who came down in the likeness of
a dove? When David, too, speaks: “The voice of the Lord is above the
waters, the God of glory thundered, the Lord above many waters”? <span
id="fr_2858"></span>[2859](#fn_2858) When Scripture testifies that at
the prayer of Jerubbaal, fire came down from heaven, <span
id="fr_2859"></span>[2860](#fn_2859) and again, when Elijah prayed, fire
was sent forth and consecrated the sacrifice. <span
id="fr_2860"></span>[2861](#fn_2860)

<span id="iv.v.vi-p7"></span>27. Do not consider the merits of
individuals, but the office of the priests. Or, if you look at the
merits, consider the priest as Elijah. Look upon the merits of Peter
also, or of Paul, who handed down to us this mystery which they had
received of the Lord Jesus. To those \[of old\] a visible fire was sent
that they might believe; for us who believe, the Lord works invisibly;
for them that happened for a figure, for us for warning. Believe, then,
that the Lord Jesus is present at the invocation of the priest, Who
said: “Where two or three are, there am I also.” <span
id="fr_2861"></span>[2862](#fn_2861) <span id="page_321">p. 321</span>
<span id="iv.v.vi-Page_321"></span>How much where the Church is, and
where His Mysteries are, does He vouchsafe to impart His presence!

<span id="iv.v.vi-p9"></span>28. You went down, then (into the water),
remember what you replied to the questions, that you believe in the
Father, that you believe in the Son, that you believe in the Holy
Spirit. The statement there is not: I believe in a greater and in a less
and in a lowest person, but you are bound by the same guarantee of your
own voice, to believe in the Son in like manner as you believe in the
Father; and to believe in the Holy Spirit in like manner as you believe
in the Son, with this one exception, that you confess that you must
believe in the cross of the Lord Jesus alone.
