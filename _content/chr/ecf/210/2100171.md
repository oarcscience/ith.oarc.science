<span id="iv.ii.iv.xix"></span>

#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xix-p1"></span>Having proved above that the Spirit
abides and speaks in the prophets, St. Ambrose infers that He knows all
things which are of God, and therefore is One with the Father and the
Son. This same point he establishes again from the fact that He
possesses all that God possesses, namely, Godhead, knowledge of the
heart, truth, a Name above every name, and power to raise the dead, as
is proved from Ezekiel, and in this He is equal to the Son.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xix-p2"></span>144. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.xix-p2.1"></span>And so</span> as the Father and the Son
are One, because the Son has all things which the Father has, so too the
Spirit is one with the Father and the Son, because He too knows all the
things of God. For He did not obtain it by force, so that there should
be any injury as of one who had suffered loss; He did not seize it, lest
the loss should be his from whom it might seem to have been plundered.
For neither did He seize it through need, nor through superiority of
greater power did He take it by force, but He possesses it by unity of
power. Therefore, if He works all these things, for one and the same
Spirit worketh all, <span id="fr_1418"></span>[1419](#fn_1418) how is He
not God Who has all things which God has?

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xix-p4"></span>145. Or let us consider what God may
have which the Holy Spirit has not. God the Father has Godhead, and the
Son, too, in Whom dwells the fulness of the Godhead, has it, and the
Spirit has it, for it is written: “The Spirit of God is in my
nostrils.” <span id="fr_1419"></span>[1420](#fn_1419)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xix-p6"></span>146. God, again, searches the hearts
and reins, for it is written: “God searcheth the hearts and
reins.” <span id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420) The Son also has this
power, Who said, “Why think ye evil in your hearts?” <span
id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421) For Jesus knew their thoughts. And
the Spirit has the same power, Who manifests to the prophets also the
secrets of the hearts of others, as we said above: “for the secrets of
his heart are made manifest.” And why do we wonder if He searches the
hidden things of man Who searches even the deep things of God?

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xix-p9"></span>147. God has as an attribute that He
is true for it is written: “Let God be true and every man a liar.” <span
id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422) Does the Spirit lie Who is the
Spirit of Truth? <span id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423) and Whom we
<span id="page_156">p. 156</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iv.xix-Page_156"></span>have shown to be called the Truth,
since John called Him too the Truth, as also the Son? And David says in
the psalm: “Send out Thy light and Thy truth, they have led me and
brought me to Thy holy hill and to Thy tabernacles.” <span
id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424) If you consider that in this
passage the Son is the light, then the Spirit is the Truth, or if you
consider the Son to be the Truth, then the Spirit is the light.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xix-p13"></span>148. God has a Name which is above
every name, and has given a name to the Son, as we read that in the Name
of Jesus knees should bow. Let us consider whether the Spirit has this
Name. But it is written “Go, baptize the nations in the Name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425) He has, then, a Name above every
name. What, therefore, the Father and the Son have, the Holy Spirit also
has through the oneness of the Name of His nature.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xix-p15"></span>149. It is a prerogative of God to
raise the dead. “For as the Father raiseth the dead and quickeneth them,
so the Son also quickeneth whom He will.” <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426) But the Spirit also (by Whom God
raiseth) raiseth them, for it is written: “He shall quicken also your
mortal bodies through His Spirit that dwelleth in you.” <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427) But that you may not think this a
trivial grace, learn that the Spirit also raises, for the prophet
Ezekiel says: “Come, O Spirit, and breathe upon these dead, and they
shall live. And I prophesied as He commanded me, and the Spirit of life
entered into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet an
exceeding great company.” <span id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428) And
farther on God says: “Ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall
open your graves, that I may bring My people out of their graves, and I
will give you My Spirit, and ye shall live.” <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xix-p20"></span>150. When He spoke of His Spirit, did
He mention any other besides the Holy Spirit? For He would neither have
spoken of His Spirit as produced by blowing, nor could this Spirit come
from the four quarters of the world, for the blowing of these winds,
which we experience, is partial, not universal; and this spirit by which
we live is also individual, not universal. But it is the nature of the
Holy Spirit to be both over all and in all. Therefore from the words of
the prophet we may see how (the frame-work of the members long since
fallen asunder being scattered) the bones may come together again to the
form of a revived body, when the Spirit quickens them; and the ashes may
come together on the limbs belonging to them, animated by a disposition
to come together before being formed anew in the appearance of living.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xix-p21"></span>151. Do we not in the likeness of
what is done recognize the oneness of the divine power? The Spirit
raises after the same manner as the Lord raised at the time of His own
Passion, when suddenly in the twinkling of an eye the graves of the dead
were opened, and the bodies living again arose from the tombs, and the
smell of death being removed, and the scent of life restored, the ashes
of those who were dead took again the likeness of the living.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xix-p22"></span>152. So, then, the Spirit has that
which Christ has, and therefore what God has, for all things which the
Father has the Son also has, and therefore He said: “All things which
the Father hath are Mine.” <span id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430)

[Next: Chapter XX. The river flowing from the Throne of God is a figure
of the Holy Spirit, but by the waters spoken of by David the powers of
heaven are intended. The kingdom of God is the work of the Spirit; and
it is no matter for wonder if He reigns in this together with the Son,
since St. Paul promises that we too shall reign with the Son.](2100172)
