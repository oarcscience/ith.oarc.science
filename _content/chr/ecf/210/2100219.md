#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xv-p1"></span>The sentence of the Judge is set forth,
the counterpleas of the opposers are considered, and the finality of the
sentence, from which there is no appeal, proved.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xv-p2"></span>123. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xv-p2.1"></span>What</span> verdict do we look for from
Christ? That do I know. Do I say, what verdict *will* He give? Nay, He
hath already pronounced sentence. We have it in our hands. “Let all,”
saith He, “honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that
honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, Who hath sent
Him.” <span id="fr_2071"></span>[2072](#fn_2071)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xv-p4"></span>124. If the sentence please you not,
appeal to the Father, cancel the judgment that the Father hath given.
Say that He hath a Son Who is unlike Him. He will reply: “Then have I
lied, I, Who said to the Son, ‘Let us make man in Our image and
likeness.’” <span id="fr_2072"></span>[2073](#fn_2072)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xv-p6"></span>125. Tell the Father that He hath
created <span id="page_240">p. 240</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iv.xv-Page_240"></span>the Son, and He will answer: “Why,
then, hast thou worshipped One Whom thou thoughtest to be a created
being?”

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xv-p7"></span>126. Tell Him that He hath begotten a
Son Who is inferior to Himself, and He will reply: “Compare Us, and let
Us see.”

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xv-p8"></span>127. Tell Him that you owed no credence
to the Son, whereto He will answer: “Did I not say to thee, ‘This is My
well-beloved Son, in Whom I am well pleased: hear ye Him’?” <span
id="fr_2073"></span>[2074](#fn_2073) What mean these words “hear ye
Him,” if not “Hear Him when He saith: ‘All things that the Father hath
are Mine’”? <span id="fr_2074"></span>[2075](#fn_2074) This did the
apostles hear, even as it is written: “And they fell upon their faces,
and were greatly afraid.” <span id="fr_2075"></span>[2076](#fn_2075) If
they who confessed Him fell to the earth, what shall they do who have
denied Him? But Jesus laid His hand upon His apostles, and raised them
up—you He will suffer to lie prone, that ye may see not the glory ye
have denied.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xv-p12"></span>128. Let us look to it, then,
forasmuch as whom the Son condemneth, the Father condemneth also, and
therefore let us honour the Son, even as we honour the Father, that by
the Son we may be able to come to the Father.

[Next: Chapter XV. St. Ambrose deprecates any praise of his own merits:
in any case, the Faith is sufficiently defended by the authoritative
support of holy Scripture, to whose voice the Arians, stubborn as the
Jews, are deaf. He prays that they may be moved to love the truth;
meanwhile, they are to be avoided, as heretics and enemies of
Christ.](2100220)
