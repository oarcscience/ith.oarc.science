<span id="iv.i.ii.x"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.i.ii.x-p1"></span>What is seemly is often found in the
sacred writings long before it appears in the books of the philosophers.
Pythagoras borrowed the law of his silence from David. David’s rule,
however, is the best, for our first duty is to have due measure in
speaking.

<span id="iv.i.ii.x-p2"></span>30. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.x-p2.1"></span>We</span> are instructed and taught that
“what is seemly” <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64) is put in our
Scriptures in the first place. (In Greek it is called <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.i.ii.x-p3.1"></span>πρέπον</span>.) For we
read: “A Hymn beseems Thee, O God, in Sion.” In Greek this is: <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.i.ii.x-p3.2"></span>Σοί πρέπει ὕμνος ὁ θεὸς
ἐν Σιών</span>. <span id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65) And the Apostle
says: “Speak the things which become sound doctrine.” <span
id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66) And elsewhere: “For it beseemed Him
through Whom are all things and for Whom are all things, in bringing
many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect
through sufferings.” <span id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67)

<span id="iv.i.ii.x-p7"></span>31. Was Panætius or Aristotle, who also
wrote on duty, earlier than David? Why, Pythagoras himself, who lived
before the time of Socrates, followed the prophet David’s steps and gave
his disciples a law of silence. He went so far as to restrain his
disciples from the use of speech for five years. David, on the other
hand, gave his law, not with a view to impair the gift of nature, but to
teach us to take heed to the words we utter. Pythagoras again made his
rule, that he might teach men to speak by not speaking. But David made
his, so that by speaking we might learn the more how to speak. How can
there be instruction without exercise, or advance without practice?

<span id="iv.i.ii.x-p8"></span>32. A man wishing to undergo a warlike
training daily exercises himself with his weapons. As though ready for
action he rehearses his part in the fight and stands forth just as if
the enemy were in position before him. Or, with a view to acquiring
skill and strength in throwing the javelin, he either puts his own arms
to the proof, or avoids the blows of his foes, and escapes them by his
watchful attention. The man that desires to navigate a ship on the sea,
or to row, tries first on a river. They who wish to acquire an agreeable
style of singing and a beautiful voice begin by bringing out their voice
gradually by singing. And they who seek to win the crown of victory by
strength of body and in a regular wrestling match, harden their limbs by
daily practice in the wrestling school, foster their endurance, and
accustom themselves to hard work.

<span id="iv.i.ii.x-p9"></span>33. Nature herself teaches us this in the
case of infants. For they first exercise themselves in the sounds of
speech and so learn to speak. Thus these sounds of speech are a kind of
practice, and a school for the voice. Let those then who want to learn
to take heed in speaking not refuse what is according to nature, but let
them use all watchful care; just as those who are on a watch-tower keep
on the alert by watching, and not by going to sleep. For everything is
made more perfect and strong by exercises proper and suitable to itself.

<span id="iv.i.ii.x-p10"></span>34. David, therefore, was not always
silent, but only for a time; not perpetually nor to all did he refuse to
speak; but he used not to answer the enemy that provoked him, the sinner
that exasperated him. As he says elsewhere: “As though he were deaf he
heard not them that speak vanity and imagine deceit: and as though he
were dumb he opened not his mouth to them.” <span
id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68) Again, in another place, it is said:
“Answer <span id="page_7">p. 7</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.x-Page_7"></span>not a fool according to his folly, lest
thou also be like to him.” <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69)

<span id="iv.i.ii.x-p13"></span>35. The first duty then is to have due
measure in our speech. In this way a sacrifice of praise is offered up
to God; thus a godly fear is shown when the sacred Scriptures are read;
thus parents are honoured. I know well that many speak because they know
not how to keep silence. But it is not often any one is silent when
speaking does not profit him. A wise man, intending to speak, first
carefully considers what he is to say, and to whom he is to say it; also
where and at what time. There is therefore such a thing as due measure
in keeping silence and also in speaking; there is also such a thing as a
due measure in what we do. It is a glorious thing to maintain the right
standard of duty.

[Next: Chapter XI. It is proved by the witness of Scripture that all
duty is either “ordinary” or “perfect.” To which is added a word in
praise of mercy, and an exhortation to practise it.](2100023)
