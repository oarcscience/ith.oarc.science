<span id="iv.iv.v.vii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.v.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iv.v.vii-p1"></span>Solomon’s words, “The Lord created Me,”
etc., mean that Christ’s Incarnation was done for the redemption of the
Father’s creation, as is shown by the Son’s own words. That He is the
“beginning” may be understood from the visible proofs of His
virtuousness, and it is shown how the Lord opened the ways of all
virtues, and was their true beginning.

<span id="iv.iv.v.vii-p2"></span>46. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.vii-p2.1"></span>Hereby</span> we are brought to understand
that the prophecy of the Incarnation, “The Lord created me the beginning
of His ways for His works,” <span id="fr_2193"></span>[2194](#fn_2193)
means that the Lord Jesus was created of the Virgin for the redeeming of
the Father’s works. Truly, we cannot doubt that this is spoken of the
mystery of the Incarnation, forasmuch as the Lord took upon Him our
flesh, in order to save the works of His hands from the slavery of
corruption, so that He might, by the sufferings of His own body,
overthrow him who had the power of death. For Christ’s flesh is for the
sake of things created, but His Godhead existed before them, seeing that
He is before all things, whilst all things exist together in Him. <span
id="fr_2194"></span>[2195](#fn_2194)

<span id="iv.iv.v.vii-p5"></span>47. His Godhead, then, is not by reason
of creation, but creation exists because of the Godhead; even as the
Apostle showed, saying that all things exist because of the Son of God,
for we read as follows: “But it was fitting that He, through Whom and
because of Whom are all things, after bringing many sons to glory,
should, as Captain of their salvation, be made perfect through
suffering.” <span id="fr_2195"></span>[2196](#fn_2195) Has he not
plainly declared that the Son of God, Who, by reason of His Godhead, was
the Creator of all, did in after time, for the salvation of His people,
submit to the taking on of the flesh and the suffering of death?

<span id="iv.iv.v.vii-p7"></span>48. Now for the sake of what works the
Lord was “created” of a virgin, He Himself, whilst healing the blind
man, has shown, saying: “In Him must I work the works of Him that sent
Me.” <span id="fr_2196"></span>[2197](#fn_2196) Furthermore He said in
the same Scripture, that we might believe Him to speak of the
Incarnation: “As long as I am in this world, I am the Light of this
world,” <span id="fr_2197"></span>[2198](#fn_2197) for, so far as He is
man, He is in this world for a season, but as God He exists at all
times. In another place, too, He says: “Lo, I am with you even unto the
end of the world.” <span id="fr_2198"></span>[2199](#fn_2198)

<span id="iv.iv.v.vii-p11"></span>49. Nor is there any room for
questioning with respect to “the beginning,” seeing that when, during
His earthly life, He was asked, “Who art Thou?” He answered: “The
beginning, even as I tell you.” <span
id="fr_2199"></span>[2200](#fn_2199) This refers not only to the
essential nature of the eternal Godhead, but also to the visible proofs
of virtues, for hereby hath He proved Himself the eternal God, in that
He is the beginning of all things, and the Author of each several
virtue, in that He is the Head of the Church, as it is written: “Because
He is the Head of the Body, of the Church; <span
id="fr_2200"></span>[2201](#fn_2200) Who is the beginning,
first-begotten from the dead.” <span
id="fr_2201"></span>[2202](#fn_2201)

<span id="iv.iv.v.vii-p15"></span>50. It is clear, then, that the words
“be<span id="page_250">p. 250</span> <span
id="iv.iv.v.vii-Page_250"></span>ginning of His ways,” which, as it
seems, we must refer to the mystery of the putting on of His body, are a
prophecy of the Incarnation. For Christ’s purpose in the Incarnation was
to pave for us the road to heaven. Mark how He says: “I go up to My
Father and your Father, to My God and your God.” <span
id="fr_2202"></span>[2203](#fn_2202) Then, to give you to know that the
Almighty Father appointed His ways to the Son, after the
Incarnation, <span id="fr_2203"></span>[2204](#fn_2203) you have in
Zechariah the words of the angel speaking to Joshua clothed in filthy
garments: “Thus saith the Lord Almighty: If thou wilt walk in My ways
and observe My precepts.” <span id="fr_2204"></span>[2205](#fn_2204)
What is the meaning of that filthy garb save the putting on of the
flesh?

<span id="iv.iv.v.vii-p19"></span>51. Now the ways of the Lord are, we
may say, certain courses taken in a good life, guided by Christ, Who
says, “I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life.” <span
id="fr_2205"></span>[2206](#fn_2205) The way, then, is the surpassing
power of God, for Christ, is our way, and a good way, too, is He, a way
which hath opened the kingdom of heaven to believers. <span
id="fr_2206"></span>[2207](#fn_2206) Moreover, the ways of the Lord are
straight, as it is written: “Make Thy ways known unto me, O Lord.” <span
id="fr_2207"></span>[2208](#fn_2207) Chastity is a way, faith is a way,
abstinence is a way. There is, indeed, a way of virtue, and there is a
way of wickedness; for it is written: “And see if there be any way of
wickedness in me.” <span id="fr_2208"></span>[2209](#fn_2208)

<span id="iv.iv.v.vii-p24"></span>52. Christ, then, is the beginning of
our virtue. He is the beginning of purity, Who taught maidens not to
look for the embraces of men, <span id="fr_2209"></span>[2210](#fn_2209)
but to yield the purity of their bodies and minds to the service of the
Holy Spirit rather than to a husband. Christ is the beginning of
frugality, for He became poor, though He was rich. <span
id="fr_2210"></span>[2211](#fn_2210) Christ is the beginning of
patience, for when He was reviled, He reviled not again, when He was
struck, He did not strike back. Christ is the beginning of humility, for
He took the form of a servant, though in the majesty of His power He was
equal with God the Father. <span id="fr_2211"></span>[2212](#fn_2211)
From Him each several virtue has taken its origin.

<span id="iv.iv.v.vii-p28"></span>53. For this cause, then, that we
might learn these divers virtues, “a Son was given us, Whose beginning
was upon His shoulder.” <span id="fr_2212"></span>[2213](#fn_2212) That
“beginning” is the Lord’s Cross—the beginning of strong courage,
wherewith a way has been opened for the holy martyrs to enter the
sufferings of the Holy War.
