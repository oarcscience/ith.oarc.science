#### <span id="iv.vii.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vii-p1"></span>St. Ambrose exhorts parents to train
their children to virginity, and sets before them the troubles arising
from their desire to have grandchildren. He says however that he does
not forbid marriage, but rather defends it against heretics who oppose
it. Still setting virginity before marriage, he speaks of the beauty of
their spouse, and of the gifts wherewith He adorns them, and applies to
these points certain verses of the Song of Songs.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vii-p2"></span>32. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.ii.vii-p2.1"></span>You</span> have heard, O parents, in what
virtues and pursuits you ought to train your daughters, that you may
possess those by whose merits your faults may be redeemed. The virgin is
an offering for her mother, by whose daily sacrifice the divine power is
appeased. A virgin is the inseparable pledge of her parents, who neither
troubles them for a dowry, nor forsakes them, nor injures them in word
or deed. <span id="fr_3190"></span>[3191](#fn_3190)

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vii-p4"></span>33. But some one perhaps wishes to
have grandchildren, and to be called grandfather. In the first place,
such a one gives up what is his own, while seeking what is another’s,
and is already losing what is certain, while hoping to gain what is
uncertain; he gives away his own riches, and still more is asked for; if
he does not pay the dowry, it is exacted; if he lives long, he becomes a
burden. This is to buy a son-in-law, not to gain one who would sell a
sight of their daughter to her parents. Was she borne so long in her
mother’s womb in order that she might pass under the power of another?
And so the parents take the charge of setting off their virgin that she
may so be the sooner removed from them.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vii-p5"></span>34. Some one may say, Do you, then,
discourage marriage? Nay, I encourage it, and condemn those who are wont
to discourage it, so much so, that indeed I am wont to speak of the
marriages of Sarah, Rebecca, and Rachel, and other women of old time, as
instances of singular virtues. For he who condemns marriage, condemns
the birth of children, and condemns the fellowship of the human race,
continued by a series of successive generations. For how could
generation succeed generation in a continual order, unless the gift of
marriage stirred up the desire of offspring? Or how could one set forth
that Isaac went to the altar of God as a victim of his father’s piety,
or that Israel, when yet in the body, saw God, <span
id="fr_3191"></span>[3192](#fn_3191) and gave a holy name to the people
while speaking against that whereby they came into being? Those men,
though wicked, have one point at any rate, wherein they are approved
even by the wise persons, that in <span id="page_369">p. 369</span>
<span id="iv.vii.ii.vii-Page_369"></span>speaking against marriage they
declare that they ought not to have been born.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vii-p7"></span>35. I do not then discourage
marriage, but recapitulate the advantages of holy virginity. This is the
gift of few only, that is of all. And virginity itself cannot exist,
unless it have some mode of coming into existence. I am comparing good
things with good things, that it may be clear which is the more
excellent. Nor do I allege any opinion of my own, but I repeat that
which the Holy Spirit spake by the prophet: “Blessed is the barren that
is undefiled.” <span id="fr_3192"></span>[3193](#fn_3192)

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vii-p9"></span>36. First of all, in that which those
who purpose to marry desire above all things, that they may boast of the
beauty of their husband, they must of necessity confess that they are
inferior to virgins, to Whom alone it is suitable to say: “Thou art
fairer than the children of men, grace is poured on Thy lips.” <span
id="fr_3193"></span>[3194](#fn_3193) Who is that Spouse? One not given
to common indulgences, not proud of possessing riches, but He Whose
throne is for ever and ever. The king’s daughters share in His honour:
“At Thy right hand stood the queen in a vesture of gold, clothed with
variety of virtues. Hearken, then, O daughter, and consider, and incline
thine ear, and forget thine own people and thy father’s house; for the
king hath desired thy beauty, for He is thy God.” <span
id="fr_3194"></span>[3195](#fn_3194)

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vii-p12"></span>37. And observe what a kingdom the
Holy Spirit by the witness of the divine Scriptures has assigned to
thee—gold, and beauty; gold, either because thou art the bride of the
Eternal King, or because having an unconquered mind, thou art not taken
captive by the allurements of pleasures, but rulest over them like a
queen. Gold again, because as that metal is more precious when tried by
fire, so the appearance of the virginal body, consecrated to the Divine
Spirit, gains an increase of its own comeliness, for who can imagine a
loveliness greater than the beauty of her who is loved by the King,
approved by the judge, dedicated to the Lord, consecrated to God; ever a
bride, ever unmarried, so that neither does love suffer an ending, nor
modesty loss.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vii-p13"></span>38. This is indeed true beauty, to
which nothing is wanting, which alone is worthy to hear the Lord saying:
“Thou art all fair, My love, and no blemish is in thee. Come hither from
Lebanon, My spouse, come hither from Lebanon. Thou shalt pass and pass
through from the beginning of faith, from the top of Sanir and Hermon,
from the dens of the lions, from the mountains of the leopards.” <span
id="fr_3195"></span>[3196](#fn_3195) By which references is set forth
the perfect and irreproachable beauty of a virgin soul, consecrated to
the altars of God, not moved by perishable things amidst the haunts and
dens of spiritual wild beasts, but intent, by the mysteries of God, on
being found worthy of the Beloved, Whose breasts are full of joy. For
“wine maketh glad the heart of man.” <span
id="fr_3196"></span>[3197](#fn_3196)

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vii-p16"></span>39. “The smell of thy garments,”
says He, “is above all spices.” <span
id="fr_3197"></span>[3198](#fn_3197) And again: “And the smell of thy
garments is like the smell of Lebanon.” <span
id="fr_3198"></span>[3199](#fn_3198) See what progress thou settest
forth, O Virgin. Thy first odour is above all spices, which were used
upon the burying of the Saviour, <span
id="fr_3199"></span>[3200](#fn_3199) and the fragrance arises from the
mortified motions of the body, and the perishing of the delights of the
members. Thy second odour, like the odour of Lebanon, exhales the
incorruption of the Lord’s body, the flower of virginal chastity.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vii-p3"></span> From this passage it is clear that
in the days of St. Ambrose it was not yet the rule at Milan, though it
was in other places, for the consecrated virgins to live together, but
the older custom still continued.
