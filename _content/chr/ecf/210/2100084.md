#### <span id="iv.i.iii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxi-p1"></span>To defend the weak, or to help
strangers, or to perform similar duties, greatly adds to one’s worth,
especially in the case of tried men. Whilst one gets great blame for
love of money; wastefulness, also, in the case of priests is very much
condemned.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxi-p2"></span>102. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xxi-p2.1"></span>The</span> regard in which one is held is
also very much enhanced when one rescues a poor man out of the hands of
a powerful one, or saves a condemned criminal from death; so long as it
can be done without disturbance, for fear that we might seem to be doing
it rather for the sake of showing off than for pity’s sake, and so might
inflict severer wounds whilst desiring to heal slighter ones. But if one
has freed a man who is crushed down by the resources and faction of a
powerful person, <span id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527) rather than
overwhelmed by the deserts of his own wickedness, then the witness of a
great and high opinion grows strong.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxi-p4"></span>103. Hospitality also serves to
recommend many. <span id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528) For it is a kind
of open display of kindly feelings: so that the stranger may not want
hospitality, but be courteously received, and that the door may be open
to him when he comes. It is most seemly in the eyes of the whole world
that the stranger should be received with honour; that the charm of
hospitality should not fail at our table; that we should meet a guest
with ready and free service, and look out for his arrival.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxi-p6"></span>104. This especially was Abraham’s
praise, <span id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529) for he watched at the
door of his tent, that no stranger by any chance might pass by. He
carefully kept a lookout, so as to meet the stranger, and anticipate
him, and ask him not to pass by, saying: “My lord, if I have found
favour in thy sight, pass not by thy servant.” <span
id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530) Therefore as a reward for his
hospitality, he received the gift of posterity.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxi-p9"></span>105. Lot also, his nephew, <span
id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531) who was near to him not only in
relationship but also in virtue, on account of his readiness to show
hospitality, turned aside the punishment of Sodom from himself and his
family.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxi-p11"></span>106. A man ought therefore to be
hospitable, kind, upright, not desirous of what belongs to another,
willing to give up some <span id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span
id="iv.i.iii.xxi-Page_60"></span>of his own rights if assailed, rather
than to take away another’s. He ought to avoid disputes, to hate
quarrels. He ought to restore unity and the grace of quietness. When a
good man gives up any of his own rights, it is not only a sign of
liberality, but is also accompanied by great advantages. To start with,
it is no small gain to be free from the cost of a lawsuit. Then it also
brings in good results, by an increase of friendship, from which many
advantages rise. These become afterwards most useful to the man that can
despise a little something at the time.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxi-p12"></span>107. In all the duties of hospitality
kindly feeling must be shown to all, but greater respect must be given
to the upright. <span id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532) For “Whosoever
receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, shall receive
a righteous man’s reward,” <span id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533) as
the Lord has said. Such is the favour in which hospitality stands with
God, that not even the draught of cold water shall fail of getting a
reward. <span id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534) Thou seest that Abraham,
in looking for guests, received God Himself to entertain. <span
id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535) Thou seest that Lot received the
angels. <span id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536) And how dost thou know
that when thou receivest men, thou dost not receive Christ? Christ may
be in the stranger that comes, for Christ is there in the person of the
poor, as He Himself says: “I was in prison and thou camest to Me, I was
naked and thou didst clothe Me.” <span id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537)
.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxi-p19"></span>108. It is sweet, then, to seek not
for money but for grace. It is true <span
id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538) that this evil has long ago entered
into human hearts, so that money stands in the place of honour, and the
minds of men are filled with admiration for wealth. Thus love of money
sinks in and as it were dries up every kindly duty; so that men consider
everything a loss which is spent beyond the usual amount. But even here
the holy Scriptures have been on the watch against love of money, that
it might prove no cause of hindrance, saying: “Better is hospitality,
even though it consisteth only of herbs.” <span
id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539) And again: “Better is bread in
pleasantness with peace.” <span id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540) For
the Scriptures teach us not to be wasteful, but liberal.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxi-p23"></span>109. There are two kinds of
free-giving, one arising from liberality, the other from wasteful
extravagance. <span id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541) It is a mark of
liberality to receive the stranger, to clothe the naked, to redeem the
captives, to help the needy. It is wasteful to spend money on expensive
banquets and much wine. Wherefore one reads: “Wine is wasteful,
drunkenness is abusive.” <span id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542) It is
wasteful to spend one’s own wealth merely for the sake of gaining the
favour of the people. This they do who spend their inheritance on the
games of the circus, or on theatrical pieces and gladiatorial shows, or
even a combat of wild beasts, just to surpass the fame of their
forefathers for these things. All this that they do is but foolish, for
it is not right to be extravagant in spending money even on good works.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxi-p26"></span>110. It is a right kind of liberality
to keep due measure towards the poor themselves, that one may have
enough for more; and not to go beyond the right limit for the sake of
winning favour. Whatever comes forth out of a pure sincere disposition,
that is seemly. It is also seemly not to enter on unnecessary
undertakings, nor to omit those that are needed.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxi-p27"></span>111. But it befits the priest
especially to adorn the temple of God with fitting splendour, so that
the court of the Lord may be made glorious by his endeavours. He ought
always to spend money as mercy demands. It behoves him to give to
strangers what is right. This must not be too much, but enough; not more
than, but as much as, kindly feeling demands, so that he may never seek
another’s favour at the expense of the poor, nor show himself as either
too stingy or too free to the clergy. The one act is unkind, the other
wasteful. It is unkind if money should be wanting for the necessities of
those whom one ought to win back from their wretched employments. It is
wasteful if there should be too much over for pleasure.

[Next: Chapter XXII. We must observe a right standard between too great
mildness and excessive harshness. They who endeavour to creep into the
hearts of others by a false show of mildness gain nothing substantial or
lasting. This the example of Absalom plainly enough shows.](2100085)
