<span id="iv.i.iv.i"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.iv.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.i.iv.i-p1"></span>We are taught by David and Solomon how to
take counsel with our own heart. Scipio is not to be accounted prime
author of the saying which is ascribed to him. The writer proves what
glorious things the holy prophets accomplished in their time of quiet,
and shows, by examples of their and others’ leisure moments, that a just
man is never alone in trouble.

<span id="iv.i.iv.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.i-p2.1"></span>The</span> prophet David taught us that we
should go about in our heart as though in a large house; that we should
hold converse with it as with some trusty companion. He spoke to
himself, and conversed with himself, as these words show: “I said, I
will take heed to my ways.” <span id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575)
Solomon his son also said: “Drink water out of thine own vessels, and
out of the springs of thy wells; ” <span
id="fr_576"></span>[577](#fn_576) that is: use thine own counsel. For:
“Counsel in the heart of a man is as deep waters.” <span
id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577) “Let no stranger,” it says, “share it
with thee. Let the fountain of thy water be thine own, and rejoice with
thy wife who is thine from thy youth. Let the loving hind and pleasant
doe converse with thee.” <span id="fr_578"></span>[579](#fn_578)

<span id="iv.i.iv.i-p7"></span>2. Scipio, <span
id="fr_579"></span>[580](#fn_579) therefore, was not the first to know
that he was not alone when he was alone, or that he was least at leisure
when he was at leisure. For Moses knew it before him, who, when silent,
was crying out; <span id="fr_580"></span>[581](#fn_580) who, when he
stood at ease, was fighting, nay, not merely fighting but triumphing
over enemies whom he had not come near. So much was he at ease, that
others held up his hands; yet he was no less active than others, for he
with his hands at ease was overcoming the enemy, whom they that were in
the battle could not conquer. <span id="fr_581"></span>[582](#fn_581)
Thus Moses in his silence spoke, and in his ease laboured hard. And were
his labours greater than his times of quiet, who, being in the mount for
forty days, received the whole law? <span
id="fr_582"></span>[583](#fn_582) And in that solitude there was One not
far away to speak with him. Whence also David says: “I will hear what
the Lord God will say within me.” <span
id="fr_583"></span>[584](#fn_583) How much greater a thing is it for God
to speak with any one, than for a man to speak with himself!

<span id="iv.i.iv.i-p13"></span>3. The apostles passed by and their
shadows cured the sick. <span id="fr_584"></span>[585](#fn_584) Their
garments were touched and health was granted.

<span id="iv.i.iv.i-p15"></span><span id="page_68">p. 68</span> <span
id="iv.i.iv.i-Page_68"></span>4. Elijah spoke the word, and the rain
ceased and fell not on the earth for three years and six months. <span
id="fr_585"></span>[586](#fn_585) Again he spoke, and the barrel of meal
failed not, and the cruse of oil wasted not the whole time of that long
famine. <span id="fr_586"></span>[587](#fn_586)

<span id="iv.i.iv.i-p18"></span>5. But—as many delight in warfare—which
is the most glorious, to bring a battle to an end by the strength of a
great army, or, by merits before God alone? Elisha rested in one place
while the king of Syria waged a great war against the people of our
fathers, and was adding to its terrors by various treacherous plans, and
was endeavouring to catch them in an ambush. But the prophet found out
all their preparations, and being by the grace of God present everywhere
in mental vigour, he told the thoughts of their enemies to his
countrymen, and warned them of what places to beware. And when this was
known to the king of Syria, he sent an army and shut in the prophet.
Elisha prayed and caused all of them to be struck with blindness, and
made those who had come to besiege him enter Samaria as captives. <span
id="fr_587"></span>[588](#fn_587)

<span id="iv.i.iv.i-p20"></span>6. Let us compare this leisure of his
with that of others. <span id="fr_588"></span>[589](#fn_588) Other men
for the sake of rest are wont to withdraw their minds from business, and
to retire from the company and companionship of men; to seek the
retirement of the country or the solitude of the fields, or in the city
to give their minds a rest and to enjoy peace and quietness. But Elisha
was ever active. In solitude he divided Jordan on passing over it, so
that the lower part flowed down, whilst the upper returned to its
source. On Carmel he promises the woman, who so far had had no child,
that a son now unhoped for should be born to her. <span
id="fr_589"></span>[590](#fn_589) He raises the dead to life, <span
id="fr_590"></span>[591](#fn_590) he corrects the bitterness of the
food, and makes it to be sweet by mixing meal with it. <span
id="fr_591"></span>[592](#fn_591) Having distributed ten loaves to the
people for food, he gathered up the fragments that were left after they
had been filled. <span id="fr_592"></span>[593](#fn_592) He makes the
iron head of the axe, which had fallen off and was sunk deep in the
river Jordan, to swim by putting the wooden handle in the water. <span
id="fr_593"></span>[594](#fn_593) He changes leprosy for
cleanness, <span id="fr_594"></span>[595](#fn_594) drought for
rain, <span id="fr_595"></span>[596](#fn_595) famine for plenty. <span
id="fr_596"></span>[597](#fn_596)

<span id="iv.i.iv.i-p30"></span>7. When can the upright man be alone,
since he is always with God? When is he left forsaken who is never
separated from Christ? “Who,” it says, “shall separate us from the love
of Christ? I am confident that neither death nor life nor angel shall do
so.” <span id="fr_597"></span>[598](#fn_597) And when can he be deprived
of his labour who never can be deprived of his merits, wherein his
labour receives its crown? By what places is he limited to whom the
whole world of riches is a possession? By what judgment is he confined
who is never blamed by any one? For he is “as unknown yet well known, as
dying and behold he lives, as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor
yet making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all
things.” <span id="fr_598"></span>[599](#fn_598) For the upright man
regards nothing but what is consistent and virtuous. And so although he
seems poor to another, he is rich to himself, for his worth is taken not
at the value of the things which are temporal, but of the things which
are eternal.

<span class="sc"><span id="iv.i.iv.i-p8.1"></span>b.c.</span> 234. He
was the greatest Roman of his time, a famous general and the conqueror
of Hannibal. His exploits in Africa won him the surname of Africanus.
Owing to jealous intrigues he in <span class="sc"><span

estate, where he passed the rest of his days in peaceful employments.
Cicero (*de Off.* III. 1) relates on Cato’s authority that he used to
say: “*Nunquam se minus otiosum esse quam cum otiosus, nec minsolum quam
cum solus esset.*”

[Next: Chapter II. The discussions among philosophers about the
comparison between what is virtuous and what is useful have nothing to
do with Christians. For with them nothing is useful which is not just.
What are the duties of perfection, and what are ordinary duties? The
same words often suit different things in different ways. Lastly, a just
man never seeks his own advantage at the cost of another's disadvantage,
but rather is always on the lookout for what is useful to
others.](2100096)
