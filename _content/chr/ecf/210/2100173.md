#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xxi-p1"></span>Isaiah was sent by the Spirit, and
accordingly the same Spirit was seen by him. What is meant by the
revolving wheels, and the divers wings, and how since the Spirit is
proclaimed Lord of Sabaoth by the Seraphim, certainly none but impious
men can deny Him this title.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xxi-p2"></span>159. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.xxi-p2.1"></span>Since,</span> then, He has a share in the
kingdom, what hinders us from understanding that it was the Holy Spirit
by Whom Isaiah was sent? For on the authority of Paul we cannot doubt,
whose judgment the Evangelist Luke so much approved in the Acts of the
Apostles as to write as follows in Paul’s words: “Well spake the Holy
Spirit through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers, saying: Go to this
people and say, Ye shall hear with the ear and shall not understand, and
seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive.” <span
id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xxi-p4"></span>160. It is, then, the Spirit Who sent
Isaiah. If the Spirit sent him, it is certainly the Spirit Whom, after
Uzziah’s death, Isaiah saw, when he said: “I saw the Lord of Sabaoth
sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and the house was full of His
majesty. And the Seraphim stood round about Him, each one had six wings,
and with two they were covering His face, and with two they were
covering His feet, and with two they were flying; and they cried out one
to the other, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Sabaoth, the
whole earth is full of His majesty.” <span
id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xxi-p6"></span>161. If the Seraphim were standing,
how were they flying? If they were flying, how were they standing? If we
cannot understand this, how is it that we want to understand God, Whom
we have not seen?

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xxi-p7"></span>162. But as the prophet saw a wheel
running within a wheel <span id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440) (which
certainly does not refer to any appearance to the bodily sight, but to
the grace of each Testament; for the life of the saints is polished, and
so consistent with itself that later portions agree with the former).
The wheel, then, within a wheel is life under the Law, life under grace;
inasmuch as Jews are within the Church, the Law is included in grace.
For he is within the Church who is a Jew secretly; and circumcision of
the heart is a sacrament within the Church. But that Jewry is within the
Church of which it is written: “In Jewry is God known;” <span
id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441) therefore as wheel runs within
wheel, so in like manner the wings were still, and the wings were
flying.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xxi-p10"></span>163. In like manner, too, the
Seraphim were veiling His face with two wings, and with two were veiling
His feet, and with two were flying. For here also is a mystery of
spiritual wisdom. Seasons stand, seasons fly; the past stand, the future
are flying, and like the wings of the Seraphim, so they veil the face or
the feet of God; inasmuch as in God, Who has neither beginning nor end,
the whole course of times and seasons, from this knowledge of its
beginning and its end, is at rest. So, then, times past and future
stand, the present fly. Ask not after the secrets of His beginning or
His end, for there is neither. You have the present, but you must praise
Him, not question.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xxi-p11"></span>164. The Seraphim with unwearied
voices praise, and do you question? And certainly when they do this they
show us that we must not sometimes question about God, <span
id="page_158">p. 158</span> <span id="iv.ii.iv.xxi-Page_158"></span>but
always praise Him. Therefore the Holy Spirit is also the Lord of
Sabaoth. Unless perchance the Teacher Whom Christ chose pleases not the
impious, or they can deny that the Holy Spirit is the Lord of powers,
Who gives whatever powers He Himself wills.

[Next: Chapter XXII. In proof of the Unity in Trinity the passage of
Isaiah which has been cited is considered, and it is shown that there is
no difference as to its sense amongst those who expound it of the
Father, or of the Son, or of the Spirit. If He Who was crucified was
Lord of glory, so, too, is the Holy Spirit equal in all things to the
Father and the Son, and the Arians will never be able to diminish His
glory.](2100174)
