<p> <a name="iv.v.vii"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="iv.v.vii-p0.1"></A>Chapter VI.</h3>  
<p class="c32"><a name="iv.v.vii-p1"></A>Why they who come forth from the laver of baptism are anointed on the head; why, too, after baptism, their feet are washed, and what sins are remitted in each case.</p>  
<p class="c22"><a name="iv.v.vii-p2"></A>29. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.vii-p2.1"></A>After</span> this, you went up to the priest, consider what followed. Was it not that of which David speaks: &#8220;Like the ointment upon the head, which went down to the beard, even Aaron&#146;s beard&#8221;?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2862"></A><A HREF="#fn_2862"><FONT SIZE="1">2863</FONT></A>
 This is the ointment of which Solomon, too, says: &#8220;Thy Name is ointment poured out, therefore have the maidens loved Thee and drawn Thee.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2863"></A><A HREF="#fn_2863"><FONT SIZE="1">2864</FONT></A>
 How many souls regenerated this day have loved Thee, Lord Jesus, and have said: &#8220;Draw us after Thee, we are running after the odour of Thy garments,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2864"></A><A HREF="#fn_2864"><FONT SIZE="1">2865</FONT></A>
 that they might drink in the odour of Thy resurrection.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.v.vii-p6"></A>30. Consider now why this is done, for &#8220;the eyes of a wise man are in his head;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2865"></A><A HREF="#fn_2865"><FONT SIZE="1">2866</FONT></A>
 therefore the ointment flows down to the beard, that is to say, to the beauty of youth; and therefore, Aaron&#146;s beard, that we, too, may become a chosen race, priestly and precious, for we are all anointed with spiritual grace for a share in the kingdom of God and in the priesthood.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.v.vii-p8"></A>31. You went up from the font; remember the Gospel lesson. For our Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospel washed the feet of His disciples. When He came to Simon Peter, Peter said: &#8220;Thou shalt never wash my feet.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2866"></A><A HREF="#fn_2866"><FONT SIZE="1">2867</FONT></A>
 He did not perceive the mystery, and therefore he refused the service, for he thought that the humility of the servant would be injured, if he patiently allowed the Lord to minister to him. And the Lord answered him: &#8220;If I wash not thy feet, thou wilt have no part with Me.&#8221; Peter, hearing this, replies: &#8220;Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.&#8221; The Lord answered: &#8220;He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every whit.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2867"></A><A HREF="#fn_2867"><FONT SIZE="1">2868</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.v.vii-p11"></A>32. Peter was clean, but he must wash his feet, for he had sin by succession from the first man, when the serpent overthrew him and persuaded him to sin. His feet were therefore washed, that hereditary sins might be done away, for our own sins are remitted through baptism.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.v.vii-p12"></A>33. Observe at the same time that the mystery consists in the very office of humility, for Christ says: &#8220;If I, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; how much more ought you to wash one another&#146;s feet.&#8221; For, since the Author of Salvation Himself redeemed us through His obedience, how much more ought we His servants to offer the service of our humility and obedience.</p>

<A HREF="2100282">Next: Chapter VII. The washing away of sins is indicated by the white robes of the catechumens, whence the Church speaks of herself as black and comely. Angels marvel at her brightness as at that of the flesh of the Lord. Moreover, Christ Himself commended His beauty to His Spouse under many figures. The mutual affection of the one for the other is described.</A></CENTER>
