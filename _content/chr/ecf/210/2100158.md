<span id="iv.ii.iv.vi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.vi-p1"></span>The Spirit rebukes just as do the
Father and the Son; and indeed judges could not judge without Him, as is
shown by the judgments of Solomon and Daniel, which are explained in a
few words, by the way; and no other than the Holy Spirit inspired
Daniel.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.vi-p2"></span>35. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.vi-p2.1"></span>Why</span> do we reject like words when we
assert the oneness of power, since the oneness of power extends so far
that the Spirit rebukes, as the Father rebukes, and as the Son rebukes.
For so it is written: “O Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, neither
chasten me in Thy displeasure.” <span
id="fr_1273"></span>[1274](#fn_1273) Then in the forty-ninth
\[fiftieth\] Psalm, the Lord speaks thus: “I will rebuke thee, and will
set thy sins before thy face.” <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[1275](#fn_1274) And in like manner the Son said of
the Holy Spirit: “When I go away, I will send the Paraclete to you. And
He, when He is come, will rebuke the world, concerning sin, and
concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment.” <span
id="fr_1275"></span>[1276](#fn_1275)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.vi-p6"></span>36. But whither is the madness of
faithless men leading us, so that we appear to be proving, as if it were
a matter of doubt, that the Holy Spirit rebukes, whereas judges
themselves are unable to judge, except through the Spirit. Lastly, that
famous judgment of Solomon, when, amongst the difficulties arising from
those who were contending, as one, having overlain the child which she
had borne, wished to claim the child of another, and the other was
protecting her own son, he both discovered deceit in the very hidden
thoughts, and affection in the mother’s heart, was certainly so
admirable only by the gift of the Holy Spirit. For no other sword would
have penetrated the hidden feeling of those women, except the sword of
the Spirit, of which the Lord says: “I am not come to send peace but a
sword.” <span id="fr_1276"></span>[1277](#fn_1276) For the inmost mind
cannot be penetrated by steel, but by the Spirit: “For the Spirit of
understanding is holy, one only, manifold, subtle, lively,” and, farther
on, “overseeing all things.” <span id="fr_1277"></span>[1278](#fn_1277)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.vi-p9"></span>37. Consider what the prophet says,
that He oversees all things. And so Solomon also oversaw, so that he
ordered that sword to be brought, because while pretending that he
intended to divide the infant, he reflected that the true mother would
have more regard for her son than for her comfort, and would set
kindness before right, not right before kindness. But that she who
feigned the feelings of a mother, blinded by the desire of gaining her
end, would think little of the destruction of him in regard to whom she
felt no outgoing of tenderness. And so that spiritual man, that he might
judge all things (for he that is spiritual judgeth all things), <span
id="fr_1278"></span>[1279](#fn_1278) sought in the feelings the natural
disposition which was concealed in the language, and questioned
tenderness that he might set forth the truth. So the mother overcame by
the affection of love, which is a fruit of the Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.vi-p11"></span>38. He judges in a prophet, for the
word of wisdom is given by the Spirit; <span
id="fr_1279"></span>[1280](#fn_1279) how, then, do men deny that the
Spirit can rebuke the world concerning judgment, Who removes doubt from
judgment, and grants the successful issue?

<span id="iv.ii.iv.vi-p13"></span>39. Daniel also, unless he had
received the Spirit of God, would never have been able to discover that
lustful adultery, that fraudulent lie. For when Susanna, assailed by the
conspiracy of the elders, saw that the mind of the people was moved by
consideration for the old men, and destitute of all help, alone amongst
men, conscious of her chastity she prayed God to judge; it is written:
“The Lord heard her voice, when she was being led to be put to death,
and the Lord raised up the Holy Spirit of a young youth, whose name was
Daniel.” <span id="fr_1280"></span>[1281](#fn_1280) And so according to
the grace of the Holy Spirit received by him, he discovered the varying
evidence of the treacherous, for it was none other than the operation of
divine power, that his voice should make them whose inward feelings were
concealed to be known.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.vi-p15"></span>41. Understand, then, the sacred and
heavenly miracle of the Holy Spirit. She who preferred to be chaste in
herself, rather than in the opinion of the people, she who preferred to
hazard \[the reputation of\] her innocence, rather than her modesty, who
<span id="page_141">p. 141</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iv.vi-Page_141"></span>when she was accused was silent, when
she was condemned held her peace, content with the judgment of her own
conscience, who preserved regard for her modesty even in peril, that
they who were not able to force her chastity might not seem to have
forced her to petulance; when she called upon the Lord, she obtained the
Spirit, Who made known the hidden consciousness of the elders.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.vi-p16"></span>42. Let the chaste learn not to dread
calumny. For she who preferred chastity to life did not suffer the loss
of life, and retained the glory of chastity. So, too, Abraham, once
bidden to go to foreign lands, and not being held back either by the
danger to his wife’s modesty, nor by the fear of death before him,
preserved both his own life and his wife’s chastity. <span
id="fr_1281"></span>[1282](#fn_1281) So no one has ever repented of
trusting God, and chastity increased devotion in Sarah, and devotion
chastity.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.vi-p18"></span>43. And lest any one should perhaps
think that, as the Scripture says, “God raised up the Holy Spirit of a
young youth,” the Spirit in him was that of a man, not the Holy Spirit,
let him read farther on, and he will find that Daniel received the Holy
Spirit, and therefore prophesied. Lastly, too, the king advanced him
because he had the grace of the Spirit. For he speaks thus: “Thou, O
Daniel, art able, forasmuch as the Holy Spirit of God is in thee.” <span
id="fr_1282"></span>[1283](#fn_1282) And farther on it is written: “And
Daniel was set over them, because an excellent Spirit was in him.” <span
id="fr_1283"></span>[1284](#fn_1283) And the Spirit of Moses also was
distributed to those who were to be judges. <span
id="fr_1284"></span>[1285](#fn_1284)

[Next: Chapter VII. The Son Himself does not judge or punish without the
Spirit, so that the same Spirit is called the Sword of the Word. But
inasmuch as the Word is in turn called the Sword of the Spirit, the
highest unity of power is thereby recognized in each.](2100159)
