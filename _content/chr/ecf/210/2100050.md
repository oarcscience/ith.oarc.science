#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xxxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxviii-p1"></span>We must strengthen the mind against
troubles to come, and build it up by looking out for them beforehand.
What difficulties there are in doing this.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxviii-p2"></span>188. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxxviii-p2.1"></span>But</span> again, no one must retire
through cowardice, or give up his faith from fear of danger. With what
grace must the soul be equipped, and the mind trained and taught to
stand firm, so as never to be disturbed by any fears, to be broken by
any troubles, or to yield to any torments! With what difficulty indeed
are they borne! But as all pains seem less in the fear of greater pains,
so also, if thou dost build up thy soul by quiet counsel, and dost
determine not to go from thy course, and layest before thee the fear of
divine judgment and the torment of eternal punishment, canst thou gain
endurance of mind.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxviii-p3"></span>189. If a man thus prepares
himself, he gives signs of great diligence. On the other hand it is a
sign of natural ability, if a man by the power of his mind can foresee
the future, and put as it were before his eyes what may happen, and
decide what he ought to do if it should take place. It may happen, too,
that he will think over two or three things at once, which he supposes
may come either singly or together, and that he settles what he will do
with them as he thinks will be to the most advantage, in the event of
their coming either singly or together.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxviii-p4"></span>200. Therefore it is the duty of a
brave man not to shut his eyes when anything threatens, but to put it
before him and to search it out as it were in the mirror of his mind,
and to meet the future with foreseeing thought, for fear he might
afterwards have to say: This has come to me because I thought it could
not come about. If misfortunes are not looked for beforehand, they
quickly get a hold over us. In war an unexpected enemy is with
difficulty resisted, and if he finds the others unprepared, he easily
overcomes them; so evils unthought of readily break down the soul.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxviii-p5"></span>200. In these two points, then,
consists the excellency of the soul: so that thy soul, trained in good
thoughts, and with a pure heart, first, may see what is true and
virtuous (for “blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see
God”), <span id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290) and may decide that only
to be good which is virtuous; and, next, may never be disturbed by
business of any kind, nor get tossed about by any desires.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxviii-p7"></span>201. Not that this is an easy thing
for any one. For what is so difficult as to discern, as though from some
watch-tower, the resources of wisdom and all those other things, which
to most seem so great and noble? Again, what so difficult as to place
one’s decision on fixed grounds, and to despise what one has decided to
be worthless, as of no good? Or, once more, what so difficult, when some
misfortune has happened, and it is looked on as something serious and
grieving, as to bear it in such a way that one considers it nothing
beyond what is natural, when one reads: “Naked was I born, naked shall I
go forth. What the Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away” <span
id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291) (he who said this had lost children
and possessions), and to preserve in all things the character of a wise
and upright man, as he did who says: “As the Lord pleased, so did He.
Blessed be the name of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292) And again: “Thou speakest as one of
the foolish women speaketh. Shall we receive good at the hand of God,
and shall we not receive evil?” <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293)
