<span id="iv.i.ii.i"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.i.ii.i-p1"></span>A Bishop’s special office is to teach;
St. Ambrose himself, however, has to learn in order that he may teach;
or rather has to teach what he has not learnt; at any rate learning and
teaching with himself must go on together.

<span id="iv.i.ii.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.i-p2.1"></span>I think</span> I shall not seem to be taking
too much on myself, if, in the midst of my children, I yield to my
desire to teach, seeing that the master of humility himself has said:
“Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the
Lord.” <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27) Wherein one may observe both
the humility and the grace of his reverence for God. For in saying “the
fear of the Lord,” which seems to be common to all, he has described the
chief mark of reverence for God. As, however, fear itself is the
beginning of wisdom and the source of blessedness—for they that fear the
Lord are blessed <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28) —he has plainly
marked himself out as the teacher for instruction in wisdom, and the
guide to the attainment of blessedness.

<span id="iv.i.ii.i-p5"></span>2. We therefore, being anxious to imitate
his reverence for God, and not without justification in dispensing
grace, deliver to you as to children those things which the Spirit of
Wisdom has imparted to him, and which have been made clear to us through
him, and learnt by sight and by example. For we can no longer now escape
from the duty of teaching which the needs of the priesthood have laid
upon us, though we tried to avoid it: <span
id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29) “For God gave some, apostles; and some,
prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers.” <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30)

<span id="iv.i.ii.i-p8"></span>3. I do not therefore claim for myself
the glory of the apostles (for who can do this save those whom the Son
of God Himself has chosen?); nor the grace of the prophets, nor the
virtue of the evangelists, nor the cautious care of the pastors. I only
desire to attain to that care and diligence in the sacred writings,
which the Apostle has placed last amongst the duties of the
saints; <span id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31) and this very thing I
desire, so that, in the endeavour to teach, I may be able to learn. For
one is the true Master, Who alone has not learnt, what He taught all;
but men learn before they teach, and receive from Him what they may hand
on to others.

<span id="iv.i.ii.i-p10"></span>4. But not even this was the case with
me. For I was carried off from the judgment seat, and the garb
\[*infulis*\] of office, to enter on the priesthood, <span
id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32) and began to teach you, what I myself had
not yet learnt. So it happened that I began to teach before I began to
learn. Therefore I must learn and teach at the same time, since I had no
leisure to learn before. <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33)

<span id="iv.i.ii.i-p6"></span> Paulinus, in his *Life of St. Ambrose,*
relates various expedients that he tried, to enable him to avoid the
office to which he had been called; e.g. how he caused torture to be
applied to prisoners, contrary to his usual practice, in the hope that
this might lead to his rejection. More than once, also, he endeavoured
to escape the honour by flight.

<span id="iv.i.ii.i-p11"></span> St. Ambrose, at the time of his
election to the episcopate, was a consular magistrate, and was not even
baptized. The *infula* was a flock of red and white wool formed into a
fillet, and worn on the head; from which ribands hung down on either
side. It was a mark of religious consecration, and so worn by the
priests and vestal virgins. In later times it was adopted also by the
emperors and magistrates as a sign of their semi-sacred character.
