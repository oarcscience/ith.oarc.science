<span id="iv.i.ii.xlviii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xlviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLVIII.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlviii-p1"></span>The argument for restraining anger
is given again. Then the three classes of those who receive wrongs are
set forth; to the most perfect of which the Apostle and David are said
to have attained. He takes the opportunity to state the difference
between this and the future life.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlviii-p2"></span>242. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xlviii-p2.1"></span>We</span> wish if we can to point out
three classes of men who receive wrongs in holy Scripture. One of these
forms the class of those whom the sinner reviles, abuses, rides over
rough-shod. <span id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331) And just because
justice fails them, shame grows, pain increases. Very many of my own
order, of my own number, are like these. For if any one does me, who am
weak, an injury, perhaps, though I am weak, I may forgive the wrong done
me. If he charges me with an offence I am not such an one as to be
content with the witness of my own conscience, although I know I am
clear of what he brings against me; but I desire, just because I am
weak, to wash out the mark of my inborn shame. Therefore I demand eye
for eye, and tooth for tooth, and repay abuse with abuse.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlviii-p4"></span>243. If, however, I am one who is
advancing, although not yet perfect, I do not return the reproaches; and
if he breaks out into abuse, and fills my ears with reproaches, I am
silent and do not answer.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlviii-p5"></span>244. But if I am perfect (I say this
only by way of example, for in truth I am weak), if, then, I am perfect,
I bless him that curses me, as Paul also blessed, for he says: “Being
reviled we bless.” <span id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332) He had heard
Him Who says: “Love your enemies, pray for them which despitefully use
you and persecute you.” <span id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333) And so
Paul suffered persecution and endured it, for he conquered and calmed
his human feelings for the sake of the reward set before him, namely,
that he should become a son of God if he loved his enemies.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlviii-p8"></span>245. We call show, too, that holy
David was like to Paul in this same class of virtue. When the son of
Shimei cursed him, and charged him with heavy offences, at the first he
was silent and humbled himself, and was silent even about his good
deeds, that is, his knowledge of good works. Then he even asked to be
cursed; for when he was cursed he hoped to gain divine pity. <span
id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlviii-p10"></span>246. But see how he stored up
humility and justice and prudence so as to merit grace from the Lord! At
first he said: “Therefore he cursed me, because the Lord hath said unto
him that he should curse.” <span id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335) Here
we have humility; for he thought that those things which are divinely
ordered were to be endured with an even mind, as though he were but some
servant lad. Then he said: “Behold my son, which came forth of my
bowels, seeketh my life.” <span id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336) Here
we have justice. For if we suffer hard things at the hand of our own
family, why are we angry at what is done to us by strangers? Lastly he
says: “Let him alone that he may curse, for the Lord hath bidden him. It
may be that the Lord will look on my humiliation and requite me good for
this cursing.” <span id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337) So he bore not
only the abuse, but left the man unpunished when throwing stones and
following him. Nay, more, after his victory he freely granted him pardon
when he asked for it.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlviii-p14"></span>247. I have written this to show
that holy David, in true evangelical spirit, was not only not offended,
but was even thankful to his abuser, and was delighted rather than
angered by his wrongs, for which he thought some return would be granted
to him. But, though perfect, he sought something still more perfect. As
a man he grew hot at the pain of his wrongs, but like a good soldier he
conquered, he endured like a brave wrestler. The end and aim of his
patience was the expectation of the fulfilment of the promises, and
therefore he said: “Lord, make me to know mine end and the measure of my
days, what it is: that I may know what is wanting to me.” <span
id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338) He seeks, then, that end of the
heavenly promises, when each one shall arise in his own order: “Christ
the firstfruits, then they that are Christ’s who have believed in His
coming. Then cometh the end.” <span id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339)
For when the kingdom is delivered up to God, even the Father, and all
the powers are put down, as the Apostle says, then perfection begins.
Here, then, is the hindrance, here the weakness of the perfect; there
full perfection. Thus it is he asks for those days of eternal life which
are, and not for those which pass away, so that he may know what is
wanting to <span id="page_40">p. 40</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.xlviii-Page_40"></span>him, what is the land of promise that
bears everlasting fruits, which is the first mansion in his Father’s
house, which the second, which the third, wherein each one will rest
according to his merits.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlviii-p17"></span>248. We then must strive for that
wherein is perfection and wherein is truth. Here is the shadow, here the
image; <span id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340) there the truth. The
shadow is in the law, the image in the Gospel, the truth in heaven. In
old times a lamb, a Calf was offered; now Christ is offered. But He is
offered as man and as enduring suffering. And He offers Himself as a
priest to take away our sins, here in an image, there in truth, <span
id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341) where with the Father He intercedes
for us as our Advocate. Here, then, we walk in an image, we see in an
image; there face to face where is full perfection. For all perfection
rests in the truth.

[Next: Chapter XLIX. We must reserve the likeness of the virtues in
ourselves. The likeness of the devil and of vice must be got rid of, and
especially that of avarice; for this deprives us of liberty, and
despoils those who are in the midst of vanities of the image of
God.](2100061)
