### <span id="iv.viii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.viii.iv-p1"></span>St. Ambrose returns to the story of the
widow of Sarepta, and shows that she represented the Church, hence that
she was an example to virgins, married women, and widows. Then he refers
to the prophet as setting forth Christ, inasmuch as he foretold the
mysteries and the rain which was to come. Next he touches upon and
explains the twofold sign of Gideon, and points out that it is not in
every one’s power to work miracles, and that the Incarnation of Christ
and the rejection of the Jews were foreshadowed in that account.

<span id="iv.viii.iv-p2"></span>14. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.viii.iv-p2.1"></span>To</span> return to what was treated of
above, <span id="fr_3320"></span>[3321](#fn_3320) what is the meaning of
the fact that when there was a very great famine in all the land, yet
the care of God was not wanting to the widow, and the prophet was sent
to sustain her? And when in this story the Lord warns me that He is
about to speak in truth, <span id="fr_3321"></span>[3322](#fn_3321) He
seems to bid my ears attend to a mystery. For what can be more true than
the mystery of Christ and the Church? Not, then, without a purpose is
one preferred amongst many widows. Who is such an one, to whom so great
a prophet who was carried up into heaven, should be guided, especially
at that time when the heaven was shut for three years and six months,
when there was a great famine in the whole land? The famine was
everywhere, and yet notwithstanding this widow did not want. What are
these three years? Are they not, perchance, those in which the Lord came
to the earth and could not find fruit on the fig-tree, according to that
which is written: “Behold, there are three years that I came seeking
fruit on this fig-tree, and find none.” <span
id="fr_3322"></span>[3323](#fn_3322)

<span id="iv.viii.iv-p6"></span>15. This is assuredly that widow of whom
it was said: “Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not, break forth and
cry, thou that availest not with child; for many are the children of the
desolate, more than of her who hath an husband.” <span
id="fr_3323"></span>[3324](#fn_3323) And well is she a widow of whom it
is well said: “Thou <span id="page_394">p. 394</span> <span
id="iv.viii.iv-Page_394"></span>shalt not remember thy shame and thy
widowhood, for I am the Lord Who make thee.” <span
id="fr_3324"></span>[3325](#fn_3324) And perchance therefore is she a
widow who has lost her Husband indeed in the suffering of His body, but
in the day of judgment shall receive again the Son of Man Whom she
seemed to have lost. “For a short time have I forsaken thee,” <span
id="fr_3325"></span>[3326](#fn_3325) He says, in order that, being
forsaken, she may the more gloriously keep her faith.

<span id="iv.viii.iv-p10"></span>16. All, then, have an example to
imitate, virgins, married women, and widows. And perchance is the Church
therefore a virgin, married, and a widow, because they are one body in
Christ. She is then that widow for Whose sake when there was a dearth of
the heavenly Word on earth, the prophets were appointed, for there was a
widow who was barren, yet reserved her bringing forth for its own time.

<span id="iv.viii.iv-p11"></span>17. So that his person does not seem to
us of small account, who by his word moistened the dry earth with the
dew of heaven, and unlocked the closed heavens certainly not by human
power. For who is he who can open the heavens except Christ, for Whom
daily out of sinners’ food is gathered, an increase for the Church? For
it is not in the power of man to say: “The barrel of meal shall not
waste, and the cruse of oil shall not fail, until the day on which the
Lord shall send rain on the earth.” <span
id="fr_3326"></span>[3327](#fn_3326) For though it be the rule of the
prophets to speak thus, the voice is in truth that of the Lord. And so
it is stated first: “For thus saith the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3327"></span>[3328](#fn_3327) For it is of the Lord to vouch for
a continuance of heavenly sacraments, and to promise that the grace of
spiritual joy shall not fail, to grant the defences of life, the seals
of faith, the gifts of virtues.

<span id="iv.viii.iv-p14"></span>18. But what does this mean: “Until the
day on which the Lord shall send rain on the earth”? except that He,
too, “shall come down like rain upon a fleece, and like the drops that
water the earth.” <span id="fr_3328"></span>[3329](#fn_3328) In which
passage is disclosed the mystery of the old history where Gideon, the
warrior of the mystic conflict, receiving the pledge of future victory,
recognized the spiritual sacrament in the vision of his mind, that that
rain was the dew of the Divine Word, which first came down on the
fleece, when all the earth was parched with continual drought, and by a
second true sign, moistened the floor of all the earth with a shower,
whilst dryness was upon the fleece. <span
id="fr_3329"></span>[3330](#fn_3329)

<span id="iv.viii.iv-p17"></span>19. For the prescient man observed the
sign of the future growth of the Church. For first in Judæa the dew of
the divine utterance began to give moisture (for “in Jewry is God
known”), <span id="fr_3330"></span>[3331](#fn_3330) whilst the whole
earth remained without the dew of faith. But when Joseph’s flock began
to deny God, and by venturing on various enormous offences to incur
guilt before God, then when the dew of the heavenly shower was poured on
the whole earth, the people of the Jews began to grow dry and parched in
their own unbelief, when the clouds of prophecy and the healthful shower
of the Apostles watered the holy Church gathered together from all parts
of the world. This is that rain, now condensed from earthly moisture,
now from mountain mists, but diffused throughout the whole world in the
salutary shower of the heavenly Scriptures.

<span id="iv.viii.iv-p19"></span>20. By this example, then, it is shown
that not all can merit the miracles of divine power, but they who are
aided by the pursuits of religious devotion, and that they lose the
fruits of divine working who are devoid of reverence for heaven. It is
also shown in a mystery that the Son of God, in order to restore the
Church, took upon Himself the mystery of a human body, casting off the
Jewish people, from whom the counsellor and the prophet and the miracles
of the divine benefits were taken away, <span
id="fr_3331"></span>[3332](#fn_3331) because that as it were by a kind
of national blemish they were not willing to believe in the Son of God.

[Next: Chapter IV. By the example of Anna St. Ambrose shows what ought
to be the life of widows, and shows that she was an example of chastity
at every age. From this he argues that there are three degrees of the
same virtue, all of which are included in the Church, and sets forth
several examples in Mary, in Anna, and in Susanna. But, he adds, the
state of virginity is superior to either of the others, but that a widow
ought to take greater care for the preservation of her good
name.](2100353)
