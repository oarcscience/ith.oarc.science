<span id="iv.i.iv.ii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.iv.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.i.iv.ii-p1"></span>The discussions among philosophers about
the comparison between what is virtuous and what is useful have nothing
to do with Christians. For with them nothing is useful which is not
just. What are the duties of perfection, and what are ordinary duties?
The same words often suit different things in different ways. Lastly, a
just man never seeks his own advantage at the cost of another’s
disadvantage, but rather is always on the lookout for what is useful to
others.

<span id="iv.i.iv.ii-p2"></span>8. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.ii-p2.1"></span>As</span> we have already spoken about the
two former subjects, wherein we discussed what is virtuous and what is
useful, there follows now the question whether we ought to compare what
is virtuous and useful together, and to ask which we must follow. For,
as we have already discussed the matter as to whether a thing is
virtuous or wicked, and in another place whether it is useful or
useless, so here some think we ought to find out whether a thing is
virtuous or useful. <span id="fr_599"></span>[600](#fn_599)

<span id="iv.i.iv.ii-p4"></span>9. I am induced to do this, lest I
should seem to be allowing that these two are mutually opposed to one
another, when I have already shown them to be one. For I said that
nothing can be virtuous but what is useful, and nothing can be useful
but what is virtuous. <span id="fr_600"></span>[601](#fn_600) For we do
not follow the wisdom of the flesh, whereby the usefulness that consists
in an abundance of money is held to be of most value, but we follow that
wisdom which is of God, whereby <span id="page_69">p. 69</span> <span
id="iv.i.iv.ii-Page_69"></span>those things which are greatly valued in
this world are counted but as loss.

<span id="iv.i.iv.ii-p6"></span>10. For this <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.iv.ii-p6.1"></span>χατόρθωμα</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.iv.ii-p6.2"></span>,</span> which is duty carried out entirely
and in perfection, starts from the true source of virtue. <span
id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601) On this follows another, or ordinary
duty. This shows by its name that no hard or extraordinary practice of
virtue is involved, for it can be common to very many. The desire to
save money is the usual practice with many. To enjoy a well-prepared
banquet and a pleasant meal is a general habit; but to fast or to use
self-restraint is the practice of but few, and not to be desirous of
another’s goods is a virtue rarely found. On the other hand, to wish to
deprive another of his property—and not to be content with one’s
due—here one will find many to keep company with one. Those (the
philosopher would say) are primary duties—these ordinary. <span
id="fr_602"></span>[603](#fn_602) The primary are found but with few,
the ordinary with the many.

<span id="iv.i.iv.ii-p9"></span>11. Again, the same words often have a
different meaning. For instance, we call God good and a man good; but it
bears in each case quite a different meaning. <span
id="fr_603"></span>[604](#fn_603) We call God just in one sense, man in
another. So, too, there is a difference in meaning when we call God wise
and a man wise. This we are taught in the Gospel: “Be ye perfect even as
your Father Who is in heaven is perfect.” <span
id="fr_604"></span>[605](#fn_604) I read again that Paul was perfect and
yet not perfect. For when he said: “Not as though I had already
attained, either were already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may
apprehend it.” <span id="fr_605"></span>[606](#fn_605) Immediately he
added: “We, then, that are perfect.” <span
id="fr_606"></span>[607](#fn_606) There is a twofold form of perfection,
the one having but ordinary, the other the highest worth. The one
availing here, the other hereafter. The one in accordance with human
powers, the other with the perfection of the world to come. But God is
just through all, wise above all, perfect in all.

<span id="iv.i.iv.ii-p14"></span>12. There is also diversity even among
men themselves. Daniel, of whom it was said: “Who is wiser than
Daniel?” <span id="fr_607"></span>[608](#fn_607) was wise in a different
sense to what others are. The same may be said of Solomon, who was
filled with wisdom, above all the wisdom of the ancients, and more than
all the wise men of Egypt. <span id="fr_608"></span>[609](#fn_608) To be
wise as men are in general is quite a different thing to being really
wise. He who is ordinarily wise is wise for temporal matters, is wise
for himself, so as to deprive another of something and get it for
himself. He who is really wise does not know how to regard his own
advantage, but looks with all his desire to that which is eternal, and
to that which is seemly and virtuous, seeking not what is useful for
himself, but for all.

<span id="iv.i.iv.ii-p17"></span>13. Let this, then, be our rule, <span
id="fr_609"></span>[610](#fn_609) so that we may never go wrong between
two things, one virtuous, the other useful. The upright man must never
think of depriving another of anything, nor must he ever wish to
increase his own advantage to the disadvantage of another. This rule the
Apostle gives thee, saying: “All things are lawful, but all things are
not expedient; all things are lawful, but all things edify not. Let no
man seek his own, but each one another’s.” <span
id="fr_610"></span>[611](#fn_610) That is: Let no man seek his own
advantage, but another’s; let no man seek his own honour, but another’s.
Wherefore he says in another place: “Let each esteem other better than
themselves, looking not each one to his own things, but to the things of
others.” <span id="fr_611"></span>[612](#fn_611)

<span id="iv.i.iv.ii-p21"></span>14. And let no one seek his own favour
or his own praise, but another’s. This we can plainly see declared in
the book of Proverbs, where the Holy Spirit says through Solomon: “My
son, if thou be wise, be wise for thyself and thy neighbours; but if
thou turn out evil, thou alone shalt bear it.” <span
id="fr_612"></span>[613](#fn_612) The wise man gives counsel to others,
as the upright man does, and shares with him in wearing the form of
either virtue.

[Next: Chapter III. The rule given about not seeking one's own gain is
established, first by the examples of Christ, next by the meaning of the
word, and lastly by the very form and uses of our limbs. Wherefore the
writer shows what a crime it is to deprive another of what is useful,
since the law of nature as well as the divine law is broken by such
wickedness. Further, by its means we also lose that gift which makes us
superior to other living creatures; and lastly, through it civil laws
are abused and treated with the greatest contempt.](2100097)
