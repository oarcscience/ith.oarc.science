<p class="c32"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xii-p1"></A>We must refer the fact that Christ is said to speak nothing of Himself, to His human nature. After explaining how it is right to say that He hears and sees the Father as being God, He shows conclusively, by a large number of proofs, that the Son of God is not a creature.</p>  
<p class="c22"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xii-p2"></A>132. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xii-p2.1"></A>Are</span> we indeed to bring the Son of God to such a low estate that He may not know how to act or speak, except as He hears, and are we to suppose that a fixed measure of action or of speech is assigned to Him, because it is written: &#8220;I speak not of Myself,&#8221; and, further on: &#8220;As the Father hath said unto Me, even so I speak&#8221;?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2695"></A><A HREF="#fn_2695"><FONT SIZE="1">2696</FONT></A>
 But those words have reference to the obedience of the flesh, or else to the faith in the Unity. For many learned men allow that the Son hears, and that the Father speaks to the Son through the unity of their Nature; for that which the Son, through the unity of their will, knows that the Father wills, He seems to have heard.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xii-p4"></A>133. Whereby is meant no personal duty, but an indivisible sentence of co-operation. For this does not signify any actual hearing of words, but the unity of will and of power, which exists both in the Father and in the Son. He has stated that this exists also in the Holy Spirit, in another place, saying, &#8220;For He shall not speak of Himself, but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2696"></A><A HREF="#fn_2696"><FONT SIZE="1">2697</FONT></A>
 so that we may learn that whatsoever the Spirit says, the Son also says; and whatsoever the Son says, the Father says also; for there is one mind and one mode of working in the Trinity. For, as the Father is seen in the Son, not indeed in bodily appearance, but in the unity of the Godhead, so also the Father speaks in the Son, not with a voice of earth, not with a human sound, but in the unity of Their work. So when He had said: &#8220;The Father that dwelleth in Me, He speaketh; and the works that I do, He doeth;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2697"></A><A HREF="#fn_2697"><FONT SIZE="1">2698</FONT></A>
 He added: &#8220;Believe Me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me; or else believe Me for the very work&#146;s sake.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2698"></A><A HREF="#fn_2698"><FONT SIZE="1">2699</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xii-p8"></A>134. This is what we understand according to the whole course of the holy Scriptures; but the Arians, who will not think of God the things that be right, may be put to silence by an example just suited to their deserts; that they may not believe everything in carnal fashion, since they themselves do not see the works of their father the devil with bodily eyes. So the Lord has declared of their fellows the Jews, saying: &#8220;Ye do what ye have seen your father doing;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2699"></A><A HREF="#fn_2699"><FONT SIZE="1">2700</FONT></A>
 though they are reproved not because they saw the work of the devil, but because they did his will, since the devil unseen works out sin in them in accordance with their own wickedness. We have written this, as the Apostle did, because of the folly of these traitors.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2700"></A><A HREF="#fn_2700"><FONT SIZE="1">2701</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xii-p11"></A>135. But we have sufficiently proved by examples from Scripture that it is a property of the unity of the divine majesty that the Father should abide in the Son, and that the Son should seem to have heard from the Father those things which He speaks. How else can we understand the unity of majesty than by the knowledge that the same deference is paid to the Father and the Son? For what can be better put than the Apostle&#146;s saying that the Lord of glory was crucified?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2701"></A><A HREF="#fn_2701"><FONT SIZE="1">2702</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xii-p13"></A>136. The Son then is the God of glory and the Lord of glory, but glory is not subject to creatures; the Son therefore is not a creature.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xii-p14"></A>137. The Son is the Image of the Father&#146;s Substance;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2702"></A><A HREF="#fn_2702"><FONT SIZE="1">2703</FONT></A>
 but every creature is unlike that divine Substance, but the Son of the Father is not unlike God; therefore the Son is not a creature.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xii-p16"></A>138. The Son thought it not robbery to be equal with God;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2703"></A><A HREF="#fn_2703"><FONT SIZE="1">2704</FONT></A>
 but no creature is equal with God, the Son, however, is equal; therefore the Son is not a creature.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xii-p18"></A>139. Every creature is changeable; but the Son of God is not changeable; therefore the Son of God is not a creature.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xii-p19"></A>140. Every creature meets with chance occurrences of good and evil after the powers of its nature, and also feels their passing away; but nothing can pass away from or bring addition to the Son of God in His Godhead; therefore the Son of God is not a creature.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xii-p20"></A>141. Every work of His God will bring into judgment;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2704"></A><A HREF="#fn_2704"><FONT SIZE="1">2705</FONT></A>
 but the Son of God is not brought into judgment; for He Himself judges; therefore the Son of God is not a creature.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xii-p22"></A>142. Lastly, that thou mayest understand the unity, the Saviour in speaking of His sheep says: &#8220;No man is able to pluck them out of My hand. My Father Which gave them to Me is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out of My Father&#146;s hand. I and My Father are one.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2705"></A><A HREF="#fn_2705"><FONT SIZE="1">2706</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xii-p24"></A>143. So the Son gives life as does the  <A NAME="page_302"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 302</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iv.vii.xii-Page_302"></A>Father. &#8220;For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom He will.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2706"></A><A HREF="#fn_2706"><FONT SIZE="1">2707</FONT></A>
 So the Son raises up as does the Father: so too the Son preserves as does the Father. He Who is not unequal in grace, how is He unequal in power? So also the Son does not destroy, as neither does the Father. Therefore lest any one should believe there were two Gods, or should imagine a diversity of power, He said that He was one with His Father. How can a creature say that? Therefore the Son of God is not a creature.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.xii-p26"></A>144. It is not the same thing to rule as to serve; but Christ is both a King and the Son of a King. The Son of God therefore is not a servant. Every creature, however, gives service. But the Son of God, Who makes servants become the sons of God, does not give service. Therefore the Son of God is not a servant.</p>

<A HREF="2100266">Next: Chapter XII. He confirms what has been already said, by the parable of the rich man who went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom; and shows that when the Son delivers up the kingdom to the Father, we must not regard the fact that the Father is said to put all things in subjection under Him, in a disparaging way. Here we are the kingdom of Christ, and in Christ's kingdom. Hereafter we shall be in the kingdom of God, where the Trinity will reign together.</A></CENTER>
