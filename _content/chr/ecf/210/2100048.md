#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xxxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxvi-p1"></span>One of the duties of fortitude is to
keep the weak from receiving injury; another, to check the wrong motions
of our own souls; a third, both to disregard humiliations, and to do
what is right with an even mind. All these clearly ought to be fulfilled
by all Christians, and especially by the clergy.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxvi-p2"></span>179. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>The</span> glory of fortitude, therefore,
does not rest only on the strength of one’s body or of one’s arms, but
rather on the courage of the mind. <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267) Nor is the law of courage exercised in
causing, but in driving away all harm. He who does not keep harm off a
friend, if he can, is as much in fault as he who causes it. Wherefore
holy Moses gave this as a first proof of his fortitude in war. For when
he saw an Hebrew receiving hard treatment at the hands of an Egyptian,
he defended him, and laid low the Egyptian and hid him in the
sand. <span id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268) Solomon also says:
“Deliver him that is led to death.” <span
id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxvi-p6"></span>180. From whence, then, Cicero and
Panætius, or even Aristotle, got these ideas is perfectly clear. For
though living before these two, Job had said: “I delivered the poor out
of the hand of the strong, and I aided the fatherless for whom there was
no helper. Let the blessing of him that was ready to perish come upon
me.” <span id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270) Was not he most brave in
that he bore so nobly the attacks of the devil, and overcame him with
the powers of his mind? <span id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271) Nor have
we cause to doubt the fortitude of him to whom the Lord said: “Gird up
thy loins like a man. Put on loftiness and power. Humble every one that
doeth wrong.” <span id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272) The Apostle <span
id="page_31">p. 31</span> <span id="iv.i.ii.xxxvi-Page_31"></span>also
says: “Ye have a strong consolation.” <span
id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273) He, then, is brave who finds
consolation in any grief.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxvi-p11"></span>181. And in very truth, rightly is
that called fortitude, when a man conquers himself, restrains his anger,
yields and gives way to no allurements, is not put out by misfortunes,
nor gets elated by good success, and does not get carried away by every
varying change as by some chance wind. <span
id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274) But what is more noble and splendid
than to train the mind, keep down the flesh, and reduce it to
subjection, so that it may obey commands, listen to reason, and in
undergoing labours readily carry out the intention and wish of the mind?

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxvi-p13"></span>182. This, then, is the first notion
of fortitude. For fortitude of the mind can be regarded in two
ways. <span id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275) First, as it counts all
externals as very unimportant, and looks on them as rather superfluous
and to be despised than to be sought after. Secondly, as it strives
after those things which are the highest, and all things in which one
can see anything moral (or as the Greeks call it, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.i.ii.xxxvi-p14.1"></span>πρέπον</span>,) with
all the powers of the mind. For what can be more noble than to train thy
mind so as not to place a high value on riches and pleasures and
honours, nor to waste all thy care on these? When thy mind is thus
disposed, thou must consider how all that is virtuous and seemly must be
placed before everything else; and thou must so fix thy mind upon that,
that if aught happens which may break thy spirit, whether loss of
property, or the reception of fewer honours, or the disparagement of
unbelievers, thou mayest not feel it, as though thou wert above such
things; nay, so that even dangers which menace thy safety, if undertaken
at the call of justice, may not trouble thee.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxvi-p15"></span>183. This is the true fortitude
which Christ’s warrior has, who receives not the crown unless he strives
lawfully. <span id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276) Or does that call to
fortitude seem to thee but a poor one: “Tribulation worketh patience,
and patience, experience, and experience, hope”? <span
id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277) See how many a contest there is, yet
but one crown! That call none gives, but he who was strengthened in
Christ Jesus, and whose flesh had no rest. Affliction on all sides,
fighting without and fears within. <span
id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278) And though in dangers, in countless
labours, in prisons, in deaths <span id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279)
—he was not broken in spirit, but fought so as to become more powerful
through his infirmities.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxvi-p20"></span>184. Think, then, how he teaches
those who enter upon their duties in the Church, that they ought to have
contempt for all earthly things: “If, then, ye be dead with Christ from
the elements of this world, why do ye act as though living in the world?
Touch not, taste not, handle not, which all are to perish with the
using.” <span id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280) And further: “If ye then
be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, not those
things which are on the earth.” <span id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281)
And again: “Mortify, therefore, your members which are on the
earth.” <span id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282) This, indeed, is meant
for all the faithful. But thee, especially, my son, he urges to despise
riches and to avoid profane and old wives fables—allowing nothing but
this: “Exercise thyself unto godliness, for bodily exercise profiteth a
little, but godliness is profitable unto all things.” <span
id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxvi-p25"></span>185. Let, then, godliness exercise
thee unto justice, continence, gentleness, that thou mayest avoid
childish acts, and that rooted and grounded in grace thou mayest fight
the good fight of faith. <span id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284)
Entangle not thyself in the affairs of this life, for thou art fighting
for God. <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285) For if he who fights
for the emperor is forbidden by human laws to enter upon lawsuits, to do
any legal business, or to sell merchandise; how much more ought he who
enters upon the warfare of faith to keep from every kind of business,
being satisfied with the produce of his own little bit of land, if he
has it? If he has not that, let him be content with the pay he will get
for his service. Here is a good witness to this fact, who says: “I have
been young and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken,
nor his seed begging bread.” <span id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286)
That is the true rest and temperance of the mind which is not excited by
the desire of gain, nor tormented by the fear of want.
