#### <span id="iv.vii.iv.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.iii-p1"></span>Virgins are exhorted to avoid visits,
to observe modesty, to be silent during the celebration of the Mysteries
after the example of Mary. Then after narrating the story of a heathen
youth, and saying of a poet, St. Ambrose relates a miracle wrought by a
holy priest.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.iii-p2"></span>9. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.iv.iii-p2.1"></span>I will</span>, too, that visits amongst
the younger, except such as may be due to parents and those of like age,
be few. For modesty is worn away by intercourse, and boldness breaks
forth, laughter creeps in, and bashfulness is lessened, whilst
politeness is studied. Not to answer one who asks a question is
childishness, to answer is nonsense. I should prefer, therefore, that
conversation should rather be wanting to a virgin, than abound. For if
women are bidden to keep silence in churches, even about divine things,
and to ask their husbands at home, what do we think should be the
caution of virgins, in whom modesty adorns their age, and silence
commends their modesty.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.iii-p3"></span>10. Was it a small sign of modesty
that when Rebecca came to wed Isaac, and saw her bridegroom, she took a
veil, <span id="fr_3272"></span>[3273](#fn_3272) that she might not be
seen before they were united? Certainly the fair virgin feared not for
her beauty, but for her modesty. What of Rachel, how she, when Jacob’s
kiss had been taken, <span id="fr_3273"></span>[3274](#fn_3273) wept and
groaned, and would not have ceased weeping had she not known him to be a
kinsman? So she both observed what was due to modesty, and omitted not
kindly affection. But if it is said to a man: “Gaze not on a maid, lest
she cause thee to fall,” <span id="fr_3274"></span>[3275](#fn_3274) what
is to be said to a consecrated virgin, who, if she loves, sins in mind;
if she is loved, in act also?

<span id="iv.vii.iv.iii-p7"></span>11. The virtue of silence, especially
in Church, is very great. Let no sentence of the divine lessons escape
you; if you give ear, restrain your voice, utter no word with your lips
which you would wish to recall, <span id="page_383">p. 383</span> <span
id="iv.vii.iv.iii-Page_383"></span>but let your boldness to speak be
sparing. For in truth in much speaking there is abundance of sin. <span
id="fr_3275"></span>[3276](#fn_3275) To the murderer it was said: “Thou
hast sinned, be silent,” <span id="fr_3276"></span>[3277](#fn_3276) that
he might not sin more; but to the virgin it must be said, “Be silent
lest thou sin.” For Mary, as we read, kept in heart all things that were
said concerning her Son, <span id="fr_3277"></span>[3278](#fn_3277) and
do you, when any passage is read where Christ is announced as about to
come, or is shown to have come, not make a noise by talking, but attend.
Is anything more unbecoming than the divine words should be so drowned
by talking, as not to be heard, believed, or made known, that the
sacraments should be indistinctly heard through the sound of voices,
that prayer should be hindered when offered for the salvation of all?

<span id="iv.vii.iv.iii-p11"></span>12. The Gentiles pay respect to
their idols by silence, of which this instance is given: As Alexander,
the king of the Macedonians, was sacrificing, the sleeve of a barbarian
lad who was lighting the lamp for him caught fire and burnt his body,
yet he remained without moving and neither betrayed the pain by a groan,
nor showed his suffering by silent tears. Such was the discipline of
reverence in a barbarian lad that nature was subdued. Yet he feared not
the gods, who were no gods, but the king. For why should he fear those
who if the same fire had caught them would have burnt?

<span id="iv.vii.iv.iii-p12"></span>13. How much better still is it
where a youth at his father’s banquet is bidden not to betray by coarse
gestures his unchaste loves. And do you, holy virgin, abstain from
groans, cries, coughing, and laughter at the Mystery. Can you not at the
Mystery do what he did at a banquet? Let virginity be first marked by
the voice, let modesty close the mouth, let religion remove weakness,
and habit instruct nature. Let her gravity first announce a virgin to
me, a modest approach, a sober gait, a bashful countenance, and let the
march of virtue be preceded by the evidence of integrity. That virgin is
not sufficiently worthy of approval who has to be enquired about when
she is seen.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.iii-p13"></span>14. There is common story how, when
the excessive croaking of frogs was resounding in the ears of the
faithful people, the priest of God bade them be silent, and show
reverence to the sacred words, and then at once the noise was stilled.
Shall then the marshes keep silence and not the frogs? And shall
irrational animals re-acknowledge by reverence what they know not by
nature? While the shamelessness of men is such, that many care not to
pay that respect to the religious feelings of their minds, which they do
to the pleasure of their ears.

[Next: Chapter IV. Having summed up the address of Liberius, St. Ambrose
passes on to the virtues of his sister, especially her fasts, which
however he advises her to moderate to some extent, and to exercise
herself in other matters, after the example which he adduces. Especially
he recommends the Lord's Prayer, and the repetition of Psalms by night,
and the recitation of the Creed before daylight.](2100344)
