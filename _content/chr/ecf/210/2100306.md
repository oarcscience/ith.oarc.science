#### <span id="iv.vi.iii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.i-p1"></span>St. Ambrose gives additional rules
concerning repentance, and shows that it must not be delayed.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.i-p2.1"></span>Although</span> in the former book we have
written many things which may tend to the more perfect practice of
repentance, yet inasmuch as a great deal more may be added, we will
continue the repast so as not to seem to have relinquished the
provisions of our teaching only half consumed.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.i-p3"></span>2. For repentance must be taken in hand
not only anxiously, but also quickly, lest perchance that father of the
house in the Gospel who planted a fig-tree in his vineyard should come
and seek fruit on it, and finding none, say to the vine-dresser: “Cut it
down, why doth it cumber the ground?” <span
id="fr_3048"></span>[3049](#fn_3048) And unless the vine-dresser should
intercede and say: “Lord, let it alone this year also, until I dig about
it and dung it, and if it bear fruit—well; but if not let it be cut
down.” <span id="fr_3049"></span>[3050](#fn_3049)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.i-p6"></span>3. Let us then dung this field which we
possess, and imitate those hard-working farmers, who are not ashamed to
satiate the land with rich dung and to scatter the grimy ashes over the
field, that they may gather more abundant crops.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.i-p7"></span>4. And the Apostle teaches us how to
dung it, saying: “I count all things but dung, that I may gain
Christ,” <span id="fr_3050"></span>[3051](#fn_3050) and he, through evil
report and good report, attained to pleasing Christ. For he had read
that Abraham, when confessing himself to be but dust and ashes, <span
id="fr_3051"></span>[3052](#fn_3051) in his deep humility found favour
with God. He had read how Job, sitting among the ashes, <span
id="fr_3052"></span>[3053](#fn_3052) regained all that he had
lost. <span id="fr_3053"></span>[3054](#fn_3053) He had heard in the
utterance of David, how God “raiseth the poor out of the dust, and
lifteth the needy out of the dunghill.” <span
id="fr_3054"></span>[3055](#fn_3054)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.i-p13"></span>5. Let us then not be ashamed to
confess our sins unto the Lord. Shame indeed there is when each makes
known his sins, but that shame, as it were, ploughs his land, removes
the ever-recurring brambles, prunes the thorns, and gives life to the
fruits which he believed were dead. Follow him who, by diligently
ploughing his field, sought for eternal fruit: “Being reviled we bless,
being persecuted we endure, being defamed we entreat, we are made as the
offscouring of the world.” <span id="fr_3055"></span>[3056](#fn_3055) If
you plough after this fashion you will sow spiritual seed. Plough that
you may get rid of sin and gain fruit. He ploughed so as to destroy in
himself the last tendency to persecution. What more could Christ give to
lead us on to the pursuit of perfection, than to convert and then give
us for a teacher one who was a persecutor?

[Next: Chapter II. A passage quoted by the heretics against repentance
is explained in two ways, the first being that Heb. vi. 4 refers to the
impossibility of being baptized again; the second, that what is
impossible with man is possible with God.](2100307)
