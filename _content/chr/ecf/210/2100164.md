#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xii-p1"></span>From the fact that St. Paul has shown
that the light of the Godhead which the three apostles worshipped in
Christ is in the Trinity, it is made clear that the Spirit also is to be
worshipped. It is shown from the words themselves that the Spirit is
intended by the apostles. The Godhead of the same Spirit is proved from
the fact that He has a temple wherein He dwells not as a priest, but as
God: and is worshipped with the Father and the Son; whence is understood
the oneness of nature in Them.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xii-p2"></span>86. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.xii-p2.1"></span>But</span> does any one deny that the
Godhead of the eternal Trinity is to be worshipped? whereas the
Scriptures also express the inexplicable Majesty of the Divine Trinity,
as the Apostle says elsewhere: “Since God, Who said that light should
shine out of darkness, shined in our hearts to give the light of the
knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xii-p4"></span>87. The apostles truly saw this glory,
when the Lord Jesus on the mount shone with the light of His Godhead:
“The apostles,” it says, “saw it and fell on their face.” <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347) Do not you think that they even, as
they fell, worshipped, when they could not with their bodily eyes endure
the brightness of the divine splendour, and the glory of eternal light
dulled the keenness of mortal sight? Or what else did they who saw His
glory say at that time, except, “O come let us worship and fall down
before Him”? <span id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348) For “God shined
in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in
the face of Jesus Christ.” <span id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xii-p8"></span>88. Who is He, then, Who shined that
we might know God in the face of Jesus Christ? For he said, “God
shined,” that the glory of God might be known in the face of Jesus
Christ. Whom else do we think but the manifested Spirit? Or who else is
there besides the Holy Spirit to Whom the power of the Godhead may be
referred? For they who exclude the Spirit must necessarily bring in
another, who may with the Father and the Son receive the glory of the
Godhead.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xii-p9"></span>89. Let us then go back to the same
words: “It is God Who shined in our hearts to give the light of the
knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.” You have
Christ plainly set forth. For Whose glory is said to give light but that
of <span id="page_148">p. 148</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iv.xii-Page_148"></span>the Spirit? So, then, he set forth God
Himself, since he spoke of the glory of God; if of the Father, it
remains that “He who said that light should shine out of darkness, and
shine in our hearts,” be understood to be the Holy Spirit, for we cannot
venerate any other with the Father and the Son. If, then, you understand
the Spirit, Him also has the Apostle called God; it is necessary, then,
that you also confess the Godhead of the Spirit, who now deny it.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xii-p10"></span>90. But how shamelessly do you deny
this, since you have read that the Holy Spirit has a temple. For it is
written: “Ye are the temple of God, and the Holy Spirit dwelleth in
you.” <span id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350) Now God has a temple, a
creature has no true temple. But the Spirit, Who dwelleth in us, has a
temple. For it is written: “Your members are temples of the Holy
Spirit.” <span id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xii-p13"></span>91. But He does not dwell in the
temple as a priest, nor as a minister, but as God, since the Lord Jesus
Himself said: “I will dwell in them, and will walk among them, and will
be their God, and they shall be My people.” <span
id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352) And David says: “The Lord is in His
holy temple.” <span id="fr_1353"></span>[1354](#fn_1353) Therefore the
Spirit dwells in His holy temple, as the Father dwells and as the Son
dwells, Who says: “I and the Father will come, and will make Our abode
with him.” <span id="fr_1354"></span>[1355](#fn_1354)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xii-p17"></span>92. But the Father abides in us
through the Spirit, Whom He has given us. How, then, can different
natures abide together? Certainly it is impossible. But the Spirit
abides with the Father and the Son. Whence, too, the Apostle joined the
Communion of the Holy Spirit with the grace of Jesus Christ and the love
of God, saying: “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of
God, and the Communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all.” <span
id="fr_1355"></span>[1356](#fn_1355)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xii-p19"></span>91. We observe, then, that the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit abide in one and the same
\[subject\] through the oneness of the same nature. Therefore, He Who
dwells in the temple has divine power, for as of the Father and of the
Son, so are we also the temple of the Holy Spirit; not many temples, but
one temple, for it is the temple of one Power.

[Next: Chapter XIII. To those who object that Catholics, when they
ascribe Godhead to the Holy Spirit, introduce three Gods, it is
answered, that by the same argument they themselves bring in two Gods,
unless they deny Godhead to the Son; after which the orthodox doctrine
is set forth.](2100165)
