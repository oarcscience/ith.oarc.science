#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xlvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLVI.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlvi-p1"></span>A twofold division of what is seemly
is given. Next it is shown that what is according to nature is virtuous,
and what is otherwise must be looked on as shameful. This division is
explained by examples.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlvi-p2"></span>231. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xlvi-p2.1"></span>Seemliness</span>, therefore, which stands
conspicuous has a twofold division. <span
id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326) For there is what we may call a
general seemliness, which is diffused through all that is virtuous, and
is seen, as one may say, in the whole body. It is also individual, and
shows itself clearly in some particular part. The first has a consistent
form and the perfection of what is virtuous harmonizing in every action.
For all its life is consistent with itself, and there is no discrepancy
in anything. The other is concerned when there is any special action
done in a virtuous course of life.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlvi-p4"></span>232. At the same time let us note that
it is seemly to live in accordance with nature, and to pass our time in
accordance with it, and that whatever is contrary to nature is shameful.
For the Apostle asks: “Is it comely that a woman pray unto God
uncovered; doth not nature itself teach you that if a man have long
hair, it is a shame unto him? For it is contrary to nature.” And again
he says: “If a woman have long hair, it is a glory unto her.” <span
id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327) It is according to nature, since her
hair is given her for a veil, for it is a natural veil. Thus nature
arranges for us both character and <span id="page_38">p. 38</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.xlvi-Page_38"></span>appearance, and we ought to observe her
directions. Would that we could guard her innocence, and not change what
we have received by our wickedness!

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlvi-p6"></span>233. We have that general seemliness;
for God made the beauty of this world. We have it also in its parts; for
when God made the light, and marked off the day from the night, when He
made heaven, and separated land and seas, when He set the sun and moon
and stars to shine on the earth, He approved of them all one by one.
Therefore this comeliness, which shone forth in each single part of the
world, was resplendent in the whole, as the Book of Wisdom shows,
saying: “I existed, in whom He rejoiced when He was glad at the
completion of the world.” <span id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328)
Likewise also in the building up of the human body each single member is
pleasing, but the right adjustment of the members all together delights
us far more. For thus they seem to be united and fitted in one
harmonious whole.
