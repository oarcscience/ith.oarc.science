<span id="iv.iv.v.ii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.v.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.iv.v.ii-p1"></span>The incidents properly affecting the
body which Christ for our sake took upon Him are not to be accounted to
His Godhead, in respect whereof He is the Most Highest. To deny which is
to say that the Father was incarnate. When we read that God is one, and
that there is none other beside Him, or that He alone has immortality,
this must be understood as true of Christ also, not only to avoid the
sinful heresy above-mentioned (Patripassianism), but also because the
activity of the Father and the Son is declared to be one and the same.

<span id="iv.iv.v.ii-p2"></span>7. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.ii-p2.1"></span>It</span> was a bodily weakness, then, that
is to say, a weakness of ours, that He hungered; when He wept, and was
sorrowful even unto death, it was of our nature. Why ascribe the
properties and incidents of our nature to the Godhead? That He was even,
as we are told, “made,” is a property of a body. Thus, indeed, we read:
“Sion our mother shall say: ‘He is a man,’ and in her He was made man,
and the Most High Himself laid her foundations.” <span
id="fr_2107"></span>[2108](#fn_2107) “He was made man,” mark you, not
“He was made God.” <span id="fr_2108"></span>[2109](#fn_2108)

<span id="iv.iv.v.ii-p5"></span>8. But what is He Who is at once the
Most High and man, what but “the Mediator between God and man, the man
Christ Jesus Who gave Himself as a ransom for us”? <span
id="fr_2109"></span>[2110](#fn_2109) This place indeed refers properly
to His Incarnation, for our redemption was made by His Blood, our pardon
comes through His Power, our life is secured through His Grace. He gives
as the Most High, He prays as man. The one is the office of the Creator,
the other of a Redeemer. Be the gifts as distinct as they may, yet the
Giver is one, for it was fitting <span
id="fr_2110"></span>[2111](#fn_2110) that our Maker should be our
Redeemer.

<span id="iv.iv.v.ii-p8"></span>9. Who indeed can deny that we have
plain evidence that Christ is the Most High? He who knows otherwise
makes the sacrament of Incarnation to be the work of God the
Father. <span id="fr_2111"></span>[2112](#fn_2111) But that Christ is
the Most High is removed beyond doubt by what Scripture hath said in
another place, concerning the mystery of the Passion: “The Most High
sent forth His Voice, and the earth was shaken.” <span
id="fr_2112"></span>[2113](#fn_2112) And in the Gospel you may read:
“And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the Highest; for thou
shalt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare His ways.” <span
id="fr_2113"></span>[2114](#fn_2113) Who is “the Highest”? The Son of
God. He, then, Who is the Most High God is Christ.

<span id="iv.iv.v.ii-p12"></span>10. Again, whilst God is everywhere
said to be One God, the Son of God is not separated from this Unity. For
He Who is the <span id="page_244">p. 244</span> <span
id="iv.iv.v.ii-Page_244"></span>Most High is alone, as it is written:
“And let them know that Thy Name is the Lord: Thou alone art Most High
over all the earth.” <span id="fr_2114"></span>[2115](#fn_2114)

<span id="iv.iv.v.ii-p14"></span>11. And so the adversaries’ injurious
conclusion is rejected with contempt and disgrace, which they drew from
the Scripture speaking of God: “Who alone hath immortality and dwelleth
in light unapproachable;” <span id="fr_2115"></span>[2116](#fn_2115) for
these words are written of God, which Name belongs equally to Father and
to Son.

<span id="iv.iv.v.ii-p16"></span>12. If, indeed, wheresoever they read
the Name of God, they deny that there is any thought of the Son \[as
well as the Father\], they blaspheme, inasmuch as they deny the Son’s
Divine Sovereignty, and they shall appear as though they shared the
sinful error of the Sabellians in teaching the Incarnation of the
Father. Let them, indeed explain how they can fail to interpret in a
sense blasphemous to the Father the words of the Apostle: “In Whom ye
did also rise again, by faith in the working of God, Who raised Him from
the dead.” <span id="fr_2116"></span>[2117](#fn_2116) Let them also take
warning from what follows of what they are running upon—for this is what
comes after: “And though ye were dead in your sins and the
uncircumcision of your flesh, He quickened us with Him, pardoning us all
our offences, blotting out the handwriting of the Ordinance, which was
opposed to us, and removed it from our midst, nailing it to His Cross,
divesting Himself of the flesh.” <span
id="fr_2117"></span>[2118](#fn_2117)

<span id="iv.iv.v.ii-p19"></span>13. We are not, then, to suppose that
the Father Who raised the flesh is alone \[God\]; nor, again, are we to
suppose the like of the Son, Whose Body <span
id="fr_2118"></span>[2119](#fn_2118) was raised again. He Who raised,
did surely also quicken; and He who quickened, also pardoned sins; He
who pardoned sins, also blotted out the handwriting; He Who blotted out
the handwriting, also nailed it to the Cross: He who nailed it to the
Cross, divested Himself of the flesh. But it was not the Father Who
divested Himself of the flesh; for *not* the Father, but, as we read,
the Word was made flesh. <span id="fr_2119"></span>[2120](#fn_2119) You
see, then, that the Arians, in dividing the Father from the Son, run
into danger of saying that the Father endured the Passion.

<span id="iv.iv.v.ii-p22"></span>14. We, however, can easily show that
the words treat of the Son’s action, for the Son Himself indeed raised
His own Body again, as He Himself said: “Destroy this Temple, and in
three days I will raise it again.” <span
id="fr_2120"></span>[2121](#fn_2120) And He Himself quickens us together
with His Body: “For as the Father raiseth the dead and quickeneth them,
so also the Son quickeneth Whom He will.” <span
id="fr_2121"></span>[2122](#fn_2121) And He Himself hath granted
forgiveness for sins, saying, “Thy sins be forgiven thee.” <span
id="fr_2122"></span>[2123](#fn_2122) He too hath nailed the handwriting
of the record to His Cross, in that He was crucified, and suffered in
the body. Nor did any divest Himself of the flesh, save the Son of God,
Who invested Himself therewith. He, therefore, Who hath achieved the
work of our resurrection is plainly pointed out to be very God.

The R.V. renders “Yea, of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one
was born in her.” The verse is rather prophetic of the universality of
Christ’s Church than of the Incarnation.

<span id="iv.iv.v.ii-p4"></span> He could not “be made” God if we use
the Name “God” in its proper sense, but St. Ambrose probably had in his
mind the sense which the Arians attached to the name, as applicable to
the Son. According to them, it was a sort of “courtesy-title.”

[Next: Chapter III. That the Father and the Son must not be divided is
proved by the words of the Apostle, seeing that it is befitting to the
Son that He should be blessed, only Potentate, and immortal, by nature,
that is, and not by grace, as even the angels themselves are immortal,
and that He should dwell in the unapproachable light. How it is that the
Father and the Son are alike and equally said to be “alone.”](2100225)
