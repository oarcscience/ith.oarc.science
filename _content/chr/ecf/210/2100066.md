#### <span id="iv.i.iii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.i.iii.iii-p1"></span>The definition of blessedness as drawn
from the Scriptures is considered and proved. It cannot be enhanced by
external good fortune, nor can it be weakened by misfortune.

<span id="iv.i.iii.iii-p2"></span>8. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>As</span>, then, knowledge, so far as it
stands alone, is put aside either as worthless, according to the
superfluous discussions of the philosophers, <span
id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386) or as but an imperfect idea, let us
now note how clearly the divine Scriptures explain a thing about which
we see the philosophers held so many involved and perplexing ideas. For
the Scriptures state that nothing is good but what is virtuous, and
declare that virtue is blessed in every circumstance, and that it is
never enhanced by either corporal or other external good fortune, nor is
it weakened by adversity. No state is so blessed as that wherein one is
free from sin, is filled with innocence, and is fully supplied with the
grace of God. For it is written: “Blessed is the man that hath not
walked in the counsel of the ungodly, and hath not stood in the way of
sinners, and hath not sat in the seat of pestilence, but in the law of
the Lord was his delight.” <span id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387) And
again: “Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the
Lord.” <span id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388)

<span id="iv.i.iii.iii-p6"></span>9. Innocence, then, and knowledge make
a man blessed. We have also noted already that the blessedness of
eternal life is the reward for good works. It remains, then, to show
that when the patronage of pleasure or the fear of pain is despised (and
the first of these one abhors as poor and effeminate, and the other as
unmanly and weak), that then a blessed life can rise up in the midst of
pain. This can easily be shown when we read: “Blessed are ye when men
shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil
against you for righteousness’ sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for
great is your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets
which were before you.” <span id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389) And
again: “He that will come after Me, let him take up his cross and follow
Me.” <span id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390)

lessened or added to by external matters, is illustrated by the example
of men of old.](2100067)
