#### <span id="iv.i.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.i.ii.ix-p1"></span>A duty is to be chosen from what is
virtuous, and from what is useful, and also from the comparison of the
two, one with the other; but nothing is recognized by Christians as
virtuous or useful which is not helpful to the future life. This
treatise on duty, therefore, will not be superfluous.

<span id="iv.i.ii.ix-p2"></span>27. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.ix-p2.1"></span>The</span> philosophers considered that
duties <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61) were derived from what is
virtuous and what is useful, and that from these two one should choose
the better. Then, they say, it may happen that two virtuous or two
useful things will clash together, and the question is, which is the
more virtuous, and which the more useful? First, therefore, “duty” is
divided into three sections: what is virtuous, what is useful, and what
is the better of two. Then, again, these three are divided into five
classes; that is, two that are virtuous, two that are useful, and,
lastly, the right judgment as to the choice between them. The first they
say has to do with the moral dignity and integrity of life; the second
with the con<span id="page_6">p. 6</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.ix-Page_6"></span>veniences of life, with wealth, resources,
opportunities; whilst a right judgment must underlie the choice of any
of them. This is what the philosophers say. <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62)

<span id="iv.i.ii.ix-p5"></span>28. But we measure nothing at all but
that which is fitting and virtuous, and that by the rule of things
future rather than of things present; and we state nothing to be useful
but what will help us to the blessing of eternal life; certainly not
that which will help us enjoy merely the present time. Nor do we
recognize any advantages in opportunities and in the wealth of earthly
goods, but consider them as disadvantages if not put aside, and to be
looked on as a burden, when we have them, rather than as a loss when
expended.

<span id="iv.i.ii.ix-p6"></span>29. This work of ours, therefore, is not
superfluous, seeing that we and they regard duty in quite different
ways. They reckon the advantages of this life among the good things, we
reckon them among the evil things; for he who receives good things here,
as the rich man in the parable, is tormented there; and Lazarus, who
endured evil things here, there found comfort. <span
id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63) Lastly, those who do not read their
writings may read ours if they will—if, that is, they do not require
great adornment of language or a skilfully-treated subject, but are
satisfied with the simple charm of the subject itself.

[Next: Chapter X. What is seemly is often found in the sacred writings
long before it appears in the books of the philosophers. Pythagoras
borrowed the law of his silence from David. David's rule, however, is
the best, for our first duty is to have due measure in
speaking.](2100022)
