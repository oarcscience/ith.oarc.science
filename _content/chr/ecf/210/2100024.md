#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xii-p1"></span>To prevent any one from being checked
in the exercise of mercy, he shows that God cares for human actions; and
proves on the evidence of Job that all wicked men are unhappy in the
very abundance of their wealth.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xii-p2"></span>40. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xii-p2.1"></span>But</span> many are kept back from the duty
of showing active mercy, because they suppose that God does not care
about the actions of men, or that He does not know what we do in secret,
and what our conscience has in view. Some again think that His judgment
<span id="page_8">p. 8</span> <span id="iv.i.ii.xii-Page_8"></span>in no
wise seems to be just; for they see that sinners have abundance of
riches, that they enjoy honours, health, and children; while, on the
other hand, the just live in poverty and unhonoured, they are without
children, sickly in body, and often in grief.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xii-p3"></span>41. That is no small point. For those
three royal friends of Job declared him to be a sinner, because they saw
that he, after being rich, became poor; that after having many children,
he had lost them all, and that he was now covered with sores and was
full of weals, and was a mass of wounds from head to foot. But holy Job
made this declaration to them: “If I suffer thus because of my sins, why
do the wicked live? They grow old also in riches, their seed is
according to their pleasure, their children are before their eyes, their
houses are prosperous; but they have no fear; there is no scourge from
the Lord on them.” <span id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xii-p5"></span>42. A faint-hearted man, seeing this,
is disturbed in mind, and turns his attention away from it. Holy Job,
when about to speak in the words of such a one, began thus, saying:
“Bear with me, I also will speak; then laugh at me. For if I am found
fault with, I am found fault with as a man. Bear, therefore, the burden
of my words.” <span id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77) For I am going to say
(he means) what I do not approve; but I shall utter wrong words to
refute you. Or, to translate it in another way: “How now? Am I found
fault with by a man?” That is: a man cannot find fault with me because I
have sinned, although I deserve to be found fault with; for ye do not
find fault with me on the ground of an open sin, but estimate what I
deserve for my offences by the extent of my misfortunes. Thus the
faint-hearted man, seeing that the wicked succeed and prosper, whilst he
himself is crushed by misfortune, says to the Lord: “Depart from me, I
desire not the knowledge of Thy ways. <span
id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78) What good is it that we serve Him, or
what use to hasten to Him? In the hands of the wicked are all good
things, but He sees not their works.”

<span id="iv.i.ii.xii-p8"></span>43. Plato has been greatly praised,
because in his book “on the State,” <span id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79)
he has made the person who undertook the part of objector against
justice to ask pardon for his words, of which he himself did not
approve; and to say that that character was only assumed for the sake of
finding out the truth and to investigate the question at issue. And
Cicero so far approved of this, that he also, in his book which he wrote
“on the Commonwealth,” thought something must be said against that idea.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xii-p10"></span>44. How many years before these did
Job live! He was the first to discover this, and to consider what
excuses had to be made for this, not for the sake of decking out his
eloquence, but for the sake of finding out the truth. At once he made
the matter plain, stating that the lamp of the wicked is put out, that
their destruction will come; <span id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80) that
God, the teacher of wisdom and instruction, is not deceived, but is a
judge of the truth. Therefore the blessedness of individuals must not be
estimated at the value of their known wealth, but according to the voice
of their conscience within them. For this, as a true and uncorrupted
judge of punishments and rewards, decides between the deserts of the
innocent and the guilty. The innocent man dies in the strength of his
own simplicity, in the full possession of his own will; having a soul
filled as it were with marrow. <span id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81) But
the sinner, though he has abundance in life, and lives in the midst of
luxury, and is redolent with sweet scents, ends his life in the
bitterness of his soul, and brings his last day to a close, taking with
him none of those good things which he once enjoyed—carrying away
nothing with him but the price of his own wickedness. <span
id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xii-p14"></span>45. In thinking of this, deny if thou
canst that a recompense is paid by divine judgment. The former feels
happy in his heart, the latter wretched; that man on his own verdict is
guiltless, this one a criminal; that man again is happy in leaving the
world, this man grieves over it. Who can be pronounced guiltless that is
not innocent in the sight of his own conscience? “Tell me,” he says,
“where is the covering of his tabernacle; his token will not be
found.” <span id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83) The life of the criminal is
as a dream. He has opened his eyes. His repose has departed, his
enjoyment has fled. Nay, that very repose of the wicked, which even
while they live is only seeming, is now in hell, for alive they go down
into hell.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xii-p16"></span>46. Thou seest the enjoyments of the
sinner; but question his conscience. Will he not be more foul than any
sepulchre? Thou beholdest his joy, thou admirest the bodily health of
his children, and the amount of his wealth; but look within at the sores
and wounds of his soul, the sadness of his heart. And what shall I say
of his wealth, when <span id="page_9">p. 9</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.xii-Page_9"></span>thou readest: “For a man’s life
consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he
possesseth”? <span id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84) When thou knowest,
that though he seems to thee to be rich, to himself he is poor, and in
his own person refutes thy judgment? What also shall I say of the number
of his children and of his freedom from pain—when he is full of grief
and decides that he will have no heir, and does not wish that those who
copy his ways should succeed him? For the sinner really leaves no heir.
Thus the wicked man is a punishment to himself, but the upright man is a
grace to himself—and to either, whether good or bad, the reward of his
deeds is paid in his own person.
