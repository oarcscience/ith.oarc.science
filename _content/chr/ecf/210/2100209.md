<span id="iv.iv.iv.v"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.v-p1"></span>The omnipotence of the Son of God,
demonstrated on the authority of the Old and the New Testament.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.v-p2"></span>34. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.v-p2.1"></span>Seeing</span>, then, that the Son of God is
true and good, surely He is Almighty God. Can there be yet any doubt on
this point? We have already cited the place where it is read that “the
Lord Almighty is His Name.” <span id="fr_1941"></span>[1942](#fn_1941)
Because, then, the Son is Lord, and the Lord is Almighty, the Son of God
is Almighty.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.v-p4"></span>35. But hear also such a passage as you
<span id="page_228">p. 228</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iv.v-Page_228"></span>can build no doubts upon: <span
id="fr_1942"></span>[1943](#fn_1942) “Behold, He cometh,” saith the
Scripture, “with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him, and they which
pierced Him, and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn because of Him.
Yea, amen. I am Alpha and Omega, saith the Lord God, Who is, and Who
was, and Who is to come, the Almighty.” <span
id="fr_1943"></span>[1944](#fn_1943) Whom, I ask, did they pierce? For
Whose coming hope we but the Son’s? Therefore, Christ is Almighty Lord,
and God.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.v-p7"></span>36. Hear another passage, your sacred
Majesty,—hear the voice of Christ. “Thus saith the Lord Almighty: After
His glory <span id="fr_1944"></span>[1945](#fn_1944) hath He sent me
against the nations which have made spoil of you, forasmuch as he that
toucheth you is as he that toucheth the pupil of His eye. For lo, I lay
my hand upon them which despoiled you, and I will save you, and they
shall be for a spoil, which made spoil of you, and they shall know that
the Lord Almighty hath sent Me.” Plainly, He Who speaks is the Lord
Almighty, and He Who hath sent is the Lord Almighty. By consequence,
then, almighty power appertains both to the Father and to the Son;
nevertheless, it is One Almighty God, for there is oneness of Majesty.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.v-p9"></span>37. Moreover, that your most excellent
Majesty may know that it is Christ which hath spoken as in the Gospel,
so also in the prophet, He saith by the mouth of Isaiah, as though
foreordaining the Gospel: “I Myself, Who spake, am come,” <span
id="fr_1945"></span>[1946](#fn_1945) that is to say, I, Who spake in the
Law, am present in the Gospel.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.v-p11"></span>38. Elsewhere, again, He saith: “All
things that the Father hath are Mine.” <span
id="fr_1946"></span>[1947](#fn_1946) What meaneth He by “all things”?
Clearly, not things created, for all these were made by the Son, but the
things that the Father hath—that is to say, Eternity, Sovereignty,
Godhead, which are His possession, as begotten of the Father. We cannot,
then, doubt that He is Almighty, Who hath all things that the Father
hath (for it is written: “All things that the Father hath are Mine”).

[Next: Chapter V. Certain passages from Scripture, urged against the
Omnipotence of Christ, are resolved; the writer is also at especial
pains to show that Christ not seldom spoke in accordance with the
affections of human nature.](2100210)
