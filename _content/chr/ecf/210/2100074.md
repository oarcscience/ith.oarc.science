<span id="iv.i.iii.xi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.iii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xi-p1"></span>A third element which tends to gain any
one’s confidence is shown to have been conspicuous in Moses, Daniel, and
Joseph.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xi-p2"></span>56. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xi-p2.1"></span>But</span> a third point seems also to have
been noted in the case of those who were thought worthy of
admiration <span id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466) after the example of
Joseph, Solomon, and Daniel. For what shall I say of Moses whose advice
all Israel always waited for, <span id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467)
whose life caused them to trust in his prudence and increased their
esteem for him? Who would not trust to the counsel of Moses, to whom the
elders reserved for decision whatever they thought beyond their
understanding and powers?

<span id="iv.i.iii.xi-p5"></span>57. Who would refuse the counsel of
Daniel, of whom God Himself said: “Who is wiser than Daniel?” <span
id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468) How can men doubt about the minds of
those to whom God has given such grace? By the counsel of Moses wars
were brought to an end, and for his merit’s sake food came from heaven
and drink from the rock.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xi-p7"></span>58. How pure must have been the soul of
Daniel to soften the character of barbarians and to tame the
lions! <span id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469) What temperance was his,
what self-restraint in soul and body! Not unworthily did he become an
object of admiration to all, when—and all men do admire this,—though
enjoying royal friendships, he sought not for gold, nor counted the
honour given him as more precious than his faith. For he was willing to
endure danger for the law of God rather than to be turned from his
purpose in order to gain the favour of men.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xi-p9"></span>59. And what, again, shall I say of the
chastity and justice of Joseph, whom I had almost passed by, whereby on
the one hand he rejected the allurements of his mistress and refused
rewards, on the other he mocked at death, repressed his fear, and chose
a prison? Who would not consider him a fit person to give advice in a
private case, whose fruitful spirit and fertile mind enriched the
barrenness of the time with the wealth of his counsels and heart? <span

from one who is morose or impracticable, but rather from one of whom we
have a pattern in the Scriptures.](2100075)
