### <span id="iv.viii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p1"></span>The precepts of the Apostle concerning
a widow indeed are laid down, such as, that she bring up children,
attend to her parents, desire to please God, show herself
irreproachable, set forth a ripeness of merits, have been the wife of
one man. St. Ambrose notes, however, that a second marriage was not
condemned by St. Paul, and adds that widows must have a good report for
virtue with all. The reasons why younger widows are to be avoided, and
what is meant by its being better to marry than to burn. St. Ambrose
then goes on to speak of the dignity of widows, shown by the fact that
any injury done to them is visited by the anger of God.

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p2"></span>7. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.viii.iii-p2.1"></span>So</span>, then, a widow is not only marked
off by bodily abstinence, but is distinguished by virtue, to whom I do
not give commandments, but the Apostle. I am not the only person to do
them honour, but the Doctor of the Gentiles did so first, when he said:
“Honour widows that are widows indeed. But if any widow have children or
nephews, let her first learn to govern her own house, and to requite her
parents.” <span id="fr_3308"></span>[3309](#fn_3308) Whence we observe
that each inclination of affection ought to exist in a widow, to love
her children and to do her duty to her parents. So when discharging her
duty to her parents she is teaching her children, and is rewarded
herself by her own compliance with duty, in that what she performs for
others benefits herself.

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p4"></span>8. “For this,” says he, “is acceptable
with God.” <span id="fr_3309"></span>[3310](#fn_3309) So that if thou, O
widow, carest for the things of God, thou oughtest to follow after that
which thou hast learnt to be well pleasing to God. And, indeed, the
Apostle somewhat farther back, <span
id="fr_3310"></span>[3311](#fn_3310) exhorting widows to the pursuit of
continence, said that they mind the things of the Lord. But elsewhere,
when a widow who is approved is to be selected, she is bidden not only
to bear in mind but also to hope in the Lord: “For she that is a widow
indeed,” it is said, “and desolate, must hope in God, and be instant in
supplications and prayers night and day.” <span
id="fr_3311"></span>[3312](#fn_3311) And not without reason does he show
that these ought to be blameless, to whom, as virtuous works are
enjoined, so, too, great respect is paid, so that they are honoured even
by bishops.

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p8"></span>9. And of what kind she ought to be who
is chosen the description is given in the words of the teacher himself:
“Not less than threescore years old, having been the wife of one
man.” <span id="fr_3312"></span>[3313](#fn_3312) Not that old age alone
makes the widow, <span id="fr_3313"></span>[3314](#fn_3313) but that the
merits of the widow are the duties of old age. For she certainly is the
more noble who represses the heat of youth, and the impetuous ardour of
youthful age, desiring neither the tenderness of a husband, nor the
abundant delights of children, rather than one who, now worn out in
body, cold in age, of ripe years, can neither grow warm with pleasures,
nor hope for offspring.

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p11"></span>10. Nor in truth is any one excluded
from the devotion of widowhood, if after entering upon a second
marriage, which the precepts of the Apostle certainly do not condemn as
<span id="page_393">p. 393</span> <span
id="iv.viii.iii-Page_393"></span>though the fruit of chastity were lost,
if she be again loosed from her husband. She will have, indeed, the
merit of her chastity, even if it be tardy, but she will be more
approved who has tried a second marriage, for the desire of chastity is
conspicuous in her, for the other old age or shame seems to have put an
end to marrying.

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p12"></span>11. Nor yet is bodily chastity alone
the strong purpose of the widow, but a large and most abundant exercise
of virtue. “Well reported of for good works, if she have brought up
children; if she have lodged strangers; if she have washed the saints’
feet; if she have ministered to those suffering tribulation; if, lastly,
she have followed after every good work.” <span
id="fr_3314"></span>[3315](#fn_3314) You see how many practices of
virtue he has included. He demands, first of all, the duty of piety;
secondly, the practice of hospitality and humble service; thirdly, the
ministry of mercy and liberality in assisting; and, lastly, the
performance of every good work.

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p14"></span>12. And he, therefore, that the
younger should be avoided, <span id="fr_3315"></span>[3316](#fn_3315)
because they are not able to fulfil the requirements of so high a degree
of virtue. For youth is prone to fall because the heat of various
desires is inflamed by the warmth of glowing youth, and it is the part
of a good doctor to keep off the materials of sin. For the first
exercise in training the soul is to turn away sin, the second to implant
virtue. Yet, since the Apostle knew that Anna, the widow of fourscore
years, from her youth was a herald of the works of the Lord, I do not
think that he thought that the younger should be excluded from the
devotion of widowhood, especially as he said: “It is better to marry
than to burn.” <span id="fr_3316"></span>[3317](#fn_3316) For certainly
he recommended marriage as a remedy, that she who would else perish
might be saved; he did not prescribe the choice that one who could
contain should not follow chastity, for it is one thing to succour one
who is falling, another to persuade to virtue.

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p17"></span>13. And what shall I say of human
judgments, since in the judgments of God the Jews are set forth as
having offended the Lord in nothing more than violating what was due to
the widow and the rights of minors? This is proclaimed by the voices of
the prophets as the cause which brought upon the Jews the penalty of
rejection. This is mentioned as the only cause which will mitigate the
wrath of God against their sin, if they honour the widow, and execute
true judgment for minors, for thus we read: “Judge the fatherless, deal
justly with the widow, and come let us reason together, saith the
Lord.” <span id="fr_3317"></span>[3318](#fn_3317) And elsewhere: “The
Lord shall maintain the orphan and the widow.” <span
id="fr_3318"></span>[3319](#fn_3318) And again: “I will abundantly bless
her widow.” <span id="fr_3319"></span>[3320](#fn_3319) Wherein also the
likeness of the Church is foreshadowed. You see, then, holy widows, that
that office which is honoured by the assistance of divine grace must not
be degraded by impure desire.

[Next: Chapter III. St. Ambrose returns to the story of the widow of
Sarepta, and shows that she represented the Church, hence that she was
an example to virgins, married women, and widows. Then he refers to the
prophet as setting forth Christ, inasmuch as he foretold the mysteries
and the rain which was to come. Next he touches upon and explains the
twofold sign of Gideon, and points out that it is not in every one's
power to work miracles, and that the Incarnation of Christ and the
rejection of the Jews were foreshadowed in that account.](2100352)
