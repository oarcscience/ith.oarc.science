#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.viii-p1"></span>The likeness of Christ to the Father
is asserted on the authority of St. Paul, the prophets, and the Gospel,
and especially in reliance upon the creation of man in God’s image.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.viii-p2"></span>48. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.viii-p2.1"></span>The</span> Apostle saith that Christ is
the image of the Father—for he calls Him the image of the invisible God,
the first-begotten of all creation. First-begotten, mark you, not
first-created, in order that He may be believed to be both begotten, in
virtue of His nature, <span id="fr_1760"></span>[1761](#fn_1760) and
first in virtue of His eternity. In another place also the Apostle has
declared that God made the Son “heir of all things, by Whom also He made
the worlds, Who is the brightness of His glory, and the express image of
His substance.” <span id="fr_1761"></span>[1762](#fn_1761) The Apostle
calls Christ the image of the Father, and Arius says that He is unlike
the Father. Why, then, is He called an image, if He hath no likeness?
Men will not have their portraits unlike them, and Arius contends that
the Father is unlike the Son, and would have it that the Father has
begotten one unlike Himself, as though unable to generate His like.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.viii-p5"></span>49. The prophets say: “In Thy light
we shall see light;” <span id="fr_1762"></span>[1763](#fn_1762) and
again: “Wisdom is the brightness of everlasting light, and the spotless
mirror of God’s majesty, the image of His goodness.” <span
id="fr_1763"></span>[1764](#fn_1763) See what great names are declared!
“Brightness,” because in the Son the Father’s glory shines clearly:
“spotless mirror,” because the Father is seen in the Son: <span
id="fr_1764"></span>[1765](#fn_1764) “image of goodness,” because it is
not one body seen reflected in another, but the whole power \[of the
Godhead\] in the Son. The word “image” teaches us that there is no
difference; “expression,” that He is the counterpart of the Father’s
form; and “brightness” declares His eternity. <span
id="fr_1765"></span>[1766](#fn_1765) The “image” in truth is not that of
a bodily countenance, not one made up of colours, nor modelled in wax,
but simply derived from God, coming out from the Father, drawn from the
fountainhead.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.viii-p10"></span>50. By means of this image the Lord
showed Philip the Father, saying, “Philip, he that sees Me, sees the
Father also. How then dost thou say, Show us the Father? Believest thou
not that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me?” <span
id="fr_1766"></span>[1767](#fn_1766) Yes, he who looks upon the Son
sees, in portrait, the Father. <span
id="fr_1767"></span>[1768](#fn_1767) Mark what manner of portrait is
spoken of. It is Truth, Righteousness, the Power of God: <span
id="fr_1768"></span>[1769](#fn_1768) not dumb, for it is the Word; not
insensible, for it is Wisdom; not vain and foolish, for it is Power; not
soulless, for it is the Life; not dead, for it is the
Resurrection. <span id="fr_1769"></span>[1770](#fn_1769) <span
id="page_209">p. 209</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iii.viii-Page_209"></span>You see, then, that whilst an image
is spoken of, the meaning is that it is the Father, Whose image the Son
is, seeing that no one can be his own image.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.viii-p15"></span>51. More might I set down from the
Son’s testimony; howbeit, lest He perchance appear to have asserted
Himself overmuch, let us enquire of the Father. For the Father said,
“Let us make man in Our image and likeness.” <span
id="fr_1770"></span>[1771](#fn_1770) The Father saith to the Son “in
*Our* image and likeness,” and thou sayest that the Son of God is unlike
the Father.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.viii-p17"></span>52. John saith, “Beloved, we are
sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: we know that
if He be revealed, we shall be like Him.” <span
id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771) O blind madness! O shameless
obstinacy! We are men, and, so far as we may, we shall be in the
likeness of God: dare we deny that the Son is like God?

<span id="iv.iv.iii.viii-p19"></span>53. Therefore the Father hath said:
“Let us make man in Our image and likeness.” At the beginning of the
universe itself, as I read, the Father and the Son existed, and I see
one creation. I hear Him that speaketh. <span
id="fr_1772"></span>[1773](#fn_1772) I acknowledge Him that doeth: <span
id="fr_1773"></span>[1774](#fn_1773) but it is of one image, one
likeness, that I read. This likeness belongs not to diversity but to
unity. What, therefore, thou claimest for thyself, thou takest from the
Son of God, seeing, indeed, that thou canst not be in the image of God,
save by help of the image of God.

[Next: Chapter VIII. The likeness of the Son to the Father being proved,
it is not hard to prove the Son's eternity, though, indeed, this may be
established on the authority of the Prophet Isaiah and St. John the
Evangelist, by which authority the heretical leaders are shown to be
refuted.](2100191)
