### <span id="iv.iv.ii-p0.1"></span>Prefatory Note.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>The</span> notes to the first four books of
the *De Fide* have in some instances been taken over from those in
Father Hurter’s Edition of the treatise (Innsbruck: Wagner), which has
been used in preparing the translation of these books. These notes are
distinguished by the letter "H." placed at the end.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p2"></span>The citations from Scripture embodied in
the text have been translated as they stood in the original. This will
account for any divergence from the renderings in the English Bible and
Prayer-book, whilst any agreement may be set down to reminiscences of
the more familiar versions. It was thought best to adopt this treatment
of St. Ambrose’s citations, inasmuch as the divergences are worth
noticing, and indeed, in some cases, the argument rather turns upon
them. The references are, throughout, made to chapters and verses in the
English Bible, and not to the Vulgate, unless especially stated so to
be.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p3"></span>The Prefaces and Summaries of Contents are
based on those in Father Hurter’s Edition.
