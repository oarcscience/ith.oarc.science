<p class="c32"><a name="iv.i.iii.xix-p1"></A>Many are won by justice and benevolence and courtesy, but all this must be sincere.</p>  
<p class="c22"><a name="iv.i.iii.xix-p2"></A>95. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.i.iii.xix-p2.1"></A>It</span> is plain, then, that equity strengthens empires, and injustice destroys them. How could wickedness hold fast a kingdom when it cannot even rule over a single family? There is need, therefore, of the greatest kindness, so that we may preserve not only the government of affairs in general, but also the rights of individuals.

 and let us show openly such feelings as we have within us. Let us not say an unjust word in our heart that we think can be hid in silence, for He hears things said in secret Who made things secret, and knows the secrets of the heart, and has implanted feelings within. Therefore as though under the eyes of the Judge let us consider all we do as set forth in the light, that it may be manifest to all.</p>
