#### <span id="iv.i.iii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.i.iii.x-p1"></span>Men entrust their safety rather to a
just than to a prudent man. But every one is wont to seek out the man
who combines in himself the qualities of justice and prudence. Solomon
gives us an example of this. (The words which the queen of Sheba spoke
of him are explained.) Also Daniel and Joseph.

<span id="iv.i.iii.x-p2"></span>50. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.x-p2.1"></span>We</span> entrust our case to the most
prudent man we can find, and ask advice from him more readily than we do
from others. However, the faithful counsel of a just <span
id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455) man stands first and often has more
weight than the great abilities of the wisest of men: “For better are
the wounds of a friend than the kisses of others.” <span
id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456) And just because it is the judgment of
a just man, it is also the conclusion of a wise one: in the one lies the
result of the matter in dispute, in the other readiness of invention.

<span id="iv.i.iii.x-p5"></span>51. And if one connects the two, there
will be great soundness in the advice given, which is regarded by all
with admiration for the wisdom shown, and with love for its justice. And
so all will desire to hear the wisdom of that man in whom those two
virtues are found together, as all the kings of the earth desired to see
the face of Solomon and to hear his wisdom. Nay, even the queen of Sheba
came to him and tried him with questions. She came and spoke of all the
things that were in her heart, and heard all the wisdom of Solomon, nor
did any word escape her. <span id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457)

<span id="iv.i.iii.x-p7"></span>52. Who she was whom nothing escaped,
and that there was nothing which the truth-loving Solomon did not tell
her, learn, O man, from this which thou hearest her saying: “It was a
true report that I heard in <span id="page_52">p. 52</span> <span
id="iv.i.iii.x-Page_52"></span>mine own land of thy words and of thy
prudence, yet I did not believe those that told it me until I came, and
mine eyes had seen it; and behold the half was not told me. Thou hast
added good things over and above all that I heard in mine own land.
Blessed are thy women and blessed thy servants, which stand before thee,
and that hear all thy prudence.” <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458)
Recognize the feast of the true Solomon, and who are set down at that
feast; recognize it wisely and think in what land all the nations shall
hear the fame of true wisdom and justice, and with what eyes they shall
see Him, beholding those things which are not seen. “For the things that
are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are
eternal.” <span id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459)

<span id="iv.i.iii.x-p10"></span>53. What women are blessed but those of
whom it is said “that many hear the word of God and bring forth
fruit”? <span id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460) And again: “Whosoever
doeth the word of God is My father and sister and mother.” <span
id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461) And who are those blessed servants,
who stand before Him, but Paul, who said: “Even to this day I stand
witnessing both to great and small;” <span
id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462) or Simeon, who was waiting in the
temple to see the consolation of Israel? <span
id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463) How could he have asked to be let
depart, except that in standing before the Lord he had not the power of
departing, but only according to the will of God? Solomon is put before
us simply for the sake of example, of whom it was eagerly expected that
his wisdom should be heard.

<span id="iv.i.iii.x-p15"></span>54. Joseph also when in prison was not
free from being consulted about matters of uncertainty. His
counsel <span id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464) was of advantage to the
whole of Egypt, so that it felt not the seven years’ famine, and he was
able even to relieve other peoples from their dreadful hunger.

<span id="iv.i.iii.x-p17"></span>55. Daniel, though one of the captives,
was made the head of the royal counsellors. By his counsels he improved
the present and foretold the future. <span
id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465) Confidence was put in him in all
things, because he had frequently interpreted things, and had shown that
he had declared the truth.
