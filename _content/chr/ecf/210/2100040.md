#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxviii-p1"></span>A community rests upon justice and
good-will. Two parts of the former, revenge and private possession, are
not recognized by Christians. What the Stoics say about common property
and mutual help has been borrowed from the sacred writings. The
greatness of the glory of justice, and what hinders access to it.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxviii-p2"></span>130. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxviii-p2.1"></span>Justice</span>, <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190) then, has to do with the society of
the human race, and the community at large. For that which holds society
together is divided into two parts,—justice and good-will, which also is
called liberality and kindness. Justice seems to me the loftier,
liberality the more pleasing, of the two. The one gives judgment, the
other shows goodness.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxviii-p4"></span>131. But that very thing is excluded
with us which philosophers think to be the office of justice. For they
say that the first expression of justice is, to hurt no one, except
<span id="page_23">p. 23</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.xxviii-Page_23"></span>when driven to it by wrongs received.
This is put aside by the authority of the Gospel. For the Scripture
wills that the Spirit of the Son of Man should be in us, Who came to
give grace, not to bring harm. <span id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxviii-p6"></span>132. Next they considered it
consonant with justice that one should treat common, that is, public
property as public, and private as private. But this is not even in
accord with nature, for nature has poured forth all things for all men
for common use. God has ordered all things to be produced, so that there
should be food in common to all, and that the earth should be a common
possession for all. Nature, therefore, has produced a common right for
all, but greed has made it a right for a few. Here, too, we are told
that the Stoics taught that all things which are produced on the earth
are created for the use of men, but that men are born for the sake of
men, so that mutually one may be of advantage to another. <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxviii-p8"></span>133. But whence have they got such
ideas but out of the holy Scriptures? For Moses wrote that God said:
“Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and
over the cattle, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
earth.” <span id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193) And David said: “Thou
hast put all things under his feet; all sheep and oxen, yea, and the
beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the
sea.” <span id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194) So these philosophers have
learnt from our writings that all things were made subject to man, and,
therefore, they think that all things were produced also for man’s sake.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxviii-p11"></span>134. That man was made for the sake
of man we find stated also in the books of Moses, when the Lord says:
“It is not good that man should be alone, let us make him an helpmeet
for him.” <span id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195) Thus the woman was
given to the man to help him. She should bear him children, that one man
might always be a help to another. Again, before the woman was formed,
it was said of Adam: “There was not found an help-meet for him.” <span
id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196) For one man could not have proper help
but from another. Amongst all the living creatures, therefore, there was
none meet for him, or, to put it plainly, none to be his helper. Hence a
woman was looked for to help him.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxviii-p14"></span>135. Thus, in accordance with the
will of God and the union of nature, we ought to be of mutual help one
to the other, and to vie with each other in doing duties, to lay all our
advantages as it were before all, and (to use the words of Scripture) to
bring help one to the other from a feeling of devotion or of duty, by
giving money, or by doing something, at any rate in some way or other;
so that the charm of human fellowship may ever grow sweeter amongst us,
and none may ever be recalled from their duty by the fear of danger, but
rather account all things, whether good or evil, as their own
concern. <span id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197) Thus holy Moses feared
not to undertake terrible wars for his people’s sake, nor was he afraid
of the arms of the mightiest kings, nor yet was he frightened at the
savagery of barbarian nations. He put on one side the thought of his own
safety so as to give freedom to the people.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxviii-p16"></span>136. Great, then, is the glory of
justice; for she, existing rather for the good of others than of self,
is an aid to the bonds of union and fellowship amongst us. She holds so
high a place that she has all things laid under her authority, and
further can bring help to others and supply money; nor does she refuse
her services, but even undergoes dangers for others.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxviii-p17"></span>137. Who would not gladly climb and
hold the heights of this virtue, were it not that greed weakens and
lessens the power of such a virtue? <span
id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198) For as long as we want to add to our
possessions and to heap up money, to take into our possession fresh
lands, and to be the richest of all, we have cast aside the form of
justice and have lost the blessing of kindness towards all. How can he
be just that tries to take from another what he wants for himself?

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxviii-p19"></span>138. The desire to gain power also
enervates <span id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199) the perfect strength
and beauty of justice. For how can he, who attempts to bring others
under his own power, come forward on behalf of others? And how can a man
help the weak against the strong, when he himself aspires to great power
at the cost of liberty?

[Next: Chapter XXIX. Justice should be observed even in war and with
enemies. This is proved by the example of Moses and Elisha. The ancient
writers learnt in turn from the Hebrews to call their enemies by a
gentler term. Lastly, the foundation of justice rests on faith, and its
symmetry is perfect in the Church.](2100041)
