#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xxxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxiv-p1"></span>Some other advantages of goodwill are
here enumerated.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxiv-p2"></span>173. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxxiv-p2.1"></span>Good-will</span> also is wont to remove
the sword of anger. It is also good-will that makes the wounds of a
friend to be better than the willing kisses of an enemy. <span
id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257) Goodwill again makes many to become
one. For if many are friends, they become one; in whom there is but one
spirit and one opinion. <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258) We note,
too, that in friendship corrections are pleasing. They have their sting,
but they cause no pain. We are pierced by the words of blame, but are
delighted with the anxiety that good-will shows.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxiv-p5"></span>174. To conclude, the same duties are
not owed to all. Nor is regard ever paid to persons, though the occasion
and the circumstances of the case are generally taken into
consideration, so that one may at times have to help a neighbour rather
than one’s brother. For Solomon also says: “Better is a neighbour that
is near than a brother far <span id="page_30">p. 30</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.xxxiv-Page_30"></span>off.” <span
id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259) For this reason a man generally trusts
himself to the good-will of a friend rather than to the ties of
relationship with his brother. So far does good-will prevail that it
often goes beyond the pledges given by nature.

[Next: Chapter XXXV. On fortitude. This is divided into two parts: as it
concerns matters of war and matters at home. The first cannot be a
virtue unless combined with justice and prudence. The other depends to a
large extent upon endurance.](2100047)
