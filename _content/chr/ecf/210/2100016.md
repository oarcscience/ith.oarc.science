#### <span id="iv.i.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.i.ii.iv-p1"></span>The same care must be taken that our
speech proceed not from evil passions, but from good motives; for here
it is that the devil is especially on the watch to catch us.

<span id="iv.i.ii.iv-p2"></span>14. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>If</span> any one takes heed to this, he
will be mild, gentle, modest. For in guarding his mouth, and restraining
his tongue, and in not speaking before examining, pondering, and
weighing his words—as to whether this should be said, that should be
answered, or whether it be a suitable time for this remark—he certainly
is practising modesty, gentleness, patience. So he will not burst out
into speech through displeasure or anger, nor give sign of any passion
in his words, nor proclaim that the flames of lust are burning in his
language, or that the incentives of wrath are present in what he says.
Let him act thus for fear that his words, which ought to grace his inner
life, should at the last plainly show and prove that there is some vice
in his morals.

<span id="iv.i.ii.iv-p3"></span>15. For then especially does the enemy
lay his plans, when he sees passions engendered in us; then he supplies
tinder; then he lays snares. Wherefore the prophet says not without
cause, as we heard read to-day: “Surely He hath delivered me from the
snare of the hunter and from the hard word.” <span
id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51) Symmachus <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52) said this means “the word of
provocation;” others “the word that brings disquiet.” The snare of the
enemy is our speech—but that itself is also just as much an enemy to us.
Too often we say something that our foe takes hold of, and whereby he
wounds us as though by our own sword. How far better it is to perish by
the sword of others than by our own!

<span id="iv.i.ii.iv-p6"></span>16. Accordingly the enemy tests our arms
and clashes together his weapons. If he sees that I am disturbed, he
implants the points of his darts, so as to raise a crop of quarrels. If
I utter an unseemly word, he sets his snare. Then he puts before me the
opportunity for revenge as a bait, so that in desiring to be revenged, I
may put myself in the snare, and draw the death-knot tight for myself.
If any one feels this enemy is <span id="page_4">p. 4</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.iv-Page_4"></span>near, he ought to give greater heed to his
mouth, lest he make room for the enemy; but not many see him.

<span id="iv.i.ii.iv-p5"></span> Symmachus, said to have been an
Ebionite, lived c. 193–211. He translated the Old Testament into Greek.
This was one of the versions Origen made use of in his Hexapla edition
of the Bible.

[Next: Chapter V. We must guard also against a visible enemy when he
incites us by silence; by the help of which alone we can escape from
those greater than ourselves, and maintain that humility which we must
display towards all.](2100017)
