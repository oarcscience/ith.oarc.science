### <span id="iv.i.iv-p0.1"></span>Book III.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Next: Chapter I. We are taught by David and Solomon how to take counsel
with our own heart. Scipio is not to be accounted prime author of the
saying which is ascribed to him. The writer proves what glorious things
the holy prophets accomplished in their time of quiet, and shows, by
examples of their and others' leisure moments, that a just man is never
alone in trouble.](2100095)
