<p> <a name="iv.ii.iv.ii"></A> <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.ii.iv.ii-p0.1"></A>Chapter II.</h4>  
<p class="c32"><a name="iv.ii.iv.ii-p1"></A>The Son and the Spirit are alike given; whence not subjection but one Godhead is shown by Its working.</p>  
<p class="c22"><a name="iv.ii.iv.ii-p2"></A>9. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ii.iv.ii-p2.1"></A>And</span> not only did the Father send the Son, but also gave Him, as the Son Himself gave Himself. For we read: &#8220;Grace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, Who gave Himself for our sins.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1241"></A><A HREF="#fn_1241"><FONT SIZE="1">1242</FONT></A>
 If they think that He was subject in that He was sent, they cannot deny that it was of grace that He was given. But He was given by the Father, as Isaiah said: &#8220;Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1242"></A><A HREF="#fn_1242"><FONT SIZE="1">1243</FONT></A>
 but He was given, I dare to say it, by the Spirit also, Who was sent by the Spirit. For since the prophet has not defined by whom  <A NAME="page_137"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 137</FONT></A> <a name="iv.ii.iv.ii-Page_137"></A>He was given, he shows that He was given by the grace of the Trinity; and inasmuch as the Son Himself gave Himself, He could not be subject to Himself according to His Godhead. Therefore that He was given could not be a sign of subjection in the God-head.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.ii.iv.ii-p5"></A>10. But the Holy Spirit also was given, for it is written: &#8220;I will ask the Father, and He shall give you another Paraclete.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1243"></A><A HREF="#fn_1243"><FONT SIZE="1">1244</FONT></A>
 And the Apostle says: &#8220;Wherefore he that despiseth these things despiseth not man but God, Who hath given us His Holy Spirit.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1244"></A><A HREF="#fn_1244"><FONT SIZE="1">1245</FONT></A>
 Isaiah, too, shows that both the Spirit and the Son are given: &#8220;Thus,&#8221; says he, &#8220;saith the Lord God, Who made the heaven and fashioned it, Who stablished the earth, and the things which are in it, and giveth breath to the people upon it, and the Spirit to them that walk upon it.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1245"></A><A HREF="#fn_1245"><FONT SIZE="1">1246</FONT></A>
 And to the Son: &#8220;I am the Lord God, Who have called Thee in righteousness, and will hold Thine hand, and will strengthen Thee; and I have given Thee for a covenant of My people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out of their fetters those that are bound.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1246"></A><A HREF="#fn_1246"><FONT SIZE="1">1247</FONT></A>
 Since, then, the Son is both sent and given, and the Spirit also is both sent and given, They have assuredly a oneness of Godhead Who have a oneness of action.</p>

<A HREF="2100155">Next: Chapter III. The same Unity may also be recognized from the fact that the Spirit is called Finger, and the Son Right Hand; for the understanding of divine things is assisted by the usage of human language. The tables of the law were written by this Finger, and they were afterwards broken, and the reason. Lastly, Christ wrote with the same Finger; yet we must not admit any inferiority in the Spirit from this bodily comparison.</A></CENTER>
