<span id="iv.i.iii.ii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.iii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.i.iii.ii-p1"></span>The different ideas of philosophers on
the subject of happiness. He proves, first, from the Gospel that it
rests on the knowledge of God and the pursuit of good works; next, that
it may not be thought that this idea was adopted from the philosophers,
he adds proofs from the witness of the prophets.

<span id="iv.i.iii.ii-p2"></span>4. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> philosophers have made a happy
life to depend, either (as Hieronymus <span
id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371) ) on freedom from pain, or (as
Herillus <span id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372) ) on knowledge. For
Herillus, hearing knowledge very highly praised by Aristotle <span
id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373) and Theophrastus, <span
id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374) made it alone to be the chief good,
when they really praised it as a good thing, not as the only good;
others, as Epicurus, <span id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375) have called
pleasure such; others, as Callipho, <span
id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376) and after him Diodorus, <span
id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377) understood it in such a way as to make
a virtuous life go in union, the one with pleasure, the other with
freedom from pain, since a happy life could not exist without it.
Zeno, <span id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378) the Stoic, thought the
highest and only good existed in a virtuous life. But Aristotle and
Theophrastus and the other Peripatetics maintained that a happy life
consisted in virtue, that is, in a virtuous life, but that its happiness
was made complete by the advantages of the body and other external good
things.

<span id="iv.i.iii.ii-p11"></span>5. But the sacred Scriptures say that
eternal life rests on a knowledge of divine things and on the fruit of
good works. The Gospel bears witness to both these statements. For the
Lord Jesus spoke thus of knowledge: “This is eternal life, to know Thee,
the only true God, and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent.” <span
id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379) About works He gives this answer:
“Every one that hath forsaken house, or brethren, or sisters, or father,
or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for My Name’s sake, shall
receive an hundred-fold, and shall inherit everlasting life.” <span
id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380)

<span id="iv.i.iii.ii-p14"></span>6. Let no one think that this was but
lately said, and that it was spoken of by the philosophers before it was
mentioned in the Gospel. For the philosophers, that is to say, Aristotle
and Theophrastus, as also Zeno and Hieronymus, certainly lived before
the time of the Gospel; but they came after the prophets. Let them
rather think how long before even the names of the philosophers were
heard of, both of these seem to have found open expression through the
mouth of the holy David; for it is written: “Blessed is the man whom
Thou instructest, O Lord, and teachest him out of Thy law.” <span
id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381) We find elsewhere also: “Blessed is
the man that feareth the Lord, he will rejoice greatly in His
commandments.” <span id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382) We have proved
our point as regards knowledge, the reward for which the prophet states
to be the fruit of eternity, adding that in the house of the man that
feareth the Lord, or is instructed in His law and rejoices greatly in
the divine commandments, “is glory and riches; and his justice abideth
for ever and ever.” <span id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383) He has
further also in the same psalm stated of good works, that they gain for
an upright man the gift of eternal life. He speaks thus: “Blessed is the
man that showeth pity and lendeth, he will guide his affairs with
discretion, surely he shall not be moved for ever, the righteous shall
be in everlasting remembrance.” <span id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384)
And further: “He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor, his justice
endureth for ever.” <span id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385)

<span id="iv.i.iii.ii-p20"></span>7. Faith, then, has \[the promise of\]
eternal life, for it is a good foundation. Good works, too, have the
same, for an upright man is tested by his words and acts. For <span
id="page_45">p. 45</span> <span id="iv.i.iii.ii-Page_45"></span>if a man
is always busy talking and yet is slow to act, he shows by his acts how
worthless his knowledge is: besides it is much worse to know what one
ought to do, and yet not to do what one has learnt should be done. On
the other hand, to be active in good works and unfaithful at heart is as
idle as though one wanted to raise a beautiful and lofty dome upon a bad
foundation. The higher one builds, the greater is the fall; for without
the protection of faith good works cannot stand. A treacherous anchorage
in a harbour perforates a ship, and a sandy bottom quickly gives way and
cannot bear the weight of the building placed upon it. There then will
be found the fulness of reward, where the virtues are perfect, and where
there is a reasonable agreement between words and acts.
