<p class="c12"><a name="iv-p3"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iv-p3.1"></A>The</span> present volume of St. Chrysostom on the Acts of the Apostles has been delayed for some time by the difficulty of fixing the Text. Some farther account of the grounds on which this has been done will be given in the Preface to Part II. (vid. <i>infra.</i>) It may suffice for the present to say, that these Homilies appear to have been less carefully reported than usual, and published without a revision by the Author. The printed text was formed for the most part (Erasmus&#146;s Latin Version entirely) from a manuscript, said to be of the tenth century, in which these Homilies are given in a very different form, evidently the work of a later hand, and intended to make them read more smoothly. The earlier text, shown to be such by internal evidence, and alone followed in the Catena and all other ancient extracts and compilations, is preserved in other <span class="c14"><a name="iv-p3.2"></A>mss.</span> and appears to have been in general disregarded by former editors, from its difficulty. The Translation was originally made from Savile&#146;s Text, by the Rev. J. <span class="c14"><a name="iv-p3.3"></A>Walker</span>, M.A. of Brasenose College, and the Rev. J. <span class="c14"><a name="iv-p3.4"></A>Sheppard</span>, M.A. of Oriel College, Oxford. The Editors are much indebted to the Rev. H. <span class="c14"><a name="iv-p3.5"></A>Browne</span>, M.A. of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, who has restored the Text and corrected the Translation accordingly, the difference being frequently so great as to require a passage to be translated anew. He has likewise undertaken to prepare the Greek Text for publication, and to supply the prefatory matter. Many passages will still be found imperfect and unsatisfactory, but it has been thought better to leave them evidently so, than to resort to uncertain conjectures. A few conjectural emendations, however, have been admitted into the Text, and many more suggested.</p>
