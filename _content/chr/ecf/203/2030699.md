<span id="vi.xi.iii.xv-p1"></span> 11. If, then, you really intend to do
an act of repentance for those evil speeches of yours, if you are not
merely mocking us by saying this, and if you are not in your heart such
a lover of strife and contention that you are willing even to defame
yourself on this sole condition that you may be able thereby to besmirch
another; if it is not in pretence but in good faith that you repent of
what you have said amiss, come and do penance for this great and foul
blasphemy; for it is indeed blasphemy against God. For if a man
oversteps the mark by speaking erroneously of mere creatures, this is
not such a very execrable crime, especially if he does it, as you say,
not with a set purpose of blasphemy, but in seeking to vindicate the
justice of God. But to lift up your mouth against the heaven is a grave
offence; to speak violence and blasphemy against the Most High is worthy
of death. Let us bestow our lamentations upon that which is hard to
cure; for what man is there who has the jaundice, <span
id="fr_2957"></span>[2958](#fn_2957) and is in danger both of looks and
life, who will complain loudly because of a little hangnail on his foot
or because a scratch made with his own finger which easily yields to
remedies, is not yet cured?
