<span id="vi.xiii.xxxvii-p1"></span> 36. “<span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xiii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>The Holy Church; The Forgiveness of Sin,
the Resurrection of This Flesh</span>.” It is not said, “*In* the holy
Church,” nor “*In* the forgiveness of sins,” nor “*In* the resurrection
of the flesh.” For if the preposition “in” had been added, it would have
had the same force as in the preceding articles. But now in those
clauses in which the faith concerning the Godhead is declared, we say
“*In* God the Father,” and “*In* Jesus Christ His Son,” and “*In* the
Holy Ghost,” but in the rest, where we speak not of the Godhead but of
creatures and mysteries, the preposition “*in* ” is not added. We do not
say “We believe *in* the holy Church,” but “We believe the holy Church,”
not as God, but as the Church gathered together to God: and we believe
that there is “forgiveness of sins;” we do not say “We believe *in* the
forgiveness of sins;” and we believe that there will be a “Resurrection
of the flesh;” we do not say “We believe *in* the resurrection of the
flesh.” By this monosyllabic preposition, therefore, the Creator is
distinguished from the creatures, and things divine are separated from
things human.

<span id="vi.xiii.xxxvii-p2"></span>This then is the Holy Ghost, who in
the Old Testament inspired the Law and the Prophets, in the New the
Gospels and the Epistles. Whence also the Apostle says, “All Scripture
given by inspiration of God is profitable for instruction.” <span
id="fr_3403"></span>[3404](#fn_3403) And therefore it seems proper in
this place to enumerate, as we have learnt from the tradition of the
Fathers, the books of the New and of the Old Testament, which, according
to the tradition of our forefathers, are believed to have been inspired
by the Holy Ghost, and have been handed down to the Churches of Christ.
