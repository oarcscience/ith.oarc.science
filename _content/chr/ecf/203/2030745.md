<span id="vi.xii.i.vii-p6"></span>They ply the arms of Ceres,”)

<span id="vi.xii.i.vii-p7"></span>that I have translated into the Latin
tongue the books of Origen <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii.i.vii-p7.1"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span>, which are pernicious
and repugnant to the faith of the Church. My answer to them is brief and
succinct: “Your letters, my brother Pammachius, and those of your
friends, have compelled me. You declared that these books had been
falsely translated by another, and that not a few things had been
inter<span id="page_486">p. 486</span> <span
id="vi.xii.i.vii-Page_486"></span>polated or added or altered. And, lest
your letters should fail to carry conviction, you sent a copy of this
translation, together with the Preface in which I was praised. As soon
as I had run my eye over these documents, I at once noticed that the
impious doctrine enunciated by Origen about the Father, the Son and the
Holy Spirit, to which the ears of Romans could not bear to listen, had
been changed by the translator so as to give a more orthodox meaning.
His other doctrines, on the fall of the angels, the lapse of human
souls, his prevarications about the resurrection, his ideas about the
world, or rather Epicurus’s middle-spaces, <span
id="fr_3011"></span>[3012](#fn_3011) on the restitution of all to a
state of equality, and others much worse than these, which it would take
too long to recount, I found that he had either translated as they stood
in the Greek, or had stated them in a stronger and exaggerated manner in
words taken from the books of Didymus, who is the most open champion of
Origen. The effect of all this is that the reader, finding that the book
expressed the catholic doctrine on the Trinity, would take in these
heretical views without warning.
