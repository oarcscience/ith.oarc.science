<span id="vi.xii.ii.iv-p1"></span> 3. I will touch upon the other
points, and set down the actual words of his letter:

<span id="vi.xii.ii.iv-p2"></span>“Although my faith was proved, at the
time of the persecution by the heretics, when I was living in the holy
church of Alexandria, by imprisonments and exiles, to which I was
subjected because of the faith.”

<span id="vi.xii.ii.iv-p3"></span>I only wonder that he did not
add <span id="fr_3084"></span>[3085](#fn_3084) “The prisoner of Jesus
Christ,” or “I was delivered from the jaw of the lion,” or “I fought
with beasts at Alexandria,” or “I have finished my course, I have kept
the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.”
What exiles, what imprisonments are these which he describes? I blush
for this open falsehood. As if imprisonment and exile would be inflicted
without judicial sentences! I should like to have a list of these
imprisonments and of the various provinces to which he tells us that he
was forced into exile. Next there appear to have been numerous
imprisonments and an infinite number of exiles; so that he might at
least name one of them all. Let us have the acts of his confessorship
produced, for hitherto we have been in ignorance of them; and so let us
have the satisfaction of reciting his deeds with those of the other
martyrs of Alexandria, and that he may be able to meet the people who
bark against him with the words: <span
id="fr_3085"></span>[3086](#fn_3085) “From henceforth let no man trouble
me, for I bear in my body the marks of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

[Next: His confession of faith is unsatisfactory. No one asked him about
the Trinity, but about Origen's doctrines of the Resurrection, the
origin of souls, and the salvability of Satan. As to the Resurrection
and to Satan he is ambiguous. As to souls he professes
ignorance.](2030777)
