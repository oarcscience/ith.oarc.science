<span id="iv.viii.i.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI</span>.—*Bishops of
Heretical opinions ordained in Antioch after the Banishment of St.
Eustathius* <span id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410) .

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxii-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxii-p3.1"></span>Eulalius</span> was first consecrated in
place of Eustathius. But Eulalius surviving his elevation only a short
period, it was intended that Eusebius of Palestine should be translated
to this bishopric. Eusebius, however, refused the appointment, and the
emperor forbade its being conferred on him. Next Euphronius was put
forward, who also dying, after a lapse of only one year and a few
months, the see was conferred on Flaccillus <span
id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411) . All these bishops secretly clung to
the Arian heresy. Hence it was that most of those individuals, whether
of the clergy or of the laity, who valued the true religion, left the
churches and formed assemblies among themselves. They were called
Eustathians, since it was after the banishment of Eustathius that they
began to hold their meetings. The wretched woman above-mentioned was
soon after attacked by a severe and protracted illness, and then avowed
the imposture in which she had been engaged, and made known the whole
plot, not only to two or three, but to a very large number of priests.
She confessed that she had been bribed to bring this false and impudent
charge, but yet that her <span id="page_58">p. 58</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.xxii-Page_58"></span>oath was not altogether false, as a
certain Eustathius, a coppersmith, was the father of the babe. Such were
some of the crimes perpetrated in Antioch by this most excellent
faction.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxii-p2"></span> Socrates, H E. i. 24, says that on
the deposition of Eustathius “<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxii-p2.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxii-p2.2"></span>φεξῆς ἐπὶ ἔτη ὀκτὼ λέγεται τὸν ἐν
᾽Αντιοχεί& 139· θρόνον τῆς ἐκκλησίας σχολάσαι ὀψὲ δὲ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.xxii-p2.3"></span>…</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.i.xxii-p2.4"></span>χειροτονεῖται
Εὐφρόνιος</span>.” Cf. Soz. H.E. ii. 19. There is much confusion about
this succession of bishops. Jerome (Chron. ii. p. 92) gives the names of
the Arian bishops thrust in succession into the place of Eustathius, as
Eulalius, Eusebius, Eufronius, Placillus. “Perhaps Eulalius was put
forward for the vacant see, like Eusebius, but never actually
appointed.” Bp. Lightfoot, Dict. Christ. Biog. ii. 315.

id="iv.viii.i.xxii-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxii-p4"></span> This name is variously given as
Placillus (Jerome), Placitus (Soz.) Flacillus (Ath. and Eus.), and in
different versions of Theodoret are found <span class="Greek"><span
