<span id="vi.xiii.vii-p1"></span> 6. Next there follows, “<span
class="c14"><span id="vi.xiii.vii-p1.1"></span>And in Christ Jesus, His
Only Son, Our Lord</span>.” “Jesus” is a Hebrew word meaning “Saviour.”
“Christ” is so called from “Chrism,” i.e. unction. For we read in the
Books of Moses, that Auses, the son of Nave, <span
id="fr_3268"></span>[3269](#fn_3268) when he was chosen to lead the
people, had his name changed from “Auses” to “Jesus,” to shew that this
was a name proper for princes and generals, for those, namely, who
should “save” the people who followed them. Therefore, both were called
“Jesus,” both the one who conducted the people, who had been brought
forth out of the land of Egypt, and freed from the wanderings of the
wilderness, into the land of promise, and the other, who conducted the
people, who had been brought forth from the darkness of ignorance, and
recalled from the errors of the world, into the kingdom of heaven.

<span id="vi.xiii.vii-p3"></span>“Christ” is a name proper either to
High Priests or Kings. For formerly both high priests and kings were
consecrated with the ointment of chrism: but these, as mortal and
corruptible, with material and corruptible ointment. Jesus is made
Christ, being anointed with the Holy Spirit, as the Scripture saith of
Him “Whom the Father hath anointed with the Holy Spirit sent down from
heaven.” <span id="fr_3269"></span>[3270](#fn_3269) And Isaiah had
prefigured the same, saying in the person of the Son, “The Spirit of the
Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me, He hath sent Me to preach
good tidings to the poor.” <span id="fr_3270"></span>[3271](#fn_3270)

<span id="vi.xiii.vii-p6"></span>Having shewn them what “Jesus” is, Who
saves His people, and what “Christ” is, Who is made a High Priest for
ever, let us now see in what follows, of Whom these things are said,
“His only Son, our Lord.” Here we are taught that this Jesus, of whom we
have spoken, and this Christ, the meaning of whose name we have
expounded, is “the only Son of God” and “our Lord.” Lest, perchance, you
should think that these human names have an earthly significance, <span
id="page_546">p. 546</span> <span
id="vi.xiii.vii-Page_546"></span>therefore it is added that He is “the
only Son of God, our Lord.” For He is born One of One, because there is
one brightness of light, and there is one word of the understanding.
Neither does an incorporeal generation degenerate into the plural
number, or suffer division, where He Who is born is in no wise separated
from Him Who begets. He is “only” (unique), as thought is to the mind,
as wisdom is to the wise, as a word is to the understanding, as valour
is to the brave. For as the Father is said by the Apostle to be “alone
wise,” <span id="fr_3271"></span>[3272](#fn_3271) so likewise the Son
alone is called wisdom. He is then the “only Son.” And, although in
glory, everlastingness, virtue, dominion, power, He is what the Father
is, yet all these He hath not unoriginately as the Father, but from the
Father, as the Son, without beginning and equal; and although He is the
Head of all things, yet the Father is the Head of Him. For so it is
written, “The Head of Christ is God.” <span
