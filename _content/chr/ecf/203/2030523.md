blessed deacon Ephraim a man of very energetic character and learned in
the holy scriptures was distinguished among the doctors of the church
while his master was still living and especially as an extemporaneous
orator. After the death of his master, overcome by love of reputation,
separating himself from the church, he wrote many things opposed to the
faith. The blessed Ephraim when on the point of death is reported to
have said to him as he stood by his side—See to it, Paulonas that you do
not yield yourself to your own ideas, but when you shall think that you
understand God wholly, believe that you have not known,—for he felt
beforehand from the studies or the words of Paulonus, that he was
investigating new things, and was stretching out his mind to the
illimitable, whence also he frequently called him the new Bardesanes.
