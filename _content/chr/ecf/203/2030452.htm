 of heretics, he sent many letters to different people, which are yet extant; He wrote one to Fabius, bishop of the church at Antioch, <i>On penitence,</i> another <i>To the Romans,</i> by the hand of Hippolytus, two letters <i>To Xystus,</i> who had succeeded Stephen, two also <i>To Philemon and Dionysius,</i> presbyters of the church at Rome, and another <i>To</i> the same <i>Dionysius,</i> afterwards bishop of Rome; and <i>To Novatian,</i> treating of their claim that Novatian had been ordained bishop of Rome, against his will. The beginning of this epistle is as follows: &#8220;Dionysius to Novatian, his brother greeting.
