<span id="iv.x.cxviii-p1"></span> *CXVII. To the Bishop
Florentius.* <span id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898)

<span id="iv.x.cxviii-p3"></span>Truly the grace of our God and Saviour
has not yet abandoned the human race, but has left us a seed in your
holiness “lest we should become as Sodom, and be made like unto
Gomorrah.” <span id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899) This seed suffers
us not altogether to faint, but charges us to wait for the passing away
of the dire storm; this renders us hopeful.

<span id="iv.x.cxviii-p5"></span>We have therefore sent to your holiness
the very godly presbyters Hypatius and Abramius, chorepiscopi, and
Alypius, exarch of our monks, that you may put an end to the disaster
which has befallen the churches of the East; that in the first place you
may confirm the faith handed down to us from the first by the holy
Apostles, may proscribe the heresy that has started up, and openly
convict the men who have the hardihood to debase the preaching of the
Œconomy; <span id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900) and secondly may
fight as champion of them who are being attacked for the truth’s sake.
For it is in the cause of the apostolic Faith, most holy, that we have
undergone that unrighteous massacre, because we refused to abandon the
truth of the Gospel doctrines. Now it behoves your holiness not to
overlook the unjust persecution of men of like mind with yourself, but
by your just help to put a stop to injustice, and teach the assailants
of the truth that men who strive to act unscrupulously at their own good
pleasure cannot be allowed to work out their ends.

<span id="iv.x.cxviii-p2"></span> There were at this time two well known
personages of the name of Florentius to whom this letter may possibly
have been addressed. Florentius the patrician, recipient of Letter
LXXXIX., and Florentius bishop of Sardis. Against the former hypothesis
are the terms of the letter; against the latter the character and
sympathies of the metropolitan of Lydia, if, as Garnerius thinks, he was
an Eutychian. Canon Venables (Dict. Christ Biog. II. 540) supposes a
Florentius bishop of a nameless western see. Garnerius and others think
the letter was probably really addressed to the clergy or bishops
assembled in synod at Rome.
