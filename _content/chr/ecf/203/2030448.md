id="fr_2478"></span>[2479](#fn_2478) afterwards called Gregory, bishop
of Neocæsarea in Pontus, while yet a very young man, in company with his
brother Athenodorus, went from Cappadocia to Berytus, and thence to
Cæsarea in Palestine, to study Greek and Latin literature. When Origen
had seen the remarkable natural ability of these men, he urged them to
study philosophy, in the teaching of which he gradually introduced the
matter of faith in Christ, and made them also his followers. So,
instructed by him for five years, they were sent back by him to their
mother. Theodorus, on his departure, wrote a panegyric of thanks to
Origen, and delivered it before a large assembly, Origen himself being
present. This panegyric is extant at the present day.

<span id="v.iii.lxvii-p4"></span>He wrote also a short, but very
valuable, paraphrase *On Ecclesiastes,* and current report speaks of
other epistles of his, but more especially of the signs and wonders,
which as bishop, he performed to the great glory of the churches.
