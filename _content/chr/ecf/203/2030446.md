are yet extant, in the reign of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, who succeeded
Macrinus, received a commission to restore the city of Emmaus, which
afterwards was called Nicopolis. There is an epistle of his to Origen,
*On the question of Susanna,* where it is contended that this story is
not contained in the Hebrew, and is not consistent with the Hebrew
etymology in respect of the play on “prinos and prisai,” “schinos and
schisai.” In reply to this, Origen wrote a learned epistle. There is
extant another letter of his, *To Aristides,* in which he discusses at
length the discrepancies, which appear in the genealogy of our Saviour,
as recorded by Matthew and Luke.
