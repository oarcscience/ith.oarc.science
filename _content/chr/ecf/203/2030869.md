<span id="vi.xiii.xxi-p1"></span> 20. But, if it does not weary you, let
the point out as briefly as possible, specific references to prophecy in
the Gospels, that those who are being instructed in the first elements
of the faith may have these testimonies written on their hearts, lest
any doubt concerning the things which they believe should at any time
take them by surprise. We are told in the Gospel that Judas, one of
Christ’s friends and associates at table, betrayed Him. Let the show you
how this is foretold in the Psalms: “He who hath eaten My bread hath
lifted up his heel against Me:” <span
id="fr_3303"></span>[3304](#fn_3303) and in another place; “My friends
and My neighbours drew near and set themselves against Me:” <span
id="fr_3304"></span>[3305](#fn_3304) and again; “His words were made
softer than oil and yet be they very darts.” <span
id="fr_3305"></span>[3306](#fn_3305) What then is meant by his words
were made soft? “Judas came to Jesus and said unto Him, Hail, Master,
and kissed Him.” <span id="fr_3306"></span>[3307](#fn_3306) Thus through
the soft blandishment of a kiss he implanted the execrable dart of
betrayal. On which the Lord said to him, “Judas, betrayest thou the Son
of Man with a kiss?” <span id="fr_3307"></span>[3308](#fn_3307) You
observe that He was appraised by the traitor’s covetousness at thirty
pieces of silver. Of this also the Prophet speaks, “And I said unto
them, If ye think good, give me my price, or if not, forbear;” and
presently, “I received from them,” he says, “thirty pieces of silver,
and I cast them into the house of the Lord, into the foundry.” <span
id="fr_3308"></span>[3309](#fn_3308) Is not this what is written in the
Gospels, that Judas, “repenting of what he had done, brought back the
money, and threw it down in the temple and departed?” <span
id="fr_3309"></span>[3310](#fn_3309) Well did He call it His price, as
though blaming and upbraiding. For He had done so many good works among
them, He had given sight to the blind, feet to the lame, the power of
walking to the palsied, life also to the dead; for all these good works
they paid Him death as His price, appraised at thirty pieces of silver.
It is related also in the Gospels that He was bound. This also the word
of prophecy had foretold by Isaiah, saying, “Woe unto their soul, who
have devised a most evil device against themselves, saying, Let us bind
the just One, seeing that He is unprofitable to us.” <span
