<span id="v.iii.lxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.lxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXI.</span>

<span id="v.iii.lxiii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.lxiii-p2.1"></span>Hippolytus</span>, <span
id="fr_2474"></span>[2475](#fn_2474) bishop of some church (the name of
the city I have not been able to learn) wrote *A reckoning of the
Paschal feast and chronological tables* which he worked out up to the
first year of the Emperor Alexander. He also discussed the cycle of
sixteen years, which the Greeks called <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.lxiii-p3.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.lxiii-p3.2"></span>κκαιδεκαετηρίδα</span> and gave the cue to
Eusebius, who composed on the same Paschal feast a cycle of nineteen
years, that is <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.lxiii-p3.3"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.lxiii-p3.4"></span>ννεακαιδεκαετηρίδα</span>. He wrote some
commentaries on the Scriptures, among which are the following: *On the
six days of creation, On Exodus, On the Song of Songs, On Genesis, On
Zechariah, On the Psalms, On Isaiah, On Daniel, On the Apocalypse, On
the Proverbs, On Ecclesiastes, On Saul, On the Pythonissa, On the
Antichrist, On the resurrection, Against Marcion, On the Passover,
Against all heresies,* and an exhortation *On the praise of our Lord and
Saviour,* in which he indicates that he is speaking in the church in the
presence of Origen. Ambrosius, who we have said was converted by Origen
from the heresy of Marcion, to the true faith, urged Origen to write, in
emulation of Hyppolytus, commentaries on the Scriptures, offering him
seven, and even more secretaries, and their expenses, and an equal
number of copyists, and what is still more, with incredible zeal, daily
exacting work from him, on which account Origen, in one of his epistles,
calls him his “Taskmaster.”
