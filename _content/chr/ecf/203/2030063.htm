<p class="c31"><a name="iv.viii.ii.ix-p2"></A><span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.ii.ix-p2.1"></A>The</span> emperor Constantius, having become acquainted with the plots formed against the bishops, wrote to the great Athanasius once, and twice, aye and thrice, exhorting him to <A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A> <a name="iv.viii.ii.ix-Page_74"></A>return from the West&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_498"><FONT SIZE="1">499</FONT></A>
. I shall here insert the second letter, because it is the shortest of the three.</p>  
<p class="c31"><a name="iv.viii.ii.ix-p4"></A>Constantius Augustus the Conqueror to Athanasius.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.ii.ix-p5"></A>&#8220;Although I have already apprised you by previous letters, that you can, without fear of molestation, return to our court, in order that you may, according to my ardent desire, be reinstated in your own bishopric, yet I now again despatch another letter to your gravity to exhort you to take immediately, without fear or suspicion, a public vehicle and return to us, in order that you may receive all that you desire.&#8221;</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.ii.ix-p6"></A>When Athanasius returned, Constantius received him with kindness, and bade him go back to the Church of Alexandria&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_499"></A><A HREF="#fn_499"><FONT SIZE="1">500</FONT></A>
. But there were some attached to the court, infected with the errors of Arianism, who maintained that Athanasius ought to cede one church to those who were unwilling to hold communion with him. On this being mentioned to the emperor, and by the emperor to Athanasius, he remarked, that the imperial command appeared to be just; but that he also wished to make a request. The emperor readily promising to grant him whatever he might ask, he said that those in Antioch&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_500"></A><A HREF="#fn_500"><FONT SIZE="1">501</FONT></A>
 who objected to hold communion with the party now in possession of the churches wanted temples to pray in, and that it was only fair that one House of God also be assigned to them. This request was deemed just and reasonable by the emperor; but the leaders of the Arian faction resisted its being carried into execution, maintaining that neither party ought to have the churches assigned to them. Constantius on this was struck with high admiration for Athanasius, and sent him back to Alexandria&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_501"></A><A HREF="#fn_501"><FONT SIZE="1">502</FONT></A>
. Gregorius was dead, having met his end at the hands of the Alexandrians themselves&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_502"><FONT SIZE="1">503</FONT></A>
. The people kept high holiday in honour of their pastor; feasting marked their joy at seeing him again, and praise was given to God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">504</FONT></A>

Cf. the graphic account of his entry into Rome &#8220;velut collo munito rectam aciem luminum tendens, nec dextra vultum nec l&aelig;va flectebat, tanquam figmentum hominis: non cum rota concuteret nutans nec spuens aut os aut nasum tergens vel fricans manumve agitans visus est unquam.&#8221; Amm.
