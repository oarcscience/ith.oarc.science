<span id="v.iv.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.xviii-p2.1"></span>Rufinus</span>, <span
id="fr_2598"></span>[2599](#fn_2598) presbyter of the church at
Aquileia, was not the least among the doctors of the church and had a
fine talent for elegant translation from Greek into Latin. In this way
he opened to the Latin speaking church the greater part of the Greek
literature; translating the works of Basil of Cæsarea in Cappadocia,
Gregory Nazianzan, that most eloquent man, the *Recognitions* of Clement
of Rome, the *Church history* of Eusebius of Cæsarea in Palestine, the
*Sentences* of Xystus, <span id="fr_2599"></span>[2600](#fn_2599) the
*Sentences* of Evagrius and the work of Pamphilus Martyr *Against the
mathematicians.* Whatever among all these which are read by the Latins
have prefatory matter, have been translated by Rufinus, but those which
are without Prologue have been translated by some one else who did not
choose to write a prologue. Not all of Origen, however, is his work, for
Jerome translated some which are identified by his prologue. On his own
account, the same Rufinus, ever through the grace of God published an
*Exposition of the Apostles’ creed* so excellent that other expositions
are regarded as of no account in comparison. He also wrote in a
threefold sense, that is, the historical, moral and mystical sense, on
Jacob’s blessing on the patriarchs. He wrote also many epistles
exhorting to fear of God, among which those which he addressed to Proba
are preëminent. He added also a tenth and eleventh book to the
ecclesiastical history which we have said was written by Eusebius and
translated by him. Moreover he responded to a detractor of his works, in
two volumes, arguing and proving that he exercised his talent with the
aid of the Lord and in the sight of God, for the good of the church,
while he, on the other hand, incited by jealousy had taken to polemics.
