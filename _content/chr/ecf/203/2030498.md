id="fr_2547"></span>[2548](#fn_2547) deacon of the church at Edessa,
composed many works in the Syriac language, and became so distinguished
that his writings are repeated publicly in some churches, after the
reading of the Scriptures.

<span id="v.iii.cxvii-p4"></span>I once read in Greek a volume by him
*On the Holy Spirit,* which some one had translated from the Syriac, and
recognized even in translation, the incisive power of lofty genius. He
died in the reign of Valens.
