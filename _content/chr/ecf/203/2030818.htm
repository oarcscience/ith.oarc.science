<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xii.iii.xvi-p1"></A>  15. What your opinions are on the resurrection of the flesh, we have already learned from your Apology. &#8220;No member will be cut off, nor any part of the body destroyed.&#8221; This is the clear and open profession which you make in your innocence, and which you say is accepted by all the bishops of Italy. I should believe your statement, but that the matter of that book which is not Pamphilus&#146; makes me doubt about you. And I wonder that Italy should have approved what Rome rejected; that the bishops should have accepted what the Apostolic see condemned.</p>
