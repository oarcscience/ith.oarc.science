<span id="iv.x.xxiii-p1"></span> *XXIII. To the Patrician
Areobindas.* <span id="fr_1660"></span>[1661](#fn_1660)

<span id="iv.x.xxiii-p3"></span>In distributing wealth and poverty among
men the Creator and Governor of all gives no unjust judgment, but gives
the poverty of the poor to the rich as a means of usefulness. So He
brings chastisement upon men not merely in the infliction of punishment
for their faults, but to provide the wealthy with opportunities for
shewing kindness to mankind. This year the Lord has sent us scourges,
far less than our sins, but enough to distress the husbandmen, of whose
sufferings I lately made your magnificence acquainted through your own
hinds. Pity, I beseech you, the tillers of the ground, who have spent
their toil with but very little result. Be this bad year a suggestion of
spiritual abundance, and do ye through the exercise of compassion gather
in the harvest of the compassion of God. On this account the excellent
Dionysius has hurried to your greatness to tell you of the trouble, that
he may receive the remedy. He carries this letter, like a suppliant’s
branch of olive, in the hope that by its means he may receive greater
kindness.
