<span id="iv.viii.i.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI</span>.—*Another plot
against Athanasius*.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxvii-p2.1"></span>The</span> calumniators of Athanasius,
however, did not desist from their attempts. On the contrary, they
devised so bold a fiction against him, that it surpassed every invention
of the ancient writers of the tragic or comic stage. They again bribed
individuals of the same party, and brought them before the emperor,
vociferously accusing that champion of virtue of many abominable crimes.
The leaders of the party were Eusebius, Theognis, and Theodorus, bishop
of Perinthus, a city now called Heraclea <span
id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432) . After having accused Athanasius of
crimes which they described as too shocking to be tolerated, or even
listened to, they persuaded the emperor to convene a council at Cæsarea
in Palestine, where Athanasius had many enemies, and to command that his
cause should be there tried. The emperor, utterly ignorant of the plot
that had been devised, was persuaded by them to give the required order.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxvii-p4"></span>But the holy Athanasius, well aware
of the malevolence of those who were to try him, refused to appear at
the council. This served as a pretext to those who opposed the truth to
criminate him still further; and they accused him before the emperor of
contumacy and arrogance. Nor were their hopes altogether frustrated; for
the emperor, although exceedingly forbearing, became exasperated by
their representations, and wrote to him in an angry manner, commanding
him to repair to Tyre. Here the council was ordered to assemble, from
the suspicion, as I think, that Athanasius had an apprehension of
Cæsarea on account of its bishop. The emperor wrote also to the council
in a style consistent with his devoted piety. His letter is as follows.
