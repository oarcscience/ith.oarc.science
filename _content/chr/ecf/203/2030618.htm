</span> the Mauritanian was ordained presbyter in Gaul. He composed a dialectical treatise in eight books <i>On the nature of the soul and its properties,</i> also one <i>On the resurrection</i> and its particular bearing for the faithful in this life and in general for all men, written in clear language and style, in the form of a dialogue between Julian the bishop, and Verus the presbyter. The first book contains discourses on what the soul is and in what sense it is thought to be created in the image of God, the second, whether the soul should be thought of as corporeal or incorporeal, the third, how the soul of the first man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2750"></A><A HREF="#fn_2750"><FONT SIZE="1">2751</FONT></A>
 was made, fourth, whether the soul which is put in the body at birth is newly created and without sin, or produced from the substance of the first man like a shoot from a root it brings also with it the original sin of the first man, fifth, a review of the fourth book of the discussion,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2751"></A><A HREF="#fn_2751"><FONT SIZE="1">2752</FONT></A>
 and an inquiry as to what is the capability of the soul, that is its possibilities, and that it gains its capability from a single and pure will, the sixth, whence arises the conflict between flesh and the spirit, spoken of by the apostle, seventh, on the difference between the flesh and the spirit in respect of life, of death and of resurrection, the eighth, answers to questions concerning the things which it is predicted will happen at the end of the world, to such questions, that is, as are usually propounded concerning the resurrection. I remember to have once read a hortatory work of his, addressed to some one named Principius, <i>On contempt of the world, and of transitory things,</i> and another entitled, <i>On vices and virtues.</i> He is said to have written yet other works, which have not come to my knowledge, and to be still writing. He is still living, and his life is worthy of Christian profession, and his rank in the church.</p>
