id="v.iv.xix-p2.1"></span>Tichonius</span>, <span
id="fr_2600"></span>[2601](#fn_2600) an African by nationality was, it
is said, sufficiently learned in sacred literature, not wholly
unacquainted with secular literature and zealous in ecclesiastical
affairs. He wrote books *On internal war* and *Expositions of various
causes* in which for the defence of his friends, he cites the ancient
councils and from all of which <span
id="fr_2601"></span>[2602](#fn_2601) he is recognized to have been a
Donatist. He composed also eight *Rules for investigating and
ascertaining the meaning of the Scriptures,* compressing them into one
volume. He also expounded the Apocalypse of John entire, regarding
nothing in it in a carnal sense, but all in a spiritual sense. In this
exposition he maintained the angelical nature <span
id="fr_2602"></span>[2603](#fn_2602) to be corporeal, moreover he doubts
that there will be a reign of the righteous on earth for a thousand
years after the resurrection, or that there will be two resurrections of
the dead in the flesh, one of the righteous and the other of the
unrighteous, but maintains that there will be one simultaneous
resurrection of all, at which shall arise even the aborted and the
deformed lest any living human being, however deformed, should be lost.
He makes such distinction to be sure, between the two resurrections as
to make the first, which he calls the apocalypse of the righteous, only
to take place in the growth of the church where, justified by faith,
they are raised from the dead bodies of their sins through baptism to
the service of eternal life, but the second, the general resurrection of
all men in the flesh. This man flourished at the same period with the
above mentioned Rufinus during the reign of Theodosius and his sons.
