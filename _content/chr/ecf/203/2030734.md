<span id="vi.xi.iii.l-p1"></span> 45. After this Apology had been
written, one of the brethren who came to us from you at Rome and helped
me in revising it, observed that one point in my defence had been passed
over which he had heard adversely dwelt upon by my detractors there. The
point turns upon a statement in my Preface, where I said of him who is
now my persecutor and accuser that in the works of Origen which he
translated there are found certain grounds of offence in the Greek, but
that he has in his translation so cleared them away that the Latin
reader will find nothing in them which is dissonant from our faith. On
this sentence they remark: “You see how he has praised his method of
translation and has borne his testimony that in the books he has
translated no grounds of offence are to be found, and promised that he
would himself follow the same method. Why then is not his own
translation free from grounds of offence, as he bears witness is the
case with the writings of the other?”
