He has the reputation among the Syrians of having been a brilliant genius and vehement in argument. He wrote a multitude of works against almost all heresies which had come into existence in his time. Among these a most remarkable and strong work is the one which he addressed to Marcus Antoninus <i>On fate,</i> and many other volumes <i>On persecution</i> which his followers translated from the Syriac language into Greek.
