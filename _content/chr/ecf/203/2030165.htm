<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.viii.v.xxv-p2"></A> Theodosius died of dropsy at Milan, Jan. 17, 395. &#8220;The character of Theodosius is one of the most perplexing in history. The church historians have hardly a word of blame for him except in the matter of the massacre of Thessalonica, and that seems to be almost atoned for in their eyes by its perpetrator&#146;s penitent submission to ecclesiastical censure. On the other hand the heathen historians, represented by Zosimus, condemn in the most unmeasured terms his insolence, his love of pleasure, his pride, and hint at the scandalous immorality of his life.&#8221; &#8220;It is the fashion to call him the Great, and we may admit that he has as good a right to that title as Lewis XIV., a monarch whom in some respects he pretty closely resembles. But it seems to me that it would be safer to withhold this title from both sovereigns, and to call them not the Great, but the Magnificent.&#8221; Hodgkin, <i>Dynasty of Theodosius.</i> 133.</p>
