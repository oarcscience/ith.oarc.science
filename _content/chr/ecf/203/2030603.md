id="v.iv.lxxxiv-p2.1"></span>Samuel, <span
id="fr_2718"></span>[2719](#fn_2718) </span> presbyter of the church at
Edessa, is said to have written many things in Syriac against the
enemies of the church, especially against the Nestorians, the Eutychians
and the Timotheans, new heresies all, but differing from one another. On
this account he frequently speaks of the triple beast, while he briefly
refutes by the opinion of the church, and the authority of Holy
Scriptures, showing to the Nestorians, that the Son was God in man, not
simply man born of a Virgin, to the Eutychians, that he had true human
flesh, taken on by God, and not merely a body made of thick air, or
shown from Heaven; to the Timotheans, that the Word was made flesh in
such wise, that the Word remains Word in substance, and, human nature
remaining human nature, one person of the Son of God is produced by
union, not by mingling. He is said to be still living at Constantinople,
for at the beginning of the reign of Anthemius, I knew his writings, and
knew that he was in the land of the living.
