<span id="v.iv.xcix-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.xcix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XCVIII.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xcix-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.xcix-p2.1"></span>Pomerius <span
id="fr_2749"></span>[2750](#fn_2749) </span> the Mauritanian was
ordained presbyter in Gaul. He composed a dialectical treatise in eight
books *On the nature of the soul and its properties,* also one *On the
resurrection* and its particular bearing for the faithful in this life
and in general for all men, written in clear language and style, in the
form of a dialogue between Julian the bishop, and Verus the presbyter.
The first book contains discourses on what the soul is and in what sense
it is thought to be created in the image of God, the second, whether the
soul should be thought of as corporeal or incorporeal, the third, how
the soul of the first man <span id="fr_2750"></span>[2751](#fn_2750) was
made, fourth, whether the soul which is put in the body at birth is
newly created and without sin, or produced from the substance of the
first man like a shoot from a root it brings also with it the original
sin of the first man, fifth, a review of the fourth book of the
discussion, <span id="fr_2751"></span>[2752](#fn_2751) and an inquiry as
to what is the capability of the soul, that is its possibilities, and
that it gains its capability from a single and pure will, the sixth,
whence arises the conflict between flesh and the spirit, spoken of by
the apostle, seventh, on the difference between the flesh and the spirit
in respect of life, of death and of resurrection, the eighth, answers to
questions concerning the things which it is predicted will happen at the
end of the world, to such questions, that is, as are usually propounded
concerning the resurrection. I remember to have once read a hortatory
work of his, addressed to some one named Principius, *On contempt of the
world, and of transitory things,* and another entitled, *On vices and
virtues.* He is said to have written yet other works, which have not
come to my knowledge, and to be still writing. He is still living, and
his life is worthy of Christian profession, and his rank in the church.
