id="v.iii.lxxxix-p2.1"></span>Athanasius <span
id="fr_2511"></span>[2512](#fn_2511) </span> bishop of Alexandria, hard
pressed by the wiles of the Arians, fled to Constans emperor of Gaul.
Returning thence with letters and, after the death of the emperor, again
taking refuge in flight, he kept in hiding until the accession of
Jovian, when he returned to the church and died in the reign of Valens.
Various works by him are in circulation; two books *Against the
nations,* one *Against Valens and Ursacius, On virginity,* very many *On
the persecutions of the Arians,* also *On the titles of the Psalms* and
*Life of Anthony the monk,* also *Festal epistles* and other works too
numerous to mention.
