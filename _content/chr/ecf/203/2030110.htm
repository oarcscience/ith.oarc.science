 For Julian, as was to be expected of one who had gone to war with our Lord and Saviour, had stopped even this mainten<A NAME="page_110"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 110</FONT></A> <a name="iv.viii.iv.iv-Page_110"></A>ance, and since the famine which visited the empire in consequence of Julian&#146;s iniquity prevented the collection of the contribution of Constantine&#146;s enactment, Jovian ordered a third part to be supplied for the present, and promised that on the cessation of the famine he would give the whole.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.iv-p4"></A>After distinguishing the beginning of his reign by edicts of this kind, Jovian set out from Antioch for the Bosphorus; but at Dadastan&aelig;, a village lying on the confines of Bithynia and Galatia, he died.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_674"></A><A HREF="#fn_674"><FONT SIZE="1">675</FONT></A>
 He set out on his journey from this world with the grandest and fairest support and stay, but all who had experienced the clemency of his sway were left behind in pain. So, methinks, the Supreme Ruler, to convict us of our iniquity, both shews us good things and again deprives us of them; so by the former means He teaches us how easily He can give us what He will; by the latter He convicts us of our unworthiness of it, and points us to the better life.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.viii.iv.iv-p5"></A> At an obscure place called Dadastan&aelig;, half way between Ancyra and Nic&aelig;a, after a hearty supper he went to bed in a room newly built. The plaster was still damp, and a brazier of charcoal was brought in to warm the air. In the morning he was found dead in his bed. (Amm. xxv. 10. 12. 13.) This was in February or March, 364.</p>
