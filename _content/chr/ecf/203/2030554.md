<span id="v.iv.xxxv-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.xxxv-p2.1"></span>Theophilus, <span
id="fr_2627"></span>[2628](#fn_2627) </span> bishop of the church <span
id="fr_2628"></span>[2629](#fn_2628) of Alexandria, wrote one great
volume *Against Origen* in which he condemns pretty nearly all his
sayings and himself likewise, at the same time saying that he was not
original in his views but derived them from the ancient fathers
especially from Heraclas, that he was deposed from <span
id="fr_2629"></span>[2630](#fn_2629) the office of presbyter driven from
the church and compelled to fly from the city. He also wrote *Against
the Anthropomorphites,* heretics who say that God has the human form and
members, confuting in a long discussion and arguing by testimonies of
Divine Scripture and convincing. He shows that, according to the belief
of the Fathers, God is to be thought of as incorporal, not formed with
any suggestion of members at all, and therefore there is nothing like
Him among created things in substance, nor has the incorruptibility nor
unchangeableness nor incorporeality of his nature been given to any one
but that all intellectual natures are corporeal, all corruptible, all
mutable, that He alone should not be subject to corruptibility or
changeableness, who alone has immortality and life. Likewise the return
of the paschal feast which the great council at Nicea had found would
take place after ninety years at the same time, the same month and day
adding some observations on the festival and explanations he gave to the
emperor Theodosius. I have read also three books *On faith,* which bear
his name but, as their language is not like his, I do not very much
think they are by him.
