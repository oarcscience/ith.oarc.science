<span id="v.iii.v-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.v-p2.1"></span>Matthew</span>, <span
id="fr_2348"></span>[2349](#fn_2348) also called Levi, apostle and
aforetimes publican, composed a gospel of Christ at first published in
Judea in Hebrew <span id="fr_2349"></span>[2350](#fn_2349) for the sake
of those of the circumcision who believed, but this was afterwards
translated into Greek though by what author is uncertain. The Hebrew
itself has been preserved until the present day in the library at
Cæsarea which Pamphilus so diligently gathered. I have also had the
opportunity of having the volume described to me by the Nazarenes <span
id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350) of Berœa, <span
id="fr_2351"></span>[2352](#fn_2351) a city of Syria, who use it. In
this it is to be noted that wherever the Evangelist, whether on his own
account or in the person of our Lord the Saviour quotes the testimony of
the Old Testament he does not follow the authority of the translators of
the Septuagint but the Hebrew. Wherefore these two forms exist “Out of
Egypt have I called my son,” and “for he shall be called a Nazarene.”
