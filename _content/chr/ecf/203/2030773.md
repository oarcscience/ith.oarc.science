<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p1"></span> <span id="page_501">p. 501</span>
<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-Page_501"></span><span class="c21"><span
id="vi.xii.ii.i-p1.1"></span>Book II.</span>

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="vi.xii.ii.i-p2.1"></span>Summary of the Chapters.</span>

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p3"></span>1–3. A criticism on Rufinus’ Apology to
Anastasius. His excuses for not coming to Rome are absurd. His parents
are dead and the journey is easy. No one ever heard before of his being
imprisoned or exiled for the faith.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p4"></span>4–8. His confession of faith is
unsatisfactory. No one asked him about the Trinity, but about Origen’s
doctrines of the Resurrection, the origin of souls, and the salvability
of Satan. As to the Resurrection and to Satan he is ambiguous. As to
souls he professes ignorance.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p5"></span>9. What Latin! The poor souls must be
tormented by his barbarisms.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p6"></span>10. It is not permitted to you to be
ignorant of such a matter which all the churches know.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p7"></span>11. As to translating the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p7.1"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span>, it
is not a question, but a charge that you unjustifiably altered the book.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p8"></span>12, 13. Origen asserts Christ to be a
creature, and maintains universal restitution. Where has he contradicted
this?

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p9"></span>14. The question is, as Anastasius says
to John of Jerusalem, with what motive you translated the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p9.1"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span>

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p10"></span>15. You pretend not to be Origen’s
defender, but you publish and enlarge the Apology for him and allege the
heretics’ falsification of his works.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p11"></span>16. Your defence gains no support from
Eusebius or Didymus, who, each for his own reason, defend the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p11.1"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span> as
it stands.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p12"></span>17. If we may allege falsification at
every turn we make a chaos of all past literature.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p13"></span>18. The object of Origen’s letter, of
which he translates only a part, is not to shew the falsification of his
writings but to vituperate the Bishops who condemned him.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p14"></span>19. It is only in reference to a
particular point in his dispute with Candidus that Origen alleges this
falsification. The story of Hilary’s being condemned through his
writings having been falsified has no foundation.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p15"></span>20. That which you tell about myself
in Damasus’ council is mere after-dinner gossip.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p16"></span>21–2. The attack on Epiphanius as a
plagiarist of Origen is an outrage on the Bishops generally. Origen
never wrote 6000 books.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p17"></span>23. I ascertained at the library at
Cæsarea that the Apology you quote as Pamphilus’ is the work of
Eusebius.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p18"></span>24. The letter falsely circulated in
Africa as mine, and expressing regret for my translation of the Old
Test. from the Hebrew bears the mark of your hand. I have always
honoured the Seventy Translators.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p19"></span>25–32. In proof of this, I bring
forward the prefaces to my Translation of the Books from Genesis to
Isaiah.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p20"></span>33. As to Daniel, it was necessary to
point out that Bel and the Dragon, and similar stories were not found in
the Hebrew.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p21"></span>34. A vindication of the importance of
the Hebrew Text of Scripture.

<span id="vi.xii.ii.i-p22"></span>35. Though the LXX has been of great
value, we should be grateful for fresh translations from the original.
