<span id="iv.x.xxxiii-p1"></span> *XXXIII. To Stasimus, Count and
Primate. <span id="fr_1672"></span>[1673](#fn_1672)*

<span id="iv.x.xxxiii-p3"></span>To narrate the sufferings of the most
honourable and dignified Celestinianus would require tragic eloquence.
Tragic writers set forth fully the ills of humanity, but I can only in a
word inform your excellency that his country is Libya, so long on all
men’s tongues, his city the far famed Carthage, his hereditary rank a
seat in her famous council, his circumstances affluent. But all this is
now a tale, mere words stripped bare of realities. The barbarian war has
deprived him of all this. But such is fortune; she refuses to remain
always with the same men and hastens to change her abode to dwell with
others. <span id="fr_1673"></span>[1674](#fn_1673) I beg to introduce
this guest to your excellency, and beseech you that he may enjoy your
far famed beneficence. I beg also that through your excellency he may
become known to all those who are in office and opulence, in order that
you may both become a means of advantage to them and win the higher
reward from our merciful God.
