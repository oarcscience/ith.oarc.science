<p class="c23"><a name="v.ii.ii-p1"></A>  2. <i>Literature</i>.</p>  
<p class="c31"><a name="v.ii.ii-p2"></A>1. <i>The literature on Jerome</i> is immense. The most often quoted general works are Z&ouml;ckler, <i>Hieronymus.</i> Gotha, 1865 and Thierry, <i>St. J&eacute;rome</i> Par. 1867. On Jerome in general the article by Freemantle in Smith and Wace <i>Dict. of Christian Biography</i> is the first for the English reader to turn to. Ceillier and other patrologies, while sufficiently full for their purpose, give very little special treatment to this work, Ebert (<i>Gesch. chr.-Lat.-Lit.</i> Lpz. 1874) being a partial exception to this statement. The best literary sources are the prolegomena and notes to the various editions of the work itself. Much the same may be said of <i>Gennadius</i> though the relative importance of his catalogue among his writings gives that a larger proportionate attention. In English the article by Cazenove in Smith and Wace and in French the account in the Histoire litteraire de la France are the best generally accessible references.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="v.ii.ii-p3"></A>2. <i>Literature on the writers mentioned by Jerome and Gennadius.</i> Any one who cares to follow up in English the study of any of the writers mentioned in the Lives of illustrious men will find tools therefor: 1. For the earlier writers to the time of Eusebius, Eusebius Church History tr. M&#146;Giffert (N. Y. Chr. Lit. Co.) <i>notes.</i> 2. For the whole period: Smith and Wace Dict. of Christian Biography, 4 vols. and more accessible to most (though a cheap reprint of Smith and Wace is now threatened) Schaff. Church Hist. (N. Y. Scribners) where at the end of each volume an account is given of the chief writers of the period including admirable bibliographical reference.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="v.ii.ii-p4"></A>Of course the best source is the works themselves: <i>The Ante-Nicene Fathers,</i> ed. Coxe, <i>The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers</i> ed. Schaff and Wace. (N. Y. Christian Literature Co.) For further research the student is referred to the list of Patrologies and Bibliographies in the supplementary volume of the Ante-Nicene Fathers, to the bibliography of Ante-Nicene Fathers in the same volume, to Chevalier. Dict. des sources hist. and the memoranda by Sittl, in the Jahresberichte &uuml;. d. fortschr. d. class. Alterthwiss. 1887 sq.</p>
