<p class="c31"><a name="iv.viii.v.xxix-p2"></A><span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.v.xxix-p2.1"></A>On</span> receiving information that Ph&#339;nicia was still suffering from the madness of the demons&#146; rites, John got together certain monks who were fired with divine zeal, armed them with imperial edicts and despatched them against the idols&#146; shrines. The money which was required to pay the craftsmen and their assistants who were engaged in the work of destruction was not taken by John from imperial resources, but he persuaded certain wealthy and faithful women to make liberal contributions, pointing out to them how great would be the blessing their generosity would win.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.v.xxix-p3"></A>Thus the remaining shrines of the demons were utterly destroyed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_916"></A><A HREF="#fn_916"><FONT SIZE="1">917</FONT></A>
