<span id="iv.viii.iii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII</span>.—*Of the boldness
of speech of the decurion of Berœa*. <span
id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651)

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xvii-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xvii-p3.1"></span>After</span> starting with these
threats he was put down by one single Berœan. Illustrious as this man
was from the fact of his holding the chief place among the magistrates,
he was made yet more illustrious by his zeal. On seeing his son falling
into the prevailing paganism, he drove him from his home and publicly
renounced him. The youth made his way to the emperor in the near
neighbourhood of the city and informed him both of his own views and of
his father’s sentence. The emperor bade him make his mind easy and
promised to reconcile his father to him. When he reached Berœa, he
invited the men of office and of high position to a banquet. Among them
was the young suppliant’s father, and both father and son were ordered
to take their places on the imperial couch. In the middle of the
entertainment Julian <span id="page_105">p. 105</span> <span
id="iv.viii.iii.xvii-Page_105"></span>said to the father, “It does not
seem to me to be right to force a mind otherwise inclined and having no
wish to shift its allegiance. Your son does not wish to follow your
doctrines. Do not force him. Even I, though I am easily able to compel
you, do not try to force you to follow mine.” Then the father, moved by
his faith in divine truth to sharpen the debate, exclaimed “Sir,” said
he “are you speaking of this wretch whom God hates <span
id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652) and who has preferred lies to truth?”

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xvii-p5"></span>Once more Julian put on the mask
of mildness and said “Cease fellow from reviling,” and then, turning his
face to the youth, “I,” said he, “will have care for you, since I have
not been able to persuade your father to do so.” I mention this
circumstance with a distinct wish to point out not only this worthy
man’s admirable boldness, but that very many persons despised Julian’s
sway.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.xvii-p2"></span> Valesius points out that <span
class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.xvii-p2.1"></span>πολιτεύεσθαι</span> means to hold the
rank of Curiales or Decuriones. The Berœa mentioned is presumably the
Syrian Berœa now Haleb or Aleppo.
