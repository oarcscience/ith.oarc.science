<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.xxii-p1"></A>  21. But, says some one, &#8220;Are these things to be understood of the Lord? Could the Lord be held prisoner by men and dragged to judgment?&#8221; Of this also the same Prophet shall convince you. For he says, &#8220;The Lord Himself shall come into judgment with the elders and princes of the people.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3311"></A><A HREF="#fn_3311"><FONT SIZE="1">3312</FONT></A>
 The Lord is judged then according to the Prophet&#146;s testimony, and not only judged, but scourged, and smitten on the face with the palms (of men&#146;s hands), and spitted on, and suffers every insult and indignity for our sake. And because all who should hear these things preached by the Apostles would be perfectly amazed, therefore also the Prophet speaking in their person exclaims, &#8220;Lord, who hath believed our report?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3312"></A><A HREF="#fn_3312"><FONT SIZE="1">3313</FONT></A>
 For it is incredible that God, the Son of God, should be spoken of and preached as having suffered these things. For this reason they are foretold by the Prophets, lest any doubt should spring up in those who are about to believe. Christ the Lord Himself therefore in His own person, <A NAME="page_552"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 552</FONT></A> <a name="vi.xiii.xxii-Page_552"></A>says, &#8220;I gave My back to the scourges, and My cheeks to the palms,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3313"></A><A HREF="#fn_3313"><FONT SIZE="1">3314</FONT></A>
 I turned not away My face from shame and spitting.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3314"></A><A HREF="#fn_3314"><FONT SIZE="1">3315</FONT></A>
 This also is written among His other sufferings, that they bound Him, and led Him away to Pilate. This also the Prophet foretold, saying, &#8220;And they bound him and conducted Him as a pledge of friendship <i>(xenium)</i> to King Jarim.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3315"></A><A HREF="#fn_3315"><FONT SIZE="1">3316</FONT></A>
 But some one objects, &#8220;But Pilate was not a king.&#8221; Hear then what the Gospel relates next, &#8220;Pilate hearing that He was from Galilee, sent Him to Herod, who was king in Israel at that time.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3316"></A><A HREF="#fn_3316"><FONT SIZE="1">3317</FONT></A>
 And rightly does the Prophet add the name &#8220;Jarim,&#8221; which means &#8220;a wild-vine, for Herod was not of the house of Israel, nor of that Israelitish vine which the Lord had brought out of Egypt, and &#8220;planted in a very fruitful hill,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3317"></A><A HREF="#fn_3317"><FONT SIZE="1">3318</FONT></A>
 but was a wild vine, i.e. of an alien stock. Rightly, therefore, was he called &#8220;a wild-vine,&#8221; because he in nowise sprung from the shoots of the vine of Israel. And whereas the Prophet used the phrase &#8220;<i>xenium,</i>&#8221; &#8220;A pledge of friendship,&#8221; this also corresponds, &#8220;For Herod and Pilate,&#8221; as the Gospel witnesses, &#8220;from being enemies were made friends,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3318"></A><A HREF="#fn_3318"><FONT SIZE="1">3319</FONT></A>
 and, as though in token of their reconciliation, each sent Jesus bound to the other. What matter, so long as Jesus, as Saviour, reconciles those who were at variance, and restores peace, and also brings back concord! Wherefore of this also it is written in Job, &#8220;May the Lord reconcile the hearts of the princes of the earth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3319"></A><A HREF="#fn_3319"><FONT SIZE="1">3320</FONT></A>
