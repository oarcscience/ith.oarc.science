<span id="v.iii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.xvii-p2.1"></span>Clement</span>, <span
id="fr_2400"></span>[2401](#fn_2400) of whom the apostle Paul writing to
the Philippians says “With Clement and others of my fellow-workers whose
names are written in the book of life,” <span
id="fr_2401"></span>[2402](#fn_2401) the fourth bishop of Rome after
Peter, if indeed the second was Linus and the third Anacletus, <span
id="fr_2402"></span>[2403](#fn_2402) although most of the Latins think
that Clement was second after the apostle. <span
id="fr_2403"></span>[2404](#fn_2403) He wrote, on the part of the church
of Rome, an especially valuable *Letter to the church of the
Corinthians,* which in some places is publicly read, and which seems to
me to agree in style with the epistle to the Hebrews which passes under
the name of Paul but it differs from this same epistle, not only in many
of its ideas, but also in respect of the order of words, and its
likeness in either respect is not very great. There is also a second
*Epistle* under his name which is rejected by earlier writers, and a
*Disputation between Peter and Appion* written out at length, which
Eusebius in the third book of his Church history rejects. He died in the
third year of Trajan and a church built at Rome preserves the memory of
his name unto this day.

<span id="v.iii.xvii-p3"></span> Bishop 91 or 2–101. Died 110 (Euseb.
Ch. Hist.) It is by no means certain that Clemens Romanus is the Clemens
mentioned in the New Testament. Compare discussions by Salmon in Smith
and Wace, and M’Giffert in his translation of Eusebius.
