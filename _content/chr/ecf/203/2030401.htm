 the pupil of John, bishop of Hierapolis in Asia, wrote only five volumes, which he entitled <i>Exposition of the words of our Lord,</i> in which, when he had asserted in his preface that he did not follow various opinions but had the apostles for authority, he said &#8220;I considered what Andrew and Peter said, what Philip, what Thomas, what James, what John,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2410"></A><A HREF="#fn_2410"><FONT SIZE="1">2411</FONT></A>
 what Matthew or any one else among the disciples of our Lord, what also Aristion and the elder John, disciples of the Lord had said, not so much that I have their books to read, as that their living voice is heard until the present day in the authors themselves.&#8221; It appears through this catalogue of names that the John who is placed among the disciples is not the same as the elder John whom he places after Aristion in his enumeration. This we say moreover because of the opinion mentioned above, where we record that it is declared by many that the last two epistles of John are the work not of the apostle but of the presbyter.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="v.iii.xx-p5"></A>He is said to have published a <i>Second coming of Our Lord or Millennium.</i> Iren&aelig;us and Apollinaris and others who say that after the resurrection the Lord will reign in the flesh with the saints, follow him. Tertullian also in his work <i>On the hope of the faithful,</i> Victorinus of Petau and Lactantius follow this view.</p>
