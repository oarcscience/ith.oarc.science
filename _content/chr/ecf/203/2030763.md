<span id="vi.xii.i.xxv-p1"></span> 24. A third passage with which he
finds fault is that in which I gave a threefold interpretation of the
Apostle’s words: <span id="fr_3047"></span>[3048](#fn_3047) “That in the
ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness
towards us in Christ Jesus.” The first was my own opinion, the second
the opposite opinion held by Origen, the third the simple explanation
given by Apollinarius. As to the fact that I did not give their names, I
must ask for pardon on the ground that it was done through modesty. I
did not wish to disparage men whom I was partly following. and whose
opinions I was translating into the Latin tongue. But, I said, the
diligent reader will at once search into these things and form his own
opinion. And I repeated at the end: Another turns to a different sense
the words ‘That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches
of his grace.’ “Ah,” you will say, “I see that in the character of the
diligent reader you have unfolded the opinions of Origen.” I confess
that I was wrong. I ought to have said not The diligent but The
blasphemous reader. If I had anticipated that you would adopt measures
of this kind I might have done this, and so have avoided your calumnious
speeches. It is, I suppose, a great crime to have called Origen a
diligent reader, especially when I had translated seventy books of his
and had praised him up to the sky,—for doing which I had to defend
myself in a short treatise <span id="fr_3048"></span>[3049](#fn_3048)
two years ago in answer to your trumpeting of my praises. In those
‘praises’ which you gave me you laid it to my charge that I had spoken
of Origen as a teacher of the churches, and now that you speak in the
character of an enemy you think that I shall be afraid because you
accuse me of calling him a diligent reader. Why, even shopkeepers who
are particularly frugal, and slaves who are not wasteful, and the
care-takers who made our childhood a burden to us and even thieves when
they are particularly clever, we speak of as diligent; and so the
conduct of the unjust steward in the Gospel is spoken of as wise.
Moreover <span id="fr_3049"></span>[3050](#fn_3049) “The children of
this world are wiser than the children of light,” and <span
id="fr_3050"></span>[3051](#fn_3050) “The serpent was wiser than all the
beasts which the Lord had made on the earth.”
