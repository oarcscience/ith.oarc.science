<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.xlvi-p1"></A>  45. Thus much in proof of the profession which we make in the Creed when we say &#8220;The resurrection of this flesh.&#8221; As to the addition &#8220;this&#8221; see how consonant it is with all that we have cited from the divine books. What else does Job signify in the place which we explained above, &#8220;He will raise again my skin, which is now draining this cup of suffering,&#8221; that is, which is undergoing these torments? Does he not plainly say that there will be a resurrection of this flesh, this, I mean, which is now undergoing the extremity of trials and tribulations? Moreover, when the Apostle says, &#8220;This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3425"></A><A HREF="#fn_3425"><FONT SIZE="1">3426</FONT></A>
 are not his words those of one who in a manner touches his body and places his finger upon it? This body then, which is now corruptible, will by the grace of the resurrection be incorruptible, and this which is now mortal will be clothed with virtues of immortality, that, as &#8220;Christ rising from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over Him,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3426"></A><A HREF="#fn_3426"><FONT SIZE="1">3427</FONT></A>
 so those who shall rise in Christ shall never again feel corruption or death, <A NAME="page_562"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 562</FONT></A> <a name="vi.xiii.xlvi-Page_562"></A>not because the nature of flesh will have been cast off, but because its condition and quality will have been changed. There will be a body, therefore, which will rise from the dead incorruptible and immortal, not only of the righteous, but also of sinners; of the righteous that they may be able ever to abide with Christ, of sinners that they may undergo without end the punishment due to them.</p>
