id="iv.viii.v.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII</span>.—*Of John’s
boldness for God*.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.xxviii-p2.1"></span>When</span> the great John had
received the tiller of the Church, he boldly convicted certain wrong
doers, made seasonable exhortations to the emperor and empress, and
admonished the clergy to live according to the laws laid down.
Transgressors against these laws he forbade to approach the churches,
urging that they who shewed no desire to live the life of true priests
ought not to enjoy priestly honour. He acted with this care for the
church not only in Constantinople, but throughout the whole of Thrace,
which is divided into six provinces, and likewise of Asia, which is
governed by eleven governors. Pontica too, which has a like number of
rulers with Asia, was happily brought by him under the same
discipline. <span id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915)

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxviii-p3"></span> Valesius points out that those
commentators have been in error who have supposed Theodoretus to be
referring here to *ecclesiastical* divisions and officers.

<span id="iv.viii.v.xxviii-p4"></span>Chrysostom is here distinctly
described as asserting and exercising a jurisdiction over the civil
“diœceses” of Pontica, Asia, and Thrace. But the quasi patriarchate was
at this time only honorary. Only so late as at the recent council at
Constantinople (381) had its bishop, previously under the metropolitan
of Perinthus, been declared to rank next after the bishop of Rome, the
metropolitans of Alexandria and Antioch standing next, but it was not
till the Council of Chalcedon that the “diœceses” of Pontus, Asia, and
Thrace were formally subjected to the see of Constantinople.
