<span id="iv.x.xc-p1"></span> *XC. To Lupicinus the Master.* <span
id="fr_1798"></span>[1799](#fn_1798)

<span id="iv.x.xc-p3"></span>I have passed through the contests of my
prime. I see before me the confines of old age, and have expected as an
old man to have more honour given me. But I am a mark for the shafts of
slander, and am driven to meet by defence accusations levelled against
me. Under these circumstances, I beseech your excellency not to believe
the lies of my accusers. Had I been living a life of silence, there
might have been room for the suspicion of unorthodoxy. But I am
continually discoursing in the churches, and therefore have, by God’s
grace, innumerable witnesses to the soundness of what I teach. I follow
the laws and rules of the apostles. I test my teaching by applying to
it, like a rule and measure, the faith laid down by the holy and blessed
Fathers at Nicæa. If any one maintain that I hold any contrary opinion,
let him accuse me face to face; let him not slander me in my absence. It
is fair that even the defendant should have an opportunity of speech,
and meet with his defence the charges brought against him, and that then
and not till then should the judges lawfully pronounce their sentence.
This favour I beg <span id="page_284">p. 284</span> <span
id="iv.x.xc-Page_284"></span>through your excellency’s assistance. If
any men wish to condemn me unheard, I accept with willingness even their
unjust sentence. For I wait for the judgment of the Master, where we
need neither witnesses nor accusers. Before Him, as says the divine
Apostle, “all things are naked and opened.” <span

great state officers under the Constantinian constitution. He had
control over posts, police, arsenals, and the imperial correspondence
and, from his authority in the palace, was a kind of “comptroller,” or
“master of the household.” cf. Rufinus, p. 123.
