marvelous knowledge and in sanctity of life, in every respect worthy of
imitation, wrote many and very useful works for all who are hastening to
divine things. Among them are the following *On compunction of soul* one
book, *That no one is injured except by himself,* an excellent volume
*In praise of the blessed Paul the apostle, On the excesses and ill
reputation* of Eutropius a prætorian prefect and many others, as I have
said, which may be found by the industrious.\]
