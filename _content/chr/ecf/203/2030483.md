id="v.iii.cii-p2.1"></span>Hilary</span>, <span
id="fr_2526"></span>[2527](#fn_2526) a bishop of Poitiers in Aquitania,
was a member of the party of Saturninus bishop of Arles. Banished into
Phrygia by the Synod of Beziérs he composed twelve books *Against the
Arians* and another book *On Councils* written to the Gallican bishops,
and *Commentaries on the Psalms* that is on the first and second, from
the fifty-first to the sixty-second, and from the one hundred and
eighteenth to the end of the book. In this work he imitated Origen, but
added also some original matter. There is a little book of his *To
Constantius* which he presented to the emperor while he was living in
Constantinople, and another *On Constantius* which he wrote after his
death and a book *Against Valens and Ursacius,* containing a history of
the Ariminian and Selucian Councils and *To Sallust the prefect*
or*Against Dioscurus,* also a book of *Hymns and mysteries*, a
commentary *On Matthew* and treatises On *Job,* which he translated
freely from the Greek of Origen, and another elegant little work
*Against Auxentius* and*Epistles* to different persons. They say he has
written *On the Song of Songs* but this work is not known to us. He died
at Poictiers during the reign of Valentinianus and Valens.
