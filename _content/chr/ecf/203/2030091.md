id="iv.viii.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII</span>.—*Of the
confiscation of the sacred treasures and taking away of the
allowances*. <span id="fr_626"></span>[627](#fn_626)

<span id="iv.viii.iii.viii-p3"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.viii-p3.1"></span>Even</span> when the wicked had become
acquainted with these events they set themselves in array against the
God of all; and the prince ordered the holy vessels to be handed over to
the imperial treasury. Of the great church which Constantine had built
he nailed up the doors and declared it closed to the worshippers wont to
assemble there. At this time it was in possession of the Arians. In
company with Julianus the prefect of the East, Felix the imperial
treasurer, and Elpidius, who had charge of the emperor’s private purse
and property, an officer whom it is the Roman custom to call “Comes
privatarum,” <span id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627) made their way into
the sacred edifice. Both Felix and Elpidius, it is said, were
Christians, but to please the impious emperor apostatised from the true
religion. Julianus committed an act of gross indecency on the Holy
Table <span id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628) and, when Euzoius
endeavoured to prevent him, gave him a blow on the face, and told him,
so the story goes, that it is the fate of the fortunes of Christians to
have no protection from the gods. But Felix, as he gazed upon the
magnificence of the sacred vessels, furnished with splendour by the
munificence of Constantine and Constantius, “Behold,” said he, “with
what vessels Mary’s son is served.” But it was not long before they paid
the penalty of these deeds of mad and impious daring.

This deprivation is not further referred to in the text. Philostorgius
(vii. 4) says “He distributed the allowance of the churches among the
ministers of the dæmons,” cf. Soz. v. 5. The restitution is recorded in
Theod. iv. 4. The <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="iv.viii.iii.viii-p4"></span> By the constitution of
Constantine the two great ministers of finance were (i) the *Comes
sacrarum largitionum,* treasurer and paymaster of the public staff of
the Empire; (ii) *Comes rei privatæ,* who managed the privy purse and
kept the *liber beneficionum,* an account of privileges granted by the
emperor. cf. Dict. Christ. Ant. i. p. 634.

<span id="iv.viii.iii.viii-p5"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.viii-p5.1"></span>Τράπεζα</span> is the word commonly
employed by the Greek Fathers and in Greek Liturgies to designate the
Lord’s Table. <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.viii-p5.2"></span>Θυσιαστήριον</span> is used by
Eusebius H. E. x. 4, for the Altar of the Church of Tyre, but the
earlier <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.iii.viii-p5.3"></span>θυσιαστήριον</span> of Ignatius
(Philad. iv.) does not appear to mean the Lord’s Table. cf. Bp.
Lightfoot Ap. Fathers. pt. II. ii. p. 258.
