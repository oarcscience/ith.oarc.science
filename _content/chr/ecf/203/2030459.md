id="v.iii.lxxviii-p2.1"></span>Pierius</span>, <span
id="fr_2495"></span>[2496](#fn_2495) presbyter of the church at
Alexandria in the reign of Carus and Diocletian, at the time when
Theonas ruled as bishop in the same church, taught the people with great
success and attained such elegance of language and published so many
treatises on all sorts of subjects (which are still extant) that he was
called Origen Junior. He was remarkable for his self-discipline, devoted
to voluntary poverty, and thoroughly acquainted with the dialectic art.
After the <span id="page_378">p. 378</span> <span
id="v.iii.lxxviii-Page_378"></span>persecution, he passed the rest of
his life at Rome. There is extant a long treatise of his *On the prophet
Hosea* which from internal evidence appears to have been delivered on
the vigil of Passover.
