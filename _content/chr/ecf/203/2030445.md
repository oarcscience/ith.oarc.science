<span id="v.iii.lxiv-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.lxiv-p2.1"></span>Alexander</span>, <span
id="fr_2475"></span>[2476](#fn_2475) bishop of Cappadocia, desiring to
visit the Holy Land, came to Jerusalem, at the time when Narcissus,
bishop of this city, already an old man, ruled the church. It was
revealed to Narcissus and many of his clergy, that on the morning of the
next day, a bishop would enter the city, who should be assistant on the
sacerdotal throne. And so it came to pass, as it was predicted, and all
the bishops of Palestine being gathered together, Narcissus himself
being especially urgent, Alexander took with him the helm of the church
of Jerusalem. At the end of one of his epistles, written to the
Antinoites *On the peace of the church,* he says “Narcissus, who held
the bishopric here before me, and now with me exercises his office by
his prayers, being about a hundred and sixteen years old, salutes you,
and with me begs you to become of one mind.” He wrote another also *To
the Antiocheans,* by the hand of Clement, the presbyter of Alexandria,
of whom we spoke above, another also *To Origen,* and *In behalf of
Origen against Demetrius,* called forth by the fact that, according to
the testimony of Demetrius, he had made Origen presbyter. There are
other epistles of his to different persons. In the seventh persecution
under Decius, at the time when Babylas of Antioch was put to death,
brought to Cæsarea and shut up in prison, he received the crown of
martyrdom for confessing Christ.
