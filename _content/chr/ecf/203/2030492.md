id="fr_2538"></span>[2539](#fn_2538) of Alexandria, becoming blind while
very young, and therefore ignorant of the rudiments of learning,
displayed such a miracle of intelligence as to learn perfectly
dialectics and even geometry, sciences which especially require sight.
He wrote many admirable works: *Commentaries on all the Psalms,
Commentaries on the Gospels of Matthew and John, On the doctrines,* also
two books *Against the Arians,* and one book *On the Holy Spirit,* which
I translated in Latin, eighteen volumes *On Isaiah,* three books of
commentaries *On Hosea,* addressed to me, and five books *On Zechariah,*
written at my request, also commentaries *On Job,* and many other
things, to give an account of which would be a work of itself. <span

passed his eighty-third year.
