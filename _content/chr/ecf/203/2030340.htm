<p class="c46"><a name="iv.x.cli-p1"></A>  <i>CL. Letter of Theodoretus, Bishop of Cyrus, to Joannes, Bishop of Antioch.</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2151"></A><A HREF="#fn_2151"><FONT SIZE="1">2152</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.cli-p3"></A>I have been much distressed at reading the anathematisms which you have sent to request me to refute in writing, and to make plain to all their heretical sense. I have been distressed at the thought that one appointed to the shepherd&#146;s office, entrusted with the charge of so great a flock and appointed to heal the sick among his sheep, is both himself unsound, and that to a terrible degree, and is endeavouring to infect his lambs with his disease and treats the sheep of his folds with greater cruelty than that of wild beasts. They, indeed, tear and rend the sheep that are dispersed and separated from the flock; but he in its very midst, and while thought to be its saviour and its guardian introduces secret error among the victims of their confidence in him. Against an open assault it is possible to take precautions, but when an attack is made in the guise of friendship, its victim is found off his guard and hurt is easily done him. Hence foes who make war from within are far more dangerous than those who attack from without.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.cli-p4"></A>I am yet more grieved that it should be in the name of true religion and with the dignity of a shepherd that he should give utterance to his heretical and blasphemous words, and renew that vain and impious teaching of Apollinarius which was long ago stamped out. Besides all this there is the fact that he not only supports these views but even dares to anathematize those who decline to participate in his blasphemies;&#8212;if he is really the author of these productions and they have not proceeded from some enemy of the truth who has composed them in his name and, as the old story has it, flung the apple of discord&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2152"></A><A HREF="#fn_2152"><FONT SIZE="1">2153</FONT></A>
 in the midst, and so fanned the flame on high.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.cli-p6"></A>But whether this composition comes from himself or from some other in his name, I, for my part, by the aid of the light of the Holy Ghost, in the investigation of this heretical and corrupt opinion, according to the measure of the power given me, have refuted them as best I could. I have confronted them with the teaching of evangelists and apostles. I have exposed the monstrosity of the doctrine, and proved how vast is its divergence from divine truth. This I have done by comparing it with the words of the Holy Spirit, and pointing out what strange and jarring discord there is between it and the divine.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.cli-p7"></A>Against the hardihood of this anathema<A NAME="page_325"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 325</FONT></A> <a name="iv.x.cli-Page_325"></A>tizing, thus much I will say, that Paul, the clear-voiced herald of truth, anathematized those who had corrupted the evangelic and apostolic teaching and boldly did so against the angels, not against those who abided by the laws laid down by theologians; these he strengthened with blessings, saying, &#8220;And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them and mercy and on the Israel of God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2153"></A><A HREF="#fn_2153"><FONT SIZE="1">2154</FONT></A>
 Let then the author of these writings reap from the Apostle&#146;s curse the due rewards of his labours and the harvest of his seeds of heresy. We will abide in the teaching of the holy Fathers.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.cli-p9"></A>To this letter I have appended my counter arguments, that on reading them you may judge whether I have effectively destroyed the heretical propositions. Setting down each of the anathematisms by itself, I have annexed the counter statement that readers may easily understand, and that the refutation of the dogmas may be clear.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2154"></A><A HREF="#fn_2154"><FONT SIZE="1">2155</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.x.cli-p2"></A> This letter may be dated in February 431. Celestine and Cyril had written to John of Antioch in relation to the condemnation of Nestorius by the western bishops at Rome in August 430. Theodoret was at Antioch on the arrival of these letters and hence additional probability is given to the theory that he wrote the reply referred to in the preceding note. Then came the publication of Cyril&#146;s chapter or anathemas which Theodoret undertook to refute. Letter CL. is prefixed to his remarks on them.</p>
