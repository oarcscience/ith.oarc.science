<A HREF="2030775.htm">A criticism on Rufinus' Apology to Anastasius. His excuses for not coming to Rome are absurd. His parents are dead and the journey is easy. No one ever heard before of his being imprisoned or exiled for the faith.</A><BR>

<A HREF="2030777.htm">His confession of faith is unsatisfactory. No one asked him about the Trinity, but about Origen's doctrines of the Resurrection, the origin of souls, and the salvability of Satan. As to the Resurrection and to Satan he is ambiguous. As to souls he professes ignorance.</A><BR>

<A HREF="2030786.htm">Origen asserts Christ to be a creature, and maintains universal restitution. Where has he contradicted this?</A><BR>
<A HREF="2030787.htm">The question is, as Anastasius says to John of Jerusalem, with what motive you translated the &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#8125;&#913;&#961;&#967;&#8182;&#957;.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2030788.htm">You pretend not to be Origen's defender, but you publish and enlarge the Apology for him and allege the heretics' falsification of his works.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2030789.htm">Your defence gains no support from Eusebius or Didymus, who, each for his own reason, defend the &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#8125;&#913;&#961;&#967;&#8182;&#957; as it stands.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2030790.htm">If we may allege falsification at every turn we make a chaos of all past literature.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2030791.htm">The object of Origen's letter, of which he translates only a part, is not to shew the falsification of his writings but to vituperate the Bishops who condemned him.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2030792.htm">It is only in reference to a particular point in his dispute with Candidus that Origen alleges this falsification. The story of Hilary's being condemned through his writings having been falsified has no foundation.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2030793.htm">That which you tell about myself in Damasus' council is mere after-dinner gossip.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2030794.htm">The attack on Epiphanius as a plagiarist of Origen is an outrage on the Bishops generally. Origen never wrote 6000 books.</A><BR>

<A HREF="2030813.htm">The assertion that you had only two days for your answer is a fiction.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2030814.htm">Your translation, contrariwise to my Commentaries, vouches for the soundness of Origen.</A><BR>

<A HREF="2030820.htm">You speak of the Egyptian Bishop Paul. We received him, though an Origenist, as a stranger; and he has united himself to the orthodox faith. Not only Theophilus but the Emperors condemn Origen.</A><BR>

<A HREF="2030826.htm">Epiphanius, it is true, gave you the kiss of peace; but he showed afterwards that he had come to distrust you.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2030827.htm">When we parted as friends I believed you a true believer; no one was sent to Rome to injure you.</A><BR>

<A HREF="2030831.htm">My ignorance of many natural phenomena is no excuse for your ignorance as to the origin of souls. You ought, according to your boasting dream to know everything. The thing of most importance was forgotten in your cargo of Eastern wares.</A><BR>
