<span id="iv.x.xxxviii-p1"></span> *XXXVIII. Festal.*

<span id="iv.x.xxxviii-p2"></span>The divine feast of salvation has
brought us the founts of God’s good gifts, the blessing of the Cross,
and the immortality which sprang from our Lord’s death, the resurrection
of our Lord Jesus Christ which gives promise of the resurrection of us
all. These being the gifts of the feast, such its exhibition of the
bounty of divine grace, it has filled us with spiritual gladness. But
encompassed as we are on every side by many and <span id="page_263">p.
263</span> <span id="iv.x.xxxviii-Page_263"></span>great calamities, the
brightness of the feast is dimmed, and lamentation and wailing are
mingled with our psalmody. Such sorrows does sin bring forth. It is sin
which has filled our life with pangs; it is on account of sin that death
is lovelier to us than life; it is on account of sin that when we think
in imagination of that incorruptible tribunal we shudder even at the
life to come. So may your piety pray that God’s loving-kindness may
light on us, and that this gloomy and terrible cloud may be dispersed
and sunshine again quickly give us joy.
