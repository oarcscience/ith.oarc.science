<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.xxxvi-p1"></A>  35. <span class="c14"><a name="vi.xiii.xxxvi-p1.1"></A>And in the Holy Ghost</span>. What has been delivered above somewhat at large concerning Christ relates to the mystery of His Incarnation and of His Passion, and, by thus intervening, as belonging to His Person, has somewhat delayed the mention of the Holy Spirit. Otherwise, if the divine nature alone be taken into account, as in the beginning of the Creed we say &#8220;I believe in God the Father Almighty,&#8221; and afterwards, &#8220;In Jesus Christ His only Son our Lord,&#8221; so in like manner we add, &#8220;And in the Holy Ghost.&#8221; But all of these particulars which are spoken of above concerning Christ relate, as we have said, to the dispensation of the flesh (to His Incarnation). By the mention of the Holy Spirit, the mystery of the Trinity is completed. For as one Father is mentioned, and there is no other Father, and one only-begotten Son is mentioned, and there is no other only-begotten Son, so also there is one Holy Ghost, and there cannot be another Holy Ghost. In order, therefore, that the Persons may be distinguished, the terms expressing relationship (the properties) are varied, whereby the first is understood to be the Father, of Whom are all things, Who Himself also hath no Father, the second the Son, as born of the Father, and the third the Holy Ghost, as proceeding from both,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3402"></A><A HREF="#fn_3402"><FONT SIZE="1">3403</FONT></A>
 and sanctifying all things. But that in the Trinity one and the same Godhead may be set forth, since, prefixing the preposition &#8220;in&#8221; we say that we believe &#8220;<i>in</i> God the Father,&#8221; so also we say, &#8220;<i>in</i> Christ His Son,&#8221; so also &#8220;<i>in</i> the Holy Ghost.&#8221; But our meaning will be made more plain in what follows. For the Creed proceeds,&#8212;</p>
