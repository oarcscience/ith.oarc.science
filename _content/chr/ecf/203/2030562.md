id="fr_2645"></span>[2646](#fn_2645) </span> bishop of Bologna in
Italy <span id="fr_2646"></span>[2647](#fn_2646) a man of holy life and
from his youth practised in monastic studies, is reputed to have written
the *Lives of the Fathers,* to wit of the Egyptian monks, a work which
the monks accept as the mirror and pattern of their profession. I have
read a treatise which bears his name *On the ordination of bishops,* a
work full of good reasoning and notable for its humility, but whose
polished style shows it not to have been his, but perhaps, as some say,
the work of his father Petronius, <span
id="fr_2647"></span>[2648](#fn_2647) a man of great eloquence and
learned in secular literature. This I think is to be accepted, for the
author of the work describes himself as a prætorian prefect. He died in
the reign of Theodosius and Valentinianus.
