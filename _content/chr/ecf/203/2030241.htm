<p class="c46"><a name="iv.x.lii-p1"></A>  <i>LII. To Ibas, Bishop of Edessa</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1697"></A><A HREF="#fn_1697"><FONT SIZE="1">1698</FONT></A>

<p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.lii-p3"></A>It is, I think, of His providential care for our common salvation that the God of all brings on some men certain calamities, that chastisement may prove to be to them that have erred a healing remedy; to virtue&#146;s athletes an encouragement to constancy; and to all who look on a beneficial exemplar. For it is natural that when we see others punished we should be filled with fear ourselves. In view of these considerations I look on the trouble of Africa as a general advantage. In the first place when I bear in mind their former prosperity and now look on their sudden overthrow, I see how variable are all human affairs, and learn a twofold lesson;&#8212;not to rejoice in felicity as though it would never come to an end, nor be distressed at calamities as hard to bear. Then I recall the memory of past errors, and tremble lest I fall into like sufferings. My main motive in now writing to you is to introduce to your holiness the very God-<A NAME="page_267"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 267</FONT></A> <a name="iv.x.lii-Page_267"></A>beloved bishop Cyprianus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1698"></A><A HREF="#fn_1698"><FONT SIZE="1">1699</FONT></A>
 who starting from the famous Africa is now compelled, by the savagery of the barbarians, to travel in foreign lands.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.lii-p5"></A>He has brought a letter to us from the very holy bishop the lord Eusebius,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1699"></A><A HREF="#fn_1699"><FONT SIZE="1">1700</FONT></A>
 who wisely rules the Galatians. When your piety has received him with your wonted kindness I beg you to send him with a letter to whatever pious bishops you may think fit so that while he enjoys their kindly consolation he may be the means of their receiving heavenly and lasting benefits.</p>
