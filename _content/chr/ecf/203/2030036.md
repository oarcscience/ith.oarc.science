<span id="iv.viii.i.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV</span>.—*The Epistle of
Constantine concerning the preparation of copies of the Holy
Scriptures*.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xvi-p2"></span>“<span class="c14"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xvi-p2.1"></span>Constantinus Augustus</span>, the great
and the victorious, to Eusebius.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xvi-p3"></span>“In the city <span
id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387) which bears our name, a great number
of persons have, through the providential care of God the Saviour,
united themselves to the holy Church. As all things there are in a state
of rapid improvement, we deemed it most important that an additional
number of churches should be built. Adopt joyfully the mode of procedure
determined upon by us, which we have thought expedient to make known to
your prudence, namely, that you should get written, on fine parchment,
fifty volumes <span id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388) , easily legible
and handy for use; these you must have transcribed by skilled
calligraphers, accurately acquainted with their art. I mean, of course,
copies of the Holy Scriptures, which, as you know, it is most necessary
that the congregation of the Church should both have and use. A letter
has been sent from our clemency to the catholicus <span
id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389) of the diocese, in order that he may
be careful that everything necessary for the undertaking is supplied.
The duty devolving upon you is to take measures to ensure the completion
of these manuscripts within a short space of time. When they are
finished, you are authorised by this letter to order two public
carriages for the purpose of transmitting them to us; and thus the fair
manuscripts will be easily submitted to our inspection. Appoint one of
the deacons of your church to take charge of this part of the business;
when he comes to us, he shall receive proofs of our benevolence. May God
preserve you, beloved brother.”

<span id="iv.viii.i.xvi-p7"></span>What has been already said is enough
to shew, nay to clearly prove, how great zeal the emperor manifested on
the matters of religion. I will, however, add his noble acts with regard
to the Sepulchre of our Saviour. For having learnt that the idolaters,
in their frantic rage, had heaped earth over the Lord’s tomb, eager thus
to destroy all remembrance of His Salvation, and had built over it a
temple to the goddess of unbridled lust, in mockery of the Virgin’s
birth, the emperor ordered the foul shrine to be demolished, and the
soil polluted with abominable sacrifices to be carried away <span
id="page_54">p. 54</span> <span id="iv.viii.i.xvi-Page_54"></span>and
thrown out far from the city, and a new temple of great size and beauty
to be erected on the site. All this is clearly set forth in the letter
which he wrote to the president <span id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390)
of the church of Jerusalem, Macarius, whom we have already mentioned as
a member of the great Nicene Council, and united with his brethren in
withstanding the blasphemies of Arius. The following is the letter.
