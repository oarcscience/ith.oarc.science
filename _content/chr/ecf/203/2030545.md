id="v.iv.xxvi-p2.1"></span>Sabbatius</span>, <span
id="fr_2615"></span>[2616](#fn_2615) bishop of the Gallican province, at
the request of a certain virgin, chaste and devoted to Christ, Secunda
by name, composed a book *On faith* against Marcion and Valentinus his
teacher, also <span id="page_391">p. 391</span> <span
id="v.iv.xxvi-Page_391"></span>against Eunomius and his Master Aëtius,
showing, both by reason and by testimony of the Scriptures, that the
origin of the deity is one, that the Author of his eternity and the
Creator of the earth out of nothing, are one and the same, and likewise
concerning Christ, that he did not appear as man in a phantasm but had
real flesh through which eating, drinking, weary and weeping, suffering,
dying, rising again he was demonstrated to be man indeed. For Marcion
and Valentinus had been opposed to these opinions asserting that the
origin of Deity is twofold and that Christ came in a phantasm. To Aëtius
indeed and Eunomius his disciple, he showed that the Father and Son are
not of two natures and equal in divinity but of one essence and the one
from the other, that is the Son from the Father, the one coeternal with
the other, which belief Aëtius and Eunomius opposed.
