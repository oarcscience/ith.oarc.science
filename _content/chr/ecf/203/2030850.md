<span id="vi.xiii.ii"></span>

<span id="vi.xiii.ii-p1"></span>My mind has as little inclination for
writing as sufficiency, most faithful Bishop(*Papa*) Laurentius, <span
id="fr_3254"></span>[3255](#fn_3254) for I well know that it is a matter
of no little peril to submit a slender ability to general criticism.
But, since in your letter you rashly (forgive my saying so) require me,
by Christ’s sacraments, which I hold in the greatest reverence, to
compose something for you concerning the Faith, in accordance with the
traditional and natural meaning of the Creed, although in so doing you
impose a burthen upon me beyond my strength to bear (for I do not forget
the opinion of the wise, which so justly says, that “to speak of God
even what is true is perilous”); still, if you will aid with your
prayers the necessity which your requisition has laid upon me, I will
try to say something, moved rather by a reverential regard for your
injunction than by presumptuous confidence in my ability. What I write,
however, will hardly seem worthy of the consideration of persons of
mature understanding, but suited rather to the capacity of children and
young beginners in Christ.

<span id="vi.xiii.ii-p3"></span>I find, indeed, that some eminent
writers have published treatises on these matters piously and briefly
written. Moreover, I know that the heretic Photinus has written on the
same; but with the object, not of explaining the meaning of the text to
his readers, but of wresting things simply and truthfully said in
support of his own dogma, while yet the Holy Spirit has taken care that
in these words nothing should be set down which is ambiguous or obscure,
or inconsistent with other truths: for therein is that prophecy
verified, “Finishing and cutting short the word in equity: because a
short word will the Lord make upon the earth.” <span
id="fr_3255"></span>[3256](#fn_3255) It shall be our endeavour, then,
first to restore and emphasize the words of the Apostles in their native
simplicity; and, secondly, to supply such things as seem to have been
omitted by former expositors. But that the scope of this “short word,”
as we have called it, may be made more plain, we will enquire from the
beginning how it came to be given to the Churches.

<span id="vi.xiii.ii-p2"></span> Nothing is known of this Pope
Laurentius. The title “Papa,” at first given to Bishops promiscuously,
was not yet restricted to the Bishop of Rome. Gregory VII., in a Council
held at Rome in 1073, forbade it to be given to any other.
