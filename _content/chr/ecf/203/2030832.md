<span id="vi.xii.iii.xxx-p1"></span> 29. You press me to give my
opinions about the nature of things. If there were room, I could repeat
to you the views of Lucretius who follows Epicurus, or those of
Aristotle as taught by the Peripatetics, or of Plato and Zeno by the
Academics and the Stoics. Passing to the church, where we have the rule
of truth, the books of Genesis and the Prophets and Ecclesiastes, give
us much information on questions of this kind. But if we profess
ignorance about all these things, as also about the origin of souls, you
ought in your Apology to acknowledge your ignorance of all alike, and to
ask your calumniators why they had the impudence to force you to reply
on this single point when they themselves know nothing of all those
great matters. But Oh! how vast was the wealth contained in that
trireme <span id="fr_3187"></span>[3188](#fn_3187) which had come full
of all the wares of Egypt and the East to enrich the poverty of the city
of Rome.

<span id="vi.xii.iii.xxx-p3"></span> <span
id="fr_3188"></span>[3189](#fn_3188) “Thou art that hero, well-nam’d
Maximus,

<span id="vi.xii.iii.xxx-p5"></span>Thou who alone by writing sav’st the
state.”

<span id="vi.xii.iii.xxx-p6"></span>Unless you had come from the East,
that very learned man would be still sticking fast among the
mathematici, <span id="fr_3189"></span>[3190](#fn_3189) and all
Christians would still be ignorant of what might be said against
fatalism. You have a right to ply me with questions about astrology and
the cause of the sky and the stars, when you brought to land a ship full
of such wares as these. I acknowledge my poverty; I have not grown rich
to this extent in the East like you. You learned in your long sojourn
under the shadow of the Pharos what Rome never knew: Egypt instructed
you in lore which Italy did not possess till now.

[Next: My ignorance of many natural phenomena is no excuse for your
ignorance as to the origin of souls. You ought, according to your
boasting dream to know everything. The thing of most importance was
forgotten in your cargo of Eastern wares.](2030833)
