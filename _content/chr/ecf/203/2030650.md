<span id="vi.xi.ii.xiii-p1"></span> 12. But I wrote a Preface <span
id="fr_2839"></span>[2840](#fn_2839) to each of these works, and in
both, but especially in the Preface to the work of Pamphilus, which was
translated first, I set in the forefront an exposition of my faith,
affirming that my belief is in accordance with the catholic faith; and I
stated that whatever men might find in the original or in my
translation, my share in it in no way implicated my own faith, and
further, in reference to the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xi.ii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Περὶ ᾽Αρχῶν</span> I gave this warning. I
had found that in these books some things relating to the faith were set
forth in a catholic sense, just as the Church proclaims them, while in
other places, when the very same thing is in question, expressions of a
contrary kind are used. I had thought it right to set forth these points
in the way in which the author had set them forth when he had propounded
the catholic view of them: on the other hand, when I found things which
were contrary to the author’s real opinion, I looked on them as things
inserted by others, (for he witnesses by the complaints contained in his
letter that this has been done), and therefore rejected them, or at all
events considered that I might omit them as having none of the “godly
edifying in the faith.” It will not, I think, be considered superfluous
to insert these passages from my Prefaces, so that proof may be at hand
for each statement. And further, to prevent the reader from falling into
any mistake as to the passages which I insert from other documents, I
have, where the quotation is from my own works, placed a single mark
against the passage, but, where the words are those of my opponent, a
double mark. <span id="fr_2840"></span>[2841](#fn_2840)
