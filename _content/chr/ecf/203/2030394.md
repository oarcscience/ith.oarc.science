<span id="v.iii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Philo <span
id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390) </span> the Jew, an Alexandrian of
the priestly class, is placed by us among the ecclesiastical writers on
the ground that, writing a book concerning the first church of Mark the
evangelist at Alexandria, he writes to our praise, declaring not only
that they were there, but also that they were in many provinces and
calling their habitations monasteries. From this <span
id="fr_2391"></span>[2392](#fn_2391) it appears that the church of those
that believed in Christ at first, was such as now the monks desire to
imitate, <span id="fr_2392"></span>[2393](#fn_2392) that is, such that
nothing is the peculiar property of any one of them, none of them rich,
none poor, that patrimonies are divided among the needy, that they have
leisure for prayer and psalms, for doctrine also and ascetic practice,
that they were in fact as Luke declares believers were at first at
Jerusalem. They say that under Caius <span
id="fr_2393"></span>[2394](#fn_2393) Caligula he ventured to Rome,
whither he had been sent as legate of his nation, and that when a second
time he had come to Claudius, he spoke in the same city with the apostle
Peter and enjoyed his friendship, and for this reason also adorned the
adherents of Mark, Peter’s disciple at Alexandria, with his praises.
There are distinguished and innumerable works by this man: *On the five
books of Moses,* one book *Concerning the confusion of tongues,* one
book *On nature and invention,* one book *On the things which our senses
desire and we detest,* one book *On learning,* one book *On the heir of
divine things,* one book *On the division of equals and contraries,* one
book *On the three virtues,* one book *On why in Scripture the names of
many persons are changed,* two books *On covenants,* one book *On the
life of a wise man,* one book *Concerning giants,* five books *That
dreams are sent by God,* five books of *Questions and answers on
Exodus,* four books *On the tabernacle and the Decalogue,* as well as
books *On victims and promises or curses, On Providence, On the Jews, On
the manner of one’s life, On Alexander,* and *That dumb beasts have
right reason,* and *That every fool should be a slave,* and *On the
lives of the Christians,* of which we spoke above, that is, lives of
apostolic men, which also he entitled, *On those who practice the divine
life,* because in truth they contemplate divine things and ever pray to
God, also under other categories, two *On agriculture,* two *On
drunkenness.* There are other monuments of his genius which have not
come to our hands. Concerning him there is a proverb among the Greeks
“Either Plato philonized, or Philo platonized,” that is, either Plato
followed Philo, or Philo, Plato, so great is the similarity of ideas and
language.
