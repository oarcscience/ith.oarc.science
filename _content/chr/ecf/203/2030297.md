<span id="iv.x.cviii-p1"></span> *CVIII. To Acacius the Presbyter.*

<span id="iv.x.cviii-p2"></span>True indeed is the promise of David’s
Psalm, for through him the Spirit of truth gave this promise to them
that believe, “Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also to him; and he
shall bring it to pass; and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as
the light and thy judgment as the noonday.” <span
id="fr_1842"></span>[1843](#fn_1842) This we find too has come to pass
in the case of your piety. For the great care you bestow upon them that
are weeping for their orphanhood, and your struggles on behalf of the
apostolic doctrines, are in every one’s mouth, and so, as the prophets
say, “Hidden things are made manifest.” Since I too have heard of your
piety’s admirable exertions I write to salute you, most godly sir, and
beseech you to increase your glory by adding to your labours, and to
fight on behalf of the doctrine of the Gospels, that we may both keep
the inheritance of our fathers unimpaired, and bring our Master His
talent with good usury. <span id="fr_1843"></span>[1844](#fn_1843)
