 presbyter of the church at Aquileia, was not the least among the doctors of the church and had a fine talent for elegant translation from Greek into Latin. In this way he opened to the Latin speaking church the greater part of the Greek literature; translating the works of Basil of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia, Gregory Nazianzan, that most eloquent man, the <i>Recognitions</i> of Clement of Rome, the <i>Church history</i> of Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea in Palestine, the <i>Sentences</i> of Xystus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2599"></A><A HREF="#fn_2599"><FONT SIZE="1">2600</FONT></A>
 the <i>Sentences</i> of Evagrius and the work of Pamphilus Martyr <i>Against the mathematicians.</i> Whatever among all these which are read by the Latins have prefatory matter, have been translated by Rufinus, but those which are without Prologue have been translated by some one else who did not choose to write a prologue. Not all of Origen, however, is his work, for Jerome translated some which are identified by his prologue. On his own account, the same Rufinus, ever through the grace of God published an <i>Exposition of the Apostles&#146; creed</i> so excellent that other expositions are regarded as of no account in comparison. He also wrote in a threefold sense, that is, the historical, moral and mystical sense, on Jacob&#146;s blessing on the patriarchs. He wrote also many epistles exhorting to fear of God, among which those which he addressed to Proba are pre&euml;minent. He added also a tenth and eleventh book to the ecclesiastical history which we have said was written by Eusebius and translated by him. Moreover he responded to a detractor of his works, in two volumes, arguing and proving that he exercised his talent with the aid of the Lord and in the sight of God, for the good of the church, while he, on the other hand, incited by jealousy had taken to polemics.</p>
