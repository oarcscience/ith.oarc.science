<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.xlviii-p1"></A>  47. Nor let this promise seem to you contrary to the natural structure of the body. For if we believe, according to what is written, that God took clay of the earth and made man, and that the origin of our body was this, that, by the will of God, earth was changed into flesh, why does it seem absurd to you or contrary to reason if, on the same principles on which earth is said to be advanced to all animal body, an animal body in turn should be believed to be advanced to a spiritual body? These things and many like these you will find in the divine Scriptures concerning the resurrection of the righteous. There will be given to sinners also, as we said above, a condition of incorruption and immortality at the resurrection, that, as God assigns this state to the righteous for perpetuity of glory, so He may assign the same to sinners for prolongation of confusion and punishment. For this also the Prophet&#146;s words, which we referred to above, state clearly: &#8220;Many shall rise from the dust of the earth, some to life eternal, and others to confusion and eternal shame.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3432"></A><A HREF="#fn_3432"><FONT SIZE="1">3433</FONT></A>
