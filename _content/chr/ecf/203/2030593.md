id="v.iv.lxxiv-p2.1"></span>Timotheus, <span
id="fr_2696"></span>[2697](#fn_2696) </span>  <span
id="fr_2697"></span>[2698](#fn_2697) when Proterius <span
id="fr_2698"></span>[2699](#fn_2698) had been put to death by the
Alexandrians, in response to popular clamour, willingly or unwillingly
allowed himself to be made bishop by a single bishop in the place of him
who had been put to death. And lest he, having been illegally appointed,
should be deservedly deposed at the will of the people who had hated
Proterius, he pronounced all the bishops of his vicinity to be
Nestorians, and boldly presuming to wash out the stain on his conscience
by hardihood, wrote a very persuasive book to the Emperor Leo, which he
attempted to fortify by testimonies of the Fathers, used in a perverted
sense, so far as to show, for the sake of deceiving the emperor and
establishing his heresy, that Leo of Rome, pontiff of the city, and the
synod of Chalcedon, and all the Western bishops were fundamentally
Nestorians. But by the grace of God, the enemy of the church was refuted
and overthrown at the Council of Chalcedon. He is said to be living in
exile, still an heresiarch, <span id="page_398">p. 398</span> <span
id="v.iv.lxxiv-Page_398"></span>and it is most likely so. This book of
his for learning’s sake, I translated by request of the brethren into
Latin and prefixed a caveat. <span id="fr_2699"></span>[2700](#fn_2699)
