<span id="v.ii.iii-p1"></span> 3. *Manuscripts*.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p2"></span>The manuscripts of Jerome and Gennadius
are numerous. The translator has seen 84 <span class="c14"><span
id="v.ii.iii-p2.1"></span>mss.</span> of Jerome and 57 of Gennadius and
has certain memoranda of at least 25 more and hints of still another
score. It is certainly within bounds to say that there are more than 150
<span class="c14"><span id="v.ii.iii-p2.2"></span>mss.</span> of Jerome
extant and not less than 100 of Gennadius.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p3"></span>The oldest of those examined (and all the
oldest of which he could learn were seen) are at Rome, Verona, Vercelli,
Montpellier, Paris, Munich and Vienna.
