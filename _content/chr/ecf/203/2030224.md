<span id="iv.x.xxxv-p1"></span> *XXXV. To the Bishop Irenæus.* <span
id="fr_1674"></span>[1675](#fn_1674)

<span id="iv.x.xxxv-p3"></span>You are conspicuous, my Lord, for many
forms of goodness, and your holiness is beautified in an especial degree
by loving-kindness, by contempt of riches, and by a generosity that
gushes forth for the help of them that need. I know too that you deem
worthy of more than ordinary attention those who have been brought up in
prosperity and have fallen from it into trouble. Knowing this as well as
I do I venture to make known to you the very admirable and excellent
Celestinianus. He was once well known in Carthage for wealth and
position, now stripped of these he is favourably known by his piety and
philosophy, for he bears what men call misfortune with resignation
because it has brought him to the salvation of his soul. He came to me
with a letter which described his former prosperity, and after he had
passed several days with me I proved the truth of what was said of him
by experience. I have therefore no hesitation in commending him to your
Holiness, and begging you to make him known to the well-to-do men of the
city. It is probable that when they have learnt what has befallen him,
in fear of a like fate befalling themselves, they will endeavour to
escape judgment by shewing mercy. He has no resource but to go about
begging, as he is put to the greater expense because he has with him his
wife and children, and the domestics who with him escaped the violence
of the barbarians.
