<span id="iv.x.xxvii-p1"></span> *XXVII. To Aquilinus, Deacon and
Archimandrite.*

<span id="iv.x.xxvii-p2"></span>No one who has won the divine adoption
weeps for orphanhood, for what guardian care can be more powerful than
that of our Father which is on high, because of Him fathers of earth are
fathers. By His will some are made fathers by nature, some by grace. To
Him then let us hold fast and keep alive the memory of them that are
dead. For we shall be the better for the recollection of them that have
lived well, rousing us to imitation of them.
