<span id="vi.xiii.xv-p1"></span> 14. <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xiii.xv-p1.1"></span>He Was Crucified Under Pontius Pilate and
Was Buried: He Descended into Hell</span>. The Apostle Paul teaches us
that we ought to have “the eyes of our understand<span id="page_549">p.
549</span> <span id="vi.xiii.xv-Page_549"></span>ing enlightened” <span
id="fr_3282"></span>[3283](#fn_3282) “that we may understand what is the
height and breadth and depth.” <span
id="fr_3283"></span>[3284](#fn_3283) “The height and breadth and depth”
is a description of the Cross, of which that part which is fixed in the
earth he calls the depth, the height that which is erected upon the
earth and reaches upward, the breadth that which is spread out to the
right hand and to the left. Since, therefore, there are so many kinds of
death by which it is given to men to depart this life, why does the
Apostle wish us to have our understanding enlightened so as to know the
reason why, of all of them, the Cross was chosen in preference for the
death of the Saviour. We must know, then, that that Cross was a triumph.
It was a signal trophy. A triumph is a token of victory over an enemy.
Since then Christ, when He came, brought three kingdoms at once into
subjection under His sway (for this He signifies when he says, “That in
the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things
on earth, and things under the earth”), <span
id="fr_3284"></span>[3285](#fn_3284) and conquered all of these by His
death, a death was sought answerable to the mystery, so that being
lifted up in the air, and subduing the powers of the air, He might make
a display of His victory over these supernatural and celestial powers.
Moreover the holy Prophet says that “all the day long He stretched out
His hands” <span id="fr_3285"></span>[3286](#fn_3285) to the people on
the earth, that He might both make protestation to unbelievers and
invite believers: finally, by that part which is sunk under the earth,
He signified His bringing into subjection to Himself the kingdoms of the
nether world.
