into the heresy which denies that Christ existed before the incarnation.
Set right by Origen, he wrote various short works, especially letters,
in which he thanks Origen. The letters of Origen to him, are also
extant, and a dialogue between Origen and Beryllus as well, in which
heresies are discussed. He was distinguished during the reign of
Alexander, son of Mammaea, and Maximinus and Gordianus, who succeeded
him in power.
