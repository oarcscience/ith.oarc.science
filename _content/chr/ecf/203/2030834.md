<span id="vi.xii.iii.xxxii-p1"></span> 31. Another part of my ‘smoke’
which <span id="page_535">p. 535</span> <span
id="vi.xii.iii.xxxii-Page_535"></span>you frequently laugh at is my
pretence, as you say, to know what I do not know, and the parade I make
of great teachers to deceive the common and ignorant people. You, of
course, are a man not of smoke but of flame, or rather of lightning; you
fulminate when you speak; you cannot contain the flames which have been
conceived within your mouth, and like Barchochebas, <span
id="fr_3193"></span>[3194](#fn_3193) the leader of the revolt of the
Jews, who used to hold in his month a lighted straw and blow it out so
as to appear to be breathing forth flame: so you also, like a second
Salmoneus, <span id="fr_3194"></span>[3195](#fn_3194) brighten the whole
path on which you tread, and reproach us as mere men of smoke, to whom
perhaps the words might be applied, <span
id="fr_3195"></span>[3196](#fn_3195) “Thou touchest the hills and they
smoke.” You do not understand the allusion of the Prophet <span
id="fr_3196"></span>[3197](#fn_3196) when he speaks of the smoke of the
locusts; it is no doubt the beauty of your eyes which makes it
impossible for you to bear the pungency of our smoke.
