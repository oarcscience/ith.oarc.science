<span id="vi.xii.i.xxxiii"></span>

<span id="vi.xii.i.xxxiii-p1"></span> 32. I am told, to take another
point, that one of his followers, Chrysogonus, finds fault with me for
having said that in baptism all sins are put away, <span
id="fr_3076"></span>[3077](#fn_3076) and, in the case of the man who was
twice married, that he had died and risen up a new man in Christ; and
further that there were several such persons who were Bishops in the
churches. I will make him a short answer. He and his friends have in
their hands my letter, for which they take me to task. Let him give an
answer to it, let him overthrow its reasoning by reasoning of his own,
and prove my writings false by his writings. Why should he knit his brow
and draw in and wrinkle up his nostrils, and weigh out his hollow words,
and simulate among the common crowd a sanctity which his conduct belies?
Let me proclaim my principles once more in his ears: That the old Adam
dies completely in the laver of baptism, and a new man rises then with
Christ; that the man that is earthly perishes and the man from heaven is
raised up. I say this not because I myself have a special interest in
this question, through the mercy of Christ; but that I made answer to my
brethren when they asked me for my opinion, not intending to prescribe
for others what they may think right to believe, nor to overturn their
resolution by my opinion. For we who lie hid in our cells do not covet
the Bishop’s office. We are not like some, who, despising all humility,
are eager to buy the episcopate with gold; nor do we wish, with the
minds of rebels, to suppress the Pontiff chosen by God; <span
id="fr_3077"></span>[3078](#fn_3077) nor do we, by favouring heretics,
show that we are heretics ourselves. As for money, we neither have it
nor desire to have it. <span id="fr_3078"></span>[3079](#fn_3078)
“Having food and clothing, we are therewith content;” and meanwhile we
constantly chant the words describing the man who shall ascend to the
hill of the Lord: <span id="fr_3079"></span>[3080](#fn_3079) “He that
putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the
innocent; he who doeth these things shall not be moved eternally.” We
may add that he who does the opposite to these will fall eternally.

<span id="vi.xii.i.xxxiii-p6"></span>————————————

<span id="vi.xii.i.xxxiii-p7"></span>Almost every sentence in this last
chapter is an insidious allusion to Rufinus. His “wrinkled-up brow” and
“turned-up nose,” his weighing out his words, his supposed wealth, are
all alluded to in other places and especially in the satirical
description of him given after his death in Jerome’s letter (cxxv. c.
18) to Rusticus.

<span id="vi.xii.i.xxxiii-p2"></span> The allusion is to Jerome’s letter
(LXIX) to Oceanus on the case of Carterius a Spanish Bishop, who had
been married before his baptism, and, his wife having died, had married
again. Oceanus argued that he was to be condemned. Jerome contended in
his favour, regarding his first marriage as part of the old life
obliterated by baptism.

<span id="vi.xii.i.xxxiii-p3"></span> The allusion is, perhaps, to
Rufinus’ answer to Pope Anastasius translated in this volume.
