<span id="vi.xi.iii.viii-p1"></span> 7. You observe how new and terrible
a form of oath this is which he describes. The Lord Jesus Christ sits on
the tribunal as judge, the angels are assessors, and plead for him; and
there, in the intervals of scourgings and tortures, he swears that he
will never again have by him the works of heathen authors nor read them.
Now look back over the work we are dealing with, and tell me whether
there is a single page of it in which he does not again declare himself
a Ciceronian, or in which he does not speak of ‘our Tully,’ ‘our
Flaccus,’ ‘our Maro.’ <span id="fr_2942"></span>[2943](#fn_2942) As to
Chrysippus and Aristides, Empedocles and all the rest of the Greek
writers, he scatters their names around him like a vapour or halo, so as
to impress his readers with a sense of his learning and literary
attainments. Amongst the rest, he boasts of having read the books of
Pythagoras. Many learned men, indeed, declare these books to be
non-extant: but he, in order that he may illustrate every part of his
vow about heathen authors, declares that he has read even those which do
not exist in writing. In almost all his works he sets out many more and
longer quotations from these whom he calls ‘his own’ than from the
Prophets and Apostles who are ours. Even in the works which he addresses
to girls and weak women, who desire, as is right, only to be edified by
teaching out of our Scriptures, he weaves in illustrations from ‘his
own’ Flaccus and Tullius and Maro.
