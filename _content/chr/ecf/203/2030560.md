<span id="v.iv.xli-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.xli-p2.1"></span>Orosius, <span
id="fr_2639"></span>[2640](#fn_2639) </span> a Spanish presbyter, a man
most eloquent and learned in history, wrote eight books against those
enemies of the Christians who say that the decay of the Roman State was
caused by the Christian religion. In these rehearsing the calamities and
miseries and disturbances of wars, of pretty much the whole world from
the creation <span id="fr_2640"></span>[2641](#fn_2640) he shows that
the Roman Empire owed to the Christian religion its undeserved
continuance and the state of peace which it enjoyed for the worship of
God.

<span id="v.iv.xli-p5"></span>In the first book he described the world
situated within the ever flowing stream of Oceanus and intersected by
the Tanais, giving the situations of places, the names, number and
customs of nations, the characteristics of various regions, the wars
begun and the formation of empires sealed with the blood of kinsmen.

<span id="v.iv.xli-p6"></span>This is the Orosius who, sent by Augustine
to Hieronymus to teach the nature of the soul, returning, was the first
to bring to the West relics of the blessed Stephen the first martyr then
recently found. He flourished almost <span
id="fr_2641"></span>[2642](#fn_2641) at the end of the reign of the
emperor Honorius.
