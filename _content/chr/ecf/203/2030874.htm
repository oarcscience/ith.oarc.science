<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.xxvi-p1"></A>  25. The Gospel further relates that the soldiers parted the garments of Jesus among themselves, and cast lots upon His vesture. The Holy Spirit provided that this also should be witnessed beforehand by the Prophets, for David says, &#8220;They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they did cast lots.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3337"></A><A HREF="#fn_3337"><FONT SIZE="1">3338</FONT></A>
 Nor were the Prophets silent even as to the robe, the scarlet robe, which the soldiers are said to have put upon Him in mockery. Listen to Isaiah, &#8220;Who is this that cometh from Edom, red in his garments from Bozrah? Wherefore are thy garments red, and thy raiment as though thou hadst trodden in the wine-press?&#8221; To which Himself replies, &#8220;I have trodden the wine-press alone, O daughter of Sion.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3338"></A><A HREF="#fn_3338"><FONT SIZE="1">3339</FONT></A>
 For He alone it is Who hath not sinned, and hath taken away the sins of the world. For if by one man death could enter into the world, how much more by one man, Who was God also, could life be restored!</p>
