id="v.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.xiv-p2.1"></span>Prudentius</span>, <span
id="fr_2591"></span>[2592](#fn_2591) a man well versed in secular
literature, composed a *Trocheum* <span
id="fr_2592"></span>[2593](#fn_2592) of selected persons from the whole
Old and New Testament. He wrote a commentary also, after the fashion of
the Greeks, *On the six days of creation* from creation of the world
until the creation of the first man and his fall. He wrote also short
books which are entitled in the Greek, *Apotheosis, Psychomachia* and
*Hamartigenia,* that is *On divinity, On spiritual conflict, On the
origin of sin.* He wrote also *In praise of martyrs,* an invitation to
martyrdom in one book citing several as examples and another of *Hymns,*
but specially directed *Against Symmachus* <span
id="fr_2593"></span>[2594](#fn_2593) who defended idolatry, from which
we learn that Palatinus was a soldier.

<span id="v.iv.xiv-p4"></span> *Trocheum.* There is much controversy
over the word, some maintaining that it should be Dittochaeon= “the
double food or double testament” (Lock in Smith and Wace) or Diptychon.
It is a description of a series of pictures from the Bible. The <span
class="c14"><span id="v.iv.xiv-p4.1"></span>mss.</span> read Trocheum
a.e.; Troceum T 25; Trocetum 30; Trocleum A; Tropeum 31. A recent
monograph on the subject has not yet come to hand.

<span id="v.iv.xiv-p5"></span> *Symmachus.* Two works are here confused,
the work against Symmachus, and the Cathemerinon hymns, in the preface
to which the quotation occurs.
