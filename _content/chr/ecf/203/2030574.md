<span id="v.iv.lv-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.lv-p2.1"></span>Nestorius <span
id="fr_2662"></span>[2663](#fn_2662) </span>  <span
id="fr_2663"></span>[2664](#fn_2663) the heresiarch, was regarded, while
presbyter of the church at Antioch, as a remarkable extemporaneous
teacher, <span id="fr_2664"></span>[2665](#fn_2664) and <span
id="page_395">p. 395</span> <span id="v.iv.lv-Page_395"></span>composed
a great many treatises on various *Questions,* into which already at
that time <span id="fr_2665"></span>[2666](#fn_2665) he infused that
subtle evil, which afterwards became the poison of acknowledged impiety,
veiled meanwhile by moral exhortation. But afterwards, when commended by
his eloquence and abstemiousness he had been made pontiff of the church
at Constantinople, showing openly what he had for a long while
concealed, he became a declared enemy of the church, and wrote a book
*On the incarnation of the Lord,* formed of sixty-two passages from
Divine Scripture, used in a perverted meaning. What he maintained in
this book may be found in the catalogue of heretics.
