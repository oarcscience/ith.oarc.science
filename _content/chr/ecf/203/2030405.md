<span id="v.iii.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>Hegesippus <span
id="fr_2416"></span>[2417](#fn_2416) </span> who lived at a period not
far from the Apostolic age, writing a *History* of all ecclesiastical
events from the passion of our Lord, down to his own period, and
gathering many things useful to the reader, composed five volumes in
simple style, trying to represent the style of speaking of those whose
lives he treated. He says that he went to Rome in the time of Anicetus,
the tenth bishop after Peter, and continued there till the time of
Eleutherius, bishop of the same city, who had been formerly deacon under
Anicetus. Moreover, arguing against idols, he wrote a history, showing
from what error they had first arisen, and this work indicates in what
age he flourished. <span id="fr_2417"></span>[2418](#fn_2417) He says,
“They built monuments and temples to their dead as we see up to the
present day, <span id="fr_2418"></span>[2419](#fn_2418) such as the one
to Antinous, servant to the Emperor Hadrian, in whose honour also games
were celebrated, and a city founded bearing his name, and a temple with
priests established.” The Emperor Hadrian is said to have been enamoured
of Antinous.
