<span id="vi.xi.ii.xxiv-p1"></span> 23. But let us come to these two
Commentaries which he alone excepts from the general condemnation and
renunciation which he pronounces upon all the rest of his works; we
shall see with what modesty and self-restraint he conducts himself in
these: Remember that it is by these alone that he has chosen to prove
that he is sound in the faith, and that he is altogether opposed to
Origen. Let us examine then as witnesses these two books which alone of
all his writings are satisfactory to him, namely, the three books of his
commentary on the Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians, and the single book
(I think) on Ecclesiastes. Let us for a moment look into the one which
comes forward first, the Commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians.
Even here recognize in his arguments the influence of him who is as his
fellow, his partner and his brother mystic, to use his own
expression. <span id="fr_2861"></span>[2862](#fn_2861) And first of all,
as to these poor weak women about whom he makes himself merry, because
they say that after the resurrection they will not have their frail
bodies since they will be like the angels. Let us hear what he has to
say about them. In the third book of his Commentaries on the Epistle of
Paul to the Ephesians, on the passage in which it is said, <span
id="fr_2862"></span>[2863](#fn_2862) “He who loveth his own wife loveth
himself, for no man ever hated his own flesh;” after a few other
remarks, he says:

<span id="vi.xi.ii.xxiv-p4"></span>“Let us men then cherish our wives
and let our souls cherish our bodies in such a way as that the wives may
be turned into men and the bodies into spirits, and that there maybe no
difference of sex but that, as among the angels there is neither male
nor female, so we who are to be like the angels may begin here to be
what it is promised that we shall be in heaven.”
