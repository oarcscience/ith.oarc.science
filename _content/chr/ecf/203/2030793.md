<span id="vi.xii.ii.xxi-p1"></span> 20. What nonsense is this out of
which they fabricate a charge against me! It seems hardly worth while to
notice it. It is a story of my own about the council held by Damasus
Bishop of Rome, and I, under the name of a certain friend of his, am
attacked for it. He had given me some papers about church affairs to get
copied; and the story describes a trick practised by the Apollinarians
who borrowed one of these, a book of Athanasius’ to read in which occur
the words <span id="fr_3125"></span>[3126](#fn_3125) ‘Dominicus homo,’
and falsified it by first scratching out the words, and then writing
them in again on the erasure, so that it might appear, not that the book
had been falsified by them, but that the words had been added by me. I
beg you, my dearest friend, that in these matters of serious interest to
the church, where doctrinal truth is in question, and we are seeking for
the authority of our predecessors for the well-being of our souls to put
away silly stuff of this kind, and not take mere after-dinner stories as
if they were arguments. For it is quite possible that, even after you
have heard the true story from me, another who does not know it may
declare that it is made up, and composed in elegant language by you like
a mine of Philistion or a song of Lentulus or Marcellus.
