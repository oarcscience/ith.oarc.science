id="fr_2481"></span>[2482](#fn_2481) </span> of Africa, at first was
famous as a teacher of rhetoric, and afterwards on the persuasion of the
presbyter Caecilius, from whom he received his surname, he became a
Christian, and gave all his substance to the poor. Not long after he was
inducted into the presbytery, and was also made bishop of Carthage. It
is unnecessary to make a catalogue of the works of his genius, since
they are more conspicuous than the sun.

<span id="v.iii.lxix-p4"></span>He was put to death under the Emperors
Valerian and Gallienus, in the eighth persecution, on the same day that
Cornelius was put to death at Rome, but not in the same year.
