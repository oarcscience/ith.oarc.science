distinguished by his birth, by his excellent literary work, by his
devotion to poverty and by his humility, beloved also of the sainted men
Martin bishop of Tours and Paulinus Nolanus, wrote small books which are
far from despicable. He wrote to his sister many *Letters* exhorting to
love of God and contempt of the world. These are well known. He wrote
two to the above mentioned Paulinus Nolanus and others to others, but
because, in some, family matters are included, they have not been
collected for publication. He composed also a *Chronicle,* and wrote
also to the profit of many, a *Life of the holy Martin,* monk and
bishop, a man famous for signs and wonders and virtues. <span

Postumianus and Gallus,* in which he himself acted as mediator and judge
of the debate. The subject matter was the manner of life of the oriental
monks and of St. Martin—a sort of dialogue in two divisions. In the
first of these he mentions a decree of the bishops at the synod of
Alexandria in his own time to the effect that Origen is to be read,
though cautiously, by those who are wise, for the good that is in him,
and is to be rejected by the less able on account of the evil. In his
old age, he was led astray by the Pelagians, and recognizing the guilt
of much speaking, kept silent until his death, in order that by penitent
silence he might atone for the sin which he had contracted by speaking.
