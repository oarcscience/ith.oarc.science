 presbyter of the church at Alexandria in the reign of Carus and Diocletian, at the time when Theonas ruled as bishop in the same church, taught the people with great success and attained such elegance of language and published so many treatises on all sorts of subjects (which are still extant) that he was called Origen Junior. He was remarkable for his self-discipline, devoted to voluntary poverty, and thoroughly acquainted with the dialectic art. After the <A NAME="page_378"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 378</FONT></A> <a name="v.iii.lxxviii-Page_378"></A>persecution, he passed the rest of his life at Rome. There is extant a long treatise of his <i>On the prophet Hosea</i> which from internal evidence appears to have been delivered on the vigil of Passover.</p>
