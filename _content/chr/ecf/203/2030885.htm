<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.xxxvii-p1"></A>  36. &#8220;<span class="c14"><a name="vi.xiii.xxxvii-p1.1"></A>The Holy Church; The Forgiveness of Sin, the Resurrection of This Flesh</span>.&#8221; It is not said, &#8220;<i>In</i> the holy Church,&#8221; nor &#8220;<i>In</i> the forgiveness of sins,&#8221; nor &#8220;<i>In</i> the resurrection of the flesh.&#8221; For if the preposition &#8220;in&#8221; had been added, it would have had the same force as in the preceding articles. But now in those clauses in which the faith concerning the Godhead is declared, we say &#8220;<i>In</i> God the Father,&#8221; and &#8220;<i>In</i> Jesus Christ His Son,&#8221; and &#8220;<i>In</i> the Holy Ghost,&#8221; but in the rest, where we speak not of the Godhead but of creatures and mysteries, the preposition &#8220;<i>in</i> &#8221; is not added. We do not say &#8220;We believe <i>in</i> the holy Church,&#8221; but &#8220;We believe the holy Church,&#8221; not as God, but as the Church gathered together to God: and we believe that there is &#8220;forgiveness of sins;&#8221; we do not say &#8220;We believe <i>in</i> the forgiveness of sins;&#8221; and we believe that there will be a &#8220;Resurrection of the flesh;&#8221; we do not say &#8220;We believe <i>in</i> the resurrection of the flesh.&#8221; By this monosyllabic preposition, therefore, the Creator is distinguished from the creatures, and things divine are separated from things human.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.xxxvii-p2"></A>This then is the Holy Ghost, who in the Old Testament inspired the Law and the Prophets, in the New the Gospels and the Epistles. Whence also the Apostle says, &#8220;All Scripture given by inspiration of God is profitable for instruction.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3403"></A><A HREF="#fn_3403"><FONT SIZE="1">3404</FONT></A>
 And therefore it seems proper in this place to enumerate, as we have learnt from the tradition of the Fathers, the books of the New and of the Old Testament, which, according to the tradition of our forefathers, are believed to have been inspired by the Holy Ghost, and have been handed down to the Churches of Christ.</p>
