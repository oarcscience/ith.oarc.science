<p class="c31"><a name="iv.viii.iv.xxix-p2"></A><span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.iv.xxix-p2.1"></A>Terentius</span>, an excellent general, distinguished for his piety, had set up trophies of victory and returned from Armenia. On being ordered by Valens to choose a boon, he mentioned one which it was becoming in a man nurtured in piety to choose, for he asked not gold nor yet silver, not land, not dignity, not a house, but that one church might be granted to them that were risking their all for the Apostolic doctrine. Valens received the petition, but on becoming acquainted with its contents he tore it up in a rage, and bade Terentius beg some other boon. The count, however, picked up the pieces of his petition, and said, &#8220;I have my reward, sir, and I will not ask another. The Judge of all things is Judge of my intention.&#8221;</p>
