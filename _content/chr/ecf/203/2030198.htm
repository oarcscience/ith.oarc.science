<p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.ix-p2"></A>Your piety is annoyed and distressed at the sentence passed on me unjustly and without a trial. I am comforted that you are so feeling. Had I been justly condemned I should have been sorry at having given my judges reasonable grounds for what they have done, but, as it is, my conscience is quite clear, and I feel joyful and exultant and look forward to the remission of other sins on account of this injustice. Naboth lives in men&#146;s memories only because he suffered that unjust death. Only pray that we be not abandoned of God and let the enemy continue to do his worst. God&#146;s good will is enough to make me very cheerful and if He is on my side I despise all my troubles as trifles.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1624"></A><A HREF="#fn_1624"><FONT SIZE="1">1625</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.x.ix-p3"></A> Probably the condemnation referred to is the imperial Edict of March 449 relegating Theodoret to the limits of his own diocese. cf. Epp. 79. 80.</p>
