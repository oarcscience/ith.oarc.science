<span id="v.ii.v-p1"></span> 5. *Translations*.

<span id="v.ii.v-p2"></span>An early translation of Jerome’s work into
Greek was made by Sophronius and used by Photius. A translation
purporting to be his is given by Erasmus. There has been a good deal of
controversy over this, some even accusing Erasmus of having forged it
entire. It is an open question with a general tendency to give Erasmus
the benefit of the doubt. The present translator while holding his
judgment ready to be corrected by the finding of a <span
class="c14"><span id="v.ii.v-p2.1"></span>ms</span>. or other evidence,
inclines to reject *in toto,* regarding it as for the most part
trans<span id="page_356">p. 356</span> <span
id="v.ii.v-Page_356"></span>lated by Erasmus from some South German or
Swiss <span class="c14"><span id="v.ii.v-p2.2"></span>ms</span>., or, if
that be not certain, at least that the translation is too little
established to be of any use for textual purposes. There is a modern
translation of select words of Jerome in French by Matougues. The chief
sources for comparison used by the translator have been Sophronius (or
Erasmus) Matougues, M’Giffert’s Eusebius for the first part of Jerome
where he takes so liberally from Eusebius, and scattered selections here
and there in Ceillier, Smith and Wace, *Dict.* and other
literary-historical works.
