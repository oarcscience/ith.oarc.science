<span id="iv.x.cxxxv-p1"></span> *CXXXIV. To Theoctistus, Bishop of
Berœa.* <span id="fr_1964"></span>[1965](#fn_1964)

<span id="iv.x.cxxxv-p3"></span>Our Saviour, Lawgiver, and Lord, was
once asked, “What is the first commandment?” His reply was “Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy mind.” And He added “This is the first commandment: and the
second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.” Then
He said further “On these two commandments hang all the law and the
prophets.” <span id="fr_1965"></span>[1966](#fn_1965)

<span id="iv.x.cxxxv-p5"></span>He then who keeps these, according to
the definition of the Lord, plainly fulfils the Law; and he who
transgresses them is guilty of <span id="page_305">p. 305</span> <span
id="iv.x.cxxxv-Page_305"></span>transgressing the whole Law. Let us then
examine, before the exact and righteous tribunal of our conscience,
whether we have fulfilled the divine commandments. Now the first is kept
by him who guards the faith given by God in its integrity, who
abominates its assailants as enemies of the truth and hates heartily all
those who hate the beloved; and the second by him who most highly
esteems the care of his neighbour and who, not only in prosperity but
also in apparent misfortunes, observes the laws of friendship. They, on
the other hand, who look after their own safety, as they suppose, who on
its account make little of the laws of friendship and take no heed of
their friends when assaulted and attacked, are reckoned to belong to the
number of the wicked and of them that are without. The Lord of all
requires better things at the hands of His disciples. “Love” He says
“your enemies, for if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?
for the sinners and the publicans do this.” <span
id="fr_1966"></span>[1967](#fn_1966) I, however, have not received even
such kindness as publicans receive. Publicans, do I say? I have not even
received the consolation given to murderers and wizards in their
dungeons. If every one had imitated this cruelty, nothing else would
have been left then for me in my life time but to be wasted by want,
and, at my death, instead of being committed to a tomb, to be made
meat <span id="fr_1967"></span>[1968](#fn_1967) for dogs and wild
beasts. But I have found support in those who care nought for this
present life, but await the enjoyment of everlasting blessings, and
these furnish me with manifold consolation. But the loving Lord “caused
judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared and was still, when
God arose to judgment.” <span id="fr_1968"></span>[1969](#fn_1968) But
the wicked shall perish. <span id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969) The
falsehood of the new heresy has been proscribed, and the truth of the
divine Gospels is publicly proclaimed. I for my part exclaim with the
blessed David, “Blessed be the Lord God who only doeth wondrous things,
and blessed be His glorious name: and let the whole earth be filled with
His glory; amen and amen.” <span id="fr_1970"></span>[1971](#fn_1970)

<span id="iv.x.cxxxv-p2"></span> This letter marks the change in the
condition of affairs which followed on the death of Theodosius on July
29, 450, and the accession of Pulcheria and Marcian. Eutyches was
exiled, the eunuch Chrysaphius banished and executed, and Theodoret
recalled. It may be placed in the autumn of 450 or early in 451. The
earlier letter (xxxii) to Theoctistus claims on behalf of Celestinianus
a kindness which Theodoret in his then hour of need had failed to
receive.
