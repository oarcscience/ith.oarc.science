<span id="vi.xiii.xlvi-p1"></span> 45. Thus much in proof of the
profession which we make in the Creed when we say “The resurrection of
this flesh.” As to the addition “this” see how consonant it is with all
that we have cited from the divine books. What else does Job signify in
the place which we explained above, “He will raise again my skin, which
is now draining this cup of suffering,” that is, which is undergoing
these torments? Does he not plainly say that there will be a
resurrection of this flesh, this, I mean, which is now undergoing the
extremity of trials and tribulations? Moreover, when the Apostle says,
“This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
immortality,” <span id="fr_3425"></span>[3426](#fn_3425) are not his
words those of one who in a manner touches his body and places his
finger upon it? This body then, which is now corruptible, will by the
grace of the resurrection be incorruptible, and this which is now mortal
will be clothed with virtues of immortality, that, as “Christ rising
from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over
Him,” <span id="fr_3426"></span>[3427](#fn_3426) so those who shall rise
in Christ shall never again feel corruption or death, <span
id="page_562">p. 562</span> <span id="vi.xiii.xlvi-Page_562"></span>not
because the nature of flesh will have been cast off, but because its
condition and quality will have been changed. There will be a body,
therefore, which will rise from the dead incorruptible and immortal, not
only of the righteous, but also of sinners; of the righteous that they
may be able ever to abide with Christ, of sinners that they may undergo
without end the punishment due to them.
