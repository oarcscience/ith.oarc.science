<span id="iv.viii.i.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII</span>.—*The End of the
Holy Emperor Constantine*.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxxiii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.i.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>The</span> emperor was now translated
from his earthly dominions to a better kingdom <span
id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445) .

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxxiii-p4"></span>The body of the emperor was
enclosed in a golden coffin, and was carried to Constantinople by the
governors of the provinces, the military commanders, and the other
officers of state, preceded and followed by the whole army, all bitterly
deploring their loss; for Constantine had been as an affectionate father
to them all. The body of the emperor was allowed to remain in the palace
until the arrival of his sons, and high honours were rendered to it. But
these details require no description here, as a full account has been
given by other writers. From their works, which are easy of access, may
be learnt how greatly the Ruler of all honours His faithful servants. If
any one should be tempted to unbelief, let him look at what occurs now
near the tomb and the statue of Constantine <span
id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446) , and then he must admit the truth of
what God has said in the Scriptures, “*Them that honour Me I will
honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed* <span
id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447) .”

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxxiii-p5"></span> Valesius explains this allusion
by quoting the Arian Philostorgius (ii. 17), who says that “the statue
of Constantine, standing on its porphyry column, was honoured with
sacrifices, illuminations, and incense.” The accusation of idolatrous
worship may be disregarded. Cf. Chron. Alex. 665, 667.
