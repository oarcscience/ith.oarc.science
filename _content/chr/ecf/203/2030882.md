<span id="vi.xiii.xxxiv-p1"></span> 33. That He shall come to judge the
quick and the dead we are taught by many testimonies of the divine
Scriptures. But before we cite what the Prophets say on this point, we
think it necessary to remind you that this doctrine of the faith would
have us daily solicitous concerning the coming of the Judge, that we may
so frame our conduct as having to give account to the Judge who is at
hand. For this is what the Prophet said of the man who is blessed, that,
“He ordereth his words in judgment.” <span
id="fr_3387"></span>[3388](#fn_3387) When, however, He is said to judge
the quick and the dead, this does not mean that some will come to
judgment who are still living, others who are already dead; but that He
will judge both souls and bodies, where, by souls are meant “the quick,”
and the bodies “the dead;” as also the Lord Himself saith in the Gospel,
“Fear not them who are able to kill the body, but are not able to hurt
the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body
in Gehenna.” <span id="fr_3388"></span>[3389](#fn_3388)
