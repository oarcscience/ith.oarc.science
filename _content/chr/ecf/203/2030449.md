id="fr_2479"></span>[2480](#fn_2479) bishop of Rome, to whom eight
letters of Cyprian are extant, wrote a letter to Fabius, <span

*On the Roman, Italian, and African councils,* and another *On Novatian
and those who had fallen from the faith,* a third *On the acts of the
council,* and a fourth very prolix one to the same Fabius, containing
the causes of the Novatian heresy and an anathema of it. He ruled the
church for two years under Gallus and Volusianus. He received the crown
of martyrdom for Christ, and was succeeded by Lucius.
