<p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.xxxiv-p2"></A>All kinds of goodness are praiseworthy, but all are made more beautiful by loving kindness. For it we earnestly pray the God of all; through it alone we obtain forgiveness when we err; it makes wealth stoop to the poor, and because I know that your Excellency is richly endowed with it I confidently commend to you the admirable and excellent Celestinianus, once lord of vast wealth and possessions and suddenly stripped of all, but bearing his poverty as easily as few men bear their riches. The subject of the tragedy involving the fall of his fortunes is the barbarian invasion of Libya and Carthage. I have introduced him to your greatness; pray suggest his case to others, and move them to pity. You will win <A NAME="page_262"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 262</FONT></A> <a name="iv.x.xxxiv-Page_262"></A>greater gain by giving many a lesson in loving kindness:</p>
