<span id="iv.x.xxv-p1"></span> *XXV. Festal.*

<span id="iv.x.xxv-p2"></span>When the only begotten God had been made
Man, and had wrought out our salvation, they who in those days saw Him
from whom these bounties flowed kept no feast. But in our time, land and
sea, town and hamlet, though they cannot see their benefactor with eyes
of sense, keep a feast in memory of all He has done for them; and so
great is the joy flowing from these celebrations that the streams of
spiritual gladness run in all directions. Wherefore we now salute your
piety, at once to signify the cheerfulness which the feast has caused in
us, and to ask your prayers that we may keep it to the end.
