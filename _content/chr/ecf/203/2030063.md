<span id="iv.viii.ii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX</span>.—*The Second Return of
Saint Athanasius*.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.ix-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.ix-p2.1"></span>The</span> emperor Constantius, having
become acquainted with the plots formed against the bishops, wrote to
the great Athanasius once, and twice, aye and thrice, exhorting him to
<span id="page_74">p. 74</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.ix-Page_74"></span>return from the West <span
id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498) . I shall here insert the second
letter, because it is the shortest of the three.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.ix-p4"></span>Constantius Augustus the Conqueror to
Athanasius.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.ix-p5"></span>“Although I have already apprised you
by previous letters, that you can, without fear of molestation, return
to our court, in order that you may, according to my ardent desire, be
reinstated in your own bishopric, yet I now again despatch another
letter to your gravity to exhort you to take immediately, without fear
or suspicion, a public vehicle and return to us, in order that you may
receive all that you desire.”

<span id="iv.viii.ii.ix-p6"></span>When Athanasius returned, Constantius
received him with kindness, and bade him go back to the Church of
Alexandria <span id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499) . But there were some
attached to the court, infected with the errors of Arianism, who
maintained that Athanasius ought to cede one church to those who were
unwilling to hold communion with him. On this being mentioned to the
emperor, and by the emperor to Athanasius, he remarked, that the
imperial command appeared to be just; but that he also wished to make a
request. The emperor readily promising to grant him whatever he might
ask, he said that those in Antioch <span
id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500) who objected to hold communion with
the party now in possession of the churches wanted temples to pray in,
and that it was only fair that one House of God also be assigned to
them. This request was deemed just and reasonable by the emperor; but
the leaders of the Arian faction resisted its being carried into
execution, maintaining that neither party ought to have the churches
assigned to them. Constantius on this was struck with high admiration
for Athanasius, and sent him back to Alexandria <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501) . Gregorius was dead, having met his
end at the hands of the Alexandrians themselves <span
id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502) . The people kept high holiday in
honour of their pastor; feasting marked their joy at seeing him again,
and praise was given to God <span id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503) .
Not long after Constans departed this life <span
id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504) .

<span id="iv.viii.ii.ix-p3"></span> Athanasius had gone from Sardica to
Naissus (in upper Dacia), and thence to Aquileia, where he was received
by Constans. *Ap. ad Const.* §4, §3.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[74:500](2030063.htm#fr_499) <span
id="iv.viii.ii.ix-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.ix-p7"></span> Athanasius went from Aquileia to
Rome, where he saw Julius again, thence to Treves to the Court of
Constans, and back to the East to Antioch, where the conversation about
the “one church” took place. Soc. ii. 23; Soz. iii. 20.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[74:501](2030063.htm#fr_500) <span

id="iv.viii.ii.ix-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.ix-p9"></span> The more significant from the fact
that Constantius affected a more than human impassibility. Cf. the
graphic account of his entry into Rome “velut collo munito rectam aciem
luminum tendens, nec dextra vultum nec læva flectebat, tanquam figmentum
hominis: non cum rota concuteret nutans nec spuens aut os aut nasum
tergens vel fricans manumve agitans visus est unquam.” Amm. Marc. xvi.
10.

is described by Gregory of Nazianzus (Orat. 21). Authorities, however,
differ as to which return he paints.

the usurper Magnentius at Illiberis (re-named Helena by Constantine, and
now Elne, in Roussillon), <span class="c14"><span
