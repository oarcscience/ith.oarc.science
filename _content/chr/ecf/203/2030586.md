<span id="v.iv.lxvii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.lxvii-p2.1"></span>Syagrius <span
id="fr_2684"></span>[2685](#fn_2684) </span> wrote *On faith,* against
the presumptuous words, which heretics assume for the purpose of
destroying or superseding the names of the Holy Trinity, for they say
that the Father ought not to be called Father, lest the name, Son should
harmonize with that of Father, but that he should be called the
Unbegotten or the Imperishable and the Absolute, in order that whatever
may be distinct from Him in person, may also be separate in nature,
showing that the Father, who is unchangeable in nature may be called the
Unbegotten, though the Scripture may not call Him so, that the person of
the Son is begotten from Him, not made, and that the person of the Holy
Spirit proceeds from Him not begotten, and not made. Under the name of
this Syagrius I found seven books, entitled *On Faith and the rules of
Faith,* but as they did not agree in style, I did not believe they were
written by him.
