<span id="iv.viii.ii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX</span>.—*Concerning the
innovations of Eudoxius, <span id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571) of
Germanicia, and the zeal of Basilius <span
id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572) of Ancyra, and of Eustathius <span
id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573) of Sebasteia against him*.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xx-p7"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.xx-p7.1"></span>Germanicia</span> is a city on the coasts
of Cilicia, Syria, and Cappadocia, and belongs to the province called
Euphratisia. Eudoxius, the head of its church, directly he heard of the
death of Leontius, betook himself to Antioch and clutched the see, where
he ravaged the vineyard of the Lord like a wild boar. He did not even
attempt to hide his evil ways, like Leontius, but raged in direct attack
upon the apostolic decrees, and involved in various troubles all who had
the hardihood to gainsay him. Now at this time Basilius had succeeded
Marcellus, and held the helm of the church of Ancyra, the capital of
Galatia, and Sebastia, the chief city of Armenia, was under the guidance
of Eustathius. No sooner had these bishops heard of the iniquity and
madness of Eudoxius, than they wrote to inform the Emperor Constantius
of his audacity. Constantius was now still tarrying in the west, and,
after the death of the tyrants, was endeavouring to heal the harm they
had caused. Both bishops were well known to the Emperor and had great
influence with him on account of the high character they bore.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xx-p2"></span> Eudoxius, eighth bishop of
Constantinople, and formerly of Germanicia (Γερμανικεια, now Marash, or
Banicia), was one of the most violent of the Arians. He was originally
refused ordination by St. Eustathius, but on the deposition of that
bishop in 331 the Eusebians pushed him forward. After ruling at
Germanicia for some seventeen years he intruded himself on the see of
Antioch.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xx-p3"></span>Under the patronage of the Acacians
he became patriarch of Constantinople in 360, and died in 370.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[86:573](2030074.htm#fr_572) <span
id="iv.viii.ii.xx-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xx-p4"></span> Basilius, a learned physician, a
Semiarian of Ancyra, was made bishop of that see on the deposition of
Marcellus, in 336, and excommunicated at Sardica in 347. In 350 he was
reinstated at the command of Constantius. He was again exiled under
Acacian influence, failed to get restitution from Jovian, and probably
died in exile. (Soc. ii, 20, 26, iv, 24.) Vide also Theod. ii, 23. His
works are lost. Athanasius praises him as among those who were (de
Synod. 603 ed. Migne) “not far from accepting the Homousion.”

<span id="fn_573"></span>[86:574](2030074.htm#fr_573) <span
id="iv.viii.ii.xx-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xx-p5"></span> Eustathius was bishop of Sebasteia
or Sebaste (Siwas) on the Halys, from 357 to 380.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.xx-p6"></span>Basil, Ep. 244<span
id="iv.viii.ii.xx-p6.1"></span>, §9, says that he was a heretic “black
who could not turn white”; but he exhibited many shades of theological
colour, preserving through all vicissitudes a high personal character,
and a something “more than human.” Basil Ep. 212<span
id="iv.viii.ii.xx-p6.2"></span>, §2. Ordained by Eulalius, he was
degraded because he insisted on wearing very unclerical costume. (Soc.
ii, 43.) The question of the identity of this Eustathius with the
Eustathius condemned at the Council of Ancyra is discussed in the *Dict.
Christ. Ant*. i, 709.
