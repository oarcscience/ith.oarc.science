<p class="c46"><a name="iv.viii.iv.viii-p1"></A>  <span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.iv.viii-p1.1"></A>Chapter VIII</span>.&#8212;<i>Synodical Epistle of the Synod in Illyricum concerning the Faith</i>.</p>  
<p class="c31"><a name="iv.viii.iv.viii-p2"></A>&#8220;<span class="c14"><a name="iv.viii.iv.viii-p2.1"></A>The</span> bishops of Illyricum to the churches of God, and bishops of the dioceses of Asia, of Phrygia, and Carophrygia Pacatiana, greeting in the Lord.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.viii-p3"></A>&#8220;After meeting together and making long enquiry concerning the Word of salvation, we have set forth that the Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost is of one substance. And it seemed fitting to pen a letter to you, not that we write what concerns the worship of the Trinity in vain disputation, but in humility deemed worthy of the duty.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.viii-p4"></A>&#8220;This letter we have sent by our beloved brother and fellow labourer Elpidius the presbyter. For not in the letters of our hands, but in the books of our Saviour Jesus Christ, is it written &#145;I am of Paul and I of Apollos and I of Cephas and I of Christ. Was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_694"></A><A HREF="#fn_694"><FONT SIZE="1">695</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.viii-p6"></A>&#8220;It seemed indeed fitting to our humility not to pen any letter to you, on account of the great terror which your preaching causes to all the region under your jurisdiction, separating as you do the Holy Spirit from the Father and Son. We were therefore constrained to send to you our lord and fellow labourer Elpidius to ascertain if your preaching is really of this character and to carry this dispatch from the imperial government of Rome.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.viii-p7"></A>&#8220;Let them who do not regard the Trinity as one substance be anathema, and if any man be detected in communion with them let him be anathema.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.viii-p8"></A>&#8220;But for them that preach that the Trinity is of one substance the Kingdom of Heaven is prepared.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.viii-p9"></A>&#8220;We exhort you therefore brethren to teach no other doctrine, nor even hold any other and vain belief, but that always and everywhere, preaching the Trinity to be of one substance, ye may be able to inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.viii-p10"></A>&#8220;While writing on this point we have also been reminded to pen this letter to you about the present or future appointment of our fellow ministers as bishops, if there be any sound men among the bishops who have already discharged a public office;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_695"></A><A HREF="#fn_695"><FONT SIZE="1">696</FONT></A>
 and, if not, from the order of presbyters: in like manner of the appointment of presbyters and deacons out of the actual priestly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_696"></A><A HREF="#fn_696"><FONT SIZE="1">697</FONT></A>
 order that they may be in every way blameless, and not from the ranks of the senate and army.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.viii-p13"></A>&#8220;We have been unwilling to pen you a letter at length, because of the mission of one representative of all, our lord and fellow labourer Elpidius, to make diligent enquiry about your preaching, if it really is such as we have heard from our lord and fellow labourer Eustathius.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.viii-p14"></A>&#8220;In conclusion, if at any time you have been in error, put off the old man and put on the new. The same brother and fellow labourer Elpidius will instruct you how to preach the true faith that the Holy Trinity, of one substance with God the Father, together with the Son and Holy Ghost, is hallowed, glorified, and made manifest, Father in Son, Son in Father, with the Holy Ghost for ever and ever. For since this has been made manifest, we shall manifestly be able to confess the Holy Trinity to be of one substance according to the faith set forth formerly at Nic&aelig;a which the Fathers confirmed. So long as this faith is preached we shall be able to avoid the snares of the deadly devil. When he is destroyed we shall be able to do homage to one another in letters of peace while we live in peace.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.viii-p15"></A>&#8220;We have therefore written to you in order that ye may know the deposition of the Ariomaniacs, who do not confess that the Son is of the substance of the Father nor the Holy Ghost. We subjoin their names,&#8212;Polychronius, Telemachus, Faustus, Asclepiades, Amantius, Cleopater.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.viii-p16"></A>&#8220;This we thus write to the glory of Father and Son and Holy Ghost for ever and ever, amen. We pray the Father and the Son our Saviour Jesus Christ with the Holy Ghost that you may fare well for many years.&#8221;</p>
