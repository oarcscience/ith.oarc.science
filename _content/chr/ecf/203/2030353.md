<span id="iv.x.clxiv-p1"></span> *CLXIII. First Letter of the
Commissioners of the East, sent to Chalcedon, among whom was
Theodoretus.* <span id="fr_2269"></span>[2270](#fn_2269)

<span id="iv.x.clxiv-p4"></span>On our arrival at Chalcedon, for neither
we ourselves nor our opponents were permitted to enter Constantinople,
on account of the seditions of the excellent monks, we heard that eight
days before we had appeared (behold the glory of the most pious prince)
the lord Nestorius was dismissed from Ephesus, free to go where he
would; whereat we are much distressed, since verily deeds done illegally
and informally now seem to have some force. Let your holiness however be
assured that we shall eagerly join the battle for the Faith, and are
willing to fight even unto death. To-day, the 11th of the month
Gorpiæum, <span id="fr_2270"></span>[2271](#fn_2270) we are expecting
our very pious Emperor to cross over to the Rufinianum, <span
id="fr_2271"></span>[2272](#fn_2271) and there to hear the trial.

<span id="iv.x.clxiv-p7"></span>We therefore beg your holiness to pray
the Lord Christ to help us to be able to confirm the faith of the holy
Fathers, and to pluck up by the roots these Chapters which have sprouted
to the damage of the Church. We implore your holiness to think and act
with us, and to abide in your ready devotion to the orthodox faith. When
this letter was written the lord Himerius <span
id="fr_2272"></span>[2273](#fn_2272) had not yet met us, being
peradventure hindered on the road. But do not let this trouble you. Only
let your piety strenuously support us, and we trust that gloom will
disappear, and the truth shine forth.
