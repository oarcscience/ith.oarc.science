<span id="vi.xiii.xi-p1"></span> 10. Starting from this point you may
understand the majesty of the Holy Ghost also. For the Gospel witnesses
of Him that when the angel said to the Virgin, “Thou shalt bring forth a
Son and shalt call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from
their sins,” <span id="fr_3279"></span>[3280](#fn_3279) she replied,
“How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?” on which the angel said to
her, “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest
shall overshadow thee. Wherefore that holy Thing which shall be born of
Thee shall be called the Son of God.” <span
id="fr_3280"></span>[3281](#fn_3280) See here the Trinity mutually
cooperating with each other. The Holy Ghost is spoken of as coming upon
the Virgin, and the Power of the Highest as overshadowing her. What is
the Power of the Highest but Christ Himself, Who is the Power of God and
the Wisdom of God? Whose is this Power? The Power of the Highest. There
is here then the Highest, there is also the Power of the Highest, there
is also the Holy Ghost. This is the Trinity, everywhere latent, and
everywhere apparent, distinct in names and persons, but inseparable in
the substance of the Godhead. And although the Son alone is born of the
Virgin, yet there is present also the Highest, there is present also the
Holy Ghost, that both the conception and the bringing forth of the
Virgin may be sanctified.
