<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.xix-p1"></A>  18. They who have handed down the Creed to us have with much forethought specified the time when these things were done&#8212;&#8220;under Pontius Pilate,&#8221;&#8212;lest in any respect the tradition should falter, as though vague and uncertain. But it should be known that the clause, &#8220;He descended into Hell,&#8221; is not added in the Creed of the Roman Church, neither is it in that of the Oriental Churches. It seems to be implied, however, when it is said that &#8220;He was buried.&#8221; But in the love and zeal for the Divine Scriptures which possess you, you say to me, I doubt not, &#8220;These things ought to be proved by more evident testimonies from the Divine Scriptures. For the more important the things are which are to be believed, so much the more do they need apt and undoubted witness.&#8221; True. But we, as speaking to those who know the law, have left unnoticed, for the sake of brevity, a whole forest of testimonies. But if this also be required, let us cite a few out of many, knowing, as we do, that to those who are acquainted with the Scriptures, a very ample sea of testimonies lies open.</p>
