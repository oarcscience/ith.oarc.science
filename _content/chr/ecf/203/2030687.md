<span id="vi.xi.iii.iii"></span>

<span id="vi.xi.iii.iii-p1"></span> 2. Let us see what my adversary
himself says on this point in those Commentaries which he has selected.
In the second book, in commenting on the words <span
id="fr_2925"></span>[2926](#fn_2925) “Wherefore, putting away lying,
speak every man truth to his neighbour, for we are members one of
another” (after a short introduction) he speaks as follows:

<span id="vi.xi.iii.iii-p3"></span>“Hence Paul himself, who was one of
the perfect, says in another Epistle “We speak wisdom among them that
are perfect.” <span id="fr_2926"></span>[2927](#fn_2926) This then is
what is commanded, that those mystic and secret things, which are full
of divine truth, should be spoken by each man to his neighbour, so that
day unto day may utter speech and night to night shew knowledge, <span
id="fr_2927"></span>[2928](#fn_2927) that is, that a man should show all
those clear and lucid truths which he knows to those to whom the words
can be worthily addressed: “Ye are the light of the world.” <span
id="fr_2928"></span>[2929](#fn_2928) On the other hand, he should
exhibit everything involved in darkness and wrapped up in the mist of
symbols to others who are themselves nothing but mist and darkness,
those of whom it is said “And there was darkness under his feet,” <span
id="fr_2929"></span>[2930](#fn_2929) that is, of course, under the feet
of God. For on Mount Sinai Moses enters into the whirlwind and the mist
where God was; and it is written of God, “He has made darkness his
secret place.” <span id="fr_2930"></span>[2931](#fn_2930) Let each man
then thus speak truth in a mystery to his neighbour, and not give that
which is holy to dogs nor cast his pearls before swine; <span
id="fr_2931"></span>[2932](#fn_2931) but those who are anointed with the
oil of truth, them let him lead into the bridechamber of the spouse,
into the inner sanctuary of the King.”

<span id="vi.xi.iii.iii-p10"></span>Observe, I beg you, look carefully
and see whether in all this passage there is any one else but himself on
whom the condemnation can fall. If his adversaries were looking for an
opportunity of convicting and destroying him on the ground of what he
has written, what other course could they take, and what other
testimonies could they wish to produce against him than these which he
produces against himself as if he were pleading against another? If it
were sought to pronounce a condemnation against him, his own letter
would suffice. You have only to change the name; the test of the
accusation suits no one but himself alone. What he calls on us on the
one hand to condemn, he exhorts us on the other hand to follow: what he
asserts, that he reproves: what he hates, that he does. How happy must
be his disciples who obey and imitate him!
