id="iv.viii.v.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*Of the return of the
bishops*.

<span id="iv.viii.v.ii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.v.ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> emperor at once gave plain
indications of his adherence to true religion, and offered the first
fruits of his kingdom to the Lord of all, by publishing an edict
commanding the exiled shepherds to return, and to be restored to their
flocks, and ordering the sacred buildings to be delivered to
congregations adopting communion with Damasus. <span
id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809)

<span id="iv.viii.v.ii-p4"></span>This Damasus, the successor of
Liberius in the see of Rome, was a man of most praiseworthy life and by
his own choice alike in word and deed a champion of Apostolic doctrines.
To put his edict in force Gratianus sent Sapor the general, a very
famous character at that time, with orders to expel the preachers of the
blasphemies of Arius like wild beasts from the sacred folds, and to
effect the restoration of the excellent shepherds to God’s flocks.

<span id="iv.viii.v.ii-p5"></span>In every instance this was effected
without dispute except in Antioch, the Eastern capital, where a quarrel
was kindled which I shall proceed to describe.
