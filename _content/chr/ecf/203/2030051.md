afterwards <span id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441) the emperor was taken
ill at Nicomedia, a city of Bithynia, and, knowing the uncertainty of
human life, he received the holy rite of baptism <span
id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442) , which he had intended to have
deferred until he could be baptized in the river Jordan.

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxxi-p5"></span>He left as heirs of the imperial
throne his three sons, Constantine, Constantius, and Constans <span

<span id="iv.viii.i.xxxi-p7"></span>He ordered that the great Athanasius
should <span id="page_64">p. 64</span> <span
id="iv.viii.i.xxxi-Page_64"></span>return to Alexandria, and expressed
this decision in the presence of Eusebius, who did all he could to
dissuade him.
