<p class="c31"><a name="iv.viii.v.vi-p2"></A><span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.v.vi-p2.1"></A>The</span> great general remained, and then saw a wonderful vision clearly shewn him by the very God of the universe himself. In it he seemed to see the divine Meletius, chief of the church of the Antiochenes, investing him with an imperial robe, and covering his head with an imperial crown. The morning after the night in which he had seen the vision he told it to one of his intimate friends, who pointed out that the dream was plain and had nothing obscure or ambiguous about it.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.v.vi-p3"></A>A few days at most had gone by when the commissioners sent to investigate the battle returned and reported that vast multitudes of the barbarians had been shot down.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.v.vi-p4"></A>Then the emperor was convinced that he had done right well in selecting Theodosius for the command, and appointed him emperor and gave him the sovereignty of the share of Valens.</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.v.vi-p5"></A>Upon this Gratian departed for Italy and despatched Theodosius to the countries committed to his charge. No sooner had Theodosius assumed the imperial dignity than before everything else he gave heed to the harmony of the churches, and ordered the bishops of his own realm to repair with haste to Constantinople. That division of the empire was now the only region infected with the Arian plague, for the west had escaped the taint. This was due to the fact that Constantine the eldest of Constantine&#146;s sons, and Constans the youngest, had preserved their father&#146;s faith in its integrity, and that Valentinian, emperor of the West, had also kept the true religion undefiled.</p>
