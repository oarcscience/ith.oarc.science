<span id="iv.x.lxxxvii-p1"></span> *LXXXVII. To Domnus, Bishop of
Apamea.* <span id="fr_1792"></span>[1793](#fn_1792)

<span id="iv.x.lxxxvii-p3"></span>The law of brotherly love demanded
that I should receive many letters from your godliness at this time. For
the divine Apostle charges us to weep with them that weep and rejoice
with them that do rejoice. <span id="fr_1793"></span>[1794](#fn_1793) I
have not received a single one, although just lately I was visited by
some of the pious monks of your monastery with the pious presbyter
Elias. Nevertheless I have written, and I salute your holiness; and I
make you acquainted with the fact that the consolation of the Master has
stood me in stead of all other, for in truth not even had I as many
mouths as I have hairs on my head, could I worthily praise Him for my
being deemed worthy of suffering on account of my confession of Him, and
for the apparent disgrace which I hold more august than any honour. And
if I be banished to the uttermost parts of the earth all the more will I
praise Him as being counted worthy of greater blessings. Nevertheless I
hope your holiness will put up prayers for the quiet of the holy
churches. It is because of the storm that is assailing them that I wail
and groan and lament. That quiet, as I know, was driven away by the
Osrhoene clergy, <span id="fr_1794"></span>[1795](#fn_1794) who poured
out countless words against me, although I had no share in their
condemnation, nor in the sentence passed upon them; on the contrary, as
your holiness knows, I besought <span id="page_283">p. 283</span> <span
id="iv.x.lxxxvii-Page_283"></span>that the communion might be given to
them at Easter. But slanderers find no difficulty in saying what they
like. My consolation lies in the blessing of the Master who said,
“Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall
say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake; rejoice and be
exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted
they the prophets which were before you.” <span

<span id="iv.x.lxxxvii-p5"></span> The action of the Osrhoene clergy
here referred to is their accusation of Theodoret’s friend Ibas of
Edessa. The “sentence” was that of excommunication delivered by Ibas.
The leaders of the cabal against him were instigated by Uranius, bishop
of Himeria, one of Ibas’s suffragans. cf. note on p. 291.
