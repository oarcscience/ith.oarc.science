<span id="iv.x.xii-p1"></span> *XII. To the Bishop Irenæus.* <span
id="fr_1625"></span>[1626](#fn_1625)

<span id="iv.x.xii-p3"></span>Job, that famous tower of adamant and
noble champion of goodness, was not shaken even by blows of continuous
troubles of every sort and kind, but stood impregnable and firm. At the
end however of all his trials the righteous Law-giver explained the
reason of them in the words, “Dost thou think that I answered thee for
any other reason than that thou mightest appear just?” <span
id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626) I think that these words are known
to your piety which is able to support the many and various attacks of
troubles and anxieties, and so far from shrinking from them, exhibits
the strength and stability of your administration. So the bountiful
Lord, seeing the bravery and holiness of your soul, has refused to keep
a worthy champion in concealment, and has brought him forth to the
contest to adorn your venerable head with a crown of victory, and give
your struggles as a high example of good service to the rest. So, my
dear friend, conquer in this battle too, and bear bravely the death of
your son-in-law, my own dear friend. Conquer in your wisdom the claims
of kinsmanship and the memory of a noble and generous character, a
memory which must always recall something beyond painter’s art or
rhetorician’s skill. Repel the assault of sorrow by the thought of Him
who wisely administers all the affairs of men, with perfect knowledge of
the future and right guidance of it for our good. Let us join in the joy
of him who has been delivered from this life’s storms. Let us rather
give thanks because, wafted by kindly winds, he has cast anchor in the
windless haven and has escaped the grievous shipwrecks whereof this life
is full. But need I say all this to one who is a tried gladiator of
goodness? Need I, as it were, anoint for endurance one who is a trainer
of other athletes? Still I write. It is a comfort to myself to write as
I do. I am really and truly grieved when I remember an intimacy that I
esteemed so highly. Once more I praise the great Guide of all, Who both
knows what would be good for us and guides our life accordingly. I have
dictated this after writing my former communication, on one of my
friends in Antioch telling me that the end had come.
