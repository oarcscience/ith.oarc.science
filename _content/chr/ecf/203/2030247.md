<span id="iv.x.lviii-p1"></span> *LVIII. To the Consul Nomus.* <span
id="fr_1702"></span>[1703](#fn_1702)

<span id="iv.x.lviii-p3"></span>I am divided in mind at the idea of
sending a letter to your greatness. On the one hand I know how
everything depends on your judgment; I see you under the weight of
public anxieties, and so think it better to be silent. On the other
hand, being well aware of the breadth and capacity of your intelligence,
I cannot bear to say nothing, and am afraid of being charged with
negligence. I am moreover stimulated by the longing regret left with me
by the short taste I had of your society. My full enjoyment of it was
prevented by the disease and death of that most blessed man, so now I
think writing will be a comfort. I pray the Master of all to guide your
life that it be ever borne on favourable breezes and so we may reap the
benefit of your kindly care.
