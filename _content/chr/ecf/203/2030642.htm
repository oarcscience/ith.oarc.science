<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xi.ii.v-p1"></A>  4. At the very beginning of his work he says, &#8220;As if they could not be heretics by themselves, without me.&#8221; I must first show that, whether with him or without him, we are no heretics: then, when our status is made clear, we shall be safe from having the infamous imputation hurled at us from other men&#146;s reports. I was already living in a monastery, where, as both he and all others know, about 30 years ago, I was made regenerate by Baptism, and received the seal of the faith at the hands of those saintly men, Chromatius,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2822"></A><A HREF="#fn_2822"><FONT SIZE="1">2823</FONT></A>
 Jovinus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2823"></A><A HREF="#fn_2823"><FONT SIZE="1">2824</FONT></A>
 and Eusebius,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2824"></A><A HREF="#fn_2824"><FONT SIZE="1">2825</FONT></A>
 all of them now bishops, well-tried and highly esteemed in the church of God, one of whom was then a presbyter of the church under Valerian of blessed memory, the second was archdeacon, the third Deacon, and to me a spiritual father, my teacher in the creed and the articles of belief. These men so taught me, and so I believe, namely, that the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are of one Godhead, of one Substance: a Trinity coeternal, inseparable, incorporeal, invisible, incomprehensible, known to itself alone as it truly is in its perfection: For &#8220;No man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2825"></A><A HREF="#fn_2825"><FONT SIZE="1">2826</FONT></A>
 knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father but the Son&#8221;: and the Holy Spirit is he who &#8220;searcheth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2826"></A><A HREF="#fn_2826"><FONT SIZE="1">2827</FONT></A>
 the deep things of God&#8221;: that this Trinity, therefore, is without all bodily visibility, but that it is with the eye of the understanding that the Son and the Holy Spirit see the Father even as the Father sees the Son and the Holy Spirit; and further, that in this Trinity there is no diversity except that one is Father, another Son and a third Holy Spirit. There is a Trinity as touching the distinction of persons, a unity in the reality of the Substance. We received, further, that the only begotten Son of God, through whom in the beginning all existing things were made, whether visible or invisible, in these last days took upon him a human body and Soul, and was made man, and suffered for our salvation; and the third day he rose again from <A NAME="page_437"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 437</FONT></A> <a name="vi.xi.ii.v-Page_437"></A>the dead in that very flesh which had been laid in the sepulchre; and in that very same flesh made glorious he ascended into the heavens, whence we look for his coming to judge the quick and the dead. But further we confess that he gave us hope that we too should rise in a similar manner, so that we believe that our resurrection will be in the same manner and process, and in the same form, as the resurrection of our Lord himself from the dead: that the bodies which we shall receive will not be phantoms or thin vapours, as some slanderously affirm that we say, but these very bodies of ours in which we live and in which we die. For how can we truly believe in the resurrection of the flesh, unless the very nature of flesh remains in it truly and substantially? It is then without any equivocation, that we confess the resurrection of this real and substantial flesh of ours in which we live.</p>
