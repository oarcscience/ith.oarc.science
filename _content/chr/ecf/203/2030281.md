<span id="iv.x.xcii-p1"></span> *XCII. To Anatolius the
Patrician.* <span id="fr_1803"></span>[1804](#fn_1803)

<span id="iv.x.xcii-p3"></span>The very holy lord archbishop Domnus has
arranged for the most pious bishops to repair to the imperial city, with
a view to the complete refutation of the false accusation made against
us all. At this time we stand in especial need of the aid of your
magnificence, since the Lord of all has endowed you with the gifts of
pure faith, of warm zeal in its behalf, of intelligence and capacity,
and power withal to carry out your prudent counsels. I beg you therefore
to defend the cause of the wronged, to contend against lies, and
champion the apostolic teaching now assailed. Without doubt the master
and guide of the churches will bless your endeavour, will scatter the
lowering cloud, and bless the nurslings of the faith with clear sky.
Even should He permit the tempest to prevail, your greatness will reap
your perfect reward, and we shall bow our heads before the storm, ready
to live with cheerfulness wheresoever it may drive us, and waiting the
judgment of God and his true and righteous sentence.
