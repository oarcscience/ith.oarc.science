<p class="c60"><a name="vi.xi.iii.xxii-p1"></A>  18. Lastly, take the following from another letter to Marcella:</p>  
<p class="c70"><a name="vi.xi.iii.xxii-p2"></A>&#8220;The blessed Martyr Pamphilus, whose life Eusebius the Bishop of C&aelig;sarea set forth in some three volumes, wished to rival Demetrius Phalereus and Pisistratus, in his zeal to establish a library of sacred books: he sought out all through the world representative works of great minds, which are their true and everlasting monuments; but most of all he acquired at great expense all the books written by Origen, and gave them to the church at C&aelig;sarea. This library was afterwards partly destroyed; but Acatius and later on Euzoius, Bishops of that church, endeavoured to reestablish it in parchment volumes. The last of these recovered a great many works, and left us an inventory of them, but he shews that he could not find the Commentary on the hundred and twenty-sixth Psalm and the Tract on the Hebrew letter Pe, by the fact that he does not mention it. Not that so great a man as Adamantius passed over anything, but that, through the negligence of his successors it did not remain to times within our memory.&#8221;</p>
