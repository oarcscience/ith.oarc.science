 known also as Lactantius, a disciple of Arnobius, during the reign of Diocletian summoned to Nicomedia with Flavius the Grammarian whose poem <i>On medicine</i> is still extant, taught rhetoric there and on account of his lack of pupils (since it was a Greek city) he betook himself to writing. We have a <i>Banquet</i> of his which he wrote as a young man in Africa and an <i>Itinerary</i> of a journey from Africa to Nicomedia written in hexameters, and another book which is called <i>The Grammarian</i> and a most beautiful one <i>On the wrath of God,</i> and <i>Divine institutes against the nations,</i> seven books, and an <i>Epitome</i> of the same work in one volume, without a title,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2500"></A><A HREF="#fn_2500"><FONT SIZE="1">2501</FONT></A>
 also two books <i>To Asclepiades,</i> one book <i>On persecution,</i> four books of Epistles to Probus, two books of <i>Epistles to Severus,</i> two books of <i>Epistles to his pupil Demetrius</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2501"></A><A HREF="#fn_2501"><FONT SIZE="1">2502</FONT></A>
 and one book to the same <i>On the work of God or the creation of man.</i> In his extreme old age he was tutor to Crispus C&aelig;sar a son of Constantine in Gaul, the same one who was afterwards put to death by his father.</p>
