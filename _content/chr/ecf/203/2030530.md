id="fr_2586"></span>[2587](#fn_2586) the Egyptian monk, distinguished
for his miracles and virtues, wrote one letter which was addressed to
the younger men of his profession. In this he taught them that he could
serve God perfectly who, knowing the condition of his creation, should
devote himself to all labours, and by wrestling against every thing
which is agreeable in this life, and at the same time imploring the aid
of God would attain also to natural purity and obtain continence, as a
well merited gift of nature.
