<span id="v.iii.i-p4"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.i-p4.1"></span>Preface.</span>

<span id="v.iii.i-p5"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.i-p5.1"></span>You</span> have urged me, Dexter, <span
id="fr_2319"></span>[2320](#fn_2319) to follow the example of
Tranquillus <span id="fr_2320"></span>[2321](#fn_2320) in giving a
systematic account of ecclesiastical writers, and to do for our writers
what he did for the illustrious men of letters among the Gentiles,
namely, to briefly set before you all those who have published <span
id="fr_2321"></span>[2322](#fn_2321) any memorable writing on the Holy
Scriptures, from the time of our Lord’s passion until the fourteenth
year of the Emperor Theodosius. <span
id="fr_2322"></span>[2323](#fn_2322) A similar work has been done by
Hermippus <span id="fr_2323"></span>[2324](#fn_2323) the peripatetic,
Antigonus Carystius, <span id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324) the
learned Satyrus, <span id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325) and most
learned of all, Aristoxenus the Musician, <span
id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326) among the Greeks, and among the
Latins by Varro, <span id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327)
Santra, <span id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328) Nepos, <span
id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329) Hyginus, <span
id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330) and by him through whose example
you seek to stimulate <span id="fr_2331"></span>[2332](#fn_2331)
us,—Tranquillus.

<span id="v.iii.i-p19"></span>But their situation and mine is not the
same, for they, opening the old histories and chronicles could as if
gathering from some great meadow, weave some <span
id="fr_2332"></span>[2333](#fn_2332) small crown at least for their
work. As for me, what shall I do, who, having no predecessor, have, as
the saying is, the worst possible master, namely myself, and yet I must
acknowledge that Eusebius Pamphilus in the ten books of his Church
History has been of the utmost assistance, and the works of various
among those of whom we are to write, often testify to the dates of their
authors. And so I pray the Lord Jesus, <span
id="fr_2333"></span>[2334](#fn_2333) that what your Cicero, who stood at
the summit of Roman eloquence, did not scorn to do, compiling in his
*Brutus,* a catalogue of Latin orators, this I too may accomplish in the
enumeration of ecclesiastical writers, and accomplish in a fashion
worthy of the exhortation which you made. But if, perchance any of those
who are yet writing have been overlooked by me in this volume, they
ought to ascribe it to themselves, rather than to me, for among those
whom I have not read, I could not, in the first place, know those who
concealed their own writings, and, in the second place, what is perhaps
well known to others, would be quite unknown to me in this out of the
way corner of the earth. <span id="fr_2334"></span>[2335](#fn_2334) But
surely when they are distinguished by their writings, they will not very
greatly grieve over any loss in our non-mention of them. Let Celsus,
Porphyry, and Julian learn, rabid as they are against Christ, let their
followers, they who think the church has had no philosophers or orators
or men of learning, learn how many and what sort of men founded, built
and adorned it, and cease to accuse our faith of such rustic simplicity,
and recognize rather their own ignorance.

<span id="v.iii.i-p23"></span>In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
farewell. <span id="fr_2335"></span>[2336](#fn_2335)
