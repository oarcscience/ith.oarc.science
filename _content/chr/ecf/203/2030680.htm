<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xi.ii.xliii-p1"></A>  41. You see how he represents these opinions as things which are held as a kind of esoteric mystery by certain persons, of whom, however, he is one, as we have shewn over and over again: only, he uses this figure of speech so that he may escape the imputations attached to this mystic gnosis. You see, he will tell us, how the matter stands. You would never think of attributing to me the opinion that all things are eventually to be restored to one condition, and to be made up again into one body. I beg you not to impute this to me. If I say that an opinion is another man&#146;s, let it be another&#146;s; if you afterwards find any opinion written down without any &#145;other&#146; person being thrown in, you will be right in ascribing it to me. What then? are we to lose the fruit of all the trouble we have taken further back on this point? Such is the power of effrontery. However, let it be as he chooses; I put aside the truth of the matter and accept his own terms; but he will still be convicted. I will refer on the matter now in hand to the second book of these Commentaries, at the passage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2909"></A><A HREF="#fn_2909"><FONT SIZE="1">2910</FONT></A>
 &#8220;Giving diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one spirit, even as ye were called in one hope of your calling.&#8221; After several remarks, he proceeds:</p>  
<p class="c70"><a name="vi.xi.ii.xliii-p3"></A>&#8220;The question arises how there can be one hope of our calling, when in the Father&#146;s house there are many mansions: to which we reply that the kingdom of heaven is the one hope of our calling, as being the one house of our Father&#146;s but that in one house there are many mansions or rooms. For there is one glory of the sun, another of the moon, another of the stars. But certainly it is possible that there is a deeper meaning, namely, that in the consummation of the world, all things are to be restored to their primitive condition, and that then we shall all be made one body, and formed anew into the perfect man, and that thus the Saviour&#146;s Prayer will be fulfilled in us,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2910"></A><A HREF="#fn_2910"><FONT SIZE="1">2911</FONT></A>
 &#145;Father, grant that, as thou and I are one, so they also may be one in us.&#146;&#8221;</p>
