<span id="v.iii.xliii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.xliii-p2.1"></span>Serapion</span>, <span
id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448) ordained bishop of Antioch in the
eleventh year of the emperor Commodus, wrote a letter to Caricus and
Pontius <span id="fr_2449"></span>[2450](#fn_2449) on the heresy of
Montanus, in which he said “that you may know moreover that the madness
of this false doctrine, that is the <span id="page_372">p. 372</span>
<span id="v.iii.xliii-Page_372"></span>doctrine of a new prophecy, is
reprobated by all the world, I have sent to you the letters of the most
holy Apollinaris bishop of Hierapolis in Asia.” He wrote a volume also
to Domnus, who in time of persecution went over to the Jews, and another
work on the gospel which passes under the name of Peter, a work to the
church of the Rhosenses in Cilicia who by the reading of this book had
turned aside to heresy. There are here and there short letters of his,
harmonious in character with the ascetic life of their author.
