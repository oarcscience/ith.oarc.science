 presbyter of the Alexandrian church, and a pupil of the Pantaenus mentioned above, led the theological school at Alexandria after the death of his master and was teacher of the Catechetes. He is the author of notable volumes, full of eloquence and learning, both in sacred Scripture and in secular literature; among these are the <i>Stromata,</i> eight books, <i>Hypotyposes</i> eight books, <i>Against the nations</i> one book, <i>On pedagogy</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2444"></A><A HREF="#fn_2444"><FONT SIZE="1">2445</FONT></A>
 three books, <i>On the Passover, Disquisition on fasting</i> and another book entitled, <i>What rich man is saved</i>? one book <i>On Calumny, On ecclesiastical canons and against those who follow the error of the Jews,</i> one book which he addressed to Alexander bishop of Jerusalem. He also mentions in his volumes of <i>Stromata</i> the work of Tatian <i>Against the nations</i> which we mentioned above and a <i>Chronography</i> of one Cassianus, a work which I have not been able to find. He also mentioned certain Jewish writers against the nations, one Aristobulus and Demetrius and Eupolemus who after the example of Josephus asserted the primacy of Moses and the Jewish people.

He flourished moreover during the reigns of Severus and his son Antoninus.</p>
