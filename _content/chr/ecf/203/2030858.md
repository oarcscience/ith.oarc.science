<span id="vi.xiii.x-p1"></span> <span id="page_547">p. 547</span> <span
id="vi.xiii.x-Page_547"></span>9. “<span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xiii.x-p1.1"></span>Who Was Born by</span> *(de)* <span
class="c14"><span id="vi.xiii.x-p1.2"></span>The Holy Ghost of the
Virgin Mary</span>.” This nativity among men is in the way of
dispensation, <span id="fr_3276"></span>[3277](#fn_3276) whereas the
former nativity is of the divine substance; the one results from his
condescension, the other from his essential nature. He is born by the
Holy Ghost of the Virgin. Here a chaste ear and a pure mind is required.
For you must understand that now a temple hath been built within the
secret recesses of a Virgin’s womb for Him of Whom erewhile you learnt
that He was born ineffably of the Father. And just as in the
sanctification of the Holy Ghost no thought of imperfection is to be
admitted, so in the Virgin-birth no defilement is to be imagined. For
this birth was a new birth given to this world, and rightly new. For He
Who is the only Son in heaven is by consequence the only Son on earth,
and was uniquely born, born as no other ever was or can be.

<span id="vi.xiii.x-p3"></span>The words of the Prophets concerning Him,
“A Virgin shall conceive and bring forth a Son,” <span
id="fr_3277"></span>[3278](#fn_3277) are known to all, and are cited in
the Gospels again and again. The Prophet Ezekiel too had predicted the
miraculous manner of that birth, calling Mary figuratively “the Gate of
the Lord,” the gate, namely, through which the Lord entered the world.
For he saith, “The gate which looks towards the East shall be closed,
and shall not be opened, and no one shall pass through it, because the
Lord God of Israel shall pass through it, and it shall be closed.” <span
id="fr_3278"></span>[3279](#fn_3278) What could be said with such
evident reference to the inviolate preservation of the Virgin’s
condition? That Gate of Virginity was closed; through it the Lord God of
Israel entered; through it He came forth from the Virgin’s womb into
this world; and the Virgin-state being preserved inviolate, the gate of
the Virgin remained closed for ever. Therefore the Holy Ghost is spoken
of as the Creator of the Lord’s flesh and of His temple.
