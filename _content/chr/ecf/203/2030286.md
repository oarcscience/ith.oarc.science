<span id="iv.x.xcvii-p1"></span> *XCVII. To the Count Sporacius.* <span
id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813)

<span id="iv.x.xcvii-p3"></span>I am delighted with your excellency’s
letter. My pleasure has been increased by the very religious presbyter
and monk Iamblichus, who has told me of your warm zeal, your earnestness
in religion, and your real goodwill to me. On hearing of this as well as
of the efforts of the glorious and pious lord <span id="page_286">p.
286</span> <span id="iv.x.xcvii-Page_286"></span>Patricius <span
id="fr_1814"></span>[1815](#fn_1814) on my behalf I give you the
apostolic blessing which the blessed Onesiphorus obtained from that holy
tongue; “The Lord give mercy to your house, for he oft refreshed. me and
was not ashamed of my chain;” “The Lord grant unto him that he may find
mercy of the Lord in that day.” <span
id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815) This I pray for you, even though
the enemies of the truth inflict on me yet greater miseries as they
suppose; for we have been taught to regard men’s purpose; but be sure of
this, that with true religion death to me is very pleasant, and exile to
the ends of the earth. Still we are distressed at the storm of the
churches, which the Lord of all is mighty to disperse.

<span id="iv.x.xcvii-p2"></span> Sporacius or Asporacius was present at
Chalcedon in 451, as *comes domesticorum,* or one of the two commanders
of the body guard. It was at his request that Theodoret wrote his
*Hæreticarum fabularum compendium* which he dedicates “To the most
magnificent and glorious lord Sporacius my Christ-loving son.” To
Sporacius was also addressed the short treatise *“adversus Nestorium”*
of which some editors have doubted the genuineness. The present letter
may be dated in 449.
