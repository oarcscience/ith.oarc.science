II, Vol. III: Life and Works of Rufinus with Jerome's Apology Against Rufinus.: My ignorance of many natural phenomena is no excuse for your ignorance as to the origin of souls.

<p class="c24"><a name="vi.xii.iii.xxxii-p1"></A>  31. Another part of my &#145;smoke&#146; which <A NAME="page_535"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 535</FONT></A> <a name="vi.xii.iii.xxxii-Page_535"></A>you frequently laugh at is my pretence, as you say, to know what I do not know, and the parade I make of great teachers to deceive the common and ignorant people. You, of course, are a man not of smoke but of flame, or rather of lightning; you fulminate when you speak; you cannot contain the flames which have been conceived within your mouth, and like Barchochebas,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3193"></A><A HREF="#fn_3193"><FONT SIZE="1">3194</FONT></A>
 the leader of the revolt of the Jews, who used to hold in his month a lighted straw and blow it out so as to appear to be breathing forth flame: so you also, like a second Salmoneus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3194"></A><A HREF="#fn_3194"><FONT SIZE="1">3195</FONT></A>
 brighten the whole path on which you tread, and reproach us as mere men of smoke, to whom perhaps the words might be applied,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3195"></A><A HREF="#fn_3195"><FONT SIZE="1">3196</FONT></A>
 &#8220;Thou touchest the hills and they smoke.&#8221; You do not understand the allusion of the Prophet&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3196"></A><A HREF="#fn_3196"><FONT SIZE="1">3197</FONT></A>
 when he speaks of the smoke of the locusts; it is no doubt the beauty of your eyes which makes it impossible for you to bear the pungency of our smoke.</p>
