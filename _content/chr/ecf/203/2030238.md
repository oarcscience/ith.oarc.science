<span id="iv.x.xlix-p3"></span>It is the nature of mirrors to reflect
the faces of them that gaze into them, and so whoever looks at them sees
his own form. This is the same too with the pupils of the eyes, for they
shew in them the likeness of other people’s features. Of this your
holiness furnishes an instance, for you have not seen my ugliness, but
have beheld with admiration your own beauty. I really have none of the
qualities which you have mentioned. It is nevertheless my prayer that
your words may be vindicated by actual fact, and I beseech your piety by
your prayers to cause it to come to pass that your praises may not fall
to the ground through having no reality to correspond with them.

<span id="iv.x.xlix-p2"></span> At Chalcedon Damianus of Sidon voted for
the deposition of Dioscorus. (Labbe Conc. IV. 443.) In this and in the
preceding letter we find Theodoret in friendly communication with
representatives of the two antagonistic parties. The date of the
correspondence can only be conjectured.
