<span id="iv.x.xlvi-p1"></span> *XLVI. To the Learned Petrus.*

<span id="iv.x.xlvi-p2"></span>Nothing is able to stay the praiseworthy
purpose of them that highly esteem what is right. That this is the case
is confirmed by the grief shown by your magnificence at the news you
have lately received, and your refusal to overlook the attack that right
has suffered. You have opportunely put away your distress, and
righteously stopped the mouth of the enemy of the truth. No sooner did
we hear of this, and found true philosophy so coupled with rhetorical
skill, than we felt the more warmly disposed towards your excellence.
Now we beseech you the more earnestly to counteract this fine fellow’s
lies and confirm the comfort given to the unhappy poor.
