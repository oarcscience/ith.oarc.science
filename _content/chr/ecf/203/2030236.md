<span id="iv.x.xlvii-p1"></span> *XLVII. To Proclus,* <span
id="fr_1692"></span>[1693](#fn_1692) *Bishop of Constantinople.*

<span id="iv.x.xlvii-p3"></span>A year ago, thanks to your holiness, the
illustrious Philip governor of our city was delivered from serious
danger. After entering into the enjoyment of the security which he owed
to your kindness, he filled our ears with your praises. But all your
labour a certain most pious personage was endeavouring to make null and
void. The visitation made several times twelve years ago he calumniates,
and has adopted a style of slander which would be unbecoming even in a
respectable slave. Now I beseech your sanctity to put a stop to his
lies, and to induce the illustrious præfects to ratify the decision
which they duly and mercifully gave. As a matter of fact our city was
taxed more severely than all the cities of the provinces, and after
every city had been relieved ours continued to this day assessed at over
sixty-two thousand acres. At last the occupants of that seat of honour
were with difficulty in<span id="page_266">p. 266</span> <span
id="iv.x.xlvii-Page_266"></span>duced to send inspectors of the
district; their report was first received by Isidorus of famous memory
and confirmed by the glorious and Christ-loving lord Florentius, and the
whole matter was very carefully enquired into by our present ruler,
whose equity adorns the throne, and he confirmed the assessment by an
imperial decree. But this truth-loving person, all for his hatred of one
single individual, the excellent Philip, has declared war against the
poor. Under these circumstances I implore your holiness to array the
forces of your righteous eloquence against his eloquence of wrong, to
throw your shield over the truth which is attacked and at once prove her
strength and the futility of lies.
