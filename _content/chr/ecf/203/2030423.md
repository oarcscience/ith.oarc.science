<span id="v.iii.xlii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iii.xlii-p2.1"></span>Apollonius</span>, <span
id="fr_2447"></span>[2448](#fn_2447) an exceedingly talented man, wrote
against Montanus, Prisca and Maximilla a notable and lengthy volume, in
which he asserts that Montanus and his mad prophetesses died by hanging,
and many other things, among which are the following concerning Prisca
and Maximilla, “if they denied that they have accepted gifts, let them
confess that those who do accept are not prophets and I will prove by a
thousand witnesses that they have received gifts, for it is by other
fruits that prophets are shown to be prophets indeed. Tell me, does a
prophet dye his hair? Does a prophet stain her eyelids with antimony? Is
a prophet adorned with fine garments and precious stones? Does a prophet
play with dice and tables? Does he accept usury? Let them respond
whether this ought to be permitted or not, it will be my task to prove
that they do these things.” He says in the same book, that the time when
he wrote the work was the fortieth year after the beginning of the
heresy of the Cataphrygians. Tertullian added to the six volumes which
he wrote *On ecstasy* against the church a seventh, directed especially
against Apollonius, in which he attempts to defend all which Apollonius
refuted. Apollonius flourished in the reigns of Commodus and Severus.
