<span id="iv.x.xcix-p1"></span> *XCIX. To Claudianus the
Antigrapharius.* <span id="fr_1817"></span>[1818](#fn_1817)

<span id="iv.x.xcix-p3"></span>Although you have not yet met me, I think
that your excellency is aware of the open calumnies that have been
published against me, for you have often heard me preaching in church,
when I have proclaimed the Lord Jesus, and have pointed out the
properties alike of the Godhead and of the manhood; for we do not divide
one Son into two, but, worshipping the Only-begotten, point out the
distinction between flesh and Godhead. This, indeed, is I think
confessed even by the Arians, who do not call the flesh Godhead, nor
address the Godhead as flesh. Holy Scripture clearly teaches us both
natures. Nevertheless, though I have ever thus spoken, certain men are
uttering lying words against me. But I rely on my conscience and have as
witness to my teaching Him who looks into the hearts. So, as the prophet
says, I regard the contrivances of calumny as “a spider’s web.” <span
id="fr_1818"></span>[1819](#fn_1818) I await the great judgment which
needs no words, but makes manifest what in the meanwhile is unknown.

<span id="iv.x.xcix-p5"></span>I send this by the very religious
bishops, thinking it worth while to salute your excellency by them and
to remind you of your promise. For attacked as I am I do not cease to go
a-hunting, for I know that even the sacred apostles in the midst of the
assaults made upon them did not cease to ply the net of the spirit.
