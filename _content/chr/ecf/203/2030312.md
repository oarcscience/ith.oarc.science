<span id="iv.x.cxxiii"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cxxiii-p1"></span> *CXXII.* <span
id="fr_1908"></span>[1909](#fn_1908) *To Uranius* <span
id="fr_1909"></span>[1910](#fn_1909) *Bishop of Emesa.*

<span id="iv.x.cxxiii-p4"></span>I have been greatly delighted that we
who correspond in character should have corresponded by letter. But I do
not quite see what you mean by saying “Are not these my words?” If it
were said only for the sake of salutation, I am not annoyed at it; but
if it is intended to remind me of the advice which recommended silence,
and of the so-called œconomy, <span id="fr_1910"></span>[1911](#fn_1910)
I am very much obliged, but I do not accept the suggestion. For the
divine Apostle charges us to take quite the opposite course. “Be instant
in season and out of season.” <span id="fr_1911"></span>[1912](#fn_1911)
And the Lord says to this very spokesman, “Be not afraid, but
speak” <span id="fr_1912"></span>[1913](#fn_1912) and to Isaiah, “Cry
aloud, spare not” <span id="fr_1913"></span>[1914](#fn_1913) and to
Moses “Go down, charge the people” <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[1915](#fn_1914) and to Ezekiel “I have made thee a
watchman unto the house of Israel,” and it shall be “if thou warn not
the wicked,” <span id="fr_1915"></span>[1916](#fn_1915) and the like:
for I think it needless to write at length to one who knows. Not only
therefore are we not distressed at having spoken freely, but we even
rejoice and are glad, and laud Him who has thought us worthy of these
sufferings; aye and call on my friends to encounter the same perils.

<span id="iv.x.cxxiii-p11"></span>If they know that we do not keep the
apostolic rule of the faith, but swerve to the right hand or the left,
let them hate us; let them join the opposite side; let them be ranked
with them that are at war with us. But if they bear witness to our
holding the right teaching of the gospel message, we hail them with the
cry, “Do you too ‘stand having your loins girt about with truth,…and
your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace,’” <span
id="fr_1916"></span>[1917](#fn_1916) and so on, for it is said that
virtue comprises not only temperance, righteousness, and prudence, but
also courage, and that by means of courage the rest of its component
parts are preserved. For righteousness needs the alliance of courage in
its war against wrong; temperance vanquishes intemperance by the aid of
courage. And for this reason the God of all said to the prophet “The
just shall live by his faith, and if any man draw back, my soul shall
have no pleasure in him.” <span id="fr_1917"></span>[1918](#fn_1917)
Shrinking he calls cowardice. Hold fast then, my dear friend, to the
apostolic doctrines, for “He that shall come will come, and will not
tarry,” <span id="fr_1918"></span>[1919](#fn_1918) and “He shall render
to every man according to his deeds,” <span
id="fr_1919"></span>[1920](#fn_1919) for “the fashion of this world
passeth away,” <span id="fr_1920"></span>[1921](#fn_1920) and the truth
shall be made manifest.

<span id="iv.x.cxxiii-p2"></span> The two following letters are written
from the monastery at Nicerte where Theodoret found a retreat after his
banishment from Cyrus. Garnerius would place the former late in 449, and
the latter early in 450.

<span id="fn_1909"></span>[298:1910](2030312.htm#fr_1909) <span
id="iv.x.cxxiii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iv.x.cxxiii-p3"></span> Uranius, bishop of Emesa in Phœnicia,
was present at the two trials of Ibas, at Tyre in February and at
Berytus in September 448. At the Latrocinium he was accused of
immorality and of episcopal usurpation. It was during his episcopate
that the head of the Baptist was supposed to be found at Emesa. Cf.
notes on pp. 96 and 242.
