<span id="iv.x.civ-p1"></span> *CIV. To Flavianus,* <span
id="fr_1827"></span>[1828](#fn_1827) *Bishop of Constantinople.*

<span id="iv.x.civ-p3"></span>I have already in another letter informed
your holiness how openly the calumniators of our teaching are slandering
us. <span id="fr_1828"></span>[1829](#fn_1828) Now in like manner by
means of the very godly bishops I do the same, having not only these as
witnesses of the orthodoxy of my teaching but also countless other men
who are my hearers in the churches of the East. Above and beyond all
these I have my conscience, and Him who sees my conscience. And I know
too how the divine Apostle often appealed to the testimony of his
conscience, for “our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our
conscience” <span id="fr_1829"></span>[1830](#fn_1829) and again “I say
the truth in Christ I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in
the Holy Ghost.” <span id="fr_1830"></span>[1831](#fn_1830) Know then, O
holy and godly sir, that no one has ever at any time heard us preaching
two sons; in fact this doctrine seems to me abominable and impious, for
there is one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all things. Him I
acknowledge both as everlasting God and as man in the end of days, and I
give Him one worship as only begotten. I have learned however the
distinction between flesh and Godhead, for the union is unconfounded.
Thus drawn up as it were in battle array to oppose the madness of Arius
and Eunomius, we very easily refute the blasphemy hazarded by them
against the only begotten, by applying what was spoken in humility about
the Lord, and suitably to <span id="page_288">p. 288</span> <span
id="iv.x.civ-Page_288"></span>His assumed nature, to man, and, on the
other hand, what becomes the divine and signifies the divine nature, to
God; not dividing Him into two persons, but teaching that both the
former and latter attributes belong to the only begotten, the latter to
Him as God the Creator and Lord of all, and the former as made man on
our account. For divine Scripture says that He was made man, not by
mutation of the Godhead, but by assumption of human nature, of the seed
of Abraham. This the divine Apostle openly says in the words “For verily
He took not on Him the nature of angels, but He took on Him the seed of
Abraham, wherefore in all things it behoved Him to be made like unto His
brethren.” <span id="fr_1831"></span>[1832](#fn_1831) And again “Now to
Abraham and his seed were the promises made: he saith not and to seeds,
as of many; but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ.” <span
id="fr_1832"></span>[1833](#fn_1832)

<span id="iv.x.civ-p9"></span>These and similar passages have been cut
out of divine Scripture by Simon, Basilides, Valentinus, Bardesanes,
Marcion, and the man who is named after his maniacal heresy. <span
id="fr_1833"></span>[1834](#fn_1833) So they style the Master Christ God
only, and describe Him as having nothing human about Him, but appearing
in imagination and appearance as man to men. On the other hand the
Arians and Eunomians say that God the Word assumed only a body, and that
He Himself supplied the place of a soul in the body. And Apollinarius
describes the Master’s body as endued with a soul; <span
id="fr_1834"></span>[1835](#fn_1834) but, deriving, I know not whence,
the idea of a distinction between soul and intelligence, <span
id="fr_1835"></span>[1836](#fn_1835) deprives intelligence of its share
in the achieved salvation. <span id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836)
The teaching of the divine Apostles lays down on the contrary that a
soul both reasonable and intelligent was assumed together with flesh,
and the salvation of which the hope is held out to them that believe is
complete.

<span id="iv.x.civ-p14"></span>There is yet another gang of heretics who
hold differently. Photinus, <span id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837)
Marcellus, <span id="fr_1838"></span>[1839](#fn_1838) and Paul of
Samosata, <span id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839) assert that our
Lord and God was only man. When arguing with these we are under the
necessity of advancing proofs of the Godhead, and of shewing that the
Master Christ is everlasting God. When, on the other hand, we are
contending with the former faction, which calls our Lord Jesus Christ
God only, we are obliged to marshal against them the forces of the
divine Scripture, and collect from it evidence of the assumption of the
manhood. For a physician must use remedies appropriate to the disease,
and suit the medicine to the case.

<span id="iv.x.civ-p18"></span>Now, therefore, I beseech your holiness
to scatter the slander raised against me, and bridle the tongues now
vainly reviling me. For, after the incarnation, I worship one Son of
God, one Lord Jesus Christ, and denounce as impious all who hold
otherwise. Deign, sir, to give me too your holy prayers, that, by God’s
grace, I may reach the other side of the ocean of danger, and drop my
anchor in the windless haven of the Lord.
