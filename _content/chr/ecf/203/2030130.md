<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV</span>.—*Of the holy monk
Julianus*.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.iv.xxiv-p2.1"></span>At</span> this time too the celebrated
Julianus, whom I have already mentioned, was forced to leave the desert
and come to Antioch, for when the foster children of lies, the facile
framers of calumny, I mean of course the Arians, were maintaining that
this great man was of their faction, those lights of the truth
Flavianus, Diodorus, and Aphraates sent Acacius, <span
id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770) an athlete of virtue who afterwards
very wisely ruled the church at Berœa, to the famous Julianus <span
id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771) with the entreaty that he would take
pity on so many thousands of men, and at the same time convict the enemy
of lies and confirm the proclamation of the truth. The miracles worked
by Julianus on his way to and from Antioch and in that vast city itself
are described in my Religious History, which is easily accessible to all
who wish to become acquainted with them. But I am sure that no one who
has enquired into human nature will doubt that he attracted all the
population of the city to our assembly, for the extraordinary is
generally sure to draw all men after it. The fact of his having wrought
great marvels is attested even by the enemies of the truth.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxiv-p5"></span>Before this time in the reign of
Constantius the great Antonius <span id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772)
had acted in the same way in Alexandria, for he abandoned the desert and
went up and down that city, telling all men that Athanasius was the
preacher of the true doctrine and that the Arian faction were enemies of
the truth. So those godly men knew how to adapt themselves to each
particular opportunity, when to remain inactive, and at rest, and when
to leave the deserts for towns.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxiv-p4"></span> Julianus Sabas (i.e. Abba) an
ascetic solitary of Osrhoëne, the district south of the modern Harran.
He is the second of the saints of Theodoret’s “Religious History,” where
we read that he lived on millet bread, which he ate once a week, and
performed various miracles, which are recorded by Theodoret on the
authority of Acacius.

<span id="iv.viii.iv.xxiv-p6"></span> Antonius, St. Anthony, the
illustrious and illiterate ascetic, friend and correspondent of
Constantine (Soc. i. 13), the centre of many wild legends, was born in
250 <span class="c14"><span id="iv.viii.iv.xxiv-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span>
in upper Egypt. Athanasius calls him the “founder of Asceticism.” In 335
he revisited Alexandria to oppose the Arians, as narrated in the text.
He died in his cell in 355, bequeathing his “hair shirt. his two woollen
tunics, and his bed, among Amathas and Macarius who watched his last
hours, Serapion, and Athanasius.”
