deacon by bishop John the Great, at Constantinople, and a presbyter at

for women, which are still <span id="page_396">p. 396</span> <span
id="v.iv.lxiii-Page_396"></span>standing. He wrote from experience, and
in forcible language, or to speak more clearly, with meaning back of his
words, and action back of his talk. He covered the whole field of
practical directions, for monks of all sorts, in the following works:
*On dress,* also *On the canon of prayers,* and the *Usage in the saying
of Psalms,* (for these in the Egyptian monasteries, are said day and
night), three books. One of *Institutes,* eight books *On the origin,
nature and remedies for the eight principal sins,* a book on each sin.
He also compiled *Conferences* with the Egyptian fathers, as follows:
*On the aim of a monk and his creed, On discretion, On three vocations
to the service of God, On the warfare of the flesh against the spirit
and the spirit against the flesh, On the nature of all sins, On the
slaughter of the saints, On fickleness of mind, On principalities, On
the nature of prayer, On the duration of prayer, On perfection, On
chastity, On the protection of God, On the knowledge of spiritual
things, On the Divine graces, On friendship, On whether to define or not
to define, On three ancient kinds of monks and a fourth recently arisen,
On the object of cenobites and hermits, On true satisfaction in
repentance, On the remission of the Quinquagesimal fast, On nocturnal
illusions, On the saying of the apostles, “For the good which I would
do, I do not, but the evil which I would not, that I do,” On
mortification,* and finally at the request of Leo the archdeacon,
afterwards bishop of Rome, he wrote seven books against Nestorius, *On
the incarnation of the Lord,* and writing this, made an end, both of
writing and living, at Marseilles, in the reign of Theodosius and
Valentinianus.
