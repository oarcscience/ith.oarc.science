<span id="vi.xiii.xxxv-p1"></span> 34. Now let us shew briefly, if you
will, that these things were foretold by the Prophets. You will
yourself, since you are so minded, gather together more from the ample
range of the Scriptures. The Prophet Malachi says, “Behold the Lord
Almighty shall come, and who shall abide the day of His coming, or who
shall abide the sight of Him? For He doth come as the fire of a furnace
and as fuller’s soap: and He shall sit, refining and purifying as it
were gold and silver.” <span id="fr_3389"></span>[3390](#fn_3389) But
that thou mayest know more certainly Who this Lord is of Whom these
things are said, hear what the Prophet Daniel also foretells: “I saw,”
saith he, “in the vision of the night, and, behold, One like the Son of
Man coming with the clouds of heaven, and He came nigh to the Ancient of
days, and was brought near before Him; and there was given to Him
dominion, and honour, and a kingdom. And all peoples, tribes, and
languages shall serve Him. And His dominion is an eternal dominion which
shall not pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed.” <span
id="fr_3390"></span>[3391](#fn_3390) By these words we are taught not
only of His coming and judgment, but of His dominion and kingdom, that
His dominion is eternal, and His kingdom indestructible, without end; as
it is said in the Creed, <span id="fr_3391"></span>[3392](#fn_3391) “and
of His kingdom there shall be no end.” So that one who says that
Christ’s kingdom shall one day have an end is very far from the faith.
Yet it behoves us to know that the enemy is wont to counterfeit this
salutary advent of Christ with cunning fraud in order to deceive the
faithful, and in the place of the Son of Man, Who is looked for as
coming in the majesty of His Father, to prepare the Son of Perdition
with prodigies and lying signs, that instead of Christ he may introduce
Antichrist into the world; of whom the Lord Himself warned the Jews
beforehand in the Gospels, “Because I am come in My Father’s Name, and
ye received Me not, another will come in his own name, and him ye will
receive.” <span id="fr_3392"></span>[3393](#fn_3392) And again, “When ye
shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the
Prophet, standing in the holy place, let him that readeth
understand.” <span id="fr_3393"></span>[3394](#fn_3393) Daniel,
therefore, in his visions speaks very fully and amply of the coming of
that delusion: but it is not worth while to cite instances, for we have
enlarged enough already; we therefore refer any one who may wish to know
more concerning these matters to the visions themselves. The Apostle
also himself says, “Let no than deceive you by any means, for that day
shall not come except there come a falling away first, and that man of
sin be revealed, the Son of Perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself
above everything that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he
sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself as though himself were
God.” <span id="fr_3394"></span>[3395](#fn_3394) And soon afterwards,
“Then shall that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay
with the breath of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of
His coming: whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power
and signs and lying wonders.” <span id="fr_3395"></span>[3396](#fn_3395)
And <span id="page_557">p. 557</span> <span
id="vi.xiii.xxxv-Page_557"></span>again, shortly afterwards, “And
therefore the Lord shall send unto them strong delusion, that they may
believe a lie, that all may be judged who have not believed the
truth.” <span id="fr_3396"></span>[3397](#fn_3396) For this reason,
therefore, is this “delusion” foretold unto us by the words of Prophets,
Evangelists, and Apostles, lest any one should mistake the coming of
Antichrist for the coming of Christ. But as the Lord Himself says, “When
they shall say unto you, lo, here is Christ, or lo, He is there, believe
it not. For many false Christs and false prophets shall come and shall
seduce many.” <span id="fr_3397"></span>[3398](#fn_3397) But let us see
how He hath pointed out the judgment of the true Christ: “As the
lightning shineth from the east unto the west, so shall the coming of
the Son of Man be.” <span id="fr_3398"></span>[3399](#fn_3398) When,
therefore, the true Lord Jesus Christ shall come, He will sit and set up
his throne of judgment. As also He says in the Gospel, “He shall
separate the sheep from the goats,” <span
id="fr_3399"></span>[3400](#fn_3399) that is, the righteous from the
unrighteous; as the Apostle writes, “We must all stand before the
judgment-seat of Christ, that every man may receive the awards due to
the body, according as he hath done, whether they be good or
evil.” <span id="fr_3400"></span>[3401](#fn_3400) Moreover, the judgment
will be not only for deeds, but for thoughts also, as the same Apostle
saith, “Their thoughts mutually accusing or else excusing one another,
in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men.” <span
id="fr_3401"></span>[3402](#fn_3401) But on these points let this
suffice. Next follows in the order of the faith,—

Constantinopolitan, or, more probably, that of Jerusalem, with which
Rufinus, as a Presbyter of that church, must have been familiar. There
is no reason to suppose that the clause was in the Creed of Aquileia.
