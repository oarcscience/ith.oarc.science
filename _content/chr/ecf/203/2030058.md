<span id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*Paulus, Bishop of
Constantinople*.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>Paulus <span
id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461) </span>, bishop of Constantinople, who
faithfully maintained orthodox doctrines, was accused by the unsound
Arians of exciting seditions, and of such other crimes as they usually
laid to the charge of all those who preached true piety. The people, who
feared the machinations of his enemies, would not permit him to go to
Sardica. The Arians, taking advantage of the weakness of the emperor,
procured from him an edict of banishment against Paulus, who was,
accordingly, sent to Cucusus, a little town formerly included in
Cappadocia, but now in Lesser Armenia. But these disturbers of the
public peace were not satisfied with having driven the admirable Paulus
into a desert. They sent the agents of their cruelty to despatch him by
a violent death. St. Athanasius testifies to this fact in the defence
which he wrote of his own flight. He uses the following words <span
id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462) : “They pursued Paulus, bishop of
Constantinople, and having seized him at Cucusus, a city of Cappadocia,
they had him strangled, using as their executioner Philippus the
prefect, who was the protector of their heresy, and the active agent of
their most atrocious projects <span id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463) .”

<span id="iv.viii.ii.iv-p6"></span>Such were the murders to which the
blasphemy of Arius gave rise. Their mad rage against the Only-begotten
was matched by cruel deeds against His servants.
