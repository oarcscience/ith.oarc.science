<span id="v.iv.xl-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="v.iv.xl-p2.1"></span>Augustine, <span
id="fr_2635"></span>[2636](#fn_2635) </span> of Africa, bishop of
Hipporegensis, a man renowned throughout the world for learning both
sacred and secular, unblemished in the faith, pure in life, wrote works
so many that they cannot all be gathered. For who is there that can
boast himself of having all his works, or who reads with such diligence
as to read all he has written? <span
id="fr_2636"></span>[2637](#fn_2636) As an old man even, he published
fifteen books *On the Trinity* which he had begun as a young man. In
which, as scripture says, brought into the chamber of the king and
adorned with the manifold garment of the wisdom of God, he exhibited a
church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing. In his work *On the
incarnation of the Lord* also he manifested a peculiar piety. On the
resurrection of the dead he wrote with equal sincerity, and left it to
the less able to raise doubts respecting abortions. <span

25 Fabr. add “wherefore on account of his much speaking Solomon’s saying
came true that *‘In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin.’*”
This expression in the editions has been the ground of much comment on
Gennadius’ Semi-pelagian bias, but it almost certainly does not
represent the original form of the text.

matter; a adds *remained a catholic*; 30 adds *remained a catholic and
died in the same city—the city which is still called Hypporegensis;*
while 25 adds a vast amount.
