<p class="c31"><a name="v.ii.v-p2"></A>An early translation of Jerome&#146;s work into Greek was made by Sophronius and used by Photius. A translation purporting to be his is given by Erasmus. There has been a good deal of controversy over this, some even accusing Erasmus of having forged it entire. It is an open question with a general tendency to give Erasmus the benefit of the doubt. The present translator while holding his judgment ready to be corrected by the finding of a <span class="c14"><a name="v.ii.v-p2.1"></A>ms</span>. or other evidence, inclines to reject <i>in toto,</i> regarding it as for the most part trans<A NAME="page_356"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 356</FONT></A> <a name="v.ii.v-Page_356"></A>lated by Erasmus from some South German or Swiss <span class="c14"><a name="v.ii.v-p2.2"></A>ms</span>., or, if that be not certain, at least that the translation is too little established to be of any use for textual purposes. There is a modern translation of select words of Jerome in French by Matougues. The chief sources for comparison used by the translator have been Sophronius (or Erasmus) Matougues, M&#146;Giffert&#146;s Eusebius for the first part of Jerome where he takes so liberally from Eusebius, and scattered selections here and there in Ceillier, Smith and Wace, <i>Dict.</i> and other literary-historical works.</p>
