<span id="vi.xii.iii.ii"></span>

<span id="vi.xii.iii.ii-p1"></span> I have read the letter <span
id="fr_3145"></span>[3146](#fn_3145) which you in your wisdom have
written me. You inveigh against me, and, though you once praised me and
called me true partner and brother, you now write books to summon me to
reply to the charges with which you terrify me. I see that in you are
fulfilled the words of Solomon: <span
id="fr_3146"></span>[3147](#fn_3146) “In the mouth of the foolish is the
rod of <span id="fr_3147"></span>[3148](#fn_3147) contumely,” and <span
id="fr_3148"></span>[3149](#fn_3148) “A fool receives not the words of
prudence, unless you say what is passing in his heart;” and the words of
Isaiah: <span id="fr_3149"></span>[3150](#fn_3149) “The fool will speak
folly, and his heart will understand vain things, to practise iniquity
and speak falsehood against the Lord.” For what need was there for you
to send me whole volumes full of accusation and malediction, and to
bring them before the public, when in the end of your letter you
threaten me with death if I dare to reply to your slanders—I beg
pardon—to your praises? For your praises and your accusations amount to
the same thing; from the same fountain proceed both sweet and bitter. I
beg you to set me the example of the modesty and shamefacedness which
you recommend to me; you accuse another of lying: cease to be a liar
yourself. I wish to give no one an occasion of stumbling, and I will not
become your accuser; for I have not to consider merely what you deserve
but what is becoming in me. I tremble at our Savior’s words. <span
id="fr_3150"></span>[3151](#fn_3150) “Whosoever shall cause one of these
little ones that believe in me to stumble, it were better for him that a
great mill stone were hanged about his neck and he were drowned in the
depths of the sea;” and <span id="fr_3151"></span>[3152](#fn_3151) “Woe
unto the world because of occasions of stumbling: for it must needs be
that occasions arise; but woe to the man through whom the occasion
cometh.” It would have been possible for me too to pile up falsehoods
against you and to say that I had heard or seen what no one had
observed, so that among the ignorant my effrontery might be taken for
veracity, and my violence for resolution. But far be it from me to be an
imitator of you, and to do myself what I denounce in you. He who is
capable of doing filthy things may use filthy words. <span
id="fr_3152"></span>[3153](#fn_3152) “The evil man out of the evil
treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil; for out of the
abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” You may count it as good
fortune that one whom you once called friend but now accuse has no mind
to make vile imputations against you. I say this not from any dread of
the sword of your accusation, but because I prefer to be accused than to
be the accuser, to suffer an injury than to do one. I know the precept
of the Apostle: <span id="fr_3153"></span>[3154](#fn_3153) “Dearly
beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath: for it
is written Vengeance is mine, I will repay saith the Lord. Therefore, if
thine enemy hunger feed him, if he thirst give him drink; for in so
doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.” For he that avenges
himself cannot claim the vindication of the Lord.
