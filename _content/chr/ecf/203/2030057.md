<span id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*Second Exile of St.
Athanasius.—Ordination and Death of Gregorius*.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p2"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p2.1"></span>With</span> these and similar arguments,
the bishops assailed the weak-minded emperor, and persuaded him to expel
Athanasius from his church. But Athanasius obtained timely intimation of
their design, and departed to the west. <span
id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455) The friends of Eusebius had sent false
accusations against him to Julius, who was then bishop of Rome <span
id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456) . In obedience to the laws of the
church, Julius summoned the accusers and the accused to Rome, that the
cause might be tried <span id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457) .
Athanasius, accordingly, set out for Rome, but the calumniators refused
to go because they saw that their falsehood would easily be
detected <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458) . But perceiving that
the flock of Athanasius was left without a pastor, they appointed over
it a wolf instead of a shepherd. Gregorius, for this was his name,
surpassed the wild beasts in his deeds of cruelty towards the flock: but
at the expiration of six years he was destroyed by the sheep themselves.
Athanasius went to Constans (Constantine, the eldest brother, having
fallen in battle), and complained of the plots laid against him by the
Arians, and of their opposition to the apostolical faith <span
id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459) . He reminded him of his father, and
how he attended in person the great and famous council which he had
summoned; how he was present at its debates, took part in framing its
decrees, and confirmed them by law. The emperor was moved to emulation
by his father’s zeal, and promptly wrote to his brother, exhorting him
to preserve inviolate the religion of their father, which they had
inherited; “for,” he urged, “by piety he made his empire great,
destroyed the tyrants of Rome, and subjugated the foreign nations on
every side.” Constantius was led by this letter to summon the bishops
from the east and from the west to Sardica <span
id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460) , a city of Illyricum, and the
metropolis of Dacia, that they might deliberate on the means of removing
<span id="page_67">p. 67</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ii.iii-Page_67"></span>the other troubles of the church,
which were many and pressing.

confirmed at the Council of Antioch, <span class="c14"><span

<span id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p4"></span> They were met by a deputation of
Athanasians, bringing the encyclical of the Egyptian Bishops in favour
of the accused. *Apol. Cont. Ar.* §3.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p5"></span> On the bearing of these
communications with Rome on the question of Papal jurisdiction, vide
Salmon, *Infallibility of the Church,* p. 405. Cf. Wladimir Guettée,
*Histoire de l’Eglise,* III. p. 112.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[66:459](2030057.htm#fr_458) <span
id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p6"></span> The innocence of Athanasius was
vindicated at the Council held at Rome in Nov. <span class="c14"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> 341.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p7"></span> For the violent resentment of the
Alexandrian Church at the obtrusion of Gregorius, an Ultra-Arian, and
apparently an illustration of the old proverb of the three bad Kappas,
“<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p7.1"></span>Καππάδοκες</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p7.2"></span>,</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p7.3"></span>Κρῆτες</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p7.4"></span>,</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p7.5"></span>Κίλικες</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p7.6"></span>,</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p7.7"></span>τρία κάππα
κάκιστα</span>,” for he was a Cappadocian—vide Ath. *Encyc.* 3, 4,
*Hist. Ar.* 10. The sequence of events is not without difficulty, and
our author gives here little help. Athanasius was in Alexandria in the
spring of 340, when Gregorius made his entry, and started for Rome at or
about Easter. Constantine II. was defeated and slain by the troops of
his brother Constans, in the neighbourhood of Aquileia, and his corpse
found in the river Alsa, in April, 340. Athanasius remained at Rome till
the summer of 343, when he was summoned to Milan by Constans (*Ap. ad
Const*. 3, 4).

<span id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p8"></span>Results of his visit to Rome were
the adherence of Latin Christianity to the orthodox opinion (Cf. Milman,
*Hist. of Lat. Christianity,* vol. i. p. 78), and the introduction of
Monachism into the West. Vide Robertson’s *Ch. Hist.* ii. 6.

<span id="iv.viii.ii.iii-p9"></span> Now Sophia, in Bulgaria. The centre
of Mœsia was called Dacia Cis-Danubiana, when the tract conquered by
Trajan was abandoned.
