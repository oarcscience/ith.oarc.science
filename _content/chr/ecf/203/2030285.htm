<p class="c46"><a name="iv.x.xcvi-p1"></A>  <i>XCVI. To Nomus the Patrician.</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1808"></A><A HREF="#fn_1808"><FONT SIZE="1">1809</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.xcvi-p3"></A>I have written to you two letters, indeed I think three, but without getting any answer. I had wished to say no more, but to know my own place and the greatness of dignities, and to beg you to inform me of the cause of your silence. Really I do not know what offence I can have given to your excellency. We err unwillingly as well as willingly, and sometimes are quite ignorant in what way we are transgressing. I therefore beg your greatness, remembering the divine laws which plainly charge us &#8220;If thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between him and thee alone&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1809"></A><A HREF="#fn_1809"><FONT SIZE="1">1810</FONT></A>
 to deign to make plain to me the origin of the annoyance, that I may either prove myself innocent, or, made aware of where I was wrong, may beg your pardon. In my confidence in the evidence of my conscience I hope for the former. All men are adorned by magnanimity, and not least those who, following the example of your excellency, trained in outside education as well as instructed in divine principles, both hear the apostolic laws loudly exclaiming &#8220;Let not the sun go down upon your wrath&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1810"></A><A HREF="#fn_1810"><FONT SIZE="1">1811</FONT></A>
 and remember the words of Homer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1811"></A><A HREF="#fn_1811"><FONT SIZE="1">1812</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c59"><a name="iv.x.xcvi-p7"></A>&#8220;In fit bounds contain thy mighty mind;</p>  
<p class="c60"><a name="iv.x.xcvi-p8"></A>Benignity is best.&#8221;</p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.xcvi-p9"></A>I have thus written not as though giving you information, but to remind one who is much occupied, and I do so in remembrance of the law of the Lord, who says &#8220;Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1812"></A><A HREF="#fn_1812"><FONT SIZE="1">1813</FONT></A>
 In obedience to these words I have thought it right to salute your excellency by the most pious bishops, and to exhort you to give heed to the tranquillity of the churches. They are indeed overwhelmed by a great storm.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.x.xcvi-p2"></A> cf. Letters LVIII and LXXXI. Nomus the consul and Nomus the patrician are distinguished in Schulze&#146;s Index to the Letters, but there seems no reason to doubt their identity. Nomus the powerful minister of Theodosius II. was consul in 445 and patrician in 449, to which year this third letter may be referred.</p>
