<span id="iv.x.lxix-p1"></span> *LXIX. To Eugraphia.* <span
id="fr_1712"></span>[1713](#fn_1712)

<span id="iv.x.lxix-p3"></span>Had I not been unavoidably prevented, I
should no sooner have heard that your great and glorious husband had
fallen asleep than I should straightway have hurried to your side. I
have enjoyed at your hands many and various kinds of honour, and I owe
you full many thanks. When hindered, much against my will, from paying
my debt, I deemed it ill-advised to send you a letter at <span
id="page_270">p. 270</span> <span id="iv.x.lxix-Page_270"></span>the
very moment, when your grief was at its height; when it was impossible
for my messenger to approach your excellency, and when grief prevented
you from reading what I wrote. But now that your reason has had time to
wake from the intoxication of grief, to repress your emotion, and to
discipline the license of sorrow, I have made bold to write and to
beseech your excellency to bethink you of human nature, to reflect how
common is the loss you deplore, and, above all, to accept the divine
teaching, and not let your distress go beyond the bounds of your faith.
For your most excellent husband, as the Lord Himself said, “is not dead
but sleepeth” <span id="fr_1713"></span>[1714](#fn_1713) —a sleep a
little longer than he was wont. This hope has been given us by the Lord;
this promise we have received from the divine oracles. I know indeed how
distressing is the separation, how most distressing; and especially so
when affection is made stronger by sympathy of character and length of
time. But let your grief be for a journey into a far country, not for a
life ended. This kind of philosophy is particularly becoming to them
that be brought up in piety, and it is of this philosophy that I beseech
you, my respected friend, to seek the adornment. And I do not offer you
this advice as a man labouring himself under insensibility; in truth my
heart was grieved when I learnt of the departure of one I loved so well.
But I call to mind the Ruler of the world and His unspeakable wisdom,
which ordains everything for our good. I implore your holiness to take
these reflections to heart, to rise superior to your sorrow, and praise
God who is the Master of us all. It is with ineffable providence that He
guides the lives of men.
