<span id="iv.x.xcvi-p1"></span> *XCVI. To Nomus the Patrician.* <span
id="fr_1808"></span>[1809](#fn_1808)

<span id="iv.x.xcvi-p3"></span>I have written to you two letters, indeed
I think three, but without getting any answer. I had wished to say no
more, but to know my own place and the greatness of dignities, and to
beg you to inform me of the cause of your silence. Really I do not know
what offence I can have given to your excellency. We err unwillingly as
well as willingly, and sometimes are quite ignorant in what way we are
transgressing. I therefore beg your greatness, remembering the divine
laws which plainly charge us “If thy brother shall trespass against thee
go and tell him his fault between him and thee alone” <span
id="fr_1809"></span>[1810](#fn_1809) to deign to make plain to me the
origin of the annoyance, that I may either prove myself innocent, or,
made aware of where I was wrong, may beg your pardon. In my confidence
in the evidence of my conscience I hope for the former. All men are
adorned by magnanimity, and not least those who, following the example
of your excellency, trained in outside education as well as instructed
in divine principles, both hear the apostolic laws loudly exclaiming
“Let not the sun go down upon your wrath” <span
id="fr_1810"></span>[1811](#fn_1810) and remember the words of
Homer <span id="fr_1811"></span>[1812](#fn_1811)

<span id="iv.x.xcvi-p7"></span>“In fit bounds contain thy mighty mind;

<span id="iv.x.xcvi-p8"></span>Benignity is best.”

<span id="iv.x.xcvi-p9"></span>I have thus written not as though giving
you information, but to remind one who is much occupied, and I do so in
remembrance of the law of the Lord, who says “Therefore if thou bring
thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought
against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way;
first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy
gift.” <span id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812) In obedience to these
words I have thought it right to salute your excellency by the most
pious bishops, and to exhort you to give heed to the tranquillity of the
churches. They are indeed overwhelmed by a great storm.

<span id="iv.x.xcvi-p2"></span> cf. Letters LVIII and LXXXI. Nomus the
consul and Nomus the patrician are distinguished in Schulze’s Index to
the Letters, but there seems no reason to doubt their identity. Nomus
the powerful minister of Theodosius II. was consul in 445 and patrician
in 449, to which year this third letter may be referred.
