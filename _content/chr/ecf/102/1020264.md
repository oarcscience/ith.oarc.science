<span id="iv.IX.17-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.IX.17-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—That to Obtain the Blessed Life,
Which Consists in Partaking of the Supreme Good, Man Needs Such
Mediation as is Furnished Not by a Demon, But by Christ Alone.</span>

<span id="iv.IX.17-p2"></span>I am considerably surprised that such
learned men, men who pronounce all material and sensible things to be
altogether inferior to those that are spiritual and intelligible, should
mention bodily contact in connection with the blessed life.  Is that
sentiment of Plotinus forgotten?—“We must fly to our beloved
fatherland.  There is the Father, there our all.  What fleet or flight
shall convey us thither?  Our way is, to become like God.” <span
id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353)   If, then, one is nearer to God the
liker he is to Him, there is no other distance from God than unlikeness
to Him.  And the <span id="page_176">p. 176</span> <span
id="iv.IX.17-Page_176"></span> soul of man is unlike that incorporeal
and unchangeable and eternal essence, in proportion as it craves things
temporal and mutable.  And as the things beneath, which are mortal and
impure, cannot hold intercourse with the immortal purity which is above,
a mediator is indeed needed to remove this difficulty; but not a
mediator who resembles the highest order of being by possessing an
immortal body, and the lowest by having a diseased soul, which makes him
rather grudge that we be healed than help our cure.  We need a Mediator
who, being united to us here below by the mortality of His body, should
at the same time be able to afford us truly divine help in cleansing and
liberating us by means of the immortal righteousness of His spirit,
whereby He remained heavenly even while here upon earth.  Far be it from
the incontaminable God to fear pollution from the man <span
id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354) He assumed, or from the men among whom
He lived in the form of a man.  For, though His incarnation showed us
nothing else, these two wholesome facts were enough, that true divinity
cannot be polluted by flesh, and that demons are not to be considered
better than ourselves because they have not flesh. <span
id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355)   This, then, as Scripture says, is
the “Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus,” <span
id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356) of whose divinity, whereby He is equal
to the Father, and humanity, whereby He has become like us, this is not
the place to speak as fully as I could.
