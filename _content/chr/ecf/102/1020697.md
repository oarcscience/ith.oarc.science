<span id="v.iv.i-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.iv.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—The Interpretation of Scripture
Depends on the Discovery and Enunciation of the Meaning, and is to Be
Undertaken in Dependence on God’s Aid.</span>

<span id="v.iv.i-p2"></span>1.  <span class="c20"><span
id="v.iv.i-p2.1"></span>There</span> are two things on which all
interpretation of Scripture depends:  the mode of ascertaining the
proper meaning, and the mode of making known the meaning when it is
ascertained.  We shall treat first of the mode of ascertaining, next of
the mode of making known, the meaning;—a great and arduous undertaking,
and one that, if difficult to carry out, it is, I fear, presumptuous to
enter upon.  And presumptuous it would undoubtedly be, if I were
counting on my own strength; but since my hope of accomplishing the work
rests on Him who has already supplied me with many thoughts on this
subject, I do not fear but that He will go on to supply what is yet
wanting when once I have begun to use what He has already given.  For a
possession which is not diminished by being shared with others, if it is
possessed and not shared, is not yet possessed as it <span
id="page_523">p. 523</span> <span id="v.iv.i-Page_523"></span> ought to
be possessed.  The Lord saith “Whosoever hath, to him shall be
given.” <span id="fr_1716"></span>[1717](#fn_1716)   He will give, then,
to those who have; that is to say, if they use freely and cheerfully
what they have received, He will add to and perfect His gifts.  The
loaves in the miracle were only five and seven in number before the
disciples began to divide them among the hungry people.  But when once
they began to distribute them, though the wants of so many thousands
were satisfied, they filled baskets with the fragments that were
left. <span id="fr_1717"></span>[1718](#fn_1717)   Now, just as that
bread increased in the very act of breaking it, so those thoughts which
the Lord has already vouchsafed to me with a view to undertaking this
work will, as soon as I begin to impart them to others, be multiplied by
His grace, so that, in this very work of distribution in which I have
engaged, so far from incurring loss and poverty, I shall be made to
rejoice in a marvellous increase of wealth.
