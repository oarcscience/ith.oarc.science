<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XIII.10-p2"></A>For no sooner do we begin to live in this dying body, than we begin to move ceaselessly towards death.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_589"></A><A HREF="#fn_589"><FONT SIZE="1">590</FONT></A>
&#160; For in the whole course of this life (if life we must call it) its mutability tends towards death.&#160; Certainly there is no one who is not nearer it this year than last year, and to-morrow than to-day, and to-day than yesterday, and a short while hence than now, and now than a short while ago.&#160; For whatever time we live is deducted from our whole term of life, and that which remains is daily becoming less and less; so that our whole life is nothing but a race towards death, in which no one is allowed to stand still for a little space, or to go somewhat more slowly, but all are driven forwards with an impartial movement, and with equal rapidity.&#160; For he whose life is short spends a day no more swiftly than he whose life is longer.&#160; But while the equal moments are impartially snatched from both, the one has a nearer and the other a more remote goal to reach with this their equal speed.&#160; It is one thing to make a longer journey, and another to walk more slowly.&#160; He, therefore, who spends longer time on his way to death does not proceed at a more leisurely pace, but goes over more ground.&#160; Further, if every man begins to die, that is, is in death, as soon as death has begun to show itself in him (by taking away life, to wit; for when life is all taken away, the man will be then not in death, but after death), then he begins to die so soon as he begins to live.&#160; For what else is going on in all his days, hours, and moments, until this slow-working death is fully consummated?&#160; And then comes the time <i>after death</i>, instead of that in which life was being withdrawn, and which we called being <i>in death</i>.&#160; Man, then, is never in life from the moment he dwells in this dying rather than living body,&#8212;if, at least, he cannot be in life and death at once.&#160; Or rather, shall we say, he is in both?&#8212;in life, namely, which he lives till all is consumed; but in death also, which he dies as his life is consumed?&#160; For if he is not in life, what is it which is consumed till all be gone?&#160; And if he is not in death, what is this consumption itself?&#160; For when the whole of life has been consumed, the expression &#8220;after death&#8221; would be meaningless, had that consumption not been death.&#160; And if, when it has all been consumed, a man is not in death but after death, when is he in death unless when life is being consumed away?</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.XIII.10-p3"></A> Much of this paradoxical statement about death is taken from Seneca.&#160; See, among other places, his epistle on the premeditation of future dangers, the passage beginning, <i>Quotidie morimur, quotide enim demitur aliqua pars vit&aelig;</i>.</p>
