<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XX.9-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XX.9-p1.1"></A>Chapter 9.&#8212;What the Reign of the Saints with Christ for a Thousand Years Is, and How It Differs from the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XX.9-p2"></A>But while the devil is bound, the saints reign with Christ during the same thousand years, understood in the same way, that is, of the time of His first coming.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1353"></A><A HREF="#fn_1353"><FONT SIZE="1">1354</FONT></A>
&#160; For, leaving out of account that kingdom concerning which He shall say in the end, &#8220;Come, ye blessed of my Father, take possession of the kingdom prepared for you,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1354"></A><A HREF="#fn_1354"><FONT SIZE="1">1355</FONT></A>
 the Church could not now be called His kingdom or the kingdom of heaven unless His saints were even now reigning with Him, though in another and far different way; for to His saints He says, &#8220;Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1355"></A><A HREF="#fn_1355"><FONT SIZE="1">1356</FONT></A>
&#160; Certainly it is in this present time that the scribe well instructed in the kingdom of God, and of whom we have already spoken, brings forth from his  <A NAME="page_430"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 430</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XX.9-Page_430"></A>  treasure things new and old.&#160; And from the Church those reapers shall gather out the tares which He suffered to grow with the wheat till the harvest, as He explains in the words &#8220;The harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.&#160; As therefore the tares are gathered together and burned with fire, so shall it be in the end of the world.&#160; The Son of man shall send His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all offenses.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1356"></A><A HREF="#fn_1356"><FONT SIZE="1">1357</FONT></A>
&#160; Can He mean out of that kingdom in which are no offenses?&#160; Then it must be out of His present kingdom, the Church, that they are gathered.&#160; So He says, &#8220;He that breaketh one of the least of these commandments, and teacheth men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven:&#160; but he that doeth and teacheth thus shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1357"></A><A HREF="#fn_1357"><FONT SIZE="1">1358</FONT></A>
&#160; He speaks of both as being in the kingdom of heaven, both the man who does not perform the commandments which He teaches,&#8212;for &#8220;to break&#8221; means not to keep, not to perform,&#8212;and the man who does and teaches as He did; but the one He calls least, the other great.&#160; And He immediately adds, &#8220;For I say unto you, that except your righteousness exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees,&#8221;&#8212;that is, the righteousness of those who break what they teach; for of the scribes and Pharisees He elsewhere says, &#8220;For they say and do not;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1358"></A><A HREF="#fn_1358"><FONT SIZE="1">1359</FONT></A>
&#8212;unless therefore, your righteousness exceed theirs that is, so that you do not break but rather do what you teach, &#8220;ye shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1359"></A><A HREF="#fn_1359"><FONT SIZE="1">1360</FONT></A>
&#160; We must understand in one sense the kingdom of heaven in which exist together both he who breaks what he teaches and he who does it, the one being least, the other great, and in another sense the kingdom of heaven into which only he who does what he teaches shall enter.&#160; Consequently, where both classes exist, it is the Church as it now is, but where only the one shall exist, it is the Church as it is destined to be when no wicked person shall be in her.&#160; Therefore the Church even now is the kingdom of Christ, and the kingdom of heaven.&#160; Accordingly, even now His saints reign with Him, though otherwise than as they shall reign hereafter; and yet, though the tares grow in the Church along with the wheat, they do not reign with Him.&#160; For they reign with Him who do what the apostle says, &#8220;If ye be risen with Christ, mind the things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God.&#160; Seek those things which are above, not the things which are on the earth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1360"></A><A HREF="#fn_1360"><FONT SIZE="1">1361</FONT></A>
&#160; Of such persons he also says that their conversation is in heaven.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1361"></A><A HREF="#fn_1361"><FONT SIZE="1">1362</FONT></A>
&#160; In fine, they reign with Him who are so in His kingdom that they themselves are His kingdom.&#160; But in what sense are those the kingdom of Christ who, to say no more, though they are in it until all offenses are gathered out of it at the end of the world, yet seek their own things in it, and not the things that are Christ&#146;s?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1362"></A><A HREF="#fn_1362"><FONT SIZE="1">1363</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XX.9-p13"></A>It is then of this kingdom militant, in which conflict with the enemy is still maintained, and war carried on with warring lusts, or government laid upon them as they yield, until we come to that most peaceful kingdom in which we shall reign without an enemy, and it is of this first resurrection in the present life, that the Apocalypse speaks in the words just quoted.&#160; For, after saying that the devil is bound a thousand years and is afterwards loosed for a short season, it goes on to give a sketch of what the Church does or of what is done in the Church in those days, in the words, &#8220;And I saw seats and them that sat upon them, and judgment was given.&#8221;&#160; It is not to be supposed that this refers to the last judgment, but to the seats of the rulers and to the rulers themselves by whom the Church is now governed.&#160; And no better interpretation of judgment being given can be produced than that which we have in the words, &#8220;What ye bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what ye loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1363"></A><A HREF="#fn_1363"><FONT SIZE="1">1364</FONT></A>
&#160; Whence the apostle says, &#8220;What have I to do with judging them that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1364"></A><A HREF="#fn_1364"><FONT SIZE="1">1365</FONT></A>
&#160; &#8220;And the souls,&#8221; says John, &#8220;of those who were slain for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God,&#8221;&#8212;understanding what he afterwards says, &#8220;reigned with Christ a thousand years,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1365"></A><A HREF="#fn_1365"><FONT SIZE="1">1366</FONT></A>
&#8212;that is, the souls of the martyrs not yet restored to their bodies.&#160; For the souls of the pious dead are not separated from the Church, which even now is the kingdom of Christ; otherwise there would be no remembrance made of them at the altar of God in the partaking of the body of Christ, nor would it do any good in danger to run to His baptism, that we might not pass from this life without it; nor to reconciliation, if by penitence or a bad conscience any one may be severed from His body.&#160; For why are these things practised, if not because the faithful, even though dead, are His members?&#160; Therefore, while these thousand years run on, their souls reign with Him, though not as yet in conjunction with  <A NAME="page_431"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 431</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XX.9-Page_431"></A>  their bodies.&#160; And therefore in another part of this same book we read, &#8220;Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth and now, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works do follow them.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1366"></A><A HREF="#fn_1366"><FONT SIZE="1">1367</FONT></A>
&#160; The Church, then, begins its reign with Christ now in the living and in the dead.&#160; For, as the apostle says, &#8220;Christ died that He might be Lord both of the living and of the dead.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1367"></A><A HREF="#fn_1367"><FONT SIZE="1">1368</FONT></A>
&#160; But he mentioned the souls of the martyrs only, because they who have contended even to death for the truth, themselves principally reign after death; but, taking the part for the whole, we understand the words of all others who belong to the Church, which is the kingdom of Christ.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XX.9-p19"></A>As to the words following, &#8220;And if any have not worshipped the beast nor his image, nor have received his inscription on their forehead, or on their hand,&#8221; we must take them of both the living and the dead.&#160; And what this beast is, though it requires a more careful investigation, yet it is not inconsistent with the true faith to understand it of the ungodly city itself, and the community of unbelievers set in opposition to the faithful people and the city of God.&#160; &#8220;His image&#8221; seems to me to mean his simulation, to wit, in those men who profess to believe, but live as unbelievers.&#160; For they pretend to be what they are not, and are called Christians, not from a true likeness but from a deceitful image.&#160; For to this beast belong not only the avowed enemies of the name of Christ and His most glorious city, but also the tares which are to be gathered out of His kingdom, the Church, in the end of the world.&#160; And who are they who do not worship the beast and his image, if not those who do what the apostle says, &#8220;Be not yoked with unbelievers?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1368"></A><A HREF="#fn_1368"><FONT SIZE="1">1369</FONT></A>
&#160; For such do not worship, <i>i.e</i>., do not consent, are not subjected; neither do they receive the inscription, the brand of crime, on their forehead by their profession, on their hand by their practice.&#160; They, then, who are free from these pollutions, whether they still live in this mortal flesh, or are dead, reign with Christ even now, through this whole interval which is indicated by the thousand years, in a fashion suited to this time.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XX.9-p21"></A>&#8220;The rest of them,&#8221; he says, &#8220;did not live.&#8221;&#160; For now is the hour when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live; and the rest of them shall not live.&#160; The words added, &#8220;until the thousand years are finished,&#8221; mean that they did not live in the time in which they ought to have lived by passing from death to life.&#160; And therefore, when the day of the bodily resurrection arrives, they shall come out of their graves, not to life, but to judgment, namely, to damnation, which is called the second death.&#160; For whosoever has not lived until the thousand years be finished, <i>i.e</i>., during this whole time in which the first resurrection is going on,&#8212;whosoever has not heard the voice of the Son of God, and passed from death to life,&#8212;that man shall certainly in the second resurrection, the resurrection of the flesh, pass with his flesh into the second death.&#160; For he goes to say &#8220;This is the first resurrection.&#160; Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection,&#8221; or who experiences it.&#160; Now he experiences it who not only revives from the death of sin, but continues in this renewed life.&#160; &#8220;In these the second death hath no power.&#8221;&#160; Therefore it has power in the rest, of whom he said above, &#8220;The rest of them did not live until the thousand years were finished;&#8221; for in this whole intervening time called a thousand years, however lustily they lived in the body, they were not quickened to life out of that death in which their wickedness held them, so that by this revived life they should become partakers of the first resurrection, and so the second death should have no power over them.</p>
