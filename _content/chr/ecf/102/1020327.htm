<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XI.23-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XI.23-p1.1"></A>Chapter 23.&#8212;Of the Error in Which the Doctrine of Origen is Involved.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XI.23-p2"></A>But it is much more surprising that some even of those who, with ourselves, believe that there is one only source of all things, and that no nature which is not divine can exist unless originated by that Creator, have yet refused to accept with a good and simple faith this so good and simple a reason of the world&#146;s creation, that a good God made it good; and that the things created, being different from God, were inferior to Him, and yet were good, being created by none other than He.&#160; But they say that souls, though not, indeed, parts of God, but created by Him, sinned by abandoning God; that, in proportion to their various sins, they merited different degrees of debasement from heaven to earth, and diverse bodies as prison-houses; and that this is the world, and this the cause of its creation, not the production of good things, but the restraining of evil.&#160; Origen is justly blamed for holding this opinion.&#160; For in the books which he entitles <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.XI.23-p2.1"></A>&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#945;&#961;&#967;&#8182;&#957;</span>, that is, <i>Of Origins</i>, this is his sentiment, this his utterance.&#160; And I can  <A NAME="page_218"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 218</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XI.23-Page_218"></A>  not sufficiently express my astonishment, that a man so erudite and well versed in ecclesiastical literature, should not have observed, in the first place, how opposed this is to the meaning of this authoritative Scripture, which, in recounting all the works of God, regularly adds, &#8220;And God saw that it was good;&#8221; and, when all were completed, inserts the words, &#8220;And God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_495"></A><A HREF="#fn_495"><FONT SIZE="1">496</FONT></A>
&#160; Was it not obviously meant to be understood that there was no other cause of the world&#146;s creation than that good creatures should be made by a good God?&#160; In this creation, had no one sinned, the world would have been filled and beautified with natures good without exception; and though there is sin, all things are not therefore full of sin, for the great majority of the heavenly inhabitants preserve their nature&#146;s integrity.&#160; And the sinful will though it violated the order of its own nature, did not on that account escape the laws of God, who justly orders all things for good.&#160; For as the beauty of a picture is increased by well-managed shadows, so, to the eye that has skill to discern it, the universe is beautified even by sinners, though, considered by themselves, their deformity is a sad blemish.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XI.23-p4"></A>In the second place, Origen, and all who think with him, ought to have seen that if it were the true opinion that the world was created in order that souls might, for their sins, be accommodated with bodies in which they should be shut up as in houses of correction, the more venial sinners receiving lighter and more ethereal bodies, while the grosser and graver sinners received bodies more crass and grovelling, then it would follow that the devils, who are deepest in wickedness, ought, rather than even wicked men, to have earthly bodies, since these are the grossest and least ethereal of all.&#160; But in point of fact, that we might see that the deserts of souls are not to be estimated by the qualities of bodies, the wickedest devil possesses an ethereal body, while man, wicked, it is true, but with a wickedness small and venial in comparison with his, received even before his sin a body of clay.&#160; And what more foolish assertion can be advanced than that God, by this sun of ours, did not design to benefit the material creation, or lend lustre to its loveliness, and therefore created one single sun for this single world, but that it so happened that one soul only had so sinned as to deserve to be enclosed in such a body as it is?&#160; On this principle, if it had chanced that not one, but two, yea, or ten, or a hundred had sinned similarly, and with a like degree of guilt, then this world would have one hundred suns.&#160; And that such is not the case, is due not to the considerate foresight of the Creator, contriving the safety and beauty of things material, but rather to the fact that so fine a quality of sinning was hit upon by only one soul, so that it alone has merited such a body.&#160; Manifestly persons holding such opinions should aim at confining, not souls of which they know not what they say, but themselves, lest they fall, and deservedly, far indeed from the truth.&#160; And as to these three answers which I formerly recommended when in the case of any creature the questions are put, Who made it? By what means? Why? that it should be replied, God, By the Word, Because it was good,&#8212;as to these three answers, it is very questionable whether the Trinity itself is thus mystically indicated, that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, or whether there is some good reason for this acceptation in this passage of Scripture,&#8212;this, I say, is questionable, and one can&#146;t be expected to explain everything in one volume.</p>
