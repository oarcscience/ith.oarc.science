<span id="iv.XX.3-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XX.3-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—What Solomon, in the Book of
Ecclesiastes, Says Regarding the Things Which Happen Alike to Good and
Wicked Men.</span>

<span id="iv.XX.3-p2"></span>Solomon, the wisest king of Israel, who
reigned in Jerusalem, thus commences the book called Ecclesiastes, which
the Jews number among their canonical Scriptures:  “Vanity of vanities,
said Ecclesiastes, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.  What profit hath
a man of all his labor which he hath taken under the sun?” <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316)   And after going on to enumerate,
with this as his text, the calamities and delusions of this life, and
the shifting nature of the present time, in which there is nothing
substantial, nothing lasting, he bewails, among the other vanities that
are under the sun, this <span id="page_423">p. 423</span> <span
id="iv.XX.3-Page_423"></span> also, that though wisdom excelleth folly
as light excelleth darkness, and though the eyes of the wise man are in
his head, while the fool walketh in darkness, <span
id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317) yet one event happeneth to them
all, that is to say, in this life under the sun, unquestionably alluding
to those evils which we see befall good and bad men alike.  He says,
further, that the good suffer the ills of life as if they were evil
doers, and the bad enjoy the good of life as if they were good.  “There
is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men unto
whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked:  again, there be
wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the
righteous.  I said, that this also is vanity.” <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318)   This wisest man devoted this
whole book to a full exposure of this vanity, evidently with no other
object than that we might long for that life in which there is no vanity
under the sun, but verity under Him who made the sun.  In this vanity,
then, was it not by the just and righteous judgment of God that man,
made like to vanity, was destined to pass away?  But in these days of
vanity it makes an important difference whether he resists or yields to
the truth, and whether he is destitute of true piety or a partaker of
it,—important not so far as regards the acquirement of the blessings or
the evasion of the calamities of this transitory and vain life, but in
connection with the future judgment which shall make over to good men
good things, and to bad men bad things, in permanent, inalienable
possession.  In fine, this wise man concludes this book of his by
saying, “Fear God, and keep His commandments:  for this is every man. 
For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every despised
person, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.” <span
id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319)   What truer, terser, more salutary
enouncement could be made?  “Fear God, he says, and keep His
commandments:  for this is every man.”  For whosoever has real
existence, is this, is a keeper of God’s commandments; and he who is not
this, is nothing.  For so long as he remains in the likeness of vanity,
he is not renewed in the image of the truth.  “For God shall bring into
judgment every work,”—that is, whatever man does in this life,—“whether
it be good or whether it be evil, with every despised person,”—that is,
with every man who here seems despicable, and is therefore not
considered; for God sees even him and does not despise him nor pass him
over in His judgment.
