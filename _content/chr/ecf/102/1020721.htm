<p class="c21"><a name="v.iv.xxv-p2"></A>26.&#160; Man, therefore, ought to be taught the due measure of loving, that is, in what measure he may love himself so as to be of service to himself.&#160; For that he does love himself, and does desire to do good to himself, nobody but a fool would doubt.&#160; He is to be taught, too, in what measure to love his body, so as to care for it wisely and within due limits.&#160; For it is equally manifest that he loves his body also, and desires to keep it safe and sound.&#160; And yet a man may have something that he loves better than the safety and soundness of his body.&#160; For many have been found voluntarily to suffer both pains and amputations of some of their limbs that they might obtain other objects which they valued more highly.&#160; But no one is to be told not to desire the safety and health of his body because there is something he desires more. &#160;For the miser, though he loves money, buys bread for himself,&#8212;that is, he gives away money that he is very fond of and desires to heap up,&#8212;but it is because he values more highly the bodily health which the bread sustains.&#160; It is superfluous to argue longer on a point so very plain, but this is just what the error of wicked men often compels us to do.</p>
