<span id="v.v.xli-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.v.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41.—What Kind of Spirit is Required for
the Study of Holy Scripture.</span>

<span id="v.v.xli-p2"></span>62.  But when the student of the Holy
Scriptures, prepared in the way I have indicated, shall enter upon his
investigations, let him constantly meditate upon that saying of the
apostle’s, “Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.” <span
id="fr_1824"></span>[1825](#fn_1824)   For so he will feel that,
whatever may be the riches he brings with him out of Egypt, yet unless
he has kept the passover, he cannot be safe.  Now Christ is our passover
sacrificed for us, <span id="fr_1825"></span>[1826](#fn_1825) and there
is nothing the sacrifice of Christ more clearly teaches us than the call
which He himself addresses to those whom He sees toiling in Egypt under
Pharaoh:  “Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I
will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am
meek and lowly in heart:  and ye shall find rest unto your souls.  For
my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” <span
id="fr_1826"></span>[1827](#fn_1826)   To whom is it light but to the
meek and lowly in heart, whom knowledge doth not puff up, but charity
edifieth?  Let them remember, then, that those who celebrated the
passover at that time in type and shadow, when they were ordered to mark
their door-posts with the blood of the lamb, used hyssop to mark them
with. <span id="fr_1827"></span>[1828](#fn_1827)   Now this is a meek
and lowly herb, and yet nothing is stronger and more penetrating than
its roots; that being rooted and grounded in love, we may be able to
comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth,
and height, <span id="fr_1828"></span>[1829](#fn_1828) —that is, to
comprehend the cross of our Lord, the breadth of which is indicated by
the transverse wood on which the hands are stretched, its length by the
part from the ground up to the cross-bar on which the whole body from
the head downwards is fixed, its height by the part from the crossbar to
the top on which the head lies, and its depth by the part which is
hidden, being fixed in the earth.  And by this sign of the cross all
Christian action is symbolized, viz., to do good works in Christ, to
cling with constancy to Him, to hope for heaven, and not to desecrate
the sacraments.  And purified by this Christian action, we shall be able
to know even “the love of Christ which passeth knowledge,” who is equal
to the Father, by whom all things, were made, “that we may be filled
with all the fullness of God.” <span
id="fr_1829"></span>[1830](#fn_1829)  There is besides in hyssop a
purgative virtue, that the breast may not be swollen with that knowledge
which puffeth up, nor boast vainly of the riches brought out from
Egypt.  “Purge me with hyssop,” the psalmist says, <span
id="fr_1830"></span>[1831](#fn_1830) “and I shall be clean; wash me, and
I shall be whiter than snow.  Make me to hear joy and gladness.”  Then
he immediately adds, to show that it is purifying from pride that is
indicated by hyssop, “that the bones which Thou hast broken <span
id="fr_1831"></span>[1832](#fn_1831) may rejoice.”
