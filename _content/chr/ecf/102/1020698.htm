<p class="c34"><a name="v.iv.ii-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="v.iv.ii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 2.&#8212;What a Thing Is, and What A Sign.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="v.iv.ii-p2"></A>2.&#160; All instruction is either about things or about signs; but things are learnt by means of signs.&#160; I now use the word &#8220;thing&#8221; in a strict sense, to signify that which is never employed as a sign of anything else:&#160; for example, wood, stone, cattle, and other things of that kind.&#160; Not, however, the wood which we read Moses cast into the bitter waters to make them sweet,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1718"></A><A HREF="#fn_1718"><FONT SIZE="1">1719</FONT></A>
 nor the stone which Jacob used as a pillow,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1719"></A><A HREF="#fn_1719"><FONT SIZE="1">1720</FONT></A>
 nor the ram which Abraham offered up instead of his son;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1720"></A><A HREF="#fn_1720"><FONT SIZE="1">1721</FONT></A>
 for these, though they are things, are also signs of other things.&#160; There are signs of another kind, those which are never employed except as signs:&#160; for example, words.&#160; No one uses words except as signs of something else; and hence may be understood what I call signs:&#160; those things, to wit, which are used to indicate something else.&#160; Accordingly, every sign is also a thing; for what is not a thing is nothing at all.&#160; Every thing, however, is not also a sign.&#160; And so, in regard to this distinction between things and signs, I shall, when I speak of things, speak in such a way that even if some of them may be used as signs also, that will not interfere with the division of the subject according to which I am to discuss things first and signs afterwards.&#160; But we must carefully remember that what we have now to consider about things is what they are in themselves, not what other things they are signs of.</p>
