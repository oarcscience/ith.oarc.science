<span id="iv.XII.11-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XII.11-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Of Those Who Suppose that This
World Indeed is Not Eternal, But that Either There are Numberless
Worlds, or that One and the Same World is Perpetually Resolved into Its
Elements, and Renewed at the Conclusion of Fixed Cycles.</span>

<span id="iv.XII.11-p2"></span>There are some, again, who, though they
do not suppose that this world is eternal, are of opinion either that
this is not the only world, but that there are numberless worlds or that
indeed it is the only one, but that it dies, and is born again at fixed
intervals, and this times without number; <span
id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540) but they must acknowledge that the
human race existed before there were other men to beget them.  For they
cannot suppose that, if the whole world perish, some men would be left
alive in the world, as they might survive in floods and conflagrations,
which those other speculators suppose to be partial, and from which they
can therefore reasonably argue that a few then survived whose posterity
would renew the population; but as they believe that the world itself is
renewed out of its own material, so they must believe that out of its
elements the human race was produced, and then that the progeny of
mortals sprang like that of other animals from their parents.

<span id="iv.XII.11-p3"></span> The former opinion was held by
Democritus and his disciple Epicurus; the latter by Heraclitus, who
supposed that “God amused Himself” by thus renewing worlds.
