<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XXII.19-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XXII.19-p1.1"></A>Chapter 19.&#8212;That All Bodily Blemishes Which Mar Human Beauty in This Life Shall Be Removed in the Resurrection, the Natural Substance of the Body Remaining, But the Quality and Quantity of It Being Altered So as to Produce Beauty.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XXII.19-p2"></A>What am I to say now about the hair and nails?&#160; Once it is understood that no part of the body shall so perish as to produce deformity in the body, it is at the same time understood that such things as would have produced a deformity by their excessive proportions shall be added to the total bulk of the body, not to parts in which the beauty of the proportion would thus be marred.&#160; Just as if, after making a vessel of clay, one wished to make it over again of the same clay, it would not be necessary that the same portion of the clay which had formed the handle should again form the new handle, or that what had formed the bottom should again do so, but only that the whole clay should go to make up the whole new vessel, and that no part of it should be left unused.&#160; Wherefore, if the hair that has been cropped and the nails that have been cut would cause a deformity were they to be restored to their places, they shall not be restored; and yet no one will lose these parts at the resurrection, for they shall be changed into the same flesh, their substance being so altered as to preserve the proportion of the various parts of the body.&#160; However, what our Lord said, &#8220;Not a hair of your head shall perish,&#8221; might more suitably be interpreted of the number, and not of the length of the hairs, as He elsewhere says, &#8220;The hairs of your head are all numbered.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1646"></A><A HREF="#fn_1646"><FONT SIZE="1">1647</FONT></A>
&#160; Nor would I say this because I suppose that any part naturally belonging to the body can perish, but that whatever deformity was in it, and served to exhibit the penal condition in which we mortals are, should be restored in such a way that, while the substance is entirely preserved, the deformity shall perish.&#160; For if even a human workman, who has, for some reason, made a deformed statue, can recast it and make it very beautiful, and this without suffering any part of the substance, but only the deformity to be lost,&#8212;if he can, for example, remove some unbecoming or disproportionate part, not by cutting off and separating this part from the whole, but by so breaking down and mixing up the whole as to get rid of the blemish without diminishing the quantity of his material,&#8212;shall we not think as highly of the almighty Worker?&#160; Shall He not be able to remove and abolish all deformities of the human body, whether common ones or rare and monstrous, which, though in keeping with this miserable life, are yet not to be thought of in connection with that future blessedness; and shall He not be able so to remove them that, while the natural but unseemly blemishes are put an end to, the natural substance shall suffer no diminution?</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XXII.19-p4"></A>And consequently overgrown and emaciated persons need not fear that they shall be in heaven of such a figure as they would not be even in this world if they could help it.&#160; For all bodily beauty consists in the proportion of the parts, together with a certain agreeableness of color.&#160; Where there is no proportion, the eye is offended, either because there is something awanting, or too small, or too large.&#160; And thus there shall be no deformity resulting from want of proportion in that state in which all that is wrong is corrected, and all that is defective supplied from resources the Creator wots of, and all that is excessive removed without destroying the integrity of the substance.&#160; And as for the pleasant color, how conspicuous shall it be where &#8220;the just shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father!&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1647"></A><A HREF="#fn_1647"><FONT SIZE="1">1648</FONT></A>
&#160; This brightness we must rather  <A NAME="page_498"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 498</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XXII.19-Page_498"></A>  believe to have been concealed from the eyes of the disciples when Christ rose, than to have been awanting.&#160; For weak human eyesight could not bear it, and it was necessary that they should so look upon Him as to be able to recognize Him.&#160; For this purpose also He allowed them to touch the marks of His wounds, and also ate and drank,&#8212;not because He needed nourishment, but because He could take it if He wished.&#160; Now, when an object, though present, is invisible to persons who see other things which are present, as we say that that brightness was present but invisible by those who saw other things, this is called in Greek <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.XXII.19-p5.2"></A> &#7936;&#959;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#8055;&#945;</span>; and our Latin translators, for want of a better word, have rendered this <i> c&aelig;citas</i> (blindness) in the book of Genesis.&#160; This blindness the men of Sodom suffered when they sought the just Lot&#146;s gate and could not find it.&#160; But if it had been blindness, that is to say, if they could see nothing, then they would not have asked for the gate by which they might enter the house, but for guides who might lead them away.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XXII.19-p6"></A>But the love we bear to the blessed martyrs causes us, I know not how, to desire to see in the heavenly kingdom the marks of the wounds which they received for the name of Christ, and possibly we shall see them.&#160; For this will not be a deformity, but a mark of honor, and will add lustre to their appearance, and a spiritual, if not a bodily beauty.&#160; And yet we need not believe that they to whom it has been said, &#8220;Not a hair of your head shall perish,&#8221; shall, in the resurrection, want such of their members as they have been deprived of in their martyrdom.&#160; But if it will be seemly in that new kingdom to have some marks of these wounds still visible in that immortal flesh, the places where they have been wounded or mutilated shall retain the scars without any of the members being lost.&#160; While, therefore, it is quite true that no blemishes which the body has sustained shall appear in the resurrection, yet we are not to reckon or name these marks of virtue blemishes.</p>
