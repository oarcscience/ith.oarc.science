id="iv.XVI.33-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—Of Rebecca, the Grand-Daughter of
Nahor, Whom Isaac Took to Wife.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.33-p2"></span>Isaac married Rebecca, the grand-daughter
of Nahor, his father’s brother, when he was forty years old, that is, in
the 140th year of his father’s life, three years after his mother’s
death.  Now when a servant was sent to Mesopotamia by his father to
fetch her, and when Abraham said to that servant, “Put thy hand under my
thigh, and I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and
the Lord of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son Isaac
of the daughters of the Canaanites,” <span
id="fr_947"></span>[948](#fn_947) what else was pointed out by this, but
that the Lord, the God of heaven, and the Lord of the earth, was to come
in the flesh which was to be derived from that thigh?  Are these small
tokens of the foretold truth which we see fulfilled in Christ?
