<span id="iv.XVII.17-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVII.17-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—Of Those Things in the 110th
Psalm Which Relate to the Priesthood of Christ, and in the 22d to His
Passion.</span>

<span id="iv.XVII.17-p2"></span>Just as in that psalm also where Christ
is most openly proclaimed as Priest, even as He is here as King, “The
Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine
enemies Thy footstool.” <span id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090)  
That Christ sits on the right hand of God the Father is believed, not
seen; that His enemies also are put under His feet doth not yet appear;
it is being done, \[therefore\] it will appear at last:  yea, this is
now believed, afterward it shall be seen.  But what follows, “The Lord
will send forth the rod of Thy strength out of Sion, and rule Thou in
the midst of Thine enemies,” <span id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091)
is so clear, that to deny it would imply not merely unbelief and
mistake, but downright impudence.  And even enemies must certainly
confess that out of Sion has been sent the law of Christ which we call
the gospel, and acknowledge as the rod of His strength.  But that He
rules in the midst of His enemies, these same enemies among whom He
rules themselves bear witness, gnashing their teeth and consuming away,
and having power to do nothing against Him.  Then what he says a little
after, “The Lord hath sworn and will not repent,” <span
id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092) by which words He intimates that
what He adds is immutable, “Thou art a priest for ever after the order
of Melchizedek,” <span id="fr_1093"></span>[1094](#fn_1093) who is
permitted to doubt of whom these things are said, seeing that now there
is nowhere a priesthood and sacrifice after the order of Aaron, and
everywhere men offer under Christ as the Priest, which Melchizedek
showed when he blessed Abraham?  Therefore to these manifest things are
to be referred, when rightly understood, those things in the same psalm
that are set down a little more obscurely, and we have already made
known in our popular sermons how these things are to be rightly
understood.  So also in that where Christ utters through prophecy the
humiliation of His passion, saying, “They pierced my hands and feet;
they counted all my bones.  Yea, they looked and stared at me.” <span
id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094)   By which words he certainly meant
His body stretched out on the cross, with the hands and feet pierced and
perforated by the striking through of the nails, and that He had in that
way made Himself a spectacle to those who looked and stared.  And he
adds, “They parted my garments among them, and over my vesture they cast
lots.” <span id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095)   How this prophecy
has been fulfilled the Gospel history narrates.  Then, indeed, the other
things also which are said there less openly are rightly understood when
they agree with those which shine with so great clearness; especially
because those things also which we do not believe as past, but survey as
present, are beheld by the whole world, being now exhibited just as they
are read of in this very psalm as predicted so long before.  For it is
there said a little after, “All the ends of the earth shall remember,
and turn unto the Lord, and all the kindreds of the nations shall
worship before Him; for the kingdom is the Lord’s, and He shall rule the
nations.”
