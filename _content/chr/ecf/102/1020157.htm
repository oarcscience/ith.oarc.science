<p class="c21"><a name="iv.V.16-p2"></A>But the reward of the saints is far different, who even here endured reproaches for that  <A NAME="page_98"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 98</FONT></A> <a name="iv.V.16-Page_98"></A>  city of God which is hateful to the lovers of this world.&#160; That city is eternal.&#160; There none are born, for none die.&#160; There is true and full felicity,&#8212;not a goddess, but a gift of God.&#160; Thence we receive the pledge of faith whilst on our pilgrimage we sigh for its beauty.&#160; There rises not the sun on the good and the evil, but the Sun of Righteousness protects the good alone.&#160; There no great industry shall be expended to enrich the public treasury by suffering privations at home, for there is the common treasury of truth.&#160; And, therefore, it was not only for the sake of recompensing the citizens of Rome that her empire and glory had been so signally extended, but also that the citizens of that eternal city, during their pilgrimage here, might diligently and soberly contemplate these examples, and see what a love they owe to the supernal country on account of life eternal, if the terrestrial country was so much beloved by its citizens on account of human glory.</p>
