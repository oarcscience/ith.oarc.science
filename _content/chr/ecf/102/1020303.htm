<p class="c34"><a name="iv.X.32-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.X.32-p1.1"></A>Chapter 32.&#8212;Of the Universal Way of the Soul&#146;s Deliverance, Which Porphyry Did Not Find Because He Did Not Rightly Seek It, and Which the Grace of Christ Has Alone Thrown Open.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.X.32-p2"></A>This is the religion which possesses the universal way for delivering the soul; for except by this way, none can be delivered.&#160; This is a kind of royal way, which alone leads to a kingdom which does not totter like all temporal dignities, but stands firm on eternal foundations.&#160; And when Porphyry says, towards the end of the first book <i>De Regressu Anim&#339;</i>, that no system of doctrine which furnishes the universal way for delivering the soul has as yet been received, either from the truest philosophy, or from the ideas and practices of the Indians, or from the reasoning&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_436"></A><A HREF="#fn_436"><FONT SIZE="1">437</FONT></A>
 of the Chald&aelig;ans, or from any source whatever, and that no historical reading had made him acquainted with that way, he manifestly acknowledges that there is such a way, but that as yet he was not acquainted with it.&#160; Nothing of all that he had so laboriously learned concerning the deliverance of the soul, nothing of all that he seemed to others, if not to himself, to know and believe, satisfied him.&#160; For he perceived that there was still wanting a commanding authority which it might be right to follow in a matter of such importance.&#160; And when he says that he had not learned from any truest philosophy a system which possessed the universal way of the soul&#146;s deliverance, he shows plainly enough, as it seems to me, either that the philosophy of which he was a disciple was not the truest, or that it did not comprehend such a way.&#160; And how can that be the truest philosophy which does not possess this way?&#160; For what else is the universal way of the soul&#146;s deliverance than that by which all souls universally are delivered, and without which, therefore, no soul is delivered?&#160; And when he says, in addition, &#8220;or from the ideas and practices of the Indians, or from the reasoning of the Chald&aelig;ans, or from any source whatever,&#8221; he declares in the most unequivocal language that this universal way of the soul&#146;s deliverance was not embraced in what he had learned either from the Indians or the Chald&aelig;ans; and yet he could not forbear stating that it was from the Chald&aelig;ans he had derived these divine oracles of which he makes such frequent mention.&#160; What, therefore, does he mean by this universal way of the soul&#146;s deliverance, which had not yet been made known by any truest philosophy, or by the doctrinal systems of those nations which were considered to have great insight in things divine, because they indulged more freely in a curious and fanciful science and worship of angels?&#160; What is this universal way of which he acknowledges his ignorance, if not a way which does not belong to one nation as its special property, but is common to all, and divinely bestowed?&#160; Porphyry, a man of no mediocre abilities, does not question that such a way exists; for he believes that Divine Providence could not have left men destitute of this universal way of delivering the soul.&#160; For he does not say that this way does not exist, but that this great boon and assistance has not yet been discovered, and has not come to his knowledge.&#160; And no wonder; for Porphyry lived in an age when this universal way of the soul&#146;s deliverance,&#8212;in other words, the Christian religion,&#8212;was exposed to the persecutions of idolaters and demon-worshippers, and earthly rulers,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_437"></A><A HREF="#fn_437"><FONT SIZE="1">438</FONT></A>
 that the number of martyrs or witnesses for the truth might be completed and consecrated, and that by them proof might be given that we must endure all bodily sufferings in the cause of the holy faith, and for the commendation of the truth.&#160; Porphyry, being a witness of these persecutions, concluded that this way was destined to a speedy extinction, and that it, therefore, was not the universal way of the soul&#146;s deliverance, and did not see that the very thing that thus moved him, and deterred him from becoming a Christian, contributed to the confirmation and more effectual commendation of our religion.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.X.32-p5"></A>This, then, is the universal way of the soul&#146;s deliverance, the way that is granted by the divine compassion to the nations universally.&#160; And no nation to which the knowledge of it has already come, or may hereafter come, ought to demand, Why so soon? or, Why so late?&#8212;for the design of Him who sends it is impenetrable by human capacity.&#160; This was felt by Porphyry when he confined himself to saying that this gift of God was not yet received, and had not yet come to his knowledge.&#160; For though this was so, he did not on that account pronounce that the way it  <A NAME="page_203"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 203</FONT></A> <a name="iv.X.32-Page_203"></A>  self had no existence.&#160; This, I say, is the universal way for the deliverance of believers, concerning which the faithful Abraham received the divine assurance, &#8220;In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_438"></A><A HREF="#fn_438"><FONT SIZE="1">439</FONT></A>
&#160; He, indeed, was by birth a Chald&aelig;an; but, that he might receive these great promises, and that there might be propagated from him a seed &#8220;disposed by angels in the hand of a Mediator,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_439"></A><A HREF="#fn_439"><FONT SIZE="1">440</FONT></A>
 in whom this universal way, thrown open to all nations for the deliverance of the soul, might be found, he was ordered to leave his country, and kindred, and father&#146;s house.&#160; Then was he himself, first of all, delivered from the Chald&aelig;an superstitions, and by his obedience worshipped the one true God, whose promises he faithfully trusted.&#160; This is the universal way, of which it is said in holy prophecy, &#8220;God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause His face to shine upon us; that Thy way may be known upon earth, Thy saving health among all nations.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_440"></A><A HREF="#fn_440"><FONT SIZE="1">441</FONT></A>
&#160; And hence, when our Saviour, so long after, had taken flesh of the seed of Abraham, He says of Himself, &#8220;I am the way, the truth, and the life.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_441"></A><A HREF="#fn_441"><FONT SIZE="1">442</FONT></A>
&#160; This is the universal way, of which so long before it had been predicted, &#8220;And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord&#146;s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.&#160; And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths:&#160; for out of Sion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_442"></A><A HREF="#fn_442"><FONT SIZE="1">443</FONT></A>
&#160; This way, therefore, is not the property of one, but of all nations.&#160; The law and the word of the Lord did not remain in Zion and Jerusalem, but issued thence to be universally diffused.&#160; And therefore the Mediator Himself, after His resurrection, says to His alarmed disciples, &#8220;These are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me.&#160; Then opened He their understandings that they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:&#160; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_443"></A><A HREF="#fn_443"><FONT SIZE="1">444</FONT></A>
&#160; This is the universal way of the soul&#146;s deliverance, which the holy angels and the holy prophets formerly disclosed where they could among the few men who found the grace of God, and especially in the Hebrew nation, whose commonwealth was, as it were, consecrated to prefigure and fore-announce the city of God which was to be gathered from all nations, by their tabernacle, and temple, and priesthood, and sacrifices.&#160; In some explicit statements, and in many obscure foreshadowings, this way was declared; but latterly came the Mediator Himself in the flesh, and His blessed apostles, revealing how the grace of the New Testament more openly explained what had been obscurely hinted to preceding generations, in conformity with the relation of the ages of the human race, and as it pleased God in His wisdom to appoint, who also bore them witness with signs and miracles some of which I have cited above.&#160; For not only were there visions of angels, and words heard from those heavenly ministrants, but also men of God, armed with the word of simple piety, cast out unclean spirits from the bodies and senses of men, and healed deformities and sicknesses; the wild beasts of earth and sea, the birds of air, inanimate things, the elements, the stars, obeyed their divine commands; the powers of hell gave way before them, the dead were restored to life.&#160; I say nothing of the miracles peculiar and proper to the Saviour&#146;s own person, especially the nativity and the resurrection; in the one of which He wrought only the mystery of a virgin maternity, while in the other He furnished an instance of the resurrection which all shall at last experience.&#160; This way purifies the whole man, and prepares the mortal in all his parts for immortality.&#160; For, to prevent us from seeking for one purgation for the part which Porphyry calls intellectual, and another for the part he calls spiritual, and another for the body itself, our most mighty and truthful Purifier and Saviour assumed the whole human nature.&#160; Except by this way, which has been present among men both during the period of the promises and of the proclamation of their fulfillment, no man has been delivered, no man is delivered, no man shall be delivered.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.X.32-p12"></A>As to Porphyry&#146;s statement that the universal way of the soul&#146;s deliverance had not yet come to his knowledge by any acquaintance he had with history, I would ask, what more remarkable history can be found than that which has taken possession of the whole world by its authoritative voice? or what more trustworthy than that which narrates past events, and predicts the future with  <A NAME="page_204"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 204</FONT></A> <a name="iv.X.32-Page_204"></A>  equal clearness, and in the unfulfilled predictions of which we are constrained to believe by those that are already fulfilled?&#160; For neither Porphyry nor any Platonists can despise divination and prediction, even of things that pertain to this life and earthly matters, though they justly despise ordinary soothsaying and the divination that is connected with magical arts.&#160; They deny that these are the predictions of great men, or are to be considered important, and they are right; for they are founded, either on the foresight of subsidiary causes, as to a professional eye much of the course of a disease is foreseen by certain pre-monitory symptoms, or the unclean demons predict what they have resolved to do, that they may thus work upon the thoughts and desires of the wicked with an appearance of authority, and incline human frailty to imitate their impure actions.&#160; It is not such things that the saints who walk in the universal way care to predict as important, although, for the purpose of commending the faith, they knew and often predicted even such things as could not be detected by human observation, nor be readily verified by experience.&#160; But there were other truly important and divine events which they predicted, in so far as it was given them to know the will of God.&#160; For the incarnation of Christ, and all those important marvels that were accomplished in Him, and done in His name; the repentance of men and the conversion of their wills to God; the remission of sins, the grace of righteousness, the faith of the pious, and the multitudes in all parts of the world who believe in the true divinity; the overthrow of idolatry and demon worship, and the testing of the faithful by trials; the purification of those who persevered, and their deliverance from all evil; the day of judgment, the resurrection of the dead, the eternal damnation of the community of the ungodly, and the eternal kingdom of the most glorious city of God, ever-blessed in the enjoyment of the vision of God,&#8212;these things were predicted and promised in the Scriptures of this way; and of these we see so many fulfilled, that we justly and piously trust that the rest will also come to pass.&#160; As for those who do not believe, and consequently do not understand, that this is the way which leads straight to the vision of God and to eternal fellowship with Him, according to the true predictions and statements of the Holy Scriptures, they may storm at our position, but they cannot storm it.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.X.32-p13"></A>And therefore, in these ten books, though not meeting, I dare say, the expectation of some, yet I have, as the true God and Lord has vouchsafed to aid me, satisfied the desire of certain persons, by refuting the objections of the ungodly, who prefer their own gods to the Founder of the holy city, about which we undertook to speak.&#160; Of these ten books, the first five were directed against those who think we should worship the gods for the sake of the blessings of this life, and the second five against those who think we should worship them for the sake of the life which is to be after death.&#160; And now, in fulfillment of the promise I made in the first book, I shall go on to say, as God shall aid me, what I think needs to be said regarding the origin, history, and deserved ends of the two cities, which, as already remarked, are in this world commingled and implicated with one another.</p>
