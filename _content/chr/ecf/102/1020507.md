<span id="iv.XVII.14-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVII.14-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Of David’s Concern in the
Writing of the Psalms.</span>

<span id="iv.XVII.14-p2"></span>In the progress of the city of God
through the ages, therefore, David first reigned in the earthly
Jerusalem as a shadow of that which was to come.  Now David was a man
skilled in songs, who dearly loved musical harmony, not with a vulgar
delight, but with a believing disposition, and by it served his God, who
is the true God, by the mystical representation of a great thing.  For
the rational and well-ordered concord of diverse sounds in harmonious
variety suggests the compact unity of the well-ordered city.  Then
almost all his prophecy is in psalms, of which a hundred and fifty are
contained in what we call the Book of Psalms, of which some will have it
those only were made by David which are in <span id="page_353">p.
353</span> <span id="iv.XVII.14-Page_353"></span> scribed with his
name.  But there are also some who think none of them were made by him
except those which are marked “Of David;” but those which have in the
title “For David” have been made by others who assumed his person. 
Which opinion is refuted by the voice of the Saviour Himself in the
Gospel, when He says that David himself by the Spirit said Christ was
his Lord; for the 110th Psalm begins thus, “The Lord said unto my Lord,
Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy
footstool.” <span id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080)   And truly that
very psalm, like many more, has in the title, not “of David,” but “for
David.”  But those seem to me to hold the more credible opinion, who
ascribe to him the authorship of all these hundred and fifty psalms, and
think that he prefixed to some of them the names even of other men, who
prefigured something pertinent to the matter, but chose to have no man’s
name in the titles of the rest, just as God inspired him in the
management of this variety, which, although dark, is not meaningless. 
Neither ought it to move one not to believe this that the names of some
prophets who lived long after the times of king David are read in the
inscriptions of certain psalms in that book, and that the things said
there seem to be spoken as it were by them.  Nor was the prophetic
Spirit unable to reveal to king David, when he prophesied, even these
names of future prophets, so that he might prophetically sing something
which should suit their persons; just as it was revealed to a certain
prophet that king Josiah should arise and reign after more than three
hundred years, who predicted his future deeds also along with his
name. <span id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081)
