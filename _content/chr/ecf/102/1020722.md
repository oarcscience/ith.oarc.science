<span id="v.iv.xxvi-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.iv.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—The Command to Love God and Our
Neighbor Includes a Command to Love Ourselves.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xxvi-p2"></span>27.  Seeing, then, that there is no need
of a command that every man should love himself and his own
body,—seeing, that is, that we love ourselves, and what is beneath us
but connected with us, through a law of nature which has never been
violated, and which is common to us with the beasts (for even the beasts
love themselves and their own bodies),—it only remained necessary to lay
injunctions upon us in regard to God above us, and our neighbor beside
us.  “Thou shalt love,” He says, “the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind; and thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself.  On these two commandments hang all the law and the
prophets.” <span id="fr_1737"></span>[1738](#fn_1737)   Thus the end of
the commandment is love, and that twofold, the love of God and the love
of our neighbor.  Now, if you take yourself in your entirety,—that is,
soul and body together,—and your neighbor in his entirety, soul and body
together (for man is made up of soul and body), you will find that none
of the classes of things that are to be loved is overlooked in these two
commandments.  For though, when the love of God comes first, and the
measure of our love for Him is prescribed in such terms that it is
evident all other things are to find their centre in Him, nothing seems
to be said about our love for ourselves; yet when it is said, “Thou
shall love thy neighbor as thyself,” it at once becomes evident that our
love for ourselves has not been overlooked.
