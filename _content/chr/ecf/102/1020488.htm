<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVI.39-p2"></A>As I said a little ago, Jacob was also called Israel, the name which was most prevalent among the people descended from him.&#160; Now this name was given him by the angel who wrestled with him on the way back from Mesopotamia, and who was most evidently a type of Christ.&#160; For when Jacob overcame him, doubtless with his own consent, that the mystery might be represented, it signified Christ&#146;s passion, in which the Jews are seen overcoming Him.&#160; And yet he besought a blessing from the very angel he had overcome; and so the imposition of this name was the blessing.&#160; For Israel means <i>seeing God</i>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_964"></A><A HREF="#fn_964"><FONT SIZE="1">965</FONT></A>
 which will at last be the reward of all the saints.&#160; The angel also touched him on the breadth of the thigh when he was overcoming him, and in that way made him lame.&#160; So that Jacob was at one and the same time blessed and lame:&#160; blessed in those among that people who believed in Christ, and lame in the unbelieving.&#160; For the breadth of the thigh is the multitude of the family.&#160; For there are many of that race of whom it was prophetically said beforehand, &#8220;And they have halted in their paths.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_965"></A><A HREF="#fn_965"><FONT SIZE="1">966</FONT></A>
