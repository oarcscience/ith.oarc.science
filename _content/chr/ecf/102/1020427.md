<span id="iv.XV.6-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XV.6-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Of the Weaknesses Which Even the
Citizens of the City of God Suffer During This Earthly Pilgrimage in
Punishment of Sin, and of Which They are Healed by God’s Care.</span>

<span id="iv.XV.6-p2"></span>This sickliness—that is to say, that
disobedience of which we spoke in the fourteenth book—is the punishment
of the first disobedience.  It is therefore not nature, but vice; and
therefore it is said to the good who are growing in grace, and living in
this pilgrimage by faith, “Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfill
the law of Christ.” <span id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775)   In like
manner it is said elsewhere, “Warn them that are unruly, comfort the
feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.  See that
none render evil for evil unto any man.” <span
id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776)   And in another place, “If a man be
overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the
spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be
tempted.” <span id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777)   And elsewhere, “Let
not the sun go down upon your wrath.” <span
id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778)   And in the Gospel, “If thy brother
shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and
him alone.” <span id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779)   So too of sins
which may create scandal the apostle says, “Them that sin rebuke before
all, that others also may fear.” <span id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780)
  For this purpose, and that we may keep that peace without which no man
can see the Lord, <span id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781) many precepts
are given which carefully inculcate mutual forgiveness; among which we
may number that terrible word in which the servant is ordered to pay his
formerly remitted debt of ten thousand talents, because he did not remit
to his fellow-servant his debt of two hundred pence.  To which parable
the Lord Jesus added the words, “So likewise shall my heavenly Father do
also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his
brother.” <span id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782)   It is thus the
citizens of the city of God are healed while still they sojourn in this
earth and sigh for the peace of their heavenly country.  The Holy
Spirit, too, works within, that the medicine externally applied may have
some good result.  Otherwise, even though God Himself make use of the
creatures that are subject to Him, and in some human form address our
human senses, whether we receive those impressions in sleep or in some
external appearance, still, if He does not by His own inward grace sway
and act upon the mind, no preaching of the truth is of any avail.  But
this God does, distinguishing between the vessels of wrath and the
vessels of mercy, by His own very secret but very just providence.  When
He Himself aids the soul in His own hidden and wonderful ways, and the
sin which dwells in our members, and is, as the apostle teaches, rather
the punishment of sin, does not reign in our mortal body to obey the
lusts of it, and when we no longer yield our members as instruments of
unrighteousness, <span id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783) then the soul
is converted from its own evil and selfish desires, and, God possessing
it, it possesses itself in peace even in this life, and afterwards, with
perfected health and endowed with im <span id="page_288">p. 288</span>
<span id="iv.XV.6-Page_288"></span> mortality, will reign without sin in
peace everlasting.
