therefore, in regard to any expression that we are trying to understand
is, whether it is literal or figurative.  For when it is ascertained to
be figurative, it is easy, by an application of the laws of things which
we discussed in the first book, to turn it in every way until we arrive
at a true interpretation, especially when we bring to our aid experience
strengthened by the exercise of piety.  Now we find out whether an
expression is literal or figurative by attending to the considerations
indicated above.
