<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVIII.19-p2"></A>After the capture and destruction of Troy, &AElig;neas, with twenty ships laden with the Trojan relics, came into Italy, when Latinus reigned there, Menestheus in Athens, Polyphidos in Sicyon, and Tautanos in Assyria, and Abdon was judge of the Hebrews.&#160; On the death of Latinus, &AElig;neas reigned three years, the same kings continuing in the above-named places, except that Pelasgus was now king in Sicyon, and Samson was judge of the Hebrews, who is thought to be Hercules, because of his wonderful strength.&#160; Now the Latins made &AElig;neas one of their gods, because at his death he was nowhere to be found.&#160; The Sabines also placed among the gods their first king, Sancus, [Sangus], or Sanctus, as some call him.&#160; At that time Codrus king of Athens exposed himself <i>incognito</i> to be slain by the Peloponnesian foes of that city, and so was slain.&#160; In this way, they say, he delivered his country.&#160; For the Peloponnesians had received a response from the oracle, that they should overcome the Athenians only on condition that they did not slay their king.&#160; Therefore he deceived them by appearing in a poor man&#146;s dress, and provoking them, by quarrelling, to murder him.&#160; Whence Virgil says, &#8220;Or the quarrels of Codrus.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1142"></A><A HREF="#fn_1142"><FONT SIZE="1">1143</FONT></A>
&#160; And the Athenians worshipped this man as a god with sacrificial honors.&#160; The fourth king of the Latins was Silvius the son of &AElig;neas, not by Cre&uuml;sa, of whom Ascanius the third king was born, but by Lavinia the daughter of Latinus, and he is said to have been his posthumous child.&#160; Oneus was the twenty-ninth king of Assyria, Melanthus the sixteenth of the Athenians, and Eli the priest was judge of the Hebrews; and the kingdom of Sicyon then came to an end, after lasting, it is said, for nine hundred and fifty-nine years.</p>
