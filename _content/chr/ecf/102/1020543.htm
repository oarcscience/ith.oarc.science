<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVIII.25-p2"></A>When Zedekiah reigned over the Hebrews, and Tarquinius Priscus, the successor of Ancus Martius, over the Romans, the Jewish people was led captive into Babylon, Jerusalem and the temple built by Solomon being overthrown.&#160; For the prophets, in chiding them for their iniquity and impiety, predicted that these things should come to pass, especially Jeremiah, who even stated the number of years.&#160; Pittacus of Mitylene, another of the sages, is reported to have lived at that time.&#160; And Eusebius writes that, while the people of God were held captive in Babylon, the five other sages lived, who must be added to Thales, whom we mentioned above, and Pittacus, in order to make up the seven.&#160; These are Solon of Athens, Chilo of Laced&aelig;mon, Periander of Corinth, Cleobulus of Lindus, and Bias of Priene.&#160; These flourished after the theological poets, and were called sages, because they excelled other men in a certain laudable line of life, and summed up some moral precepts in epigrammatic sayings.&#160; But they left posterity no literary monuments, except that Solon is alleged to have given certain laws to the Athenians, and Thales was a natural philosopher, and left books of his doctrine in short proverbs.&#160; In that time of the Jewish captivity, Anaximander, Anaximenes, and Xenophanes, the natural philosophers, flourished.&#160; Pythagoras also lived then, and at this time the name philosopher was first used.</p>
