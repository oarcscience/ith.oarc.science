<p class="c21"><a name="iv.VII.29-p2"></A>For all those things which, according to the account given of those gods, are referred to the world by so-called physical interpretation, may, without any religious scruple, be rather assigned to the true God, who made heaven and earth, and created every soul and every body; and the following is the manner in which we see that this may be done.&#160; We worship God,&#8212;not heaven and earth, of which two parts this world consists, nor the soul or souls diffused through all living things,&#8212;but God who made heaven and earth, and all things which are in them; who made every soul, whatever be the nature of its life, whether it have life without sensation and reason, or life with sensation, or life with both sensation and reason.</p>
