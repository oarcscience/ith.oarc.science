<p class="c34"><a name="iv.VII.6-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.VII.6-p1.1"></A>Chapter 6.&#8212;Concerning the Opinion of Varro, that God is the Soul of the World, Which Nevertheless, in Its Various Parts, Has Many Souls Whose Nature is Divine.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.VII.6-p2"></A>The same Varro, then, still speaking by anticipation, says that he thinks that God is the soul of the world (which the Greeks call  <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.VII.6-p2.1"></A>&#954;&#8057;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span>), and that this world itself is God; but as a wise man, though he consists of body and mind, is nevertheless called wise on account of his mind, so the world is called God on account of mind, although it consists of mind and body. Here he seems, in some fashion at least, to acknowledge one God; but that he may introduce more, he adds that the world is divided into two parts, heaven and earth, which are again divided each into two parts, heaven into ether and air, earth into water and land, of all which the ether is the highest, the air second, the water third, and the earth the lowest.&#160; All these four parts, he says, are full of souls; those which are in the ether and air being immortal, and those which are in the water and on the earth mortal.&#160; From the highest part of the heavens to the orbit of the moon there are souls, namely, the stars and planets; and these are not only understood to be gods, but are seen to be such.&#160; And between the orbit of the moon and the commencement of the region of clouds and winds there are aerial souls; but these are seen with the mind, not with the eyes, and are called Heroes, and Lares, and Genii.&#160; This is the natural theology which is briefly set forth in these anticipatory statements, and which satisfied not Varro only, but many philosophers besides.&#160; This I must discuss more carefully, when, with the help of God, I shall have completed what I have yet to say concerning the civil theology, as far as it concerns the select gods.</p>
