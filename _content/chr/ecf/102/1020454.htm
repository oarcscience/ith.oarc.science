<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVI.5-p2"></A>We read, &#8220;The Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men built:&#8221;&#160; it was not the sons of God, but that society which lived in a merely human way, and which we call the earthly city.&#160; God, who is always wholly everywhere, does not move locally; but He is said to descend when He does anything in the earth out of the usual course, which, as it were, makes His presence felt.&#160; And in the same way, He does not by &#8220;seeing&#8221; learn some new thing, for He cannot ever be ignorant of anything; but He is said to see and recognize, in time, that which He causes others to see and recognize.&#160; And therefore that city was not previously being seen as God made it be seen when He showed how offensive it was to Him.&#160; We might, indeed, interpret God&#146;s descending to the city of the descent of His angels in whom He dwells; so that the following words, &#8220;And the Lord God said, Behold, they are all one race and of one language,&#8221; and also what follows, &#8220;Come, and let us go down and confound their speech,&#8221; are a recapitulation, explaining how the previously intimated &#8220;descent of the Lord&#8221; was accomplished.&#160; For if He had already gone down, why does He say, &#8220;Come, and let us go down and confound?&#8221;&#8212;words which seem to be addressed to the angels, and to intimate that He who was in the angels descended in their descent.&#160; And the words most appropriately are, not, &#8220;Go ye down and confound,&#8221; but, &#8220;Let us confound their speech;&#8221; showing that He so works by His servants, that they are themselves also fellow-laborers with God, as the apostle says, &#8220;For we are fellow-laborers with God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_876"></A><A HREF="#fn_876"><FONT SIZE="1">877</FONT></A>
