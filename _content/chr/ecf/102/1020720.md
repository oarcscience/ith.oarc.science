<span id="v.iv.xxiv-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.iv.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—No Man Hates His Own Flesh, Not
Even Those Who Abuse It.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xxiv-p2"></span>24.  No man, then, hates himself.  On
this point, indeed, no question was ever raised by any sect.  But
neither does any man hate his own body.  For the apostle says truly, “No
man ever yet hated his own flesh.” <span
id="fr_1734"></span>[1735](#fn_1734)   And when some people say that
they would rather be without a body altogether, they entirely deceive
themselves.  For it is not their body, but its corruptions and its
heaviness, that they hate.  And so it is not no body, but an uncorrupted
and very light body, that they want.  But they think a body of that kind
would be no body at all, because they think such a thing as that must be
a spirit.  And as to the fact that they seem in some sort to scourge
their bodies by abstinence and toil, those who do this in the right
spirit do it not that they may get rid of their body, but that they may
have it in subjection and ready for every needful work.  For they strive
by a kind of toilsome exercise of the body itself to root out those
lusts that are hurtful to the body, that is, those habits and affections
of the soul that lead to the enjoyment of unworthy objects.  They are
not destroying themselves; they are taking care of their health.

<span id="v.iv.xxiv-p4"></span>25.  Those, on the other hand, who do
this in a perverse spirit, make war upon their own <span
id="page_529">p. 529</span> <span id="v.iv.xxiv-Page_529"></span> body
as if it were a natural enemy.  And in this matter they are led astray
by a mistaken interpretation of what they read:  “The flesh lusteth
against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and these are
contrary the one to the other.” <span
id="fr_1735"></span>[1736](#fn_1735)   For this is said of the carnal
habit yet unsubdued, against which the spirit lusteth, not to destroy
the body, but to eradicate the lust of the body—*i.e*., its evil
habit—and thus to make it subject to the spirit, which is what the order
of nature demands.  For as, after the resurrection, the body, having
become wholly subject to the spirit, will live in perfect peace to all
eternity; even in this life we must make it an object to have the carnal
habit changed for the better, so that its inordinate affections may not
war against the soul.  And until this shall take place, “the flesh
lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh;” the
spirit struggling, not in hatred, but for the mastery, because it
desires that what it loves should be subject to the higher principle;
and the flesh struggling, not in hatred, but because of the bondage of
habit which it has derived from its parent stock, and which has grown in
upon it by a law of nature till it has become inveterate.  The spirit,
then, in subduing the flesh, is working as it were to destroy the
ill-founded peace of an evil habit, and to bring about the real peace
which springs out of a good habit.  Nevertheless, not even those who,
led astray by false notions, hate their bodies would be prepared to
sacrifice one eye, even supposing they could do so without suffering any
pain, and that they had as much sight left in one as they formerly had
in two, unless some object was to be attained which would overbalance
the loss.  This and other indications of the same kind are sufficient to
show those who candidly seek the truth how well-founded is the statement
of the apostle when he says, “No man ever yet hated his own flesh.”  He
adds too, “but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the
Church.” <span id="fr_1736"></span>[1737](#fn_1736)
