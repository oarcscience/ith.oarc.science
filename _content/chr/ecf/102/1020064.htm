<p class="c21"><a name="iv.II_1.21-p2"></A>But if our adversaries do not care how foully and disgracefully the Roman republic be stained by corrupt practices, so long only as it holds together and continues in being, and if they therefore pooh-pooh the testimony of Sallust to its &#8220;utterly wicked and profligate&#8221; condition, what will they make of Cicero&#146;s statement, that even in his time it had become entirely extinct, and that there remained extant no Roman republic at all?&#160; He introduces Scipio (the Scipio who had destroyed Carthage) discussing the republic, at a time when already there were presentiments of its speedy ruin by that corruption which Sallust describes.&#160; In fact, at the time when the discussion took place, one of the Gracchi, who, according to Sallust, was the first great instigator of seditions, had already been put to death.&#160; His death, indeed, is mentioned in the same book.&#160; Now Scipio, at the end of the second book, says:&#160; &#8220;As among the different sounds which proceed from lyres, flutes, and the human voice, there must be maintained a certain harmony which a cultivated ear cannot endure to hear disturbed or jarring, but which may be elicited in full and absolute concord by the modulation even of voices very unlike one another; so, where reason is allowed to modulate the diverse elements of the state, there is obtained a perfect concord from the upper, lower, and middle classes as from various sounds; and what musicians call harmony in singing, is concord in matters of state, which is the strictest bond and best security of any republic, and which by no ingenuity can be retained where justice has become extinct.&#8221;&#160; Then, when he had expatiated somewhat more fully, and had more copiously illustrated the benefits of its presence and the ruinous effects of its absence upon a state, Pilus, one of the company present at the discussion, struck in and demanded that the question should be more thoroughly sifted, and that the subject of justice should be freely discussed for the sake of ascertaining what truth there was in the maxim which was then becoming daily more current, that &#8220;the republic cannot be governed without injustice.&#8221;&#160; Scipio expressed his willingness to have this maxim discussed and sifted, and gave it as his opinion that it was baseless, and that no progress could be made in discussing the republic unless it was established, not only that this maxim, that &#8220;the republic cannot be governed without injustice,&#8221; was false, but also that the truth is, that it cannot be governed without the most absolute justice.&#160; And the discussion of this question, being deferred till the next day, is carried on in the third book with great animation.&#160; For Pilus himself undertook to defend the position that the republic cannot be governed without injustice, at the same time being at special pains to clear himself of any real participation in that opinion.&#160; He advocated with great keenness the cause of injustice against justice, and endeavored by plausible reasons and examples to demonstrate that the former is beneficial, the latter useless, to the republic.&#160; Then, at the request of the company, L&aelig;lius attempted to defend justice, and strained every nerve to prove that nothing is so hurtful to a state as injustice; and that without justice a republic can neither be governed, nor even continue to exist.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.II_1.21-p3"></A>When this question has been handled to the satisfaction of the company, Scipio reverts to the original thread of discourse, and repeats with commendation his own brief definition of a republic, that it is the weal of the people.&#160; &#8220;The people&#8221; he defines as being not every assemblage or mob, but an assemblage associated by a common acknowledgment of law, and by a community of interests.&#160; Then he shows the use of definition in debate; and from these definitions of his own he gathers that a republic, or &#8220;weal of the people,&#8221; then exists only when it is well and justly governed, whether by a monarch, or an aristocracy, or by the whole people.&#160; But when the monarch is unjust, or, as the Greeks say, a tyrant; or the aristocrats are unjust, and form a faction; or the people themselves are unjust, and become, as Scipio for want of a better name calls them, themselves the tyrant, then the republic is not only blemished (as had been proved the day before), but by legitimate deduction from those definitions, it altogether ceases to be.&#160; For it could not be the people&#146;s weal when a tyrant factiously lorded it over the state; neither would the people be any longer a people if it were unjust, since it would no longer answer the definition of a people&#8212;&#8220;an assemblage associated by a common acknowledgment of law, and by a community of interests.&#8221;</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.II_1.21-p4"></A>When, therefore, the Roman republic was such as Sallust described it, it was not &#8220;utterly wicked and profligate,&#8221; as he says, but had altogether ceased to exist, if we are to admit the reasoning of that debate maintained on the subject of the republic by its best representatives.&#160; Tully himself, too, speaking not in the person of Scipio or any one else, but uttering his own sentiments, uses the following language in the beginning of the fifth book, after quoting a line from the poet Ennius, in which he said, &#8220;Rome&#146;s severe  <A NAME="page_36"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 36</FONT></A> <a name="iv.II_1.21-Page_36"></A>  morality and her citizens are her safeguard.&#8221;&#160; &#8220;This verse,&#8221; says Cicero, &#8220;seems to me to have all the sententious truthfulness of an oracle.&#160; For neither would the citizens have availed without the morality of the community, nor would the morality of the commons without outstanding men have availed either to establish or so long to maintain in vigor so grand a republic with so wide and just an empire.&#160; Accordingly, before our day, the hereditary usages formed our foremost men, and they on their part retained the usages and institutions of their fathers.&#160; But our age, receiving the republic as a <i>chef-d&#146;oeuvre</i> of another age which has already begun to grow old, has not merely neglected to restore the colors of the original, but has not even been at the pains to preserve so much as the general outline and most outstanding features.&#160; For what survives of that primitive morality which the poet called Rome&#146;s safeguard?&#160; It is so obsolete and forgotten, that, far from practising it, one does not even know it.&#160; And of the citizens what shall I say?&#160; Morality has perished through poverty of great men; a poverty for which we must not only assign a reason, but for the guilt of which we must answer as criminals charged with a capital crime.&#160; For it is through our vices, and not by any mishap, that we retain only the name of a republic, and have long since lost the reality.&#8221;</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.II_1.21-p5"></A>This is the confession of Cicero, long indeed after the death of Africanus, whom he introduced as an interlocutor in his work <i>De Republica</i>, but still before the coming of Christ.&#160; Yet, if the disasters he bewails had been lamented after the Christian religion had been diffused, and had begun to prevail, is there a man of our adversaries who would not have thought that they were to be imputed to the Christians?&#160; Why, then, did their gods not take steps then to prevent the decay and extinction of that republic, over the loss of which Cicero, long before Christ had come in the flesh, sings so lugubrious a dirge?&#160; Its admirers have need to inquire whether, even in the days of primitive men and morals, true justice flourished in it; or was it not perhaps even then, to use the casual expression of Cicero, rather a colored painting than the living reality?&#160; But, if God will, we shall consider this elsewhere.&#160; For I mean in its own place to show that&#8212;according to the definitions in which Cicero himself, using Scipio as his mouthpiece, briefly propounded what a republic is, and what a people is, and according to many testimonies, both of his own lips and of those who took part in that same debate&#8212;Rome never was a republic, because true justice had never a place in it.&#160; But accepting the more feasible definitions of a republic, I grant there was a republic of a certain kind, and certainly much better administered by the more ancient Romans than by their modern representatives.&#160; But the fact is, true justice has no existence save in that republic whose founder and ruler is Christ, if at least any choose to call this a republic; and indeed we cannot deny that it is the people&#146;s weal.&#160; But if perchance this name, which has become familiar in other connections, be considered alien to our common parlance, we may at all events say that in this city is true justice; the city of which Holy Scripture says, &#8220;Glorious things are said of thee, O city of God.&#8221;</p>
