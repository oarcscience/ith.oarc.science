id="iv.XIII.14-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—In What State Man Was Made by
God, and into What Estate He Fell by the Choice of His Own Will.</span>

<span id="iv.XIII.14-p2"></span>For God, the author of natures, not of
vices, created man upright; but man, being of his own will corrupted,
and justly condemned, begot corrupted and condemned children.  For we
all were in that one man, since we all were that one man, who fell into
sin by the woman who was made from him before the sin.  For not yet was
the particular form created and distributed to us, in which we as
individuals were to live, but already the seminal nature was there from
which we were to be propagated; and this being vitiated by sin, and
bound by the chain of death, and justly condemned, man could not be born
of man in any other state.  And thus, from the bad use of free will,
there originated the whole train of evil, which, with its concatenation
of miseries, convoys the human race from its depraved origin, as from a
corrupt root, on to the destruction of the second death, which has no
end, those only being excepted who are freed by the grace of God.
