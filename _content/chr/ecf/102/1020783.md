<span id="v.vi.iii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—How Pronunciation Serves to Remove
Ambiguity.  Different Kinds of Interrogation.</span>

<span id="v.vi.iii-p2"></span>6.  And all the directions that I have
given about ambiguous punctuations are to be observed likewise in the
case of doubtful pronunciations.  For these too, unless the fault lies
in the carelessness of the reader, are corrected either by the rule of
faith, or by a reference to the preceding or succeeding context; or if
neither of these methods is applied with success, they will remain
doubtful, but so that the reader will not be in fault in whatever way he
may pronounce them.  For example, if our faith that God will not bring
any charges against His elect, and that Christ will not condemn His
elect, did not stand in the way, this passage, “Who shall lay anything
to the charge <span id="page_558">p. 558</span> <span
id="v.vi.iii-Page_558"></span> of God’s elect?” might be pronounced in
such a way as to make what follows an answer to this question, “God who
justifieth,” and to make a second question, “Who is he that condemneth?”
with the answer, “Christ Jesus who died.” <span
id="fr_1842"></span>[1843](#fn_1842)   But as it would be the height of
madness to believe this, the passage will be pronounced in such a way as
to make the first part a question of inquiry, <span
id="fr_1843"></span>[1844](#fn_1843) and the second a rhetorical
interrogative. <span id="fr_1844"></span>[1845](#fn_1844)   Now the
ancients said that the difference between an inquiry and an
interrogative was this, that an inquiry admits of many answers, but to
an interrogative the answer must be either “No” or “Yes.” <span
id="fr_1845"></span>[1846](#fn_1845)   The passage will be pronounced,
then, in such a way that after the inquiry, “Who shall lay anything to
the charge of God’s elect?” what follows will be put as an
interrogative:  “Shall God who justifieth?”—the answer “No” being
understood.  And in the same way we shall have the inquiry, “Who is he
that condemneth?” and the answer here again in the form of an
interrogative, “Is it Christ who died? yea, rather, who is risen again?
who is even at the right hand of God? who also maketh intercession for
us?”—the answer “No” being understood to every one of these questions. 
On the other hand, in that passage where the apostle says, “What shall
we say then?  That the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness
have attained to righteousness;” <span
id="fr_1846"></span>[1847](#fn_1846) unless after the inquiry, “What
shall we say then?” what follows were given as the answer to this
question:  “That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness,
have attained to righteousness;” it would not be in harmony with the
succeeding context.  But with whatever tone of voice one may choose to
pronounce that saying of Nathanael’s, “Can any good thing come out of
Nazareth?” <span id="fr_1847"></span>[1848](#fn_1847) —whether with that
of a man who gives an affirmative answer, so that “out of Nazareth” is
the only part that belongs to the interrogation, or with that of a man
who asks the whole question with doubt and hesitation,—I do not see how
a difference can be made.  But neither sense is opposed to faith.

<span id="v.vi.iii-p9"></span>7.  There is, again, an ambiguity arising
out of the doubtful sound of syllables; and this of course has relation
to pronunciation.  For example, in the passage, “My bone \[*os meum*\]
was not hid from Thee, which Thou didst make in secret,” <span
id="fr_1848"></span>[1849](#fn_1848) it is not clear to the reader
whether he should take the word *os* as short or long.  If he make it
short, it is the singular of *ossa* \[bones\]; if he make it long, it is
the singular of *ora* \[mouths\].  Now difficulties such as this are
cleared up by looking into the original tongue, for in the Greek we find
not <span class="Greek"><span id="v.vi.iii-p10.2"></span>στόμα</span>
\[mouth\], but <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.vi.iii-p10.3"></span>ὁστέον</span> \[bone\].  And for this reason
the vulgar idiom is frequently more useful in conveying the sense than
the pure speech of the educated.  For I would rather have the barbarism,
*non est absconditum a te ossum meum*, <span
id="fr_1849"></span>[1850](#fn_1849) than have the passage in better
Latin, but the sense less clear.  But sometimes when the sound of a
syllable is doubtful, it is decided by a word near it belonging to the
same sentence.  As, for example, that saying of the apostle, “Of the
which I tell you before \[*prædico*\], as I have also told you in time
past \[*prœdixi*\], that they which do such things shall not inherit the
kingdom of God.” <span id="fr_1850"></span>[1851](#fn_1850)   Now if he
had only said, “Of the which I tell you before \[*quæ prædico vobis*\],”
and had not added, “as I have also told you in time past \[*sicut
prœdixi*\],” we could not know without going back to the original
whether in the word *prædico* the middle syllable should be pronounced
long or short.  But as it is, it is clear that it should be pronounced
long; for he does not say, *sicut prœdicavi*, but *sicut prædixi*.
