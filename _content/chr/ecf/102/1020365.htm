<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XII.26-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XII.26-p1.1"></A>Chapter 26.&#8212;Of that Opinion of the Platonists, that the Angels Were Themselves Indeed Created by God, But that Afterwards They Created Man&#146;s Body.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XII.26-p2"></A>It is obvious, that in attributing the creation of the other animals to those inferior gods who were made by the Supreme, he meant it to be understood that the immortal part was taken from God Himself, and that these minor creators added the mortal part; that is to say, he meant them to be considered the creators of our bodies, but not of our souls.&#160; But since Porphyry maintains that if the soul is to be purified all entanglement with a body must be escaped from; and at the same time agrees with Plato and the Platonistsin thinking that those who have not spent a temperate and honorable life return to mortal bodies as their punishment (to bodies of brutes in Plato&#146;s opinion, to human bodies in Porphyry&#146;s); it follows that those whom they would have us worship as our parents and authors, that they may plausibly call them gods, are, after all, but the forgers of our fetters and chains,&#8212;not our creators, but our jailers and turnkeys, who lock us up in the most bitter and melancholy house of correction.&#160; Let the Platonists, then, either cease menacing us with our bodies as the punishment of our souls, or preaching that we are to worship as gods those whose work upon us they exhort us by all means in our power to avoid and escape from.&#160; But, indeed, both opinions are quite false.&#160; It is false that souls return again to this life to be punished; and it is false that there is any other creator of anything in heaven or earth, than He who made the heaven and the earth.&#160; For if we live in a body only to expiate our sins, how says Plato in another place, that the world could not have been the most beautiful and good, had it not been filled with all kinds of creatures, mortal and immortal?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_574"></A><A HREF="#fn_574"><FONT SIZE="1">575</FONT></A>
&#160; But if our creation even as mortals be a divine benefit, how is it a punishment to be restored to a body, that is, to a divine benefit?&#160; And if God, as Plato continually maintains, embraced in His eternal intelligence the ideas both of the universe and of all the animals, how, then, should He not with His own hand make them all?&#160; Could He be unwilling to be the constructor of works, the idea and plan of which called for His ineffable and ineffably to be praised intelligence?</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.XII.26-p3"></A> The deity, desirous of making the universe in all respects resemble the most beautiful and entirely perfect of intelligible objects, formed it into one visible animal, containing within itself all the other animals with which it is naturally allied.&#8212;<i>Tim&aelig;us</i>, c. xi.</p>
