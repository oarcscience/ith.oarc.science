id="iv.IX.21-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—To What Extent the Lord Was
Pleased to Make Himself Known to the Demons.</span>

<span id="iv.IX.21-p2"></span>The devils themselves knew this
manifestation of God so well, that they said to the Lord though clothed
with the infirmity of flesh, “What have we to do with Thee, Jesus of
Nazareth?  Art Thou come to destroy us before the time?” <span
id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359)   From these words, it is clear that
they had great knowledge, and no charity.  They feared His power to
punish, and did not love His righteousness.  He made known to them so
much as He pleased, and He was pleased to make known so much as was
needful.  But He made Himself known not as to the holy angels, who know
Him as the Word of God, and rejoice in His eternity, which they partake,
but as was requisite to strike with terror the beings from whose tyranny
He was going to free those who were predestined to His kingdom and the
glory of it, eternally true and truly eternal.  He made Himself known,
therefore, to the demons, not by that which is life eternal, and the
unchangeable light which illumines the pious, whose souls are cleansed
by the faith that is in Him, but by some temporal effects of His power,
and evidences of His mysterious presence, which were more easily
discerned by the angelic senses even of wicked spirits than by human
infirmity.  But when He judged it advisable gradually to suppress these
signs, and to retire into deeper obscurity, the prince of the demons
doubted whether He were the Christ, and endeavored to ascertain this by
tempting Him, in so far as He permitted Himself to be tempted, that He
might adapt the manhood He wore to be an example for our imitation.  But
after that temptation, when, as Scripture says, He was ministered
to <span id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360) by the angels who are good
and holy, and therefore objects of terror to the impure spirits, He
revealed more and more distinctly to the demons how great He was, so
that, even though the infirmity of His flesh might seem contemptible,
none dared to resist His authority.
