<p class="c34"><a name="v.iv.xxxii-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="v.iv.xxxii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 32.&#8212;In What Way God Uses Man.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="v.iv.xxxii-p2"></A>35.&#160; But neither does He use after our fashion of using.&#160; For when we use objects, we do so with a view to the full enjoyment of the goodness of God.&#160; God, however, in His use of us, has reference to His own goodness.&#160; For it is because He is good we exist; and so far as we truly exist we are good.&#160; And, further, because He is also just, we cannot with impunity be evil; and so far as we are evil, so far is our existence less complete.&#160; Now He is the first and supreme existence, who is altogether unchangeable, and who could say in the fullest sense of the words, &#8220;I AM <span class="c20"><a name="v.iv.xxxii-p2.1"></A>That</span> I AM,&#8221; and &#8220;Thou shalt say to them, I AM hath sent me unto you;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1743"></A><A HREF="#fn_1743"><FONT SIZE="1">1744</FONT></A>
 so that all other things that exist, both owe their existence entirely to Him, and are good only so far as He has given it to them to be so.&#160; That use, then, which God is said to make of us has no reference to His own advantage, but to ours only; and, so far as He is concerned, has reference only to His goodness.  <A NAME="page_532"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 532</FONT></A> <a name="v.iv.xxxii-Page_532"></A>  When we take pity upon a man and care for him, it is for his advantage we do so; but somehow or other our own advantage follows by a sort of natural consequence, for God does not leave the mercy we show to him who needs it to go without reward.&#160; Now this is our highest reward, that we should fully enjoy Him, and that all who enjoy Him should enjoy one another in Him.</p>
