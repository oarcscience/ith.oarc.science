<span id="iv.VII.10-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VII.10-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Whether the Distinction Between
Janus and Jupiter is a Proper One.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.10-p2"></span>Since, therefore, Janus is the world, and
Jupiter is the world, wherefore are Janus and Jupiter two gods, while
the world is but one?  Why do they have separate temples, separate
altars, different rites, dissimilar images?  If it be because the nature
of beginnings is one, <span id="page_129">p. 129</span> <span
id="iv.VII.10-Page_129"></span> and the nature of causes another, and
the one has received the name of Janus, the other of Jupiter; is it then
the case, that if one man has two distinct offices of authority, or two
arts, two judges or two artificers are spoken of, because the nature of
the offices or the arts is different?  So also with respect to one god: 
if he have the power of beginnings and of causes, must he therefore be
thought to be two gods, because beginnings and causes are two things? 
But if they think that this is right, let them also affirm that Jupiter
is as many gods as they have given him surnames, on account of many
powers; for the things from which these surnames are applied to him are
many and diverse.  I shall mention a few of them.
