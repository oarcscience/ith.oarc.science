Clearly, But Not Inelegantly.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.11-p2"></span>26.  For teaching, of course, true
eloquence consists, not in making people like what they disliked, nor in
making them do what they shrank from, but in making clear what was
obscure; yet if this be done without grace of style, the benefit does
not extend beyond the few eager students who are anxious to know
whatever is to be learnt, however rude and unpolished the form in which
it is put; and who, when they have succeeded in their object, find the
plain truth pleasant food enough.  And it is one of the distinctive
features of good intellects not to love words, but the truth in words. 
For of what service is a golden key, if it cannot open what we want it
to open?  Or what objection is there to a wooden one if it can, seeing
that to open what is shut is all we want?  But as there is a certain
analogy between learning and eating, the very food without which it is
impossible to live must be flavored to meet the tastes of the majority.
