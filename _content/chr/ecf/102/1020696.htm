<p class="c31"><a name="v.iv-p4"></A>Argument&#8212;The author divides his work into two parts, one relating to the discovery, the other to the expression, of the true sense of scripture.&#160; He shows that to discover the meaning we must attend both to things and to signs, as it is necessary to know what things we ought to teach to the Christian people, and also the signs of these things, that is, where the knowledge of these things is to be sought.&#160; In this first book he treats of things, which he divides into three classes,&#8212;things to be enjoyed, things to be used, and things which use and enjoy.&#160; The only object which ought to be enjoyed is the triune God, who is our highest good and our true happiness.&#160; We are prevented by our sins from enjoying God; and that our sins might be taken away, &#8220;the word was made flesh,&#8221; our Lord suffered, and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, taking to himself as his bride the church, in which we receive remission of our sins.&#160; And if our sins are remitted and our souls renewed by grace, we may await with hope the resurrection of the body to eternal glory; if not, we shall be raised to everlasting punishment.&#160; These matters relating to faith having been expounded, the author goes on to show that all objects, except God, are for use; for, though some of them may be loved, yet our love is not to rest in them, but to have reference to God.&#160; And we ourselves are not objects of enjoyment to God; he uses us, but for our own advantage.&#160; He then goes on to show that love&#8212;the love of God for his own sake and the love of our neighbor for God&#146;s sake&#8212;is the fulfillment and the end of all Scripture.&#160; After adding a few words about hope, he shows, in conclusion, that faith, hope, and love are graces essentially necessary for him who would understand and explain aright the Holy Scriptures.</p>
