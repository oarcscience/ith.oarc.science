Expressions.</span>

overthrown, charity reigns through its supremely just laws of love to
God for His own sake, and love to one’s self and one’s neighbor for
God’s sake.  Accordingly, in regard to figurative expressions, a rule
such as the following will be observed, to carefully turn over in our
minds and meditate upon what we read till an interpretation be found
that tends to establish the reign of love.  Now, if when taken literally
it at once gives a meaning of this kind, the expression is not to be
considered figurative.
