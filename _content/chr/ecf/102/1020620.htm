<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XX.18-p2"></A>Let us now see what the Apostle Peter predicted concerning this judgment.&#160; &#8220;There shall come,&#8221; he says, &#8220;in the last days scoffers. . . . Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1402"></A><A HREF="#fn_1402"><FONT SIZE="1">1403</FONT></A>
&#160; There is nothing said here about the resurrection of the dead, but enough certainly regarding the destruction of this world.&#160; And by his reference to the deluge he seems as it were to suggest to us how far we should believe the ruin of the world will extend in the end of the world.&#160; For he says that the world which then was perished, and not only the earth itself, but also the heavens, by which we understand the air, the place and room of which was occupied by the water.&#160; Therefore the whole, or almost the whole, of the gusty atmosphere (which he calls heaven, or rather the heavens, meaning the earth&#146;s atmosphere, and not the upper air in which sun, moon, and stars are set) was turned into moisture, and in this way perished together with the earth, whose former appearance had been destroyed by the deluge.&#160; &#8220;But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.&#8221;&#160; Therefore the heavens and the earth, or the world which was preserved from the water to stand in place of that world which perished in the flood, is itself reserved to fire at last in the day of the judgment and perdition of ungodly men.&#160; He does not hesitate to affirm that in this great change men also shall perish:&#160; their nature, however, shall notwithstanding continue, though in eternal punishments.&#160; Some one will perhaps put the question, If after judgment is pronounced the world itself is to burn, where shall the saints be during the conflagration, and before it is replaced by a new heavens and a new earth, since somewhere they must be, because they have material bodies?&#160; We may reply that they shall be in the upper regions into which the flame of that conflagration shall not ascend, as neither did the water of the flood; for they shall have such bodies that they shall be wherever they wish.&#160; Moreover, when they have become immortal and incorruptible, they shall not greatly dread the blaze of that conflagration, as the corruptible and mortal bodies of the three men were able to live unhurt in the blazing furnace.</p>
