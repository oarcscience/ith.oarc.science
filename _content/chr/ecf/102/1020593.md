<span id="iv.XIX.20-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIX.20-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—That the Saints are in This Life
Blessed in Hope.</span>

<span id="iv.XIX.20-p2"></span>Since, then, the supreme good of the city
of God is perfect and eternal peace, not such as mortals pass into and
out of by birth and death, but the peace of freedom from all evil, in
which the immortals ever abide; who can deny that that future life is
most blessed, or that, in comparison with it, this life which now we
live is most wretched, be it filled with all blessings of body and soul
and external things?  And yet, if any man uses this life with a
reference to that other which he ardently loves and confidently hopes
for, he may well be called even now blessed, though not in reality so
much as in hope.  But the actual possession of the happiness of this
life, without the hope of what is beyond, is but a false happiness and
profound misery.  For the true blessings of the soul are not now
enjoyed; for that is no true wisdom which does not direct all its
prudent observations, manly actions, virtuous self-restraint, and just
arrangements, to that end in which God shall be all and all in a secure
eternity and perfect peace.
