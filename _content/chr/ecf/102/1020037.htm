<p class="c34"><a name="iv.ii.xxxii-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.ii.xxxii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 31.&#8212;By What Steps the Passion for Governing Increased Among the Romans.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.ii.xxxii-p2"></A>For at what stage would that passion rest when once it has lodged in a proud spirit, until by a succession of advances it has reached even the throne.&#160; And to obtain such advances nothing avails but unscrupulous ambition.&#160; But unscrupulous ambition has nothing to work upon, save in a nation corrupted by avarice and luxury.&#160; Moreover, a people becomes avaricious and luxurious by prosperity; and it was this which that very prudent man Nasica was endeavouring to avoid when he opposed the destruction of the greatest, strongest, wealthiest city of Rome&#146;s enemy.&#160; He thought that thus fear would act as a curb on lust, and that lust being curbed would not run riot in luxury, and that luxury being prevented avarice would be at an end; and that these vices being banished, virtue would flourish and increase the great profit of the state; and liberty, the fit companion of virtue, would abide unfettered.&#160; For similar reasons, and animated by the same considerate patriotism, that same chief pontiff of yours&#8212;I still refer to him who was adjudged Rome&#146;s best man without one dissentient voice&#8212;threw cold water on the proposal of the senate to build a circle of seats round the theatre, and in a very weighty speech warned them against allowing the luxurious manners of Greece to sap the Roman manliness, and persuaded them not to yield to the enervating and emasculating influence of foreign licentiousness.&#160; So authoritative and forcible were his words, that the senate was moved to prohibit the use even of those benches which hitherto had been customarily brought to the theatre for the temporary use of the citizens.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">85</FONT></A>
&#160; How eagerly would such a man as this have banished from Rome the scenic exhibitions themselves, had he dared to oppose the authority of those whom he supposed to be gods!&#160; For he did not know that they were malicious devils; or if he did, he supposed they should rather be propitiated than despised.&#160; For there had not yet been revealed to the Gentiles the heavenly doctrine which should purify their hearts by faith, and transform their natural disposition by humble godliness, and turn them from the service of proud devils to seek the things that are in heaven, or even above the heavens.</p>
