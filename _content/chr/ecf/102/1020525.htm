<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVIII.7-p2"></A>In the reign of Mamitus, the twelfth king of Assyria, and Plemn&aelig;us, the eleventh of Sicyon, while Argus still reigned over the Argives, Joseph died in Egypt a hundred and ten years old.&#160; After his death, the people of God, increasing wonderfully, remained in Egypt a hundred and forty-five years, in tranquillity at first, until those who knew Joseph were dead.&#160; Afterward, through envy of their increase, and the suspicion that they would at length gain their freedom, they were oppressed with persecutions and the labors of intolerable servitude, amid which, however, they still grew, being multiplied with God-given fertility.&#160; During this period the same kingdoms continued in Assyria and Greece.</p>
