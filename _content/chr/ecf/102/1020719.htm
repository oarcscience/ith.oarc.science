<p class="c34"><a name="v.iv.xxiii-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="v.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 23.&#8212;Man Needs No Injunction to Love Himself and His Own Body.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="v.iv.xxiii-p2"></A>22.&#160; Those things which are objects of use are not all, however, to be loved, but those only which are either united with us in a common relation to God, such as a man or an angel, or are so related to us as to need the goodness of God through our instrumentality, such as the body.&#160; For assuredly the martyrs did not love the wickedness of their persecutors, although they used it to attain the favor of God.&#160; As, then, there are four kinds of things that are to be loved,&#8212;first, that which is above us; second, ourselves; third, that which is on a level with us; fourth, that which is beneath us,&#8212;no precepts need be given about the second and fourth of these.&#160; For, however far a man may fall away from the truth, he still continues to love himself, and to love his own body.&#160; The soul which flies away from the unchangeable Light, the Ruler of all things, does so that it may rule over itself and over its own body; and so it cannot but love both itself and its own body.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="v.iv.xxiii-p3"></A>23.&#160; Morever, it thinks it has attained something very great if it is able to lord it over its companions, that is, other men.&#160; For it is inherent in the sinful soul to desire above all things, and to claim as due to itself, that which is properly due to God only.&#160; Now such love of itself is more correctly called hate.&#160; For it is not just that it should desire what is beneath it to be obedient to it while itself will not obey its own superior; and most justly has it been said, &#8220;He who loveth iniquity hateth his own soul.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1733"></A><A HREF="#fn_1733"><FONT SIZE="1">1734</FONT></A>
&#160; And accordingly the soul becomes weak, and endures much suffering about the mortal body.&#160; For, of course, it must love the body, and be grieved at its corruption; and the immortality and incorruptibility of the body spring out of the health of the soul.&#160; Now the health of the soul is to cling steadfastly to the better part, that is, to the unchangeable God.&#160; But when it aspires to lord it even over those who are by nature its equals,&#8212;that is, its fellow-men,&#8212;this is a reach of arrogance utterly intolerable.</p>
