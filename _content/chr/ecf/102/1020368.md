id="iv.XIII.1-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—Of the Fall of the First Man,
Through Which Mortality Has Been Contracted.</span>

<span id="iv.XIII.1-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.XIII.1-p2.1"></span>Having</span> disposed of the very difficult
questions concerning the origin of our world and the beginning of the
human race, the natural order requires that we now discuss the fall of
the first man (we may say of the first men), and of the origin and
propagation of human death.  For God had not made man like the angels,
in such a condition that, even though they had sinned, they could none
the more die.  He had so made them, that if they discharged the
obligations of obedience, an angelic immortality and a blessed eternity
might ensue, without the intervention of death; but if they disobeyed,
death should be visited on them with just sentence—which, too, has been
spoken to in the preceding book.
