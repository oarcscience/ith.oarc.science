<p class="c21"><a name="v.v.x-p2"></A>15.&#160; Now there are two causes which prevent what is written from being understood:&#160; its being vailed either under unknown, or under ambiguous signs.&#160; Signs are either proper or figurative.&#160; They are called proper when they are used to point out the objects they were designed to point out, as we say <i>bos</i> when we mean an ox, because all men who with us use the Latin tongue call it by this name.&#160; Signs are figurative when the things themselves which we indicate by the proper names are used to signify something else, as we say <i>bos</i>, and understand by that syllable the ox, which is ordinarily called by that name; but then further by that ox understand a preacher of the gospel, as Scripture signifies, according to the apostle&#146;s explanation, when it says:&#160; &#8220;Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1772"></A><A HREF="#fn_1772"><FONT SIZE="1">1773</FONT></A>
