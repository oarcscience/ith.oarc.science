<p class="c21"><a name="iv.IX.9-p2"></A>How, then, can men hope for a favorable introduction to the friendship of the gods by such mediators as these, who are, like men, defective in that which is the better part of every living creature, viz., the soul, and who resemble the gods only in the body, which is the inferior part?&#160; For a living creature or animal consists of soul and body, and of these two parts the soul is undoubtedly the better; even though vicious and weak, it is obviously better than even the soundest and strongest body, for the greater excellence of its nature is not reduced to the level of the body even by the pollution of vice, as gold, even when tarnished, is more precious than the purest silver or lead.&#160; And yet these mediators, by whose interposition things human and divine are to be harmonized, have an eternal body in common with the gods, and a vicious soul in common with men,&#8212;as if the religion by which these demons are to unite gods and men were a bodily, and not a spiritual matter.&#160; What wickedness, then, or punishment has suspended these false and deceitful mediators, as it were head downwards, so that their inferior part, their body, is linked to the gods above, and their superior part, the soul, bound to men beneath; united to the celestial gods by the part that serves, and miserable, together with the inhabitants of earth, by the part that rules?&#160; For the body is the servant, as Sallust says:&#160; &#8220;We use the soul to rule, the body to obey;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_346"></A><A HREF="#fn_346"><FONT SIZE="1">347</FONT></A>
 adding, &#8220;the one we have in common with the gods, the other with the brutes.&#8221;&#160; For he was here speaking of men; and they have, like the brutes, a mortal body.&#160; These demons, whom our philosophic friends have provided for us as mediators with the gods, may indeed say of the soul and body, the one we have in common with the gods, the other with men; but, as I said, they are as it were suspended and bound head downwards, having the slave, the body, in common with the gods, the master, the soul, in common with miserable men,&#8212;their inferior part exalted, their superior part depressed.&#160; And therefore, if any one supposes that, because they are not subject, like terrestrial animals, to the separation of soul and body by death, they therefore resemble the gods in their eternity, their body must not be considered a chariot of an eternal triumph, but rather the chain of an eternal punishment.</p>
