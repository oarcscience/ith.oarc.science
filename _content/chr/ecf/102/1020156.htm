<p class="c21"><a name="iv.V.15-p2"></A>Now, therefore, with regard to those to whom God did not purpose to give eternal life with His holy angels in His own celestial city, to the society of which that true piety which does not render the service of religion, which the Greeks call <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.V.15-p2.1"></A> &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8055;&#945;</span>, to any save the true God conducts, if He had also withheld from them the terrestrial glory of that most excellent empire, a reward would not have been rendered to their good arts,&#8212;that is, their virtues,&#8212;by which they sought to attain so great glory.&#160; For as to those who seem to do some good that they may receive glory from men, the Lord also says, &#8220;Verily I say unto you, they have received their reward.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_215"></A><A HREF="#fn_215"><FONT SIZE="1">216</FONT></A>
&#160; So also these despised their own private affairs for the sake of the republic, and for its treasury resisted avarice, consulted for the good of their country with a spirit of freedom, addicted neither to what their laws pronounced to be crime nor to lust.&#160; By all these acts, as by the true way, they pressed forward to honors, power, and glory; they were honored among almost all nations; they imposed the laws of their empire upon many nations; and at this day, both in literature and history, they are glorious among almost all nations.&#160; There is no reason why they should complain against the justice of the supreme and true God,&#8212;&#8220;they have received their reward.&#8221;</p>
