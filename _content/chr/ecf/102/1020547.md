<span id="iv.XVIII.29-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVIII.29-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29.—What Things are Predicted by
Isaiah Concerning Christ and the Church.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.29-p2"></span>The prophecy of Isaiah is not in the
book of the twelve prophets, who are called the minor from the brevity
of their writings, as compared with those who are called the greater
prophets because they published larger volumes.  Isaiah belongs to the
latter, yet I connect him with the two above named, because he
prophesied at the same time.  Isaiah, then, together with his rebukes of
wickedness, precepts of righteousness, and predictions of evil, also
prophesied much more than the rest about Christ and the Church, that is,
about the King and that city which he founded; so that some say he
should be called an evangelist rather than a prophet.  But, in order to
finish this work, I quote only one out of many in this place.  Speaking
in the person of the Father, he says, “Behold, my servant shall
understand, and shall be exalted and glorified very much.  As many shall
be astonished at Thee.” <span id="fr_1162"></span>[1163](#fn_1162)  This
is about Christ.

<span id="iv.XVIII.29-p4"></span>But let us now hear what follows about
the Church.  He says, “Rejoice, O barren, thou that barest not; break
forth and cry, thou that didst not travail with child:  for many more
are the children of the desolate than of her that has an husband.” <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[1164](#fn_1163)   But these must suffice; and some
things in them ought to be expounded; yet I think those parts sufficient
which are so plain that even enemies must be compelled against their
will to understand them.
