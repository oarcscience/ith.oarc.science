<span id="iv.ii.i-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.i-p1.1"></span>Preface, Explaining His Design in Undertaking
This Work.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.i-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ii.i-p2.1"></span>The</span> glorious city of God <span
id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27) is my theme in this work, which you, my
dearest son Marcellinus, <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28) suggested,
and which is due to you by my promise.  I have undertaken its defence
against those who prefer their own gods to the Founder of this city,—a
city surpassingly glorious, whether we view it as it still lives by
faith in this fleeting course of time, and sojourns as a stranger in the
midst of the ungodly, or as it shall dwell in the fixed stability of its
eternal seat, which it now with patience waits for, expecting until
“righteousness shall return unto judgment,” <span
id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29) and it obtain, by virtue of its
excellence, final victory and perfect peace.  A great work this, and an
arduous; but God is my helper.  For I am aware what ability is requisite
to persuade the proud how great is the virtue of humility, which raises
us, not by a quite human arrogance, but by a divine grace, above all
earthly dignities that totter on this shifting scene.  For the King and
Founder of this city of which we speak, has in Scripture uttered to His
people a dictum of the divine law in these words:  “God resisteth the
proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.” <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30)   But this, which is God’s prerogative,
the inflated ambition of a proud spirit also affects, and dearly loves
that this be numbered among its attributes, to

<span id="iv.ii.i-p7"></span>“Show pity to the humbled soul,

<span id="iv.ii.i-p8"></span>And crush the sons of pride.” <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31)

<span id="iv.ii.i-p10"></span>And therefore, as the plan of this work we
have undertaken requires, and as occasion offers, we must speak also of
the earthly city, which, though it be mistress of the nations, is itself
ruled by its lust of rule.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p3"></span> \[Augustin uses the term *civitas Dei*
(<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.ii.i-p3.1"></span>πόλις θεοῦ</span>)
of the church universal as a commonwealth and community founded and
governed by God.  It is applied in the Bible to Jerusalem or the church
of the Old Covenant ([Ps. 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004), [Ps.
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#008), [Ps.
87:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003)<span id="iv.ii.i-p3.2"></span>),
and to the heavenly Jerusalem or the church perfect ([Heb.
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016), [Heb.
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022), [Rev.
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012), [Rev.
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002), [Rev.
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#019)<span id="iv.ii.i-p3.3"></span>). 
Augustin comprehends under the term the whole Kingdom of God under the
Jewish and Christian dispensation both in its militant and triumphant
state, and contrasts it with the perishing kingdoms of this *world*. 
His work treats of both, but he calls it, *a meliore, The City of
God.*—P.S.\]

<span id="iv.ii.i-p4"></span> \[Marcellinus was a friend of Augustin,
and urged him to write this work.  He was commissioned by the Emperior
Honorius to convene a conference of Catholic and schismatic Donatist
bishops in the summer of 411, and conceded the victory to the Catholics;
but on account of his rigor in executing the laws against the Donatists,
he fell a victim to their revenge, and was honored by a place among the
martyrs.  See the Letters of Augustin, 133, 136, 138, 139, 143, 151, the
notes in this ed., vol. I., 470 and 505, and the Translator’s Preface
—P.S.\]

rendered otherwise in Eng. ver. \[In the Revised Vers.:  “Judgment shall
return unto righteousness.”  In Old Testament quotations, Augustin,
being ignorant of Hebrew, had to rely on the imperfect Latin version of
his day, and was at first even opposed to the revision of Jerome.—P.S.\]
