id="iv.XVIII.26-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—That at the Time When the
Captivity of the Jews Was Brought to an End, on the Completion of
Seventy Years, the Romans Also Were Freed from Kingly Rule.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.26-p2"></span>At this time, Cyrus king of Persia, who
also ruled the Chaldeans and Assyrians, having somewhat relaxed the
captivity of the Jews, made fifty thousand of them return in order to
rebuild the temple.  They only began the first foundations and built the
altar; but, owing to hostile invasions, they were unable to go on, and
the work was put off to the time of Darius.  During the same time also
those things were done which are written in the book of Judith, which,
indeed, the Jews are said not to have received into the canon of the
Scriptures.  Under Darius king of Persia, then, on the completion of the
seventy years predicted by Jeremiah the prophet, the captivity of the
Jews was brought to an end, and they were restored to liberty.  Tarquin
then reigned as the seventh king of the Romans.  On his expulsion, they
also began to be free from the rule of their kings.  Down to this time
the people of Israel had prophets; but, although they were numerous, the
canonical <span id="page_375">p. 375</span> <span
id="iv.XVIII.26-Page_375"></span> writings of only a few of them have
been preserved among the Jews and among us.  In closing the previous
book, I promised to set down something in this one about them, and I
shall now do so.
