<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVI.19-p2"></A>Having built an altar there, and called upon God, Abraham proceeded thence and dwelt in the desert, and was compelled by pressure of famine to go on into Egypt.&#160; There he called his wife his sister, and told no lie.&#160; For she was this also, because she was near of blood; just as Lot, on account of the same nearness, being his brother&#146;s son, is called his brother.&#160; Now he did not deny that she was his wife, but held his peace about it, committing to God the defence of his wife&#146;s chastity, and providing as a man against human wiles; because if he had not provided against the danger as much as he could, he would have been tempting God rather than trusting in Him.&#160; We have said enough about this matter against the calumnies of Faustus the Manich&aelig;an.&#160; At last what Abraham had expected the Lord to do took place.&#160; For Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who had taken her to him as his wife, restored her to her husband on being severely plagued.&#160; And far be it from us to believe that she was defiled by lying with another; because it is much more credible that, by these great afflictions, Pharaoh was not permitted to do this.</p>
