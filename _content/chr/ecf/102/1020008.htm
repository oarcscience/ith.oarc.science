<p class="c26"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p2"></A>There are histories of numberless wars, both before the building of Rome and since its rise and the extension of its dominion; let these be read, and let one instance be cited in which, when a city had been taken by foreigners, the victors spared those who were found to have fled for sanctuary to the temples of their gods;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A>
 or one instance in which a barbarian general gave orders that none should be put to the sword who had been found in this or that temple.&#160; Did not &AElig;neas see</p>

</p>  
<p class="c36"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p7"></A>Did not Diomede and Ulysses</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p8"></A>&#8220;Drag with red hands, the sentry slain,</p>  
<p class="c28"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p9"></A>Her fateful image from your fane,</p>  
<p class="c28"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p10"></A>Her chaste locks touch, and stain with gore</p>  
<p class="c33"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p11"></A>The virgin coronal she wore?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A>

<p class="c33"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p15"></A>And Greece grew weak.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p17"></A>For after this they conquered and destroyed Troy with fire and sword; after this they beheaded Priam as he fled to the altars.&#160; Neither did Troy perish because it lost Minerva.&#160; For what had Minerva herself first lost, that she should perish?&#160; Her guards perhaps?&#160; No doubt; just her guards.&#160; For as soon as they were slain, she could be stolen.&#160; It was not, in fact, the men who were preserved by the image, but the image by the men.&#160; How,  <A NAME="page_3"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 3</FONT></A> <a name="iv.ii.iii-Page_3"></A>  then, was she invoked to defend the city and the citizens, she who could not defend her own defenders?</p>
