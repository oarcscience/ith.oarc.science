<p class="c21"><a name="iv.III.20-p2"></A>But among all the disasters of the second Punic war, there occurred none more lamentable, or calculated to excite deeper complaint, than the fate of the Saguntines.&#160; This city of Spain, eminently friendly to Rome, was destroyed by its fidelity to the Roman people.&#160; For when Hannibal had broken treaty with the Romans, he sought occasion for provoking them to war, and accordingly made a fierce assault upon Saguntum.&#160; When this was reported at Rome, ambassadors were sent to Hannibal, urging him to raise the siege; and when this remonstrance was neglected, they proceeded to Carthage, lodged complaint against the breaking of the treaty, and returned  <A NAME="page_57"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 57</FONT></A> <a name="iv.III.20-Page_57"></A>  to Rome without accomplishing their object.&#160; Meanwhile the siege went on; and in the eighth or ninth month, this opulent but ill-fated city, dear as it was to its own state and to Rome, was taken, and subjected to treatment which one cannot read, much less narrate, without horror.&#160; And yet, because it bears directly on the matter in hand, I will briefly touch upon it.&#160; First, then, famine wasted the Saguntines, so that even human corpses were eaten by some:&#160; so at least it is recorded.&#160; Subsequently, when thoroughly worn out, that they might at least escape the ignominy of falling into the hands of Hannibal, they publicly erected a huge funeral pile, and cast themselves into its flames, while at the same time they slew their children and themselves with the sword.&#160; Could these gods, these debauchees and gourmands, whose mouths water for fat sacrifices, and whose lips utter lying divinations,&#8212;could they not do anything in a case like this?&#160; Could they not interfere for the preservation of a city closely allied to the Roman people, or prevent it perishing for its fidelity to that alliance of which they themselves had been the mediators?&#160; Saguntum, faithfully keeping the treaty it had entered into before these gods, and to which it had firmly bound itself by an oath, was besieged, taken, and destroyed by a perjured person.&#160; If afterwards, when Hannibal was close to the walls of Rome, it was the gods who terrified him with lightning and tempest, and drove him to a distance, why, I ask, did they not thus interfere before?&#160; For I make bold to say, that this demonstration with the tempest would have been more honorably made in defence of the allies of Rome&#8212;who were in danger on account of their reluctance to break faith with the Romans, and had no resources of their own&#8212;than in defence of the Romans themselves, who were fighting in their own cause, and had abundant resources to oppose Hannibal.&#160; If, then, they had been the guardians of Roman prosperity and glory, they would have preserved that glory from the stain of this Saguntine disaster; and how silly it is to believe that Rome was preserved from destruction at the hands of Hannibal by the guardian care of those gods who were unable to rescue the city of Saguntum from perishing through its fidelity to the alliance of Rome.&#160; If the population of Saguntum had been Christian, and had suffered as it did for the Christian faith (though, of course, Christians would not have used fire and sword against their own persons), they would have suffered with that hope which springs from faith in Christ&#8212;the hope not of a brief temporal reward, but of unending and eternal bliss.&#160; What, then, will the advocates and apologists of these gods say in their defence, when charged with the blood of these Saguntines; for they are professedly worshipped and invoked for this very purpose of securing prosperity in this fleeting and transitory life?&#160; Can anything be said but what was alleged in the case of Regulus&#146; death?&#160; For though there is a difference between the two cases, the one being an individual, the other a whole community, yet the cause of destruction was in both cases the keeping of their plighted troth.&#160; For it was this which made Regulus willing to return to his enemies, and this which made the Saguntines unwilling to revolt to their enemies.&#160; Does, then, the keeping of faith provoke the gods to anger?&#160; Or is it possible that not only individuals, but even entire communities, perish while the gods are propitious to them?&#160; Let our adversaries choose which alternative they will.&#160; If, on the one hand, those gods are enraged at the keeping of faith, let them enlist perjured persons as their worshippers.&#160; If, on the other hand, men and states can suffer great and terrible calamities, and at last perish while favored by the gods, then does their worship not produce happiness as its fruit.&#160; Let those, therefore, who suppose that they have fallen into distress because their religious worship has been abolished, lay aside their anger; for it were quite possible that did the gods not only remain with them, but regard them with favor, they might yet be left to mourn an unhappy lot, or might, even like Regulus and the Saguntines, be horribly tormented, and at last perish miserably.</p>
