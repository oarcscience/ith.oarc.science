<span id="iv.VII.14-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VII.14-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Concerning the Offices of Mercury
and Mars.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.14-p2"></span>But they have not found how to refer
Mercury and Mars to any parts of the world, and to the works of God
which are in the elements; and therefore they have set them at least
over human works, making them assistants in speaking and in carrying on
wars.  Now Mercury, if he has also the power of the speech of the gods,
rules also over the king of the gods himself, if Jupiter, as he receives
from him the faculty of speech, also speaks according as it is his
pleasure to permit him—which surely is absurd; but if it is only the
power over human speech which is held to be attributed to him, then we
say it is incredible that Jupiter should have condescended to give the
pap not only to children, but also to beasts—from which he has been
surnamed Ruminus—and yet should have been unwilling that the care of our
speech, by which we excel the beasts, should pertain to him.  And thus
speech itself both belongs to Jupiter, and is Mercury.  But if speech
itself is said to be Mercury, as those things which are said concerning
him by way of interpretation show it to be;—for he is said to have been
called Mercury, that is, he who runs between, <span
id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275) because speech runs between men:  they
say also that the Greeks call him <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.VII.14-p3.1"></span>῾Ερμῆς</span>, because speech, or
interpretation, which certainly belongs to speech, is called by them
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.VII.14-p3.2"></span>ἑρμηνεία</span>: 
also he is said to preside over payments, because speech passes between
sellers and buyers:  the wings, too, which he has on his head and on his
feet, they say mean that speech passes winged through the air:  he is
also said to have been called the messenger, <span
id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276) because by means of speech all our
thoughts are expressed; <span id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277) —if,
therefore, speech itself is Mercury, then, even by their own confession,
he is not a god.  But when they make to themselves gods of such as are
not even <span id="page_131">p. 131</span> <span
id="iv.VII.14-Page_131"></span> demons, by praying to unclean spirits,
they are possessed by such as are not gods, but demons.  In like manner,
because they have not been able to find for Mars any element or part of
the world in which he might perform some works of nature of whatever
kind, they have said that he is the god of war, which is a work of men,
and that not one which is considered desirable by them.  If, therefore,
Felicitas should give perpetual peace, Mars would have nothing to do. 
But if war itself is Mars, as speech is Mercury, I wish it were as true
that there were no war to be falsely called a god, as it is true that it
is not a god.
