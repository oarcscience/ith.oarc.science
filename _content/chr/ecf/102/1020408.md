id="iv.XIV.16-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—Of the Evil of Lust,—A Word
Which, Though Applicable to Many Vices, is Specially Appropriated to
Sexual Uncleanness.</span>

<span id="iv.XIV.16-p2"></span>Although, therefore, lust may have many
objects, yet when no object is specified, the word lust usually suggests
to the mind the lustful excitement of the organs of generation.  And
this lust not only takes possession of the whole body and outward
members, but also makes itself felt within, and moves the whole man with
a passion in which mental emotion is mingled with bodily appetite, so
that the pleasure which results is the greatest of all bodily
pleasures.  So possessing indeed is this pleasure, that at the moment of
time in which it is consummated, all mental activity is suspended.  What
friend of wisdom and holy joys, who, being married, but knowing, as the
apostle says, “how to possess his vessel in santification and honor, not
in the disease of desire, as the Gentiles who know not God,” <span

ble, to beget children without this lust, so that in this function of
begetting offspring the members created for this purpose should not be
stimulated by the heat of lust, but should be actuated by his volition,
in the same way as his other members serve him for their respective
ends?  But even those who delight in this pleasure are not moved to it
at their own will, whether they confine themselves to lawful or
transgress to unlawful pleasures; but sometimes this lust importunes
them in spite of themselves, and sometimes fails them when they desire
to feel it, so that though lust rages in the mind, it stirs not in the
body.  Thus, strangely enough, this emotion not only fails to obey the
legitimate desire to beget offspring, but also refuses to serve
lascivious lust; and though it often opposes its whole combined energy
to the soul that resists it, sometimes also it is divided against
itself, and while it moves the soul, leaves the body unmoved.
