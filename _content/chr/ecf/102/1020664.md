<span id="iv.XXII.3-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXII.3-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—Of the Promise of Eternal
Blessedness to the Saints, and Everlasting Punishment to the
Wicked.</span>

<span id="iv.XXII.3-p2"></span>Wherefore, not to mention many other
instances besides, as we now see in Christ the fulfillment of that which
God promised to Abraham when He said, “In thy seed shall all nations be
blessed,” <span id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607) so this also shall
be fulfilled which He promised to the same race, when He said by the
prophet, “They that are in their sepulchres shall rise again,” <span
id="fr_1608"></span>[1609](#fn_1608) and also, “There shall be a new
heaven and a new earth:  and the former shall not be mentioned, nor come
into mind; but they shall find joy and rejoicing in it:  for I will make
Jerusalem a rejoicing, and my people a joy.  And I will rejoice in
Jerusalem, and joy in <span id="page_481">p. 481</span> <span
id="iv.XXII.3-Page_481"></span> my people, and the voice of weeping
shall be no more heard in her.” <span
id="fr_1609"></span>[1610](#fn_1609)   And by another prophet He uttered
the same prediction:  “At that time thy people shall be delivered, every
one that shall be found written in the book.  And many of them that
sleep in the dust” (or, as some interpret it, “in the mound”) “of the
earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and
everlasting contempt.” <span id="fr_1610"></span>[1611](#fn_1610)   And
in another place by the same prophet:  “The saints of the Most High
shall take the kingdom, and shall possess the kingdom for ever, even for
ever and ever.” <span id="fr_1611"></span>[1612](#fn_1611)   And a
little after he says, “His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.” <span
id="fr_1612"></span>[1613](#fn_1612)   Other prophecies referring to the
same subject I have advanced in the twentieth book, and others still
which I have not advanced are found written in the same Scriptures; and
these predictions shall be fulfilled, as those also have been which
unbelieving men supposed would be frustrate.  For it is the same God who
promised both, and predicted that both would come to pass,—the God whom
the pagan deities tremble before, as even Porphyry, the noblest of pagan
philosophers, testifies.
