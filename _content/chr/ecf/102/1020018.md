<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—Of the Burial of the Dead:  that
the Denial of It to Christians Does Them No Injury. <span
id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60) </span>

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p3"></span>Further still, we are reminded that in
such a carnage as then occurred, the bodies could not even be buried. 
But godly confidence is not appalled by so ill-omened a circumstance;
for the faithful bear in mind that assurance has been given that not a
hair of their head shall perish, and that, therefore, though they even
be devoured by beasts, their blessed resurrection will not hereby be
hindered.  The Truth would nowise have said, “Fear not them which kill
the body, but are not able to kill the soul,” <span
id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61) if anything whatever that an enemy could
do to the body of the slain could be detrimental to the future life.  Or
will some one perhaps take so absurd a position as to contend that those
who kill the body are not to be feared before death, and lest they kill
the body, but after death, lest they deprive it of burial?  If this be
so, then that is false which Christ says, “Be not afraid of them that
kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do;” <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62) for it seems they can do great injury to
the dead body.  Far be it from us to suppose that the Truth can be thus
false.  They who kill the body are said “to do something,” because the
deathblow is felt, the body still having sensation; but after that, they
have no more that they can do, for in the slain body there is no
sensation.  And so there are indeed many bodies of Christians lying
unburied; but no one has separated them from heaven, nor from that earth
which is all filled with the presence of Him who knows whence He will
raise again what He created.  It is said, indeed, in the Psalm:  “The
dead bodies of Thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of
the heaven, the flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.  Their
blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was
none to bury them.” <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63)   But this was
said rather to exhibit the cruelty of those who did these things, than
the misery of those who suffered them.  To the eyes of men this appears
a harsh and doleful lot, yet “precious in the sight of the Lord is the
death of His saints.” <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64)   Wherefore
all these last offices and ceremonies that concern the dead, the careful
funeral arrangements, and the equipment of the tomb, and the pomp of
obsequies, are rather the solace of the living than the comfort of the
dead.  If a costly burial does any good to a wicked man, a squalid
burial, or none at all, may harm the godly.  His crowd of domestics
furnished the purple-clad Dives with a funeral gorgeous in the eye of
man; but in the sight of God that was a more sumptuous funeral which the
ulcerous pauper received at the hands of the angels, who did not carry
him out to a marble tomb, but bore him aloft to Abraham’s bosom.

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p8"></span>The men against whom I have undertaken
to defend the city of God laugh at all this.  But even their own
philosophers <span id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65) have despised a
careful burial; and often whole armies have fought and fallen for their
earthly country without caring to inquire whether they <span
id="page_10">p. 10</span> <span id="iv.ii.xiii-Page_10"></span> would be
left exposed on the field of battle, or become the food of wild beasts. 
Of this noble disregard of sepulture poetry has well said:  “He who has
no tomb has the sky for his vault.” <span id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66)
  How much less ought they to insult over the unburied bodies of
Christians, to whom it has been promised that the flesh itself shall be
restored, and the body formed anew, all the members of it being gathered
not only from the earth, but from the most secret recesses of any other
of the elements in which the dead bodies of men have lain hid!
