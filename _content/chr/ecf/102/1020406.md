<span id="iv.XIV.14-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIV.14-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Of the Pride in the Sin, Which
Was Worse Than the Sin Itself.</span>

<span id="iv.XIV.14-p2"></span>But it is a worse and more damnable pride
which casts about for the shelter of an excuse even in manifest sins, as
these our first parents did, of whom the woman said, “The serpent
beguiled me, and I did eat;” and the man said, “The woman whom Thou
gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.” <span
id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736)   Here there is no word of begging
pardon, no word of entreaty for healing.  For though they do not, like
Cain, deny that they have perpetrated the deed, yet their pride seeks to
refer its wickedness to another,—the woman’s pride to the serpent, the
man’s to the woman.  But where there is a plain trangression of a divine
commandment, this is rather to accuse than to excuse oneself.  For the
fact that the woman sinned on the serpent’s persuasion, and the man at
the woman’s offer, did not make the transgression less, as if there were
any one whom we ought rather to believe or yield to than God.
