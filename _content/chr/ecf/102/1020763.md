id="v.v.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—What Human Contrivances We are to
Adopt, and What We are to Avoid.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxvi-p2"></span>For certain institutions of men are in a
sort of way representations and likenesses of natural objects.  And of
these, such as have relation to fellowship with devils must, as has been
said, be utterly rejected and held in detestation; those, on the other
hand, which relate to the mutual intercourse of men, are, so far as they
are not matters of luxury and superfluity, to be adopted, especially the
forms of the letters which are necessary for reading, and the various
languages as far as is required—a matter I have spoken of above. <span
id="fr_1811"></span>[1812](#fn_1811)   To this class also belong
shorthand characters, <span id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812) those
who are acquainted with which are called shorthand writers. <span
id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813)   All these are useful, and there
is nothing unlawful in learning them, nor do they involve us in
superstition, or enervate us by luxury, if they only occupy our minds so
far as not to stand in the way of more important objects to which they
ought to be subservient.
