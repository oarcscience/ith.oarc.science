id="iv.IX.6-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Of the Passions Which, According to
Apuleius, Agitate the Demons Who Are Supposed by Him to Mediate Between
Gods and Men.</span>

<span id="iv.IX.6-p2"></span>Deferring for the present the question
about the holy angels, let us examine the opinion of the Platonists,
that the demons who mediate between gods and men are agitated by
passions.  For if their mind, though exposed to their incursion, still
remained free and superior to them, Apuleius could not have said that
their hearts are tossed with passions as the sea by stormy winds. <span
id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343)   Their mind, then,—that superior part
of their soul whereby they are rational beings, and which, if it
actually exists in them, should rule and bridle the turbulent passions
of the inferior parts of the soul,—this mind of theirs, I say, is,
according to the Platonist referred to, tossed with a hurricane of
passions.  The mind of the demons, therefore, is subject to the emotions
of fear, anger, lust, and all similar affections.  What part of them,
then, is free, and endued with wisdom, so that they are pleasing to the
gods, and the fit guides of men into purity of life, since their very
highest part, being the slave of passion and subject to vice, only makes
them more intent on deceiving and seducing, in proportion to the mental
force and energy of desire they possess?
