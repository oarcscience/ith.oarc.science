<span id="iv.XIX.22-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIX.22-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—Whether the God Whom the
Christians Serve is the True God to Whom Alone Sacrifice Ought to Be
Paid.</span>

<span id="iv.XIX.22-p2"></span>But it may be replied, Who is this God,
or what proof is there that He alone is worthy to receive sacrifice from
the Romans?  One must be very blind to be still asking who this God is. 
He is the God whose prophets predicted the things we see accomplished. 
He is the God from whom Abraham received the assurance, “In thy seed
shall all nations be blessed.” <span
id="fr_1297"></span>[1298](#fn_1297)   That this was fulfilled in
Christ, who according to the flesh sprang from that seed, is recognized,
whether they will or no, even by those who have continued to be the
enemies of this name.  He is the God whose divine Spirit spake by the
men whose predictions I cited in the preceding books, and which are
fulfilled in the Church which has extended over all the world.  This is
the God whom Varro, the most learned of the Romans, supposed to be
Jupiter, though he knows not what he says; yet I think it right to note
the circumstance that a man of such learning was unable to suppose that
this God had no existence or was contemptible, but believed Him to be
the same as the supreme God.  In fine, He is the God whom Porphyry, the
most learned of the philosophers, though the bitterest enemy of the
Christians, confesses to be a great God, even according to the oracles
of those whom he esteems gods.
