<span id="iv.XI.18-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XI.18-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—Of the Beauty of the Universe,
Which Becomes, by God’s Ordinance, More Brilliant by the Opposition of
Contraries.</span>

<span id="iv.XI.18-p2"></span>For God would never have created any, I do
not say angel, but even man, whose future wickedness He foreknew, unless
He had equally known to what uses in behalf of the <span
id="page_215">p. 215</span> <span id="iv.XI.18-Page_215"></span> good He
could turn him, thus embellishing, the course of the ages, as it were an
exquisite poem set off with antitheses.  For what are called antitheses
are among the most elegant of the ornaments of speech.  They might be
called in Latin “oppositions,” or, to speak more accurately,
“contrapositions;” but this word is not in common use among us, <span
id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487) though the Latin, and indeed the
languages of all nations, avail themselves of the same ornaments of
style.  In the Second Epistle to the Corinthians the Apostle Paul also
makes a graceful use of antithesis, in that place where he says, “By the
armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor and
dishonor, by evil report and good report:  as deceivers, and yet true;
as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as
chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor,
yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all
things.” <span id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488)   As, then, these
oppositions of contraries lend beauty to the language, so the beauty of
the course of this world is achieved by the opposition of contraries,
arranged, as it were, by an eloquence not of words, but of things.  This
is quite plainly stated in the Book of Ecclesiasticus, in this way: 
“Good is set against evil, and life against death:  so is the sinner
against the godly.  So look upon all the works of the Most High, and
these are two and two, one against another.” <span
