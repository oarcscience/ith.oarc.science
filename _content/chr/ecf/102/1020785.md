id="v.vi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—It is a Wretched Slavery Which Takes
the Figurative Expressions of Scripture in a Literal Sense.</span>

<span id="v.vi.v-p2"></span>9.  But the ambiguities of metaphorical
words, about which I am next to speak, demand no ordinary care and
diligence.  In the first place, we must beware of taking a figurative
expression literally.  For the saying of the apostle applies in this
case too:  “The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.” <span
id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853)   For when what is said
figuratively is taken as if it were said literally, it is understood in
a carnal manner.  And nothing is more fittingly called the death of the
soul than when that in it which raises it above the brutes, the
intelligence namely, is put in subjection to the flesh by a blind
adherence to the letter.  For he who follows the letter takes figurative
words as if they were proper, and does not carry out what is indicated
by a proper word into its secondary signification; but, if he hears of
the Sabbath, for example, thinks of nothing but the one day out of seven
which recurs in constant succession; and when he hears of a sacrifice,
does not carry his thoughts beyond the customary offerings of victims
from the flock, and of the fruits of the earth.  Now it is surely a
miserable slavery of the soul to take signs for things, and to be unable
to lift the eye of the mind above what is corporeal and created, that it
may drink in eternal light.
