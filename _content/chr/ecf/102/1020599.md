id="iv.XIX.26-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—Of the Peace Which is Enjoyed by
the People that are Alienated from God, and the Use Made of It by the
People of God in the Time of Its Pilgrimage.</span>

<span id="iv.XIX.26-p2"></span>Wherefore, as the life of the flesh is
the soul, so the blessed life of man is God, of whom the sacred writings
of the Hebrews say, “Blessed is the people whose God is the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302)   Miserable, therefore, is the
people which is alienated from God.  Yet even this people has a peace of
its own which is not to be lightly esteemed, though, indeed, it shall
not in the end enjoy it, because it makes no good use of it before the
end.  But it is our interest that it enjoy this peace meanwhile in this
life; for as long as the two cities are commingled, we also enjoy the
peace of Babylon.  For from Babylon the people of God is so freed that
it meanwhile sojourns in its company.  And therefore the apostle also
admonished the Church to pray for kings and those in authority,
assigning as the reason, “that we may live a quiet and tranquil life in
all godliness and love.” <span id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303)  
And the prophet Jeremiah, when predicting the captivity that was to
befall the ancient people of God, and giving them the divine command to
go obediently to Babylonia, and thus serve their God, counselled them
also to pray for Babylonia, saying, “In the peace thereof shall ye have
peace,” <span id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304) —the temporal peace
which the good and the wicked together enjoy.
