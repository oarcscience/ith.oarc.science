<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XI.14-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XI.14-p1.1"></A>Chapter 14.&#8212;An Explanation of What is Said of the Devil, that He Did Not Abide in the Truth, Because the Truth Was Not in Him.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XI.14-p2"></A>Moreover, as if we had been inquiring why the devil did not abide in the truth, our Lord subjoins the reason, saying, &#8220;because the truth is not in him.&#8221;&#160; Now, it would be in him had he abode in it.&#160; But the phraseology is unusual.&#160; For, as the words stand, &#8220;He abode not in the truth, because the truth is not in him,&#8221; it seems as if the truth&#146;s not being in him were the cause of his not abiding in it; whereas his not abiding in the truth is rather the cause of its not being in him.&#160; The same form of speech is found in the psalm:&#160; &#8220;I have called upon Thee, for Thou hast heard me, O God,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_477"></A><A HREF="#fn_477"><FONT SIZE="1">478</FONT></A>
 where we should expect it to be said, Thou hast heard me, O God, for I have called upon Thee.&#160; But when he had said, &#8220;I have called,&#8221; then, as if some one were seeking proof of this, he demonstrates the effectual earnestness of his prayer by the effect of God&#146;s hearing it; as if he had said, The proof that I have prayed is that Thou hast heard me.</p>
