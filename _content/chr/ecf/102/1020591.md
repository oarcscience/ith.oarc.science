id="iv.XIX.18-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—How Different the Uncertainty of
the New Academy is from the Certainty of the Christian Faith.</span>

<span id="iv.XIX.18-p2"></span>As regards the uncertainty about
everything which Varro alleges to be the differentiating characteristic
of the New Academy, the city of God thoroughly detests such doubt as
madness.  Regarding matters which it apprehends by the mind and reason
it has most absolute certainty, although its knowledge is limited
because of the corruptible body pressing down the mind, for, as the
apostle says, “We know in part.” <span
id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289)   It believes also the evidence of
the senses which the mind uses by aid of the body; for \[if one who
trusts his senses is sometimes deceived\], he is more wretchedly
deceived who fancies he should never trust them.  It believes also the
Holy Scriptures, old and new, which we call canonical, and which are the
source of the faith by which the just lives <span
id="fr_1290"></span>[1291](#fn_1290) and by which we walk without
doubting whilst we are absent from the Lord. <span
id="fr_1291"></span>[1292](#fn_1291)   So long as this faith remains
inviolate and firm, we may without blame entertain doubts regarding some
things which we have neither perceived by sense nor by reason, and which
have not been revealed to us by the canonical Scriptures, nor come to
our knowledge through witnesses whom it is absurd to disbelieve.
