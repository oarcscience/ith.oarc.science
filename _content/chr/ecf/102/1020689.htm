<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XXII.28-p2"></A>Some Christians, who have a liking for Plato on account of his magnificent style and the truths which he now and then uttered, say that he even held an opinion similar to our own regarding the resurrection of the dead.&#160; Cicero, however, alluding to this in his <i>Republic</i>, asserts that Plato meant it rather as a playful fancy than as a reality; for he introduces a man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1667"></A><A HREF="#fn_1667"><FONT SIZE="1">1668</FONT></A>
 who had come to life again, and gave a narrative of his experience in corroboration of the doctrines of Plato.&#160; Labeo, too, says that two men died on one day, and met at a cross-road, and that, being afterwards ordered to return to their bodies, they agreed to be friends for life, and were so till they died again.&#160; But the resurrection which these writers instance resembles that of those persons whom we have ourselves known to rise again, and who came back indeed to this life, but not so as never to die again.&#160; Marcus Varro, however, in his work <i>On the Origin of the Roman People</i>, records something more remarkable; I think his own words should be given.&#160; &#8220;Certain astrologers,&#8221; he says, &#8220;have written that men are destined to a new birth, which the Greeks call <i> palingenesy</i>.&#160; This will take place after four hundred and forty years have elapsed; and then the same soul and the same body, which were formerly united in the person, shall again be reunited.&#8221;&#160; This Varro, indeed, or those nameless astrologers,&#8212;for he does not give us the names of the men whose statement he cites,&#8212;have affirmed what is indeed not altogether true; for once the souls have returned to the bodies they wore, they shall never afterwards leave them.&#160; Yet what they say upsets and demolishes much of that idle talk of our adversaries about the impossibility of the resurrection.  <A NAME="page_507"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 507</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XXII.28-Page_507"></A>  For those who have been or are of this opinion, have not thought it possible that bodies which have dissolved into air, or dust, or ashes, or water, or into the bodies of the beasts or even of the men that fed on them, should be restored again to that which they formerly were.&#160; And therefore, if Plato and Porphyry, or rather, if their disciples now living, agree with us that holy souls shall return to the body, as Plato says, and that, nevertheless, they shall not return to misery, as Porphyry maintains, &#8212;if they accept the consequence of these two propositions which is taught by the Christian faith, that they shall receive bodies in which they may live eternally without suffering any misery,&#8212;let them also adopt from Varro the opinion that they shall return to the same bodies as they were formerly in, and thus the whole question of the eternal resurrection of the body shall be resolved out of their own mouths.</p>
