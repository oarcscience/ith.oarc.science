id="iv.X.13-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—Of the Invisible God, Who Has Often
Made Himself Visible, Not as He Really Is, But as the Beholders Could
Bear the Sight.</span>

<span id="iv.X.13-p2"></span>Neither need we be surprised that God,
invisible as He is, should often have appeared visibly to the
patriarchs.  For as the sound which communicates the thought conceived
in the silence of the mind is not the thought itself, so the form by
which God, invisible in His own nature, became visible, was not God
Himself.  Nevertheless it is He Himself who was seen under that form, as
that thought itself is heard in the sound of the voice; and the
patriarchs recognized that, though the bodily form was not God, they saw
the invisible God.  For, though Moses conversed with God, yet he said,
“If I have found grace in Thy sight, show me Thyself, that I may see and
know Thee.” <span id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405)   And as it was fit
that the law, which was given, not to one man or a few enlightened men,
but to the whole of a populous nation, should be accompanied by
awe-inspiring signs, great marvels were wrought, by the ministry of
angels, before the people on the mount where the law was being given to
them through one man, while the multitude beheld the awful appearances. 
For the people of Israel believed Moses, not as the Lacedæmonians
believed their Lycurgus, because he had received from Jupiter or Apollo
the laws he gave them.  For when the law which enjoined the worship of
one God was given to the people, marvellous signs and earthquakes, such
as the divine wisdom judged sufficient, were brought about in the sight
of all, that they might know that it was the Creator who could thus use
creation to promulgate His law.
