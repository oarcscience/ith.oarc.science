<p class="c34"><a name="iv.IX.10-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.IX.10-p1.1"></A>Chapter 10.&#8212;That, According to Plotinus, Men, Whose Body is Mortal, are Less Wretched Than Demons, Whose Body is Eternal.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.IX.10-p2"></A>Plotinus, whose memory is quite recent,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_347"></A><A HREF="#fn_347"><FONT SIZE="1">348</FONT></A>
 enjoys the reputation of having understood Plato better than any other of his disciples.&#160; In speaking of human souls, he says, &#8220;The Father in compassion made their bonds mortal;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_348"></A><A HREF="#fn_348"><FONT SIZE="1">349</FONT></A>
 that is to say, he considered it due to the Father&#146;s mercy that men, having a mortal body, should not be forever confined in the misery of this life.&#160; But of this mercy the demons have been judged unworthy, and they have received, in conjunction with a soul subject to passions, a body not mortal like man&#146;s, but eternal.&#160; For they should have been happier than men if they had, like men, had a mortal body, and, like the gods, a blessed soul.&#160; And they should have been equal to men, if in conjunction with a miserable soul they had at least received, like men, a mortal body, so that death might have freed them from trouble, if, at least, they should have attained some degree of piety.&#160; But, as it is, they are not only no happier than men, having, like them, a miserable soul, they are also more wretched, being eternally bound to the body; for he does not leave us to infer that by some progress in wisdom and piety they can become gods, but expressly says that they are demons forever.</p>
