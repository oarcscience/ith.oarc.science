<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVI.18-p2"></A>Abraham, then, having departed out of Haran in the seventy-fifth year of his own age, and in the hundred and forty-fifth of his father&#146;s, went with Lot, his brother&#146;s son, and Sarah his wife, into the land of Canaan, and came even to Sichem, where again he received the divine oracle, of which it is thus written:&#160; &#8220;And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said unto him, Unto thy seed will I give this land.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_903"></A><A HREF="#fn_903"><FONT SIZE="1">904</FONT></A>
