<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—Reasons for Burying the Bodies of
the Saints.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p2"></span>Nevertheless the bodies of the dead are
not on this account to be despised and left unburied; least of all the
bodies of the righteous and faithful, which have been used by the Holy
Spirit as His organs and instruments for all good works.  For if the
dress of a father, or his ring, or anything he wore, be precious to his
children, in proportion to the love they bore him, with how much more
reason ought we to care for the bodies of those we love, which they wore
far more closely and intimately than any clothing!  For the body is not
an extraneous ornament or aid, but a part of man’s very nature.  And
therefore to the righteous of ancient times the last offices were
piously rendered, and sepulchres provided for them, and obsequies
celebrated; <span id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67) and they themselves,
while yet alive, gave commandment to their sons about the burial, and,
on occasion, even about the removal of their bodies to some favorite
place. <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68)   And Tobit, according to
the angel’s testimony, is commended, and is said to have pleased God by
burying the dead. <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69)   Our Lord
Himself, too, though He was to rise again the third day, applauds, and
commends to our applause, the good work of the religious woman who
poured precious ointment over His limbs, and did it against His
burial. <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70)   And the Gospel speaks
with commendation of those who were careful to take down His body from
the cross, and wrap it lovingly in costly cerements, and see to its
burial. <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71)   These instances certainly
do not prove that corpses have any feeling; but they show that God’s
providence extends even to the bodies of the dead, and that such pious
offices are pleasing to Him, as cherishing faith in the resurrection. 
And we may also draw from them this wholesome lesson, that if God does
not forget even any kind office which loving care pays to the
unconscious dead, much more does He reward the charity we exercise
towards the living.  Other things, indeed, which the holy patriarchs
said of the burial and removal of their bodies, they meant to be taken
in a prophetic sense; but of these we need not here speak at large, what
we have already said being sufficient.  But if the want of those things
which are necessary for the support of the living, as food and clothing,
though painful and trying, does not break down the fortitude and
virtuous endurance of good men, nor eradicate piety from their souls,
but rather renders it more fruitful, how much less can the absence of
the funeral, and of the other customary attentions paid to the dead,
render those wretched who are already reposing in the hidden abodes of
the blessed!  Consequently, though in the sack of Rome and of other
towns the dead bodies of the Christians were deprived of these last
offices, this is neither the fault of the living, for they could not
render them; nor an infliction to the dead, for they cannot feel the
loss.
