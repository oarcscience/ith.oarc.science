<span id="iv.XVIII.38-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVIII.38-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38.—That the Ecclesiastical Canon
Has Not Admitted Certain Writings on Account of Their Too Great
Antiquity, Lest Through Them False Things Should Be Inserted Instead of
True.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.38-p2"></span>If I may recall far more ancient times,
our patriarch Noah was certainly even before that great deluge, and I
might not undeservedly call him a prophet, forasmuch as the ark he made,
in which he escaped with his family, was itself a prophecy of our
times. <span id="fr_1212"></span>[1213](#fn_1212)   What of Enoch, the
seventh from Adam?  Does not the canonical epistle of the Apostle Jude
declare that he prophesied? <span id="fr_1213"></span>[1214](#fn_1213)  
But the writings of these men could not be held as authoritative either
among the Jews or us, on account of their too great antiquity, which
made it seem needful to regard them with suspicion, lest false things
should be set forth instead of true.  For some writings which are said
be theirs are quoted by those who, according to their own humor, loosely
believe what they please.  But the purity of the canon has not admitted
these writings, not because the authority of these men who pleased God
is rejected, but because they are not believed to be theirs.  Nor ought
it to appear strange if writings for which so great antiquity is claimed
are held in suspicion, seeing that in the very history of the kings of
Judah and Israel containing their acts, which we believe to belong to
the canonical Scripture, very many things are mentioned which are not
explained there, but are said to be found in other books which the
prophets wrote, the very names of these prophets being sometimes given,
and yet they are not found in the canon which the people of God
received.  Now I confess the reason of this is hidden from me; only I
think that even those men, to whom certainly the Holy Spirit revealed
those things which ought to be held as of religious authority, might
write some things as men by historical diligence, and others as prophets
by divine inspiration; and these things were so distinct, that it was
judged that the former should be ascribed to themselves, but the latter
to God speaking through them:  and so the one pertained to the abundance
of knowledge, the other to the authority of religion.  In that authority
the canon is guarded.  So that, if any writings outside of it are now
brought forward under the name of the ancient prophets, they cannot
serve even as an aid to knowledge, because it is uncertain whether they
are genuine; and on this account they are not trusted, especially those
of them in which some things are found that are even contrary to the
truth of the canonical books, so that it is quite apparent they do not
belong to them.
