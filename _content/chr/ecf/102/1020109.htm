<p class="c34"><a name="iv.IV.4-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.IV.4-p1.1"></A>Chapter 4.&#8212;How Like Kingdoms Without Justice are to Robberies.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.IV.4-p2"></A>Justice being taken away, then, what are kingdoms but great robberies?&#160; For what are robberies themselves, but little kingdoms?&#160; The band itself is made up of men; it is ruled by the authority of a prince, it is knit together by the pact of the confederacy; the booty is divided by the law agreed on.&#160; If, by the admittance of abandoned men, this evil increases to such a degree that it holds places, fixes abodes, takes possession of cities, and subdues peoples, it assumes the more plainly the name of a kingdom, because the reality is now manifestly conferred on it, not by the removal of covetousness, but by the addition of impunity.&#160; Indeed, that was an apt and true reply which was given to Alexander the Great by a pirate who had been seized.&#160; For when that king had asked the man what he meant by keeping hostile possession of the sea, he answered with bold pride, &#8220;What thou meanest by seizing the whole earth; but because I do it with a petty ship, I am called a robber, whilst thou who dost it with a great fleet art styled emperor.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">164</FONT></A>
