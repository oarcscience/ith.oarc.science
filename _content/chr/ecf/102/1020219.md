<span id="iv.VIII-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="iv.VIII-p3"></span>Argument—Augustin comes now to the third
kind of theology, that is, the natural, and takes up the question,
whether the worship of the gods of the natural theology is of any avail
towards securing blessedness in the life to come.  This question he
prefers to discuss with the Platonists, because the Platonic system is
“facile princeps” among philosophies, and makes the nearest
approximation to Christian truth.  In pursuing this argument, he first
refutes Apuleius, and all who maintain that the demons should be
worshipped as messengers and mediators between gods and men;
demonstrating that by no possibility can men be reconciled to good gods
by demons, who are the slaves of vice, and who delight in and patronize
what good and wise men abhor and condemn,—The blasphemous fictions of
poets, theatrical exhibitions, and magical arts.
