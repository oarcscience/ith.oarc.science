<p class="c34"><a name="iv.IV.27-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.IV.27-p1.1"></A>Chapter 27.&#8212;Concerning the Three Kinds of Gods About Which the Pontiff Sc&aelig;vola Has Discoursed.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.IV.27-p2"></A>It is recorded that the very learned pontiff Sc&aelig;vola&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">179</FONT></A>
 had distinguished about three kinds of gods&#8212;one introduced by the poets, another by the philosophers, another by the statesmen.&#160; The first kind he declares to be trifling, because many unworthy things have been invented by the poets concerning the gods; the second does not suit states, because it contains some things that are superfluous, and some, too, which it would be prejudicial for the people to know.&#160; It is no great matter about the superfluous things, for it is a common saying of skillful lawyers, &#8220;Superfluous things do no harm.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_179"><FONT SIZE="1">180</FONT></A>
&#160; But what are those things which do harm when brought before the multitude?&#160; &#8220;These,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that Hercules, &AElig;sculapius, Castor and Pollux, are not gods; for it is declared by learned men that these were but men, and yielded to the common lot of mortals.&#8221;&#160; What else?&#160; &#8220;That states have not the true images of the gods; because the true God has neither sex, nor age, nor definite corporeal members.&#8221;&#160; The pontiff is not willing that the people should know these things; for he does not think they are false.&#160; He thinks it expedient, therefore, that states should be deceived in matters of religion; which Varro himself does not even hesitate to say in his books about things divine.&#160; Excellent religion! to which the weak, who requires to be delivered, may flee for succor; and when he seeks for the truth by which he may be delivered, it is believed to be expedient for him that he be deceived.&#160; And, truly, in these same books, Sc&aelig;vola is not silent as to his reason for rejecting the poetic sort of gods,&#8212;to wit, &#8220;because they so disfigure the gods that they could not bear comparison even with good men, when they make one to commit theft, another adultery; or, again, to say or do something else basely and foolishly; as that  <A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A> <a name="iv.IV.27-Page_79"></A>  three goddesses contested (with each other) the prize of beauty, and the two vanquished by Venus destroyed Troy; that Jupiter turned himself into a bull or swan that he might copulate with some one; that a goddess married a man, and Saturn devoured his children; that, in fine, there is nothing that could be imagined, either of the miraculous or vicious, which may not be found there, and yet is far removed from the nature of the gods.&#8221;&#160; O chief pontiff Sc&aelig;vola, take away the plays if thou art able; instruct the people that they may not offer such honors to the immortal gods, in which, if they like, they may admire the crimes of the gods, and, so far as it is possible, may, if they please, imitate them.&#160; But if the people shall have answered thee, You, O pontiff, have brought these things in among us, then ask the gods themselves at whose instigation you have ordered these things, that they may not order such things to be offered to them.&#160; For if they are bad, and therefore in no way to be believed concerning the majority of the gods, the greater is the wrong done the gods about whom they are feigned with impunity.&#160; But they do not hear thee, they are demons, they teach wicked things, they rejoice in vile things; not only do they not count it a wrong if these things are feigned about them, but it is a wrong they are quite unable to bear if they are not acted at their stated festivals.&#160; But now, if thou wouldst call on Jupiter against them, chiefly for that reason that more of his crimes are wont to be acted in the scenic plays, is it not the case that, although you call him god Jupiter, by whom this whole world is ruled and administered, it is he to whom the greatest wrong is done by you, because you have thought he ought to be worshipped along with them, and have styled him their king?</p>
