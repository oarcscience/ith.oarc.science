<p class="c34"><a name="iv.V.1-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.V.1-p1.1"></A>Chapter 1.&#8212;That the Cause of the Roman Empire, and of All Kingdoms, is Neither Fortuitous Nor Consists in the Position of the Stars.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_188"></A><A HREF="#fn_188"><FONT SIZE="1">189</FONT></A>
</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.V.1-p3"></A>The cause, then, of the greatness of the Roman empire is neither fortuitous nor fatal, according to the judgment or opinion of those who call those things <i> fortuitous</i> which either have no causes, or such causes as do not proceed from some intelligible order, and those things <i> fatal</i> which happen independently of the will of God and man, by the necessity of a certain <i>order</i>.&#160; In a word, human kingdoms are established by divine providence.&#160; And if any one attributes their existence to fate, because he calls the will or the power of God itself by the name of fate, let him keep his opinion, but correct his language.&#160; For why does he not say at first what he will say afterwards, when some one shall put the question to him, What he means by <i>fate</i>?&#160; For when men hear that word, according to the ordinary use of the language, they simply understand by it the virtue of that particular position of the stars which may exist at the time when any one is born or conceived, which some separate altogether from the will of God, whilst others affirm that this also is dependent on that will.&#160; But those who are of opinion that, apart from the will of God, the stars determine what we shall do, or what good things we shall possess, or what evils we shall suffer, must be refused a hearing by all, not only by those who hold the true religion, but by those who wish to be the worshippers of any gods whatsoever, even false gods.&#160; For what does this opinion really amount to but this, that no god whatever is to be worshipped or prayed  <A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A> <a name="iv.V.1-Page_85"></A>  to?&#160; Against these, however, our present disputation is not intended to be directed, but against those who, in defence of those whom they think to be gods, oppose the Christian religion.&#160; They, however, who make the position of the stars depend on the divine will, and in a manner decree what character each man shall have, and what good or evil shall happen to him, if they think that these same stars have that power conferred upon them by the supreme power of God, in order that they may determine these things according to their will, do a great injury to the celestial sphere, in whose most brilliant senate, and most splendid senate-house, as it were, they suppose that wicked deeds are decreed to be done,&#8212;such deeds as that, if any terrestrial state should decree them, it would be condemned to overthrow by the decree of the whole human race. &#160;What judgment, then, is left to God concerning the deeds of men, who is Lord both of the stars and of men, when to these deeds a celestial necessity is attributed?&#160; Or, if they do not say that the stars, though they have indeed received a certain power from God, who is supreme, determine those things according to their own discretion, but simply that His commands are fulfilled by them instrumentally in the application and enforcing of such necessities, are we thus to think concerning God even what it seemed unworthy that we should think concerning the will of the stars?&#160; But, if the stars are said rather to signify these things than to effect them, so that that <i>position of the stars</i> is, as it were, a kind of speech predicting, not causing future things,&#8212;for this has been the opinion of men of no ordinary learning,&#8212;certainly the mathematicians are not wont so to speak saying, for example, Mars in such or such a position <i> signifies</i> a homicide, but <i>makes</i> a homicide.&#160; But, nevertheless, though we grant that they do not speak as they ought, and that we ought to accept as the proper form of speech that employed by the philosophers in predicting those things which they think they discover in the position of the stars, how comes it that they have never been able to assign any cause why, in the life of twins, in their actions, in the events which befall them, in their professions, arts, honors, and other things pertaining to human life, also in their very death, there is often so great a difference, that, as far as these things are concerned, many entire strangers are more like them than they are like each other, though separated at birth by the smallest interval of time, but at conception generated by the same act of copulation, and at the same moment?</p>
