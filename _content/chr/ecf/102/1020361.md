id="iv.XII.22-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—That God Foreknew that the First
Man Would Sin, and that He at the Same Time Foresaw How Large a
Multitude of Godly Persons Would by His Grace Be Translated to the
Fellowship of the Angels.</span>

<span id="iv.XII.22-p2"></span>And God was not ignorant that man would
sin, and that, being himself made subject now to death, he would
propagate men doomed to die, and that these mortals would run to such
enormities in sin, that even the beasts devoid of rational will, and who
were created in numbers from the waters and the earth, would live more
securely and peaceably with their own kind than men, who had been
propagated from one individual for the very purpose of commending
concord.  For not even lions or dragons have ever waged with their kind
such wars as men have waged with one another. <span
id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565)   But God foresaw also that by His
grace a people would be called to adoption, and that they, being
justified by the remission of their sins, would be united by the Holy
Ghost to the holy angels in eternal peace, the last enemy, death, being
destroyed; and He knew that this people would derive profit from the
consideration that God had caused all men to be derived from one, for
the sake of showing how highly He prizes unity in a multitude.
