<p class="c34"><a name="iv.VIII.3-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.VIII.3-p1.1"></A>Chapter 3.&#8212;Of the Socratic Philosophy.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.VIII.3-p2"></A>Socrates is said to have been the first who directed the entire effort of philosophy to the correction and regulation of manners, all who went before him having expended their greatest efforts in the investigation of physical, that is, natural phenomena.&#160; However, it seems to me that it cannot be certainly discovered whether Socrates did this because he was wearied of obscure and uncertain things, and so wished to direct his mind to the discovery of something manifest and certain, which was necessary in order to the obtaining of a blessed life,&#8212;that one great object toward which the labor, vigilance, and industry of all philosophers seem to have been directed,&#8212;or whether (as some yet more favorable to  <A NAME="page_146"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 146</FONT></A> <a name="iv.VIII.3-Page_146"></A>  him suppose) he did it because he was unwilling that minds defiled with earthly desires should essay to raise themselves upward to divine things.&#160; For he saw that the causes of things were sought for by them,&#8212;which causes he believed to be ultimately reducible to nothing else than the will of the one true and supreme God,&#8212;and on this account he thought they could only be comprehended by a purified mind; and therefore that all diligence ought to be given to the purification of the life by good morals, in order that the mind, delivered from the depressing weight of lusts, might raise itself upward by its native vigor to eternal things, and might, with purified understanding, contemplate that nature which is incorporeal and unchangeable light, where live the causes of all created natures.&#160; It is evident, however, that he hunted out and pursued, with a wonderful pleasantness of style and argument, and with a most pointed and insinuating urbanity, the foolishness of ignorant men, who thought that they knew this or that,&#8212;sometimes confessing his own ignorance, and sometimes dissimulating his knowledge, even in those very moral questions to which he seems to have directed the whole force of his mind.&#160; And hence there arose hostility against him, which ended in his being calumniously impeached, and condemned to death.&#160; Afterwards, however, that very city of the Athenians, which had publicly condemned him, did publicly bewail him,&#8212;the popular indignation having turned with such vehemence on his accusers, that one of them perished by the violence of the multitude, whilst the other only escaped a like punishment by voluntary and perpetual exile.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.VIII.3-p3"></A>Illustrious, therefore, both in his life and in his death, Socrates left very many disciples of his philosophy, who vied with one another in desire for proficiency in handling those moral questions which concern the chief good (<i>summum bonum</i>), the possession of which can make a man blessed; and because, in the disputations of Socrates, where he raises all manner of questions, makes assertions, and then demolishes them, it did not evidently appear what he held to be the chief good, every one took from these disputations what pleased him best, and every one placed the final good&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_297"></A><A HREF="#fn_297"><FONT SIZE="1">298</FONT></A>
 in whatever it appeared to himself to consist.&#160; Now, that which is called the final good is that at which, when one has arrived, he is blessed.&#160; But so diverse were the opinions held by those followers of Socrates concerning this final good, that (a thing scarcely to be credited with respect to the followers of one master) some placed the chief good in pleasure, as Aristippus, others in virtue, as Antisthenes.&#160; Indeed, it were tedious to recount the various opinions of various disciples.</p>
