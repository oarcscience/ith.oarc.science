<p class="c21"><a name="iv.III.30-p2"></A>With what effrontery, then, with what assurance, with what impudence, with what folly, or rather insanity, do they refuse to impute these disasters to their own gods, and impute the present to our Christ!&#160; These bloody civil wars, more distressing, by the avowal of their own historians, than any foreign wars, and which were pronounced to be not merely calamitous, but absolutely ruinous to the republic, began long before the coming of Christ, and gave birth to one another; so that a concatenation of unjustifiable causes led from the wars of Marius and Sylla to those of Sertorius and Cataline, of whom the one was proscribed, the other brought up by Sylla; from this to the war of Lepidus and Catulus, of whom the one wished to rescind, the other to defend the acts of Sylla; from this to the war of Pompey and C&aelig;sar, of whom Pompey had been a partisan of Sylla, whose power he equalled or even surpassed, while C&aelig;sar condemned Pompey&#146;s power because it was not his own, and yet exceeded it when Pompey  <A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A> <a name="iv.III.30-Page_62"></A>  was defeated and slain.&#160; From him the chain of civil wars extended to the second C&aelig;sar, afterwards called Augustus, and in whose reign Christ was born.&#160; For even Augustus himself waged many civil wars; and in these wars many of the foremost men perished, among them that skilful manipulator of the republic, Cicero.&#160; Caius [Julius] C&aelig;sar, when he had conquered Pompey, though he used his victory with clemency, and granted to men of the opposite faction both life and honors, was suspected of aiming at royalty, and was assassinated in the curia by a party of noble senators, who had conspired to defend the liberty of the republic.&#160; His power was then coveted by Antony, a man of very different character, polluted and debased by every kind of vice, who was strenuously resisted by Cicero on the same plea of defending the liberty of the republic.&#160; At this juncture that other C&aelig;sar, the adopted son of Caius, and afterwards, as I said, known by the name of Augustus, had made his <i>d&eacute;but</i> as a young man of remarkable genius.&#160; This youthful C&aelig;sar was favored by Cicero, in order that his influence might counteract that of Antony; for he hoped that C&aelig;sar would overthrow and blast the power of Antony, and establish a free state,&#8212;so blind and unaware of the future was he:&#160; for that very young man, whose advancement and influence he was fostering, allowed Cicero to be killed as the seal of an alliance with Antony, and subjected to his own rule the very liberty of the republic in defence of which he had made so many orations.</p>
