id="iv.VII.25-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—The Interpretation of the
Mutilation of Atys Which the Doctrine of the Greek Sages Set
Forth.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.25-p2"></span>Varro has not spoken of that Atys, nor
sought out any interpretation for him, in memory of whose being loved by
Ceres the Gallus is mutilated.  But the learned and wise Greeks have by
no means been silent about an interpretation so holy and so
illustrious.  The celebrated philosopher Porphyry has said that Atys
signifies the flowers of spring, which is the most beautiful season, and
therefore was mutilated because the flower falls before the fruit
appears. <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285)   They have not, then,
compared the man himself, or rather that semblance of a man they called
Atys, to the flower, but his male organs,—these, indeed, fell whilst he
was living.  Did I say fell? nay, truly they did not fall, nor were they
plucked off, but torn away.  Nor when that flower was lost did any fruit
follow, but rather sterility.  What, then, do they say is signified by
the castrated Atys himself, and whatever remained to him after his
castration?  To what do they refer that?  What interpretation does that
give rise to?  Do they, after vain endeavors to discover an
interpretation, seek to persuade men that that is rather to be believed
which report has made public, and which has also been written concerning
his having been a mutilated man?  Our Varro has very properly opposed
this, and has been unwilling to state it; for it certainly was not
unknown to that most learned man.
