id="iv.IX.14-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Whether Men, Though Mortal, Can
Enjoy True Blessedness.</span>

<span id="iv.IX.14-p2"></span>It is a great question among men, whether
man can be mortal and blessed.  Some, taking the humbler view of his
condition, have denied that he is capable of blessedness so long as he
continues in this mortal life; others, again, have spurned this idea,
and have been bold enough to maintain that, even though mortal, men may
be blessed by attaining wisdom.  But if this be the case, why are not
these wise men constituted mediators between miserable mortals and the
blessed immortals, since they have blessedness in common with the
latter, and mortality in common with the former?  Certainly, if they are
blessed, they envy no one (for what more miserable than envy?), but seek
with all their might to help miserable mortals on to blessedness, so
that after death they may become immortal, and be associated with the
blessed and immortal angels.
