<span id="iv.XII.25-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XII.25-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—That God Alone is the Creator of
Every Kind of Creature, Whatever Its Nature or Form.</span>

<span id="iv.XII.25-p2"></span>For whereas there is one form which is
given from without to every bodily substance,—such as the form which is
constructed by potters and smiths, and that class of artists who paint
and fashion forms like the body of animals,—but another and internal
form which is not itself constructed, but, as the efficient cause,
produces not only the natural bodily forms, but even the life itself of
the living creatures, and which proceeds from the secret and hidden
choice of an intelligent and living nature,—let that first-mentioned
form be attributed to every artificer, but this latter to one only, God,
the Creator and Originator who made the world itself and the angels,
without the help of world or angels.  For the same divine and, so to
speak, creative energy, which cannot be made, but makes, and which gave
to the earth and sky their roundness,—this same divine, effective, and
creative energy gave their roundness to the eye and to the apple; and
the other natural objects which we anywhere see, received also their
form, not from without, but from the secret and profound might of the
Creator, who said, “Do not I fill heaven and earth?” <span
id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567) and whose wisdom it is that “reacheth
from one end to another mightily; and sweetly doth she order all
things.” <span id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568)  Wherefore I know not
what kind of aid the angels, themselves created first, afforded to the
Creator in making other things.  I cannot ascribe to them what perhaps
they cannot do, neither ought I to deny them such faculty as they have. 
But, by their leave, I attribute the creating and originating work which
gave being to all natures to God, to whom they themselves thankfully
ascribe their existence.  We do not call gardeners the creators of their
fruits, for we read, “Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he
that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.” <span
id="fr_569"></span>[570](#fn_569)   Nay, not even the earth itself do we
call a creator, though she seems to be the prolific mother of all things
which she aids in germinating and bursting forth from the seed, and
which she keeps rooted in her own breast; for we likewise read, “God
giveth it a body, as it hath pleased Him, and to every seed his own
body.” <span id="fr_570"></span>[571](#fn_570)   We ought not even to
call a woman the creatress of her own offspring; for He rather is its
creator who said to His servant, “Before I formed thee in the womb, I
knew thee.” <span id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571)   And although the
various mental emotions of a pregnant woman do produce in <span
id="page_243">p. 243</span> <span id="iv.XII.25-Page_243"></span> the
fruit of her womb similar qualities,—as Jacob with his peeled wands
caused piebald sheep to be produced,—yet the mother as little creates
her offspring as she created herself.  Whatever bodily or seminal
causes, then, may be used for the production of things, either by the
cooperation of angels, men, or the lower animals, or by sexual
generation; and whatever power the desires and mental emotions of the
mother have to produce in the tender and plastic fœtus corresponding
lineaments and colors; yet the natures themselves, which are thus
variously affected, are the production of none but the most high God. 
It is His occult power which pervades all things, and is present in all
without being contaminated, which gives being to all that is, and
modifies and limits its existence; so that without Him it would not be
thus, or thus, nor would have any being at all. <span
id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572)   If, then, in regard to that outward
form which the workman’s hand imposes on his work, we do not say that
Rome and Alexandria were built by masons and architects, but by the
kings by whose will, plan, and resources they were built, so that the
one has Romulus, the other Alexander, for its founder; with how much
greater reason ought we to say that God alone is the Author of all
natures, since He neither uses for His work any material which was not
made by Him, nor any workmen who were not also made by Him, and since,
if He were, so to speak, to withdraw from created things His creative
power, they would straightway relapse into the nothingness in which they
were before they were created?  “Before,” I mean, in respect of
eternity, not of time.  For what other creator could there be of time,
than He who created those things whose movements make time? <span
