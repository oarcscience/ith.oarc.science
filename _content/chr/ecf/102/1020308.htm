<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XI.4-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XI.4-p1.1"></A>Chapter 4.&#8212;That the World is Neither Without Beginning, Nor Yet Created by a New Decree of God, by Which He Afterwards Willed What He Had Not Before Willed.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XI.4-p2"></A>Of all visible things, the world is the greatest; of all invisible, the greatest is God.&#160; But, that the world is, we see; that God is, we believe.&#160; That God made the world, we can believe from no one more safely than from God Himself.&#160; But where have we heard Him?&#160; Nowhere more distinctly than in the Holy Scriptures, where His prophet said, &#8220;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_452"></A><A HREF="#fn_452"><FONT SIZE="1">453</FONT></A>
&#160; Was the prophet present when God made the heavens and the earth?&#160; No; but the wisdom of God, by whom all things were made, was there,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_453"></A><A HREF="#fn_453"><FONT SIZE="1">454</FONT></A>
 and wisdom insinuates itself into holy souls, and makes them the friends of God and His prophets, and noiselessly informs them of His works.&#160; They are taught also by the angels of God, who always behold the face of the Father,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_454"></A><A HREF="#fn_454"><FONT SIZE="1">455</FONT></A>
 and announce His will to whom it befits.&#160; Of these prophets was he who said and wrote, &#8220;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&#8221;&#160; And so fit a witness was he  <A NAME="page_207"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 207</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XI.4-Page_207"></A>  of God, that the same Spirit of God, who revealed these things to him, enabled him also so long before to predict that our faith also would be forthcoming.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XI.4-p6"></A>But why did God choose then to create the heavens and earth which up to that time He had not made?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_455"></A><A HREF="#fn_455"><FONT SIZE="1">456</FONT></A>
&#160; If they who put this question wish to make out that the world is eternal and without beginning, and that consequently it has not been made by God, they are strangely deceived, and rave in the incurable madness of impiety.&#160; For, though the voices of the prophets were silent, the world itself, by its well-ordered changes and movements, and by the fair appearance of all visible things, bears a testimony of its own, both that it has been created, and also that it could not have been created save by God, whose greatness and beauty are unutterable and invisible.&#160; As for those&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_456"></A><A HREF="#fn_456"><FONT SIZE="1">457</FONT></A>
 who own, indeed, that it was made by God, and yet ascribe to it not a temporal but only a creational beginning, so that in some scarcely intelligible way the world should always have existed a created world they make an assertion which seems to them to defend God from the charge of arbitrary hastiness, or of suddenly conceiving the idea of creating the world as a quite new idea, or of casually changing His will, though He be unchangeable.&#160; But I do not see how this supposition of theirs can stand in other respects, and chiefly in respect of the soul; for if they contend that it is co-eternal with God, they will be quite at a loss to explain whence there has accrued to it new misery, which through a previous eternity had not existed.&#160; For if they said that its happiness and misery ceaselessly alternate, they must say, further, that this alternation will continue for ever; whence will result this absurdity, that, though the soul is called blessed, it is not so in this, that it foresees its own misery and disgrace.&#160; And yet, if it does not foresee it, and supposes that it will be neither disgraced nor wretched, but always blessed, then it is blessed because it is deceived; and a more foolish statement one cannot make.&#160; But if their idea is that the soul&#146;s misery has alternated with its bliss during the ages of the past eternity, but that now, when once the soul has been set free, it will return henceforth no more to misery, they are nevertheless of opinion that it has never been truly blessed before, but begins at last to enjoy a new and uncertain happiness; that is to say, they must acknowledge that some new thing, and that an important and signal thing, happens to the soul which never in a whole past eternity happened it before.&#160; And if they deny that God&#146;s eternal purpose included this new experience of the soul, they deny that He is the Author of its blessedness, which is unspeakable impiety.&#160; If, on the other hand, they say that the future blessedness of the soul is the result of a new decree of God, how will they show that God is not chargeable with that mutability which displeases them?&#160; Further, if they acknowledge that it was created in time, but will never perish in time,&#8212;that it has, like number,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_457"></A><A HREF="#fn_457"><FONT SIZE="1">458</FONT></A>
 a beginning but no end,&#8212;and that, therefore, having once made trial of misery, and been delivered from it, it will never again return thereto, they will certainly admit that this takes place without any violation of the immutable counsel of God.&#160; Let them, then, in like manner believe regarding the world that it too could be made in time, and yet that God, in making it, did not alter His eternal design.</p>
