<span id="v.iv.xii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—In What Sense the Wisdom of God
Came to Us.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xii-p2"></span>And though He is everywhere present to the
inner eye when it is sound and clear, He condescended to make Himself
manifest to the outward eye of those whose inward sight is weak and
dim.  “For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew
not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them
that believe.” <span id="fr_1724"></span>[1725](#fn_1724)

<span id="v.iv.xii-p4"></span>12.  Not then in the sense of traversing
space, but because He appeared to mortal men in the form of mortal
flesh, He is said to have come to us.  For He came to a place where He
had always been, seeing that “He was in the world, and the world was
made by Him.”  But, because men, who in their eagerness to enjoy the
creature instead of the Creator had grown into the likeness of this
world, and are therefore most appropriately named “the world,” did not
recognize Him, therefore the evangelist says, “and the world knew Him
not.” <span id="fr_1725"></span>[1726](#fn_1725)   Thus, in the wisdom
of God, the world by wisdom knew not God.  Why then did He come, seeing
that He was already here, except that it pleased God through the
foolishness of preaching to save them that believe?
