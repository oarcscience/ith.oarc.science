id="iv.II_1.3-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—That We Need Only to Read History
in Order to See What Calamities the Romans Suffered Before the Religion
of Christ Began to Compete with the Worship of the Gods.</span>

<span id="iv.II_1.3-p2"></span>But remember that, in recounting these
things, I have still to address myself to ignorant men; so ignorant,
indeed, as to give birth to the common saying, “Drought and Christianity
go hand in hand.” <span id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87)   There are
indeed some among them who are thoroughly well-educated men, and have a
taste for history, in which the things I speak of are open to their
observation; but in order to irritate the uneducated masses against us,
they feign ignorance of these events, and do what they can to make the
vulgar believe that those disasters, which in certain places and at
certain times uniformly befall mankind, are the result of Christianity,
which is being everywhere diffused, and is possessed of a renown and
brilliancy which quite eclipse their own gods. <span
id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88)   Let them then, along with us, call to
mind with what various and repeated disasters the prosperity of Rome was
blighted, before ever Christ had come in the flesh, and before His name
had been blazoned among the nations with that glory which they vainly
grudge.  Let them, if they can, defend their gods in this article, since
they maintain that they worship them in order to be preserved from these
disasters, which they now impute to us if they suffer in the least
degree.  For why did these gods permit the disasters I am to speak of to
fall on their worshippers before the preaching of Christ’s name offended
them, and put an end to their sacrifices?

<span id="iv.II_1.3-p3"></span> *Pluvia defit, causa Christiani.* 
Similar accusations and similar replies may be seen in the celebrated
passage of Tertullian’s *Apol.* c. 40, and in the eloquent exordium of
Arnobius, *C. Gentes*.

<span id="iv.II_1.3-p4"></span> Augustin is supposed to refer to
Symmachus, who similarly accused the Christians in his address to the
Emperor Valentinianus in the year 384.  At Augustin’s request, Paulus
Orosius wrote his history in confutation of Symmachus’ charges.
