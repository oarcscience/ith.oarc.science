id="iv.XVIII.11-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—When Moses Led the People Out
of Egypt; And Who Were Kings When His Successor Joshua the Son of Nun
Died.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.11-p2"></span>Moses led the people out of Egypt in
the last time of Cecrops king of Athens, when Ascatades reigned in
Assyria, Marathus in Sicyon, Triopas in Argos; and having led forth the
people, he gave them at Mount Sinai the law he received from God, which
is called the Old Testament, because it has earthly promises, and
because, through Jesus Christ, there was to be a New Testament, in which
the kingdom of heaven should be promised.  For the same order behoved to
be observed in this as is observed in each man who prospers in God,
according to the saying of the apostle, “That is not first which is
spiritual, but that which is natural,” since, as he says, and that
truly, “The first man of the earth, is earthly; the second man, from
heaven, is heavenly.” <span id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137)   Now
Moses ruled the people for forty years in the wilderness, and died a
hundred and twenty years old, after he had prophesied of Christ by the
types of carnal observances in the tabernacle, priesthood, and
sacrifices, and many other mystic ordinances.  Joshua the son of Nun
succeeded Moses, and settled in the land of promise the people he had
brought in, having by divine authority conquered the people by whom it
was formerly possessed.  He also died, after ruling the people
twenty-seven years after the death of Moses, when Amyntas reigned in
Assyria as the eighteenth king, Coracos as the sixteenth in Sicyon,
Danaos as the tenth in Argos, Ericthonius as the fourth in Athens.
