<span id="iv.VIII.11-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VIII.11-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—How Plato Has Been Able to
Approach So Nearly to Christian Knowledge.</span>

<span id="iv.VIII.11-p2"></span>Certain partakers with us in the grace
of Christ, wonder when they hear and read that Plato had conceptions
concerning God, in which they recognize considerable agreement with the
truth of our religion.  Some have concluded from this, that when he went
to Egypt he had heard the prophet Jeremiah, or, whilst travelling in the
same country, had read the prophetic scriptures, which opinion I myself
have expressed in certain of my writings. <span
id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305)   But a careful calculation of dates,
contained in chronological history, shows that Plato was born about a
hundred years after the time in which Jeremiah prophesied, and, as he
lived eighty-one years, there are found to have been about seventy years
from his death to that time when Ptolemy, king of Egypt, requested the
prophetic scriptures of the Hebrew people to be sent to him from Judea,
and committed them to seventy Hebrews, who also knew the Greek tongue,
to be translated and kept.  Therefore, on that voyage of his, Plato
could neither have seen Jeremiah, who was dead so long before, nor have
read those same scriptures which had not yet been translated into the
Greek language, of which he was a master, unless, indeed, we say that,
as he was most earnest in the pursuit of knowledge, he also studied
those writings through an interpreter, as he did those of the
Egyptians,—not, indeed, writing a translation of them (the facilities
for doing which were only gained even by Ptolemy in return for
munificent acts of kindness, <span id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306)
though fear of his kingly authority might have seemed a sufficient
motive), but learning as much as he possibly could concerning their
contents by means of conversation.  What warrants this supposition are
the <span id="page_152">p. 152</span> <span
id="iv.VIII.11-Page_152"></span> opening verses of Genesis:  “In the
beginning God made the heaven and earth.  And the earth was invisible,
and without order; and darkness was over the abyss:  and the Spirit of
God moved over the waters.” <span id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307)  
For in the *Timæus*, when writing on the formation of the world, he says
that God first united earth and fire; from which it is evident that he
assigns to fire a place in heaven.  This opinion bears a certain
resemblance to the statement, “In the beginning God made heaven and
earth.”  Plato next speaks of those two intermediary elements, water and
air, by which the other two extremes, namely, earth and fire, were
mutually united; from which circumstance he is thought to have so
understood the words, “The Spirit of God moved over the waters.”  For,
not paying sufficient attention to the designations given by those
scriptures to the Spirit of God, he may have thought that the four
elements are spoken of in that place, because the air also is called
spirit. <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308)   Then, as to Plato’s
saying that the philosopher is a lover of God, nothing shines forth more
conspicuously in those sacred writings.  But the most striking thing in
this connection, and that which most of all inclines me almost to assent
to the opinion that Plato was not ignorant of those writings, is the
answer which was given to the question elicited from the holy Moses when
the words of God were conveyed to him by the angel; for, when he asked
what was the name of that God who was commanding him to go and deliver
the Hebrew people out of Egypt, this answer was given:  “I am who am;
and thou shalt say to the children of Israel, He who *is* sent me unto
you;” <span id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309) as though compared with
Him that truly *is*, because He is unchangeable, those things which have
been created mutable *are* not,—a truth which Plato zealously held, and
most diligently commended.  And I know not whether this sentiment is
anywhere to be found in the books of those who were before Plato, unless
in that book where it is said, “I am who am; and thou shalt say to the
children of Israel, *who is* sent me unto you.”
