<p class="c34"><a name="iv.VIII.12-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.VIII.12-p1.1"></A>Chapter 12.&#8212;That Even the Platonists, Though They Say These Things Concerning the One True God, Nevertheless Thought that Sacred Rites Were to Be Performed in Honor of Many Gods.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.VIII.12-p2"></A>But we need not determine from what source he learned these things,&#8212;whether it was from the books of the ancients who preceded him, or, as is more likely, from the words of the apostle:&#160; &#8220;Because that which is known of God, has been manifested among them, for God hath manifested it to them.&#160; For His invisible things from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by those things which have been made, also His eternal power and Godhead.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_310"></A><A HREF="#fn_310"><FONT SIZE="1">311</FONT></A>
&#160; From whatever source he may have derived this knowledge, then, I think I have made it sufficiently plain that I have not chosen the Platonic philosophers undeservedly as the parties with whom to discuss; because the question we have just taken up concerns the natural theology,&#8212;the question, namely, whether sacred rites are to be performed to one God, or to many, for the sake of the happiness which is to be after death.&#160; I have specially chosen them because their juster thoughts concerning the one God who made heaven and earth, have made them illustrious among philosophers.&#160; This has given them such superiority to all others in the judgment of posterity, that, though Aristotle, the disciple of Plato, a man of eminent abilities, inferior in eloquence to Plato, yet far superior to many in that respect, had founded the Peripatetic sect,&#8212;so called because they were in the habit of walking about during their disputations,&#8212;and though he had, through the greatness of his fame, gathered very many disciples into his school, even during the life of his master; and though Plato at his death was succeeded in his school, which was called the Academy, by Speusippus, his sister&#146;s son, and Xenocrates, his beloved disciple, who, together with their successors, were called from this name of the school, Academics; nevertheless the most illustrious recent philosophers, who have chosen to follow Plato, have been unwilling to be called Peripatetics, or Academics, but have preferred the name of Platonists.&#160; Among these were the renowned Plotinus, Iamblichus, and Porphyry, who were Greeks, and the African Apuleius, who was learned both in the Greek and Latin tongues.&#160; All these, however, and the rest who were of the same school, and also Plato himself, thought that sacred rites ought to be performed in honor of many gods.</p>
