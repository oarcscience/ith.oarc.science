<p class="c34"><a name="iv.VII.12-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.VII.12-p1.1"></A>Chapter 12.&#8212;That Jupiter is Also Called Pecunia.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.VII.12-p2"></A>How elegantly they have accounted for this name!&#160; &#8220;He is also called Pecunia,&#8221; say they, &#8220;because all things belong to him.&#8221;&#160; Oh how grand an explanation of the name of a deity!&#160; Yes; he to whom all things belong is most meanly and most contumeliously called Pecunia.&#160; In comparison of all things which are contained by heaven and earth, what are all things together which are possessed by men under the name of money?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_273"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">274</FONT></A>
&#160; And this name, forsooth, hath avarice given to Jupiter, that whoever was a lover of money might seem to himself to love not an ordinary god, but the very king of all things himself.&#160; But it would be a far different thing if he had been called Riches.&#160; For riches are one thing, money another.&#160; For we call rich the wise, the just, the good, who have either no money or very little.&#160; For they are more truly rich in possessing virtue, since by it, even as re  <A NAME="page_130"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 130</FONT></A> <a name="iv.VII.12-Page_130"></A>  spects things necessary for the body, they are content with what they have.&#160; But we call the greedy poor, who are always craving and always wanting.&#160; For they may possess ever so great an amount of money; but whatever be the abundance of that, they are not able but to want.&#160; And we properly call God Himself rich; not, however, in money, but in omnipotence.&#160; Therefore they who have abundance of money are called rich, but inwardly needy if they are greedy.&#160; So also, those who have no money are called poor, but inwardly rich if they are wise.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.VII.12-p4"></A>What, then, ought the wise man to think of this theology, in which the king of the gods receives the name of that thing &#8220;which no wise man has desired?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">275</FONT></A>
&#160; For had there been anything wholesomely taught by this philosophy concerning eternal life, how much more appropriately would that god who is the ruler of the world have been called by them, not money, but wisdom, the love of which purges from the filth of avarice, that is, of the love of money!</p>
