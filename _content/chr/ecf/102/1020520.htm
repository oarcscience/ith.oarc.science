<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XVIII.2-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XVIII.2-p1.1"></A>Chapter 2.&#8212;Of the Kings and Times of the Earthly City Which Were Synchronous with the Times of the Saints, Reckoning from the Rise of Abraham.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVIII.2-p2"></A>The society of mortals spread abroad through the earth everywhere, and in the most diverse places, although bound together by a certain fellowship of our common nature, is yet for the most part divided against itself, and the strongest oppress the others, because all follow after their own interests and lusts, while what is longed for either suffices for none, or not for all, because it is not the very thing.&#160; For the vanquished succumb to the victorious, preferring any sort of peace and safety to freedom itself; so that they who chose to die rather than be slaves have been greatly wondered at.&#160; For in almost all nations the very voice of nature somehow proclaims, that those who happen to be conquered should choose rather to be subject to  <A NAME="page_362"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 362</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XVIII.2-Page_362"></A>  their conquerors than to be killed by all kinds of warlike destruction.&#160; This does not take place without the providence of God, in whose power it lies that any one either subdues or is subdued in war; that some are endowed with kingdoms, others made subject to kings.&#160; Now, among the very many kingdoms of the earth into which, by earthly interest or lust, society is divided (which we call by the general name of the city of this world), we see that two, settled and kept distinct from each other both in time and place, have grown far more famous than the rest, first that of the Assyrians, then that of the Romans.&#160; First came the one, then the other.&#160; The former arose in the east, and, immediately on its close, the latter in the west.&#160; I may speak of other kingdoms and other kings as appendages of these.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVIII.2-p3"></A>Ninus, then, who succeeded his father Belus, the first king of Assyria, was already the second king of that kingdom when Abraham was born in the land of the Chaldees.&#160; There was also at that time a very small kingdom of Sicyon, with which, as from an ancient date, that most universally learned man Marcus Varro begins, in writing of the Roman race.&#160; For from these kings of Sicyon he passes to the Athenians, from them to the Latins, and from these to the Romans.&#160; Yet very little is related about these kingdoms, before the foundation of Rome, in comparison with that of Assyria.&#160; For although even Sallust, the Roman historian, admits that the Athenians were very famous in Greece, yet he thinks they were greater in fame than in fact.&#160; For in speaking of them he says, &#8220;The deeds of the Athenians, as I think, were very great and magnificent, but yet somewhat less than reported by fame.&#160; But because writers of great genius arose among them, the deeds of the Athenians were celebrated throughout the world as very great.&#160; Thus the virtue of those who did them was held to be as great as men of transcendent genius could represent it to be by the power of laudatory words.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1133"></A><A HREF="#fn_1133"><FONT SIZE="1">1134</FONT></A>
&#160; This city also derived no small glory from literature and philosophy, the study of which chiefly flourished there.&#160; But as regards empire, none in the earliest times was greater than the Assyrian, or so widely extended.&#160; For when Ninus the son of Belus was king, he is reported to have subdued the whole of Asia, even to the boundaries of Libya, which as to number is called the third part, but as to size is found to be the half of the whole world.&#160; The Indians in the eastern regions were the only people over whom he did not reign; but after his death Semiramis his wife made war on them.&#160; Thus it came to pass that all the people and kings in those countries were subject to the kingdom and authority of the Assyrians, and did whatever they were commanded.&#160; Now Abraham was born in that kingdom among the Chaldees, in the time of Ninus.&#160; But since Grecian affairs are much better known to us than Assyrian, and those who have diligently investigated the antiquity of the Roman nation&#146;s origin have followed the order of time through the Greeks to the Latins, and from them to the Romans, who themselves are Latins, we ought on this account, where it is needful, to mention the Assyrian kings, that it may appear how Babylon, like a first Rome, ran its course along with the city of God, which is a stranger in this world.&#160; But the things proper for insertion in this work in comparing the two cities, that is, the earthly and heavenly, ought to be taken mostly from the Greek and Latin kingdoms, where Rome herself is like a second Babylon.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVIII.2-p5"></A>At Abraham&#146;s birth, then, the second kings of Assyria and Sicyon respectively were Ninus and Europs, the first having been Belus and &AElig;gialeus.&#160; But when God promised Abraham, on his departure from Babylonia, that he should become a great nation, and that in his seed all nations of the earth should be blessed, the Assyrians had their seventh king, the Sicyons their fifth; for the son of Ninus reigned among them after his mother Semiramis, who is said to have been put to death by him for attempting to defile him by incestuously lying with him.&#160; Some think that she founded Babylon, and indeed she may have founded it anew.&#160; But we have told, in the sixteenth book, when or by whom it was founded.&#160; Now the son of Ninus and Semiramis, who succeeded his mother in the kingdom, is also called Ninus by some, but by others Ninias, a patronymic word.&#160; Telexion then held the kingdom of the Sicyons.&#160; In his reign times were quiet and joyful to such a degree, that after his death they worshipped him as a god by offering sacrifices and by celebrating games, which are said to have been first instituted on this occasion.</p>
