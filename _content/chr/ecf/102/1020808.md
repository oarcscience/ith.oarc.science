Doubtful Passage by Other Passages of Scripture Than by Reason.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxviii-p2"></span>39.  When, however, a meaning is
evolved of such a kind that what is doubtful in it cannot be cleared up
by indubitable evidence from Scripture, it remains for us to make it
clear by the evidence of reason.  But this is a dangerous practice.  For
it is far safer to walk by the light of Holy Scripture; so that when we
wish to examine the passages that are obscured by metaphorical
expressions, we may either obtain a meaning about which there is no
controversy, or if a controversy arises, may settle it by the
application of testimonies sought out in every portion of the same
Scripture.
