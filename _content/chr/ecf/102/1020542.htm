<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVIII.24-p2"></A>While Romulus reigned, Thales the Milesian is said to have lived, being one of the seven sages, who succeeded the theological poets, of whom Orpheus was the most renowned, and were called  <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.XVIII.24-p2.1"></A>&#931;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#8055;</span>, that is, sages.&#160; During that time the ten tribes, which on the division of the people were called Israel, were conquered by the Chaldeans and led captive into their lands, while the two tribes which were called Judah, and had the seat of their kingdom in Jerusalem, remained in the land of Judea.&#160; As Romulus, when dead, could nowhere be found, the Romans, as is everywhere notorious, placed him among the gods,&#8212;a thing which by that time had already ceased to be done, and which was not done afterwards till the time of the C&aelig;sars, and then not through error, but in flattery; so that Cicero ascribes great praises to Romulus, because he merited such honors not in rude and unlearned times, when men were easily deceived, but in times already polished and learned, although the subtle and acute loquacity of the philosophers had not yet culminated.&#160; But although the later times did not deify dead men, still they did not cease to hold and worship as gods those deified of old; nay, by images, which the ancients never had, they even increased the allurements of vain and impious superstition, the unclean demons effecting this in their heart, and also deceiving them by lying oracles, so that even the fabulous crimes of the gods, which were not once imagined by a more polite age, were yet basely acted in the plays in honor of these same false deities.&#160; Numa reigned after Romulus; and although he had thought that Rome would be better defended the more gods there were, yet on his death he himself was not counted worthy of a place among them, as if it were supposed that he had so crowded heaven that a place could not be found for him there.&#160; They report that the Samian sibyl lived while he reigned at Rome, and when Manasseh began to reign over the Hebrews,&#8212;an impious king, by whom the prophet Isaiah is said to have been slain.</p>
