<p class="c21"><a name="iv.IV.17-p2"></A>Or do they say, perhaps, that Jupiter sends the goddess Victoria, and that she, as it were acting in obedience to the king of the gods, comes to those to whom he may have despatched her, and takes up her quarters on their side?&#160; This is truly said, not of Jove, whom they, according to their own imagination, feign to be king of the gods, but of Him who is the true eternal King, because he sends, not Victory, who is no person, but His angel, and causes whom He pleases to conquer; whose counsel may be hidden, but cannot be unjust.&#160; For if Victory is a goddess, why is not Triumph also a god, and joined to Victory either as husband, or brother, or son?&#160; Indeed, they have imagined such things concerning the gods, that if the poets had feigned the like, and they should have been discussed by us, they would have replied that they were laughable figments of the poets not to be attributed to true deities.&#160; And yet they themselves did not laugh when they were, not reading in the poets, but worshipping in the temples such doating follies.&#160; Therefore they should entreat Jove alone for all things, and supplicate him only.&#160; For if Victory is a goddess, and is under him as her king, wherever he might have sent her, she could not dare to resist and do her own will rather than his.</p>
