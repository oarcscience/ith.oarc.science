<p class="c21"><a name="iv.II_1.19-p2"></A>Here, then, is this Roman republic, &#8220;which has changed little by little from the fair and virtuous city it was, and has become utterly wicked and dissolute.&#8221;&#160; It is not I who am the first to say this, but their own authors, from whom we learned it for a fee, and who wrote it long before the coming of Christ.&#160; You see how, before the coming of Christ, and after the destruction of Carthage, &#8220;the primitive manners, instead of undergoing insensible alteration, as hitherto they had done, were swept away as by a torrent; and how depraved by luxury and avarice the youth were.&#8221;&#160; Let them now, on their part, read to us any laws given by their gods to the Roman people, and directed against luxury and avarice.&#160; And would that they had only been silent on the subjects of chastity and modesty, and had not demanded from the people indecent and shameful practices, to which they lent a pernicious patronage by their so-called divinity.&#160; Let them read our commandments  <A NAME="page_34"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 34</FONT></A> <a name="iv.II_1.19-Page_34"></A>  in the Prophets, Gospels, Acts of the Apostles or Epistles; let them peruse the large number of precepts against avarice and luxury which are everywhere read to the congregations that meet for this purpose, and which strike the ear, not with the uncertain sound of a philosophical discussion, but with the thunder of God&#146;s own oracle pealing from the clouds.&#160; And yet they do not impute to their gods the luxury and avarice, the cruel and dissolute manners, that had rendered the republic utterly wicked and corrupt, even before the coming of Christ; but whatever affliction their pride and effeminacy have exposed them to in these latter days, they furiously impute to our religion.&#160; If the kings of the earth and all their subjects, if all princes and judges of the earth, if young men and maidens, old and young, every age, and both sexes; if they whom the Baptist addressed, the publicans and the soldiers, were all together to hearken to and observe the precepts of the Christian religion regarding a just and virtuous life, then should the republic adorn the whole earth with its own felicity, and attain in life everlasting to the pinnacle of kingly glory.&#160; But because this man listens and that man scoffs, and most are enamored of the blandishments of vice rather than the wholesome severity of virtue, the people of Christ, whatever be their condition&#8212;whether they be kings, princes, judges, soldiers, or provincials, rich or poor, bond or free, male or female&#8212;are enjoined to endure this earthly republic, wicked and dissolute as it is, that so they may by this endurance win for themselves an eminent place in that most holy and august assembly of angels and republic of heaven, in which the will of God is the law.</p>
