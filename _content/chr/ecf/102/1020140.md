<span id="iv.V-p3"></span> ————————————

<span id="iv.V-p4"></span>Argument—Augustin first discusses the doctrine
of fate, for the sake of confuting those who are disposed to refer to
fate the power and increase of the Roman empire, which could not be
attributed to false gods, as has been shown in the preceding book. 
After that, he proves that there is no contradiction between God’s
prescience and our free will.  He then speaks of the manners of the
ancient Romans, and shows in what sense it was due to the virtue of the
Romans themselves, and in how far to the counsel of God, that he
increased their dominion, though they did not worship him.  Finally, he
explains what is to be accounted the true happiness of the Christian
emperors.
