<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVII.22-p2"></A>But Jeroboam king of Israel, with perverse mind, not believing in God, whom he had proved true in promising and giving him the kingdom, was afraid lest, by coming to the temple of God which was in Jerusalem, where, according to the divine law, that whole nation was to come in order to sacrifice, the people should be seduced from him, and return to David&#146;s line as the seed royal; and set up idolatry in his kingdom, and with horrible impiety beguiled the people, ensnaring them to the worship of idols with himself.&#160; Yet God did not altogether cease to reprove by the prophets, not only that king, but also his successors and imitators in his impiety, and the people too.&#160; For there the great and illustrious prophet Elijah and Elisha his disciple arose, who also did many wonderful works.&#160; Even there, when Elijah said, &#8220;O Lord, they have slain Thy prophets, they have digged down Thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life,&#8221; it was answered that seven thousand men were there who had not bowed the knee to Baal.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1130"></A><A HREF="#fn_1130"><FONT SIZE="1">1131</FONT></A>
