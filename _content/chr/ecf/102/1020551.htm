<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XVIII.33-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XVIII.33-p1.1"></A>Chapter 33.&#8212;What Jeremiah and Zephaniah Have, by the Prophetic Spirit, Spoken Before Concerning Christ and the Calling of the Nations.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVIII.33-p2"></A>Jeremiah, like Isaiah, is one of the greater prophets, not of the minor, like the others from whose writings I have just given extracts.&#160; He prophesied when Josiah reigned in Jerusalem, and Ancus Martius at Rome, when the captivity of the Jews was already at hand; and he continued to prophesy down to the fifth month of the captivity, as we find from his writings.&#160; Zephaniah, one of the minor prophets, is put along with him, because he himself says that he prophesied in the days of Josiah; but he does not say till when.&#160; Jeremiah thus prophesied not only in the times of Ancus Martius, but also in those of Tarquinius Priscus, whom the Romans had for their fifth king.&#160; For he had already begun to reign when that captivity took place.&#160; Jeremiah, in prophesying of Christ, says, &#8220;The breath of our mouth, the Lord Christ, was taken in our sins,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1187"></A><A HREF="#fn_1187"><FONT SIZE="1">1188</FONT></A>
 thus briefly showing both that Christ is our Lord and that He suffered for us.&#160; Also in another place he says, &#8220;This is my God, and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison of Him; who hath found out all the way of prudence, and hath given it to Jacob His servant, and to Israel His beloved:&#160; afterwards He was seen on the earth, and conversed with men.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1188"></A><A HREF="#fn_1188"><FONT SIZE="1">1189</FONT></A>
&#160; Some attribute this testimony not to Jeremiah, but to his secretary, who was called Baruch; but it is more commonly ascribed to Jeremiah.&#160; Again the same prophet says concerning Him, &#8220;Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise up unto David a righteous shoot, and a King shall reign and shall be wise, and shall do judgment and justice in the earth.&#160; In those days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell confidently:&#160; and this is the name which they shall call Him, Our righteous Lord.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1189"></A><A HREF="#fn_1189"><FONT SIZE="1">1190</FONT></A>
&#160; And of the calling of the nations which was to come to pass, and which we now see fulfilled, he thus spoke:&#160; &#8220;O Lord my God, and my refuge in the day of evils, to Thee shall the nations come from  <A NAME="page_380"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 380</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XVIII.33-Page_380"></A>  the utmost end of the earth, saying, Truly our fathers have worshipped lying images, wherein there is no profit.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1190"></A><A HREF="#fn_1190"><FONT SIZE="1">1191</FONT></A>
&#160; But that the Jews, by whom He behoved even to be slain, were not going to acknowledge Him, this prophet thus intimates:&#160; &#8220;Heavy is the heart through all; and He is a man, and who shall know Him?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1191"></A><A HREF="#fn_1191"><FONT SIZE="1">1192</FONT></A>
&#160; That passage also is his which I have quoted in the seventeenth book concerning the new testament, of which Christ is the Mediator.&#160; For Jeremiah himself says, &#8220;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will complete over the house of Jacob a new testament,&#8221; and the rest, which may be read there.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1192"></A><A HREF="#fn_1192"><FONT SIZE="1">1193</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVIII.33-p9"></A>For the present I shall put down those predictions about Christ by the prophet Zephaniah, who prophesied with Jeremiah.&#160; &#8220;Wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, in the day of my resurrection, in the future; because it is my determination to assemble the nations, and gather together the kingdoms.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1193"></A><A HREF="#fn_1193"><FONT SIZE="1">1194</FONT></A>
&#160; And again he says, &#8220;The Lord will be terrible upon them, and will exterminate all the gods of the earth; and they shall worship Him every man from his place, even all the isles of the nations.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1194"></A><A HREF="#fn_1194"><FONT SIZE="1">1195</FONT></A>
&#160; And a little after he says, &#8220;Then will I turn to the people a tongue, and to His offspring, that they may call upon the name of the Lord, and serve Him under one yoke.&#160; From the borders of the rivers of Ethiopia shall they bring sacrifices unto me.&#160; In that day thou shall not be confounded for all thy curious inventions, which thou hast done impiously against me:&#160; for then I will take away from thee the haughtiness of thy trespass; and thou shalt no more magnify thyself above thy holy mountain.&#160; And I will leave in thee a meek and humble people, and they who shall be left of Israel shall fear the name of the Lord.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1195"></A><A HREF="#fn_1195"><FONT SIZE="1">1196</FONT></A>
&#160; These are the remnant of whom the apostle quotes that which is elsewhere prophesied:&#160; &#8220;Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1196"></A><A HREF="#fn_1196"><FONT SIZE="1">1197</FONT></A>
&#160; These are the remnant of that nation who have believed in Christ.</p>
