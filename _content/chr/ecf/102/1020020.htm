<p class="c21"><a name="iv.ii.xv-p2"></A>But, say they, many Christians were even led away captive.&#160; This indeed were a most pitiable fate, if they could be led away to any place where they could not find their God.&#160; But for this calamity also sacred Scripture affords great consolation.&#160; The three youths&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A>
