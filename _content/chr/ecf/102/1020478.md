<span id="iv.XVI.29-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.29-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29.—Of the Three Men or Angels, in
Whom the Lord is Related to Have Appeared to Abraham at the Oak of
Mamre.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.29-p2"></span>God appeared again to Abraham at the oak
of Mamre in three men, who it is not to be doubted were angels, although
some think that one of them was Christ, and assert that He was visible
before He put on flesh.  Now it belongs to the divine power, and
invisible, incorporeal, and incommutable nature, without changing itself
at all, to appear even to mortal men, not by what it is, but by what is
subject to it.  And what is not subject to it?  Yet if they try to
establish that one of these three was Christ by the fact that, although
he saw three, he addressed the Lord in the singular, as it is written,
“And, lo, three men stood by him:  and, when he saw them, he ran <span
id="page_328">p. 328</span> <span id="iv.XVI.29-Page_328"></span> to
meet them from the tent-door, and worshipped toward the ground, and
said, Lord, if I have found favor before thee,” <span
id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930) etc.; why do they not advert to this
also, that when two of them came to destroy the Sodomites, while Abraham
still spoke to one, calling him Lord, and interceding that he would not
destroy the righteous along with the wicked in Sodom, Lot received these
two in such a way that he too in his conversation with them addressed
the Lord in the singular?  For after saying to them in the plural,
“Behold, my lords, turn aside into your servant’s house,” <span
id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931) etc., yet it is afterwards said, “And
the angels laid hold upon his hand, and the hand of his wife, and the
hands of his two daughters, because the Lord was merciful unto him.  And
it came to pass, whenever they had led him forth abroad, that they said,
Save thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all this
region:  save thyself in the mountain, lest thou be caught.  And Lot
said unto them, I pray thee, Lord, since thy servant hath found grace in
thy sight,” <span id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932) etc.  And then after
these words the Lord also answered him in the singular, although He was
in two angels, saying, “See, I have accepted thy face,” <span
id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933) etc.  This makes it much more credible
that both Abraham in the three men and Lot in the two recognized the
Lord, addressing Him in the singular number, even when they were
addressing men; for they received them as they did for no other reason
than that they might minister human refection to them as men who needed
it.  Yet there was about them something so excellent, that those who
showed them hospitality as men could not doubt that God was in them as
He was wont to be in the prophets, and therefore sometimes addressed
them in the plural, and sometimes God in them in the singular.  But that
they were angels the Scripture testifies, not only in this book of
Genesis, in which these transactions are related, but also in the
Epistle to the Hebrews, where in praising hospitality it is said, “For
thereby some have entertained angels unawares.” <span
id="fr_934"></span>[935](#fn_934)   By these three men, then, when a son
Isaac was again promised to Abraham by Sarah, such a divine oracle was
also given that it was said, “Abraham shall become a great and numerous
nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him.” <span
id="fr_935"></span>[936](#fn_935)   And here these two things, are
promised with the utmost brevity and fullness,—the nation of Israel
according to the flesh, and all nations according to faith.
