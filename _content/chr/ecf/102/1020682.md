<span id="iv.XXII.21-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXII.21-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—Of the New Spiritual Body into
Which the Flesh of the Saints Shall Be Transformed.</span>

<span id="iv.XXII.21-p2"></span>Whatever, therefore, has been taken from
the body, either during life or after death shall be restored to it,
and, in conjunction with what has remained in the grave, shall rise
again, transformed from the oldness of the animal body into the newness
of the spiritual body, and clothed in incorruption and immortality.  But
even though the body has been all quite ground to powder by some severe
accident, or by the ruthlessness of enemies, and though it has been so
diligently scattered to the winds, or into the water, that there is no
trace of it left, yet it shall not be beyond the omnipotence of the
Creator,—no, not a hair of its head shall perish.  The flesh shall then
be spiritual, and subject to the spirit, but still flesh, not spirit, as
the spirit itself, when subject to the flesh, was fleshly, but still
spirit and not flesh.  And of this we have experimental proof in the
deformity of our penal condition.  For those persons were carnal, not in
a fleshly, but in a spiritual way, to whom the apostle said, “I could
not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.” <span
id="fr_1649"></span>[1650](#fn_1649)   And a man is in this life
spiritual in such a way, that he is yet carnal with respect to his body,
and sees another law in his members warring against the law of his mind;
but even in his body he will be spiritual when the same flesh shall have
had that resurrection of which these words speak, “It is sown an animal
body, it shall rise a spiritual body.” <span
id="fr_1650"></span>[1651](#fn_1650)   But what this spiritual body
shall be and how great its grace, I fear it were but rash to pronounce,
seeing that we have as yet no experience of it.  Nevertheless, since it
is fit that the joyfulness of our hope should utter itself, and so show
forth God’s praise, and since it was from the profoundest sentiment of
ardent and holy love that the Psalmist cried, “O Lord, I have loved the
beauty of Thy house,” <span id="fr_1651"></span>[1652](#fn_1651) we may,
with God’s help, speak of the gifts He lavishes on men, good and bad
alike, in this most wretched life, and may do our best to conjecture the
great glory of that state which we cannot worthily speak of, because we
have not yet experienced it.  For I say nothing of the time when God
made man upright; I say nothing of the happy life of “the man and his
wife” in the fruitful garden, since it was so short that none of their
children experienced it:  I speak only of this life which we know, and
in which we now are, from the temptations of which we cannot escape so
long as we are in it, no matter what progress we make, for it is all
temptation, and I ask, Who can describe the tokens of God’s goodness
that are extended to the human race even in this life?
