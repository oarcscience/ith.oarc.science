<span id="iv.ii.iii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—That It is Quite Contrary to the
Usage of War, that the Victors Should Spare the Vanquished for the Sake
of Their Gods.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p2"></span>There are histories of numberless wars,
both before the building of Rome and since its rise and the extension of
its dominion; let these be read, and let one instance be cited in which,
when a city had been taken by foreigners, the victors spared those who
were found to have fled for sanctuary to the temples of their
gods; <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33) or one instance in which a
barbarian general gave orders that none should be put to the sword who
had been found in this or that temple.  Did not Æneas see

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p4"></span>“Dying Priam at the shrine,

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p5"></span>Staining the hearth he made
divine?” <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34)

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p7"></span>Did not Diomede and Ulysses

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p8"></span>“Drag with red hands, the sentry slain,

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p9"></span>Her fateful image from your fane,

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p10"></span>Her chaste locks touch, and stain with
gore

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p11"></span>The virgin coronal she wore?” <span
id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35)

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p13"></span>Neither is that true which follows, that

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p14"></span>“Thenceforth the tide of fortune
changed,

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p15"></span>And Greece grew weak.” <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36)

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p17"></span>For after this they conquered and
destroyed Troy with fire and sword; after this they beheaded Priam as he
fled to the altars.  Neither did Troy perish because it lost Minerva. 
For what had Minerva herself first lost, that she should perish?  Her
guards perhaps?  No doubt; just her guards.  For as soon as they were
slain, she could be stolen.  It was not, in fact, the men who were
preserved by the image, but the image by the men.  How, <span
id="page_3">p. 3</span> <span id="iv.ii.iii-Page_3"></span> then, was
she invoked to defend the city and the citizens, she who could not
defend her own defenders?
