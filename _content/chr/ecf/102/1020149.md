<span id="iv.V.8-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.V.8-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—Concerning Those Who Call by the Name
of Fate, Not the Position of the Stars, But the Connection of Causes
Which Depends on the Will of God.</span>

<span id="iv.V.8-p2"></span>But, as to those who call by the name of
fate, not the disposition of the stars as it may exist when any creature
is conceived, or born, or commences its existence, but the whole
connection and train of causes which makes everything become what it
does become, there is no need that I should labor and strive with them
in a merely verbal controversy, since they attribute the so-called order
and connection of causes to the will and power of God most high, who is
most rightly and most truly believed to know all things before they come
to pass, and to leave nothing unordained; from whom are all powers,
although the wills of all are not from Him.  Now, that it is chiefly the
will of God most high, whose power extends itself irresistibly through
all things which they call fate, is proved by the following verses, of
which, if I mistake not, Annæus Seneca is the author:—

<span id="iv.V.8-p3"></span>“Father supreme, Thou ruler of the lofty
heavens,

<span id="iv.V.8-p4"></span>Lead me where’er it is Thy pleasure; I will
give

<span id="iv.V.8-p5"></span>A prompt obedience, making no delay,

<span id="iv.V.8-p6"></span>Lo! here I am.  Promptly I come to do Thy
sovereign will;

<span id="iv.V.8-p7"></span>If thy command shall thwart my inclination,
I will still

<span id="iv.V.8-p8"></span>Follow Thee groaning, and the work assigned,

<span id="iv.V.8-p9"></span>With all the suffering of a mind repugnant,

<span id="iv.V.8-p10"></span>Will perform, being evil; which, had I been
good,

<span id="iv.V.8-p11"></span>I should have undertaken and performed,
though hard,

<span id="iv.V.8-p12"></span>With virtuous cheerfulness.

<span id="iv.V.8-p13"></span>The Fates do lead the man that follows
willing;

<span id="iv.V.8-p14"></span>But the man that is unwilling, him they
drag.” <span id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191)

<span id="iv.V.8-p16"></span>Most evidently, in this last verse, he
calls that “fate” which he had before called “the will of the Father
supreme,” whom, he says, he is ready to obey that he may be led, being
willing, not dragged, being unwilling, since “the Fates do lead the man
that follows willing, but the man that is unwilling, him they drag.”

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span> <span id="iv.V.8-Page_90"></span>

<span id="iv.V.8-p17"></span>The following Homeric lines, which Cicero
translates into Latin, also favor this opinion :—

<span id="iv.V.8-p18"></span>“Such are the minds of men, as is the light

<span id="iv.V.8-p19"></span>Which Father Jove himself doth pour

<span id="iv.V.8-p20"></span>Illustrious o’er the fruitful earth.” <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192)

<span id="iv.V.8-p22"></span>Not that Cicero wishes that a poetical
sentiment should have any weight in a question like this; for when he
says that the Stoics, when asserting the power of fate, were in the
habit of using these verses from Homer, he is not treating concerning
the opinion of that poet, but concerning that of those philosophers,
since by these verses, which they quote in connection with the
controversy which they hold about fate, is most distinctly manifested
what it is which they reckon fate, since they call by the name of
Jupiter him whom they reckon the supreme god, from whom, they say, hangs
the whole chain of fates.
