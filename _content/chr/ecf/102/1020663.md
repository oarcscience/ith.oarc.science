<span id="iv.XXII.2-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXII.2-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—Of the Eternal and Unchangeable
Will of God.</span>

<span id="iv.XXII.2-p2"></span>It is true that wicked men do many things
contrary to God’s will; but so great is His wisdom and power, that all
things which seem adverse to His purpose do still tend towards those
just and good ends and issues which He Himself has foreknown.  And
consequently, when God is said to change His will, as when, *e.g*., He
becomes angry with those to whom He was gentle, it is rather they than
He who are changed, and they find Him changed in so far as their
experience of suffering at His hand is new, as the sun is changed to
injured eyes, and becomes as it were fierce from being mild, and hurtful
from being delightful, though in itself it remains the same as it was. 
That also is called the will of God which He does in the hearts of those
who obey His commandments; and of this the apostle says, “For it is God
that worketh in you both to will.” <span
id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603)   As God’s “righteousness” is used
not only of the righteousness wherewith He Himself is righteous, but
also of that which He produces in the man whom He justifies, so also
that is called His law, which, though given by God, is rather the law of
men.  For certainly they were men to whom Jesus said, “It is written in
your law,” <span id="fr_1604"></span>[1605](#fn_1604) though in another
place we read, “The law of his God is in his heart.” <span
id="fr_1605"></span>[1606](#fn_1605)   According to this will which God
works in men, He is said also to will what He Himself does not will, but
causes His people to will; as He is said to know what He has caused
those to know who were ignorant of it.  For when the apostle says, “But
now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God,” <span
id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606) we cannot suppose that God there
for the first time knew those who were foreknown by Him before the
foundation of the world; but He is said to have known them then, because
then He caused them to know.  But I remember that I discussed these
modes of expression in the preceding books.  According to this will,
then, by which we say that God wills what He causes to be willed by
others, from whom the future is hidden, He wills many things which He
does not perform.

<span id="iv.XXII.2-p7"></span>Thus His saints, inspired by His holy
will, desire many things which never happen.  They pray, *e.g*., for
certain individuals—they pray in a pious and holy manner—but what they
request He does not perform, though He Himself by His own Holy Spirit
has wrought in them this will to pray.  And consequently, when the
saints, in conformity with God’s mind, will and pray that all men be
saved, we can use this mode of expression:  God wills and does not
perform,—meaning that He who causes them to will these things Himself
wills them.  But if we speak of that will of His which is eternal as His
foreknowledge, certainly He has already done all things in heaven and on
earth that He has willed,—not only past and present things, but even
things still future.  But before the arrival of that time in which He
has willed the occurrence of what He foreknew and arranged before all
time, we say, It will happen when God wills.  But if we are ignorant not
only of the time in which it is to be, but even whether it shall be at
all, we say, It will happen if God wills,—not because God will then have
a new will which He had not before, but because that event, which from
eternity has been prepared in His unchangeable will, shall then come to
pass.
