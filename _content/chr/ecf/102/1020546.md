<span id="iv.XVIII.28-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVIII.28-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—Of the Things Pertaining to the
Gospel of Christ Which Hosea and Amos Prohesied.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.28-p2"></span>The prophet Hosea speaks so very
profoundly that it is laborious work to penetrate his meaning.  But,
according to promise, we must insert something from his book.  He says,
“And it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto
them, Ye are not my people, there they shall be called the sons of the
living God.” <span id="fr_1152"></span>[1153](#fn_1152)   Even the
apostles understood this as a prophetic testimony of the calling of the
nations who did not formerly belong to God; and because this same people
of the Gentiles is itself spiritually among the children of Abraham, and
for that reason is rightly called Israel, therefore he goes on to say,
“And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered
together in one, and shall appoint themselves one headship, and shall
ascend from the earth.” <span id="fr_1153"></span>[1154](#fn_1153)   We
should but weaken the savor of this prophetic oracle if we set ourselves
to expound it.  Let the reader but call to mind that cornerstone and
those two walls of partition, the one of the Jews, the other of the
Gentiles, <span id="fr_1154"></span>[1155](#fn_1154) and he will
recognize them, the one under the term sons of Judah, the other as sons
of Israel, supporting themselves by one and the same headship, and
ascending from the earth.  But that those carnal Israelites who are now
unwilling to believe in Christ shall afterward believe, that is, their
children shall (for they themselves, of course, shall go to their own
place by dying), this same prophet testifies, saying, “For the children
of Israel shall abide many days without a king, without a prince,
without a sacrifice, without an altar, without a priesthood, without
manifestations.” <span id="fr_1155"></span>[1156](#fn_1155)   Who does
not see that the Jews are now thus?  But let us hear what he adds:  “And
afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord their
God, and David their king, and shall be amazed at the Lord and at His
goodness in the latter days.” <span id="fr_1156"></span>[1157](#fn_1156)
<span id="page_376">p. 376</span> <span
id="iv.XVIII.28-Page_376"></span> Nothing is clearer than this prophecy,
in which by David, as distinguished by the title of king, Christ is to
be understood, “who is made,” as the apostle says, “of the seed of David
according to the flesh.” <span id="fr_1157"></span>[1158](#fn_1157)  
This prophet has also foretold the resurrection of Christ on the third
day, as it behoved to be foretold, with prophetic loftiness, when he
says, “He will heal us after two days, and in the third day we shall
rise again.” <span id="fr_1158"></span>[1159](#fn_1158)   In agreement
with this the apostle says to us, “If ye be risen with Christ, seek
those things which are above.” <span
id="fr_1159"></span>[1160](#fn_1159)   Amos also prophesies thus
concerning such things:  “Prepare thee, that thou mayst invoke thy God,
O Israel; for lo, I am binding the thunder, and creating the spirit, and
announcing to men their Christ.” <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[1161](#fn_1160)   And in another place he says, “In
that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and
build up the breaches thereof:  and I will raise up his ruins, and will
build them up again as in the days of old:  that the residue of men may
inquire for me, and all the nations upon whom my name is invoked, saith
the Lord that doeth this.” <span id="fr_1161"></span>[1162](#fn_1161)
