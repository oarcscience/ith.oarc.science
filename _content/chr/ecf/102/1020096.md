id="iv.III.23-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Of the Internal Disasters Which
Vexed the Roman Republic, and Followed a Portentous Madness Which Seized
All the Domestic Animals.</span>

<span id="iv.III.23-p2"></span>But let us now mention, as succinctly as
possible, those disasters which were still more vexing, because nearer
home; I mean those discords which are erroneously called civil, since
they destroy civil interests.  The seditions had now become urban wars,
in which blood was freely shed, and in which parties raged against one
another, not with wrangling and verbal contention, but with physical
force and arms.  What a sea of Roman blood was shed, what desolations
and devastations were occasioned in Italy by wars social, wars servile,
wars civil!  Before the Latins began the social war against Rome, all
the animals used in the service of man—dogs, horses, asses, oxen, and
all the rest that are subject to man—suddenly grew wild, and forgot
their domesticated tameness, forsook their stalls and wandered at large,
and could not be closely approached either by strangers or their own
masters without danger.  If this was a portent, how serious a calamity
must have been portended by a plague which, whether portent or no, was
in itself a serious calamity!  Had it happened in our day, the heathen
would have been more rabid against us than their animals were against
them.
