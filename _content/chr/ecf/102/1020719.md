<span id="v.iv.xxiii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Man Needs No Injunction to Love
Himself and His Own Body.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xxiii-p2"></span>22.  Those things which are objects of
use are not all, however, to be loved, but those only which are either
united with us in a common relation to God, such as a man or an angel,
or are so related to us as to need the goodness of God through our
instrumentality, such as the body.  For assuredly the martyrs did not
love the wickedness of their persecutors, although they used it to
attain the favor of God.  As, then, there are four kinds of things that
are to be loved,—first, that which is above us; second, ourselves;
third, that which is on a level with us; fourth, that which is beneath
us,—no precepts need be given about the second and fourth of these. 
For, however far a man may fall away from the truth, he still continues
to love himself, and to love his own body.  The soul which flies away
from the unchangeable Light, the Ruler of all things, does so that it
may rule over itself and over its own body; and so it cannot but love
both itself and its own body.

<span id="v.iv.xxiii-p3"></span>23.  Morever, it thinks it has attained
something very great if it is able to lord it over its companions, that
is, other men.  For it is inherent in the sinful soul to desire above
all things, and to claim as due to itself, that which is properly due to
God only.  Now such love of itself is more correctly called hate.  For
it is not just that it should desire what is beneath it to be obedient
to it while itself will not obey its own superior; and most justly has
it been said, “He who loveth iniquity hateth his own soul.” <span
id="fr_1733"></span>[1734](#fn_1733)   And accordingly the soul becomes
weak, and endures much suffering about the mortal body.  For, of course,
it must love the body, and be grieved at its corruption; and the
immortality and incorruptibility of the body spring out of the health of
the soul.  Now the health of the soul is to cling steadfastly to the
better part, that is, to the unchangeable God.  But when it aspires to
lord it even over those who are by nature its equals,—that is, its
fellow-men,—this is a reach of arrogance utterly intolerable.
