id="v.v.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38.—The Science of Numbers Not
Created, But Only Discovered, by Man.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxxviii-p2"></span>56.  Coming now to the science of
number, it is clear to the dullest apprehension that this was not
created by man, but was discovered by investigation.  For, though Virgil
could at his own pleasure make the first syllable of *Italia* long,
while the ancients pronounced it short, it is not in any man’s power to
determine at his pleasure that three times three are not nine, or do not
make a square, or are not the triple of three, nor one and a half times
the number six, or that it is not true that they are not the double of
any number because odd numbers <span
id="fr_1820"></span>[1821](#fn_1820) have no half.  Whether, then,
numbers are considered in themselves, or as applied to the laws of
figures, or of sounds, or of other motions, they have fixed laws which
were not made by man, but which the acuteness of ingenious men brought
to light.

<span id="v.v.xxxviii-p4"></span>57.  The man, however, who puts so high
a value on these things as to be inclined to boast himself one of the
learned, and who does not rather inquire after the source from which
those things which he perceives to be true derive their truth, and from
which those others which he perceives to be unchangeable also derive
their truth and unchangeableness, and who, mounting up from bodily
appearances to the mind of man, and finding that it too is changeable
(for it is sometimes instructed, at other times uninstructed), although
it holds a middle place between the unchangeable truth above it and the
changeable things beneath it, does not strive to make all things redound
to the praise and love of the one God from whom he knows that all things
have their being;—the man, I say, who acts in this way may seem to be
learned, but wise he cannot in any sense be deemed.
