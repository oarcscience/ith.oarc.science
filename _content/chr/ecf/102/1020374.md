<span id="iv.XIII.7-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIII.7-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—Of the Death Which the
Unbaptized <span id="fr_584"></span>[585](#fn_584) Suffer for the
Confession of Christ.</span>

<span id="iv.XIII.7-p3"></span>For whatever unbaptized persons die
confessing Christ, this confession is of the same efficacy for the
remission of sins as if they were washed in the sacred font of baptism. 
For He who said, “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of God,” <span
id="fr_585"></span>[586](#fn_585) made also an exception in their favor,
in that other sentence where He no less absolutely said, “Whosoever
shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father
which is in heaven;” <span id="fr_586"></span>[587](#fn_586) and in
another place, “Whosoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find
it.” <span id="fr_587"></span>[588](#fn_587)   And this explains the
verse, “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His
saints.” <span id="fr_588"></span>[589](#fn_588)   For what is more
precious than a death by which a man’s sins are all forgiven, and his
merits increased an hundredfold?  For those who have been baptized when
they could no longer escape death, and have departed this life with all
their sins blotted out have not equal merit with those who did not defer
death, though it was in their power to do so, but preferred to end their
life by confessing Christ, rather than by denying Him to secure an
opportunity of baptism.  And even had they denied Him under pressure of
the fear of death, this too would have been forgiven them in that
baptism, in which was remitted even the enormous wickedness of those who
had slain Christ.  But how abundant in these men must have been the
grace of the Spirit, who breathes where He listeth, seeing that they so
dearly loved Christ as to be unable to deny Him even in so sore an
emergency, and with so sure a hope of pardon!  Precious, therefore, is
the death of the saints, to whom the grace of Christ has been applied
with such gracious effects, that they do not hesitate to meet death
themselves, if so be they might meet Him.  And precious is it, also,
because it has proved that what was originally ordained for the
punishment of the sinner, has been used for the production of a richer
harvest of righteousness.  But not on this account should we look upon
death as a good thing, for it is diverted to such useful purposes, not
by any virtue of its own, but by the divine interference.  Death was
originally proposed as an object of dread, that sin might not be
committed; now it must be undergone that sin may not be committed, or,
if committed, be remitted, and the award of righteousness bestowed on
him whose victory has earned it.
