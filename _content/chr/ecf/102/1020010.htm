<p class="c26"><a name="iv.ii.v-p2"></A>Troy itself, the mother of the Roman people, was not able, as I have said, to protect its own citizens in the sacred places of their gods from the fire and sword of the Greeks, though the Greeks worshipped the same gods.&#160; Not only so, but</p>

<p class="c28"><a name="iv.ii.v-p6"></A>Snatched from the burning shrines away,</p>

<p class="c28"><a name="iv.ii.v-p8"></A>Rich altars, bowls of massy gold,</p>  
<p class="c28"><a name="iv.ii.v-p9"></A>And captive raiment, rudely rolled</p>  
<p class="c39"><a name="iv.ii.v-p10"></A>In one promiscuous heap;</p>  
<p class="c28"><a name="iv.ii.v-p11"></A>While boys and matrons, wild with fear,</p>

 Greeks appropriated that temple of Juno to the purposes of their own avarice and pride; while these churches of Christ were chosen even by the savage barbarians as the fit scenes for humility and mercy.&#160; But perhaps, after all, the Greeks did in that victory of theirs spare the temples of those gods whom they worshipped in common with the Trojans, and did not dare to put to the sword or make captive the wretched and vanquished Trojans who fled thither; and perhaps Virgil, in the manner of poets, has depicted what never really happened?&#160; But there is no question that he depicted the usual custom of an enemy when sacking a city.</p>
