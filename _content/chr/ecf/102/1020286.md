id="iv.X.15-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—Of the Ministry of the Holy Angels,
by Which They Fulfill the Providence of God.</span>

<span id="iv.X.15-p2"></span>And so it has pleased Divine Providence, as
I have said, and as we read in the Acts of the Apostles, <span
id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408) that the law enjoining the worship of
one God should be given by the disposition of angels.  But among them
the person of God Himself visibly appeared, not, indeed, in His proper
substance, which ever remains invisible to mortal eyes, but by the
infallible signs furnished by creation in obedience to its Creator.  He
made use, too, of the words of human speech, uttering them syllable by
syllable successively, though in His own nature He speaks not in a
bodily but in a spiritual way; not to sense, but to the mind; not in
words that occupy time, but, if I may so say, eternally, neither
beginning to speak nor coming to an end.  And what He says is accurately
heard, not by the bodily but by the mental ear of His ministers and
messengers, who are immortally blessed in the enjoyment of His
unchangeable truth; and the directions which they in some ineffable way
receive, they execute without delay or difficulty in the sensible and
visible world.  And this law was given in conformity with the age of the
world, and contained at the first earthly promises, as I have said,
which, however, symbolized eternal ones; and these eternal blessings few
understood, though many took a part in the celebration of their visible
signs.  Nevertheless, with one consent both the words and the visible
rites of that law enjoin the worship of one God,—not one of a crowd of
gods, but Him who made heaven and earth, and every soul and every spirit
which is other than Himself.  He created; all else was created; and,
both for being and well-being, all things need Him who created them.
