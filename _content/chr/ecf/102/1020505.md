<span id="iv.XVII.12"></span>

<span id="iv.XVII.12-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVII.12-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—To Whose Person the Entreaty for
the Promises is to Be Understood to Belong, When He Says in the Psalm,
“Where are Thine Ancient Compassions, Lord?” Etc.</span>

<span id="iv.XVII.12-p2"></span>But the rest of this psalm runs thus: 
“Where are Thine ancient compassions, Lord, which Thou swarest unto
David in Thy truth?  Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants, which
I have borne in my bosom of many nations; wherewith Thine enemies have
reproached, O Lord, wherewith they have reproached the change of Thy
Christ.” <span id="fr_1066"></span>[1067](#fn_1066)   Now it may with
very good reason be asked whether this is spoken in the person of those
Israelites who desired that the promise made to David might be fulfilled
to them; or rather of the Christians, who are Israelites not after the
flesh but after the Spirit. <span id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067)  
This certainly was spoken or written in the time of Ethan, from whose
name this psalm gets its title, and that was the same as the time of
David’s reign; and therefore it would not have been said, “Where are
Thine ancient compassions, Lord, which Thou hast sworn unto David in Thy
truth?” unless the prophet had assumed the person of those who should
come long afterwards, to whom that time when these things were promised
to David was ancient.  But it may be understood thus, that many nations,
when they persecuted the Christians, reproached them with the passion of
Christ, which Scripture calls His change, because by dying He is made
immortal.  The change of Christ, according to this passage, may also be
understood to be reproached by the Israelites, because, when they hoped
He would be theirs, He was made the Saviour of the nations; and many
nations who have believed in Him by the New Testament now reproach them
who remain in the old with this:  so that it is said, “Remember, Lord,
the reproach of Thy servants;” because through the Lord’s not
forgetting, but rather pitying them, even they after this reproach are
to believe.  But what I have put first seems to me the most suitable
meaning.  For to the enemies of Christ who are reproached with this,
that Christ hath left them, turning to the Gentiles, <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068) this speech is incongruously
assigned, “Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants,” for such Jews
are not to be styled the servants of God; but these words fit those who,
if they suffered great humiliations through persecution for the name of
Christ, could call to mind that an exalted kingdom had been promised to
the seed of David, and in desire of it, could say not despairingly, but
as asking, seeking, knocking, <span id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069)
“Where are Thine ancient compassions, Lord, which Thou swarest unto
David in Thy truth?  Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants, that
I have borne in my bosom of many nations;” that is, have patiently
endured in my inward parts.  “That Thine enemies have reproached, O
Lord, wherewith they have reproached the change of Thy Christ,” not
thinking it a change, but a consumption. <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070)   But what does “Remember, Lord,”
mean, but that Thou wouldst have compassion, and wouldst for my
patiently borne humiliation reward me with the excellency which Thou
swarest unto David in Thy truth?  But if we assign these words to the
Jews, those servants of God who, on the conquest of the earthly
Jerusalem, before Jesus Christ was born after the manner of men, were
led into captivity, could say such things, understanding the change of
Christ, because indeed through Him was to be surely expected, not an
earthly and carnal felicity, such as appeared during the few years of
king Solomon, but a heavenly and spiritual felicity; and when the
nations, then ignorant of this through unbelief, exulted over and
insulted the people of God for being captives, what else was this than
ignorantly to reproach with the change of Christ those who understand
the change of Christ?  And therefore what follows when this psalm is
concluded, “Let the blessing of the Lord be for evermore, amen, amen,”
is suitable enough for the whole people of God belonging to the heavenly
Jerusalem, whether for those things that lay hid in the Old Testament
before the New <span id="page_352">p. 352</span> <span
id="iv.XVII.12-Page_352"></span> was revealed, or for those that, being
now revealed in the New Testament, are manifestly discerned to belong to
Christ.  For the blessing of the Lord in the seed of David does not
belong to any particular time, such as appeared in the days of Solomon,
but is for evermore to be hoped for, in which most certain hope it is
said, “Amen, amen;” for this repetition of the word is the confirmation
of that hope.  Therefore David understanding this, says in the second
Book of Kings, in the passage from which we digressed to this
psalm, <span id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071) “Thou hast spoken also
for Thy servant’s house for a great while to come.” <span
id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072)   Therefore also a little after he
says, “Now begin, and bless the house of Thy servant for evermore,”
etc., because the son was then about to be born from whom his posterity
should be continued to Christ, through whom his house should be eternal,
and should also be the house of God.  For it is called the house of
David on account of David’s race; but the selfsame is called the house
of God on account of the temple of God, made of men, not of stones,
where shall dwell for evermore the people with and in their God, and God
with and in His people, so that God may fill His people, and the people
be filled with their God, while God shall be all in all, Himself their
reward in peace who is their strength in war.  Therefore, when it is
said in the words of Nathan, “And the Lord will tell thee what an house
thou shalt build for Him,” <span id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073) it
is afterwards said in the words of David, “For Thou, Lord Almighty, God
of Israel, hast opened the ear of Thy servant, saying, I will build thee
an house.” <span id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074)   For this house
is built both by us through living well, and by God through helping us
to live well; for “except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain
that build it.” <span id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075)   And when
the final dedication of this house shall take place, then what God here
says by Nathan shall be fulfilled, “And I will appoint a place for my
people Israel, and will plant him, and he shall dwell apart, and shall
be troubled no more; and the son of iniquity shall not humble him any
more, as from the beginning, from the days when I appointed judges over
my people Israel.” <span id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076)
