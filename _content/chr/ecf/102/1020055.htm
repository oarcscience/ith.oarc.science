<p class="c21"><a name="iv.II_1.12-p2"></A>The Romans, however, as Scipio boasts in that same discussion, declined having their conduct and good name subjected to the assaults and slanders of the poets, and went so far as to make it a capital crime if any one should dare to compose such verses.&#160; This was a very honorable course to pursue, so far as they themselves were concerned, but in respect of the gods it was proud and irreligious:&#160; for they knew that the gods not only tolerated, but relished, being lashed by the injurious expressions of the poets, and yet they themselves would not suffer this same handling; and what their ritual prescribed as acceptable to the gods, their law prohibited as injurious to themselves.&#160; How then, Scipio, do you praise the Romans for refusing this license to the poets, so that no citizen could be calumniated, while you know that the gods were not included under this protection?&#160; Do you count your senate-house worthy of so much higher a regard than the Capitol?&#160; Is the one city of Rome more valuable in your eyes than the whole heaven of gods, that you prohibit your poets from uttering any injurious words against a citizen, though they may with impunity cast what imputations they please upon the gods, without the interference of senator, censor, prince, or pontiff?&#160; It was, forsooth, intolerable that Plautus or N&aelig;vus should attack Publius and Cneius Scipio, insufferable that C&aelig;cilius should lampoon Cato; but quite proper that your Terence should encourage youthful lust by the wicked example of supreme Jove.</p>
