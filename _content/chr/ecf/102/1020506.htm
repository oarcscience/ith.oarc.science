<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVII.13-p2"></A>Whoever hopes for this so great good in this world, and in this earth, his wisdom is but folly.&#160; Can any one think it was fulfilled in the peace of Solomon&#146;s reign?&#160; Scripture certainly commends that peace with excellent praise as a shadow of that which is to come.&#160; But this opinion is to be vigilantly opposed, since after it is said, &#8220;And the son of iniquity shall not humble him any more,&#8221; it is immediately added, &#8220;as from the beginning, from the days in which I appointed judges over my people Israel.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1077"></A><A HREF="#fn_1077"><FONT SIZE="1">1078</FONT></A>
&#160; For the judges were appointed over that people from the time when they received the land of promise, before kings had begun to be there.&#160; And certainly the son of iniquity, that is, the foreign enemy, humbled him through periods of time in which we read that peace alternated with wars; and in that period longer times of peace are found than Solomon had, who reigned forty years.&#160; For under that judge who is called Ehud there were eighty years of peace.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1078"></A><A HREF="#fn_1078"><FONT SIZE="1">1079</FONT></A>
&#160; Be it far from us, therefore, that we should believe the times of Solomon are predicted in this promise, much less indeed those of any other king whatever.&#160; For none other of them reigned in such great peace as he; nor did that nation ever at all hold that kingdom so as to have no anxiety lest it should be subdued by enemies:&#160; for in the very great mutability of human affairs such great security is never given to any people, that it should not dread invasions hostile to this life.&#160; Therefore the place of this promised peaceful and secure habitation is eternal, and of right belongs eternally to Jerusalem the free mother, where the genuine people of Israel shall be:&#160; for this name is interpreted &#8220;Seeing God;&#8221; in the desire of which reward a pious life is to be led through faith in this miserable pilgrimage.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1079"></A><A HREF="#fn_1079"><FONT SIZE="1">1080</FONT></A>
