<p class="c21"><a name="iv.IV.13-p2"></A>But if they contend that only rational animals, such as men, are parts of God, I do not really see how, if the whole world is God, they can separate beasts from being parts of Him.&#160; But what need is there of striving about that?&#160; Concerning the rational animal himself,&#8212;that is, man,&#8212;what more unhappy belief can be entertained than that a part of God is whipped when a boy is whipped?&#160; And who, unless he is quite mad, could bear the thought that parts of God can become lascivi  <A NAME="page_72"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 72</FONT></A> <a name="iv.IV.13-Page_72"></A>  ous, iniquitous, impious, and altogether damnable?&#160; In brief, why is God angry at those who do not worship Him, since these offenders are parts of Himself?&#160; It remains, therefore, that they must say that all the gods have their own lives; that each one lives for himself, and none of them is a part of any one; but that all are to be worshipped,&#8212;at least as many as can be known and worshipped; for they are so many it is impossible that all can be so.&#160; And of all these, I believe that Jupiter, because he presides as king, is thought by them to have both established and extended the Roman empire.&#160; For if he has not done it, what other god do they believe could have attempted so great a work, when they must all be occupied with their own offices and works, nor can one intrude on that of another?&#160; Could the kingdom of men then be propagated and increased by the king of the gods?</p>
