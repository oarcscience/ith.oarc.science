<p class="c21"><a name="v.iv.xi-p2"></A>11.&#160; But of this we should have been wholly incapable, had not Wisdom condescended to adapt Himself to our weakness, and to show us a pattern of holy life in the form of our own humanity.&#160; Yet, since we when we come to Him do wisely, He when He came to us was considered by proud men to have done very foolishly.&#160; And since we when we come to Him become strong, He when He came to us was looked upon as weak.&#160; But &#8220;the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1723"></A><A HREF="#fn_1723"><FONT SIZE="1">1724</FONT></A>
&#160; And thus, though Wisdom was Himself our home, He made Himself also the way by which we should reach our home.</p>
