<span id="v.vi.xxv-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—The Same Word Does Not Always
Signify the Same Thing.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxv-p2"></span>And when it is shown to be figurative, the
words in which it is expressed will be found to be drawn either from
like objects or from objects having some affinity.

<span id="v.vi.xxv-p3"></span>35.  But as there are many ways in which
things show a likeness to each other, we are not to suppose there is any
rule that what a thing signifies by similitude in one place it is to be
taken to signify in all other places.  For our Lord used leaven both in
a bad sense, as when He said, “Beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees,” <span id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880) and in a good
sense, as when He said, “The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven,
which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was
leavened.” <span id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881)

<span id="v.vi.xxv-p6"></span>36.  Now the rule in regard to this
variation has two forms.  For things that signify now one thing and now
another, signify either things that are contrary, or things that are
only different.  They signify contraries, for example, when they are
used metaphorically at one time in a good sense, at another in a bad, as
in the case of the leaven mentioned above.  Another example of the same
is that a lion stands for Christ in the place where it is said, “The
lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed;” <span
id="fr_1882"></span>[1883](#fn_1882) and again, stands for the devil
where it is written, “Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion,
walketh about seeking whom he may devour.” <span
id="fr_1883"></span>[1884](#fn_1883)   In the same way the serpent is
used in a good sense, “Be wise as serpents;” <span
id="fr_1884"></span>[1885](#fn_1884) and again, in a bad sense, “The
serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty.” <span
id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885)   Bread is used in a good sense, “I
am the living bread which came down from heaven;” <span
id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886) in a bad, “Bread eaten in secret is
pleasant.” <span id="fr_1887"></span>[1888](#fn_1887)   And so in a
great many other cases.  The examples I have adduced are indeed by no
means doubtful in their signification, because only plain instances
ought to be used as examples.  There are passages, however, in regard to
which it is uncertain in what sense they ought to be taken, as for
example, “In the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: 
it is full of mixture.” <span id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888)   Now
it is uncertain whether this denotes the wrath of God, but not to the
last extremity of punishment, that is, “to the very dregs;” or whether
it denotes the grace of the Scriptures passing away from the Jews and
coming to the Gentiles, because “He has put down one and set up
another,”—certain observances, however, which they understand in a
carnal manner, still remaining among the Jews, for “the dregs hereof is
not yet wrung out.”  The following is an example of the same object
being taken, not in opposite, but only in different significations: 
water denotes people, as we read in the Apocalypse, <span
id="fr_1889"></span>[1890](#fn_1889) and also the Holy Spirit, as for
example, “Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water;” <span
id="fr_1890"></span>[1891](#fn_1890) and many other things besides water
must be interpreted according to the place in which they are found.

<span id="v.vi.xxv-p16"></span>37.  And in the same way other objects
are not single in their signification, but each one of them denotes not
two only but sometimes even several different things, according to the
connection in which it is found.
