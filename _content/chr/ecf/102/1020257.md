id="iv.IX.10-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—That, According to Plotinus, Men,
Whose Body is Mortal, are Less Wretched Than Demons, Whose Body is
Eternal.</span>

<span id="iv.IX.10-p2"></span>Plotinus, whose memory is quite
recent, <span id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347) enjoys the reputation of
having understood Plato better than any other of his disciples.  In
speaking of human souls, he says, “The Father in compassion made their
bonds mortal;” <span id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348) that is to say,
he considered it due to the Father’s mercy that men, having a mortal
body, should not be forever confined in the misery of this life.  But of
this mercy the demons have been judged unworthy, and they have received,
in conjunction with a soul subject to passions, a body not mortal like
man’s, but eternal.  For they should have been happier than men if they
had, like men, had a mortal body, and, like the gods, a blessed soul. 
And they should have been equal to men, if in conjunction with a
miserable soul they had at least received, like men, a mortal body, so
that death might have freed them from trouble, if, at least, they should
have attained some degree of piety.  But, as it is, they are not only no
happier than men, having, like them, a miserable soul, they are also
more wretched, being eternally bound to the body; for he does not leave
us to infer that by some progress in wisdom and piety they can become
gods, but expressly says that they are demons forever.
