<p class="c34"><a name="v.iv.i-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="v.iv.i-p1.1"></A>Chapter 1.&#8212;The Interpretation of Scripture Depends on the Discovery and Enunciation of the Meaning, and is to Be Undertaken in Dependence on God&#146;s Aid.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="v.iv.i-p2"></A>1.&#160; <span class="c20"><a name="v.iv.i-p2.1"></A>There</span> are two things on which all interpretation of Scripture depends:&#160; the mode of ascertaining the proper meaning, and the mode of making known the meaning when it is ascertained.&#160; We shall treat first of the mode of ascertaining, next of the mode of making known, the meaning;&#8212;a great and arduous undertaking, and one that, if difficult to carry out, it is, I fear, presumptuous to enter upon.&#160; And presumptuous it would undoubtedly be, if I were counting on my own strength; but since my hope of accomplishing the work rests on Him who has already supplied me with many thoughts on this subject, I do not fear but that He will go on to supply what is yet wanting when once I have begun to use what He has already given.&#160; For a possession which is not diminished by being shared with others, if it is possessed and not shared, is not yet possessed as it  <A NAME="page_523"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 523</FONT></A> <a name="v.iv.i-Page_523"></A>  ought to be possessed.&#160; The Lord saith &#8220;Whosoever hath, to him shall be given.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1716"></A><A HREF="#fn_1716"><FONT SIZE="1">1717</FONT></A>
&#160; He will give, then, to those who have; that is to say, if they use freely and cheerfully what they have received, He will add to and perfect His gifts.&#160; The loaves in the miracle were only five and seven in number before the disciples began to divide them among the hungry people.&#160; But when once they began to distribute them, though the wants of so many thousands were satisfied, they filled baskets with the fragments that were left.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1717"></A><A HREF="#fn_1717"><FONT SIZE="1">1718</FONT></A>
&#160; Now, just as that bread increased in the very act of breaking it, so those thoughts which the Lord has already vouchsafed to me with a view to undertaking this work will, as soon as I begin to impart them to others, be multiplied by His grace, so that, in this very work of distribution in which I have engaged, so far from incurring loss and poverty, I shall be made to rejoice in a marvellous increase of wealth.</p>
