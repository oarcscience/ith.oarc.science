<p class="c21"><a name="v.v.xxxii-p2"></A>50.&#160; And yet the validity of logical sequences is not a thing devised by men, but is observed and noted by them that they may be able to learn and teach it; for it exists eternally in the reason of things, and has its origin with God.&#160; For as the man who narrates the order of events does not himself create that order; and as he who describes the situations of places, or the natures of animals, or roots, or minerals, does not describe arrangements of man; and as he who points out the stars and their movements does not point out anything that he himself or any other man has ordained;&#8212;in the same way, he who says, &#8220;When the consequent is false, the antecedent must also be false,&#8221; says what is most true; but he does not himself make it so, he only points out that it is so.&#160; And it is upon this rule that the reasoning I have quoted from the Apostle Paul proceeds.&#160; For the antecedent is, &#8220;There is no resurrection of the dead,&#8221;&#8212;the position taken up by those whose error the apostle wished to overthrow.&#160; Next, from this antecedent, the assertion, viz., that there is no resurrection of the dead, the necessary consequence is, &#8220;Then Christ is not risen.&#8221;&#160; But this consequence is false, for Christ has risen; therefore the antecedent is also false.&#160; But the antecedent is, that there is no resurrection of the dead.&#160; We conclude, therefore, that there is a resurrection of the dead.&#160; Now all this is briefly expressed thus:&#160; If there is no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen; but Christ is risen, therefore there is a resurrection of the dead.&#160; This rule, then, that when the consequent is removed, the antecedent must also be removed, is not made by man, but only pointed out by him.&#160; And this rule has reference to the validity of the reasoning, not to the truth of the statements.</p>
