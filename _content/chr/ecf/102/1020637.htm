<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XXI.4-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XXI.4-p1.1"></A>Chapter 4.&#8212;Examples from Nature Proving that Bodies May Remain Unconsumed and Alive in Fire.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XXI.4-p2"></A>If, therefore, the salamander lives in fire, as naturalists&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1498"></A><A HREF="#fn_1498"><FONT SIZE="1">1499</FONT></A>
 have recorded, and if certain famous mountains of Sicily have been continually on fire from the remotest antiquity until now, and yet remain entire, these are sufficiently convincing examples that everything which burns is not consumed.&#160; As the soul too, is a proof that not everything which can suffer pain can also die, why then do they yet demand that we produce real examples to prove that it is not incredible that the bodies of men condemned to everlasting punishment may retain their soul in the fire, may burn without being consumed, and may suffer without perishing?&#160; For suitable properties will be communicated to the substance of the flesh by Him who has endowed the things we see with so marvellous and diverse properties, that their very multitude prevents our wonder.&#160; For who but God the Creator of all things has given to the flesh of the peacock its antiseptic property?&#160; This property, when I first heard of it, seemed to me incredible; but it happened at Carthage that a bird of this kind was cooked and served up to me, and, taking a suitable slice of flesh from its breast, I ordered it to be kept, and when it had been kept as many days as make any other flesh stinking, it was produced and set before me, and emitted no offensive smell.&#160; And after it had been laid by for thirty days and more, it was still in the same state; and a year after, the same still, except that it was a little more shrivelled, and drier.&#160; Who gave to chaff such power to freeze that it preserves snow buried under it, and such power to warm that it ripens green fruit?</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XXI.4-p4"></A>But who can explain the strange properties of fire itself, which blackens everything it burns, though itself bright; and which, though of the most beautiful colors, discolors almost all it touches and feeds upon, and turns blazing fuel into grimy cinders?&#160; Still this is not laid down as an absolutely uniform law; for, on the contrary, stones baked in glowing fire themselves also glow, and though the fire be rather of a red hue, and they white, yet white is congruous with light, and black with darkness.&#160; Thus, though the fire burns the wood in calcining the stones, these contrary effects do not result from the contrariety of the materials.&#160; For though wood and stone differ, they are not contraries, like black and white, the one of which colors is produced in the stones, while the other is produced in the wood by the same action of fire, which imparts its own brightness to the former, while it begrimes the latter, and which could have no effect on the one were it not fed by the other.&#160; Then what wonderful properties do we find in charcoal, which is so brittle that a light tap breaks it and a slight pressure pulverizes it, and yet is so strong that no moisture rots it, nor any time causes it to decay.&#160; So enduring is it, that it is customary in laying down landmarks to put charcoal underneath them, so that if, after the longest interval, any one raises an action, and pleads that there is no boundary stone, he may be convicted by the charcoal below.&#160; What then has enabled it to last so long without rotting, though buried in the damp earth in which [its original] wood rots, except this same fire which consumes all things?</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XXI.4-p5"></A>Again, let us consider the wonders of lime; for besides growing white in fire, which makes other things black, and of which I have already said enough, it has also a mysterious property of conceiving fire within it.&#160; Itself cold to the touch, it yet has a hidden store of fire, which is not at once apparent to our senses, but which experience teaches us, lies as it were slumbering within it even while unseen.&#160; And it is for this reason called &#8220;quick lime,&#8221; as if the fire were the invisible soul quickening the visible substance or body.&#160; But the marvellous thing is, that this fire is kindled when it is extinguished.&#160; For to disengage the hidden fire the lime is moistened or drenched with water, and then, though it be cold before, it becomes hot by that very application which cools what is hot.&#160; As if the  <A NAME="page_455"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 455</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XXI.4-Page_455"></A>  fire were departing from the lime and breathing its last, it no longer lies hid, but appears; and then the lime lying in the coldness of death cannot be requickened, and what we before called &#8220;quick,&#8221; we now call &#8220;slaked.&#8221;&#160; What can be stranger than this?&#160; Yet there is a greater marvel still.&#160; For if you treat the lime, not with water, but with oil, which is as fuel to fire, no amount of oil will heat it.&#160; Now if this marvel had been told us of some Indian mineral which we had no opportunity of experimenting upon, we should either have forthwith pronounced it a falsehood, or certainly should have been greatly astonished.&#160; But things that daily present themselves to our own observation we despise, not because they are really less marvellous, but because they are common; so that even some products of India itself, remote as it is from ourselves, cease to excite our admiration as soon as we can admire them at our leisure.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1499"></A><A HREF="#fn_1499"><FONT SIZE="1">1500</FONT></A>

<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XXI.4-p12"></A>The diamond is a stone possessed by many among ourselves, especially by jewellers and lapidaries, and the stone is so hard that it can be wrought neither by iron nor fire, nor, they say, by anything at all except goat&#146;s blood.&#160; But do you suppose it is as much admired by those who own it and are familiar with its properties as by those to whom it is shown for the first time?&#160; Persons who have not seen it perhaps do not believe what is said of it, or if they do, they wonder as at a thing beyond their experience; and if they happen to see it, still they marvel because they are unused to it, but gradually familiar experience [of it] dulls their admiration.&#160; We know that the loadstone has a wonderful power of attracting iron.&#160; When I first saw it I was thunderstruck, for I saw an iron ring attracted and suspended by the stone; and then, as if it had communicated its own property to the iron it attracted, and had made it a substance like itself, this ring was put near another, and lifted it up; and as the first ring clung to the magnet, so did the second ring to the first.&#160; A third and a fourth were similarly added, so that there hung from the stone a kind of chain of rings, with their hoops connected, not interlinking, but attached together by their outer surface.&#160; Who would not be amazed at this virtue of the stone, subsisting as it does not only in itself, but transmitted through so many suspended rings, and binding them together by invisible links?&#160; Yet far more astonishing is what I heard about this stone from my brother in the episcopate, Severus bishop of Milevis.&#160; He told me that Bathanarius, once count of Africa, when the bishop was dining with him, produced a magnet, and held it under a silver plate on which he placed a bit of iron; then as he moved his hand with the magnet underneath the plate, the iron upon the plate moved about accordingly.&#160; The intervening silver was not affected at all, but precisely as the magnet was moved backwards and forwards below it, no matter how quickly, so was the iron attracted above.&#160; I have related what I myself have witnessed; I have related what I was told by one whom I trust as I trust my own eyes.&#160; Let me further say what I have read about this magnet.&#160; When a diamond is laid near it, it does not lift iron; or if it has already lifted it, as soon as the diamond approaches, it drops it.&#160; These stones come from India.&#160; But if we cease to admire them because they are now familiar, how much less must they admire them who procure them very easily and send them to us?&#160; Perhaps they are held as cheap as we hold lime, which, because it is common, we think nothing of, though it has the strange property of burning when water, which is wont to quench fire, is poured on it, and of remaining cool when mixed with oil, which ordinarily feeds fire.</p>
