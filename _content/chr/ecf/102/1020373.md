id="iv.XIII.6-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Of the Evil of Death in General,
Considered as the Separation of Soul and Body.</span>

<span id="iv.XIII.6-p2"></span>Wherefore, as regards bodily death, that
is, the separation of the soul from the body, it is good unto none while
it is being endured by those whom we say are in the article of death. 
For the very violence with which body and soul are wrenched asunder,
which in the living had been conjoined and closely intertwined, brings
with it a harsh experience, jarring horridly on nature so long as it
continues, till there comes a total loss of sensation, which arose from
the very interpenetration of spirit and flesh.  And all this anguish is
sometimes forestalled by one stroke of the body or sudden flitting of
the soul, the swiftness of which prevents it from being felt.  But
whatever that may be in the dying which with violently painful sensation
robs of all sensation, yet, when it is piously and faithfully borne, it
increases the merit of patience, but does not make the name of
punishment inapplicable.  Death, proceeding by ordinary generation from
the first man, is the punishment of all who are born of him, yet, if it
be endured for righteousness’ sake, it becomes the <span
id="page_248">p. 248</span> <span id="iv.XIII.6-Page_248"></span> glory
of those who are born again; and though death be the award of sin, it
sometimes secures that nothing be awarded to sin.
