id="v.IV_1.15-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—The Christian Teacher Should Pray
Before Preaching.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.15-p2"></span>32.  And so our Christian orator, while
he says what is just, and holy, and good (and he ought never to say
anything else), does all he can to be heard with intelligence, with
pleasure, and with obedience; and he need not doubt that if he succeed
in this object, <span id="page_585">p. 585</span> <span
id="v.IV_1.15-Page_585"></span> and so far as he succeeds, he will
succeed more by piety in prayer than by gifts of oratory; and so he
ought to pray for himself, and for those he is about to address, before
he attempts to speak.  And when the hour is come that he must speak, he
ought, before he opens his mouth, to lift up his thirsty soul to God, to
drink in what he is about to pour forth, and to be himself filled with
what he is about to distribute.  For, as in regard to every matter of
faith and love there are many things that may be said, and many ways of
saying them, who knows what it is expedient at a given moment for us to
say, or to be heard saying, except God who knows the hearts of all?  And
who can make us say what we ought, and in the way we ought, except Him
in whose hand both we and our speeches are?  Accordingly, he who is
anxious both to know and to teach should learn all that is to be taught,
and acquire such a faculty of speech as is suitable for a divine.  But
when the hour for speech arrives, let him reflect upon that saying of
our Lord’s as better suited to the wants of a pious mind:  “Take no
thought how or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you in that
same hour what ye shall speak.  For it is not ye that speak, but the
Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.” <span
id="fr_1957"></span>[1958](#fn_1957)   The Holy Spirit, then, speaks
thus in those who for Christ’s sake are delivered to the persecutors;
why not also in those who deliver Christ’s message to those who are
willing to learn?
