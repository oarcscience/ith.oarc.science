<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XXII.24-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XXII.24-p1.1"></A>Chapter 24.&#8212;Of the Blessings with Which the Creator Has Filled This Life, Obnoxious Though It Be to the Curse.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XXII.24-p2"></A>But we must now contemplate the rich and countless blessings with which the goodness of God, who cares for all He has created, has filled this very misery of the human race, which reflects His retributive justice.&#160; That first blessing which He pronounced before the fall, when He said, &#8220;Increase, and multiply, and replenish the earth,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1657"></A><A HREF="#fn_1657"><FONT SIZE="1">1658</FONT></A>
&#160; He did not inhibit after man had sinned, but the fecundity originally bestowed remained in the condemned stock; and the vice of sin, which has involved us in the necessity of dying, has yet not deprived us of that wonderful power of seed, or rather of that still more marvellous power by which seed is produced, and which seems to be as it were inwrought and inwoven in the human body.&#160; But in this river, as I may call it, or torrent of the human race, both elements are carried along together,&#8212;both the evil which is derived from him who begets, and the good which is bestowed by Him who creates us.&#160; In the original evil there are two things, sin and punishment; in the original good, there are two other things, propagation and conformation.&#160; But of the evils, of which the one, sin, arose from our audacity, and the other, punishment, from God&#146;s judgment, we have already said as much as suits our present purpose.&#160; I mean now to speak of the blessings which God has conferred or still confers upon our nature, vitiated and condemned as it is.&#160; For in condemning it He did not withdraw all that He had given it, else it had been annihilated; neither did He, in penally subjecting it to the devil, remove it beyond His own power; for not even the devil himself is outside of God&#146;s government, since the devil&#146;s nature subsists only by the supreme Creator who gives being to all that in any form exists.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XXII.24-p4"></A>Of these two blessings, then, which we have said flow from God&#146;s goodness, as from a fountain, towards our nature, vitiated by sin and condemned to punishment, the one, propagation, was conferred by God&#146;s benediction when He made those first works, from which He rested on the seventh day.&#160; But the other, conformation, is conferred in that work of His wherein &#8220;He worketh hitherto.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1658"></A><A HREF="#fn_1658"><FONT SIZE="1">1659</FONT></A>
&#160; For were He to withdraw His efficacious power from things, they should neither be able to go on and complete the periods assigned to their measured movements, nor should they even continue in possession of that nature they were created in.&#160; God, then, so created man that He gave him what we may call fertility, whereby he might propagate other men, giving them a congenital capacity to propagate their kind, but not imposing on them any necessity to do so.&#160; This capacity God withdraws at pleasure from individuals, making them barren; but from the whole race He has not withdrawn the blessing of propagation once conferred.&#160; But though not withdrawn on account of sin, this power of propagation is not what it would have been had there been no sin.&#160; For since &#8220;man placed in honor fell, he has become like the beasts,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1659"></A><A HREF="#fn_1659"><FONT SIZE="1">1660</FONT></A>
 and generates as they do, though the little spark of reason, which was the image of God in him, has not been quite quenched.&#160; But if conformation were not added to propagation, there would be no reproduction of one&#146;s kind.&#160; For even though there were no such thing as copulation, and God wished to fill the earth with human inhabitants, He might create all these as He created one without the help of human generation.&#160; And, indeed, even as it is, those who copulate can generate nothing save by the creative energy of God.&#160; As, therefore, in respect of that spiritual growth whereby a man is formed to piety and righteousness, the apostle says, &#8220;Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1660"></A><A HREF="#fn_1660"><FONT SIZE="1">1661</FONT></A>
 so also it must be said that it is not he that generates that is anything, but God that giveth the essential form; that it is not the mother who carries and nurses the fruit of her womb that is anything, but God that giveth the increase.&#160; For He alone, by that energy wherewith &#8220;He worketh hitherto,&#8221; causes the seed to develop, and to evolve from certain secret and invisible folds into the visible forms of beauty which we see.&#160; He alone, coupling and connecting in some wonderful fashion the spiritual and corporeal natures, the one to command, the other to obey, makes a living being.&#160; And this work of His is so great and wonderful, that not only man, who is a rational animal, and consequently more excellent than all other animals of the earth, but even the most diminutive insect, cannot be considered attentively without astonishment and without praising the Creator.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XXII.24-p8"></A>It is He, then, who has given to the human soul a mind, in which reason and understanding lie as it were asleep during infancy, and as if they were not, destined, however, to be awakened and exercised as years increase, so as to become capable of knowledge and of receiving instruction, fit to understand what is true and to love what is good.&#160; It is by this capacity the soul drinks in wisdom, and  <A NAME="page_503"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 503</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XXII.24-Page_503"></A>  becomes endowed with those virtues by which, in prudence, fortitude, temperance, and righteousness, it makes war upon error and the other inborn vices, and conquers them by fixing its desires upon no other object than the supreme and unchangeable Good.&#160; And even though this be not uniformly the result, yet who can competently utter or even conceive the grandeur of this work of the Almighty, and the unspeakable boon He has conferred upon our rational nature, by giving us even the capacity of such attainment?&#160; For over and above those arts which are called virtues, and which teach us how we may spend our life well, and attain to endless happiness,&#8212;arts which are given to the children of the promise and the kingdom by the sole grace of God which is in Christ,&#8212;has not the genius of man invented and applied countless astonishing arts, partly the result of necessity, partly the result of exuberant invention, so that this vigor of mind, which is so active in the discovery not merely of superfluous but even of dangerous and destructive things, betokens an inexhaustible wealth in the nature which can invent, learn, or employ such arts?&#160; What wonderful&#8212;one might say stupefying&#8212;advances has human industry made in the arts of weaving and building, of agriculture and navigation!&#160; With what endless variety are designs in pottery, painting, and sculpture produced, and with what skill executed!&#160; What wonderful spectacles are exhibited in the theatres, which those who have not seen them cannot credit!&#160; How skillful the contrivances for catching, killing, or taming wild beasts!&#160; And for the injury of men, also, how many kinds of poisons, weapons, engines of destruction, have been invented, while for the preservation or restoration of health the appliances and remedies are infinite!&#160; To provoke appetite and please the palate, what a variety of seasonings have been concocted!&#160; To express and gain entrance for thoughts, what a multitude and variety of signs there are, among which speaking and writing hold the first place! what ornaments has eloquence at command to delight the mind! what wealth of song is there to captivate the ear! how many musical instruments and strains of harmony have been devised!&#160; What skill has been attained in measures and numbers! with what sagacity have the movements and connections of the stars been discovered!&#160; Who could tell the thought that has been spent upon nature, even though, despairing of recounting it in detail, he endeavored only to give a general view of it?&#160; In fine, even the defence of errors and misapprehensions, which has illustrated the genius of heretics and philosophers, cannot be sufficiently declared.&#160; For at present it is the nature of the human mind which adorns this mortal life which we are extolling, and not the faith and the way of truth which lead to immortality.&#160; And since this great nature has certainly been created by the true and supreme God, who administers all things He has made with absolute power and justice, it could never have fallen into these miseries, nor have gone out of them to miseries eternal, &#8212;saving only those who are redeemed,&#8212;had not an exceeding great sin been found in the first man from whom the rest have sprung.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XXII.24-p9"></A>Moreover, even in the body, though it dies like that of the beasts, and is in many ways weaker than theirs, what goodness of God, what providence of the great Creator, is apparent!&#160; The organs of sense and the rest of the members, are not they so placed, the appearance, and form, and stature of the body as a whole, is it not so fashioned, as to indicate that it was made for the service of a reasonable soul?&#160; Man has not been created stooping towards the earth, like the irrational animals; but his bodily form, erect and looking heavenwards, admonishes him to mind the things that are above.&#160; Then the marvellous nimbleness which has been given to the tongue and the hands, fitting them to speak, and write, and execute so many duties, and practise so many arts, does it not prove the excellence of the soul for which such an assistant was provided?&#160; And even apart from its adaptation to the work required of it, there is such a symmetry in its various parts, and so beautiful a proportion maintained, that one is at a loss to decide whether, in creating the body, greater regard was paid to utility or to beauty.&#160; Assuredly no part of the body has been created for the sake of utility which does not also contribute something to its beauty.&#160; And this would be all the more apparent, if we knew more precisely how all its parts are connected and adapted to one another, and were not limited in our observations to what appears on the surface; for as to what is covered up and hidden from our view, the intricate web of veins and nerves, the vital parts of all that lies under the skin, no one can discover it.&#160; For although, with a cruel zeal for science, some medical men, who are called anatomists, have dissected the bodies of the dead, and sometimes even of sick persons who died under their knives, and have inhumanly pried into the secrets of the human body to learn the nature of the disease and its exact seat, and how it might be cured, yet those relations of which I speak, and which form the concord,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1661"></A><A HREF="#fn_1661"><FONT SIZE="1">1662</FONT></A>
  <A NAME="page_504"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 504</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XXII.24-Page_504"></A>  or, as the Greeks call it, &#8220;harmony,&#8221; of the whole body outside and in, as of some instrument, no one has been able to discover, because no one has been audacious enough to seek for them.&#160; But if these could be known, then even the inward parts, which seem to have no beauty, would so delight us with their exquisite fitness, as to afford a profounder satisfaction to the mind&#8212;and the eyes are but its ministers&#8212;than the obvious beauty which gratifies the eye.&#160; There are some things, too, which have such a place in the body, that they obviously serve no useful purpose, but are solely for beauty, as <i>e.g</i>. the teats on a man&#146;s breast, or the beard on his face; for that this is for ornament, and not for protection, is proved by the bare faces of women, who ought rather, as the weaker sex, to enjoy such a defence.&#160; If, therefore, of all those members which are exposed to our view, there is certainly not one in which beauty is sacrificed to utility, while there are some which serve no purpose but only beauty, I think it can readily be concluded that in the creation of the human body comeliness was more regarded than necessity.&#160; In truth, necessity is a transitory thing; and the time is coming when we shall enjoy one another&#146;s beauty without any lust,&#8212;a condition which will specially redound to the praise of the Creator, who, as it is said in the psalm, has &#8220;put on praise and comeliness.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1662"></A><A HREF="#fn_1662"><FONT SIZE="1">1663</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XXII.24-p12"></A>How can I tell of the rest of creation, with all its beauty and utility, which the divine goodness has given to man to please his eye and serve his purposes, condemned though he is, and hurled into these labors and miseries?&#160; Shall I speak of the manifold and various loveliness of sky, and earth, and sea; of the plentiful supply and wonderful qualities of the light; of sun, moon, and stars; of the shade of trees; of the colors and perfume of flowers; of the multitude of birds, all differing in plumage and in song; of the variety of animals, of which the smallest in size are often the most wonderful,&#8212;the works of ants and bees astonishing us more than the huge bodies of whales?&#160; Shall I speak of the sea, which itself is so grand a spectacle, when it arrays itself as it were in vestures of various colors, now running through every shade of green, and again becoming purple or blue?&#160; Is it not delightful to look at it in storm, and experience the soothing complacency which it inspires, by suggesting that we ourselves are not tossed and shipwrecked?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1663"></A><A HREF="#fn_1663"><FONT SIZE="1">1664</FONT></A>
&#160; What shall I say of the numberless kinds of food to alleviate hunger, and the variety of seasonings to stimulate appetite which are scattered everywhere by nature, and for which we are not indebted to the art of cookery?&#160; How many natural appliances are there for preserving and restoring health!&#160; How grateful is the alternation of day and night! how pleasant the breezes that cool the air! how abundant the supply of clothing furnished us by trees and animals!&#160; Who can enumerate all the blessings we enjoy? &#160;If I were to attempt to detail and unfold only these few which I have indicated in the mass, such an enumeration would fill a volume.&#160; And all these are but the solace of the wretched and condemned, not the rewards of the blessed.&#160; What then shall these rewards be, if such be the blessings of a condemned state?&#160; What will He give to those whom He has predestined to life, who has given such things even to those whom He has predestined to death?&#160; What blessings will He in the blessed life shower upon those for whom, even in this state of misery, He has been willing that His only-begotten Son should endure such sufferings even to death?&#160; Thus the apostle reasons concerning those who are predestined to that kingdom:&#160; &#8220;He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also give us all things?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1664"></A><A HREF="#fn_1664"><FONT SIZE="1">1665</FONT></A>
&#160; When this promise is fulfilled, what shall we be?&#160; What blessings shall we receive in that kingdom, since already we have received as the pledge of them Christ&#146;s dying?&#160; In what condition shall the spirit of man be, when it has no longer any vice at all; when it neither yields to any, nor is in bondage to any, nor has to make war against any, but is perfected, and enjoys undisturbed peace with itself?&#160; Shall it not then know all things with certainty, and without any labor or error, when unhindered and joyfully it drinks the wisdom of God at the fountain-head?&#160; What shall the body be, when it is in every respect subject to the spirit, from which it shall draw a life so sufficient, as to stand in need of no other nutriment?&#160; For it shall no longer be animal, but spiritual, having indeed the substance of flesh, but without any fleshly corruption.</p>
