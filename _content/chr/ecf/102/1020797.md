<span id="v.vi.xvii-p2"></span>25.  Again, it often happens that a man
who has attained, or thinks he has attained, to a higher grade of
spiritual life, thinks that the commands given to those who are still in
the lower grades are figurative; for example, if he has embraced a life
of celibacy and made himself a eunuch for the kingdom of heaven’s sake,
he contends that the commands given in Scripture about loving and ruling
a wife are not to be taken literally, but figuratively; and if he has
determined to keep his virgin unmarried, he tries to put a figurative
interpretation on the passage where it is said, “Marry thy daughter, and
so shall thou have performed a weighty matter.” <span

for understanding the Scriptures will be as follows,—to recognize that
some commands are given to all in common, others to particular classes
of persons, that the medicine may act not only upon the state of health
as a whole, but also upon the special weakness of each member.  For that
which cannot be raised to a higher state must be cared for in its own
state.
