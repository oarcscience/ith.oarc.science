<span id="iv.V.15-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.V.15-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—Concerning the Temporal Reward
Which God Granted to the Virtues of the Romans.</span>

<span id="iv.V.15-p2"></span>Now, therefore, with regard to those to
whom God did not purpose to give eternal life with His holy angels in
His own celestial city, to the society of which that true piety which
does not render the service of religion, which the Greeks call <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.V.15-p2.1"></span> λατρεία</span>, to any
save the true God conducts, if He had also withheld from them the
terrestrial glory of that most excellent empire, a reward would not have
been rendered to their good arts,—that is, their virtues,—by which they
sought to attain so great glory.  For as to those who seem to do some
good that they may receive glory from men, the Lord also says, “Verily I
say unto you, they have received their reward.” <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215)   So also these despised their own
private affairs for the sake of the republic, and for its treasury
resisted avarice, consulted for the good of their country with a spirit
of freedom, addicted neither to what their laws pronounced to be crime
nor to lust.  By all these acts, as by the true way, they pressed
forward to honors, power, and glory; they were honored among almost all
nations; they imposed the laws of their empire upon many nations; and at
this day, both in literature and history, they are glorious among almost
all nations.  There is no reason why they should complain against the
justice of the supreme and true God,—“they have received their reward.”
