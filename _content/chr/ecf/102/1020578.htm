<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XIX.5-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XIX.5-p1.1"></A>Chapter 5.&#8212;Of the Social Life, Which, Though Most Desirable, is Frequently Disturbed by Many Distresses.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XIX.5-p2"></A>We give a much more unlimited approval to their idea that the life of the wise man must be social.&#160; For how could the city of God (concerning which we are already writing no less than the nineteenth book of this work)  <A NAME="page_404"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 404</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XIX.5-Page_404"></A>  either take a beginning or be developed, or attain its proper destiny, if the life of the saints were not a social life?&#160; But who can enumerate all the great grievances with which human society abounds in the misery of this mortal state?&#160; Who can weigh them?&#160; Hear how one of their comic writers makes one of his characters express the common feelings of all men in this matter:&#160; &#8220;I am married; this is one misery.&#160; Children are born to me; they are additional cares.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1268"></A><A HREF="#fn_1268"><FONT SIZE="1">1269</FONT></A>
&#160; What shall I say of the miseries of love which Terence also recounts&#8212;&#8220;slights, suspicions, quarrels, war to-day, peace to-morrow?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1269"></A><A HREF="#fn_1269"><FONT SIZE="1">1270</FONT></A>
&#160; Is not human life full of such things?&#160; Do they not often occur even in honorable friendships?&#160; On all hands we experience these slights, suspicions, quarrels, war, all of which are undoubted evils; while, on the other hand, peace is a doubtful good, because we do not know the heart of our friend, and though we did know it to-day, we should be as ignorant of what it might be to-morrow.&#160; Who ought to be, or who are more friendly than those who live in the same family?&#160; And yet who can rely even upon this friendship, seeing that secret treachery has often broken it up, and produced enmity as bitter as the amity was sweet, or seemed sweet by the most perfect dissimulation?&#160; It is on this account that the words of Cicero so move the heart of every one, and provoke a sigh:&#160; &#8220;There are no snares more dangerous than those which lurk under the guise of duty or the name of relationship.&#160; For the man who is your declared foe you can easily baffle by precaution; but this hidden, intestine, and domestic danger not merely exists, but overwhelms you before you can foresee and examine it.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1270"></A><A HREF="#fn_1270"><FONT SIZE="1">1271</FONT></A>
&#160; It is also to this that allusion is made by the divine saying, &#8220;A man&#146;s foes are those of his own household,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1271"></A><A HREF="#fn_1271"><FONT SIZE="1">1272</FONT></A>
&#8212;words which one cannot hear without pain; for though a man have sufficient fortitude to endure it with equanimity, and sufficient sagacity to baffle the malice of a pretended friend, yet if he himself is a good man, he cannot but be greatly pained at the discovery of the perfidy of wicked men, whether they have always been wicked and merely feigned goodness, or have fallen from a better to a malicious disposition.&#160; If, then, home, the natural refuge from the ills of life, is itself not safe, what shall we say of the city, which, as it is larger, is so much the more filled with lawsuits civil and criminal, and is never free from the fear, if sometimes from the actual outbreak, of disturbing and bloody insurrections and civil wars?</p>
