<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XIV.14-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XIV.14-p1.1"></A>Chapter 14.&#8212;Of the Pride in the Sin, Which Was Worse Than the Sin Itself.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XIV.14-p2"></A>But it is a worse and more damnable pride which casts about for the shelter of an excuse even in manifest sins, as these our first parents did, of whom the woman said, &#8220;The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat;&#8221; and the man said, &#8220;The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_736"></A><A HREF="#fn_736"><FONT SIZE="1">737</FONT></A>
&#160; Here there is no word of begging pardon, no word of entreaty for healing.&#160; For though they do not, like Cain, deny that they have perpetrated the deed, yet their pride seeks to refer its wickedness to another,&#8212;the woman&#146;s pride to the serpent, the man&#146;s to the woman.&#160; But where there is a plain trangression of a divine commandment, this is rather to accuse than to excuse oneself.&#160; For the fact that the woman sinned on the serpent&#146;s persuasion, and the man at the woman&#146;s offer, did not make the transgression less, as if there were any one whom we ought rather to believe or yield to than God.</p>
