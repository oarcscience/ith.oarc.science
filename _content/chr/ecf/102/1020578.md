<span id="iv.XIX.5-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIX.5-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—Of the Social Life, Which, Though
Most Desirable, is Frequently Disturbed by Many Distresses.</span>

<span id="iv.XIX.5-p2"></span>We give a much more unlimited approval to
their idea that the life of the wise man must be social.  For how could
the city of God (concerning which we are already writing no less than
the nineteenth book of this work) <span id="page_404">p. 404</span>
<span id="iv.XIX.5-Page_404"></span> either take a beginning or be
developed, or attain its proper destiny, if the life of the saints were
not a social life?  But who can enumerate all the great grievances with
which human society abounds in the misery of this mortal state?  Who can
weigh them?  Hear how one of their comic writers makes one of his
characters express the common feelings of all men in this matter:  “I am
married; this is one misery.  Children are born to me; they are
additional cares.” <span id="fr_1268"></span>[1269](#fn_1268)   What
shall I say of the miseries of love which Terence also
recounts—“slights, suspicions, quarrels, war to-day, peace
to-morrow?” <span id="fr_1269"></span>[1270](#fn_1269)   Is not human
life full of such things?  Do they not often occur even in honorable
friendships?  On all hands we experience these slights, suspicions,
quarrels, war, all of which are undoubted evils; while, on the other
hand, peace is a doubtful good, because we do not know the heart of our
friend, and though we did know it to-day, we should be as ignorant of
what it might be to-morrow.  Who ought to be, or who are more friendly
than those who live in the same family?  And yet who can rely even upon
this friendship, seeing that secret treachery has often broken it up,
and produced enmity as bitter as the amity was sweet, or seemed sweet by
the most perfect dissimulation?  It is on this account that the words of
Cicero so move the heart of every one, and provoke a sigh:  “There are
no snares more dangerous than those which lurk under the guise of duty
or the name of relationship.  For the man who is your declared foe you
can easily baffle by precaution; but this hidden, intestine, and
domestic danger not merely exists, but overwhelms you before you can
foresee and examine it.” <span id="fr_1270"></span>[1271](#fn_1270)   It
is also to this that allusion is made by the divine saying, “A man’s
foes are those of his own household,” <span
id="fr_1271"></span>[1272](#fn_1271) —words which one cannot hear
without pain; for though a man have sufficient fortitude to endure it
with equanimity, and sufficient sagacity to baffle the malice of a
pretended friend, yet if he himself is a good man, he cannot but be
greatly pained at the discovery of the perfidy of wicked men, whether
they have always been wicked and merely feigned goodness, or have fallen
from a better to a malicious disposition.  If, then, home, the natural
refuge from the ills of life, is itself not safe, what shall we say of
the city, which, as it is larger, is so much the more filled with
lawsuits civil and criminal, and is never free from the fear, if
sometimes from the actual outbreak, of disturbing and bloody
insurrections and civil wars?
