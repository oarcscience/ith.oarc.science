<p class="c21"><a name="iv.II_1.15-p2"></A>But is it not manifest that vanity rather than reason regulated the choice of some of their false gods?&#160; This Plato, whom they reckon a demigod, and who used all his eloquence to preserve men from the most dangerous spiritual calamities, has yet not been counted worthy even of a little shrine; but Romulus, because they can call him their own, they have esteemed more highly than many gods, though their secret doctrine can allow him the rank only of a demigod.&#160; To him they allotted a flamen, that is to say, a priest of a class so highly esteemed in their religion (distinguished, too, by their conical mitres), that for only three of their gods were flamens appointed,&#8212;the Flamen Dialis for Jupiter, Martialis for Mars, and Quirinalis for Romulus (for when the ardor of his fellow-citizens had given Romulus a seat among the gods, they gave him this new name Quirinus).&#160; And thus by this honor Romulus has been preferred to Neptune and Pluto, Jupiter&#146;s brothers, and to Saturn himself, their father.&#160; They have assigned the same priesthood to serve him as to serve Jove; and in giving Mars (the reputed father of Romulus) the same honor, is this not rather for Romulus&#146; sake than to honor Mars?</p>
