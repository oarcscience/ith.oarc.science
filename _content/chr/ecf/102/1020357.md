<span id="iv.XII.18-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XII.18-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—Against Those Who Assert that
Things that are Infinite <span id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554) Cannot
Be Comprehended by the Knowledge of God.</span>

<span id="iv.XII.18-p3"></span>As for their other assertion, that God’s
knowledge cannot comprehend things infinite, it only remains for them to
affirm, in order that they may sound the depths of their impiety, that
God does not know all numbers.  For it is very certain that they are
infinite; since, no matter of what number you suppose an end to be made,
this number can be, I will not say, increased by the addition of one
more, but however great it be, and however vast be the multitude of
which it is the rational and scientific expression, it can still be not
only doubled, but even multiplied.  Moreover, each number is so defined
by its own properties, that no two numbers are equal.  They are
therefore both unequal and different from one another; and while they
are simply finite, collectively they are infinite.  Does God, therefore,
not know numbers on account of this infinity; and does His knowledge
extend only to a certain height in numbers, while of the rest He is
ignorant?  Who is so left to himself as to say so?  Yet they can hardly
pretend to put numbers out of the question, or maintain that they have
nothing to do with the knowledge of God; for Plato, <span
id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555) their great authority, represents God
as framing the world on numerical principles:  and in our books also it
is said to God, “Thou hast ordered all things in number, and measure,
and weight.” <span id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556)   The prophet also
says,” Who bringeth out their host by number.” <span
id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557)   And the Saviour says in the Gospel,
“The very hairs of your head are all numbered.” <span
id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558)   Far be it, then, from us to doubt
that all number is known to Him “whose understanding,” according to the
Psalmist, “is infinite.” <span id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559)   The
infinity of number, though there be no numbering of infinite numbers, is
yet not incomprehensible by Him whose understanding is infinite.  And
thus, if everything which is comprehended is defined or made finite by
the comprehension of him who knows it, then all infinity is in some
ineffable way made finite to God, for it is comprehensible by His
knowledge.  Wherefore, if the infinity of numbers cannot be infinite to
the knowledge of God, by which it is comprehended, what are we poor
creatures that we should presume to fix limits to His knowledge, and say
that unless the same temporal thing be repeated by the same periodic
revolutions, God cannot either foreknow His creatures that He may make
them, or know them when He has made them?  God, whose knowledge is
simply manifold, and uniform in its variety, comprehends all
incomprehensibles with so incomprehensible a comprehension, that though
He willed always to make His later works novel and unlike what went
before them, He could not produce them without order and foresight, nor
conceive them suddenly, but by His eternal foreknowledge.
