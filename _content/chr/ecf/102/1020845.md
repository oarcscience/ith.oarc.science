<span id="v.IV_1.27-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.IV_1.27-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—The Man Whose Life is in Harmony
with His Teaching Will Teach with Greater Effect.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.27-p2"></span>59.  But whatever may be the majesty of
the style, the life of the speaker will count for more in securing the
hearer’s compliance.  The man who speaks wisely and eloquently, but
lives wickedly, may, it is true, instruct many who are anxious to learn;
though, as it is written, he “is unprofitable to himself.” <span
id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008)   Wherefore, also, the apostle
says:  “Whether in pretence or in truth Christ is preached.” <span
id="fr_2009"></span>[2010](#fn_2009)   Now Christ is the truth; yet we
see that the truth can be preached, though not in truth,—that is, what
is right and true in itself may be preached by a man of perverse and
deceitful mind.  And thus it is that Jesus Christ is preached by those
that seek their own, and not the things that are Jesus Christ’s.  But
since true believers obey the voice, not of any man, but of the Lord
Himself, who says, “All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that
observe and do:  but do not ye after their works; for they say and do
not;” <span id="fr_2010"></span>[2011](#fn_2010) therefore it is that
men who themselves lead unprofitable lives are heard with profit by
others.  For though they seek their own objects, they do not dare to
teach their own doctrines, sitting as they do in the high places of
ecclesiastical authority, which is established on sound doctrine. 
Wherefore our Lord Himself, before saying what I have just quoted about
men of this stamp, made this observation:  “The scribes and the
Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat.” <span
id="fr_2011"></span>[2012](#fn_2011)   The seat they occupied, then,
which was not theirs but Moses’, compelled them to say what was good,
though they did what was evil.  And so they followed their own course in
their lives, but were prevented by the seat they occupied, which
belonged to another, from preaching their own doctrines.

<span id="v.IV_1.27-p7"></span>60.  Now these men do good to many by
preaching what they themselves do not perform; but they would do good to
very many <span id="page_596">p. 596</span> <span
id="v.IV_1.27-Page_596"></span> more if they lived as they preach.  For
there are numbers who seek an excuse for their own evil lives in
comparing the teaching with the conduct of their instructors, and who
say in their hearts, or even go a little further, and say with their
lips:  Why do you not do yourself what you bid me do?  And thus they
cease to listen with submission to a man who does not listen to himself,
and in despising the preacher they learn to despise the word that is
preached.  Wherefore the apostle, writing to Timothy, after telling him,
“Let no man despise thy youth,” adds immediately the course by which he
would avoid contempt:  “but be thou an example of the believers, in
word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in
purity.” <span id="fr_2012"></span>[2013](#fn_2012)
