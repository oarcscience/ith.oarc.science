id="iv.XVIII.6-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Who Were Kings of Argos, and of
Assyria, When Jacob Died in Egypt.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.6-p2"></span>Apis, then, who died in Egypt, was not
the king of Egypt, but of Argos.  He was succeeded by his son Argus,
from whose name the land was called Argos and the people Argives, for
under the earlier kings neither the place nor the nation as yet had this
name.  While he then reigned over Argos, and Eratus over Sicyon, and
Balæus still remained king of Assyria, Jacob died in Egypt a hundred and
forty-seven years old, after he had, when dying, blessed his sons and
his grandsons by Joseph, and prophesied most plainly of Christ, saying
in the blessing of Judah, “A prince shall not fail out of Judah, nor a
leader from his thighs, until those things come which are laid up for
him; and He is the expectation of the nations.” <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[1136](#fn_1135)   In the reign of Argus, Greece
began to use fruits, and to have crops of corn in cultivated fields, the
seed having been brought from other countries.  Argus also began to be
accounted a god after his death, and was honored with a temple and
sacrifices.  This honor was conferred in his reign, before being given
to him, on a private individual for being the first to yoke oxen in the
plough.  This was one Homogyrus, who was struck by lightning.
