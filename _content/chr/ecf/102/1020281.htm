<p class="c21"><a name="iv.X.10-p2"></A>But here we have another and a much more learned Platonist than Apuleius, Porphyry, to wit, asserting that, by I know not what theurgy, even the gods themselves are subjected to passions and perturbations; for by adjurations they were so bound and terrified that they could not confer purity of soul,&#8212;were so terrified by him who imposed on them a wicked command, that they could not by the same theurgy be freed from that terror, and fulfill the righteous behest of him who prayed to them, or do the good he sought.&#160; Who does not see that all these things are fictions of deceiving demons, unless he be a wretched slave of theirs, and an alien from the grace of the true Liberator?&#160; For if the Chald&aelig;an had been dealing with good gods, certainly a well-disposed man, who sought to purify his own soul, would have had more influence with them than an evil-disposed man seeking to hinder him.&#160; Or, if the gods were just, and considered the man unworthy of the purification he sought, at all events they should not have been terrified by an envious person, nor hindered, as Porphyry avows, by the fear of a stronger deity, but should have simply denied the boon on their own free judgment.&#160; And it is surprising that that well-disposed Chald&aelig;an, who desired to purify his soul by theurgical rites, found no superior deity who could either terrify the frightened gods still more, and force them to confer the boon, or compose their fears, and so enable them to do good without compulsion,&#8212;even supposing that the good theurgist had no rites by which he himself might purge away the taint of fear from the gods whom he invoked for the purification of his own soul.&#160; And why is it that there is a god who has power to terrify the inferior gods, and none who has power to free them from fear?&#160; Is there found a god who listens to the envious man, and frightens the  <A NAME="page_187"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 187</FONT></A> <a name="iv.X.10-Page_187"></A>  gods from doing good? and is there not found a god who listens to the well-disposed man, and removes the fear of the gods that they may do him good?&#160; O excellent theurgy!&#160; O admirable purification of the soul!&#8212;a theurgy in which the violence of an impure envy has more influence than the entreaty of purity and holiness.&#160; Rather let us abominate and avoid the deceit of such wicked spirits, and listen to sound doctrine.&#160; As to those who perform these filthy cleansings by sacrilegious rites, and see in their initiated state (as he further tells us, though we may question this vision) certain wonderfully lovely appearances of angels or gods, this is what the apostle refers to when he speaks of &#8220;Satan transforming himself into an angel of light.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_403"></A><A HREF="#fn_403"><FONT SIZE="1">404</FONT></A>
&#160; For these are the delusive appearances of that spirit who longs to entangle wretched souls in the deceptive worship of many and false gods, and to turn them aside from the true worship of the true God, by whom alone they are cleansed and healed, and who, as was said of Proteus, &#8220;turns himself into all shapes,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_404"></A><A HREF="#fn_404"><FONT SIZE="1">405</FONT></A>
 equally hurtful, whether he assaults us as an enemy, or assumes the disguise of a friend.</p>
