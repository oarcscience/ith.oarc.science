<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XVIII.12-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XVIII.12-p1.1"></A>Chapter 12.&#8212;Of the Rituals of False Gods Instituted by the Kings of Greece in the Period from Israel&#146;s Exodus from Egypt Down to the Death of Joshua the Son of Nun.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVIII.12-p2"></A>During this period, that is, from Israel&#146;s exodus from Egypt down to the death of Joshua the son of Nun, through whom that people received the land of promise, rituals were instituted to the false gods by the kings of Greece, which, by stated celebration, recalled the memory of the flood, and of men&#146;s deliverance from it, and of that troublous life they then led in migrating to and fro between the heights and the plains.&#160; For even the Luperci,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1138"></A><A HREF="#fn_1138"><FONT SIZE="1">1139</FONT></A>
 when they ascend and descend the sacred path, are said to represent the men who sought the mountain summits because of the inundation of water, and returned to the lowlands on its subsidence.&#160; In those times, Dionysus, who was also called Father Liber, and was esteemed a god after death, is said to have shown the vine to his host in Attica.&#160; Then the musical games were instituted for the Delphic Apollo, to appease his anger,  <A NAME="page_367"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 367</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XVIII.12-Page_367"></A>  through which they thought the regions of Greece were afflicted with barrenness, because they had not defended his temple which Danaos burnt when he invaded those lands; for they were warned by his oracle to institute these games.&#160; But king Ericthonius first instituted games to him in Attica, and not to him only, but also to Minerva, in which games the olive was given as the prize to the victors, because they relate that Minerva was the discoverer of that fruit, as Liber was of the grape.&#160; In those years Europa is alleged to have been carried off by Xanthus king of Crete (to whom we find some give another name), and to have borne him Rhadamanthus, Sarpedon, and Minos, who are more commonly reported to have been the sons of Jupiter by the same woman.&#160; Now those who worship such gods regard what we have said about Xanthus king of Crete as true history; but this about Jupiter, which the poets sing, the theatres applaud, and the people celebrate, as empty fable got up as a reason for games to appease the deities, even with the false ascription of crimes to them.&#160; In those times Hercules was held in honor in Tyre, but that was not the same one as he whom we spoke of above.&#160; In the more secret history there are said to have been several who were called Father Liber and Hercules.&#160; This Hercules, whose great deeds are reckoned as twelve (not including the slaughter of Ant&aelig;us the African, because that affair pertains to another Hercules), is declared in their books to have burned himself on Mount &#338;ta, because he was not able, by that strength with which he had subdued monsters, to endure the disease under which he languished.&#160; At that time the king, or rather tyrant Busiris, who is alleged to have been the son of Neptune by Libya the daughter of Epaphus, is said to have offered up his guests in sacrifice to the gods.&#160; Now it must not be believed that Neptune committed this adultery, lest the gods should be criminated; yet such things must be ascribed to them by the poets and in the theatres, that they may be pleased with them.&#160; Vulcan and Minerva are said to have been the parents of Ericthonius king of Athens, in whose last years Joshua the son of Nun is found to have died.&#160; But since they will have it that Minerva is a virgin, they say that Vulcan, being disturbed in the struggle between them, poured out his seed into the earth, and on that account the man born of it received that name; for in the Greek language <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.XVIII.12-p3.1"></A>&#7956;&#961;&#953;&#962;</span> is &#8220;strife,&#8221; and  <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.XVIII.12-p3.2"></A>&#967;&#952;&#8060;&#957;</span> &#8220;earth,&#8221; of which two words Ericthonius is a compound.&#160; Yet it must be admitted that the more learned disprove and disown such things concerning their gods, and declare that this fabulous belief originated in the fact that in the temple at Athens, which Vulcan and Minerva had in common, a boy who had been exposed was found wrapped up in the coils of a dragon, which signified that he would become great, and, as his parents were unknown, he was called the son of Vulcan and Minerva, because they had the temple in common.&#160; Yet that fable accounts for the origin of his name better than this history.&#160; But what does it matter to us?&#160; Let the one in books that speak the truth edify religious men, and the other in lying fables delight impure demons.&#160; Yet these religious men worship them as gods.&#160; Still, while they deny these things concerning them they cannot clear them of all crime, because at their demand they exhibit plays in which the very things they wisely deny are basely done, and the gods are appeased by these false and base things.&#160; Now, even although the play celebrates an unreal crime of the gods, yet to delight in the ascription of an unreal crime is a real one.</p>
