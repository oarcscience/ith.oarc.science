<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XI.19-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XI.19-p1.1"></A>Chapter 19.&#8212;What, Seemingly, We are to Understand by the Words, &#8220;God Divided the Light from the Darkness.&#8221;</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XI.19-p2"></A>Accordingly, though the obscurity of the divine word has certainly this advantage, that it causes many opinions about the truth to be started and discussed, each reader seeing some fresh meaning in it, yet, whatever is said to be meant by an obscure passage should be either confirmed by the testimony of obvious facts, or should be asserted in other and less ambiguous texts.&#160; This obscurity is beneficial, whether the sense of the author is at last reached after the discussion of many other interpretations, or whether, though that sense remain concealed, other truths are brought out by the discussion of the obscurity. &#160;To me it does not seem incongruous with the working of God, if we understand that the angels were created when that first light was made, and that a separation was made between the holy and the unclean angels, when, as is said, &#8220;God divided the light from the darkness; and God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night.&#8221;&#160; For He alone could make this discrimination, who was able also before they fell, to foreknow that they would fall, and that, being deprived of the light of truth, they would abide in the darkness of pride.&#160; For, so far as regards the day and night, with which we are familiar, He commanded those luminaries of heaven that are obvious to our senses to divide between the light and the darkness.&#160; &#8220;Let there be,&#8221; He says, &#8220;lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night;&#8221; and shortly after He says, &#8220;And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night:&#160; the stars also.&#160; And God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_490"></A><A HREF="#fn_490"><FONT SIZE="1">491</FONT></A>
&#160; But between that light, which is the holy company of the angels spiritually radiant with the illumination of the truth, and that opposing darkness, which is the noisome foulness of the spiritual condition of those angels who are turned away from the light of righteousness, only He Himself could divide, from whom their wickedness (not of nature, but of will), while yet it was future, could not be hidden or uncertain.</p>
