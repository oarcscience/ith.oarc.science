<p class="c21"><a name="iv.X.15-p2"></A>And so it has pleased Divine Providence, as I have said, and as we read in the Acts of the Apostles,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_408"></A><A HREF="#fn_408"><FONT SIZE="1">409</FONT></A>
 that the law enjoining the worship of one God should be given by the disposition of angels.&#160; But among them the person of God Himself visibly appeared, not, indeed, in His proper substance, which ever remains invisible to mortal eyes, but by the infallible signs furnished by creation in obedience to its Creator.&#160; He made use, too, of the words of human speech, uttering them syllable by syllable successively, though in His own nature He speaks not in a bodily but in a spiritual way; not to sense, but to the mind; not in words that occupy time, but, if I may so say, eternally, neither beginning to speak nor coming to an end.&#160; And what He says is accurately heard, not by the bodily but by the mental ear of His ministers and messengers, who are immortally blessed in the enjoyment of His unchangeable truth; and the directions which they in some ineffable way receive, they execute without delay or difficulty in the sensible and visible world.&#160; And this law was given in conformity with the age of the world, and contained at the first earthly promises, as I have said, which, however, symbolized eternal ones; and these eternal blessings few understood, though many took a part in the celebration of their visible signs.&#160; Nevertheless, with one consent both the words and the visible rites of that law enjoin the worship of one God,&#8212;not one of a crowd of gods, but Him who made heaven and earth, and every soul and every spirit which is other than Himself.&#160; He created; all else was created; and, both for being and well-being, all things need Him who created them.</p>
