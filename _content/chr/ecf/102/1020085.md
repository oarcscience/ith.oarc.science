<span id="iv.III.12-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.III.12-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—That the Romans Added a Vast
Number of Gods to Those Introduced by Numa, and that Their Numbers
Helped Them Not at All.</span>

<span id="iv.III.12-p2"></span>But though Pompilius introduced so ample
a ritual, yet did not Rome see fit to be content with it.  For as yet
Jupiter himself had not his chief temple,—it being King Tarquin who
built the Capitol.  And Æsculapius left Epidaurus for Rome, that in this
foremost city he might have a finer field for the exercise of his great
medical skill. <span id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137)   The mother of
the gods, too, came I know not whence from Pessinuns; it being unseemly
that, while her son presided on the Capitoline hill, she herself should
lie hid in obscurity.  But if she is the mother of all the gods, she not
only followed some of her children to Rome, but left others to follow
her.  I wonder, indeed, if she were the mother of Cynocephalus, who a
long while afterwards came from Egypt.  Whether also the goddess Fever
was her offspring, is a matter for her grandson Æsculapius <span
id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138) to decide.  But of whatever breed she
be, the foreign gods will not presume, I trust, to call a goddess
base-born who is a Roman citizen.  Who can number the deities to whom
the guardianship of Rome was entrusted?  Indigenous and imported, both
of heaven, earth, hell, seas, fountains, rivers; and, as Varro says,
gods certain and uncertain, male and female:  for, as among animals, so
among all kinds of gods are there these distinctions.  Rome, then,
enjoying the protection of such a cloud of deities, might surely have
been preserved from some of those great and horrible calamities, of
which I can mention but a few.  For by the great smoke of her altars she
summoned to her protection, as by a beacon-fire, a host of gods, for
whom she appointed and maintained temples, altars, sacrifices, priests,
and thus offended the true and most high God, to whom alone all this
ceremonial is lawfully due.  And, indeed, she was more prosperous when
she had fewer gods; but the greater she became, the more gods she
thought she should have, as the larger ship needs to be manned by a
larger crew.  I suppose she despaired of the smaller number, under whose
protection she had spent comparatively happy days, being able to defend
her greatness.  For even under the kings (with the exception of Numa
Pompilius, of whom I have already spoken), how wicked a contentiousness
must have existed to occasion the death of Romulus’ brother!
