<p class="c34"><a name="iv.II_1.4-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.II_1.4-p1.1"></A>Chapter 4.&#8212;That the Worshippers of the Gods Never Received from Them Any Healthy Moral Precepts, and that in Celebrating Their Worship All Sorts of Impurities Were Practiced.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.II_1.4-p2"></A>First of all, we would ask why their gods took no steps to improve the morals of their worshippers.&#160; That the true God should neglect those who did not seek His help, that was but justice; but why did those gods, from whose worship ungrateful men are now complaining that they are prohibited, issue no laws which might have guided their devotees to a virtuous life?&#160; Surely it was but just, that such care as men showed to the worship  <A NAME="page_25"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 25</FONT></A> <a name="iv.II_1.4-Page_25"></A>  of the gods, the gods on their part should have to the conduct of men.&#160; But, it is replied, it is by his own will a man goes astray.&#160; Who denies it?&#160; But none the less was it incumbent on these gods, who were men&#146;s guardians, to publish in plain terms the laws of a good life, and not to conceal them from their worshippers.&#160; It was their part to send prophets to reach and convict such as broke these laws, and publicly to proclaim the punishments which await evil-doers, and the rewards which may be looked for by those that do well.&#160; Did ever the walls of any of their temples echo to any such warning voice?&#160; I myself, when I was a young man, used sometimes to go to the sacrilegious entertainments and spectacles; I saw the priests raving in religious excitement, and heard the choristers; I took pleasure in the shameful games which were celebrated in honor of gods and goddesses, of the virgin C&#339;lestis,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">90</FONT></A>
 and Berecynthia,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">91</FONT></A>
 the mother of all the gods.&#160; And on the holy day consecrated to her purification, there were sung before her couch productions so obscene and filthy for the ear&#8212;I do not say of the mother of the gods, but of the mother of any senator or honest man&#8212;nay, so impure, that not even the mother of the foul-mouthed players themselves could have formed one of the audience.&#160; For natural reverence for parents is a bond which the most abandoned cannot ignore.&#160; And, accordingly, the lewd actions and filthy words with which these players honored the mother of the gods, in presence of a vast assemblage and audience of both sexes, they could not for very shame have rehearsed at home in presence of their own mothers.&#160; And the crowds that were gathered from all quarters by curiosity, offended modesty must, I should suppose, have scattered in the confusion of shame.&#160; If these are sacred rites, what is sacrilege?&#160; If this is purification, what is pollution?&#160; This festivity was called the Tables,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">92</FONT></A>
 as if a banquet were being given at which unclean devils might find suitable refreshment.&#160; For it is not difficult to see what kind of spirits they must be who are delighted with such obscenities, unless, indeed, a man be blinded by these evil spirits passing themselves off under the name of gods, and either disbelieves in their existence, or leads such a life as prompts him rather to propitiate and fear them than the true God.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.II_1.4-p3"></A> Tertullian (<i>Apol.</i> c. 24) mentions C&#339;lestis as specially worshipped in Africa.&#160; Augustin mentions her again in the 26th chapter of this book, and in other parts of his works.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.II_1.4-p4"></A> Berecynthia is one of the many names of Rhea or Cybele.&#160; Livy (xxix. 11) relates that the image of Cybele was brought to Rome the day before the ides of April, which was accordingly dedicated as her feast-day.&#160; The image, it seems, had to be washed in the stream Almon, a tributary of the Tiber, before being placed in the temple of Victory; and each year, as the festival returned, the washing was repeated with much pomp at the same spot.&#160; Hence Lucan&#146;s line (i. 600), <i>Et lotam parvo revocant Almone Cybelen,</i> and the elegant verses of Ovid. <i> Fast</i>. iv. 337 et seq.</p>
