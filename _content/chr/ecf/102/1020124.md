id="iv.IV.19-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—Concerning Fortuna
Muliebris. <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173) </span>

<span id="iv.IV.19-p3"></span>To this supposed deity, whom they call
Fortuna, they ascribe so much, indeed, that they have a tradition that
the image of her, which was dedicated by the Roman matrons, <span
id="page_74">p. 74</span> <span id="iv.IV.19-Page_74"></span> and called
Fortuna Muliebris, has spoken, and has said, once and again, that the
matrons pleased her by their homage; which, indeed, if it is true, ought
not to excite our wonder.  For it is not so difficult for malignant
demons to deceive, and they ought the rather to advert to their wits and
wiles, because it is that goddess who comes by haphazard who has spoken,
and not she who comes to reward merit.  For Fortuna was loquacious, and
Felicitas mute; and for what other reason but that men might not care to
live rightly, having made Fortuna their friend, who could make them
fortunate without any good desert?  And truly, if Fortuna speaks, she
should at least speak, not with a womanly, but with a manly voice; lest
they themselves who have dedicated the image should think so great a
miracle has been wrought by feminine loquacity.
