id="v.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—The Word Was Made Flesh.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xiii-p2"></span>In what way did He come but this, “The
Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us”? <span
id="fr_1726"></span>[1727](#fn_1726)   Just as when we speak, in order
that what we have in our minds may enter through the ear into the mind
of the hearer, the word which we have in our hearts becomes an outward
sound and is called speech; and yet our thought does not lose itself in
the sound, but remains complete in itself, and takes the form of speech
without being modified in its own nature by the change:  so the Divine
Word, though suffering no change of nature, yet became flesh, that He
might dwell among us.
