<span id="iv.VII.32-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VII.32-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32.—That at No Time in the Past Was
the Mystery of Christ’s Redemption Awanting, But Was at All Times
Declared, Though in Various Forms.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.32-p2"></span>This mystery of eternal life, even from
the beginning of the human race, was, by certain signs and sacraments
suitable to the times, announced through angels to those to whom it was
meet.  Then the Hebrew people was congregated into one republic, as it
were, to <span id="page_141">p. 141</span> <span
id="iv.VII.32-Page_141"></span> perform this mystery; and in that
republic was foretold, sometimes through men who understood what they
spake, and sometimes through men who understood not, all that had
transpired since the advent of Christ until now, and all that will
transpire.  This same nation, too, was afterwards dispersed through the
nations, in order to testify to the scriptures in which eternal
salvation in Christ had been declared.  For not only the prophecies
which are contained in words, nor only the precepts for the right
conduct of life, which teach morals and piety, and are contained in the
sacred writings,—not only these, but also the rites, priesthood,
tabernacle or temple, altars, sacrifices, ceremonies, and whatever else
belongs to that service which is due to God, and which in Greek is
properly called <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.VII.32-p2.1"></span>λατρεία</span>,—all these signified and
fore-announced those things which we who believe in Jesus Christ unto
eternal life believe to have been fulfilled, or behold in process of
fulfillment, or confidently believe shall yet be fulfilled.
