<span id="iii.ii-p3"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ii-p3.1"></span>St. Chrysostom’s</span> Commentary on the
Epistle to the Galatians is continuous, according to chapter and verse,
instead of being arranged in Homilies, with a moral or practical
application at their close, as in his exposition of other Epistles. It
was written in Antioch, as Montfaucon infers from a reference which the
Author, makes upon Chap. i., ver. 16 (p. 20) to other of his writings,
which certainly were written about the same time in that city. Vid.
*Hom. de Mutal. Nom*., Tom. III., p. 98, Ed. Ben. The year is uncertain,
but seems not to have been earlier than <span class="c16"><span
id="iii.ii-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> 395.

<span id="iii.ii-p4"></span>The Homilies on the Epistle to the Ephesians
have been by some critics assigned to the Episcopate at Constantinople,
in consequence of certain imperfections in their composition, which
seemed to argue absence of the comparative leisure which he enjoyed at
Antioch. There is a passage too in Homily XI., pp. 231, 232, which
certainly is very apposite to the Author’s circumstance in the court of
Eudoxia. Yet there are strong reasons for deciding that they too were
delivered at Antioch. St. Babylas and St. Julian, both saints at
Antioch, are mentioned familiarly, the former in Homily IX., p. 205, the
latter in Homily XXI., pp. 342, 343. Monastic establishments in
mountains in the neighborhood are spoken of in Homily VI., p. 165, and
XIII., p. 248; <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2) and those near Antioch
are famous in St. Chrysostom’s history. A schism too is alluded to in
Homily XI., p. 230, as existing in the community he was addressing, and
that not about a question of doctrine; circumstances which are
accurately fulfilled in the contemporary history of Antioch, and which
are more or less noticed in the Homilies on 1 Corinthians, which were
certainly delivered at Antioch. <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3)

<span id="iii.ii-p7"></span>Moreover, he makes mention of the prevalence
of superstitions, Gentile and Jewish, among the people whom he was
addressing, in Homily VI., fin., p. 166, Homily XII., fin., p. 240,
which is a frequent ground of complaint in his other writings against
the Christians of Antioch: *vid.* in Gal. p. 15; in 1 Cor., Homily XII.,
§§ 13, 14; in Col., Homily VIII., fin.; *Contr. Jud.* I., pp. 386–388.

<span id="iii.ii-p8"></span>Since Evagrius, the last Bishop of the Latin
succession in the schism, died in <span class="c16"><span
id="iii.ii-p8.1"></span>a.d.</span> 392, these Homilies must have been
composed before that date.

<span id="iii.ii-p9"></span>As to the Translations, the Editors have
been favored with the former by a friend who conceals his name; and with
the latter, by the Rev. William John Copeland, M.A., Fellow of Trinity
College, Oxford.
