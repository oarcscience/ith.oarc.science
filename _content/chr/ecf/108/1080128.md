<span id="ii.CXVII-p3"></span>1. “O praise the Lord, all ye heathen:
praise Him, all ye nations” ([Psa.
117.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001)<span
id="ii.CXVII-p3.1"></span>). These are the courts of the Lord’s house,
this all His people, <span id="page_557">p. 557</span> <span
id="ii.CXVII-Page_557"></span>this the true Jerusalem. Let those rather
listen who have refused to be the children of this city, since they have
cut themselves off from the communion of all nations. <span
id="fr_5098"></span>[5099](#fn_5098) “For His merciful kindness is ever
more and more towards us: and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever”
([Psa. 117.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#002)<span
id="ii.CXVII-p4.1"></span>). These are those two things, loving-kindness
and truth, which in the <span class="c21"><span
id="ii.CXVII-p4.2"></span> CXV</span>th Psalm I admonished you should be
committed to memory. But “the merciful kindness of the Lord is ever more
and more towards us,” since the furious tongues of hostile nations have
yielded to His Name, through which we have been freed: “and the truth of
the Lord endureth for ever,” whether in those things which He promised
to the righteous, or in those which He hath threatened to the ungodly.
