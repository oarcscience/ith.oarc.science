<span id="ii.XXIX-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XXIX-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XXIX-p1.2"></span>Psalm XXIX. <span
id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662) </span>

<span id="ii.XXIX-p3"></span>A psalm of David himself, of the
consummation of the tabernacle.

<span id="ii.XXIX-p4"></span>1. A Psalm of the Mediator Himself, strong
of hand, of the perfection of the Church in this world, where she wars
in time against the devil.

<span id="ii.XXIX-p5"></span>2. The Prophet speaks, “Bring unto the
Lord, O ye Sons of God, bring unto the Lord the young of rams” ([Psa.
29.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001)<span id="ii.XXIX-p5.1"></span>).
Bring unto the Lord yourselves, whom the Apostles, the leaders of the
flocks, have begotten by the Gospel. <span
id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663) “Bring unto the Lord glory and honour”
([Psa. 29.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002)<span
id="ii.XXIX-p6.2"></span>). By your works let the Lord be glorified and
honoured. “Bring unto the Lord glory to His name.” Let Him be made known
gloriously throughout the world. “Worship the Lord in His holy court.”
Worship the Lord in your heart enlarged and sanctified. For ye are His
regal holy habitation.

<span id="ii.XXIX-p7"></span>3. “The Voice of the Lord is upon the
waters” ([Psa. 29.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003)<span
id="ii.XXIX-p7.1"></span>). The Voice of Christ is upon the peoples.
“The God of majesty hath thundered.” The God of majesty, from the cloud
of the flesh, hath awfully preached repentance. “The Lord is upon many
waters.” The Lord Jesus Himself, after that He sent forth His Voice upon
the peoples, and struck them with awe, converted them to Himself, and
dwelt in them.

<span id="ii.XXIX-p8"></span>4. “The Voice of the Lord is in power”
([Psa. 29.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004)<span
id="ii.XXIX-p8.1"></span>). The Voice of the Lord now in them
themselves, making them powerful. “The Voice of the Lord is in great
might.” The Voice of the Lord working great things in them.

<span id="ii.XXIX-p9"></span>5. “The Voice of the Lord breaking the
cedars” ([Psa. 29.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005)<span
id="ii.XXIX-p9.1"></span>). The Voice of the Lord humbling the proud in
brokenness of heart. “The Lord shall break the cedars of Libanus.” The
Lord by repentance shall break them that are <span id="page_67">p.
67</span> <span id="ii.XXIX-Page_67"></span>lifted on high by the
splendour of earthly nobility, when to confound them He shall have
“chosen the base things of this world,” <span
id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664) in the which to display His Divinity.

<span id="ii.XXIX-p11"></span>6. “And shall bruise them as the calf of
Libanus” ([Psa. 29.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#006)<span
id="ii.XXIX-p11.1"></span>). And when their proud exaltation hath been
cut off, He will lay them low after the imitation of His Own humility,
who like a calf was led to slaughter <span
id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665) by the nobility of this world. “For
the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers agreed together against
the Lord, and against His Christ.” <span
id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666) “And the Beloved is as the young of
the unicorns.” For even He the Beloved, and the Only One of the Father,
“emptied Himself” of His glory; and was made man, <span
id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667) like a child of the Jews, that were
“ignorant of God’s righteousness,” <span
id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668) and proudly boasting of their own
righteousness as peculiarly theirs.

<span id="ii.XXIX-p16"></span>7. “The Voice of the Lord cutting short
the flame of fire” ([Psa. 29.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#007)<span
id="ii.XXIX-p16.1"></span>). The Voice of the Lord, without any harm to
Himself, passing through all the excited ardour of them that persecute
Him, or dividing the furious rage of His persecutors, so that some
should say, “Is not this haply the very Christ;” others, “Nay; but He
deceiveth the people:” <span id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669) and so
cutting short their mad tumult, as to pass some over into His love, and
leave others in their malice.

<span id="ii.XXIX-p18"></span>8. “The Voice of the Lord moving the
wilderness” ([Psa. 29.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#008)<span
id="ii.XXIX-p18.1"></span>). The Voice of the Lord moving to the faith
the Gentiles once “without hope, and without God in the world;” <span
id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670) where no prophet, no preacher of God’s
word, as it were, no man had dwelt. “And the Lord will move the desert
of Cades.” And then the Lord will cause the holy word of His Scriptures
to be fully known, which was abandoned by the Jews who understood it
not.

<span id="ii.XXIX-p20"></span>9. “The Voice of the Lord perfecting the
stags” <span id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671) ([Psa.
29.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009)<span id="ii.XXIX-p21.1"></span>).
For the Voice of the Lord hath first perfected them that overcame and
repelled the envenomed tongues. <span id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672)
“And will reveal the woods.” And then will He reveal to them the
darknesses of the Divine books, and the shadowy depths of the mysteries,
where they feed with freedom. “And in His temple doth every man speak of
His glory.” And in His Church all born again to an eternal hope praise
God, each for His own gift, which He hath received from the Holy Spirit.

<span id="ii.XXIX-p23"></span>10. “The Lord inhabiteth the deluge”
([Psa. 29.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010)<span
id="ii.XXIX-p23.1"></span>). The Lord therefore first inhabiteth the
deluge of this world in His Saints, kept safely in the Church, as in the
ark. “And the Lord shall sit a King for ever.” And afterward He will sit
reigning in them for ever.

<span id="ii.XXIX-p24"></span>11. “The Lord will give strength to His
people” <span id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673) ([Psa.
29.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#011)<span
id="ii.XXIX-p25.2"></span>). For the Lord will give strength to His
people fighting against the storms and whirlwinds of this world, for
peace in this world He hath not promised them. <span
id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674) “The Lord will bless His people in
peace.” And the same Lord will bless His people, affording them peace in
Himself; for, saith He, “My peace I give unto you, My peace I leave with
you.” <span id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675)
