<span id="ii.XXXII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XXXII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XXXII-p1.2"></span>Psalm XXXII. <span
id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690) </span>

<span id="ii.XXXII-p3"></span>To David himself; for understanding.

<span id="ii.XXXII-p4"></span>1. To David himself; for understanding; by
which it is understood that not by the merits of works, but by the grace
of God, man is delivered, confessing his sins.

<span id="ii.XXXII-p5"></span>2. “Blessed are they whose unrighteousness
is forgiven, and whose sins are covered” ([Psa.
32.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001)<span id="ii.XXXII-p5.1"></span>):
and whose sins are buried in oblivion. “Blessed is the man to whom the
Lord hath not imputed sin, nor is there guile in his mouth” ([Psa.
32.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002)<span id="ii.XXXII-p5.2"></span>):
nor has he in his mouth boastings of righteousness, when his conscience
is full of sins.

<span id="ii.XXXII-p6"></span>3. “Because I kept silence, my bones waxed
old:” because I made not with my mouth “confession unto
salvation,” <span id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691) all firmness in me
has grown old in infirmity. “Through my roaring all the day long” ([Psa.
32.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003)<span id="ii.XXXII-p7.2"></span>):
when I was ungodly and a blasphemer, crying against God, as though
defending and excusing my sins.

<span id="ii.XXXII-p8"></span>4. “Because day and night Thy Hand was
heavy upon me:” because, through the continual punishment of Thy
scourges, “I was turned in misery, while a thorn was fixed through me”
<span id="page_71">p. 71</span> <span
id="ii.XXXII-Page_71"></span>([Psa.
32.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004)<span id="ii.XXXII-p8.1"></span>):
I was made miserable by knowing my misery, being pricked with an evil
conscience.

<span id="ii.XXXII-p9"></span>5. “I acknowledged my sin, and my
unrighteousness have I not hid:” that is, my unrighteousness have I not
concealed. <span id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692) “I said, I will
confess against myself my unrighteousness to the Lord:” I said, I will
confess, not against God (as in my ungodly crying, when I kept silence),
but against myself, my unrighteousness to the Lord. “And Thou forgavest
the iniquity of my heart” ([Psa.
32.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005)<span
id="ii.XXXII-p10.1"></span>); hearing the word of confession in the
heart, before it was uttered with the voice.

<span id="ii.XXXII-p11"></span>6. “For this shall every one that is holy
pray unto Thee in an acceptable time:” for this wickedness of heart
shall every one that is righteous pray unto Thee. For not by their own
merits will they be holy, but by that acceptable time, that is, at His
coming, who redeemed us from sin. “Nevertheless in the flood of great
waters they shall not come nigh him” ([Psa.
32.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006)<span
id="ii.XXXII-p11.1"></span>): nevertheless, let none think, when the end
has come suddenly, as in the days of Noah, <span
id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693) that there remaineth a place of
confession, whereby he may draw nigh unto God.

<span id="ii.XXXII-p13"></span>7. “Thou art my refuge from the
pressures, which have compassed me about:” Thou art my refuge from the
pressure of my sins, which hath compassed my heart. “O Thou, my
Rejoicing, deliver me from them that compass me about” ([Psa.
32.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007)<span
id="ii.XXXII-p13.1"></span>): in Thee is my joy: deliver me from the
sorrow which my sins bring upon me.

<span id="ii.XXXII-p14"></span>8. *Diapsalma.* The answer of God: “I
will give thee understanding, and will set thee in the way in which thou
shalt go;” I will give thee understanding after confession, that thou
depart not from the way in which thou shouldest go; lest thou wish to be
in thine own power. “I will fix Mine Eyes upon thee” ([Psa.
32.8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008)<span
id="ii.XXXII-p14.1"></span>); so will make sure upon thee My Love.

<span id="ii.XXXII-p15"></span>9. “Be not ye like unto horse or mule,
which have no understanding:” and therefore would govern themselves. But
saith the Prophet, “Hold in their jaws with bit and bridle.” Do Thou
then, O God, unto them “that will not come nigh Thee” ([Psa.
32.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009)<span
id="ii.XXXII-p15.1"></span>), what man doth to horse and mule, that by
scourges Thou make them to bear Thy rule.

<span id="ii.XXXII-p16"></span>10. “Many are the scourges of the
sinner:” much is he scourged, who, confessing not his sins to God, would
be his own ruler. “But he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy compasseth
him about” ([Psa. 32.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010)<span
id="ii.XXXII-p16.1"></span>); but he that trusteth in the Lord, and
submitteth himself to His rule, mercy shall compass him about.

<span id="ii.XXXII-p17"></span>11. “Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye
righteous:” be glad, and rejoice, ye righteous, not in yourselves, but
in the Lord. “And glory, all ye that are right in heart” ([Psa.
32.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011)<span
id="ii.XXXII-p17.1"></span>): and glory in Him, all ye who understand
that it is right to be subject unto Him, that so ye may be placed above
all things beside.
