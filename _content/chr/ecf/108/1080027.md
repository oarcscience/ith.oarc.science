<span id="ii.XXIII-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XXIII-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XXIII-p1.2"></span>Psalm XXIII. <span
id="fr_614"></span>[615](#fn_614) </span>

<span id="ii.XXIII-p3"></span>A psalm of David himself.

<span id="ii.XXIII-p4"></span>1. The Church speaks to Christ: “The Lord
feedeth me, and I shall lack nothing” ([Psa.
23.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001)<span id="ii.XXIII-p4.1"></span>).
The Lord Jesus Christ is my Shepherd, “and I shall lack nothing.”

<span id="ii.XXIII-p5"></span>2. “In a place of pasture there hath He
placed me” ([Psa. 23.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002)<span
id="ii.XXIII-p5.1"></span>). In a place of fresh pasture, leading me to
faith, <span id="fr_615"></span>[616](#fn_615) there hath He placed me
to be nourished. “By the water of refreshing hath He brought me up.” By
the water of baptism, whereby they are refreshed who have lost health
and strength, hath He brought me up.

<span id="ii.XXIII-p7"></span>3. “He hath converted my soul: He hath led
me forth in the paths of righteousness, for His Name’s sake” ([Psa.
23.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#003)<span id="ii.XXIII-p7.1"></span>).
He hath brought me forth in the narrow ways, wherein few walk, of His
righteousness; not for my merit’s sake, but for His Name’s sake.

<span id="ii.XXIII-p8"></span>4. “Yea, though I walk in the midst of the
shadow of death” ([Psa. 23.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004)<span
id="ii.XXIII-p8.1"></span>). Yea, though I walk in the midst of this
life, which is the shadow of death. <span
id="fr_616"></span>[617](#fn_616) “I will fear no evil, for Thou art
with me.” I will fear no evil, for Thou dwellest in my heart by faith:
and Thou art now with me, that after the shadow of death I too may be
with Thee. “Thy rod and Thy staff, they have comforted me.” Thy
discipline, like a rod for a flock of sheep, and like a staff for
children of some size, and growing out of the natural into spiritual
life, they have not been grievous to me; rather have they comforted me:
because Thou art mindful of me.

<span id="ii.XXIII-p10"></span>5. “Thou hast prepared a table in my
sight, against them that trouble me” ([Psa.
23.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005)<span
id="ii.XXIII-p10.1"></span>). Now after the rod, whereby, whilst a
little one, and living the natural life, I was brought up among the
flock in the pastures; after that rod, I say, when I began to be under
the staff, Thou hast prepared a table in my sight, that I should no more
be fed as a babe with milk, <span id="fr_617"></span>[618](#fn_617) but
being older should take meat, strengthened against them that trouble me.
“Thou hast fattened my head with oil.” Thou hast gladdened my mind with
spiritual joy. “And Thy inebriating cup, how excellent is it!” And Thy
cup yielding forgetfulness of former vain delights, how excellent is it!

<span id="ii.XXIII-p12"></span>6. “And Thy mercy shall follow me all the
days of my life:” that is, as long as I live in this mortal life, not
Thine, but mine. “That I may <span id="page_61">p. 61</span> <span
id="ii.XXIII-Page_61"></span>dwell in the house of the Lord <span
id="fr_618"></span>[619](#fn_618) for length of days” ([Psa.
23.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006)<span
id="ii.XXIII-p13.1"></span>). Now Thy mercy shall follow me not here
only, but also that I may dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
