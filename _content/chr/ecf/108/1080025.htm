</span></p>  
<p class="c32"><a name="ii.XXI-p3"></A>To the end, a psalm of David himself.</p>  
<p class="c26"><a name="ii.XXI-p4"></A>1. The title is a familiar one; the Psalm is of Christ.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_584"></A><A HREF="#fn_584"><FONT SIZE="1">585</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="ii.XXI-p6"></A>2. &#8220;O Lord, the King shall rejoice in Thy strength&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001">Psa. 21.1</a><a name="ii.XXI-p6.1"></A>). O Lord, in Thy strength, whereby the Word was made flesh, the Man Christ Jesus shall rejoice. &#8220;And shall exult exceedingly in Thy salvation.&#8221; And in that, whereby Thou quickenest all things, shall exult exceedingly.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.XXI-p7"></A>3. &#8220;Thou hast given Him the desire of His soul&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#002">Psa. 21.2</a><a name="ii.XXI-p7.1"></A>). He desired to eat the Passover,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_585"></A><A HREF="#fn_585"><FONT SIZE="1">586</FONT></A>
 and to lay down His life when He would, and again when He would to take it; and Thou hast given it to Him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_586"></A><A HREF="#fn_586"><FONT SIZE="1">587</FONT></A>
 &#8220;And hast not deprived Him of the good pleasure of His lips.&#8221; &#8220;My peace,&#8221; saith He, &#8220;I leave with you:&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_587"></A><A HREF="#fn_587"><FONT SIZE="1">588</FONT></A>
 and it was done.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.XXI-p11"></A>4. &#8220;For Thou hast presented Him with the blessings of sweetness&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003">Psa. 21.3</a><a name="ii.XXI-p11.1"></A>). Because He had first quaffed the blessing of Thy sweetness, the gall of our sins did not hurt Him. &#8220;<i>Diapsalma</i>. Thou hast set a crown of precious stone on His Head.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_588"></A><A HREF="#fn_588"><FONT SIZE="1">589</FONT></A>
 At the beginning of His discoursing precious stones were brought, and compassed Him about;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_589"></A><A HREF="#fn_589"><FONT SIZE="1">590</FONT></A>
 His disciples, from whom the commencement of His preaching should be made.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.XXI-p14"></A>5. &#8220;He asked life; and Thou gavest Him:&#8221; He asked a resurrection, saying, &#8220;Father, glorify Thy Son;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_590"></A><A HREF="#fn_590"><FONT SIZE="1">591</FONT></A>
 and Thou gavest it Him, &#8220;Length of days for ever and ever&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004">Psa. 21.4</a><a name="ii.XXI-p15.2"></A>). The prolonged ages of this world which the Church was to have, and after them an eternity, world without end.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.XXI-p16"></A>6. &#8220;His glory is great in Thy salvation&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005">Psa. 21.5</a><a name="ii.XXI-p16.1"></A>). Great indeed is His glory in the salvation, whereby Thou hast raised Him up again. &#8220;Glory and great honour shalt Thou lay upon Him.&#8221; But Thou shalt yet add unto Him glory and great honour, when Thou shalt place Him in heaven at Thy right hand.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.XXI-p17"></A>7. &#8220;For Thou shalt give Him blessing for ever and ever.&#8221; This is the blessing which Thou shalt give Him for ever and ever: &#8220;Thou shalt make Him glad in joy together with Thy countenance&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006">Psa. 21.6</a><a name="ii.XXI-p17.1"></A>). According to His manhood, Thou shalt make Him glad together with Thy countenance, which He lifted up to Thee.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.XXI-p18"></A>8. &#8220;For the King hopeth in the Lord.&#8221; For the King is not proud, but humble in heart, he hopeth in the Lord. &#8220;And in the mercy of the Most Highest He shall not be moved&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#007">Psa. 21.7</a><a name="ii.XXI-p18.1"></A>). And in the mercy of the Most Highest His obedience even unto the death of the Cross shall not disturb His humility.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.XXI-p19"></A>9. &#8220;Let Thy hand be found by all Thine enemies.&#8221; Be Thy power, O King, when Thou comest to judgment, found by all Thine enemies; who in Thy humiliation discerned it not. &#8220;Let Thy right hand find out all that hate Thee&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008">Psa. 21.8</a><a name="ii.XXI-p19.1"></A>). Let the glory, wherein Thou reignest at the right hand of the Father, find out for punishment in the day of judgment all that hate Thee; for that now they have not found it.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.XXI-p20"></A>10. &#8220;Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven:&#8221; Thou shalt make them on fire within, by the consciousness of their ungodliness: &#8220;In the time of Thy countenance:&#8221; in the time of Thy manifestation. &#8220;The Lord shall trouble them in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009">Psa. 21.9</a><a name="ii.XXI-p20.1"></A>). And then, being troubled by the vengeance of the Lord, after the accusation of their conscience, they shall be given up to eternal  fire, to be devoured.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.XXI-p21"></A>11. &#8220;Their fruit shalt Thou destroy out of the earth.&#8221; Their fruit, because it is earthly, shalt Thou destroy out of the earth. &#8220;And their seed from the sons of men&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010">Psa. 21.10</a><a name="ii.XXI-p21.1"></A>). And their works; or, whomsoever they have seduced, Thou shalt not reckon among the sons of men, whom Thou hast called into the everlasting inheritance.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.XXI-p22"></A>12. &#8220;Because they turned evils against Thee.&#8221; Now this punishment shall be recompensed to them, because the evils which they supposed to hang over them by Thy reign, they turned against Thee to Thy death. &#8220;They imagined a <A NAME="page_58"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 58</FONT></A> <a name="ii.XXI-Page_58"></A>device, which they were not able to establish&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#011">Psa. 21.11</a><a name="ii.XXI-p22.1"></A>). They imagined a device, saying, &#8220;It is expedient that one die for all:&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_591"></A><A HREF="#fn_591"><FONT SIZE="1">592</FONT></A>
 which they were not able to establish, not knowing what they said.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.XXI-p24"></A>13. &#8220;For Thou shalt set them low.&#8221; For Thou shalt rank them among those from whom in degradation and contempt Thou wilt turn away. &#8220;In Thy leavings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_592"><FONT SIZE="1">593</FONT></A>
 Thou shalt make ready their countenance&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#012">Psa. 21.12</a><a name="ii.XXI-p25.1"></A>). And in these things that Thou leavest, that is, in the desires of an earthly kingdom, Thou shalt make ready their shamelessness for Thy passion.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.XXI-p26"></A>14. &#8220;Be Thou exalted, O Lord, in Thy strength&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#013">Psa. 21.13</a><a name="ii.XXI-p26.1"></A>). Be Thou, Lord, whom in humiliation they did not discern, exalted in Thy strength, which they thought weakness. &#8220;We will sing and praise Thy power.&#8221; In heart and in deed we will celebrate and make known Thy marvels.</p>
