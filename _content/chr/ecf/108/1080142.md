<span id="ii.CXIX.xii"></span>

<span id="ii.CXIX.xii-p1"></span> *<span class="c2"><span
id="ii.CXIX.xii-p1.1"></span>Lamed.</span>*

<span id="ii.CXIX.xii-p2"></span>89. The man who speaketh in this Psalm,
as if he were tired of human mutability, whence this life is full of
temptations, among his tribulations, on account of which he had above
said, “The wicked have persecuted me;” <span
id="fr_5254"></span>[5255](#fn_5254) and, “They have almost made an end
of me upon earth” <span id="fr_5255"></span>[5256](#fn_5255) ([Psa.
119.89](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#089)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xii-p4.2"></span>); burning with longings for the heavenly
Jerusalem; looked up to the realms above, and said, “O Lord, Thy word
endureth for ever in heaven;” that is, among Thy Angels who serve
everlastingly in Thine armies, without desertion.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xii-p5"></span>90. But the next verse, after heaven,
pertaineth consequently to earth. For this is one verse of the eight
which relate to this letter. For eight verses are appended to each of
these Hebrew letters, <span id="fr_5256"></span>[5257](#fn_5256) until
this long Psalm be ended. “Thy truth also remaineth from one generation
to the other: Thou hast laid the foundation of the earth, and it
abideth” ([Psa. 119.90](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#090)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xii-p6.1"></span>). Beholding therefore the earth next after
heaven with the gaze of a faithful mind, he findeth in it generations
which are not in heaven, and saith, “Thy truth remaineth from one
generation to the other:” signifying all generations by this expression,
from which the Truth of God was never absent in His saints, at one time
fewer, at one time more in number, according as the times happened or
shall happen to vary; or wishing two particular generations to be
understood, one pertaining to the Law and the Prophets, another to the
Gospel.…

<span id="ii.CXIX.xii-p7"></span>91. “Day continueth according to Thy
ordinance” ([Psa. 119.91](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#091)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xii-p7.1"></span>). For all these things are day: “and this
is the day which the Lord hath made: let us rejoice and be glad in
it:” <span id="fr_5257"></span>[5258](#fn_5257) and “let us walk
honestly as in the day.” <span id="fr_5258"></span>[5259](#fn_5258) “For
all things serve Thee.” He said all things of some: “all” which belong
to this day “serve Thee.” For the ungodly of whom it is said, “I have
compared thy mother unto the night,” <span
id="fr_5259"></span>[5260](#fn_5259) do not serve Thee.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xii-p11"></span>92. He then looketh back towards the
source of this earth’s deliverance, which caused it to abide when
founded; and addeth, “If my delight had not been in Thy law, I should
perchance have perished in my humiliation” ([Psa.
119.92](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#092)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xii-p11.1"></span>). This is the law of faith, not a vain
faith, but that which worketh through love. <span
id="fr_5260"></span>[5261](#fn_5260) Through this grace is gained, which
maketh men courageous in temporal tribulation, that they may not perish
in the humiliation of mortality.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xii-p13"></span>93. “I will never forget,” he saith,
“Thy righteousnesses, for with them Thou hast quickened me” ([Psa.
119.93](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#093)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xii-p13.1"></span>). Behold how it was that he did not
perish in his humiliation. For, save God quickeneth, what is man, Who
can indeed kill, but cannot quicken himself?

<span id="ii.CXIX.xii-p14"></span>94. He next addeth: “I am Thine: O
save me, for I have sought Thy righteousnesses” ([Psa.
119.94](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#094)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xii-p14.1"></span>). We must not understand lightly the
words, “I am Thine.” For what is not His? <span
id="fr_5261"></span>[5262](#fn_5261) Why then is it that the Psalmist
hath commended himself unto God somewhat in a more familiar sense, in
these words, “I am Thine: O save me;” save because he wished it to be
understood that he had desired to be his own only to his harm, which is
the first and the greatest evil of disobedience? and as if he should
say, I wished to be my own, and I lost myself: “I am Thine,” he saith,
“O save me, for I have sought Thy righteousnesses;” not my own
inclinations, whereby I was my own, but “Thy righteousnesses,” that I
might now be Thine.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xii-p16"></span>95. “The ungodly,” he saith, “have
awaited me that they might destroy me; but I have understood Thy
testimonies” ([Psa. 119.95](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#095)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xii-p16.1"></span>). What meaneth, “that they might destroy
me”? Did he then fear that he should perish altogether at the death of
his body? God forbid! and what meaneth, “have awaited me,” save that he
should consent with them unto iniquity? For then they would destroy him.
And he hath said why he hath not perished: “I understood Thy
testimonies.” The Greek word, <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.CXIX.xii-p16.2"></span> Μαρτύρια</span>, soundeth more familiarly
to the ears of the Church. For though they should slay me not consenting
unto them, yet while I confessed Thy testimonies (*martyria*) I should
not perish; but they who, that they might destroy me, were waiting till
I should consent unto them, tortured me even when I did confess them.
Yet he did not leave that which he had understood, looking on it and
seeing an end without end, if only he should persevere unto the end.

<span id="ii.CXIX.xii-p17"></span>96. Lastly, he next saith, “I have
seen an end of all consummation: but Thy commandment is exceeding broad”
([Psa. 119.96](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#096)<span
id="ii.CXIX.xii-p17.1"></span>). For he had entered into the sanctuary
of God, and had understood the end. <span
id="fr_5262"></span>[5263](#fn_5262) Now “all consummation” appeareth to
me in this place to signify, the striving even unto death for the
truth, <span id="fr_5263"></span>[5264](#fn_5263) and the endurance of
every evil for the true and chief good: the end of which consummation is
to excel in the kingdom of Christ, which hath no end; and there to have
without death, without pain, and <span id="page_576">p. 576</span> <span
id="ii.CXIX.xii-Page_576"></span>with great honour, life, acquired by
the death of this life, and by sorrows and reproaches. But in what he
hath added, “Thy commandment is exceeding broad;” I understand only
love. For what would it have profited him, whatever death impended over
him, in the midst of whatsoever torment, to confess those testimonies,
if love were not in the confessor?…Broad therefore is the commandment of
charity, that twofold commandment, whereby we are enjoined to love God
and our neighbour. But what is broader than that, “on” which “hang all
the Law and the Prophets”? <span id="fr_5264"></span>[5265](#fn_5264)
