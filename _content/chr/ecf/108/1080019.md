<span id="ii.XV-p1"></span> <span id="ii.XV-p1.1"></span><span
class="c20"><span id="ii.XV-p1.2"></span>Psalm XV. <span
id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495) </span>

<span id="ii.XV-p3"></span>A psalm of David himself.

<span id="ii.XV-p4"></span>1. Touching this title there is no question.
“O Lord who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle?” ([Psa.
15.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001)<span id="ii.XV-p4.1"></span>).
Although tabernacle be sometimes used even for an everlasting
habitation: yet when tabernacle is taken in its proper meaning, it is a
thing of war. Hence soldiers are called tent-fellows, <span
id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496) as having their tents together. This
sense is assisted by the words, “Who shall sojourn?” For we war with the
devil for a time, and then we need a tabernacle wherein we may refresh
ourselves. Which specially points out the faith of the temporal
Dispensation, which was wrought for us in time through the Incarnation
of the Lord. “And who shall rest in Thy holy mountain?” Here perhaps he
signifies at once the eternal habitation itself,  <span
id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497) that we should understand by
“mountain” the supereminence of the love of Christ in life
eternal. <span id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498)

<span id="ii.XV-p8"></span>2. “He who walketh without stain, and worketh
righteousness” ([Psa. 15.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#002)<span
id="ii.XV-p8.1"></span>). Here he has laid down the proposition; in what
follows he sets it forth in detail.

<span id="ii.XV-p9"></span>3. “Who speaketh the truth in his heart.” For
some have truth on their lips, and not in their heart. As if one should
deceitfully point out a road, knowing that there were robbers there, and
should say, If you go this way, you will be safe from robbers; and it
should turn out that in fact there were no robbers found there: he has
spoken the truth, but not in his heart. For he supposed it to be
otherwise, and spoke the truth in ignorance. Therefore it is not enough
to speak the truth, unless it be so also in heart. “Who hath practised
no deceit in his tongue” ([Psa.
15.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#003)<span id="ii.XV-p9.1"></span>).
Deceit is practised with the tongue, when one thing is professed with
the mouth, another concealed in the breast. “Nor done evil to his
neighbour.” It is well known that by “neighbour,” every man should be
un<span id="page_48">p. 48</span> <span
id="ii.XV-Page_48"></span>derstood. “And hath not entertained slander
against his neighbour,” that is, hath not readily or rashly given
credence to an accuser.

<span id="ii.XV-p10"></span>4. “The malicious one hath been brought to
nought in his sight” <span id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499) ([Psa.
15.4](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004)<span id="ii.XV-p11.1"></span>).
This is perfection, that the malicious one have no force against a man;
and that this be “in his sight;” that is, that he know most surely that
the malicious is not, save when the mind turns itself away from the
eternal and immutable form <span id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500) of
her own Creator to the form of the creature, which was made out of
nothing. “But those that fear the Lord, He glorifieth:” the Lord
Himself, that is. Now “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
wisdom.” <span id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501) As then the things
above belong to the perfect, so what he is now going to say belongs to
beginners.

<span id="ii.XV-p14"></span>5. “Who sweareth unto his neighbour, and
deceiveth him not.” “Who hath not given his money upon usury, and hath
not taken rewards against the innocent” ([Psa.
15.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#005)<span id="ii.XV-p14.1"></span>).
These are no great things: but he who is not able to do even this, much
less able is he to speak the truth in his heart, and to practise no
deceit in his tongue, but as the truth is in the heart, so to profess
and have it in his mouth, “yea, yea; nay, nay;”  <span
id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502) and to do no evil to his neighbour,
that is, to any man; and to entertain no slander against his neighbour:
all which are the virtues of the perfect, in whose sight the malicious
one hath been brought to nought. Yet he concludes even these lesser
things thus, “Whoso doeth these things shall not be moved for ever:”
that is, he shall attain unto those greater things, wherein is great and
unshaken stability. For even the very tenses are, perhaps not without
cause, so varied, as that in the conclusion above the past tense should
be used, but in this the future. For there it was said, “The malicious
one hath been brought to nought in his sight:” but here, “shall not be
moved for ever.”
