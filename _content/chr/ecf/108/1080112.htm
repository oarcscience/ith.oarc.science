<p class="c26"><a name="ii.CI-p3"></A>1. In this Psalm, we ought to seek in the whole body of it what we find in the first verse: &#8220;Mercy and judgment will I sing unto Thee, O Lord&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001">Psa. 101.1</a><a name="ii.CI-p3.1"></A>). Let no man flatter himself that he will never be punished through God&#146;s mercy; for there is judgment also; and let no man who hath been changed for the better dread the Lord&#146;s judgment, seeing that mercy goeth before it. For when men judge, sometimes overcome by  mercy, they act against justice; and mercy, but not justice, seemeth to be in them: while sometimes, when they wish to enforce a rigid judgment, they lose mercy. But God neither loseth the severity of judgment in the bounty of mercy, nor in judging with severity loseth the bounty of mercy. Suppose we distinguish these two, mercy and judgment, by time; for possibly, they are not placed in this order without a meaning, so that he said not &#8220;judgment and mercy,&#8221; but &#8220;mercy and  judgment:&#8221; so that if we distinguish them by succession in time, perhaps we find that the present is the season for mercy, the future for judgment. How is it that the season of mercy cometh first? Consider first how it is with God, that thou also mayest imitate the Father, in so far as He shall permit thee.&#8230;&#8220;He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.&#8221; Behold mercy. When thou seest the just and the unjust behold the  same sun, enjoy the same light, drink from the same founts, satisfied with the same rain, blessed with the same fruits of the earth, inhale this air in the same way, possess equally the world&#146;s goods; think not that God is unjust, who giveth these things equally to the just and the unjust. It is the season of mercy, not as yet of judgment. For unless God spared at first through mercy, He would not find those whom He could crown through judgment. There is therefore a season for mercy,  when the long-suffering of God calleth sinners to repentance.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.CI-p4"></A>2. Hear the Apostle distinguishing each season, and do thou also distinguish it.&#8230;&#8220;Thinkest thou,&#8221; he saith, &#8220;O man, that judgest them that do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?&#8221; And as if we were to reply, Why do I commit such sins daily, and no evil occurreth unto me? he goeth on to show to him the season of mercy: &#8220;Despisest thou the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering?&#8221; And he  did indeed despise them; but the Apostle hath made him anxious. &#8220;Not knowing,&#8221; he saith, &#8220;that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4559"></A><A HREF="#fn_4559"><FONT SIZE="1">4560</FONT></A>
 Behold the season of mercy. But that he might not think this would last for ever, how did he in the next verse raise his fears? Now hear the season of judgment; thou hast heard the season of mercy, on which account, &#8220;mercy and judgment will I sing unto Thee, O Lord:&#8221; &#8220;But thou,&#8221; saith the Apostle, &#8220;after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will  render to every man <A NAME="page_492"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 492</FONT></A> <a name="ii.CI-Page_492"></A>according to his deeds.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4560"></A><A HREF="#fn_4560"><FONT SIZE="1">4561</FONT></A>
 Lo, &#8220;mercy and judgment.&#8221; But he hath threatened concerning judgment: is therefore the judgment of God to be feared only, and not to be loved? To be feared by the wicked on account of punishment, to be loved by the good on account of the crown. Because then the Apostle hath alarmed the wicked in the testimony which I have quoted, hear where he giveth hope concerning judgment to the good. He puts forth himself, and shows in himself too the season of mercy. For  unless he found a period of mercy, in what condition would judgment find him? A blasphemer, a persecutor, an injurer of others. For he thus speaketh, and praiseth the season of mercy, in which season we are now living: &#8220;I who was before,&#8221; he saith, &#8220;a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy.&#8221; But perhaps he only hath obtained mercy? Hear how he cheereth us: &#8220;That in me,&#8221; he saith, &#8220;first, Christ Jesus might show forth all long-suffering, for  a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on Him to life everlasting.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4561"></A><A HREF="#fn_4561"><FONT SIZE="1">4562</FONT></A>
 What meaneth, &#8220;that He might show forth all long-suffering&#8221;? That every sinner and wicked man might see that Paul received pardon, and might not despair of himself? Lo, he hath instanced himself, and thereby cheered others also.&#8230;But did Paul alone deserve this? For I had asserted, that as he raised our fears by the former testimony, so did he encourage us by the latter. When he said, &#8220;The Lord, the righteous Judge, shall render to me at that day:&#8221; he  addeth, &#8220;and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4562"></A><A HREF="#fn_4562"><FONT SIZE="1">4563</FONT></A>
 and His kingdom. Since therefore, brethren, we have a season of mercy, let us not on that account flatter, or indulge ourselves, saying, God spareth ever.&#8230;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.CI-p9"></A>3. &#8220;I will sing to the harp, and will have understanding, in the spotless way. When Thou shalt come unto me&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#002">Psa. 101.2</a><a name="ii.CI-p9.1"></A>). Except in the spotless way, thou canst neither sing to the harp, nor understand. If thou dost wish to understand, sing in the spotless way, that is, work with cheerfulness before thy God. What is the spotless way? Hear what followeth: &#8220;I walked in innocence, in the midst of my house.&#8221; This spotless way beginneth from innocence, and it endeth also in innocence. Why seek many words? Be innocent: and thou hast perfected righteousness.&#8230;But  who is innocent? He who while he hurteth not another, injureth not himself. For he who hurteth himself, is not innocent. Some one saith: Lo, I have not robbed any one, I have not oppressed any one: I will live happily on my own substance, the fruits of my virtuous toil; I wish to have fine banquets, I wish to spend as much as pleaseth me, to drink with those whom I like as much as I please; whom have I robbed, whom have I oppressed, who hath complained of me? He seemeth innocent.  But if he corrupt himself, if he overthrow the temple of God within himself, why hope that he will act with mercy toward others, and spare the wretched? Can that man be merciful to others, who unto himself is cruel? The whole of righteousness, therefore, is reduced to the one word, innocence. But the lover of iniquity, hateth his own soul. When he loved iniquity, he fancied he was injuring others. But consider whether he was injuring others: &#8220;He who loveth iniquity,&#8221; he saith,  &#8220;hateth his own soul.&#8221; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4563"></A><A HREF="#fn_4563"><FONT SIZE="1">4564</FONT></A>
 He therefore who wishes to injure another, first injureth himself; nor doth he walk, since there is no room. For all wickedness suffereth from narrowness: innocence alone is broad enough to walk in. &#8220;I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house.&#8221; By the middle of his house, he either signifieth the Church herself; for Christ walketh in her: or his own heart; for our inner house is our heart: as he hath explained in the above words, &#8220;in  the innocence of my heart.&#8221; What is the innocence of the heart? The middle of his house? Whoever hath a bad house in this, is driven out of doors. For whoever is oppressed within his heart by a bad conscience, just as any man in consequence of the overflow of a waterspout or of smoke goeth out of his house, suffereth not himself to dwell therein; so he who hath not a quiet heart, cannot happily dwell in his heart. Such men go out of themselves in the bent of their mind, and delight  themselves with things without, that affect the body; they seek repose in trifles, in spectacles, in luxuries, in all evils. Wherefore do they wish themselves well without? Because it is not well with them within, so that they may rejoice in a good conscience.&#8230;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.CI-p11"></A>4. &#8220;I set no wicked thing before my eyes&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#003">Psa. 101.3</a><a name="ii.CI-p11.1"></A>).&#8230;I did love no wicked thing. And he explaineth this same wicked thing: &#8220;I hated them that do unfaithfulness.&#8221; Attend, my brethren. If ye walk with Christ in the midst of His house, that is, if either in your heart ye have a good repose, or in the Church herself proceed on a good journey in the way of godliness; ye ought not to hate those unfaithful only who are  without, but whomsoever also ye may have found within. Who are the unfaithful? They who hate the law of God; who hear, and do it not, are called unfaithful. Hate the doers of unfaithfulness, repel them from thee. But thou shouldest hate the unfaithful, not men: one man who is unfaithful, hath, ye see, two names, man, and unfaithful: God made him <A NAME="page_493"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 493</FONT></A> <a name="ii.CI-Page_493"></A>man, he made himself unfaithful; love in him what God made, persecute in him what he made himself. For when thou shalt have  persecuted his unfaithfulness, thou killest the work of man, and freest the work of God. &#8220;I hated the doers of unfaithfulness.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.CI-p12"></A>5. &#8220;The wicked heart hath not cleaved unto me.&#8221;&#8230;The heart of a man, who wisheth not anything contrary to any that God wisheth, is called straight.&#8230;If therefore the righteous heart followeth God, the crooked heart resisteth God. Suppose something untoward happeneth to him, he crieth out, &#8220;God, what have I done unto Thee? What sin have I committed?&#8221; He wisheth himself to appear just, God unjust. What is so crooked as this? It is not enough that thou  art crooked thyself: thou must think thy rule crooked also. Reform thyself, and thou findest Him straight, in departing from whom thou hast made thyself crooked. He doth justly, thou unjustly; and for this reason thou art perverse, since thou callest man just, and God unjust. What man dost thou call just? Thyself. For when thou sayest, &#8220;What have I done unto Thee?&#8221; thou thinkest thyself just. But let God answer thee: &#8220;Thou speakest truth: thou hast done nothing to Me:  thou hast done all things unto thyself; for if thou hadst done anything for Me, thou wouldest have done good. For whatever is done well, is done unto Me; because it is done according to My commandment; but whatever of evil is done, is done unto thee, not unto Me; for the wicked man doth nothing except for his own sake, since it is not what I command.&#8221; When ye see such men, brethren, reprove them, convince and correct them: and if ye cannot reprove or correct them, consent not to  them.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.CI-p13"></A>6. &#8220;When the wicked man departed from me, I knew him not&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#004">Psa. 101.4</a><a name="ii.CI-p13.1"></A>). I approved him not, I praised him not, he pleased me not. For we find the word &#8220;to know&#8221; occasionally used in Scripture, in the sense of &#8220;to be pleased.&#8221; For what is hidden from God, brethren? Doth He know the just, and doth He not know the unjust? What dost thou think of, that He doth not know? I say not, what thinkest thou; but what wilt thou ever think, that He will not have seen beforehand? God knoweth all things, then; and yet in the  end, that is in judgment after mercy, He saith of some persons: &#8220;I will profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from Me, ye workers of iniquity.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4564"></A><A HREF="#fn_4564"><FONT SIZE="1">4565</FONT></A>
 Was there any one He did not know? But what meaneth, &#8220;I never knew you&#8221;? I acknowledge you not in My rule. For I know the rule of My righteousness: ye agree not with it, ye have turned aside from it, ye are crooked. Therefore He said here also: &#8220;When the wicked man departed from Me, I knew him not.&#8221;&#8230;Therefore, &#8220;when the wicked man departed from me,&#8221; that is, when the wicked man was unlike me, and was unwilling to imitate my paths, was unwilling in  his wickedness to live as I had proposed myself for his imitation; &#8220;I knew him not.&#8221; What meaneth, &#8220;I knew him not&#8221;? Not that I was ignorant of him, but that I did not approve him.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.CI-p15"></A>7. &#8220;Whoso privily slandered his neighbour, him I persecuted&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#005">Psa. 101.5</a><a name="ii.CI-p15.1"></A>). Behold the righteous persecutor, not of the man, but of the sin. &#8220;With the proud eye, and the insatiable heart, I did not feed.&#8221; What meaneth, &#8220;I did not feed with&#8221;? I did not eat in common with such. Attend, beloved; since ye are about to hear something wonderful. If he did not feed with this man, he did not eat with him; for to feed is to eat; how is it then that we find our Lord Himself eating with the proud? It was not only with those  publicans and sinners, for they were humble: for they acknowledged their weakness, and asked for the physician. We find that He ate with the proud Pharisees themselves. A certain proud man had invited Him: it was the same who was displeased because a sinning woman, one of ill repute in the city, approached the feet of our Lord.&#8230;That Pharisee was proud: the Lord ate with him; what is it therefore that he saith? &#8220;With such an one I did not eat.&#8221; How doth He enjoin unto us what  He hath not done Himself? He exhorteth us to imitate Himself: we see that He ate with the proud; how doth He forbid us to eat with the proud? We indeed, brethren, for the sake of reproof, abstain from communion with our brethren, and do not eat with them, that they may be reformed? We rather eat with strangers, with Pagans, than with those who hold with us, if we have seen that they live wickedly, that they may be ashamed, and amend; as the Apostle saith, &#8220;And if any man obey not our  word by this Epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4565"></A><A HREF="#fn_4565"><FONT SIZE="1">4566</FONT></A>
 For the sake of healing others we usually do this; but nevertheless we often eat with many strangers and ungodly men.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.CI-p17"></A>8. The pious heart hath its banquets, the proud heart hath its banquets: for it was on account of the food of the proud heart, that he said, &#8220;with an insatiable heart.&#8221; How is the proud heart fed? If a man is proud, he is envious: otherwise it cannot be. Pride is the mother of enviousness: it cannot but generate it, and ever coexist with it. Every proud man is, therefore, envious: if envious, he feedeth on <A NAME="page_494"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 494</FONT></A> <a name="ii.CI-Page_494"></A>the misfortunes of  others. Whence the Apostle saith, &#8220;But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed of one another.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4566"></A><A HREF="#fn_4566"><FONT SIZE="1">4567</FONT></A>
 Ye see them, then, eating: eat not with these: fly such banquets: for they cannot satisfy themselves with rejoicing in others&#146; evils, because their hearts are insatiable. Beware thou art not caught in their feasts by the devil&#146;s noose.&#8230;Just as birds feed at the trap, or fishes at the hook, they were taken, when they fed. The ungodly therefore have their own feasts, the godly also have theirs. Hear the feasts of the godly: &#8220;Blessed are they who hunger  and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4567"></A><A HREF="#fn_4567"><FONT SIZE="1">4568</FONT></A>
 If therefore the godly eateth the meat of righteousness, and the ungodly of pride; it is no wonder if he is insatiable in heart. He eateth the meat of iniquity: do not eat the meat of iniquity, and the proud in eye, and the insatiable in heart, eateth not with thee.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.CI-p20"></A>9. And whence wast thou fed? And what pleased thee, when he did not eat with thee? &#8220;Mine eyes,&#8221; he saith, &#8220;were upon such as are faithful in the land, that they might sit with me&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#006">Psa. 101.6</a><a name="ii.CI-p20.1"></A>). That is, that with Me they might be seated.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4568"></A><A HREF="#fn_4568"><FONT SIZE="1">4569</FONT></A>
 In what sense are they &#8220;to sit&#8221;? &#8220;Ye shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4569"></A><A HREF="#fn_4569"><FONT SIZE="1">4570</FONT></A>
 The faithful of the earth judge, for to them it is said, &#8220;Know ye not, that we shall judge angels?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4570"></A><A HREF="#fn_4570"><FONT SIZE="1">4571</FONT></A>
 &#8220;Whoso walketh in a spotless way, he ministered unto me.&#8221; To &#8220;Me,&#8221; he saith, not to himself. For many minister the Gospel, but unto themselves; because they seek their own things, not the things of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4571"></A><A HREF="#fn_4571"><FONT SIZE="1">4572</FONT></A>
&#8230;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.CI-p25"></A>10. &#8220;The proud man hath not dwelt in the midst of my house&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#007">Psa. 101.7</a><a name="ii.CI-p25.1"></A>). Understand this of the heart. The proud did not dwell in my heart: no such dwelt in my heart: for he hurried away from me. None but the meek and peaceful dwelt in my heart; the proud dwelt not there, for the unrighteous one dwelleth not in the heart of the righteous. Let the righteous be distant from thee, I know not how many miles and stations:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4572"></A><A HREF="#fn_4572"><FONT SIZE="1">4573</FONT></A>
 ye dwell together, if ye have one heart. &#8220;The proud doer hath not dwelt in the midst of my house: he that speaketh unjust things hath not directed in the sight of my eyes.&#8221; This is the spotless way, where we understand when the Lord cometh unto us.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.CI-p27"></A>11. &#8220;In the morning I destroyed all the ungodly that were in the land. That I may root out all wicked doers from the city of the Lord&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#008">Psa. 101.8</a><a name="ii.CI-p27.1"></A>). This is obscure. There are then wicked doers in the city of the Lord, and they at present, seemingly, spared. Why so? Because it is the season of mercy: but that of judgment will come; for the Psalm thus began, &#8220;Of mercy and judgment will I sing unto Thee, O  Lord.&#8221;&#8230;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.CI-p28"></A>12. He at present spareth, He will then judge. But when will He judge? When night shall have passed away. For this reason He hath said: &#8220;In the morning.&#8221; When the day shall at last have arrived, night having passed by. Why doth He spare them until the dawn? Because it was night. What meaneth, it was night? Because it was the season for mercy: He was merciful, while the hearts of men were hidden. Thou seest some one living ill; thou  endurest him: for thou knowest not of what sort he will prove to be; since it is night; whether he who to-day liveth ill, to-morrow may live well; and whether he who to-day liveth well, to-morrow may be wicked. For it is night, and God endureth all men, since He is of long-suffering: He endureth them, that sinners may be converted unto Him. But they who shall not have reformed themselves in that season of mercy, shall be slain. And wherefore? That they may be scattered abroad  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4573"></A><A HREF="#fn_4573"><FONT SIZE="1">4574</FONT></A>
 from the city of the Lord, from the fellowship of Jerusalem, from the fellowship of the Saints, from the fellowship of the Church. But when shall they be slain? &#8220;At dawn.&#8221; What meaneth, &#8220;at dawn&#8221;? When night shall have passed away. Wherefore now doth he spare? Because it is the season of mercy. Why doth He not always spare? Because, &#8220;Mercy and judgment will I sing unto Thee, O Lord.&#8221; Brethren, let no man flatter himself: all the doers of  iniquity shall be slain; Christ shall slay them at the dawn, and shall destroy them from His city. But now while it is the time of mercy, let them hear Him. Everywhere He crieth out by the Law, by the Prophets, by the Psalms, by the Epistles, by the Gospels: see that He is not silent; that He spareth; that He granteth mercy; but beware, for the judgment will come.</p>
