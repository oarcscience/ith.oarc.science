</span></p>  
<p class="c26"><a name="ii.LIV-p3"></A>1. The title of this Psalm hath fruit in the prolixity thereof, if it be understood: and because the Psalm is short, let us make up our not having to tarry over the Psalm by tarrying over the title. For upon this dependeth every verse which is sung. If any one, therefore, observe that which on the front of the house is fixed, secure he will enter; and, when he shall have entered, he will not err. For this on the post itself is prominently marked, namely,  in what manner within he may not be in error. The title thereof standeth thus: &#8220;At the end, in hymns, understanding to David himself, when there came the Ziphites, and said to Saul, Behold, is not David hidden with us?&#8221; That Saul was persecutor of the holy man David, very well we know: that Saul was bearing the figure of a temporal kingdom, not to life but to death belonging, this also to your Love we remember to have imparted. And also that David himself was bearing the figure of  Christ, or of the Body of Christ, ye ought both to know and to call to mind, ye that have already learned.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1947"></A><A HREF="#fn_1947"><FONT SIZE="1">1948</FONT></A>
 What then of the Ziphites? There was a certain village, Ziph, whereof the inhabitants were Ziphites, in whose country David had hidden himself, when Saul would find and slay him. These Ziphites then, when they had learned this, betrayed him to the king his persecutor, saying, &#8220;Behold, is not David hidden with us?&#8221; Of no good to them indeed was their betrayal, and to David himself of no harm. For their evil disposition was shown: but Saul not even after their  betrayal could seize David; but rather in a certain cave in that very country, when into his hands Saul had been given to slay, David spared him, and that which he had in his power he did not.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1948"></A><A HREF="#fn_1948"><FONT SIZE="1">1949</FONT></A>
 But the other was seeking to do that which he had not in his power. Let them that have been Ziphites take heed: let us see those whom to us the Psalm presenteth to be understood by the occasion of those same men.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.LIV-p6"></A>2. If we inquire then by what word is translated Ziphites, we find, &#8220;Men flourishing.&#8221; Flourishing then were certain enemies to holy David, flourishing before him hiding. We may find them in mankind, if we are willing to under<A NAME="page_206"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 206</FONT></A> <a name="ii.LIV-Page_206"></A>stand the Psalm. Let us find here at first David hiding, and we shall find his adversaries flourishing. Observe David hiding: &#8220;For ye are dead,&#8221; saith the Apostle to the members of Christ, &#8220;and your life is  hid with Christ in God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1949"></A><A HREF="#fn_1949"><FONT SIZE="1">1950</FONT></A>
 These men, therefore, that are hiding, when shall they be flourishing? &#8220;When Christ,&#8221; he saith, &#8220;your life, shall have appeared, then ye also with Him shall appear in glory.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1950"></A><A HREF="#fn_1950"><FONT SIZE="1">1951</FONT></A>
 When these men shall be flourishing, then shall be those Ziphites withering. For observe to what flower their glory is compared: &#8220;All flesh is grass, and the honour of flesh as the flower of grass.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1951"></A><A HREF="#fn_1951"><FONT SIZE="1">1952</FONT></A>
 What is the end? &#8220;The grass hath withered, and the flower hath fallen off.&#8221; Where then shall be David? See what followeth: &#8220;But the Word of the Lord abideth for ever.&#8221;&#8230;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.LIV-p10"></A>3. These men sometimes are observed of the weak sons of light, and their feet totter, when they have seen evil men in felicity to flourish, and they say to themselves, &#8220;Of what profit to me is innocence? What doth it advantage me that I serve God, that I keep His commandments, that I oppress no one, from no one plunder anything, hurt no one, that what I can I bestow? behold, all these things I do, and they flourish, I toil.&#8221; But why? Wouldest thou also  wish to be a Ziphite? They flourish in the world, wither in judgment, and after withering, into fire everlasting shall be cast: wouldest thou also choose this? Art thou ignorant of what He hath promised thee, who to thee hath come, what in Himself here He displayed? If the flower of the Ziphites were to be desired, would not Himself thy Lord also in this world have flourished? Or indeed was there wanting to Him the power to flourish? Nay but here He chose rather amid the Ziphites to  hide, and to say to Pontius Pilate, as if to one being himself also a flower of the Ziphites, and in suspicion about His kingdom, &#8220;My kingdom is not of this world.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1952"></A><A HREF="#fn_1952"><FONT SIZE="1">1953</FONT></A>
 Therefore here He was hidden: and all good men are hidden here, because their good is within, it is concealed, in the heart it is, where is faith, where charity, where hope, where their treasure is. Do these good things appear in the world? Both these good things are hidden, and the reward of these good things is hidden.&#8230;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.LIV-p12"></A>4. &#8220;O God, in Thy name make me safe, and in Thy virtue judge me&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001">Psa. 54.1</a><a name="ii.LIV-p12.1"></A>). Let the Church say this, hiding amid the Ziphites. Let the Christian body say this, keeping secret the good of its morals, expecting in secret the reward of its merits, let it say this: &#8220;In Thy virtue&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1953"></A><A HREF="#fn_1953"><FONT SIZE="1">1954</FONT></A>
 judge me.&#8221; Thou hast come, O Christ, humble Thou hast appeared, despised Thou hast been, scourged hast been, crucified hast been, slain hast been; but, on the third day hast risen, on the fortieth day into Heaven hast ascended: Thou sittest at the right hand of the Father, and no one seeth: Thy Spirit thence Thou hast sent, which men that were worthy have received; fulfilled with Thy love, the praise of that very humility of Thine throughout the world and nations they  have preached: Thy name I see to excel among mankind, but nevertheless as weak to us hast Thou been preached. For not even did that Teacher of the Gentiles say, that among us he knew anything, &#8220;Save Christ Jesus, and Him crucified;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1954"></A><A HREF="#fn_1954"><FONT SIZE="1">1955</FONT></A>
 in order that of Him we might choose the reproach, rather than the glory of the flourishing Ziphites. Nevertheless, of Him he saith what? &#8220;Although He died of weakness, yet He liveth of the power&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1955"></A><A HREF="#fn_1955"><FONT SIZE="1">1956</FONT></A>
 of God.&#8221; He came then that He might die of weakness, He is to come that He may judge in the power of God: but through the weakness of the Cross His name hath been illustrious. Whosoever shall not have believed upon the name made illustrious through weakness, shall stand in awe at the Judge, when He shall have come in power. But, lest He that once was weak, when He shall have come strong, with that fan send us to the left hand; may He &#8220;save us in His name, and judge  us in His virtue.&#8221; For who so rash as to have desired this, as to say to God, for instance &#8220;Judge me&#8221;? Is it not wont to be said to men for a curse, &#8220;God judge thee&#8221;? So evidently it is a curse, if He judge thee in His virtue; and shall not have saved thee in His name: but when in name precedent He shall have saved thee, to thy health in virtue consequent He shall judge. Be thou without care: that judgment shall not to thee be punishment, but dividing. For in a certain  Psalm &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1956"></A><A HREF="#fn_1956"><FONT SIZE="1">1957</FONT></A>
 thus is said: &#8220;Judge me, O God, and divide my cause from the nation unholy.&#8221;&#8230;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.LIV-p17"></A>5. &#8220;O God, hearken to my prayer, in Thy ears receive the words of my mouth&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#002">Psa. 54.2</a><a name="ii.LIV-p17.1"></A>).&#8230;To Thee may my prayer attain, driven forth and darted out from the desire of Thy eternal blessings: to Thy ears I send it forth, aid it that it may reach, lest it fall short in the middle of the way, and fainting as it were it fall down. But even if there result not to me now the good things which I ask, I am secured nevertheless  that hereafter they will come. For even in the case of transgressions a certain man is said to have asked of God, and not to have been hearkened to for his good. For privations of this world had inspired him to prayer, and being set in temporal tribulations he had wished that temporal tribulations should pass away, and there should return the flower of grass; and he saith, &#8220;My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1957"></A><A HREF="#fn_1957"><FONT SIZE="1">1958</FONT></A>
 The very voice of Christ it is, but for <A NAME="page_207"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 207</FONT></A> <a name="ii.LIV-Page_207"></A>His members&#146; sake. &#8220;The words,&#8221; he saith, &#8220;of my transgressions I have cried to Thee throughout the day, and Thou hast not hearkened: and by night, and not for the sake of folly to me:&#8221; that is, &#8220;and by night I have cried, and Thou hast not hearkened; and nevertheless in this very thing that Thou hast not hearkened, it is not for the sake of folly to me that Thou hast not hearkened, but  rather for the sake of wisdom that Thou hast not hearkened, that I might perceive what of Thee I ought to ask. For those things I was asking which to my cost perchance I should have received.&#8221; Thou askest riches, O man; how many have been overset through their riches? Whence knowest thou whether to thee riches may profit? Have not many poor men more safely been in obscurity; having become rich men, so soon as they have begun to blaze forth, they have been a prey to the stronger? How  much better they would have lain concealed, how much better they would have been unknown, that have begun to be inquired after not for the sake of what they were, but for the sake of what they had! In these temporal things therefore, brethren, we admonish and exhort you in the Lord, that ye ask not anything as if it were a thing settled, but that which God knoweth to be expedient for you. For what is expedient for you, ye know not at all. Sometimes that which ye think to be for you is  against you, and that which ye think to be against you is for you. For sick ye are; do not dictate to the physician the medicines he may choose to set beside you. If the teacher of the Gentiles, Paul the Apostle, saith, &#8220;For what we should pray for as we ought, we know not,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1958"></A><A HREF="#fn_1958"><FONT SIZE="1">1959</FONT></A>
 how much more we? Who nevertheless, when he seemed to himself to pray wisely, namely, that from him should be taken away the thorn of the flesh, the angel of Satan, that did buffet him, in order that he might not in the greatness of the revelations be lifted up, heard from the Lord what? Was that done which he wished? Nay,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1959"></A><A HREF="#fn_1959"><FONT SIZE="1">1960</FONT></A>
 in order to that being done which was expedient, he heard from the Lord, I say, what? &#8220;Thrice,&#8221; he saith, &#8220;I besought the Lord that He would take it from me; and He said to me, My Grace sufficeth for thee: for virtue in weakness is made perfect.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1960"></A><A HREF="#fn_1960"><FONT SIZE="1">1961</FONT></A>
 Salve to the wound I have applied; when I applied it I know, when it should be taken away I know. Let not a sick man draw back from the hands of the physician, let him not give advice to the physician. So it is with all these things temporal. There are tribulations; if well thou worshippest God, thou wilt know that He knoweth what is expedient for each man: there are prosperities; take the more heed, lest these same corrupt thy soul, so that it withdraw from Him that  hath given these things.&#8230;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.LIV-p22"></A>6. &#8220;For aliens have risen up against me&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#003">Psa. 54.3</a><a name="ii.LIV-p22.1"></A>). What &#8220;aliens&#8221;? Was not David himself a Jew of the tribe of Judah? But the very place Ziph belonged to the tribe of Judah; it was of the Jews. How then &#8220;aliens&#8221;? Not in city, not in tribe, not in kindred, but in flower.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1961"></A><A HREF="#fn_1961"><FONT SIZE="1">1962</FONT></A>
&#8230;But see the Ziphites, see them for a time flourishing. With reason &#8220;alien&#8221; sons. Thou amid the Ziphites hiding saidst what? &#8220;Blessed the people whereof the Lord is its God.&#8221; Out of this affection this prayer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1962"></A><A HREF="#fn_1962"><FONT SIZE="1">1963</FONT></A>
 is being sent forth into the ears of the Lord, when it is said, &#8220;for aliens have risen up against me.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.LIV-p25"></A>7. &#8220;And mighty men have sought after my soul.&#8221; For in a new manner, my brethren, they would destroy the race of holy men, and the race of them that abstain from hoping in this world, all they that have hope in this world. Certainly commingled they are, certainly together they live. Very much to one another are opposed these two sorts: the one of those that place no hope but in things secular, and in temporal felicity, and the other of those that do  firmly place their hope in the Lord God. And though concordant are these Ziphites, do not much trust to their concord: temptations are wanting; when there shall have come any temptation, so as that a person may be reproved for the flower of the world, I say not to thee he will quarrel with the Bishop, but not even to the Church Herself will he draw near, lest there fall any part of the grass.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1963"></A><A HREF="#fn_1963"><FONT SIZE="1">1964</FONT></A>
 Wherefore have I said these words, brethren? Because now gladly ye all hear in the name of Christ, and according as ye understand, so ye shout out at the word; ye would not indeed shout at it unless ye understood.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1964"></A><A HREF="#fn_1964"><FONT SIZE="1">1965</FONT></A>
 This your understanding ought to be fruitful. But whether it is fruitful, temptation doth try; lest suddenly when ye are said to be ours, through temptation ye be found aliens, and it be said, &#8220;Aliens have risen up against me, and mighty men have sought my soul.&#8221; Be not that said which followeth, &#8220;They have not set forth God before their face.&#8221; For when will he set God before his face, before whose eyes there is nought but the world? namely, how he may have  coin upon coin, how flocks may be increased, how barns may be filled, how it may be said to his soul, &#8220;Thou hast many good things, be merry, feast, take thy fill.&#8221; Doth he set before his face Him, that unto one so boasting and so blooming with the flower of the Ziphites saith, &#8220;Fool&#8221; (that is, &#8220;man not understanding,&#8221; <A NAME="page_208"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 208</FONT></A> <a name="ii.LIV-Page_208"></A>&#8220;man unwise&#8221;), &#8220;this night shall be taken from thee thy soul; all these things which thou hast prepared, whose shall they be?&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1965"></A><A HREF="#fn_1965"><FONT SIZE="1">1966</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="ii.LIV-p29"></A>8. &#8220;For behold, God helpeth me&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#004">Psa. 54.4</a><a name="ii.LIV-p29.1"></A>). Even themselves know not themselves, amid whom I am hiding. But if they too were to set God before their face, they would find in what manner God helpeth me. For all holy men are helped by God, but within, where no one seeth. For in like manner as the conscience of ungodly men is a great punishment, so a great joy is the very conscience of godly men. &#8220;For our glory  this is,&#8221; saith the Apostle, &#8220;the testimony of our conscience.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1966"></A><A HREF="#fn_1966"><FONT SIZE="1">1967</FONT></A>
 In this within, not in the flower of the Ziphites without, doth glory that man that now saith, &#8220;For behold God helpeth me.&#8221; Surely though afar off are to be those things which He promiseth, this day have I a sweet and present help; to-day in my heart&#146;s joy I find that without cause certain say, &#8220;Who doth show to us good things? For there is signed upon us the light of Thy countenance, O Lord, Thou hast put pleasantness into my heart.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1967"></A><A HREF="#fn_1967"><FONT SIZE="1">1968</FONT></A>
 Not into my vineyard, not into my flock, not into my cask, not into my table, but &#8220;into my heart.&#8221; &#8220;For behold God helpeth me.&#8221; How doth He help thee? &#8220;And the Lord is the lifter up of my soul.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.LIV-p32"></A>9. &#8220;Turn away evil things unto mine enemies&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#005">Psa. 54.5</a><a name="ii.LIV-p32.1"></A>). So however green they are, so however they flourish, for the fire they are being&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1968"></A><A HREF="#fn_1968"><FONT SIZE="1">1969</FONT></A>
 reserved. &#8220;In Thy virtue destroy Thou them.&#8221; Because to wit they flourish now, because to wit they spring up like grass:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1969"></A><A HREF="#fn_1969"><FONT SIZE="1">1970</FONT></A>
 do not thou be a man unwise and foolish, so that by giving thought to these things thou perish for ever and ever. For, &#8220;Turn Thou away evil things unto mine enemies.&#8221; For if thou shalt have place in the body of David Himself, in His virtue He will destroy them. These men flourish in the felicity of the world, perish in the virtue of God. Not in the same manner as they flourish, do they also perish: for they flourish for a time, perish for everlasting:  flourish in unreal good things, perish in real torments. &#8220;In Thy strength destroy,&#8221; whom in Thy weakness Thou hast endured.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.LIV-p35"></A>10. &#8220;Voluntarily I will sacrifice to Thee&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#006">Psa. 54.6</a><a name="ii.LIV-p35.1"></A>). Who can even understand this good thing of the heart, at another&#146;s speaking thereof, unless in himself he hath tasted it? What is, &#8220;Voluntarily I will sacrifice to Thee&#8221;?&#8230; For what sacrifice here shall I take, brethren? or what worthily shall I offer to the Lord for His mercy? Victims shall I seek from flock of sheep, ram shall I select, for any bull in  the herds shall I look out, frankincense indeed from the land of the Sab&aelig;ans shall I bring? What shall I do? What offer; except that whereof He speaketh, &#8220;Sacrifice of praise shall honour Me&#8221;?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1970"></A><A HREF="#fn_1970"><FONT SIZE="1">1971</FONT></A>
 Wherefore then &#8220;voluntarily&#8221;? Because truly I love that which I praise. I praise God, and in the self-same praise I rejoice: in the praise of Himself I rejoice, at whom being praised, I blush not. For He is not praised in the same manner as by those who love the theatrical follies is praised either by a charioteer, or a hunter, or actor of any kind, and by their praisers, other praisers are invited, are exhorted, to shout together: and when all have shouted,  ofttimes, if their favourite is overcome, they are all put to the blush. Not so is our God: be He praised with the will, loved with charity: let it be gratuitous (or voluntary) that He is loved and that He is praised. What is &#8220;gratuitous&#8221;? Himself for the sake of Himself, not for the sake of something else. For if thou praisest God in order that He may give thee something else, no longer freely dost thou love God. Thou wouldest blush, if thy wife for the sake of riches were to  love thee, and perchance if poverty should befall thee, should begin to think of adultery. Seeing that therefore thou wouldest be loved by thy partner freely, wilt thou for anything else love God? What reward art thou to receive of God, O covetous man? Not earth for thee, but Himself He keepeth, who made heaven and earth. &#8220;Voluntarily I will sacrifice to Thee:&#8221; do it not of necessity. For if for the sake of anything else thou praisest God, out of necessity thou praisest.&#8230;These  things also which He hath given, because of the Giver are good things. For He giveth entirely, He giveth these temporal things: and to certain men to their good, to certain men to their harm, after the height and depth of His judgments.&#8230;&#8220;Voluntarily I will sacrifice to Thee.&#8221; Wherefore &#8220;voluntarily&#8221;? Because <i>gratis</i>. What is <i>gratis?</i> &#8220;And I will confess to Thy name, O Lord, for it is a good thing:&#8221; for nothing else, but because a &#8220;good thing&#8221; it is.  Doth he say, &#8220;I will confess to Thy name, O Lord,&#8221; because Thou givest me fruitful manors, because Thou givest me gold and silver, because Thou givest me extended riches, abundant money, most exalted dignity? Nay. But what? &#8220;For it is a good thing.&#8221; Nothing I find better than Thy name.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.LIV-p37"></A>11. &#8220;For out of all tribulation Thou hast delivered me&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#007">Psa. 54.7</a><a name="ii.LIV-p37.1"></A>). For this cause I have perceived how good a thing is Thy name: for if this I were able before tribulations to acknowledge, perchance for me there had been no need of them. But tribulation hath been applied for admonition, admonition hath redounded to Thy praise. For I should not have understood <A NAME="page_209"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 209</FONT></A> <a name="ii.LIV-Page_209"></A>where I was, except of my weakness I had been admonished. &#8220;Out of all tribulations,&#8221; therefore, &#8220;Thou hast delivered me. And upon mine  enemies mine eye hath looked back:&#8221; upon those Ziphites &#8220;mine eye hath looked back.&#8221; Yea, their flower I have passed over in loftiness of heart, unto Thee I have come, and thence I have looked back upon them, and have seen that &#8220;All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass:&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1971"></A><A HREF="#fn_1971"><FONT SIZE="1">1972</FONT></A>
 as in a certain place is also said, &#8220;I have seen the ungodly man to be exalted and raised up like&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1972"></A><A HREF="#fn_1972"><FONT SIZE="1">1973</FONT></A>
 the cedars of Lebanon: I passed by, and, lo! he was not.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1973"></A><A HREF="#fn_1973"><FONT SIZE="1">1974</FONT></A>
 Wherefore &#8220;he was not&#8221;? Because thou hast passed by. What is, &#8220;because thou hast passed by&#8221;? Because not to no purpose hast thou heard &#8220;Lift up thy heart;&#8221; because not on earth, where thou wouldest have rotted, thou hast remained; because thou hast lifted thy soul to God, and thou hast mounted beyond the cedars of Lebanon, and from that elevation hast observed: and &#8220;Lo! he was not;&#8221; and thou hast sought him, and there hath not been found place for  him. No longer is labour before thee; because thou hast entered into the sanctuary of God, and hast understood for the last things.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1974"></A><A HREF="#fn_1974"><FONT SIZE="1">1975</FONT></A>
 So also here thus he concludeth. &#8220;And upon mine enemies mine eye hath looked back.&#8221; This do ye therefore, brethren, with your souls; lift up your hearts, sharpen the edge of your mind, learn truly to love God, learn to despise the present world, learn voluntarily to sacrifice the offerings of praise; to the end that, mounting beyond the flower of the grass, ye may look back upon your enemies.</p>
