<p>Although the early biographies of St. Francis are silent as to this opuscule, its authenticity is guaranteed by the Legend of St. Clare written by Thomas of Celano toward the end of his life.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_570"></A><A HREF="#fn_570"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> In reference to the holy abbess&#8217; devotion to the Passion we are told by Celano that she "learned and frequently recited with attachment the Office of the Cross which Francis, the lover of the Cross, had instituted."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_571"></A><A HREF="#fn_571"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> This passage was rightly understood by Wadding as referring to the Office of the Passion which many early MSS. attribute to St. Francis, and the character of which altogether squares with the Saint's writings. Composed, as it is, of a simple and devout combination of Scriptural texts, this document is at once a witness to St. Francis&#8217; ardent devotion to the Crucified and a precious example of his method of prayer. It comprises five parts:</p>

<p>2. For the Paschal season.</p>

<p>4. For Advent.</p>  
<p>5. For Christmas and the days following, to the close of the Epiphany octave.</div></p>

And they begin from Compline on Maundy Thursday because on that night our Lord Jesus Christ was betrayed and taken captive.

First he said the Psalms of the holy Virgin; besides he said other Psalms which he had selected, and at the end of all the Psalms which he said, he said the Psalms of the Passion, the Psalm being finished he said the antiphon, namely, <i>Holy Virgin Mary</i>.
