### II.

### SALUTATION OF THE VIRTUES.

Thomas of Celano, St. Francis’ earliest biographer, bears witness to the
authenticity of this exquisite Salutation in his *Second Life*, written
about 1247. <span id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_130) It is found in the
codices of Assisi, Berlin, Florence (Ognissanti MS.), Foligno, Liegnitz,
Naples, Paris (Mazarin MSS. and MS. of Prot. theol. fac.), and Rome
(Vatican MSS.), above mentioned, <span id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_131)
as well as at Düsseldorf (Royal arch. cod. B. 132), and is given by
Bartholomew of Pisa in his *Liber Conformitatum* <span
id="fr_132"></span>[3](#fn_132) (fruct. XII, P. 11, Cap. 38). This
Salutation was also published in the *Speculum Vitae B. Francisci et
Sociorum Ejus* (fol. 126 v) <span id="fr_133"></span>[4](#fn_133) and by
Wadding, <span id="fr_134"></span>[5](#fn_134) who followed the Assisian
codex. This codex, which is the oldest one containing the Salutation,
has been used for the Quaracchi edition, which I have here followed, as
well as the Ognissanti MS. and the version given in the *Conformities*.

Now follows the

#### SALUTATION OF THE VIRTUES. <span id="fr_135"></span>[6](#fn_135)

Hail, <span id="fr_136"></span>[7](#fn_136) queen wisdom! May the Lord
save thee with thy sister holy pure simplicity! O

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lady, holy
poverty, may the Lord save thee with thy sister holy humility! O Lady,
holy charity, may the Lord save thee with thy sister holy obedience! O
all ye most holy virtues, may the Lord, from whom you proceed and come,
save you! There is absolutely no man in the whole world who can possess
one among you unless he first die. He who possesses one and does not
offend the others, possesses all; and he who offends one, possesses none
and offends all; and every one \[of them\] confounds vices and sins.
Holy wisdom confounds Satan and all his wickednesses. Pure holy
simplicity confounds all the wisdom of this world and the wisdom of the
flesh. Holy poverty confounds cupidity and avarice and the cares of this
world. Holy humility confounds pride and all the men of this world and
all things that are in the world. Holy charity confounds all diabolical
and fleshly temptations and all fleshly fears. Holy obedience confounds
all bodily and fleshly desires and keeps the body mortified to the
obedience of the spirit and to the obedience of one's brother and makes
a man subject to all the men of this world and not to men alone, but
also to all beasts and wild animals, so that they may do with him
whatsoever they will, in so far as it may be granted to them from above
by the Lord.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_130"></span>[20:1](wosf04.htm#fr_130) "Wherefore," he
writes of St. Francis, "in the praises of the virtues which he composed
he says 'Hail! queen wisdom, God save Thee with Thy sister pure, holy
simplicity.'" See *2 Cel*. 3, 119, for this *Incipit*.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[20:2](wosf04.htm#fr_131) See page
[3](wosf03.htm#page_3).

<span id="fn_132"></span>[20:3](wosf04.htm#fr_132) In the text of the
*Conformities* (which for the most part agrees with that of the
Ognissanti MS.) the Salutation is preceded by No. 27 of the Admonitions
and begins with the words "There is absolutely no man," etc.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[20:4](wosf04.htm#fr_133) Ed. of Venice, 1504,
and of Metz, 1509.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[20:5](wosf04.htm#fr_134) *Opuscula*, Antwerp,
1623.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[20:6](wosf04.htm#fr_135) In the Assisi codex
(as in that of Liegnitz) the title reads: (*Notes 6 and 7 carried
forward to next page*.) <span id="page_21">p. 21</span> "Of the virtues
with which the Blessed Virgin Mary was adorned and with which a holy
soul ought also to be adorned," whereas in the Ognissanti codex and
others of the same class, the title is: "Salutation of the Virtues and
of their efficacy in confounding Vice." (See Introduction.)

<span id="fn_136"></span>[20:7](wosf04.htm#fr_136) Cod. As. omits
"Hail."
