# Apostles' Creed

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1\. I believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:

2\. And in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord:

3\. Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary:

4\. Suffered under Pontius Pilate; was crucified, dead and buried: He
descended into hell:

5\. The third day he rose again from the dead:

6\. He ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the
Father Almighty:

7\. From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead:

8\. I believe in the Holy Ghost:

9\. I believe in the holy catholic church: the communion of saints:

10\. The forgiveness of sins:

1l. The resurrection of the body:

12\. And the life everlasting. Amen.
