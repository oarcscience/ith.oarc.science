<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Chapter XVI - The Apocalypse</H1>
<P><P><A NAME="pg_558"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 558</FONT></A></P><P>Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at
hand.--REVELATION.
<P>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God,
in the mountain of His holiness.--PSALMS.
<P><P>ST. JOHN writes, in the tenth chapter of his book of
Revelation : <P><P>And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven,
clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and
his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of
fire: and he had in his hand a little book open: and he
set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the
earth.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The new Evangel</FONT></P>
This angel or message which comes from God, clothed
with a cloud, prefigures divine Science. To mortal sense
Science seems at first obscure, abstract, and
dark; but a bright promise crowns its brow.
When understood, it is Truth's prism and praise. When
you look it fairly in the face, you can heal by its means,
and it has for you a light above the sun, for God "is the
light thereof." Its feet are pillars of fire, foundations
of Truth and Love. It brings the baptism of the Holy
Ghost, whose flames of Truth were prophetically described by John the Baptist as consuming error.
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_559"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 559</FONT></A></P><P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Truth's volume</FONT></P>
This angel had in his hand "a little book," open for 
all to read and understand. Did this same book contain
the revelation of divine Science, the "right 
foot" or dominant power of which was upon 
the sea,--upon elementary, latent error, the source of
all error's visible forms? The angel's left foot was upon 
the earth; that is, a secondary power was exercised upon
visible error and audible sin. The "still, small voice"
of scientific thought reaches over continent and ocean 
to the globe's remotest bound. The inaudible voice of
Truth is, to the human mind, "as when a lion roareth."
It is heard in the desert and in dark places of fear. It 
arouses the "seven thunders" of evil, and stirs their latent
forces to utter the full diapason of secret tones. Then is
the power of Truth demonstrated,--made manifest in
the destruction of error. Then will a voice from harmony
cry: "Go and take the little book. . . . Take it, and eat
it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in 
thy mouth sweet as honey." Mortals, obey the heavenly
evangel. Take divine Science. Read this book from
beginning to end. Study it, ponder it. It will be indeed 
sweet at its first taste, when it heals you; but murmur not
over Truth, if you find its digestion bitter. When you
approach nearer and nearer to this divine Principle, when 
you eat the divine body of this Principle, - thus partaking of the nature, or primal elements, of Truth and Love,
- do not be surprised nor discontented because you must 
share the hemlock cup and eat the bitter herbs; for the
Israelites of old at the Paschal meal thus prefigured this
perilous passage out of bondage into the El Dorado of faith 
and hope.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>To-day's lesson</FONT></P>
The twelfth chapter of the Apocalypse, or Revela<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_560"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 560</FONT></A></P><P><P>tion of St. John, has a special suggestiveness in connection with the nineteenth century. In the opening of the
sixth seal, typical of six thousand years since
Adam, the distinctive feature has reference
to the present age.
<P><P>Revelation xii. 1. And there appeared a great wonder in
heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon
under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve
stars.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>True estimate of God's messenger</FONT></P>
Heaven represents harmony, and divine Science interprets the Principle of heavenly harmony. The great
miracle, to human sense, is divine Love, and
the grand necessity of existence is to gain the
true idea of what constitutes the kingdom of
heaven in man. This goal is never reached while we
hate our neighbor or entertain a false estimate of anyone whom God has appointed to voice His Word. Again,
without a correct sense of its highest visible idea, we can
never understand the divine Principle. The botanist must
know the genus and species of a plant in order to classify
it correctly. As it is with things, so is it with persons.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Persecution harmful</FONT></P>
Abuse of the motives and religion of St. Paul hid from
view the apostle's character, which made him equal to
his great mission. Persecution of all who have
spoken something new and better of God has
not only obscured the light of the ages, but has been fatal
to the persecutors. Why? Because it has hid from
them the true idea which has been presented. To misunderstand Paul, was to be ignorant of the divine idea he
taught. Ignorance of the divine idea betrays at once a
greater ignorance of the divine Principle of the idea - igno<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_561"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 561</FONT></A></P><P><P>rance of Truth and Love. The understanding of Truth 
and Love, the Principle which works out the ends of eternal
good and destroys both faith in evil and the practice of 
evil, leads to the discernment of the divine idea.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Espousals supernal</FONT></P>
Agassiz, through his microscope, saw the sun in an
egg at a point of so-called embryonic life. Because of
his more spiritual vision, St. John saw an 
"angel standing in the sun." The Revelator 
beheld the spiritual idea from the mount of vision. 
Purity was the symbol of Life and Love. The Revelator
saw also the spiritual ideal as a woman clothed in light, a
bride coming down from heaven, wedded to the Lamb 
of Love. To John, "the bride" and "the Lamb" represented the correlation of divine Principle and spiritual idea,
God and His Christ, bringing harmony to earth. 
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Divinity and humanity </FONT></P>
John saw the human and divine coincidence, shown in
the man Jesus, as divinity embracing humanity in Life
and its demonstration,--reducing to human 
perception and understanding the Life which 
is God. In divine revelation, material and corporeal selfhood disappear, and the spiritual idea is understood. 
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Spiritual sunlight </FONT></P>
The woman in the Apocalypse symbolizes generic man,
the spiritual idea of God; she illustrates the coincidence
of God and man as the divine Principle and 
divine idea. The Revelator symbolizes Spirit 
by the sun. The spiritual idea is clad with the radiance
of spiritual Truth, and matter is put under her feet. The 
light portrayed is really neither solar nor lunar, but spiritual Life, which is "the light of men." In the first chapter
of the Fourth Gospel it is written, "There was a man sent 
from God . . . to bear witness of that Light."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Spiritual idea revealed</FONT></P>
John the Baptist prophesied the coming of the im<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_562 "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 562 </FONT></A></P><P><P>maculate Jesus, and John saw in those days the spiritual
idea as the Messiah, who would baptize with the Holy
Ghost,--divine Science. As Elias presented
the idea of the fatherhood of God, which Jesus
afterwards manifested, so the Revelator completed this
figure with woman, typifying the spiritual idea of God's
motherhood. The moon is under her feet. This idea
reveals the universe as secondary and tributary to Spirit,
from which the universe borrows its reflected light, substance, life, and intelligence.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Spiritual idea crowned</FONT></P>
The spiritual idea is crowned with twelve stars. The
twelve tribes of Israel with all mortals,--separated by
belief from man's divine origin and the true
idea,--will through much tribulation yield to
the activities of the divine Principle of man in the harmony of Science. These are the stars in the crown of
rejoicing. They are the lamps in the spiritual heavens
of the age, which show the workings of the spiritual idea
by healing the sick and the sinning, and by manifesting
the light which shines "unto the perfect day" as the night
of materialism wanes.
<P><P>Revelation xii. 2. And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Travail and joy</FONT></P>
Also the spiritual idea is typified by a woman in travail, waiting to be delivered of her sweet promise, but remembering no more her sorrow for joy that
the birth goes on; for great is the idea, and the
travail portentous.
<P><P>Revelation xii. 3. And there appeared another wonder in
heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads
and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_563"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 563</FONT></A></P><P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The dragon as a type</FONT></P>
Human sense may well marvel at discord, while, to a 
diviner sense., harmony is the real and discord the unreal.
We may well be astonished at sin, sickness, and 
death. We may well be perplexed at human 
fear; and still more astounded at hatred, which lifts
its hydra head, showing its horns in the many inventions 
of evil. But why should we stand aghast at nothingness?
The great red dragon symbolizes a lie,--the belief
that substance, life, and intelligence can be material. 
This dragon stands for the sum total of human error.
The ten horns of the dragon typify the belief that matter has power of its own, and that by means of an 
evil mind in matter the Ten Commandments can be
broken.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The sting of the serpent</FONT></P>
The Revelator lifts the veil from this embodiment of 
all evil, and beholds its awful character; but he also
sees the nothingness of evil and the allness of 
God. The Revelator sees that old serpent, 
whose name is devil or evil, holding untiring watch, that
he may bite the heel of truth and seemingly impede the
offspring of the spiritual idea, which is prolific in health, 
holiness, and immortality.
<P><P>Revelation xii. 4. And his tail drew the third part of the
stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the 
dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be
delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Animal tendency</FONT></P>
The serpentine form stands for subtlety, winding its 
way amidst all evil, but doing this in the name of good.
Its sting is spoken of by Paul, when he refers 
to "spiritual wickedness in high places." It 
is the animal instinct in mortals, which would impel
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_564"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 564</FONT></A></P><P><P>them to devour each other and cast out devils through
Beelzebub.
<P><P>As of old, evil still charges the spiritual idea with error's
own nature and methods. This malicious animal instinct, of which the dragon is the type, incites mortals to
kill morally and physically even their fellow-mortals, and
worse still, to charge the innocent with the crime. This
last infirmity of sin will sink its perpetrator into a night
without a star.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Malicious barbarity</FONT></P>
The author is convinced that the accusations against
Jesus of Nazareth and even his crucifixion were instigated
by the criminal instinct here described. The
Revelator speaks of Jesus as the Lamb of God
and of the dragon as warring against innocence. Since Jesus
must have been tempted in all points, he, the immaculate,
met and conquered sin in every form. The brutal barbarity of his foes could emanate from no source except the
highest degree of human depravity. Jesus "opened not
his mouth." Until the majesty of Truth should be demonstrated in divine Science, the spiritual idea was arraigned
before the tribunal of so-called mortal mind, which was
unloosed in order that the false claim of mind in matter
might uncover its own crime of defying immortal Mind.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Doom of the dragon</FONT></P>
From Genesis to the Apocalypse, sin, sickness, and
death, envy, hatred, and revenge, - all evil, - are typified by a serpent, or animal subtlety. Jesus
said, quoting a line from the Psalms, "They
hated me without a cause." The serpent is perpetually
close upon the heel of harmony. From the beginning
to the end, the serpent pursues with hatred the spiritual
idea. In Genesis, this allegorical, talking serpent typifies mortal mind, "more subtle than any beast of the
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_565"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 565</FONT></A></P><P><P>field." In the Apocalypse, when nearing its doom, this 
evil increases and becomes the great red dragon, swollen
with sin, inflamed with war against spirituality, and ripe 
for destruction. It is full of lust and hate, loathing the
brightness of divine glory.
<P><P>Revelation xii. 5. And she brought forth a man child, 
who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her
child was caught up unto God, and to His throne.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The conflict with purity</FONT></P>
Led on by the grossest element of mortal mind, Herod 
decreed the death of every male child in order that the
man Jesus, the masculine representative of the 
spiritual idea might never hold sway and deprive Herod of his crown.  The impersonation of the
spiritual idea had a brief history in the earthly life of our
Master; but "of his kingdom there shall be no end," 
for Christ, God's idea, will eventually rule all nations
and peoples - imperatively, absolutely, finally - with divine Science. This immaculate idea, represented first 
by man and, according to the Revelator, last by woman,
will baptize with fire; and the fiery baptism will burn up
the chaff of error with the fervent heat of Truth and Love, 
melting and purifying even the gold of human character.
After the stars sang together and all was primeval harmony, the material lie made war upon the spiritual idea; 
but this only impelled the idea to rise to the zenith of
demonstration, destroying sin, sickness, and death, and
to be caught up unto God,--to be found in its divine
Principle.
<P><P>Revelation xii. 6. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God.  
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_566 "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 566 </FONT></A></P><P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Spiritual guidance</FONT></P>
As the children of Israel were guided triumphantly
through the Red Sea, the dark ebbing and flowing tides
of human fear,--as they were led through the
wilderness, walking wearily through the great
desert of human hopes, and anticipating the promised
joy,--so shall the spiritual idea guide all right desires
in their passage from sense to Soul, from a material sense
of existence to the spiritual, up to the glory prepared for
them who love God. Stately Science pauses not, but
moves before them, a pillar of cloud by day and of fire
by night, leading to divine heights.
<P><P>If we remember the beautiful description which Sir
Walter Scott puts into the mouth of Rebecca the Jewess
in the story of Ivanhoe, <P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Israel, of the Lord beloved,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the land of bondage came,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her fathers' God before her moved,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An awful guide, in smoke and flame, -<BR>
<P><P>we may also offer the prayer which concludes the same
hymn, <P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oh, when stoops on Judah's path<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In shade and storm the frequent night,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be Thou, longsuffering, slow to wrath,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burning and a shining light!<BR>
<P><P>Revelation xii. 7, 8. And there was war in heaven:
Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the
dragon fought, and his angels, and prevailed not; neither
was their place found any more in heaven.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Angelic offices</FONT></P>
The Old Testament assigns to the angels, God's divine
messages, different offices. Michael's characteristic is spiritual strength. He leads the
hosts of heaven against the power of sin, Satan, and
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_567"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 567</FONT></A></P><P><P>fights the holy wars. Gabriel has the more quiet task 
of imparting a sense of the ever-presence of ministering
Love. These angels deliver us from the depths. Truth 
and Love come nearer in the hour of woe, when strong
faith or spiritual strength wrestles and prevails through
the understanding of God. The Gabriel of His presence 
has no contests. To infinite, ever-present Love, all is
Love, and there is no error, no sin, sickness, nor death.
Against Love, the dragon warreth not long, for he is 
killed by the divine Principle. Truth and Love prevail
against the dragon because the dragon cannot war with
them. Thus endeth the conflict between the flesh and 
Spirit.
<P><P>Revelation xii. 9. And the great dragon was cast out,
that old serpent, called the devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his
angels were cast out with him.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Dragon cast down to earth</FONT></P>
That false claim--that ancient belief, that old serpent 
whose name is devil (evil), claiming that there is intelligence in matter either to benefit or to injure 
men--is pure delusion, the red dragon; and 
it is cast out by Christ, Truth, the spiritual 
idea, and so proved to be powerless. The words "cast
unto the earth" show the dragon to be nothingness, dust
to dust; and therefore, in his pretence of being a talker,
he must be a lie from the beginning. His angels, or messages, are cast out with their author. The beast and the 
false prophets are lust and hypocrisy. These wolves in
sheep's clothing are detected and killed by innocence, the
Lamb of Love.  
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Warfare with error    </FONT></P>
Divine Science shows how the Lamb slays the wolf.
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_568"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 568</FONT></A></P><P><P>Innocence and Truth overcome guilt and error. Ever
since the foundation of the world, ever since error would
establish material belief, evil has tried to slay
the Lamb; but Science is able to destroy this
lie, called evil. The twelfth chapter of the Apocalypse
typifies the divine method of warfare in Science, and the
glorious results of this warfare. The following chapters
depict the fatal effects of trying to meet error with error.
The narrative follows the order used in Genesis. In
Genesis, first the true method of creation is set forth and
then the false. Here, also, the Revelator first exhibits
the true warfare and then the false.
<P><P>Revelation xii. 10--12. And I heard a loud voice saying
in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the
kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ: for the
accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them
before our God day and night. And they overcame him by
the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony;
and they loved not their lives unto the death. Therefore
rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the
inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is
come down unto you, having great wrath, because he
knoweth that he hath but a short time.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Paean of jubilee</FONT></P>
For victory over a single sin, we give thanks and magnify the Lord of Hosts. What shall we say of the mighty
conquest over all sin? A louder song, sweeter
than has ever before reached high heaven,
now rises clearer and nearer to the great heart of Christ;
for the accuser is not there, and Love sends forth her
primal and everlasting strain. Self-abnegation, by which
we lay down all for Truth, or Christ, in our warfare against
error, is a rule in Christian Science. This rule clearly
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_569"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 569</FONT></A></P><P><P>interprets God as divine Principle,--as Life, represented 
by the Father; as Truth, represented by the Son; as Love,
represented by the Mother. Every mortal at some period, 
here or hereafter, must grapple with and overcome the
mortal belief in a power opposed to God.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The robe of Science</FONT></P>
The Scripture, "Thou hast been faithful over a few 
things, I will make thee ruler over many," is literally fulfilled, when we are conscious of the supremacy 
of Truth, by which the nothingness of error 
is seen; and we know that the nothingness of error is in
proportion to its wickedness. He that touches the hem
of Christ's robe and masters his mortal beliefs, animality, 
and hate, rejoices in the proof of healing,--in a sweet
and certain sense that God is Love. Alas for those who
break faith with divine Science and fail to strangle the 
serpent of sin as well as of sickness! They are dwellers
still in the deep darkness of belief. They are in the surging sea of error, not struggling to lift their heads above the 
drowning wave.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Expiation by suffering</FONT></P>
What must the end be? They must eventually expiate their sin through suffering. The sin, which one has 
made his bosom companion, comes back to him 
at last with accelerated force, for the devil
knoweth his time is short. Here the Scriptures declare
that evil is temporal, not eternal. The dragon is at last
stung to death by his own malice; but how many periods
of torture it may take to remove all sin, must depend upon 
sin's obduracy.
<P><P>Revelation xii. 13. And when the dragon saw that he
was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which 
brought forth the man child.
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_570"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 570</FONT></A></P><P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Apathy to occultism</FONT></P>
The march of mind and of honest investigation will
bring the hour when the people will chain, with fetters of
some sort, the growing occultism of this period.
The present apathy as to the tendency of
certain active yet unseen mental agencies will finally be
shocked into another extreme mortal mood,--into human
indignation; for one extreme follows another.
<P><P>Revelation xii. 15, 16. And the serpent cast out of his
mouth water as a flood, after the woman, that he might
cause her to be carried away of the flood. And the earth
helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and
swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his
mouth.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Receptive hearts</FONT></P>
Millions of unprejudiced minds--simple seekers for
Truth, weary wanderers, athirst in the desert - are waiting and watching for rest and drink. Give
them a cup of cold water in Christ's name,
and never fear the consequences. What if the old dragon
should send forth a new flood to drown the Christ-idea?
He can neither drown your voice with its roar, nor again
sink the world into the deep waters of chaos and old night.
In this age the earth will help the woman; the spiritual
idea will be understood. Those ready for the blessing
you impart will give thanks. The waters will be pacified, and Christ will command the wave.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Hidden ways of iniquity</FONT></P>
When God heals the sick or the sinning, they should
know the great benefit which Mind has wrought. They
should also know the great delusion of mortal mind, when it makes them sick or sinful.
Many are willing to open the eyes of the people to the
power of good resident in divine Mind, but they are
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_571"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 571</FONT></A></P><P><P>not so willing to point out the evil in human thought,
and expose evil's hidden mental ways of accomplishing
iniquity.   
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Christly warning   </FONT></P>
Why this backwardness, since exposure is necessary
to ensure the avoidance of the evil? Because people like
you better when you tell them their virtues 
than when you tell them their vices. It requires the spirit of our blessed Master to tell a man his
faults, and so risk human displeasure for the sake of doing
right and benefiting our race. Who is telling mankind
of the foe in ambush? Is the informer one who sees the
foe? If so, listen and be wise. Escape from evil, and 
designate those as unfaithful stewards who have seen the
danger and yet have given no warning.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The armor of divinity</FONT></P>
At all times and under all circumstances, overcome 
evil with good. Know thyself, and God will supply
the wisdom and the occasion for a victory 
over evil. Clad in the panoply of Love, 
human hatred cannot reach you. The cement of a
higher humanity will unite all interests in the one
divinity. 
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Pure religion enthroned      </FONT></P>
Through trope and metaphor, the Revelator, immortal
scribe of Spirit and of a true idealism, furnishes the
mirror in which mortals may see their own 
image. In significant figures he depicts the 
thoughts which he beholds in mortal mind. Thus he
rebukes the conceit of sin, and foreshadows  its doom. 
With his spiritual strength, he has opened wide the gates
of glory, and illumined the night of paganism with the
sublime grandeur of divine Science, outshining sin, sorcery, 
lust, and hypocrisy. He takes away mitre and sceptre.
He enthrones pure and undefiled religion, and lifts on
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_572 "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 572 </FONT></A></P><P><P>high only those who have washed their robes white in
obedience and suffering.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Native nothingness of sin</FONT></P>
Thus we see, in both the first and last books of the
Bible,--in Genesis and in the Apocalypse,--that sin
is to be Christianly and scientifically reduced
to its native nothingness. "Love one another" (I John, iii. 23), is the most simple and profound
counsel of the inspired writer. In Science we are children of God; but whatever is of material sense, or mortal, belongs not to His children, for materiality is the
inverted image of spirituality.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Fulfilment of the Law</FONT></P>
Love fulfils the law of Christian Science, and nothing
short of this divine Principle, understood and demonstrated, can ever furnish the vision of the
Apocalypse, open the seven seals of error with
Truth, or uncover the myriad illusions of sin, sickness,
and death. Under the supremacy of Spirit, it will be seen
and acknowledged that matter must disappear.
<P><P>In Revelation xxi. 1 we read: <P><P>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first
heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was
no more sea.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Man's present possibilities</FONT></P>
The Revelator had not yet passed the transitional
stage in human experience called death, but he already
saw a new heaven and a new earth. Through
what sense came this vision to St. John? Not
through the material visual organs for seeing, for optics
are inadequate to take in so wonderful a scene. Were this
new heaven and new earth terrestrial or celestial, mate<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_573"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 573</FONT></A></P><P><P>rial or spiritual? They could not be the former, for the
human sense of space is unable to grasp such a view.
The Revelator was on our plane of existence, while yet
beholding what the eye cannot see, - that which is invisible to the uninspired thought. This testimony of Holy
Writ sustains the fact in Science, that the heavens and 
earth to one human consciousness, that consciousness
which God bestows, are spiritual, while to another, the
unillumined human mind, the vision is material.  This
shows unmistakably that what the human mind terms
matter and spirit indicates states and stages of consciousness.   
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Nearness of Deity   </FONT></P>
Accompanying this scientific consciousness was another revelation, even the declaration from heaven, supreme harmony, that God, the divine Principle 
of harmony, is ever with men, and they are 
His people. Thus man was no longer regarded as a miserable sinner, but as the blessed child of God. Why? 
Because St. John's corporeal sense of the heavens and
earth had vanished, and in place of this false sense was
the spiritual sense, the subjective state by which he could 
see the new heaven and new earth, which involve the
spiritual idea and consciousness of reality. This is Scriptural authority for concluding that such a recognition of 
being is, and has been, possible to men in this present
state of existence,--that we can become conscious,
here and now, of a cessation of death, sorrow, and pain. 
This is indeed a foretaste of absolute Christian Science.
Take heart, dear sufferer, for this reality of being will
surely appear sometime and in some way. There will 
be no more pain, and all tears will be wiped away. When
you read this, remember Jesus' words, "The kingdom of
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_574"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 574</FONT></A></P><P><P>God is within you." This spiritual consciousness is
therefore a present possibility.
<P><P>The Revelator also takes in another view, adapted to
console the weary pilgrim, journeying " uphill all the way."
<P><P>He writes, in Revelation xxi. 9: <P><P>And there came unto me one of the seven angels which
had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked
with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride,
the Lamb's wife.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Vials of wrath and consolation</FONT></P>
This ministry of Truth, this message from divine Love,
carried John away in spirit. It exalted him till he became conscious of the spiritual facts of being
and the "New Jerusalem, coming down from
God, out of heaven," - the spiritual outpouring of bliss and glory, which he describes as the city
which "lieth foursquare." The beauty of this text is,
that the sum total of human misery, represented by
the seven angelic vials full of seven plagues, has full
compensation in the law of Love. Note this,--that the
very message, or swift-winged thought, which poured
forth hatred and torment, brought also the experience
which at last lifted the seer to behold the great city, the
four equal sides of which were heaven-bestowed and
heaven-bestowing.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Spiritual wedlock</FONT></P>
Think of this, dear reader, for it will lift the sackcloth from your eyes, and you will behold the softwinged dove descending upon you. The very
circumstance, which your suffering sense
deems wrathful and afflictive, Love can make an angel
entertained unawares. Then thought gently whispers:
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_575"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 575</FONT></A></P><P><P>"Come hither! Arise from your false consciousness  
into the true sense of Love, and behold the Lamb's
wife,--Love wedded to its own spiritual idea." Then 
cometh the marriage feast, for this revelation will destroy forever the physical plagues imposed by material
sense. 
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The city foursquare      </FONT></P>
This sacred city, described in the Apocalypse (xxi. 16)
as one that "lieth foursquare" and cometh "down from
God, out of heaven," represents the light and 
glory of divine Science. The builder and 
maker of this New Jerusalem is God, as we read in the
book of Hebrews; and it is "a city which hath foundations." The description is metaphoric. Spiritual teaching must always be by symbols. Did not Jesus illustrate
the truths he taught by the mustard-seed and the prodigal? Taken in its allegorical sense, the description of
the city as foursquare has a profound meaning. The
four sides of our city are the Word, Christ, Christianity, 
and divine Science; "and the gates of it shall not be shut
at all by day: for there shall be no night there." This
city is wholly spiritual, as its four sides indicate. 
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The royally divine gates </FONT></P>
As the Psalmist saith, "Beautiful for situation, the
joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of
the north, the city of the great King." It is 
indeed a city of the Spirit, fair, royal, and 
square. Northward, its gates open to the North Star,
the Word, the polar magnet of Revelation; eastward, 
to the star seen by the Wisemen of the Orient, who followed it to the manger of Jesus; southward, to the
genial tropics, with the Southern Cross in the skies,
- the Cross of Calvary, which binds human society
into solemn union; westward, to the grand realization
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_576"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 576</FONT></A></P><P><P>of the Golden Shore of Love and the Peaceful Sea of
Harmony.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Revelation's pure zenith</FONT></P>
This heavenly city, lighted by the Sun of Righteousness,--this New Jerusalem, this infinite All, which to
us seems hidden in the mist of remoteness, reached St. John's vision while yet he tabernacled with mortals.
<P><P>In Revelation xxi. 22, further describing this holy city,
the beloved Disciple writes: <P><P>And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty
and the Lamb are the temple of it.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The shrine celestial</FONT></P>
There was no temple,--that is, no material structure
in which to worship God, for He must be worshipped
in spirit and in love. The word temple also
means body. The Revelator was familiar
with Jesus' use of this word, as when Jesus spoke of his
material body as the temple to be temporarily rebuilt
(John ii. 21). What further indication need we of the
real man's incorporeality than this, that John saw
heaven and earth with "no temple [body] therein"?
This kingdom of God "is within you,"--is within
reach of man's consciousness here, and the spiritual
idea reveals it. In divine Science, man possesses this
recognition of harmony consciously in proportion to his
understanding of God.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Divine sense of Deity</FONT></P>
The term Lord, as used in our version of the Old
Testament, is often synonymous with Jehovah, and expresses the Jewish concept, not yet elevated
to deific apprehension through spiritual transfiguration. Yet the word gradually approaches a higher
meaning. This human sense of Deity yields to the divine
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_577"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 577</FONT></A></P><P><P>sense, even as the material sense of personality yields 
to the incorporeal sense of God and man as the infinite
Principle and infinite idea, - as one Father with His universal family, held in the gospel of Love. The Lamb's
wife presents the unity of male and female as no longer
two wedded individuals, but as two individual natures 
in one; and this compounded spiritual individuality reflects God as Father-Mother, not as a corporeal being.
In this divinely united spiritual consciousness, there is no 
impediment to eternal bliss,--to the perfectibility of
God's creation.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The city of our God</FONT></P>
This spiritual, holy habitation has no boundary 
nor limit, but its four cardinal points are: first, the
Word of Life, Truth, and Love; second,
the Christ, the spiritual idea of God; third,
Christianity, which is the outcome of the divine Principle of the Christ-idea in Christian history; fourth,
Christian Science, which to-day and forever interprets 
this great example and the great Exemplar. This city
of our God has no need of sun or satellite, for Love
is the light of it, and divine Mind is its own interpreter.
All who are saved must walk in this light. Mighty
potentates and dynasties will lay down their honors
within the heavenly city. Its gates open towards light 
and glory both within and without, for all is good, and
nothing can enter that city, which "defileth. . . . or
maketh a lie."
   
The writer's present feeble sense of Christian Science
closes with St. John's Revelation as recorded by the
great apostle, for his vision is the acme of this Science 
as the Bible reveals it.
<P><P>In the following Psalm one word shows, though faintly,
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_578"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 578</FONT></A></P><P><P>the light which Christian Science throws on the Scriptures
by substituting for the corporeal sense, the incorporeal
or spiritual sense of Deity: <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSALM XXIII
<P>[DIVINE LOVE] is my shepherd; I shall not want.
<P>[LOVE] maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
<P>[LOVE] leadeth me beside the still waters.
<P>[LOVE] restoreth my soul [spiritual sense]: [Love] leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake.
<P>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
death, I will fear no evil: for [LOVE] is with me; [LOVE's]
rod and [LOVE'S] staff they comfort me.
<P>[LOVE] prepareth a table before me in the presence of
mine enemies: [LOVE] anointeth my head with oil; my cup
runneth over.
<P>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of
my life; and I will dwell in the house [the consciousness]
of [LOVE] for ever.
