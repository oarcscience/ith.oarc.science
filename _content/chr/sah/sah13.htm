<P><P><A NAME="pg_443"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 443</FONT></A></P><P><P>Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just
man, and he will increase in learning.--PROVERBS.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Study of medicine</FONT></P>
WHEN the discoverer of Christian Science is consulted by her followers as to the propriety, advantage, and consistency of systematic medical 
study, she tries to show them that under ordinary circumstances a resort to faith in corporeal means
tends to deter those, who make such a compromise, from 
entire confidence in omnipotent Mind as really possessing
all power. While a course of medical study is at times
severely condemned by some Scientists, she feels, as she 
always has felt, that all are privileged to work out their
own salvation according to their light, and that our motto
should be the Master's counsel, "Judge not, that ye be 
not judged."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Failure's lessons</FONT></P>
If patients fail to experience the healing power of
Christian Science, and think they can be benefited by 
certain ordinary physical methods of medical
treatment, then the Mind-physician should 
give up such cases, and leave invalids free to resort to 
whatever other systems they fancy will afford relief.
Thus such invalids may learn the value of the apostolic
precept: "Reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering 
and doctrine." If the sick find these material expedients
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_444  "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 444  </FONT></A></P><P><P>unsatisfactory, and they receive no help from them, these
very failures may open their blind eyes. In some way,
sooner or later, all must rise superior to materiality, and
suffering is oft the divine agent in this elevation. "All
things work together for good to them that love God," is
the dictum of Scripture.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Refuge and strength</FONT></P>
If Christian Scientists ever fail to receive aid from
other Scientists,--their brethren upon whom they may
call,--God will still guide them into the right
use of temporary and eternal means. Step by
step will those who trust Him find that "God is our refuge
and strength, a very present help in trouble."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Charity to those opposed</FONT></P>
Students are advised by the author to be charitable
and kind, not only towards differing forms of religion
and medicine, but to those who hold these differing opinions. Let us be faithful in pointing
the way through Christ, as we understand it,
but let us also be careful always to "judge righteous judgment," and never to condemn rashly. "Whosoever shall
smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."
That is, Fear not that he will smite thee again for thy forbearance. If ecclesiastical sects or medical schools turn
a deaf ear to the teachings of Christian Science, then part
from these opponents as did Abraham when he parted
from Lot, and say in thy heart: "Let there be no strife, I
pray thee, between me and thee, and between My herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren." Immortals,
or God's children in divine Science, are one harmonious
family; but mortals, or the "children of men" in material
sense, are discordant and ofttimes false brethren.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Conforming to explicit rules</FONT></P>
The teacher must make clear to students the Science
of healing, especially its ethics,--that all is Mind, and
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_445"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 445</FONT></A></P><P><P>that the Scientist must conform to God's requirements. 
Also the teacher must thoroughly fit his students to defend
themselves against sin, and to guard against the 
attacks of the would-be mental assassin, who
attempts to kill morally and physically. No  
hypothesis as to the existence of another power should
interpose a doubt or fear to hinder the demonstration of
Christian Science. Unfold the latent energies and capacities for good in your pupil. Teach the great possibilities 
of man endued with divine Science. Teach the dangerous
possibility of dwarfing the spiritual understanding and
demonstration of Truth by sin, or by recourse to material 
means for healing. Teach the meekness and might of life
"hid with Christ in God," and there will be no desire for
other healing methods. You render the divine law of 
healing obscure and void, when you weigh the human in
the scale with the divine, or limit in any direction of
thought the omnipresence and omnipotence of God. 
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Divine energy  </FONT></P>
Christian Science silences human will, quiets fear with
Truth and Love, and illustrates the unlabored motion
of the divine energy in healing the sick. Self-  
seeking, envy, passion, pride, hatred, and 
revenge are cast out by the divine Mind which heals
disease. The human will which maketh and worketh a lie, 
hiding the divine Principle of harmony, is destructive to
health, and is the cause of disease rather than its cure.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Blight of avarice</FONT></P>
There is great danger in teaching Mind-healing indiscriminately, thus disregarding the morals of the student
and caring only for the fees. Recalling Jefferson's words about slavery, "I tremble, when I 
remember that God is just," the author trembles whenever
she sees a man, for the petty consideration of money,
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_446"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 446</FONT></A></P><P><P>teaching his slight knowledge of Mind-power, - perhaps communicating his own bad morals, and in this way
dealing pitilessly with a community unprepared for selfdefence.
<P><P>A thorough perusal of the author's publications heals
sickness. If patients sometimes seem worse while reading this book, the change may either arise from the alarm
of the physician, or it may mark the crisis of the disease.
Perseverance in the perusal of the book has generally
completely healed such cases.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Exclusion of malpractice</FONT></P>
Whoever practises the Science the author teaches,
through which Mind pours light and healing upon this
generation, can practise on no one from sinister or malicious motives without destroying
his own power to heal and his own health. Good must
dominate in the thoughts of the healer, or his demonstration is protracted, dangerous, and impossible in Science. A wrong motive involves defeat. In the Science
of Mind-healing, it is imperative to be honest, for victory
rests on the side of immutable right. To understand
God strengthens hope, enthrones faith in Truth, and
verifies Jesus' word: "Lo, I am with you alway, even
unto the end of the world."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Iniquity overcome</FONT></P>
Resisting evil, you overcome it and prove its nothingness. Not human platitudes, but divine beatitudes, reflect the spiritual light and might which heal
the sick. The exercise of will brings on a
hypnotic state, detrimental to health and integrity of
thought. This must therefore be watched and guarded
against. Covering iniquity will prevent prosperity and the
ultimate triumph of any cause. Ignorance of the error
to be eradicated oftentimes subjects you to its abuse.
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_447"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 447</FONT></A></P><P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>No trespass on human rights</FONT></P>
The heavenly law is broken by trespassing upon 
man's individual right of self-government. We have no
authority in Christian Science and no moral 
right to attempt to influence the thoughts of  
others, except it be to benefit them. In mental practice you must not forget that erring human opinions, conflicting selfish motives, and ignorant attempts
to do good may render you incapable of knowing or
judging accurately the need of your fellow-men. Therefore the rule is, heal the sick when called upon for aid,
and save the victims of the mental assassins.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Expose sin without believing in it</FONT></P>
Ignorance, subtlety, or false charity does not forever conceal error; evil will in time disclose and punish itself. The recuperative action of the
system, when mentally sustained by Truth, 
goes on naturally. When sin or sickness the reverse of harmony--seems true to material sense,
impart without frightening or discouraging the patient the truth and spiritual understanding, which destroy disease. Expose and denounce the claims of
evil and disease in all their forms, but realize no 
reality in them. A sinner is not reformed merely
by assuring him that he cannot be a sinner because
there is no sin. To put down the claim of sin, 
you must detect it, remove the mask, point out the
illusion, and thus get the victory over sin and so prove
its unreality. The sick are not healed merely by 
declaring there is no sickness, but by knowing that
there is none.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Wicked evasions</FONT></P>
A sinner is afraid to cast the first stone. He may 
say, as a subterfuge, that evil is unreal, but to know it,
he must demonstrate his statement. To assume that
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_448 "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 448 </FONT></A></P><P><P>there are no claims of evil and yet to indulge them, is
a moral offence. Blindness and self-righteousness cling
fast to iniquity. When the Publican's wail
went out to the great heart of Love, it won his
humble desire. Evil which obtains in the bodily senses,
but which the heart condemns, has no foundation; but if
evil is uncondemned, it is undenied and nurtured. Under
such circumstances, to say that there is no evil, is an evil
in itself. When needed tell the truth concerning the lie.
Evasion of Truth cripples integrity, and casts thee down
from the pinnacle.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Truth's grand results</FONT></P>
Christian Science rises above the evidence of the corporeal senses; but if you have not risen above sin yourself, do not congratulate yourself upon your
blindness to evil or upon the good you know
and do not. A dishonest position is far from Christianly
scientific. "He that covereth his sins shall not prosper:
but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have
mercy." Try to leave on every student's mind the strong
impress of divine Science, a high sense of the moral and
spiritual qualifications requisite for healing, well knowing
it to be impossible for error, evil, and hate to accomplish
the grand results of Truth and Love. The reception or
pursuit of instructions opposite to absolute Christian
Science must always hinder scientific demonstration.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Adherence to righteousness</FONT></P>
If the student adheres strictly to the teachings of Christian Science and ventures not to break its rules, he cannot fail of success in healing. It is Christian
Science to do right, and nothing short of rightdoing has any claim to the name. To talk the right and
live the wrong is foolish deceit, doing one's self the most
harm. Fettered by sin yourself, it is difficult to free
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_449"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 449</FONT></A></P><P><P>another from the fetters of disease. With your own wrists 
manacled, it is hard to break another's chains. A little
leaven causes the whole mass to ferment. A grain of 
Christian Science does wonders for mortals, so omnipotent is Truth, but more of Christian Science must be
gained in order to continue in well doing.   
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Right adjusts the balance</FONT></P>
The wrong done another reacts most heavily against
one's self. Right adjusts the balance sooner or later.
Think it "easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle," than for you to benefit
yourself by injuring others. Man's moral mercury, rising or falling, registers his healing ability and fitness to 
teach. You should practise well what you know, and
you will then advance in proportion to your honesty
and fidelity,--qualities which insure success in this 
Science; but it requires a higher understanding to teach
this subject properly and correctly than it does to heal
the most difficult case.  
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Inoculation of thought</FONT></P>
The baneful effect of evil associates is less seen than
felt. The inoculation of evil human thoughts ought to
be understood and guarded against. The 
first impression, made on a mind which is 
attracted or repelled according to personal merit or demerit, is a good detective of individual character.  Certain minds meet only to separate through simultaneous
repulsion. They are enemies without the preliminary
offence. The impure are at peace with the impure. 
Only virtue is a rebuke to vice. A proper teacher of Christian Science improves the health and the morals of his
student if the student practises what he is taught, and 
unless this result follows, the teacher is a Scientist only
in name.
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_450"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 450</FONT></A></P><P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Three classes of neophytes</FONT></P>
There is a large class of thinkers whose bigotry and
conceit twist every fact to suit themselves. Their creed
teaches belief in a mysterious, supernatural
God, and in a natural, all-powerful devil. Another class, still more unfortunate, are so depraved that
they appear to be innocent. They utter a falsehood,
while looking you blandly in the face, and they never
fail to stab their benefactor in the back. A third class
of thinkers build with solid masonry. They are sincere,
generous, noble, and are therefore open to the approach
and recognition of Truth. To teach Christian Science
to such as these is no task. They do not incline longingly to error, whine over the demands of Truth, nor
play the traitor for place and power.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Touchstone of Science</FONT></P>
Some people yield slowly to the touch of Truth. Few
yield without a struggle, and many are reluctant to acknowledge that they have yielded; but unless this admission is made, evil will boast
itself above good. The Christian Scientist has enlisted
to lessen evil, disease, and death; and he will overcome
them by understanding their nothingness and the allness
of God, or good. Sickness to him is no less a temptation
than is sin, and he heals them both by understanding
God's power over them. The Christian Scientist knows
that they are errors of belief, which Truth can and will
destroy.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>False claims annihilated</FONT></P>
Who, that has felt the perilous beliefs in life, substance,
and intelligence separated from God, can say that there
is no error of belief? Knowing the claim of
animal magnetism, that all evil combines in
the belief of life, substance, and intelligence in matter,
electricity, animal nature, and organic life, who will deny
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_451"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 451</FONT></A></P><P><P>that these are the errors which Truth must and will annihilate? Christian Scientists must live under the constant pressure of the apostolic command to come out from 
the material world and be separate. They must renounce aggression, oppression and the pride of power.
Christianity, with the crown of Love upon her brow, 
must be their queen of life.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Treasure in heaven</FONT></P>
Students of Christian Science, who start with its letter
and think to succeed without the spirit, will either make 
shipwreck of their faith or be turned sadly 
awry. They must not only seek, but strive, 
to enter the narrow path of Life, for "wide is the gate, 
and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and
many there be which go in thereat." Man walks in the
direction towards which he looks, and where his treasure 
is, there will his heart be also. If our hopes and affections are spiritual, they come from above, not from beneath, and they bear as of old the fruits of the Spirit. 
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Obligations of teachers</FONT></P>
Every Christian Scientist, every conscientious teacher
of the Science of Mind-healing, knows that human will
is not Christian Science, and he must recognize this in order to defend himself from the
influence of human will. He feels morally obligated to
open the eyes of his students that they may perceive the 
nature and methods of error of every sort, especially any
subtle degree of evil, deceived and deceiving. All mental
malpractice arises from ignorance or malice aforethought. 
It is the injurious action of one mortal mind controlling
another from wrong motives, and it is practised either
with a mistaken or a wicked purpose.    
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Indispensable defence</FONT></P>
Show your student that mental malpractice tends to
blast moral sense, health, and the human life. Instruct
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_452  "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 452  </FONT></A></P><P><P>him how to bar the door of his thought against this
seeming power, - a task not difficult, when one understands that evil has in reality no power.
Incorrect reasoning leads to practical error.
The wrong thought should be arrested before it has a
chance to manifest itself.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Egotistic darkness</FONT></P>
Walking in the light, we are accustomed to the light
and require it; we cannot see in darkness. But eyes accustomed to darkness are pained by the light.
When outgrowing the old, you should not fear
to put on the new. Your advancing course may   provoke envy, but it will also attract respect. When error
confronts you, withhold not the rebuke or the explanation which destroys error. Never breathe an immoral
atmosphere, unless in the attempt to purify it. Better is
the frugal intellectual repast with contentment and virtue,
than the luxury of learning with egotism and vice.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Unwarranted expectations</FONT></P>
Right is radical. The teacher must know the truth
himself. He must live it and love it, or he cannot impart
it to others. We soil our garments with conservatism, and afterwards we must wash them
clean. When the spiritual sense of Truth unfolds its
harmonies, you take no risks in the policy of error. Expect to heal simply by repeating the author's words, by
right talking and wrong acting, and you will be disappointed. Such a practice does not demonstrate the
Science by which divine Mind heals the sick.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Reliable authority</FONT></P>
Acting from sinful motives destroys your power of
healing from the right motive. On the other hand, if
you had the inclination or power to practise
wrongly and then should adopt Christian
Science, the wrong power would be destroyed. You do
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_453"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 453</FONT></A></P><P><P>not deny the mathematician's right to distinguish the correct from the incorrect among the examples on the blackboard, nor disbelieve the musician when he distinguishes 
concord from discord. In like manner it should be granted
that the author understands what she is saying.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Winning the field</FONT></P>
Right and wrong, truth and error, will be at strife in 
the minds of students, until victory rests on the side of
invincible truth. Mental chemicalization follows the explanation of Truth, and a higher 
basis is thus won; but with some individuals the morbid
moral or physical symptoms constantly reappear. I
have never witnessed so decided effects from the use of 
material remedies as from the use of spiritual.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Knowledge and honesty</FONT></P>
Teach your student that he must know himself before he can know others and minister to human needs. 
Honesty is spiritual power.  Dishonesty is 
human weakness, which forfeits divine help. 
You uncover sin, not in order to injure, but in order 
to bless the corporeal man; and a right motive has
its reward. Hidden sin is spiritual wickedness in high
places. The masquerader in this Science thanks God 
that there is no evil, yet serves evil in the name of
good.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Metaphysical treatment</FONT></P>
You should treat sickness mentally just as you would 
sin, except that you must not tell the patient that he is
sick nor give names to diseases, for such a 
course increases fear, the foundation of disease, and impresses more deeply the wrong mind-picture.
A Christian Scientist's medicine is Mind, the divine Truth
that makes man free. A Christian Scientist never recommends material hygiene, never manipulates.  He does
not trespass on the rights of mind nor can he practise
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_454"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 454</FONT></A></P><P><P>animal magnetism or hypnotism. It need not be added
that the use of tobacco or intoxicating drinks is not in
harmony with Christian Science.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Impotence of hate</FONT></P>
Teach your students the omnipotence of Truth, which
illustrates the impotence of error. The understanding,
even in a degree, of the divine All-power destroys fear, and plants the feet in the true path,
- the path which leads to the house built without hands
"eternal in the heavens." Human hate has no legitimate mandate and no kingdom. Love is enthroned.
That evil or matter has neither intelligence nor power,
is the doctrine of absolute Christian Science, and this is
the great truth which strips all disguise from error.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Love the incentive</FONT></P>
He, who understands in sufficient degree the Principle of Mind-healing, points out to his student error as
well as truth, the wrong as well as the right
practice. Love for God and man is the true 
incentive in both healing and teaching. Love inspires,
illumines, designates, and leads the way. Right motives
give pinions to thought, and strength and freedom to
speech and action. Love is priestess at the altar of
Truth. Wait patiently for divine Love to move upon the
waters of mortal mind, and form the perfect concept.
Patience must "have her perfect work."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Continuity of interest</FONT></P>
Do not dismiss students at the close of a class term,
feeling that you have no more to do for them. Let your
loving care and counsel support all their feeble 
footsteps, until your students tread firmly in
the straight and narrow way. The superiority of spiritual power over sensuous is the central point of Christian Science. Remember that the letter and mental
argument are only human auxiliaries to aid in bringing
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_455"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 455</FONT></A></P><P><P>thought into accord with the spirit of Truth and Love, 
which heals the sick and the sinner.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Weakness and guilt</FONT></P>
A mental state of self-condemnation and guilt or a 
faltering and doubting trust in Truth are unsuitable
conditions for healing the sick. Such mental
states indicate weakness instead of strength.  
Hence the necessity of being right yourself in order to
teach this Science of healing. You must utilize the moral
might of Mind in order to walk over the waves of error 
and support your claims by demonstration.   If you are
yourself lost in the belief and fear of disease or sin, and
if, knowing the remedy, you fail to use the  energies of 
Mind in your own behalf, you can exercise  little or no
power for others' help. "First cast out the beam out
of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast 
out the mote out of thy brother's eye."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The trust of the All-wise</FONT></P>
The student, who receives his knowledge of Christian
Science, or metaphysical healing, from a human teacher, 
may be mistaken in judgment and demonstration, but God cannot mistake. God selects
for the highest service one who has grown into such a 
fitness for it as renders any abuse of the mission an impossibility. The All-wise does not bestow His highest
trusts upon the unworthy. When He commissions a messenger, it is one who is spiritually near Himself. No person can misuse this mental power, if he is taught of God
to discern it.      
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Integrity assured</FONT></P>
This strong point in Christian Science is not to be
overlooked,--that the same fountain cannot send forth
both sweet waters and bitter. The higher 
your attainment in the Science of mental  
healing and teaching, the more impossible it will be<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_456"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 456</FONT></A></P><P><P>come for you intentionally to influence mankind adverse
to its highest hope and achievement.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Chicanery impossible</FONT></P>
Teaching or practising in the name of Truth, but contrary to its spirit or rules, is most dangerous quackery.
Strict adherence to the divine Principle and
rules of the scientific  method has secured
the only success of the students  of Christian Science.
This alone entitles them to the   high standing which
most of them hold in the community, a reputation experimentally justified by their efforts. Whoever affirms that there is more than one Principle and method
of demonstrating Christian Science greatly errs, ignorantly or intentionally, and separates himself from the
true conception of Christian Science healing and from
its possible demonstration.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>No dishonest concessions</FONT></P>
Any dishonesty in your theory and practice betrays a
gross ignorance of the method of the Christ-cure. Science
makes no concessions to persons or opinions.
One must abide in the morale of truth or he
cannot demonstrate the divine Principle. So long as
matter is the basis of practice, illness cannot be efficaciously treated by the metaphysical process. Truth does
the work, and you must both understand and abide by the
divine Principle of your demonstration.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>This volume indispensable</FONT></P>
A Christian Scientist requires my work SCIENCE AND
HEALTH for his textbook, and so do all his students and
patients. Why? First: Because it is the voice
of Truth to this age, and contains the full
statement of Christian Science, or the Science of healing
through Mind. Second: Because it was the first book
known, containing a thorough statement of Christian
Science. Hence it gave the first rules for demonstrating
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_457"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 457</FONT></A></P><P><P>this Science, and registered the revealed Truth uncontaminated by human hypotheses.   Other works, which
have borrowed from this book without giving it credit, 
have adulterated the Science. Third: Because this book
has done more for teacher and student, for healer and
patient, than has been accomplished by other books. 
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Purity of science</FONT></P>
Since the divine light of Christian Science first dawned
upon the author, she has never used this newly discovered
power in any direction which she fears to have  
fairly understood. Her prime object, since
entering this field of labor, has been to prevent suffering,
not to produce it. That we cannot scientifically both 
cure and cause disease is self-evident. In the legend of
the shield, which led to a quarrel between two knights
because each of them could see but one face of it, both 
sides were beautiful according to their degree; but to
mental malpractice, prolific of evil, there is no good aspect, either silvern or golden.   
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Backsliders and mistakes</FONT></P>
Christian Science is not an exception to the general
rule, that there is no excellence without labor in a direct
line. One cannot scatter his fire, and at the 
same time hit the mark.  To pursue other 
vocations and advance rapidly in the demonstration of
this Science, is not possible. Departing from Christian 
Science, some learners commend diet and hygiene.
They even practise these, intending thereby to initiate
the cure which they mean to complete with Mind, as if 
the non-intelligent could aid Mind!  The Scientist's
demonstration rests on one Principle, and there must
and can be no opposite rule. Let this Principle be applied to the cure of disease without exploiting other
means.
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_458"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 458</FONT></A></P><P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Mental charlatanism</FONT></P>
Mental quackery rests on the same platform as all
other quackery. The chief plank in this platform is the
doctrine that Science has two principles in
partnership, one good and the other evil, one spiritual, the other material,--and that these two
may be simultaneously at work on the sick. This
theory is supposed to favor practice from both a mental
and a material standpoint. Another plank in the platform is this, that error will finally have the same effect
as truth.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Divinity ever ready</FONT></P>
It is anything but scientifically Christian to think of
aiding the divine Principle of healing or of trying to sustain the human body until the divine Mind
is ready to take the case. Divinity is always
ready. Semper paratus is Truth's motto. Having seen
so much suffering from quackery, the author desires to
keep it out of Christian Science. The two-edged sword
of Truth must turn in every direction to guard "the tree
of life."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The panoply of wisdom</FONT></P>
Sin makes deadly thrusts at the Christian Scientist as
ritualism and creed are summoned to give place to higher
law, but Science will ameliorate mortal malice.
The Christianly scientific man reflects the
divine law, thus becoming a law unto himself. He does
violence to no man. Neither is he a false accuser. The
Christian Scientist wisely shapes his course, and is honest and consistent in following the leadings of divine
Mind. He must prove, through living as well as healing and teaching, that Christ's way is the only one
by which mortals are radically saved from sin and
sickness.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Advancement by sacrifice</FONT></P>
Christianity causes men to turn naturally from matter
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_459"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 459</FONT></A></P><P><P>to Spirit, as the flower turns from darkness to light. 
Man then appropriates those things which "eye hath
not seen nor ear heard." Paul and John   
had a clear apprehension that, as mortal man 
achieves no worldly honors except by sacrifice, 
so he must gain heavenly riches by forsaking all worldliness. Then he will have nothing in common with the
worldling's affections, motives, and aims. Judge not the
future advancement of Christian Science by the steps 
already taken, lest you yourself be condemned for failing to take the first step.
<P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Dangerous knowledge</FONT></P>
Any attempt to heal mortals with erring mortal mind, 
instead of resting on the omnipotence of the divine
Mind, must prove abortive. Committing the 
bare process of mental healing to frail mortals, untaught and unrestrained by Christian Science,
is like putting a sharp knife into the hands of a blind
man or a raging maniac, and turning him loose in 
the crowded streets of a city. Whether animated by
malice or ignorance, a false practitioner will work mischief, and ignorance is more harmful than wilful wickedness, when the latter is distrusted and thwarted in its
incipiency.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Certainty of results</FONT></P>
To mortal sense Christian Science seems abstract, but 
the process is simple and the results are sure if the Science
is understood. The tree must be good, which 
produces good fruit. Guided by divine Truth 
and not guesswork, the theologus (that is, the student the Christian and scientific expounder--of the divine
law) treats disease with more certain results than any 
other healer on the globe. The Christian Scientist should
understand and adhere strictly to the rules of divine meta<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_460 "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 460 </FONT></A></P><P><P>physics as laid down in this work, and rest his demonstration on this sure basis.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Ontology defined</FONT></P>
Ontology is defined as "the science of the necessary
constituents and relations of all beings," and it underlies all metaphysical practice. Our system of
Mind-healing rests on the apprehension of the
nature and essence of all being,--on the divine Mind
and Love's essential qualities. Its pharmacy is moral,
and its medicine is intellectual and spiritual, though used
for physical healing. Yet this most fundamental part of
metaphysics is the one most difficult to understand and
demonstrate, for to the material thought all is material,
till such thought is rectified by Spirit.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Mischievous imagination</FONT></P>
Sickness is neither imaginary nor unreal,--that is,
to the frightened, false sense of the patient.  Sickness
is more than fancy; it is solid conviction. It
is therefore to be dealt with through right apprehension of the truth of being. If Christian healing
is abused by mere smatterers in Science, it becomes a
tedious mischief-maker. Instead of scientifically effecting a cure, it starts a petty crossfire over every cripple
and invalid, buffeting them with the superficial and cold
assertion, "Nothing ails you."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Author's early instructions</FONT></P>
When the Science of Mind was a fresh revelation to
the author, she had to impart, while teaching its grand
facts, the hue of spiritual ideas from her own
spiritual condition, and she had to do this orally
through the meagre channel afforded by language and by
her manuscript circulated among the students.  As former beliefs were gradually expelled from her thought, the
teaching became clearer, until finally the shadow of old
errors was no longer cast upon divine Science.
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_461"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 461</FONT></A></P><P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Proof by induction</FONT></P>
I do not maintain that anyone can exist in the flesh 
without food and raiment; but I do believe that the
real man is immortal and that he lives in  
Spirit, not matter. Christian Science must 
be accepted at this period by induction. We admit the
whole, because a part is proved and that part illustrates 
and proves the entire Principle. Christian Science can
be taught only by those who are morally advanced and
spiritually endowed, for it is not superficial, nor is it 
discerned from the standpoint of the human senses.
Only by the illumination of the spiritual sense, can
the light of understanding be thrown upon this Science, 
because Science reverses the evidence before the material
senses and furnishes the eternal interpretation of God and
man.   
<P><P>If you believe that you are sick, should you say, " I am
sick"? No, but you should tell your belief sometimes,
if this be requisite to protect others. If you commit a 
crime, should you acknowledge to yourself that you are
a criminal? Yes. Your responses should differ because
of the different effects they produce. Usually to admit 
that you are sick, renders your case less curable, while
to recognize your sin, aids in destroying it. Both sin and
sickness are error, and Truth is their remedy. The truth 
regarding error is, that error is not true, hence it is unreal.
To prove scientifically the error or unreality of sin, you
must first see the claim of sin, and then destroy it. 
Whereas, to prove scientifically the error or unreality of
disease, you must mentally unsee the disease; then you
will not feel it, and it is destroyed.     
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Rapidity of assimilation</FONT></P>
Systematic teaching and the student's spiritual growth
and experience in practice are requisite for a thorough
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_462"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 462</FONT></A></P><P><P>comprehension of Christian Science. Some individuals assimilate truth more readily than others, but any
student, who adheres to the divine rules
of Christian Science and imbibes the spirit
of Christ, can demonstrate Christian Science, cast out
error, heal the sick, and add continually to his store of
spiritual understanding, potency, enlightenment, and
success.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Divided loyalty</FONT></P>
If the student goes away to practise Truth's teachings only in part, dividing his interests between God and
mammon and substituting his own views for
Truth, he will inevitably reap the error he sows.
Whoever would demonstrate the healing of Christian
Science must abide strictly by its rules, heed every statement, and advance from the rudiments laid down. There
is nothing difficult nor toilsome in this task, when the way
is pointed out; but self-denial, sincerity, Christianity, and
persistence alone win the prize, as they usually do in every
department of life.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Anatomy defined</FONT></P>
Anatomy, when conceived of spiritually, is mental selfknowledge, and consists in the dissection of thoughts to
discover their quality, quantity,  and origin.
Are thoughts divine or human?  That is the
important question. This branch of study  is indispensable to the excision of error. The anatomy of Christian
Science teaches when and how to probe the self-inflicted wounds of selfishness, malice, envy, and hate. It
teaches the control of mad ambition. It unfolds the
hallowed influences of unselfishness, philanthropy, spiritual love. It urges the government of the body both
in health and in sickness. The Christian Scientist,
through understanding mental anatomy, discerns and
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_463"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 463</FONT></A></P><P><P>deals with the real cause of disease. The material physician gropes among phenomena, which fluctuate every instant under influences not embraced in his diagnosis, and 
so he may stumble and fall in the darkness.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Scientific obstetrics</FONT></P>
Teacher and student should also be familiar with the
obstetrics taught by this Science. To attend properly 
the birth of the new child, or divine idea, 
you should so detach mortal thought from its  
material conceptions, that the birth will be natural and 
safe. Though gathering new energy, this idea cannot
injure its useful surroundings in the travail of spiritual
birth. A spiritual idea has not a single element of error, 
and this truth removes properly whatever is offensive.
The new idea, conceived and born of Truth and Love, is
clad in white garments. Its beginning will be meek, its 
growth sturdy, and its maturity undecaying.  When
this new birth takes place, the Christian Science infant
is born of the Spirit, born of God, and can cause the 
mother no more suffering. By this we know that Truth
is here and has fulfilled its perfect work.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Unhesitating decision</FONT></P>
To decide quickly as to the proper treatment of error whether error is manifested in forms of sickness, sin,
or death - is the first step towards destroying error. Our Master treated error through  
Mind. He never enjoined obedience to the laws of nature,
if by these are meant laws of matter, nor did he use drugs.
There is a law of God applicable to healing, and it is a 
spiritual law instead of material. The sick are not healed
by inanimate matter or drugs, as they believe that they
are. Such seeming medical effect or action is that of socalled mortal mind.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Seclusion of the author</FONT></P>
It has been said to the author, "The world is bene<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_464"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 464</FONT></A></P><P><P>fited by you, but it feels your influence without seeing
you. Why do you not make yourself more widely
known?" Could her friends know how little
time the author has had, in which to make
herself outwardly known except through her laborious
publications, - and how much time and toil are still required to establish the stately operations of Christian
Science,--they would understand why she is so secluded.
Others could not take her place, even if willing so to do.
She therefore remains unseen at her post, seeking no selfaggrandizement but praying, watching, and working for
the redemption of mankind.
<P><P>If from an injury or from any cause, a Christian Scientist were seized with pain so violent that he could not
treat himself mentally,--and the Scientists had failed
to relieve him,--the sufferer could call a surgeon, who
would give him a hypodermic injection, then, when the
belief of pain was lulled, he could handle his own case
mentally. Thus it is that we "prove all things; [and]
hold fast that which is good."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The right motive and its reward</FONT></P>
In founding a pathological system of Christianity, the
author has labored to expound divine Principle, and not
to exalt personality. The weapons of bigotry,
ignorance, envy, fall before an honest heart.
Adulterating Christian Science, makes it void.
Falsity has no foundation. "The hireling fleeth, because
he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep." Neither
dishonesty nor ignorance ever founded, nor can they overthrow a scientific system of ethics.
