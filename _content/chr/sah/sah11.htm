<P><P><A NAME="pg_341"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 341</FONT></A></P><P><P>And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?--JESUS.
<P>But if the spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His spirit that dwelleth in you.--PAUL.
<P><P>THE strictures on this volume would condemn to
oblivion the truth, which is raising up thousands
from helplessness to strength and elevating them from
a theoretical to a practical Christianity. These criticisms
are generally based on detached sentences or clauses separated from their context. Even the Scriptures, which
grow in beauty and consistency from one grand root, appear contradictory when subjected to such usage. Jesus
said, "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see 
God" [Truth].
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Supported by facts</FONT></P>
In Christian Science mere opinion is valueless. Proof
is essential to a due estimate of this subject. Sneers at
the application of the word Science to Christianity cannot prevent that from being scientific which is based on divine Principle, demonstrated according to a divine given rule, and subjected to proof.
The facts are so absolute and numerous in support of
Christian Science, that misrepresentation and denuncia<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_342 "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 342 </FONT></A></P><P><P>tion cannot overthrow it. Paul alludes to "doubtful disputations." The hour has struck when proof and demonstration, instead of opinion and dogma, are summoned to
the support of Christianity, "making wise the simple."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Commands of Jesus</FONT></P>
In the result of some unqualified condemnations of
scientific Mind-healing, one may see with sorrow the sad
effects on the sick of denying Truth. He that
decries this Science does it presumptuously,
in the face of Bible history and in defiance of the direct
command of Jesus, "Go ye into all the world, and preach
the gospel," to which command was added the promise
that his students should cast out evils and heal the sick.
He bade the seventy disciples, as well as the twelve,
heal the sick in any town where they should be hospitably
received.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Christianity scientific</FONT></P>
If Christianity is not scientific, and Science is not of
God, then there is no invariable law, and truth becomes
an accident. Shall it be denied that a system
which works according to the Scriptures has
Scriptural authority?
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Argument of good works</FONT></P>
Christian Science awakens the sinner, reclaims the
infidel, and raises from the couch of pain the helpless
invalid. It speaks to the dumb the words of
Truth, and they answer with rejoicing. It
causes the deaf to hear, the lame to walk, and the blind
to see. Who would be the first to disown the Christliness of good works, when our Master says, "By their
fruits ye shall know them"?
<P><P>If Christian Scientists were teaching or practising
pharmacy or obstetrics according to the common theories, no denunciations would follow them, even if their
treatment resulted in the death of a patient. The people
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_343"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 343</FONT></A></P><P><P>are taught in such cases to say, Amen. Shall I then be 
smitten for healing and for teaching Truth as the Principle of healing, and for proving my word by my deed? 
James said: "Show me thy faith without thy works, and
I will show thee my faith by my works."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Personal experience</FONT></P>
Is not finite mind ignorant of God's method? This 
makes it doubly unfair to impugn and misrepresent the
facts, although, without this cross-bearing, 
one might not be able to say with the apostle, 
"None of these things move me." The sick, the halt,
and the blind look up to Christian Science with blessings,
and Truth will not be forever hidden by unjust parody 
from the quickened sense of the people.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Proof from miracles</FONT></P>
Jesus strips all disguise from error, when his teachings
are fully understood. By parable and argument he explains the impossibility of good producing evil; 
and he also scientifically demonstrates this great 
fact, proving by what are wrongly called miracles, that 
sin, sickness, and death are beliefs - illusive errors which he could and did destroy.
<P><P>It would sometimes seem as if truth were rejected because meekness and spirituality are the conditions of its
acceptance, while Christendom generally demands so
much less.           
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Example of the disciples</FONT></P>
Anciently those apostles who were Jesus' students,
as well as Paul who was not one of his students, healed
the sick and reformed the sinner by their 
religion. Hence the mistake which allows 
words, rather than works, to follow such examples!
Whoever is the first meekly and conscientiously to press 
along the line of gospel-healing, is often accounted a
heretic.
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_344 "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 344 </FONT></A></P><P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Strong position</FONT></P>
It is objected to Christian Science that it claims God
as the only absolute Life and Soul, and man to be His
idea,--that is, His image. It should be
added that this is claimed to represent the
normal, healthful, and sinless condition of man in divine
Science, and that this claim is made because the Scriptures say that God has created man in His own image
and after His likeness. Is it sacrilegious to assume that
God's likeness is not found in matter, sin, sickness, and
death?
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Efficacy may be attested</FONT></P>
Were it more fully understood that Truth heals and
that error causes disease, the opponents of a demonstrable
Science would perhaps mercifully withhold
their misrepresentations, which harm the sick;
and until the enemies of Christian Science test its efficacy
according to the rules which disclose its merits or demerits, it would be just to observe the Scriptural precept,
"Judge not."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The one divine method</FONT></P>
There are various methods of treating disease, which
are not included in the commonly accepted systems; but
there is only one which should be presented
to the whole world, and that is the Christian
Science which Jesus preached and practised and left to us
as his rich legacy.
<P><P>Why should one refuse to investigate this method
of treating disease? Why support the popular systems
of medicine, when the physician may perchance be an
infidel and may lose ninety-and-nine patients, while
Christian Science cures its hundred?  Is it because
allopathy and homoeopathy are more  fashionable and
less spiritual?
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Omnipotence set forth</FONT></P>
In the Bible the word Spirit is so commonly applied
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_345"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 345</FONT></A></P><P><P>to Deity, that Spirit and God are often regarded as synonymous terms; and it is thus they are uniformly used
and understood in Christian Science. As it 
is evident that the likeness of Spirit cannot be 
material, does it not follow that God cannot be in His
unlikeness and work through drugs to heal the sick? 
When the omnipotence of God is preached and His absoluteness is set forth, Christian sermons will heal the
sick.          
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Contradictions not found</FONT></P>
It is sometimes said, in criticising Christian Science,
that the mind which contradicts itself neither knows
itself nor what it is saying. It is indeed no
small matter to know one's self; but in this 
volume of mine there are no contradictory 
statements,--at least none which are apparent to those 
who understand its propositions well enough to pass
judgment upon them. One who understands Christian
Science can heal the sick on the divine Principle of Christian Science, and this practical proof is the only feasible
evidence that one does understand this Science.
<P><P>Anybody, who is able to perceive the incongruity between God's idea and poor humanity, ought to be able
to discern the distinction (made by Christian Science)
between God's man, made in His image, and the sinning 
race of Adam.
<P><P>The apostle says: "For if a man think himself to be
something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself." 
This thought of human, material nothingness, which
Science inculcates, enrages the carnal mind and is the
main cause of the carnal mind's antagonism. 
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>God's idea the ideal man    </FONT></P>
It is not the purpose of Christian Science to "educate
the idea of God, or treat it for disease," as is alleged
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_346 "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 346 </FONT></A></P><P><P>by one critic. I regret that such criticism confounds man
with Adam.  When man is spoken of as made in God's
image, it is not sinful and sickly mortal man
who is referred to, but the ideal man, reflecting
God's likeness.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Nothingness of error</FONT></P>
It is sometimes said that Christian Science teaches the
nothingness of sin, sickness, and death, and then teaches
how this nothingness is to be saved and healed.
The nothingness of nothing is plain; but we
need to understand that error is nothing, and that its
nothingness is not saved, but must be demonstrated in
order to prove the somethingness - yea, the allness of Truth. It is self-evident that we are harmonious only
as we cease to manifest evil or the belief that we suffer
from the sins of others. Disbelief in error destroys error,
and leads to the discernment of Truth. There are no
vacuums. How then can this demonstration be "fraught
with falsities painful to behold"?
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Truth antidotes error</FONT></P>
We treat error through the understanding of Truth,
because Truth is error's antidote. If a dream ceases, it
is self-destroyed, and the terror is over. When
a sufferer is convinced that there is no reality
in his belief of pain,--because matter has no sensation,
hence pain in matter is a false belief,--how can he suffer
longer? Do you feel the pain of tooth-pulling, when you
believe that nitrous-oxide gas has made you unconscious?
Yet, in your concept, the tooth, the operation, and the
forceps are unchanged.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Serving two masters</FONT></P>
Material beliefs must be expelled to make room for
spiritual understanding. We cannot serve both
God and mammon at the same time; but is
not this what frail mortals are trying to do? Paul says:
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_347"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 347</FONT></A></P><P><P>"The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against 
the flesh." Who is ready to admit this?
<P><P>It is said by one critic, that to verify this wonderful 
philosophy Christian Science declares that whatever is
mortal or discordant has no origin, existence, nor realness. Nothing really has Life but God, who is infinite 
Life; hence all is Life, and death has no dominion. This
writer infers that if anything needs to be doctored, it
must be the one God, or Mind. Had he stated his syllogism correctly, the conclusion would be that there is nothing left to be doctored.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Essential element of Christianity</FONT></P>
Critics should consider that the so-called mortal man
is not the reality of man. Then they would behold the
signs of Christ's coming. Christ, as the spiritual or true idea of God, comes now as of 
old, preaching the gospel to the poor, healing the sick, and casting out evils.  Is it error which
is restoring an essential element of Christianity, namely, apostolic, divine healing? No; it is the Science
of Christianity which is restoring it, and is the light
shining in darkness, which the darkness comprehends
not.
<P>If Christian Science takes away the popular gods, sin, sickness, and death, - it is Christ, Truth, who destroys these evils, and so proves their nothingness.
<P><P>The dream that matter and error are something
must yield to reason and revelation.  Then  mortals 
will behold the nothingness of sickness and sin, and
sin and sickness will disappear from consciousness.
The harmonious will appear real, and   the  inharmonious unreal. These critics will then see that error
is indeed the nothingness, which they chide us for
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_348 "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 348 </FONT></A></P><P><P>naming nothing and which we desire neither to honor
nor to fear.
<P><P>Medical theories virtually admit the nothingness of
hallucinations, even while treating them as disease; and
who objects to this? Ought we not, then, to approve
any cure, which is effected by making the disease appear
to be--what it really is--an illusion?
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>All disease a delusion</FONT></P>
Here is the difficulty: it is not generally understood how
one disease can be just as much a delusion as another. It
is a pity that the medical faculty and clergy
have not learned this, for Jesus established
this foundational fact, when devils, delusions, were cast
out and the dumb spake.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Elimination of sickness</FONT></P>
Are we irreverent towards sin, or imputing too much
power to God, when we ascribe to Him almighty Life
and Love? I deny His cooperation with evil,
because I desire to have no faith in evil or in
any power but God, good. Is it not well to eliminate from
so-called mortal mind that which, so long as it remains in
mortal mind, will show itself in forms of sin, sickness, and
death? Instead of tenaciously defending the supposed
rights of disease, while complaining of the suffering, disease brings, would it not be well to abandon the defence,
especially when by so doing our own condition can be improved and that of other persons as well?
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Full fruitage yet to come</FONT></P>
I have never supposed the world would immediately
witness the full fruitage of Christian Science, or that sin,
disease, and death would not be believed for
an indefinite time; but this I do aver, that,
as a result of teaching Christian Science, ethics and
temperance have received all impulse, health has been
restored, and longevity increased. If such are the pres<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_349"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 349</FONT></A></P><P><P>ent fruits, what will the harvest be, when this Science is
more generally understood?
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Law and gospel</FONT></P>
As Paul asked of the unfaithful in ancient days, so 
the rabbis of the present day ask concerning our healing and teaching, "Through breaking the law,
dishonorest thou God?" We have the gospel,  
however, and our Master annulled material law by healing contrary to it. We propose to follow the Master's
example. We should subordinate material law to spiritual law. Two essential points of Christian Science are,
that neither Life nor man dies, and that God is not the
author of sickness.   
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Language inadequate      </FONT></P>
The chief difficulty in conveying the teachings of divine
Science accurately to human thought lies in this, that like
all other languages, English is inadequate to
the expression of spiritual conceptions and 
propositions, because one is obliged to use material terms
in dealing with spiritual ideas. The elucidation of Christian Science lies in its spiritual sense, and this sense must
be gained by its disciples in order to grasp the meaning of
this Science. Out of this condition grew the prophecy
concerning the Christian apostles, "They shall speak with
new tongues."
<P><P>Speaking of the things of Spirit while dwelling on 
a material plane, material terms must be generally employed. Mortal thought does not at once catch the
higher meaning, and can do so only as thought is educated up to spiritual apprehension. To a certain extent
this is equally true of all learning, even that which is
wholly material.     
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Substance spiritual     </FONT></P>
In Christian Science, substance is understood to be
Spirit, while the opponents of Christian Science believe
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_350"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 350</FONT></A></P><P><P>substance to be matter. They think of matter as something and almost the only thing, and of the things which
pertain to Spirit as next to nothing, or as very
far removed from daily experience. Christian
Science takes exactly the opposite view.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Both words and works</FONT></P>
To understand all our Master's sayings as recorded
in the New Testament, sayings infinitely important,
his followers must grow into that stature of
manhood in Christ Jesus which enables them
to interpret his spiritual meaning. Then they know
how Truth casts out error and heals the sick. His
words were the offspring of his deeds, both of which
must be understood.  Unless the works are comprehended which his words explained, the words are
blind.
<P><P>The Master often refused to explain his words, because
it was difficult in a material age to apprehend spiritual
Truth. He said: "This people's heart is waxed gross,
and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they
have closed; lest at any time they should see with their
eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand
with their heart, and should be converted, and I should
heal them."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The divine life-link</FONT></P>
"The Word was made flesh." Divine Truth must be
known by its effects on the body as well as on the mind,
before the Science of being can be demonstrated. Hence its embodiment in the incarnate Jesus,--that life-link forming the connection through
which the real reaches the unreal, Soul rebukes sense, and
Truth destroys error.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Truth a present help</FONT></P>
In Jewish worship the Word was materially explained,
and the spiritual sense was scarcely perceived. The
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_351"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 351</FONT></A></P><P><P>religion which sprang from half-hidden Israelitish history
was pedantic and void of healing power. When we lose
faith in God's power to heal, we distrust the
divine Principle which demonstrates Christian  
Science, and then we cannot heal the sick. Neither can
we heal through the help of Spirit, if we plant ourselves
on a material basis.
<P><P>The author became a member of the orthodox Congregational Church in early years. Later she learned 
that her own prayers failed to heal her as did the prayers
of her devout parents and the church; but when the
spiritual sense of the creed was discerned in the Science 
of Christianity, this spiritual sense was a present help. It
was the living, palpitating presence of Christ, Truth, which
healed the sick.      
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Fatal premises    </FONT></P>
We cannot bring out the practical proof of Christianity,
which Jesus required, while error seems as potent and
real to us as Truth, and while we make a personal devil and an anthropomorphic God our  
starting-points,--especially if we consider Satan as a
being coequal in power with Deity, if not superior to Him. 
Because such starting-points are neither spiritual nor
scientific, they cannot work out the Spirit-rule of Christian
healing, which proves the nothingness of error, discord, 
by demonstrating the all-inclusiveness of harmonious
Truth.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Fruitless worship</FONT></P>
The Israelites centred their thoughts on the material 
in their attempted worship of the spiritual. To them
matter was substance, and Spirit was shadow. 
They thought to worship Spirit from a material standpoint, but this was impossible. They might
appeal to Jehovah, but their prayer brought down no
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_352 "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 352 </FONT></A></P><P><P>proof that it was heard, because they did not sufficiently
understand God to be able to demonstrate His power
to heal,--to make harmony the reality and discord the
unreality.
<P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Spirit the tangible</FONT></P>
Our Master declared that his material body was not
spirit, evidently considering it a mortal and material belief of flesh and bones, whereas the Jews took
a diametrically opposite view. To Jesus, not
materiality, but spirituality, was the reality of man's existence, while to the rabbis the spiritual was the intangible and uncertain, if not the unreal.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Ghosts not realities</FONT></P>
Would a mother say to her child, who is frightened at
imaginary ghosts and sick in consequence of the fear:
"I know that ghosts are real. They exist,
and are to be feared; but you must not be
afraid of them"?
<P><P>Children, like adults, ought to fear a reality which
can harm them and which they do not understand, for
at any moment they may become its helpless victims;
but instead of increasing children's fears by declaring
ghosts to be real, merciless, and powerful, thus watering the very roots of childish timidity, children should
be assured that their fears are groundless, that ghosts
are not realities, but traditional beliefs, erroneous and
man-made.
<P><P>In short, children should be told not to believe in ghosts,
because there are no such things. If belief in their reality
is destroyed, terror of ghosts will depart and health be restored. The objects of alarm will then vanish into nothingness, no longer seeming worthy of fear or honor. To
accomplish a good result, it is certainly not irrational to
tell the truth about ghosts.
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_353"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 353</FONT></A></P><P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The real and the unreal</FONT></P>
The Christianly scientific real is the sensuous unreal. 
Sin, disease, whatever seems real to material sense, is unreal in divine Science. The physical senses 
and Science have ever been antagonistic, and
they will so continue, till the testimony of the physical
senses yields entirely to Christian Science.  
  
How can a Christian, having the stronger evidence of
Truth which contradicts the evidence of error, think of
the latter as real or true, either in the form of sickness or 
of sin? All must admit that Christ is "the way, the
truth, and the life," and that omnipotent Truth certainly
does destroy error.         
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Superstition obsolete </FONT></P>
The age has not wholly outlived the sense of ghostly
beliefs. It still holds them more or less. Time has not
yet reached eternity, immortality, complete 
reality. All the real is eternal. Perfection 
underlies reality. Without perfection, nothing is wholly
real. All things will continue to disappear, until per-  
fection appears and reality is reached. We must give up
the spectral at all points. We must not continue to admit
the somethingness of superstition, but we must yield up 
all belief in it and be wise. When we learn that error
is not real, we shall be ready for progress, "forgetting
those things which are behind."       
<P><P>The grave does not banish the ghost of materiality.
So long as there are supposed limits to Mind, and those
limits are human, so long will ghosts seem to continue. 
Mind is limitless. It never was material. The true idea
of being is spiritual and immortal, and from this it follows
that whatever is laid off is the ghost, some unreal belief. 
Mortal beliefs can neither demonstrate Christianity nor
apprehend the reality of Life.
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_354"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 354</FONT></A></P><P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Christian warfare</FONT></P>
Are the protests of Christian Science against the notion
that there can be material life, substance, or mind "utter
falsities and absurdities," as some aver? Why
then do Christians try to obey the Scriptures
and war against "the world, the flesh, and the devil"?
Why do they invoke the divine aid to enable them to leave
all for Christ, Truth? Why do they use this phraseology,
and yet deny Christian Science, when it teaches precisely
this thought? The words of divine Science find their
immortality in deeds, for their Principle heals the sick
and spiritualizes humanity.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Healing omitted</FONT></P>
On the other hand, the Christian opponents of Christian Science neither give nor offer any proofs that their
Master's religion can heal the sick. Surely
it is not enough to cleave to barren and desultory dogmas, derived from the traditions of the elders who
thereunto have set their seals.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Scientific consistency</FONT></P>
Consistency is seen in example more than in precept.
Inconsistency is shown by words without deeds, which
are like clouds without rain.  If our words
fail to express our deeds, God will redeem that
weakness, and out of the mouth of babes He will perfect
praise. The night of materiality is far spent, and with
the dawn Truth will waken men spiritually to hear and
to speak the new tongue.
<P><P>Sin should become unreal to every one. It is in itself
inconsistent, a divided kingdom. Its supposed realism
has no divine authority, and I rejoice in the apprehension
of this grand verity.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Spiritual meaning</FONT></P>
The opponents of divine Science must be
charitable, if they would be Christian.  If the
letter of Christian Science appears inconsistent, they should
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_355"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 355</FONT></A></P><P><P>gain the spiritual meaning of Christian Science, and then 
the ambiguity will vanish.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Practical arguments</FONT></P>
The charge of inconsistency in Christianly scientific 
methods of dealing with sin and disease is met by something practical,--namely, the proof of the   
utility of these methods; and proofs are better 
than mere verbal arguments or prayers which evince no
spiritual power to heal.
<P><P>As for sin and disease, Christian Science says, in the 
language of the Master, "Follow me; and let the dead
bury their dead." Let discord of every name and nature
be heard no more, and let the harmonious and true sense 
of Life and being take possession of human consciousness.
<P><P>What is the relative value of the two conflicting theories regarding Christian healing? One, according to 
the commands of our Master, heals the sick. The other,
popular religion, declines to admit that Christ's religion
has exercised any systematic healing power since the first 
century.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Conditions of criticism</FONT></P>
The statement that the teachings of Christian Science in this work are "absolutely false, and the most 
egregious fallacies ever offered for acceptance," is an opinion wholly due to a misapprehension both of the divine Principle and practice of 
Christian Science and to a consequent inability to demonstrate this Science. Without this understanding, no one
is capable of impartial or correct criticism, because demonstration and spiritual understanding are God's immortal
keynotes, proved to be such by our Master and evidenced
by the sick who are cured and by the sinners who are 
reformed.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Weakness of material theories</FONT></P>
Strangely enough, we ask for material theories in sup<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_356 "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 356 </FONT></A></P><P><P>port of spiritual and eternal truths, when the two are so
antagonistic that the material thought must become spiritualized before the spiritual fact is attained.
So-called material existence affords no evidence
theories of spiritual existence and immortality. Sin,
sickness, and death do not prove man's entity or immortality. Discord can never establish the facts of harmony.
Matter is not the vestibule of Spirit.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Irreconciliable differences</FONT></P>
Jesus reasoned on this subject practically, and controlled sickness, sin, and death on the basis of his spirituality. Understanding the nothingness of
material things, he spoke of flesh and Spirit
as the two opposites, - as error and Truth, not contributing in any way to each other's happiness and existence.
Jesus knew, "It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh
profiteth nothing."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Copartnership impossible</FONT></P>
There is neither a present nor an eternal copartnership between error and Truth, between flesh and Spirit.
God is as incapable of producing sin, sickness, and death as He is of experiencing these
errors. How then is it possible for Him to create man
subject to this triad of errors,--man who is made in the
divine likeness?
<P><P>Does God create a material man out of Himself, Spirit?
Does evil proceed from good? Does divine Love commit a fraud on humanity by making man inclined to sin,
and then punishing him for it? Would any one call it
wise and good to create the primitive, and then punish its
derivative?
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Two infinite creators absurd</FONT></P>
Does subsequent follow its antecedent?  It does.
Was there original self-creative sin? Then there must
have been more than one creator, more than one God.
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_357"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 357</FONT></A></P><P><P>In common justice, we must admit that God will not 
punish man for doing what He created man
capable of doing, and knew from the outset 
that man would do. God is "of purer eyes 
than to behold evil." We sustain Truth, not by accepting, but by rejecting a lie.    
   
Jesus said of personified evil, that it was "a liar, and
the father of it." Truth creates neither a lie, a capacity
to lie, nor a liar. If mankind would relinquish the belief 
that God makes sickness, sin, and death, or makes man
capable of suffering on account of this malevolent triad,
the foundations of error would be sapped and error's destruction ensured; but if we theoretically endow mortals
with the creativeness and authority of Deity, how dare we
attempt to destroy what He hath made, or even to deny
that God made man evil and made evil good?
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Anthropomorphism</FONT></P>
History teaches that the popular and false notions
about the Divine Being and character have originated
in the human mind. As there is in reality but 
one God, one Mind, wrong notions about God
must have originated in a false supposition, not in immortal Truth, and they are fading out. They are false
claims, which will eventually disappear, according to the
vision of St. John in the Apocalypse.  
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>One supremacy  </FONT></P>
If what opposes God is real, there must be two
powers, and God is not supreme and infinite. Can
Deity be almighty, if another mighty and 
self-creative cause exists and sways mankind? Has the Father "Life in Himself," as the Scriptures say, and, if so, can Life, or God, dwell in evil and 
create it? Can matter drive Life, Spirit, hence, and so
defeat omnipotence?
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_358 "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 358 </FONT></A></P><P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Matter impotent</FONT></P>
Is the woodman's axe, which destroys a tree's so-called
life, superior to omnipotence? Can a leaden bullet deprive a man of Life,--that is, of God, who is
man's Life? If God is at the mercy of matter,
then matter is omnipotent. Such doctrines are "confusion worse confounded." If two statements directly contradict each other and one is true, the other must be false.
Is Science thus contradictory?
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Scientific and Biblical facts</FONT></P>
Christian Science, understood, coincides with the
Scriptures, and sustains logically and demonstratively
every point it presents. Otherwise it would
not be Science, and could not present its
proofs. Christian Science is neither made up of contradictory aphorisms nor of the inventions of those who scoff
at God. It presents the calm and clear verdict of Truth
against error, uttered and illustrated by the prophets,
by Jesus, by his apostles, as is recorded throughout the
Scriptures.
<P><P>Why are the words of Jesus more frequently cited
for our instruction than are his remarkable works? Is
it not because there are few who have gained a true
knowledge of the great import to Christianity of those
works?
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Personal confidence</FONT></P>
Sometimes it is said; "Rest assured that whatever
effect Christian Scientists may have on the sick, comes
through rousing within the sick a belief
that in the removal of disease these healers
have wonderful power, derived from the Holy Ghost."
Is it likely that church-members have more faith in
some Christian Scientist, whom they have perhaps
never seen and against whom they have been warned,
than they have in their own accredited and  orthodox
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_359"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 359</FONT></A></P><P><P>pastors, whom they have seen and have been taught 
to love and to trust?
<P><P>Let any clergyman try to cure his friends by their 
faith in him. Will that faith heal them? Yet Scientists will take the same cases, and cures will follow.
Is this because the patients have more faith in the Scientist than in their pastor? I have healed infidels whose
only objection to this method was, that I as a Christian Scientist believed in the Holy Spirit, while they, the 
patients, did not.
<P><P>Even though you aver that the material senses are
indispensable to man's existence or entity, you must 
change the human concept of life, and must at length
know yourself spiritually and scientifically. The evidence of the existence of Spirit, Soul, is palpable only to 
spiritual sense, and is not apparent to the material senses,
which cognize only that which is the opposite of Spirit.
<P><P>True Christianity is to be honored wherever found,
but when shall we arrive at the goal which that word
implies? From Puritan parents, the discoverer of Christian Science early received her
religious education. In childhood, she often listened
with joy to these words, falling from the lips of her
saintly mother, "God is able to raise you up from sickness;" and she pondered the meaning of that Scripture
she so often quotes: "And these signs shall follow them
that believe; . . . they shall lay hands on the sick, 
and they shall recover."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Two different artists</FONT></P>
A Christian Scientist and an opponent are like two
artists. One says: "I have spiritual ideals, 
indestructible and glorious. When others see
them as I do, in their true light and loveliness,--and
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_360"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 360</FONT></A></P><P><P>know that these ideals are real and eternal because drawn
from Truth,--they will find that nothing is lost, and all
is won, by a right estimate of what is real."
<P><P>The other artist replies: "You wrong my experience.
I have no mind-ideals except those which are both mental
and material. It is true that materiality renders these
ideals imperfect and destructible; yet I would not exchange mine for thine, for mine give me such personal
pleasure, and they are not so shockingly transcendental.
They require less self-abnegation, and keep Soul well out
of sight. Moreover, I have no notion of losing my old
doctrines or human opinions."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Choose ye to-day</FONT></P>
Dear reader, which mind-picture or externalized thought
shall be real to you,--the material or the spiritual?
Both you cannot have.  You are bringing out
your own ideal.  This ideal is either temporal
or eternal. Either Spirit or matter is your model. If you
try to have two models, then you practically have none.
Like a pendulum in a clock, you will be thrown back and
forth, striking the ribs of matter and swinging between the
real and the unreal.
<P><P>Hear the wisdom of Job, as given in the excellent translation of the late Rev. George R. Noyes, D.D.: <P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall mortal man be more just than God?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall man be more pure than his Maker?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, He putteth no trust in His ministering spirits,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And His angels He chargeth with frailty.<BR>
<P><P>Of old, the Jews put to death the Galilean Prophet,
the best Christian on earth, for the truth he spoke and
demonstrated, while to-day, Jew and Christian can unite
in doctrine and denomination on the very basis of Jesus'
words and works. The Jew believes that the Messiah or
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_361"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 361</FONT></A></P><P><P>Christ has not yet come; the Christian believes that
Christ is God. Here Christian Science intervenes, explains these doctrinal points, cancels the disagreement, 
and settles the question. Christ, as the true spiritual idea,
is the ideal of God now and forever, here and everywhere.
The Jew who believes in the First Commandment is a 
monotheist; he has one omnipresent God. Thus the Jew
unites with the Christian's doctrine that God is come and
is present now and forever. The Christian who believes
in the First Commandment is a monotheist. This he
virtually unites with the Jew's belief in one God, and
recognizes that Jesus Christ is not God, as Jesus himself 
declared, but is the Son of God. This declaration of
Jesus, understood, conflicts not at all with another of his
sayings: "I and my Father are one,"--that is, one in 
quality, not in quantity. As a drop of water is one with
the ocean, a ray of light one with the, sun, even so God
and man, Father and son, are one in being. The Scripture reads: "For in Him we live, and move, and have
our being."
<P><P>I have revised Science and Health only to give a 
clearer and fuller expression of its original meaning. Spiritual ideas unfold as we advance. A human perception of
divine Science, however limited, must be correct in order 
to be Science and subject to demonstration. A germ of infinite Truth, though least in the kingdom of heaven is the
higher hope on earth, but it will be rejected and reviled 
until God prepares the soil for the seed. That which
when sown bears immortal fruit, enriches mankind only
when it is understood,--hence the many readings given 
the Scriptures, and the requisite revisions of Science and
Health with Key to the Scriptures.
