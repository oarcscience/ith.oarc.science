1. Lord's Day</h4>
<b>Question 1.</b><p>
<b></b>What is thy only comfort in life and death?<p>
<b>Answer.</b><p>
<b></b>That I with body and soul, both in life and death, (a) <p>
am not my own, (b) <p>
but belong unto my faithful Saviour Jesus Christ; (c) <p>
who, with his precious blood, has fully satisfied for all my sins, (d) <p>
and delivered me from all the power of the devil; (e) <p>
and so preserves me (f) <p>
that without the will of my heavenly Father, not a hair can fall from my head;
(g)<p>
yea, that all things must be subservient to my salvation, (h) <p>
and therefore, by his Holy Spirit,  He also assures me of eternal life, (i) <p>
and makes me sincerely willing and ready, henceforth, to live unto him. (j)<p>

<h4 align=center>
2. Lord's Day</h4>
<b>Q. 3.</b><p>
<b></b>Whence knowest thou thy misery?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Out of the law of God. (a)<p>
<p>
(a) Rom.3:20.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 4.</b><p>
<b></b>What does the law of God require of us?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Christ teaches us that briefly, Matt. 22:37-40, "Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and
with all thy strength.  This is the first and the great commandment; and the
second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  On these two
commandments hang all the law and the prophets." (a)<p>
<p>
(a) Deut.6:5; Lev.19:18; Mark 12:30; Luke 10:27.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 5.</b><p>
<b></b>Canst thou keep all these things perfectly?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>In no wise; (a)<p>
for I am prone by nature to hate God and my neighbour.(b)<p>
<p>
(a) Rom.3:10,20,23; 1 John 1:8,10. (b) Rom.8:7; Eph.2:3; Tit.3:3;<p>
Gen.6:5; Gen.8:21; Jer.17:9; Rom.7:23.<p>

<h4 align=center>
3. Lord's Day</h4>
<b>Q. 6.</b><p>
<b></b>Did God then create man so wicked and perverse?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>By no means;<p>
but God created man good, (a)<p>
and after his own image, (b)<p>
in true righteousness and holiness, that he might rightly know God his Creator,
heartily love him and live with him in eternal happiness to glorify and praise
him. (c)<p>
<p>
(a) Gen.1:31. (b) Gen.1:26,27. (c) Col.3:9,10; Eph.4:23,24; 2<p>
Cor.3:18.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 7.</b><p>
<b></b>Whence then proceeds this depravity of human nature?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>From the fall and disobedience of our first parents,<p>
Adam and Eve, in Paradise; (a)<p>
hence our nature is become so corrupt,  that we are all conceived and born in
sin. (b)<p>
<p>
(a) Gen.3; Rom.5:12,18,19. (b) Ps.51:5; Gen.5:3.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 8.</b><p>
<b></b>Are we then so corrupt that we are wholly incapable of doing any good,
and inclined to all wickedness?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Indeed we are; (a)<p>
except we are regenerated by the Spirit of God. (b)<p>
<p>
(a) Gen.8:21; John 3:6; Gen.6:5; Job 14:4; Job 15:14,16,36; Isa.53:6.<p>
(b) John 3:3,5; 1 Cor.12:3; 2 Cor.3:5.<p>

<h4 align=center>
4. Lord's Day</h4>
<b>Q. 9.</b><p>
<b></b>Does not God then do injustice to man, by requiring from him in his law,
that which he cannot perform?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Not at all; (a)<p>
for God made man capable of performing it;<p>
but man, by the instigation of the devil, (b)<p>
and his own wilful disobedience, (c)<p>
deprived himself and all his posterity of those divine gifts.<p>
<p>
(a) Eph.4:24; Eccl.7:29. (b) John 8:44; 2 Cor.11:3; Gen.3:4. (c)<p>
Gen.3:6; Rom.5:12; Gen.3:13; 1 Tim.2:13,14.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 10.</b><p>
<b></b>Will God suffer such disobedience and rebellion to go unpunished?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>By no means;<p>
but is terribly displeased (a)<p>
with our original as well as actual sins; and will punish them in his just
judgment temporally and eternally, (b)<p>
as he has declared, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things,
which are written in the book of the law, to do them." (c)<p>
<p>
(a) Gen.2:17; Rom.5:12. (b) Ps.5:5; Ps.50:21; Nah.1:2; Exod.20:5;<p>
Exod.34:7; Rom.1:18; Eph.5:6; Heb.9:27. (c) Deut.27:26; Gal.3:10.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 11.</b><p>
<b></b>Is not God then also merciful?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>God is indeed merciful, (a)<p>
but also just; (b)<p>
therefore his justice requires, that sin which is committed against the most
high majesty of God, be also punished with extreme, that is, with everlasting
punishment of body and soul.<p>
<p>
(a) Exod.34:6,7; Exod.20:6. (b) Ps.7:9; Exod.20:5; Exod.23:7;<p>
Exod.34:7; Ps.5:5,6; Nah.1:2,3.<p>

<h4 align=center>
5. Lord's Day</h4>
<b>Q. 12.</b><p>
<b></b>Since then, by the righteous judgment of God, we deserve temporal and
eternal punishment, is there no way by which we may escape that punishment, and
be again received into favour?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>God will have his justice satisfied: (a)<p>
and therefore we must make this full satisfaction, either by ourselves, or by
another. (b)<p>
<p>
(a) Gen.2:17; Exod.20:5; Exod.23:7; Ezek.18:4; Matt.5:26; 2 Thess.1:6;<p>
Luke 16:2. (b) Rom.8:3,4.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 13.</b><p>
<b></b>Can we ourselves then make this satisfaction?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>By no means;<p>
but on the contrary we daily increase our debt. (a)<p>
<p>
(a). Job 9:2,3; Job 15:15,16; Job 4:18,19; Ps.130:3; Matt.6:12;<p>
Matt.18:25; Matt.16:26.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 14.</b><p>
<b></b>Can there be found anywhere, one, who is a mere creature, able to
satisfy for us?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>None; for, first, God will not punish any other creature for the sin
which man has committed; (a)<p>
and further, no mere creature can sustain the burden of God's eternal wrath
against sin, so as to deliver others from it. (b)<p>
<p>
(a) Ezek.18:4; Gen.3:17; Heb.2:14-17. (b) Nah.1:6; Ps.130:3.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 15.</b><p>
<b></b>What sort of a mediator and deliverer then must we seek for?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>For one who is very man, and perfectly (a)<p>
righteous; (b)<p>
and yet more powerful than all creatures; that is, one who is also very God.
(c)<p>
<p>
(a) 1 Cor.15:21; Jer.33:16; Isa.53:9; 2 Cor.5:21. (b) Heb.7:16,26. (c)<p>

<h4 align=center>
6. Lord's day</h4>
<b>Q. 16. </b><p>
<b></b>Why must he be very man, and also perfectly righteous?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Because the justice of God requires that the same human nature<p>
which has sinned, should likewise make satisfaction for sin; (a)<p>
and one, who is himself a sinner, cannot satisfy for others. (b)<p>
<p>
(a) Ezek.18:4,20; Rom.5:12,15,18; 1 Cor.15:21; Heb.2:14-16; 1<p>
Pet.3:18; Isa.53:3-5,10,11. (b) Heb.7:26,27; Ps.49:7,8; 1 Pet.3:18.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 17.</b><p>
<b></b>Why must he in one person be also very God?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>That he might,<p>
by the power of his Godhead (a)<p>
sustain in his human nature, (b)<p>
the burden of God's wrath; (c)<p>
and might obtain for, and restore to us, righteousness and life. (d)<p>
<p>
(a) Isa.9:6; Isa.63:3. (b) Isa.53:4,11. (c) Deut.4:24; Nah.1:6;<p>
Ps.130:3. (d) Isa.53:5,11; Acts 2:24; 1 Pet.3:18; John 3:16; Acts<p>
20:28; John 1:4.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 18.</b><p>
<b></b>Who then is that Mediator, who is in one person both very God, (a)<p>
and a real (b)<p>
righteous man? (c)<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Our Lord Jesus Christ: (d)<p>
"who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and
redemption." (e)<p>
<p>

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 19.</b><p>
<b></b>Whence knowest thou this?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>From the holy gospel, which God himself first revealed in Paradise;
(a)<p>
and afterwards published by the patriarchs (b)<p>
and prophets, (c)<p>
and represented by the sacrifices and other ceremonies of the law; (d)<p>
and lastly, has fulfilled it by his only begotten Son. (e)<p>
<p>
(a) Gen.3:15. (b) Gen.22:18; Gen.12:3; Gen.49:10,11. (c) Isa.53;<p>

<h4 align=center>
7. Lord's Day</h4>
<b>Q. 20.</b><p>
<b></b>Are all men then, as they perished in Adam, saved by Christ?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>No; (a)<p>
only those who are ingrafted into him, and, receive all his benefits, by a true
faith. (b)<p>

Heb.10:39; Heb.11:6.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 21.</b><p>
<b></b>What is true faith?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>True faith is not only a certain knowledge, whereby I hold for truth all
that God has revealed to us in his word, (a)<p>
but also an assured confidence, (b)<p>
which the Holy Ghost (c)<p>
works by the gospel in my heart; (d)<p>
that not only to others, but to me also, remission of sin, everlasting
righteousness and salvation, (e)<p>
are freely given by God, merely of grace, only for the sake of Christ's merits.

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 22.</b><p>
<b></b>What is then necessary for a christian to believe?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>All things promised us in the gospel, (a)<p>
which the articles of our catholic undoubted christian faith briefly teach us.
<p>
(a) John 20:31; Matt.28:19; Mark 1:15.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 23.</b><p>
<b></b>What are these articles?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>1.  I believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:<p>
2.  And in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord:<p>
3.  Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary:<p>
4.  Suffered under Pontius Pilate; was crucified, dead, and buried: He
descended into hell:<p>
5.  The third day he rose again from the dead:<p>
6.  He ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father
Almighty:<p>
7.  From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead:<p>
8.  I believe in the Holy Ghost:<p>
9.  I believe a holy catholic church: the communion of saints:<p>
10. The forgiveness of sins:<p>

8. Lord's Day</h4>
<b>Q. 24.</b><p>
<b></b>How are these articles divided?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Into three parts;<p>
the first is of God the Father, and our creation;<p>
the second of God the Son, and our redemption;<p>
the third of God the Holy Ghost, and our sanctification.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 25.</b><p>
<b></b>Since there is but one only divine essence, (a)<p>
why speakest thou of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Because God has so revealed himself in his word, (b)<p>
that these three distinct persons are the one only true and eternal God.<p>

9. Lord's Day</h4>
<b>Q. 26.</b><p>
<b></b>What believest thou when thou sayest, "I believe in God the Father,
Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth"?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>That the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (who of nothing made
heaven and earth, with all that is in them; (a)<p>
who likewise upholds and governs the same by his eternal counsel and
providence) (b)<p>
is for the sake of Christ his Son, my God and my Father; (c)<p>
on whom I rely so entirely, that I have no doubt, but he will provide me with
all things necessary for soul and body (d)<p>
and further, that he will make whatever evils he sends upon me, in this valley
of tears turn out to my advantage; (e)<p>
for he is able to do it, being Almighty God, (f)<p>
and willing, being a faithful Father. (g)<p>

<h4 align=center>
10. Lord's Day</h4>
<b>Q. 27.</b><p>
<b></b>What dost thou mean by the providence of God?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>The almighty and everywhere present power of God; (a)<p>
whereby, as it were by his hand, he upholds and governs (b)<p>
heaven, earth, and all creatures; so that herbs and grass, rain and drought,
(c)<p>
fruitful and barren years, meat and drink, health and sickness, (d)<p>
riches and poverty, (e)<p>
yea, and all things come, not by chance, but be his fatherly hand. (f)<p>

<b>Q. 28.</b><p>
<b></b>What advantage is it to us to know that God has created, and by his
providence does still uphold all things?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>That we may be patient in adversity; (a)<p>
thankful in  prosperity; (b)<p>
and that in all things, which may hereafter befall us, we place our firm trust
in our faithful God and Father, (c)<p>
that nothing shall separate us from his love; (d)<p>
since all creatures are so in his hand, that without his will they cannot so
much as move. (e)<p>

<h4 align=center>
11. Lord's Day</h4>
<b>Q. 29.</b><p>
<b></b>Why is the Son of God called "Jesus", that is a Saviour?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Because he saveth us,<p>
and delivereth us from our sins; (a)<p>
and likewise, because we ought not to seek, neither can find salvation in any
other. (b)<p>
<p>
(a) Matt.1:21; Heb.7:24,25. (b) Acts 4:12; John 15:4,5; 1 Tim.2:5;<p>

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 30.</b><p>
<b></b>Do such then believe in Jesus the only Saviour, who seek their salvation
and welfare of saints, of themselves, or anywhere else?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>They do not;<p>
for though they boast of him in words, yet in deeds they deny Jesus the only
deliverer and Saviour; (a)<p>
for one of these two things must be true, that either Jesus is not a complete
Saviour; or that they, who by a true faith receive this Saviour, must find all
things in him necessary to their salvation. (b)<p>

then these two natures in Christ separated from one another?<p>

it must necessarily follow that the same is beyond the limits of the human

it. <p>

this end, that by the use thereof, he may the more fully declare and seal to us
the promise of the gospel, viz., that he grants us freely the remission of sin,
and life eternal, for the sake of that one sacrifice of Christ, accomplished on
the cross. (a)<p>

<b></b>Are both word and sacraments, then, ordained and appointed for this end,
that they may direct our faith to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross,
as the only ground of our salvation? (a)<p>
<b>A.</b><p>

us by the sacraments, that the whole of our salvation depends upon that one
sacrifice of Christ which he offered for us on the cross.<p>

<p>
<b>Q. 69.</b><p>
<b></b>How art thou admonished and assured by holy baptism, that the one
sacrifice of Christ upon the cross is of real advantage to thee?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Thus: That Christ appointed this external washing with water, (a)<p>
adding thereto this promise, (b)<p>
that I am as certainly washed by his blood and Spirit from all the pollution of
my soul, that is, from all my sins, (c)<p>
as I am washed externally with water, by which the filthiness of the body is
commonly washed away.<p>

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 70.</b><p>
<b></b>What is it to be washed with the blood and Spirit of Christ?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>It is to receive of God the remission of sins, freely, for the sake of
Christ's blood, which he shed for us by his sacrifice upon the cross; (a)<p>
and also to be renewed by the Holy Ghost, and sanctified to be members of
Christ, that so we may more and more die unto sin, and lead holy and unblamable
lives. (b)<p>

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 71.</b><p>
<b></b>Where has Christ promised us, that he will as certainly wash us by his
blood and Spirit, as we are washed with the water of baptism?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>In the institution of baptism, which is thus expressed:  "Go ye,
therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost", Matt.28:19.<p>
And "he that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth
not, shall be damned.", Mark 16:16.<p>
This promise is also repeated, where the scripture calls baptism "the washing
of regenerations" and the washing away of sins. Tit.3:5,<p>

<p>
<b>Q. 72.</b><p>
<b></b>Is then the external baptism with water the washing away of sin
itself?<p>

for the blood of Jesus Christ only, and the Holy Ghost cleanse us from all sin.

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 73.</b><p>
<b></b>Why then does the Holy Ghost call baptism "the washing of regeneration,"
and "the washing away of sins"?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>God speaks thus not without great cause, to-wit, not only thereby to
teach us, that as the filth of the body is purged away by water, so our sins
are removed by the blood and Spirit of Jesus Christ; (a)<p>
but especially that by this divine pledge and sign he may assure us, that we
are spiritually cleansed from our sins as really, as we are externally washed
with water. (b)<p>

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 74.</b><p>
<b></b>Are infants also to be baptized?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Yes:<p>
for since they, as well as the adult, are included in the covenant and church
of God; (a)<p>
and since redemption from sin (b)<p>
by the blood of Christ, and the Holy Ghost, the author of faith, is promised to
them no less than to the adult; (c)<p>
they must therefore by baptism, as a sign of the covenant, be also admitted
into the christian church; and be distinguished from the children of
unbelievers (d)<p>
as was done in the old covenant or testament by circumcision, (e)<p>
instead of which baptism is instituted (f)<p>
in the new covenant.<p>

28 Lord's Day</h4>
<p>
<b>Q. 75.</b><p>
<b></b>How art thou admonished and assured in the Lord's Supper, that thou art
a partaker of that one sacrifice of Christ, accomplished on the cross, and of
all his benefits?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Thus: That Christ has commanded me and all believers, to eat of this
broken bread, and to drink of this cup, in remembrance of him, adding these
promises: (a)<p>
first, that his body was offered and broken on the cross for me, and his blood
shed for me, as certainly as I see with my eyes, the bread of the Lord broken
for me, and the cup communicated to me; and further, that he feeds and
nourishes my soul to everlasting life, with his crucified body and shed blood,
as assuredly as I receive from the hands of the minister, and taste with my
mouth the bread and cup of the Lord, as certain signs of the body and blood of
Christ.<p>

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 76.</b><p>
<b></b>What is it then to eat the crucified body, and drink the shed blood of
Christ?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>It is not only to embrace with believing heart all the sufferings and
death of Christ and thereby to obtain the pardon of sin, and life eternal;
(a)<p>
but also, besides that, to become more and more united to his sacred body,
(b)<p>
by the Holy Ghost, who dwells both in Christ and in us; so that we, though
Christ is in heaven (c)<p>
and we on earth, are notwithstanding "flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone"
(d)<p>
and that we live, and are governed forever by one spirit, (e)<p>
as members of the same body are by one soul.<p>

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 77.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where has Christ promised that he will as
certainly feed and nourish believers with his body and bleed, as they eat of
this broken bread, and drink of this cup?<br>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>In the institution of the supper, which is thus expressed: (a)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord Jesus, the same night in which he
was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and: said:
eat, this is my body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me.
After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying:  this
cup is the new testament in my blood; this do ye, as often as ye drink it, in
remembrance of me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, as often as ye eat this bread, and drink
this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he come."  1 Cor.11:23-26.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This promise is repeated by the holy apostle
Paul, where he says "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the
communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which we break, is it not the
communion of the body of Christ?  For we being many are one bread, and one
body:  for we are all partakers of that one bread."  1 Cor.10:16,17.<br>

29 Lord's Day</h4>
<p>
<b>Q. 78.</b><p>
<b></b>Do then the bread and wine become the very body and blood of Christ?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Not at all: (a)<p>
but as the water in baptism is not changed into the blood of Christ, neither is
the washing away of sin itself, being only the sign and confirmation thereof
appointed of God; (b)<p>
so the bread in the Lord's supper is not changed into the very body of Christ;
(c)<p>
though agreeably to the nature and properties of sacraments, (d)<p>
it is called the body of Christ Jesus.<p>
<p>
(a) Matt.26:29. (b) Eph.5:26; Tit.3:5. (c) Mark 14:24; 1<p>

Exod.13:9; 1 Pet.3:21; 1 Cor.10:1-4.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 79.</b><p>
<b></b>Why then doth Christ call the bread "his body", and the cup "his blood",
or "the new covenant in his blood"; and Paul the "communion of body and blood
of Christ"?<p>
<b>A.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ speaks thus, not without great reason,
namely, not only thereby to teach us, that as bread and wine support this
temporal life, so his crucified body and shed blood are the true meat and
drink, whereby our souls are fed to eternal life; (a)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but more especially by these visible signs and
pledges to assure us, that we are as really partakers of his true body and
blood by the operation of the Holy Ghost as we receive by the mouths of our
bodies these holy signs in remembrance of him; (b)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that all his sufferings and obedience are as
certainly ours, as if we had in our own persons suffered and made satisfaction
for our sins to God.<br>

30. Lord's Day</h4>
<p>
<b>Q. 80.</b><p>
<b></b>What difference is there between the Lord's supper and the popish
mass?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>The Lord's supper testifies to us, that we have a full pardon of all sin
by the only sacrifice of Jesus Christ, which he himself has once accomplished
on the cross; (a)<p>
and, that we by the Holy Ghost are ingrafted into Christ, (b)<p>
who, according to his human nature is now not on earth, but in heaven, at the
right hand of God his Father, (c)<p>
and will there be worshipped by us. (d)<p>
But the mass teaches, that the living and dead have not the pardon of sins
through the sufferings of Christ, unless Christ is also daily offered for them
by the priests; and further, that Christ is bodily under the form of bread and
wine, and therefore is to be worshipped in them; so that the mass, at bottom,
is nothing else than a denial of the one sacrifice and sufferings of Jesus
Christ, and an accursed idolatry. (e)<p>

<b></b>For those who are truly sorrowful for their sins, and yet trust that
these are forgiven them for the sake of Christ;  and that their remaining
infirmities are covered by his passion and death;  and who also earnestly
desire to have their faith more and more strengthened, and their lives more
holy;  but hypocrites, and such as turn not to God with sincere hearts, eat and
drink judgment to themselves. (a)<p>
<p>
(a) 1 Cor.10:19-22; 1 Cor.11:28,29.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 82.</b><p>
<b></b>Are they also to be admitted to this supper, who, by confession and
life, declare themselves unbelieving and ungodly?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>No;  for by this, the covenant of God would be profaned, and his wrath
kindled against the whole congregation; (a)<p>
therefore it is the duty of the christian church, according to the appointment
of Christ and his apostles, to exclude such persons, by the keys of the kingdom
of heaven, till they show amendment of life.<p>

<b>Q. 83.</b><p>
<b></b>What are the keys of the kingdom of heaven?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>The preaching of the holy gospel, and christian discipline, or
excommunication out of the christian church;  by these two, the kingdom of
heaven is opened to believers, and shut against unbelievers.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 84.</b><p>
<b></b>How is the kingdom of heaven opened and shut by the preaching of the
holy gospel?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Thus: when according to the command of Christ, it is declared and
publicly testified to all and every believer, that, whenever they receive the
promise of the gospel by a true faith, all their sins are really forgiven them
of God, for the sake of Christ's merits;  and on the contrary, when it is
declared and testified to all unbelievers, and such as do not sincerely repent,
that they stand exposed to the wrath of God, and eternal condemnation, so long
as they are unconverted: (a)  according to which testimony of the gospel, God
will judge them, both in this, and in the life to come.<p>

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 85.</b><p>
<b></b>How is the kingdom of heaven shut and opened by christian discipline?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Thus: when according to the command of Christ, those, who under the name
of christians, maintain doctrines, or practices inconsistent therewith, and
will not, after having been often brotherly admonished, renounce their errors
and wicked course of life, are complained of to the church, or to those, who
are thereunto appointed by the church;  and if they despise their admonition,
are by them forbidden the use of the sacraments;  whereby they are excluded
from the christian church, and by God himself from the kingdom of Christ;  and
when they promise and show real amendment, are again received as members of
Christ and his church. (a)<p>

Christ, without any merit of ours, why must we still do good works?<p>

<p>
<b>Q. 92.</b><p>
<b></b>What is the law of God?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>God spake all these words, Exodus 20:1-17 and Denteronomy 5:6-21,
saying:  I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of
Egypt, out of the house of bondage.<p>
<p>
<b>1st commandment:</b><p>
<b></b>Thou shalt have no other gods before me.<p>
<p>
<b>2nd commandment:</b><p>
<b></b>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any
thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in
the water under the earth.  Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve
them;  for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the
fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that
hate me, and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my
commandments.<p>
<p>
<b>3rd commandment:</b><p>
<b></b>Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain;  for the LORD
will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.<p>
<p>
<b>4th commandment:</b><p>
<b></b>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.  Six days shalt thou labour,
and do all thy work;  but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God:
in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy
manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is
within thy gates.  For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
all that in them is, and rested the seventh day:  wherefore the LORD blessed
the sabbath day, and hallowed it.<p>

land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.<p>

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 97.</b><p>
<b></b>Are images then not at all to be made?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>God neither can, nor may be represented by any means: (a)<p>
but as to creatures;  though they may be represented, yet God forbids to make,
or have any resemblance of them, either in order to worship them or to serve
God by them. (b)<p>

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 98.</b><p>
<b></b>But may not images be tolerated in the churches, as books to the
laity?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>

people taught, not by dumb images, (a)<p>
but by the lively preaching of his word. (b)<p>

<p>
<b>Q. 99.</b><p>
<b></b>What is required in the third commandment?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>That we, not only by cursing (a)<p>
or perjury, (b)<p>
but also by rash swearing, (c)<p>
must not profane or abuse the name of God;  nor by silence or connivance be
partakers of these horrible sins in others; (d)<p>
and, briefly, that we use the holy name of God no otherwise than with fear and
reverence; (e)<p>
so that he may be rightly confessed (f)<p>
and worshipped by us, (g)<p>
and be glorified in all our words and works. (h)<p>

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 100.</b><p>
<b></b>Is then the profaning of God's name, by swearing and cursing, so heinous
a sin, that his wrath is kindled against those who do not endeavour, as much as
in them lies, to prevent and forbid such cursing and swearing?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>It undoubtedly is, (a)<p>
for there is no sin greater or more provoking to God, than the profaning of his
name;  and therefore he has commanded this sin to be punished with death. (b)<p>

<p>
<b>Q. 101.</b><p>
<b></b>May we then swear religiously by the name of God?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Yes:  either when the magistrates demand it of the subjects; or when
necessity requires us thereby to confirm a fidelity and truth to the glory of
God, and the safety of our neighbour: for such an oath is founded on God's
word, (a)<p>
and therefore was justly used by the saints, both in the Old and New Testament.

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 102.</b><p>
<b></b>May we also swear by saints or any other creatures?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>No;  for a lawful oath is calling upon God, as the only one who knows
the heart, that he will bear witness to the truth, and punish me if I swear
falsely; (a)<p>
which honour is due to no creature. (b)<p>

<b></b>What does God require in the fourth commandment?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>First, that the ministry of the gospel and the schools be maintained;
(a)<p>
and that I, especially on the sabbath, that is, on the day of rest, diligently
frequent the church of God, (b)<p>
to hear his word, (c)<p>
to use the sacraments, (d)<p>
publicly to call upon the Lord, (e)<p>
and contribute to the relief of the poor. (f)<p>
Secondly, that all the days of my life I cease from my evil works, and yield
myself to the Lord, to work by his Holy Spirit in me:  and thus begin in this
life the eternal sabbath. (g)<p>

<b></b>What does God require in the fifth commandment?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>That I show all honour, love and fidelity, to my father and mother, and
all in authority over me, and submit myself to their good instruction and
correction, with due obedience; (a)<p>
and also patiently bear with their weaknesses and infirmities, (b)<p>

40. Lord's Day</h4>
<p>
<b>Q. 105.</b><p>
<b></b>What does God require in the sixth commandment?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>That neither in thoughts, nor words, nor gestures, much less in deeds, I
dishonour, hate, wound, or kill my neighbour, by myself or by another: (a)<p>
but that I lay aside all desire of revenge: (b)<p>
also, that I hurt not myself, nor wilfully expose myself to any danger. (c)<p>
Wherefore also the magistrate is armed with the sword, to prevent murder. (d)<p>
<p>

Exod.21:14; Matt.26:52; Rom.13:4.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 106.</b><p>
<b></b>But this commandment seems only to speak of murder?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>In forbidding murder, God teaches us, that he abhors the causes thereof,
such as envy, (a)<p>
hatred, (b)<p>
anger, (c)<p>
and desire of revenge;  and that he accounts all these as murder. (d)<p>
<p>
(a) Prov.14:30; Rom.1:29. (b) 1 John 2:9,11. (c) James 1:20;<p>
Gal.5:19,21. (d) 1 John 3:15.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 107.</b><p>
<b></b>But is it enough that we do not kill any man in the manner mentioned
above?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>No:  for when God forbids envy, hatred, and anger, he commands us to
love our neighbour as ourselves; (a)<p>
to show patience, peace, meekness, mercy, and all kindness, towards him, (b)<p>
and prevent his hurt as much as in us lies; (c)<p>
and that we do good, even to our enemies. (d)<p>

<p>
<b>Q. 108.</b><p>
<b></b>What does the seventh commandment teach us?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>That all uncleanness is accursed of God: (a)<p>
and that therefore we must with all our hearts detest the same, (b)<p>
and live chastely and temperately, (c)<p>
whether in holy wedlock, or in single life. (d)<p>

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 109.</b><p>
<b></b>Does God forbid in this commandment, only adultery, and such like gross
sins?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Since both our body and soul are temples of the holy Ghost, he commands
us to preserve them pure and holy:  therefore he forbids all unchaste actions,
gestures, words, (a)<p>
thoughts, desires, (b)<p>
and whatever can entice men thereto. (c)<p>
<p>

<p>
<b>Q. 110.</b><p>
<b></b>What does God forbid in the eighth commandment?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>God forbids not only those thefts, (a)<p>
and robberies, (b)<p>
which are punishable by the magistrate;  but he comprehends under the name of
theft all wicked tricks and devices, whereby we design to appropriate to
ourselves the goods which belong to our neighbour: (c)<p>
whether it be by force, or under the appearance of right, as by unjust weights,
ells, measures, fraudulent merchandise, (d)<p>
false coins, usury, (e)<p>
or by any other way forbidden by God;  as also all covetousness, (f)<p>
all abuse and waste of his gifts. (g)<p>

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 111.</b><p>
<b></b>But what does God require in this commandment?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>That I promote the advantage of my neighbour in every instance I can or
may;  and deal with him as I desire to be dealt with by others: (a)<p>
further also that I faithfully labour, so that I may be able to relieve the
needy. (b)<p>

nor falsify any man's words; (b)<p>
that I be no backbiter, nor slanderer; (c)<p>
that I do not judge, nor join in condemning any man rashly, or unheard; (d)<p>
but that I avoid all sorts of lies and deceit, as the proper works of the
devil, (e)<p>
unless I would bring down upon me the heavy wrath of God; (f)<p>
likewise, that in judgment and all other dealings I love the truth, speak it
uprightly and confess it; (g)<p>
also that I defend and promote, as much as I am able, the horror and good
character of my neighbour. (h)<p>

<b></b>What does the tenth commandment require of us?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>

commandments, never rise in our hearts;  but that at all times we hate all sin
with our whole heart, and delight in all righteousness. (a)<p>
<p>
(a) Rom.7:7.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 114.</b><p>
<b></b>But can those who are converted to God perfectly keep these
commandments?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>No: but even the holiest men, while in this life, have only a small
beginning of this obedience; (a)<p>
yet so, that with a sincere resolution they begin to live, not only according
to some, but all the commandments of God. (b)<p>
<p>
(a) 1 John 1:8-10; Rom.7:14,15; Eccl.7:20; 1 Cor.13:9. (b) Rom.7:22;<p>
Ps.1:2; James 2:10.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 115.</b><p>
<b></b>Why will God then have the ten commandments so strictly preached, since
no man in this life can keep them?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>First, that all our lifetime we may learn more and more to know (a)<p>
our sinful nature, and thus become the more earnest in seeking the remission of
sin, and righteousness in Christ; (b)<p>
likewise, that we constantly endeavour and pray to God for the grace of the
Holy Spirit, that we may become more and more conformable to the image of God,
till we arrive at the perfection proposed to us, in a life to come. (c)<p>

45. Lord's Day</h4>
<p>
<b>Q. 116.</b><p>
<b></b>Why is prayer necessary for christians?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>Because it is the chief part of thankfulness which God requires of us:
(a)<p>
and also, because God will give his grace and  Holy Spirit to those only,<p>
who with sincere desires continually ask them of him, and are thankful for
them. (b)<p>
<p>
(a) Ps.50:14,15. (b) Matt.7:7,8; Luke 11:9,10,13; 1 Thess.5:17.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 117.</b><p>
<b></b>What are the requisites of that prayer, which is acceptable to God, and
which he will hear?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>First, that we from the heart pray (a)<p>
to the one true God only, who has manifested himself in his word, (b)<p>
for all things, he has commanded us to ask of him; (c)<p>
secondly, that we rightly and thoroughly know our need and misery, (d)<p>
that so we may deeply humble ourselves in the presence of his divine majesty;
(e)<p>
thirdly, that we be fully persuaded that he, notwithstanding that we are
unworthy of it, will, for the sake of Christ our Lord, certainly hear our
prayer, (f)<p>
as he has promised us in his word. (g)<p>

<hr><p>
<b>Q. 118.</b><p>

<h4 align=center>
46. Lord's Day</h4>
<p>
<b>Q. 120.</b><p>
<b></b>Why has Christ commanded us to address God thus: "Our Father"?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>
<b></b>That immediately, in the very beginning of our prayer, he might excite
in us a childlike reverence for, and confidence in God, which are the
foundation of our prayer:  namely, that God is become our Father in Christ, and
will much less deny us what we ask of him in true faith, than our parents will
refuse us earthly things. (a)<p>
<p>
(a) Matt.7:9-11; Luke 11:11-13.
<hr><p>
<b>Q. 121.</b><p>
<b></b>Why is it here added, "Which art in heaven"?<p>
<b>A.</b><p>

(a)<p>
and that we may expect from his almighty power all things necessary for soul
and body. (b)<p>
