<span class="small">'Ah! then, as now--it may be, something more--  
Woman and man were human to the core  
.         .         .         .         .         .  
They too could risk, they also could rebel,  
They could love wisely--they could love too well.  
In that great duel of Sex--that ancient strife  
Which is the very central fact of life,  
They could--and did--engage it breath for breath,  
They could--and did--get wounded unto death.  
As at all times since time for us began,  
Woman was truly woman, man was man.  
.         .         .         .         .         .  
Dead--dead and done with! Swift from shine to shade  
The roaring generations flit and fade.  
To this one, fading, flitting, like the rest,  
We come to proffer--be it worst or best--  
A sketch, a shadow, of one brave old time;  
A hint of what it might have held sublime;  
A dream, an idyll, call it what you will,  
Of man still Man, and woman--Woman still!'</span>
