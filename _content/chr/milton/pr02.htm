<p>Mean while the new-baptiz&#8217;d, who yet remained<br> At Jordan with the Baptist, and had seen<br> Him whom they heard so late expressly call&#8217;d<br> Jesus Messiah, Son of God, declared,<br> And on that high authority had believed,<br> And with him talked, and with him lodged&#8212;I mean<br> Andrew and Simon, famous after known,<br> With others, though in Holy Writ not named&#8212;<br> Now missing him, their joy so lately found,<br> So lately found and so abruptly gone,<br> Began to doubt, and doubted many days,<br> And, as the days increased, increased their doubt.<br> Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn,<br> And for a time caught up to God, as once<br> Moses was in the Mount and missing long,<br> And the great Thisbite, who on fiery wheels<br> Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come.<br> Therefore, as those young prophets then with care<br> Sought lost Eliah, so in each place these<br> Nigh to Bethabara&#8212;in Jericho<br> The city of Palms, Aenon, and Salem old,<br> Machaerus, and each town or city walled<br> On this side the broad lake Genezaret,<br> Or in Peraea-but returned in vain.<br> Then on the bank of Jordan, by a creek,<br> Where winds with reeds and osiers whispering play,<br> Plain fishermen (no greater men them call),<br> Close in a cottage low together got,<br> Their unexpected loss and plaints outbreathed:&#8212;</p>  
<p>"Alas, from what high hope to what relapse<br> Unlooked for are we fallen! Our eyes beheld<br> Messiah certainly now come, so long<br> Expected of our fathers; we have heard<br> His words, his wisdom full of grace and truth.<br> 'Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand;<br> The kingdom shall to Israel be restored:'<br> Thus we rejoiced, but soon our joy is turned<br> Into perplexity and new amaze.<br> For whither is he gone? what accident<br> Hath rapt him from us? will he now retire<br> After appearance, and again prolong<br> Our expectation? God of Israel,<br> Send thy Messiah forth; the time is come.<br> Behold the kings of the earth, how they oppress<br> Thy Chosen, to what highth their power unjust<br> They have exalted, and behind them cast<br> All fear of Thee; arise, and vindicate<br> Thy glory; free thy people from their yoke!<br> But let us wait; thus far He hath performed&#8212;<br> Sent his Anointed, and to us revealed him<br> By his great Prophet pointed at and shown<br> In public, and with him we have conversed.<br> Let us be glad of this, and all our fears<br> Lay on his providence; He will not fail,<br> Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall&#8212;<br> Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence:<br> Soon we shall see our hope, our joy, return."</p>  
<p>Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume<br> To find whom at the first they found unsought.<br> But to his mother Mary, when she saw<br> Others returned from baptism, not her Son,<br> Nor left at Jordan tidings of him none,<br> Within her breast though calm, her breast though pure,<br> Motherly cares and fears got head, and raised<br> Some troubled thoughts, which she in sight thus clad:&#8212;</p>  
<p>"Oh, what avails me now that honour high,<br> To have conceived of God, or that salute,<br> 'Hail, highly favoured, among women blest!'<br> While I to sorrows am no less advanced,<br> And fears as eminent above the lot<br> Of other women, by the birth I bore:<br> In such a season born, when scarce a shed<br> Could be obtained to shelter him or me<br> From the bleak air? A stable was our warmth,<br> A manger his; yet soon enforced to fly<br> Thence into Egypt, till the murderous king<br> Were dead, who sought his life, and, missing, filled<br> With infant blood the streets of Bethlehem.<br> From Egypt home returned, in Nazareth<br> Hath been our dwelling many years; his life<br> Private, unactive, calm, contemplative,<br> Little suspicious to any king. But now,<br> Full grown to man, acknowledged, as I hear,<br> By John the Baptist, and in public shewn,<br> Son owned from Heaven by his Father's voice,<br> I looked for some great change, To honour? no;<br> But trouble, as old Simeon plain foretold,<br> That to the fall and rising he should be<br> Of many in Israel, and to a sign<br> Spoken against-that through my very soul<br> A sword shall pierce. This is my favoured lot,<br> My exaltation to afflictions high!<br> Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest!<br> I will not argue that, nor will repine.<br> But where delays he now? Some great intent<br> Conceals him. When twelve years he scarce had seen,<br> I lost him, but so found as well I saw<br> He could not lose himself, but went about<br> His Father's business. What he meant I mused&#8212;<br> Since understand; much more his absence now<br> Thus long to some great purpose he obscures.<br> But I to wait with patience am inured;<br> My heart hath been a storehouse long of things<br> And sayings laid up, portending strange events."</p>  
<p>Thus, Mary, pondering oft, and oft to mind<br> Recalling what remarkably had passed<br> Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts<br> Meekly composed awaited the fulfilling:<br> The while her Son, tracing the desert wild,<br> Sole, but with holiest meditations fed,<br> Into himself descended, and at once<br> All his great work to come before him set&#8212;<br> How to begin, how to accomplish best<br> His end of being on Earth, and mission high.<br> For Satan, with sly preface to return,<br> Had left him vacant, and with speed was gone<br> Up to the middle region of thick air,<br> Where all his Potentates in council sate.<br> There, without sign of boast, or sign of joy,<br> Solicitous and blank, he thus began:&#8212;</p>  
<p>"Princes, Heaven's ancient Sons, Aethereal Thrones&#8212;<br> Daemonian Spirits now, from the element<br> Each of reign allotted, rightlier called<br> Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath<br> (So may we hold our place and these mild seats<br> Without new trouble!)-such an enemy<br> Is risen to invade us, who no less<br> Threatens than our expulsion down to Hell.<br> I, as I undertook, and with the vote<br> Consenting in full frequence was impowered,<br> Have found him, viewed him, tasted him; but find<br> Far other labour to be undergone<br> Than when I dealt with Adam, first of men,<br> Though Adam by his wife's allurement fell,<br> However to this Man inferior far&#8212;<br> If he be Man by mother's side, at least<br> With more than human gifts from Heaven adorned,<br> Perfections absolute, graces divine,<br> And amplitude of mind to greatest deeds.<br> Therefore I am returned, lest confidence<br> Of my success with Eve in Paradise<br> Deceive ye to persuasion over-sure<br> Of like succeeding here. I summon all<br> Rather to be in readiness with hand<br> Or counsel to assist, lest I, who erst<br> Thought none my equal, now be overmatched."</p>  
<p>So spoke the old Serpent, doubting, and from all<br> With clamour was assured their utmost aid<br> At his command; when from amidst them rose<br> Belial, the dissolutest Spirit that fell,<br> The sensualest, and, after Asmodai,<br> The fleshliest Incubus, and thus advise. -</p>  
<p>"Set women in his eye and in his walk,<br> Among daughters of men the fairest found.<br> Many are in each region passing fair<br> As the noon sky, more like to goddesses<br> Than mortal creatures, graceful and discreet,<br> Expert in amorous arts, enchanting tongues<br> Persuasive, virgin majesty with mild<br> And sweet allayed, yet terrible to approach,<br> Skilled to retire, and in retiring draw<br> Hearts after them tangled in amorous nets.<br> Such object hath the power to soften and tame<br> Severest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow,<br> Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve,<br> Draw out with credulous desire, and lead<br> At will the manliest, resolutest breast,<br> As the magnetic hardest iron draws.<br> Women, when nothing else, beguiled the heart<br> Of wisest Solomon, and made him build,<br> And made him bow, to the gods of his wives."</p>  
<p>To whom quick answer Satan thus returned:&#8212;<br> "Belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh'st<br> All others by thyself. Because of old<br> Thou thyself doat'st on womankind, admiring<br> Their shape, their colour, and attractive grace,<br> None are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys.<br> Before the Flood, thou, with thy lusty crew,<br> False titled Sons of God, roaming the Earth,<br> Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men,<br> And coupled with them, and begot a race.<br> Have we not seen, or by relation heard,<br> In courts and regal chambers how thou lurk'st,<br> In wood or grove, by mossy fountain-side,<br> In valley or green meadow, to waylay<br> Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene,<br> Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa,<br> Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more<br> Too long-then lay'st thy scapes on names adored,<br> Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan,<br> Satyr, or Faun, or Silvan? But these haunts<br> Delight not all. Among the sons of men<br> How many have with a smile made small account<br> Of beauty and her lures, easily scorned<br> All her assaults, on worthier things intent!<br> Remember that Pellean conqueror,<br> A youth, how all the beauties of the East<br> He slightly viewed, and slightly overpassed;<br> How he surnamed of Africa dismissed,<br> In his prime youth, the fair Iberian maid.<br> For Solomon, he lived at ease, and, full<br> Of honour, wealth, high fare, aimed not beyond<br> Higher design than to enjoy his state;<br> Thence to the bait of women lay exposed.<br> But he whom we attempt is wiser far<br> Than Solomon, of more exalted mind,<br> Made and set wholly on the accomplishment<br> Of greatest things. What woman will you find,<br> Though of this age the wonder and the fame,<br> On whom his leisure will voutsafed an eye<br> Of fond desire? Or should she, confident,<br> As sitting queen adored on Beauty's throne,<br> Descend with all her winning charms begirt<br> To enamour, as the zone of Venus once<br> Wrought that effect on Jove (so fables tell),<br> How would one look from his majestic brow,<br> Seated as on the top of Virtue's hill,<br> Discountenance her despised, and put to rout<br> All her array, her female pride deject,<br> Or turn to reverent awe! For Beauty stands<br> In the admiration only of weak minds<br> Led captive; cease to admire, and all her plumes<br> Fall flat, and shrink into a trivial toy,<br> At every sudden slighting quite abashed.<br> Therefore, with manlier objects we must try<br> His constancy-with such as have more shew<br> Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise<br> (Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wrecked);<br> Or that which only seems to satisfy<br> Lawful desires of nature, not beyond.<br> And now I know he hungers, where no food<br> Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness:<br> The rest commit to me; I shall let pass<br> No advantage, and his strength as oft assay."</p>  
<p>He ceased, and heard their grant in loud acclaim;<br> The forthwith to him takes a chosen band<br> Of Spirits likest to himself in guile,<br> To be at hand and at his beck appear,<br> If cause were to unfold some active scene<br> Of various persons, each to know his part;<br> Then to the desert takes with these his flight,<br> Where still, from shade to shade, the Son of God,<br> After forty days' fasting, had remained,<br> Now hungering first, and to himself thus said:&#8212;</p>  
<p>"Where will this end? Four times ten days I have passed<br> Wandering this woody maze, and human food<br> Nor tasted, nor had appetite. That fast<br> To virtue I impute not, or count part<br> Of what I suffer here. If nature need not,<br> Or God support nature without repast,<br> Though needing, what praise is it to endure?<br> But now I feel I hunger; which declares<br> Nature hath need of what she asks. Yet God<br> Can satisfy that need some other way,<br> Though hunger still remain. So it remain<br> Without this body's wasting, I content me,<br> And from the sting of famine fear no harm;<br> Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts, that feed<br> Me hungering more to do my Father's will."</p>  
<p>It was the hour of night, when thus the Son<br> Communed in silent walk, then laid him down<br> Under the hospitable covert nigh<br> Of trees thick interwoven. There he slept,<br> And dreamed, as appetite is wont to dream,<br> Of meats and drinks, nature's refreshment sweet.<br> Him thought he by the brook of Cherith stood,<br> And saw the ravens with their horny beaks<br> Food to Elijah bringing even and morn&#8212;<br> Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought;<br> He saw the Prophet also, how he fled<br> Into the desert, and how there he slept<br> Under a juniper-then how, awaked,<br> He found his supper on the coals prepared,<br> And by the Angel was bid rise and eat,<br> And eat the second time after repose,<br> The strength whereof sufficed him forty days:<br> Sometimes that with Elijah he partook,<br> Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse.<br> Thus wore out night; and now the herald Lark<br> Left his ground-nest, high towering to descry<br> The Morn's approach, and greet her with his song.<br> As lightly from his grassy couch up rose<br> Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream;<br> Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting waked.<br> Up to a hill anon his steps he reared,<br> From whose high top to ken the prospect round,<br> If cottage were in view, sheep-cote, or herd;<br> But cottage, herd, or sheep-cote, none he saw&#8212;<br> Only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove,<br> With chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud.<br> Thither he bent his way, determined there<br> To rest at noon, and entered soon the shade<br> High-roofed, and walks beneath, and alleys brown,<br> That opened in the midst a woody scene;<br> Nature's own work it seemed (Nature taught Art),<br> And, to a superstitious eye, the haunt<br> Of wood-gods and wood-nymphs. He viewed it round;<br> When suddenly a man before him stood,<br> Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad,<br> As one in city or court or palace bred,<br> And with fair speech these words to him addressed:&#8212;</p>  
<p>"With granted leave officious I return,<br> But much more wonder that the Son of God<br> In this wild solitude so long should bide,<br> Of all things destitute, and, well I know,<br> Not without hunger. Others of some note,<br> As story tells, have trod this wilderness:<br> The fugitive Bond-woman, with her son,<br> Outcast Nebaioth, yet found here relief<br> By a providing Angel; all the race<br> Of Israel here had famished, had not God<br> Rained from heaven manna; and that Prophet bold,<br> Native of Thebez, wandering here, was fed<br> Twice by a voice inviting him to eat.<br> Of thee these forty days none hath regard,<br> Forty and more deserted here indeed."</p>  
<p>To whom thus Jesus:&#8212;"What conclud'st thou hence?<br> They all had need; I, as thou seest, have none."</p>  
<p>"How hast thou hunger then?" Satan replied.<br> "Tell me, if food were now before thee set,<br> Wouldst thou not eat?" "Thereafter as I like<br> The giver," answered Jesus. "Why should that<br> Cause thy refusal?" said the subtle Fiend.<br> "Hast thou not right to all created things?<br> Owe not all creatures, by just right, to thee<br> Duty and service, nor to stay till bid,<br> But tender all their power? Nor mention I<br> Meats by the law unclean, or offered first<br> To idols-those young Daniel could refuse;<br> Nor proffered by an enemy-though who<br> Would scruple that, with want oppressed? Behold,<br> Nature ashamed, or, better to express,<br> Troubled, that thou shouldst hunger, hath purveyed<br> From all the elements her choicest store,<br> To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord<br> With honour. Only deign to sit and eat."</p>  
<p>He spake no dream: for, as his words had end,<br> Our Saviour, lifting up his eyes, beheld,<br> In ample space under the broadest shade,<br> A table richly spread in regal mode,<br> With dishes piled and meats of noblest sort<br> And savour-beasts of chase, or fowl of game,<br> In pastry built, or from the spit, or boiled,<br> Grisamber-steamed; all fish, from sea or shore,<br> Freshet or purling brook, of shell or fin,<br> And exquisitest name, for which was drained<br> Pontus, and Lucrine bay, and Afric coast<br> Alas! how simple, to these cates compared,<br> Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve!<br> And at a stately sideboard, by the wine,<br> That fragrant smell diffused, in order stood<br> Tall stripling youths rich-clad, of fairer hue<br> Than Ganymed or Hylas; distant more,<br> Under the trees now tripped, now solemn stood,<br> Nymphs of Diana's train, and Naiades<br> With fruits and flowers from Amalthea's horn,<br> And ladies of the Hesperides, that seemed<br> Fairer than feigned of old, or fabled since<br> Of faery damsels met in forest wide<br> By knights of Logres, or of Lyones,<br> Lancelot, or Pelleas, or Pellenore.<br> And all the while harmonious airs were heard<br> Of chiming strings or charming pipes; and winds<br> Of gentlest gale Arabian odours fanned<br> From their soft wings, and Flora's earliest smells.<br> Such was the splendour; and the Tempter now<br> His invitation earnestly renewed:&#8212;</p>  
<p>"What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat?<br> These are not fruits forbidden; no interdict<br> Defends the touching of these viands pure;<br> Their taste no knowledge works, at least of evil,<br> But life preserves, destroys life's enemy,<br> Hunger, with sweet restorative delight.<br> All these are Spirits of air, and woods, and springs,<br> Thy gentle ministers, who come to pay<br> Thee homage, and acknowledge thee their Lord.<br> What doubt'st thou, Son of God? Sit down and eat."</p>  
<p>To whom thus Jesus temperately replied:&#8212;<br> "Said'st thou not that to all things I had right?<br> And who withholds my power that right to use?<br> Shall I receive by gift what of my own,<br> When and where likes me best, I can command?<br> I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou,<br> Command a table in this wilderness,<br> And call swift flights of Angels ministrant,<br> Arrayed in glory, on my cup to attend:<br> Why shouldst thou, then, obtrude this diligence<br> In vain, where no acceptance it can find?<br> And with my hunger what hast thou to do?<br> Thy pompous delicacies I contemn,<br> And count thy specious gifts no gifts, but guiles."</p>  
<p>To whom thus answered Satan, malecontent:&#8212;<br> "That I have also power to give thou seest;<br> If of that power I bring thee voluntary<br> What I might have bestowed on whom I pleased,<br> And rather opportunely in this place<br> Chose to impart to thy apparent need,<br> Why shouldst thou not accept it? But I see<br> What I can do or offer is suspect.<br> Of these things others quickly will dispose,<br> Whose pains have earned the far-fet spoil." With that<br> Both table and provision vanished quite,<br> With sound of harpies' wings and talons heard;<br> Only the impor'tune Tempter still remained,<br> And with these words his temptation pursued:&#8212;</p>  
<p>"By hunger, that each other creature tames,<br> Thou art not to be harmed, therefore not moved;<br> Thy temperance, invincible besides,<br> For no allurement yields to appetite;<br> And all thy heart is set on high designs,<br> High actions. But wherewith to be achieved?<br> Great acts require great means of enterprise;<br> Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth,<br> A carpenter thy father known, thyself<br> Bred up in poverty and straits at home,<br> Lost in a desert here and hunger-bit.<br> Which way, or from what hope, dost thou aspire<br> To greatness? whence authority deriv'st?<br> What followers, what retin'ue canst thou gain,<br> Or at thy heels the dizzy multitude,<br> Longer than thou canst feed them on thy cost?<br> Money brings honour, friends, conquest, and realms.<br> What raised Antipater the Edomite,<br> And his son Herod placed on Juda's throne,<br> Thy throne, but gold, that got him puissant friends?<br> Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive,<br> Get riches first, get wealth, and treasure heap&#8212;<br> Not difficult, if thou hearken to me.<br> Riches are mine, fortune is in my hand;<br> They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain,<br> While virtue, valour, wisdom, sit in want."</p>  
<p>To whom thus Jesus patiently replied:&#8212;<br> "Yet wealth without these three is impotent<br> To gain dominion, or to keep it gained&#8212;<br> Witness those ancient empires of the earth,<br> In highth of all their flowing wealth dissolved;<br> But men endued with these have oft attained,<br> In lowest poverty, to highest deeds&#8212;<br> Gideon, and Jephtha, and the shepherd lad<br> Whose offspring on the throne of Juda sate<br> So many ages, and shall yet regain<br> That seat, and reign in Israel without end.<br> Among the Heathen (for throughout the world<br> To me is not unknown what hath been done<br> Worthy of memorial) canst thou not remember<br> Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus?<br> For I esteem those names of men so poor,<br> Who could do mighty things, and could contemn<br> Riches, though offered from the hand of kings<br> And what in me seems wanting but that I<br> May also in this poverty as soon<br> Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more?<br> Extol not riches, then, the toil of fools,<br> The wise man's cumbrance, if not snare; more apt<br> To slacken virtue and abate her edge<br> Than prompt her to do aught may merit praise.<br> What if with like aversion I reject<br> Riches and realms! Yet not for that a crown,<br> Golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns,<br> Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights,<br> To him who wears the regal diadem,<br> When on his shoulders each man's burden lies;<br> For therein stands the office of a king,<br> His honour, virtue, merit, and chief praise,<br> That for the public all this weight he bears.<br> Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules<br> Passions, desires, and fears, is more a king&#8212;<br> Which every wise and virtuous man attains;<br> And who attains not, ill aspires to rule<br> Cities of men, or headstrong multitudes,<br> Subject himself to anarchy within,<br> Or lawless passions in him, which he serves.<br> But to guide nations in the way of truth<br> By saving doctrine, and from error lead<br> To know, and, knowing, worship God aright,<br> Is yet more kingly. This attracts the soul,<br> Governs the inner man, the nobler part;<br> That other o'er the body only reigns,<br> And oft by force-which to a generous mind<br> So reigning can be no sincere delight.<br> Besides, to give a kingdom hath been thought<br> Greater and nobler done, and to lay down<br> Far more magnanimous, than to assume.<br> Riches are needless, then, both for themselves,<br> And for thy reason why they should be sought&#8212;<br> To gain a sceptre, oftest better miss&#8217;t."</p>
