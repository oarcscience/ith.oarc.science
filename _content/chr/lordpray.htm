<H1>The Lord's Prayer in Latin:</H1>
</CENTER>

PATER noster, qui
es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum. Adveniat regnum
tuum. Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo et in terra. Panem
nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie, et dimitte nobis debita
nostra sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris. Et ne
nos inducas in tentationem, sed libera nos a malo. Amen.

<H1>The Lord's Prayer in English:</H1>
</CENTER>
         
OUR Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy
will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day
our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those who trespass against us. And lead us not into
temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</P>
