<h2 ALIGN="CENTER"><span style="font-weight: 400">&quot;THE PILGRIM&#39;S PROGRESS.&quot;</span></h2>
<p ALIGN="left">IF <i>The Holy War </i>is an unfit subject for allegorical treatment,
<i>The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress </i>is no less perfectly adapted for it. <i>The Holy War
</i>is a representation of the struggle of human nature with evil, and the struggle 
is left undecided. <i>The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress </i>is a representation of the efforts 
of a single soul after holiness, which has its natural termination when the soul 
quits its mortal home and crosses the dark river. Each one of us has his own life-battle 
to fight out, his own sorrows and trials, his own failures or successes, and his 
own end. He wins the game, or he loses it. The account is wound up, and the curtain 
falls upon him. Here Bunyan had a material as excellent in itself as it was exactly 
suited to his peculiar genius; and his treatment of the subject from his own point 
of view--that of English Protestant Christianity-- is unequalled, and never will be 
equalled. I may say never, for in this world of change the point of view alters 
fast, and never continues in one stay. As we are swept along the stream of time, 
lights and shadows shift their places, mountain plateaus turn to sharp peaks, mountain 
ranges dissolve into vapour. The river which has been gliding deep and slow along 
the plain, leaps suddenly over a precipice and plunges foaming down a sunless gorge.
</p>
<p>In the midst of changing circumstances the central question remains the same--What 
am I? what is this world, in which I appear and disappear like a bubble? who made 
me? and what am I to do? Some answer or other the mind of man demands and insists 
on receiving. Theologian or poet offers, at long intervals, explanations which are 
accepted as credible for a time. They wear out, and another follows, and then another. 
Bunyan&#39;s answer has served average English men and women for two hundred years, 
but no human being with Bunyan&#39;s intellect and Bunyan&#39;s sincerity can again use 
similar language; and <i>The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress </i>is and will remain unique of 
its kind--an imperishable monument of the form in which the problem presented itself 
to a person of singular truthfulness, simplicity, and piety, who, after many struggles, 
accepted the Puritan creed as the adequate solution of it. It was composed exactly 
at the time when it was possible for such a book to come into being--the close of 
the period when the Puritan formula was a real belief, and was about to change from 
a living principle into an intellectual opinion. So long as a religion is fully 
alive, men do not talk about it or make allegories about it. They assume its truth 
as out of reach of question, and they simply obey its precepts as they obey the 
law of the land. It becomes a subject of art and discourse only when men are unconsciously 
ceasing to believe, and therefore the more vehemently think that they believe, and 
repudiate with indignation the suggestion that doubt has found its way into them. 
After this, religion no longer governs their lives. It governs only the language 
in which they express themselves, and they preserve it eagerly, in the shape of 
elaborate observances or in the agreeable forms of art and literature. </p>
<i></i>
<p><i>The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress </i>was written before <i>The Holy War, </i>while Bunyan 
was still in prison at Bedford, and was but half conscious of the gifts which he 
possessed. It was written for his own entertainment, and therefore without the thought--so 
fatal in its effects and so hard to be resisted--of what the world would say about 
it. It was written in compulsory quiet, when he was comparatively unexcited by the 
effort of perpetual preaching, and the shapes of things could present themselves 
to him as they really were, undistorted by theological narrowness. It is the same 
story which he has told of himself in <i>Grace Abounding, </i>thrown out into an 
objective form. </p>
<p>He tells us himself, in a metrical introduction, the circumstances under which 
it was composed:-- </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When at the first I took my pen in 
hand, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus for to write, I did not understand
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I at all should make a little book
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a mode. Nay, I had undertook
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make another, which when almost done,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I was aware I this begun. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And thus it was: I writing of the 
way <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And race of saints in this our Gospel 
day, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fell suddenly into an Allegory <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About the journey and the way to glory
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In more than twenty things which I set 
down; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This done, I twenty more had in my crown,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And these again began to multiply,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like sparks that from the coals of fire 
do fly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay then, thought I, if that you breed 
so fast, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;ll put you by yourselves, lest you 
at last <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should prove <i>ad Infinitum, </i>and 
eat out <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book that I already am about. </p>
<i></i>
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&quot;Well, so I did; but yet I 
did not think <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To show to all the world my pen and ink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a mode. I only thought to make,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew not what. Nor did I undertake
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merely to please my neighbours; no, not 
I. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did it mine own self to gratify.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Neither did I but vacant seasons 
spend <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this my scribble; nor did I intend
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But to divert myself in doing this
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From worser thoughts which make me do 
amiss. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus I set pen to paper with delight,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And quickly had my thoughts in black 
and white; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For having now my method by the end,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still as I pulled it came; and so I penned
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It down: until at last it came to be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For length and breadth the bigness which 
you see. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well, when I had thus put my ends 
together, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I showed them others, that I might see 
whether <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They would condemn them or them justify.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And some said, Let them live; some, Let 
them die; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some said, John, print it; others said, 
Not so; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some said it might do good; others said, 
No. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Now was I in a strait, and did not 
see <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which was the best thing to be done by 
me. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At last I thought, since you are thus 
divided, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I print it will; and so the case decided.&quot;
</p>
<p>The difference of opinion among Bunyan&#39;s friends is easily explicable. The allegoric 
representation of religion to men profoundly convinced of the truth of it might 
naturally seem light and fantastic, and the breadth of the conception could not 
please the narrow sectarians who knew no salvation beyond the lines of their peculiar 
formulas. The Pilgrim, though in a Puritan dress, is a genuine man. His experience 
is so truly human experience, that Christians of every persuasion can identify themselves 
with him; and even those who regard Christianity itself as but a natural outgrowth 
of the conscience and intellect, and yet desire to live nobly and make the best 
of themselves, can recognise familiar footprints in every step of Christian&#39;s journey. 
Thus <i>The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress </i>is a book which, when once read, can never be 
forgotten. We too, every one of us, are pilgrims on the same road, and images and 
illustrations come back upon us from so faithful an itinerary, as we encounter similar 
trials, and learn for ourselves the accuracy with which Bunyan has described them. 
There is no occasion to follow a story minutely which memory can so universally 
supply. I need pause only at a few spots which are too charming to pass by. </p>
<p>How picturesque and vivid are the opening lines: &quot;As I walked through the wilderness 
of this world I lighted on a certain place where there was a den,[<a name="text1" href="#foot1">1</a>] 
and I laid me down in that place to sleep, and as I slept I dreamed a dream. I dreamed, 
and behold I saw a man, a man clothed in rags, standing with his face from his own 
home with a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back.&quot; </p>
<p>The man is Bunyan himself as we see him in <i>Grace Abounding. </i>His sins are 
the burden upon his back. He reads his book and weeps and trembles. He speaks of 
his fears to his friends and kindred. They think &quot;some frenzy distemper has got 
into his head.&quot; He meets a man in the fields whose name is Evangelist. Evangelist 
tells him to flee from the City of Destruction. He shows him the way by which he 
must go, and points to the far-off light which will guide him to the wicket-gate. 
He sets off, and his neighbours of course think him mad. The world always thinks 
men mad who turn their backs upon it. Obstinate and Pliable (how well we know them 
both!) follow to persuade him to return. Obstinate talks practical common sense 
to him, and, as it has no effect, gives him up as a fantastical fellow. Pliable 
thinks that there may be something in what he says, and offers to go with him.
</p>
<p>Before they can reach the wicket-gate they fall into a &quot;miry slough.&quot; Who does 
not know the miry slough too? When a man begins for the first time to think seriously 
about himself, the first thing that <i>rises, </i>before him is a consciousness 
of his miserable past life. Amendment seems to be desperate. He thinks it is too 
late to change for any useful purpose, and he sinks into despondency. </p>
<p>Pliable, finding the road disagreeable, has soon had enough of it. He scrambles 
out of the slough &quot;on the side which was nearest to his own house&quot; and goes home. 
Christian, struggling manfully, is lifted out &quot;by a man whose name was Help,&quot; and 
goes on upon his journey, but the burden on his back weighs him down. He falls in 
with Mr. Worldly Wiseman, who lives in the town of Carnal Policy. Mr. Worldly Wiseman, 
who looks like a gentleman, advises him not to think about his sins. If he has done 
wrong he must alter his life and do better for the future. He directs him to a village 
called Morality, where he will find a gentleman well known in those parts, who will 
take his burden off--Mr. Legality. Either Mr. Legality will do it himself, or it 
can be done equally well by his pretty young son, Mr. Civility. </p>
<p>Tbe way to a better life does not lie in a change of outward action, but in a 
changed heart. Legality soon passes into civility, according to the saying that 
vice loses half its evil when it loses its grossness. Bunyan would have said that 
the poison was the more deadly from being concealed. Christian, after a near escape, 
is set straight again. He is admitted into the wicket-gate, and is directed how 
he is to go forward. He asks if he may not lose his way. He is answered Yes, &quot;There 
are many ways (that) butt down on this, and they are crooked and wide. But thus 
thou mayest know the right from the wrong, that only being straight and narrow.&quot;
</p>
<p>Good people often suppose that when a man is once &quot;converted,&quot; as they call it, 
and has entered on a religious life, he will find everything made easy. He has turned 
to Christ, and in Christ he will find rest and pleasantness. The path of duty is 
unfortunately not strewed with flowers at all. The primrose road leads to the other 
place. As on all other journeys, to persevere is the difficulty. The pilgrim&#39;s feet 
grow sorer the longer he walks. His lower nature follows him like a shadow, watching 
opportunities to trip him up, and ever appearing in some new disguise. In the way 
of comfort he is allowed only certain resting-places, quiet intervals of peace when 
temptation is absent, and the mind can gather strength and encouragement from a 
sense of the progress which it has made. </p>
<p>The first of these resting-places at which Christian arrives is the &quot;Interpreter&#39;s 
House.&quot; This means, I conceive, that he arrives at a right understanding of the 
objects of human desire as they really are. He learns to distinguish there between 
passion and patience, passion which demands immediate gratification, and patience 
which can wait and hope. He sees the action of grace on the heart, and sees the 
devil labouring to put it out. He sees the man in the iron cage who was once a flourishing 
professor, but had been tempted away by pleasure and had sinned </p>
<p>against light. He hears a dream too--one of Bunyan&#39;s own early dreams, but related 
as by another person. The Pilgrim himself was beyond the reach of such uneasy visions. 
But it shows how profoundly the terrible side of Christianity had seized on Bunyan&#39;s 
imagination, and how little he was able to forget it. </p>
<p>&quot;This night as I was in my sleep I dreamed, and behold the heavens grew exceeding 
black; also it thundered and lightened in most fearful wise, that it put me into 
an agony; so I looked up in my dream and saw the clouds rack at an unusual rate, 
upon which I heard a great sound of a trumpet, and saw also a man sit upon a cloud 
attended with the thousands of heaven. They were all in a flaming fire, and the 
heaven also was in a burning flame. I heard then a voice, saying, Arise ye dead 
and come to judgment; and with that the rocks rent, the graves opened, and the dead 
that were therein came forth. Some of them were exceeding glad and looked upward; 
some sought to hide themselves under the mountains. Then I saw the man that sate 
upon the cloud open the book and bid the world draw near. Yet there was, by reason 
of a fierce flame that issued out and came from before him, a convenient distance 
betwixt him and them, as betwixt the judge and the prisoners at the bar. I heard 
it also proclaimed to them that attended on the man that sate on the cloud, Gather 
together the tares, the chaff, and the stubble, and cast them into the burning lake. 
And with that the bottomless pit opened just whereabouts I stood, out of the mouth 
of which there came in an abundant manner smoke and coals of fire with hideous noises. 
It was also said to the same persons, Gather the wheat into my garner. And with 
that I saw many catched up and carried away into the clouds, but I was left behind. 
I also sought to hide myself, but I could not, for the man that sate upon the cloud 
still kept his eye upon me. My sins also came into my mind, and my conscience did 
accuse me on every side. I thought the day of judgment was come, and I was not ready 
for it.&quot; </p>
<p>The resting-time comes to an end. The Pilgrim gathers himself together, and proceeds 
upon his way. He is not to be burdened for ever with the sense of his sins. It fell 
from off his back at the sight of the cross. Three shining ones appear and tell 
him that his sins are forgiven; they take off his rags and provide him with a new 
suit. </p>
<p>He now encounters fellow-travellers; and the seriousness of the story is relieved 
by adventures and humorous conversations. At the bottom of a hill he finds three 
gentlemen asleep, &quot;a little out of the way.&quot; These were Simple, Sloth, and Presumption. 
He tries to rouse them, but does not succeed. Presently two others are seen tumbling 
over the wall into the Narrow Way. They are come from the land of Vain Glory, and 
are called Formalist and Hypocrisy. Like the Pilgrim, they are bound for Mount Zion; 
but the wicket-gate was &quot;too far about,&quot; and they had come by a short cut. &quot;They 
had custom for it a thousand years and more; and custom being of so long standing, 
would be admitted legal by any impartial judge.&quot; Whether right or wrong, they insist 
that they are in the way, and no more is to be said. But they are soon out of it 
again. The hill is the hill Difficulty, and the road parts into three. Two go round 
the bottom, as modern engineers would make them. The other rises straight over the 
top. Formalist and Hypocrisy choose the easy ways, and are heard of no more. Pilgrim 
climbs up, and after various accidents comes to the second resting-place, the Palace 
Beautiful, built by the Lord of the Hill to entertain strangers in. The recollections 
of Sir Bevis, of Southampton, furnished Bunyan with his framework. Lions guard the 
court. Fair ladies entertain him as if he had been a knight-errant in quest of the 
Holy Grail. The ladies, of course, are all that they ought to be: the Christian 
graces --Discretion, Prudence, Piety, and Charity. He tells them his history. They 
ask him if he has brought none of his old belongings with him. He answers Yes, but 
greatly against his will: his inward and carnal cogitations, with which his countrymen, 
as well as himself, were so much delighted. Only in golden hours they seemed to 
leave him. Who cannot recognise the truth of this? Who has not groaned over the 
follies and idiotcies that cling to us like the doggerel verses that hang about 
our memories? The room in which he sleeps is called Peace. In the morning he is 
shown the curiosities, chiefly Scripture relics, in the palace. He is taken to the 
roof, from which he sees far off the outlines of the Delectable Mountains. Next, 
the ladies carry him to the armoury, and equip him for the dangers which lie next 
before him. He is to go down into the Valley of Humiliation, and pass thence through 
the Valley of the Shadow of Death. </p>
<p>Bunyan here shows the finest insight. To some pilgrims the Valley of Humiliation 
was the pleasantest part of the journey. Mr. Feeblemind, in the second part of the 
story, was happier there than anywhere. But Christian is Bunyan himself; and Bunyan 
had a stiff, self-willed nature, and had found his spirit the most stubborn part 
of him. Down here he encounters Apollyon himself, &quot;straddling quite over the whole 
breadth of the way&quot;--a more effective devil than the Diabolus of <i>The Holy War.
</i>He fights him for half a day, is sorely wounded in head, hand, and foot, and 
has a near escape of being pressed to death. </p>
<p>Apollyon spreads his bat wings at last, and flies away; but there remains the 
Valley of the Shadow of Death, the dark scene of lonely horrors. Two men meet him 
on the borders of it. They tell him the valley is full of spectres; and they warn 
him, if he values his life, to go back. Well Bunyan knew these spectres, those dreary 
misgivings that he was toiling after an illusion; that &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; had no 
meaning except on earth, and for man&#39;s convenience; and that he himself was but 
a creature of a day, allowed a brief season of what is called existence, and then 
to pass away and be as if he had never been. It speaks well for Bunyan&#39;s honesty 
that this state of mind, which religious people generally call wicked, is placed 
directly in his Pilgrim&#39;s path, and he is compelled to pass through it. In the valley, 
close at the road-side, there is a pit, which is one of the mouths of hell. A wicked 
spirit whispers to him as he goes by. He imagines that the thought had proceeded 
out of his own heart. </p>
<p>The sky clears when he is beyond the gorge. Outside it are the caves where the 
two giants, Pope and Pagan, had lived in old times. Pagan had been dead many a day. 
Pope was still living, &quot;but he had grown so crazy and stiff in his joints that he 
could now do little more than sit in his cave&#39;s mouth, grinning at pilgrims as they 
went by, and biting his nails because he could not come at them.&quot; </p>
<p>Here he overtakes Faithful, a true pilgrim like himself. Faithful had met with 
trials; but his trials have not resembled Christian&#39;s. Christian&#39;s difficulties, 
like Bunyan&#39;s own, had been all spiritual. &quot;The lusts of the flesh&quot; seem to have 
had no attraction for him. Faithful had been assailed by Wanton, and had been obliged 
to fly from her. He had not fallen into the slough; but he had been beguiled by 
the Old Adam, who offered him one of his daughters for a wife. In the Valley of 
the Shadow of Death he had found sunshine all the way. Doubts about the truth of 
religion had never troubled the simpler nature of the good Faithful. </p>
<p>Mr. Talkative is the next character introduced, and is one of the best figures 
which Bunyan has drawn; Mr. Talkative, with Scripture at his fingers&#39; ends, and 
perfect master of all doctrinal subtleties, ready &quot;to talk of things heavenly or 
things earthly, things moral or things evangelical, things sacred or things profane, 
things past or things to come, things foreign or things at home, things essential 
or things circumstantial, provided that all be done to our profit.&quot; </p>
<p>This gentleman would have taken in Faithful, who was awed by such a rush of volubility. 
Christian has seen him before, knows him well, and can describe him. &quot;He is the 
son of one Saywell. He dwelt in Prating Row. He is for any company and for any talk. 
As he talks now with you, so will he talk when on the ale-bench. The more drink 
he hath in his crown, the more of these things he hath in his mouth. Religion hath 
no place in his heart, or home, or conversation; all that he hath lieth in his tongue, 
and his religion is to make a noise therewith.&quot; The elect, though they have ceased 
to be of the world, are still in the world. They are still part of the general community 
of mankind, and share, whether they like it or not, in the ordinary activities of 
life. Faithful and Christian have left the City of Destruction. They have shaken 
off from themselves all liking for idle pleasures. They nevertheless find themselves 
in their journey at Yanity Fair, &quot;a fair set up by Beelzebub 5000 years ago.&quot; Trade 
of all sorts went on at Vanity Fair, and people of all sorts were collected there: 
cheats, fools, asses, knaves, and rogues. Some were honest, many were dishonest; 
some lived peaceably and uprightly, others robbed, murdered, seduced their neighbours&#39; 
wives, or lied and perjured themselves. Vanity Fair was European society as it existed 
in the days of Charles II. Each nation was represented. There was British Row, French 
Row, and Spanish Row. &quot;The wares of Rome and her merchandise were greatly promoted 
at the fair, only the English nation, with some others, had taken a dislike to them.&quot; 
The pilgrims appear on the scene as the Apostles appeared at Antioch and Rome, to 
tell the people that there were things in the world of more consequence than money 
and pleasure. The better sort listen. Public opinion in general calls them fools 
and Bedlamites. The fair becomes excited, disturbances are feared, and the authorities 
send to make inquiries. Authorities naturally disapprove of novelties; and Christian 
and Faithful are arrested, beaten, and put in the cage. Their friends insist that 
they have done no harm, that they are innocent strangers teaching only what will 
make men better instead of worse. A riot follows. The authorities determine to make 
an example of them, and the result is the ever-memorable trial of the two pilgrims. 
They are brought in irons before my Lord Hate-good, charged with &quot;disturbing the 
trade of the town, creating divisions, and making converts to their opinions in 
contempt of the law of the Prince.&quot; </p>
<p>Faithful begins with an admission which would have made it difficult for Hategood 
to let him off, for he says that the Prince they talked of, being Beelzebub, the 
enemy of the Lord, he defied him and all his angels. Three witnesses were then called: 
Envy, Superstition, and Pick-thank. </p>
<p>Envy says that Faithful regards neither prince nor people, but does all he can 
to possess men with disloyal notions, which he calls principles of faith and holiness.
</p>
<p>Superstition says that he knows little of him, but has heard him say that &quot;our 
religion is naught, and such by which no man can please God, from which saying his 
Lordship well knows will follow that we are yet in our sins, and finally shall be 
damned.&quot; </p>
<p>Pickthank deposes that he has heard Faithful rail on Beelzebub, and speak contemptuously 
of his honourable friends my Lord Old Man, my Lord Carnal Delight, my Lord Luxurious, 
my Lord Desire of Vain Glory, my Lord Lechery, Sir Having Greedy, and the rest of 
the nobility, besides which he has railed against his lordship on the bench himself, 
calling him an ungodly villain. </p>
<p>The evidence was perfectly true, and the prisoner, when called on for his defence, 
confirmed it. He says (avoiding the terms in which he was said to rail, and the 
like) that &quot;the Prince of the town, with all the rabblement of his attendants by 
this gentleman named, are more fit for a being in hell than in this town or country.&quot;
</p>
<p>Lord Hategood has been supposed to have been drawn from one or other of Charles 
II.&#39;s judges, perhaps from either Twisden or Chester, who had the conversation with 
Bunyan&#39;s wife. But it is difficult to see how either one or the other could have 
acted otherwise than they did. Faithful might be quite right. Hell might be, and 
probably was, the proper place for Beelzebub, and for all persons holding authority 
under him. But as a matter of fact, a form of society did for some purpose or other 
exist, and had been permitted to exist for 5000 years, owning Beelzebub&#39;s sovereignty. 
It must defend itself, or must cease to be, and it could not be expected to make 
no effort at self-preservation. Faithful had come to Vanity Fair to make a revolution--a 
revolution extremely desirable, but one which it was unreasonable to expect the 
constituted authorities to allow to go forward. It was not a case of false witness. 
A prisoner who admits that he has taught the people that their Prince ought to be 
in hell, and has called the judge an ungodly villain, cannot complain if he is accused 
of preaching rebellion. </p>
<p>Lord Hategood charges the jury, and explains the law. &quot;There was an Act made,&quot; 
he says, &quot;in the days of Pharaoh the Great, servant to our Prince, that lest those 
of a contrary religion should multiply and grow too strong for him, their males 
should be thrown into the river. There was also an Act made in the days of Nebuchadnezzar 
the Great, that whoever would not fall down and worship his golden image should 
be thrown into a fiery furnace. There was also an Act made in the days of Darius 
that whoso for some time called upon any God but him should be cast into the lion&#39;s 
den. Now the substance of these laws this rebel hath broken, not only in thought 
(which is not to be borne), but also in word and deed, which must, therefore, be 
intolerable. For that of Pharaoh, his law was made upon a supposition to prevent 
mischief, no crime being yet apparent. For the second and third you see his disputations 
against our religion, and for the treason he hath confessed he deserveth to die 
the death.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Then went the jury out, whose names were Mr. Blind-man, Mr. Nogood, Mr. Malice, 
Mr. Lovelust, Mr. Liveloose, Mr. Heady, Mr. Highmind, Mr. Enmity, Mr. Liar, Mr. 
Cruelty, Mr. Hatelight, and Mr. Implacable, who every one gave in his private verdict 
against him among themselves, and afterwards unanimously concluded to bring him 
in guilty before the judge. And first, Mr.<b> </b>Blindman, the foreman, said: I 
see clearly that this man is a heretic. Then said Mr. Nogood, Away with such a fellow 
from the earth. Aye, said Mr. Malice, I hate the very looks of him. Then said Mr. 
Lovelust, I could never endure him. Nor I, said Mr. Liveloose, for he would always 
be condemning my way. Hang him, hang him, said Mr. Heady. A sorry scrub, said Mr. 
Highmind. My heart riseth against him, said Mr. Enmity. He is a rogue, said Mr. 
Liar. Hanging is too good for him, said Mr. Cruelty. Let us despatch him out of 
the way, said Mr. Hatelight. Then, said Mr. Implacable, might I have all the world 
given me, I could not be reconciled to him; therefore, let us forthwith bring him 
in guilty of death.&quot; </p>
<p>Abstract qualities of character were never clothed in more substantial flesh 
and blood than these jurymen. Spenser&#39;s knights in the <i>Fairy Queen </i>are mere 
shadows to them. Faithful was, of course, condemned, scourged, buffeted, lanced 
in his feet with knives, stoned, stabbed, at last burned, and spared the pain of 
travelling further on the narrow road. A chariot and horses were waiting to bear 
him through the clouds, the nearest way to the Celestial Gate. Christian, who it 
seems had been remanded, contrives to escape. He is joined by Hopeful, a convert 
whom he has made in the town, and they pursue their journey in company. A second 
person is useful dramatically, and Hopeful takes Faithful&#39;s place. Leaving Vanity 
Fair, they are again on the Pilgrim&#39;s road. There they encounter Mr. Bye-ends. Bye-ends 
comes from the town of Plain-Speech, where he has a large kindred, My Lord Turnabout, 
my Lord Timeserver, Mr. Facing-both-ways, Mr. Two Tongues, the parson of the parish. 
Bye-ends himself was married to a daughter of Lady Feignings. Bunyan&#39;s invention 
in such things was inexhaustible. </p>
<p>They have more trials of the old kind with which Bunyan himself was so familiar. 
They cross the River of Life and even drink at it, yet for all this, and directly 
after, they stray into Bye-path Meadow. They lose themselves in the grounds of Doubting 
Castle, and are seized upon by Giant Despair--still a prey to doubt--still uncertain 
whether religion be not a dream, even after they have fought with wild beasts in 
Vanity Fair and have drunk of the water of life. Nowhere does Bunyan show better 
how well he knew the heart of man. Christian even thinks of killing himself in the 
dungeons of Doubting Castle. Hopeful cheers him up; they break their prison, recover 
the road again, and arrive at the Delectable Mountains in Emmanuel&#39;s own land. There 
it might be thought the danger would be over, but it is not so. Even in Emmanuel&#39;s 
Land there is a door in the side of a hill which is a byeway to hell, and beyond 
Emmanuel&#39;s Land is the country of conceit, a new and special temptation for those 
who think that they are near salvation. Here they encounter &quot;a brisk lad of the 
neighbourhood,&quot; needed soon after for a particular purpose, who is a good liver, 
prays devoutly, fasts regularly, pays tithes punctually, and hopes that everyone 
will get to heaven by the religion which he professes, provided he fears God and 
tries to do his duty. The name of this brisk lad is Ignorance. Leaving him, they 
are caught in a net by Flatterer, and are smartly whipped by &quot;a shining one,&quot; who 
lets them out of it. False ideas and vanity lay them open once more to their most 
dangerous enemy. They meet a man coming toward them from the direction in which 
they are going. They tell him that they are on the way to Mount Zion. He laughs 
scornfully, and answers:-- </p>
<p>&quot;There is no such place as you dream of in all the world. When I was at home 
in ray own country, I heard as you now affirm, and from hearing I went out to see; 
and have been seeking this city these twenty years, but I find no more of it than 
I did the first day I went out. I am going back again, and will seek to refresh 
myself with. things which I then cast away for hopes of that which I now see is 
not.&quot; </p>
<p>Still uncertainty--even on the verge of eternity-- strange, doubtless, and reprehensible 
to Right Eeverend persons, who never &quot;cast away&quot; anything; to whom a religious profession 
has been a highway to pleasure and preferment, who live in the comfortable assurance 
that as it has been in this life so it will be in the next. Only moral obliquity 
of the worst kind could admit a doubt about so excellent a religion as this. But 
Bunyan was not a Right Reverend. Christianity had brought him no palaces and large 
revenues, and a place among the great of the land. If Christianity was not true, 
his whole life was folly and illusion, and the dread that it might be so clung to 
his belief like its shadow. </p>
<p>The way was still long. The pilgrims reach the Enchanted Ground, and are drowsy 
and tired. Ignorance comes up with them again. He talks much about himself. He tells 
them of the good motives that come into his mind and comfort him as he walks. His 
heart tells him that he has left all for God and heaven. His belief and his life 
agree together, and he is humbly confident that his hopes are well-founded. When 
they speak to him of Salvation by Faith and Conviction by Sin, he cannot understand 
what they mean. As he leaves them they are reminded of one Temporary, &quot;once a forward 
man in religion.&quot; Temporary dwelt in Graceless, &quot;a town two miles from Honesty, 
next door to one Turnback.&quot; He &quot;was going on pilgrimage, but became acquainted with 
one Save Self, and was never more heard of.&quot; </p>
<p>These figures all mean something. They correspond in part to Bunyan&#39;s own recollection 
of his own trials. Partly he is indulging his humour by describing others who were 
more astray than he was. It was over at last: the pilgrims arrive at the land of 
Beulah, the beautiful sunset after the storms were all past. Doubting Castle can 
be seen no more, and between them and their last rest there remains only the deep 
river over which there is no bridge, the river of Death. On the hill beyond the 
waters glitter the towers and domes of the Celestial City; but through the river 
they must first pass, and they find it deeper or shallower according to the strength 
of their faith. They go through, Hopeful feeling the bottom all along; Christian 
still in character, not without some horror, and frightened by hobgoblins. On the 
other side they are received by angels, and are carried to their final home, to 
live for ever in the Prince&#39;s presence. Then follows the only passage which the 
present writer reads with regret in this admirable book. It is given to the self-righteous 
Ignorance, who, doubtless, had been provoking with &quot;his good motives that comforted 
him as he walked;&quot; but Bunyan&#39;s zeal might have been satisfied by inflicting a lighter 
chastisement upon him. He comes up to the river: he crosses without the difficulties 
which attended Christian and Hopeful. &quot;It happened that there was then at the place 
one Vain Hope, a Ferryman, that with his boat&quot; (some viaticum or priestly absolution) 
&quot;helped him over.&quot; He ascends the hill, and approaches the city, but no angels are 
in attendance, &quot;neither did any man meet him with the least encouragement.&quot; Above 
the gate there was the verse written--&quot;Blessed are they that do His commandments, 
that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the gate 
into the city.&quot; Bunyan, who believed that no man could keep the commandments, and 
had no right to anything but damnation, must have introduced the words as if to 
mock the unhappy wretch who, after all, had tried to keep the commandments as well 
as most people, and was seeking admittance, with a conscience moderately at ease. 
&quot;He was asked by the men that looked over the gate--Whence come you, and what would 
you have?&quot; He answered, &quot;I have eaten and drunk in the presence of the King, and 
he has taught in our street.&quot; Then they asked him for his certificate, that they 
might go in and show it to the king. So he fumbled in his bosom for one, and found 
none. Then said they, &quot;Have you none?&quot; But the man answered never a word. So they 
told the king; but he would not come down to see him, but commanded the two shining 
ones that conducted Christian and Hopeful to the city, to go out and take Ignorance 
and bind him hand and foot, and have him away. Then they took him up and carried 
him through the air to the door in the side of the hill, and put him in there. &quot;Then,&quot; 
so Bunyan ends, &quot;I saw that there was a way to hell even from the gates of heaven, 
as well as from the City of Destruction; so I awoke, and behold it was a dream!&quot;
</p>
<p>Poor Ignorance! Hell--such a place as Bunyan imagined hell to be--was a hard fate 
for a miserable mortal who had failed to comprehend the true conditions of justification. 
We are not told that he was a vain boaster. He could not have advanced so near to 
the door of heaven if he had not been really a decent man, though vain and silly. 
Behold, it was a dream! The dreams which come to us when sleep is deep on the soul 
may be sent direct from some revealing power. When we are near waking, the supernatural 
insight may be refracted through human theory. </p>
<p>Charity will hope that the vision of Ignorance cast bound into the mouth of hell, 
when he was knocking at the gate of heaven, came through Homer&#39;s ivory gate, and 
that Banyan here was a mistaken interpreter of the spiritual tradition. The fierce 
inferences of Puritan theology are no longer credible to us; yet nobler men than 
the Puritans are not to be found in all English history. It will be well if the 
clearer sight which enables us to detect their errors enables us also to recognise 
their excellence. </p>
<p>The second part of <i>The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress, </i>like most second parts, is 
but a feeble reverberation of the first. It is comforting, no doubt, to know that 
Christian&#39;s wife and children were not left to their fate in the City of Destruction. 
But Bunyan had given us all that he had to tell about the journey, and we do not 
need a repetition of it. Of course there are touches of genius. No writing of Bunyan&#39;s 
could be wholly without it. But the rough simplicity is gone, and instead of it 
there is a tone of sentiment which is almost mawkish. Giants, dragons, and angelic 
champions carry us into a spurious fairy-land, where the knight-errant is a preacher 
in disguise. Fair ladies and love matches, however decorously chastened, suit ill 
with the sternness of the moral conflict between the soul and sin. Christiana and 
her children are tolerated for the pilgrim&#39;s sake to whom they belong. Had they 
appealed to our interest on their own merits, we would have been contented to wish 
them well through their difficulties, and to trouble ourselves no further about 
them. </p>
