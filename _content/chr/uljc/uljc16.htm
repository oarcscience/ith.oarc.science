<p>1. When the priests and the elders heard Issa, they decided among themselves not to give judgment against him, for he had done no harm to any one, and, presenting themselves before Pilate--who was made Governor of Jerusalem by the Pagan king of the country of Romeles--they spake to him thus:</p>  
<p>2. "We have seen the man whom thou chargest with inciting our people to revolt; we have heard his discourses and know that he is our countryman;</p>  
<p>3. "But the chiefs of the cities have made to you false reports, for he is a just man, who</p>  
<p><a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="green">p. 199</font></A></p>  
<p>teaches the people the word of God. After interrogating him, we have allowed him to go in peace."</p>  
<p>4. The governor thereupon became very angry, and sent his disguised spies to keep watch upon Issa and report to the authorities the least word he addressed to the people.</p>  
<p>5. In the meantime, the holy Issa continued to visit the neighboring cities and preach the true way of the Lord, enjoining the Hebrews patience and promising them speedy deliverance.</p>  
<p>6. And all the time great numbers of the people followed him wherever he went, and many did not leave him at all, but attached themselves to him and served him.</p>  
<p>7. And Issa said: "Put not your faith in miracles performed by the hands of men, for He who rules nature is alone capable of doing</p>  
<p><a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="green">p. 200</font></A></p>  
<p>supernatural things, while man is impotent to arrest the wrath of the winds or cause the rain to fall.</p>  
<p>8. "One miracle, however, is within the power of man to accomplish. It is, when his heart is filled with sincere faith, he resolves to root out from his mind all evil promptings and desires, and when, in order to attain this end, he ceases to walk the path of iniquity.</p>  
<p>9. "All the things done without God are only gross errors, illusions and seductions, serving but to show how much the heart of the doer is full of presumption, falsehood and impurity.</p>  
<p>10. "Put not your faith in oracles. God alone knows the future. He who has recourse to the diviners soils the temple of his heart and shows his lack of faith in his Creator.</p>  
<p><a name="page_201"><font size="1" color="green">p. 201</font></A></p>  
<p>11. "Belief in the diviners and their miracles destroys the innate simplicity of man and his childlike purity. An infernal power takes hold of him who so errs, and forces him to commit various sins and give himself to the worship of idols.</p>  
<p>12. "But the Lord our God, to whom none can be equalled, is one omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent; He alone possesses all wisdom and all light.</p>  
<p>13. "To Him ye must address yourselves, to be comforted in your afflictions, aided in your works, healed in your sickness and whoso asks of Him, shall not ask in vain.</p>  
<p>14. "The secrets of nature are in the hands of God, for the whole world, before it was made manifest, existed in the bosom of the divine thought, and has become material and visible by the will of the Most High.</p>  
<p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="green">p. 202</font></A></p>  
<p>15. "When ye pray to him, become again like little children, for ye know neither the past, nor the present, nor the future, and God is the Lord of Time."</p>
