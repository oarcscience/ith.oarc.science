OF THE CREATION OF THE SEVEN NATURES (SUBSTANCES) IN SILENCE.

   W<span class="small">HEN</span> God in His mercy wished to make known
all His power and His wisdom, in the beginning, on the evening of the
first day, which is Sunday, He created seven natures (substances) in
silence, without voice. And because there was as yet none to hear a
sound, He did well to create them in silence, that He might not make
anything uselessly; but He willed, and heaven, earth, water, air, fire,
and the angels and darkness, came into being from nothing.
