# CHAPTER VIII<span id="page_12_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_12_note_6).

OF THE FIRMAMENT .

   O<span class="small">N</span> the evening of the second day of the
week, God willed to divide the heavens from the earth, that there might
be luminaries and stars beneath the heavens to give light to this world,
and that the heavens might be a dwelling-place for the righteous and the
angels after the <span id="page_13">p. 13</span> resurrection. God said,
'Let there be a firmament which shall divide the waters from the
waters<span id="page_13_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_13_note_1)'; and straightway the
waters were divided into three parts. One part remained upon the earth
for the use of men, cattle, winged fowl--the rivers and the seas; of
another part God made the firmament; and the third part He took up above
the firmament. But on the day of resurrection the waters will return to
their former nature.
