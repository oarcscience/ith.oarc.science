<A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A>

apostles had received the gift of the Holy Spirit, on the day following they fasted this feast of the apostles (which we keep)<A NAME="page_104_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_104_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>; but the Malk&acirc;y&ecirc; (Melchites)<A NAME="page_104_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_104_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> say that the apostles fasted eight days after. Their names are as follows.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon, the chief of the apostles, was from Bethsaida, of the tribe of Naphtali. He first preached in Antioch, and built there the first of all churches, which was in the house of Cassianus, whose son he restored to life. He remained there one year, and there the disciples were called Christians. From thence he went to Rome, where he remained for twenty-seven years; and in the three hundred and seventy-sixth year of the Greeks, the wicked Nero crucified him head downwards.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew his brother preached in Scythia and Nicomedia and Achaia. He built a church in Byzantium, and there he died and was buried.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John the son of Zebedee (Zabhdai) was also from Bethsaida, of the tribe of Zebulun. He first preached in Asia (Ephesus), and was afterwards cast into exile in the island of Patmos by Tiberius Caesar. He then went to Ephesus, and built in it a church. Three of his disciples went with him: Ignatius, who was afterwards bishop of Antioch, and who was thrown to the beasts in Rome; Polycarp, who was afterwards bishop of Smyrna, and was crowned by fire; and John, to whom he committed the priesthood and the bishopric after him. When John had lived a long time, he died and was buried at Ephesus; and John, the

<A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A>

disciple of the Evangelist, who became bishop of Ephesus, buried him<A NAME="page_105_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_105_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>; for he commanded them that no one should know the place of his burial. The graves of both of them are in Ephesus; the hidden one of the Evangelist, and the other of his disciple John, the author of the Revelation; he said that everything he had written down, he had heard from John the Evangelist.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James, the brother of John, preached in his city Bethsaida, and built a church there. Herod Agrippas slew him with the sword one year after the Ascension of our Lord. He was laid in &Acirc;<U>k</U>&acirc;r, a city of Marm&acirc;r&icirc;<U>k</U>&acirc;<A NAME="page_105_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_105_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philip also was from Bethsaida, of the tribe of Asher. He preached in Phrygia, Pamphylia and Pisidia; he built a church in Pisidia, and died and was buried there. He lived twenty-seven years as an apostle<A NAME="page_105_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_105_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas was from Jerusalem, of the tribe of Judah. He taught the Parthians, Medes and Indians<A NAME="page_105_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_105_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A>; and because he baptised the daughter of the king of the Indians, he stabbed him with a spear and he died<A NAME="page_105_fr_5"></A><A HREF="#page_105_note_5"><SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP></A>. <U>H</U>abb&acirc;n the merchant brought his body, and laid it in Edessa, the blessed city of Christ our Lord<A NAME="page_105_fr_6"></A><A HREF="#page_105_note_6"><SUP><SMALL>6</SMALL></SUP></A>.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judas Iscariot, the betrayer, was from the town of S<U>e</U>khary&ucirc;<U>t</U> of the tribe of Gad, though some say that he was of the tribe of Dan. He was like unto the serpent that acts deceitfully towards its master, because like a serpent, he dealt craftily with his Lord. Matthias, of the tribe of Reuben, came in in his stead. He preached in Hellas, and in Sicily, where he built a church, and died and was buried in it<A NAME="page_107_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_107_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While James the brother of our Lord was teaching the Jews in Jerusalem, they cast him down from a pinnacle of the temple; and while his life was yet in him, a fuller of cloth smote him upon the head with a club and beat it in; and afterwards they stoned him with stones<A NAME="page_107_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_107_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John the Baptist was of the tribe of Levi. Herod the tetrarch slew him, and his body was laid in Sebastia.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ananias (<U>H</U>anany&acirc;) the disciple of the Baptist taught in Damascus and Arb&ecirc;l<A NAME="page_107_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_107_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A>. He was slain by P&ocirc;l, the general of the army of Aretas<A NAME="page_107_fr_5"></A><A HREF="#page_107_note_5"><SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP></A>, and was laid in the church which he built at Arb&ecirc;l (Irbil).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul of Tarsus was a Pharisee by sect, of the tribe of Ephraim<A NAME="page_107_fr_6"></A><A HREF="#page_107_note_6"><SUP><SMALL>6</SMALL></SUP></A>. When he had been baptised by Ananias, he wrought many miracles, and taught great cities, and bore and suffered dangers not a few for the name of Christ. Afterwards he went to Peter at Rome. When they divided the world between them, and the heathen fell to Paul's lot, and the Jewish nation to Peter, and they had turned<A NAME="page_107_fr_7"></A><A HREF="#page_107_note_7"><SUP><SMALL>7</SMALL></SUP></A> many to the truth of Christ, Nero commanded that they should both die a cruel death. Then Simon asked to be crucified head downwards, that he might kiss that part of the cross where the heels

of his Master had been. As they were going forth to be slain, they gave the laying on of hands of the priesthood to their disciples, Peter to Mark, and Paul to Luke. When Peter had been crucified, and Paul slain, together with many of those who had become their disciples, Mark and Luke went forth by night, and brought their bodies into the city. Now Paul's head was lost among the slain, and could not be found. Some time after, when a shepherd was passing by the spot where the slain were buried, he found Paul's head, and took it upon the top of his staff, and laid it by his sheep-fold. At night he saw a fire blazing over it, and he went in (to the city) and informed the holy bishop Xystus (Sixtus) and the clergy of the church; and they all recognised that it was Paul's head. Xystus said to them, 'Let us watch and pray the whole night, and let us bring out the body and lay the head at its feet; and if it joins again to its neck, it will be certain that it is Paul's.' And when they had done so, the whole body was restored, and the head was joined to its neck as if the vertebrae had never been severed; and those who saw it were amazed and glorified God. From his call to the end of his life was thirty-five years; he went about in every place for thirty-one years; for two years he was in prison at Caesarea, and for two years at Rome. He was martyred in the thirty-sixth year after the Passion of our Lord, and was laid with great honour in the magnificent royal catacombs in Rome. They celebrate every year the day of his commemoration on the twenty-ninth of the month of Tamm&ucirc;z<A NAME="page_108_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_108_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>.</P>

He was crowned with the sword by <U>H</U>&ocirc;ros<A NAME="page_108_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_108_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A>, the judge (or governor) of the emperor Tiberius, while he was preaching in Alexandria, and was buried there.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addai was from Paneas, and he preached in Edessa and in Mesopotamia in the days of Abgar the king; and he built a church in Edessa. After Abgar died, Herod<A NAME="page_109_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_109_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> Abgar's son slew him in the fortress of Agg&ecirc;l<A NAME="page_109_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_109_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A>. His body was afterwards taken and carried to Rome; but some say that he was laid in Edessa.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aggai his disciple was first of all a maker of silks for Abgar, and became a disciple. After Abgar's death, his son reigned, and he required of Aggai to weave silks for him; and when he consented not, saying, 'I cannot forsake teaching and preaching to return to weaving,' he smote him with a club upon his legs and brake them, and he died<A NAME="page_109_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_109_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thaddaeus (Taddai) came after him at Edessa, and Herod, the son of Abgar, slew him also; he was buried at Edessa.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zacchaeus (Zaccai) the publican<A NAME="page_109_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_109_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A> and the young man whom our Lord brought to life were both slain together while they were preaching in Mount <U>H</U>&ocirc;r&ocirc;n.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jews smote Simon the leper while he was teaching in Ramah, and he died (there).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph the Senator taught in Galilee and Decapolis; he was buried in his town of Ramah.</P>
