# CHAPTER XI<span id="page_14_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_14_note_4).

OF THE CREATION OF SEA-MONSTERS, FISH, WINGED FOWL, AND THE REPTILES
THAT ARE IN THE SEAS.

   O<span class="small">N</span> the fifth day of the week God made from
the waters mighty sea-monsters<span id="page_14_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_14_note_5), fish, winged fowl,
swimming beasts, and the reptiles that are in the seas. He created the
winged fowl that are in the waters from the waters; for, like fish, they
lay eggs and swim. Now, fish swim in the waters, and winged fowl in the
air; but some of the latter <span id="page_15">p. 15</span> in the
waters also. Although they say that swimming creatures were made from
the waters, or that the other wild beasts and cattle were made from the
earth; still they consist of parts of all the other elements. Those,
however, that are of the waters, have the greater part of their
composition made of water; while the greater part of those whose origin
is earth, consists of earth: but none of them lack the four elements.
