  <h2 align="center">THE CONDITIONS OF A DEEPENING PERSONAL RELATION</h2>

  <p>It is perhaps still more obvious that, if the relation to God is a personal relation at all, the laws of the
  spiritual life must be primarily the laws of a deepening personal relation; and that, wherever any soul is ignoring
  such a deepening relation with God and with men, he is making it inevitable that the spiritual life should seem to
  him unreal, and that he should have no sense of growth and achievement in it. To state, then, simply, the conditions
  upon which a personal relation with God and with men would deepen, would be to state the fundamental laws of the
  spiritual life. If one is ignoring these laws, he need not wonder that the spiritual world is for him obscure.</p>

  <p>It is not difficult to summarize, at least suggestively, what these conditions of any deepening personal relation
  must be; for it is plain that every friendship worthy the name must build upon mutual self-revelation and answering
  trust, mutual self-giving, and some deep community of interests. If we are not laying this foundation in our
  relations to God and to men, we are naturally making it impossible that there should be reality and depth in the
  relations involved in our religious life. One needs, this means, to put himself honestly face to face with God&#39;s
  great self-revelation in Christ, to give himself in real ethical activity in this relation, and to seek the great
  interests of the kingdom of God that lie at God&#39;s own heart. Only so is a real basis laid for steady growth into
  the divine friendship.</p>

  <p>And when one asks how in any personal relation he may go forward to build upon this foundation, exactly the same
  suggestions, that may be made concerning any human relation, will be found to bear directly upon growth into the life
  with God. We must, for example, count upon unconscious growth here rather than conscious arrangement. We may not
  expect continuous emotion, but must rely mainly upon steady association with the life of Christ. We shall see that
  this personal relation, like any other, will grow naturally by the expression of it in the various ways possible to
  us, and we shall be sure to be genuine throughout.</p>

  <p>That is, in a word, this whole analogy of the religious life to a personal relation suggests definite and deep,
  but yet simple, conditions that we may know and fulfil, and, in the fulfilment of them, be able to count upon
  results. But this must mean, also, that, where these plain conditions of a deepening personal relation are ignored,
  the spiritual life cannot be real or significant.</p>

  <p>When we pass to the consideration of the differences between the conditions of the religious life and those of any
  other deepening personal relation, we are led here, too, to see that, just because this conception of the religious
  life as a personal relation has such deep significance, it is the more necessary that we should not unwarrantably
  transfer to the relation to God those limitations which, because of our very finiteness, hold in the relation of
  finite to finite. We are, then, carefully to guard the conception, making it clear to ourselves that we are seeking a
  relation to a God who has concretely and objectively revealed himself in Christ; and that we are not, therefore, to
  enter upon the experiment of simply building up a subjective experience of our own.</p>

  <p>Not less are we to remember that we cannot, of course, expect a sensuous relation to God like that which
  accompanies, rather than constitutes, our true spiritual relation to other persons. Nor should this analogy mean that
  there is to be any failure in the deepest reverence; in claiming this personal relation to God we do not, and we may
  not, put ourselves upon familiar equality with God. And we shall especially remember that the relation to God, just
  because of what God is, must have a universality all its own. Since God is the God of perfect righteousness and life,
  and is himself the source of the moral constitution of men, the relation to him cannot be conceived sentimentally,
  but naturally carries with it our relations to all other personalities. The relation to God is that one relation
  which, itself set right, sets all other relations right. And there can be, therefore, no such thing as a growing
  religious life that does not mean at the same time a life of increasing faithfulness in all our human relations.</p>
