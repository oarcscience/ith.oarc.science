### CHAPTER VII

### ERRORS IN THE ROMAN TRIALS

Mr. Rollins <span id="fr_97"></span>[97](#fn_97) says Rome had "nothing
to do with the arrest of Christ other than to furnish the soldiers to
accompany the accusers" and then goes on in a homiletical style, to
review the public career of Jesus as a background for the tria1, <span
id="fr_98"></span>[98](#fn_98) and after a brief discussion of the
Sanhedrists and their actions, <span id="fr_99"></span>[99](#fn_99)
devotes the remainder of his book <span
id="fr_100"></span>[100](#fn_100) to a discussion of Pilate, Herod and
Pilate's wife, in narrative fashion and without citation of authorities.
Mr. Chandler <span id="fr_101"></span>[101](#fn_101) devotes
considerable space to extraneous discussions of Roman Law and Procedure
and concludes that while Pilate commenced the hearings in proper dignity
and reached an opinion that would result in an acquittal, he
[vacillated](errata.htm#4) into compliance with the wishes of the Jewish
mob. We confine ourselves to

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

technicality as to the issues involved, and refer the reader to Chandler
for a more abstract discussion of Roman Jurisprudence.

There are two documents in ancient Roman Law that are basic, The Laws of
The Twelve Tables <span id="fr_102"></span>[102](#fn_102) and the Code
of Justinian. <span id="fr_103"></span>[103](#fn_103) We need concern
ourselves only with the former to convict Pilate of legal error in his
treatment of Jesus. <span id="fr_104"></span>[104](#fn_104) We will cite
table and sentence from the Twelve Tables as we have cited Chapter and
Verse from The Bible.

The Gospels give the Roman trial considerable mention, <span
id="fr_105"></span>[105](#fn_105) and yet only a few statements are made
which we need examine in order to establish that Roman government was
supreme over the Sanhedrists and that Christ "was condemned to death in
the reign of Tiberius by the Procurator Pontius Pilate." <span
id="fr_106"></span>[106](#fn_106)

Now—What does the record show and wherein did Pilate err?

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

1\. Pilate did not hold hearing until dawn, <span
id="fr_107"></span>[107](#fn_107) but some say he should have compelled
the Sanhedrin to obey the Jewish and Roman law against night
trials. <span id="fr_108"></span>[108](#fn_108)

2\. Pilate erred in permitting the Sanhedrists to examine Jesus in
private <span id="fr_109"></span>[109](#fn_109) when trials had to be
public in those days <span id="fr_110"></span>[110](#fn_110) as
now. <span id="fr_111"></span>[111](#fn_111)

3\. Pilate erred in not requiring the testimony of witnesses, Roman Law
agreeing with the Jewish and our law on this point. <span
id="fr_112"></span>[112](#fn_112)

4\. Pilate should have released Jesus when he found "no harm" in
Him. <span id="fr_113"></span>[113](#fn_113) On this point the Law of
the Twelve Tables is crystal clear. Archeologists have not found all of
the stone fragments of The Twelve Tables, but Professor Conant explains
that all have been collated by Bruns from other sources and

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Conant translates
as Table IX, verse 6, "The decrees of the Twelve Tables forbid any
uncondemned man whomever be put to death." <span
id="fr_114"></span>[114](#fn_114) All of the best writers agree that
Pilate, finding no harm in Jesus, should have released him then and
there. <span id="fr_115"></span>[115](#fn_115)
