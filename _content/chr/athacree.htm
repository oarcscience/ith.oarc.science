<H1>Athanasian Creed</H1>
<hr> 
<p>1.  Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary 
that he hold the catholic faith; 
<p>2.  Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled,
without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.  
<p>3.  And the catholic faith is this: That we worship one God in 
Trinity, and Trinity in Unity;
<p>4.  Neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance.
<p>5.  For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and
another of the Holy Spirit.  
<p>6.  But the Godhead of the Father, of
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is all one, the glory equal, the majesty
coeternal.  
<p>7.  Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is
the Holy Spirit.  
<p>8.  The Father uncreated, the Son uncreated, and the
Holy Spirit uncreated.  
<p>9.  The Father incomprehensible, the Son
incomprehensible, and the Holy Spirit incomprehensible.  
<p>10.  The
Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Spirit eternal.  
<p>11.
And yet they are not three eternals but one eternal.  
<p>12.  As also
there are not three uncreated nor three incomprehensible, but one
uncreated and one incomprehensible.  
<p>13.  So likewise the Father is
almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Spirit almighty.  
<p>14.  And
yet they are not three almighties, but one almighty.  
<p>15.  So the
Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God; 
<p>16.  And
yet they are not three Gods, but one God.  
<p>17.  So likewise the
Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Spirit Lord; 
<p>18.  And yet
they are not three Lords but one Lord.  
<p>19.  For like as we are
compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every Person by himself
to be God and Lord; 
<p>20.  So are we forbidden by the catholic religion
to say; There are three Gods or three Lords.  
<p>21.  The Father is made
of none, neither created nor begotten.  
<p>22.  The Son is of the Father
alone; not made nor created, but begotten.  
<p>23.  The Holy Spirit is
of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten,
but proceeding.  
<p>24.  So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one
Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits.  
<p>25.
And in this Trinity none is afore or after another; none is greater or
less than another.  
<p>26.  But the whole three persons are coeternal,
and coequal.  
<p>27.  So that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in
Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.  
<p>28.  He
therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity.  
<p>29.
Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also
believe rightly the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
<p>30.  For
the right faith is that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, is God and man.  
<p>31.  God of the substance of
the Father, begotten before the worlds; and man of substance of His
mother, born in the world.  
<p>32.  Perfect God and perfect man, of a
reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting.  
<p>33.  Equal to the Father
as touching His Godhead, and inferior to the Father as touching His
manhood.  
<p>34.  Who, although He is God and man, yet He is not two,
but one Christ.  
<p>35.  One, not by conversion of the Godhead into
flesh, but by taking of that manhood into God.  
<p>36.  One altogether,
not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person.  
<p>37.  For as
the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ;

<p>38.  Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose again
the third day from the dead; 
<p>39.  He ascended into heaven, He sits on
the right hand of the Father, God, Almighty; 
<p>40.  From thence He
shall come to judge the quick and the dead.  
<p>41.  At whose coming all
men shall rise again with their bodies; 
<p>42.  and shall give account
of their own works.  
<p>43.  And they that have done good shall go into
life everlasting and they that have done evil into everlasting fire.

<p>44.  This is the catholic faith, which except a man believe
faithfully he cannot be saved.  </BODY></HTML>
