### OF THE TRANSFIGURATION OF CHRIST

St. Matthew writes in the seventeenth Chapter \[1-14\].

**First Point.** First: Taking along His beloved Disciples, Peter,
James, John, Christ our Lord was transfigured, and His face did shine as
the sun, and His garments as the snow.

**Second Point.** Second: He was speaking with Moses and Elias.

**Third Point.** Third: St. Peter saying that they would make three
tabernacles, a voice from heaven sounded, which said: "\`This is My
beloved Son, hear ye Him!'" When His Disciples heard this voice, they
fell for fear on their faces; and Christ our Lord touched them and said
to them: "\` Arise and fear not. Tell this vision to no one until the
Son of Man be risen.'"
