### OF THE MYSTERIES DONE FROM THE HOUSE OF ANNAS TO THE HOUSE OF CAIPHAS, INCLUSIVE

**First Point.** First: They take Him bound from the house of Annas to
the house of Caiphas, where St. Peter denied Him twice, and looked at by
the Lord, going forth he wept bitterly.

**Second Point.** Second: Jesus was all that night bound.

**Third Point.** Third: Besides, those who held Him captive mocked Him
and struck Him and covered His face and gave Him buffets and asked Him:
"\`Prophesy to us, who is he that struck Thee?'" and like things,
blaspheming against Him.
