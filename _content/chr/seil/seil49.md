### OF THE COMING OF CHRIST TO THE TEMPLE WHEN HE WAS OF THE AGE OF TWELVE YEARS

St. Luke writes in the second Chapter \[42-51\].

**First Point**. First: Christ our Lord, of the age of twelve years,
went up from Nazareth to Jerusalem.

**Second Point**. Second: Christ our Lord remained in Jerusalem, and His
parents did not know it.

**Third Point**. Third: The three days passed, they found Him disputing
in the Temple, and seated in the midst of the doctors, and His parents
asking Him where He had been, He answered: "\`Did you not know that it
behooves Me to be in the things which are My Father's?'"
