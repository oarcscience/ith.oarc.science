<p> <b>First Point.</b> First: The Lord sends for the ass and the foal, saying: "Loose them and bring them to Me, and if any one shall say anything to you, say ye that the Lord hath need of them, and forthwith he will let them go."
<p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: He mounted upon the ass, which was covered with the garments of the Apostles.
<p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: They went out to receive Him, strewing in the way their garments and the branches of the trees, saying: "`Save us, Son of David, blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord: Save us in the heights!'"
