### PRELUDE FOR MAKING ELECTION

**First Point**. In every good election, as far as depends on us, the
eye of our intention ought to be simple, only looking at what we are
created for, namely, the praise of God our Lord and the salvation of our
soul. And so I ought to choose whatever I do, that it may help me for
the end for which I am created, not ordering or bringing the end to the
means, but the means to the end: as it happens that many choose first to
marry -- which is a means -- and secondarily to serve God our Lord in
the married life -- which service of God is the end. So, too, there are
others who first want to have benefices, and then to serve God in them.
So that those do not go straight to God, but want God to come straight
to their disordered tendencies, and consequently they make a means of
the end, and an end of the means. So that what they had to take first,
they take last; because first we have to set as our aim the wanting to
serve God, -- which is the end, -- and secondarily, to take a benefice,
or to marry, if it is more suitable to us, -- which is the means for the
end. So, nothing ought to move me to take such means or to deprive
myself of them, except only the service and praise of God our Lord and
the eternal salvation of my soul.
