### OF THE MYSTERIES DONE FROM THE HOUSE OF PILATE TO THE CROSS, INCLUSIVE

John 19 \[15-20\].

**First Point.** First: Pilate, seated as judge, delivered Jesus to them
to crucify Him, after the Jews had denied Him for king, saying: "\`We
have no king but Caesar!\`"

**Second Point.** Second: He took the Cross on His shoulders and not
being able to carry it, Simon of Cyrene was constrained to carry it
after Jesus.

**Third Point.** Third: They crucified Him between two thieves, setting
this title: "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews."
