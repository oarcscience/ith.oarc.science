<p> <b>First Point</b>. First: They bring the Child Jesus to the Temple, that He may be presented to the Lord as first-born; and they offer for Him "a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons."
<p> <b>Second Point</b>. Second: Simeon coming to the Temple "took Him into his arms" saying: "`Now Thou dost dismiss Thy servant, O Lord, in peace!'"
<p> <b>Third Point</b>. Third: Anna "coming afterwards confessed to the Lord, and spoke of Him to all that were hoping for the redemption of Israel."
