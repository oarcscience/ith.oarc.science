<p> <b>First Point.</b> First: Christ our Lord being on the mountain, made His Disciples go to the little boat. And having dismissed the multitude, He commenced to pray alone.
<p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: The little boat was beaten by the waves. To which Christ came walking on the water; and the Disciples thought it was an apparition.
<p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: Christ saying to them: "`It is I, fear not,'" St. Peter, by His command, came to Him walking on the water. Doubting, he commenced to sink, but Christ our Lord freed him and reprehended him for his little faith, and then, as He entered into the little boat, the wind ceased.
