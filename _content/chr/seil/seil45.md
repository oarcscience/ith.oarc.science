### OF THE PURIFICATION OF OUR LADY AND PRESENTATION OF THE CHILD JESUS

St. Luke writes, Chapter 2 \[23-39\].

**First Point**. First: They bring the Child Jesus to the Temple, that
He may be presented to the Lord as first-born; and they offer for Him "a
pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons."

**Second Point**. Second: Simeon coming to the Temple "took Him into his
arms" saying: "\`Now Thou dost dismiss Thy servant, O Lord, in peace!'"

**Third Point**. Third: Anna "coming afterwards confessed to the Lord,
and spoke of Him to all that were hoping for the redemption of Israel."
