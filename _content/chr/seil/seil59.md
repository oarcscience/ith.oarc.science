### OF THE CONVERSION OF MAGDALEN

St. Luke writes in the seventh Chapter \[36-50\].

**First Point.** First: Magdalen enters where Christ our Lord is seated
at the table in the house of the Pharisee. She bore a vase of alabaster
full of ointment.

**Second Point.** Second: Standing behind the Lord near His feet, she
commenced to wash them with tears and dried them with the hairs of her
head, and kissed His feet and anointed them with ointment.

**Third Point.** Third: When the Pharisee accused Magdalen, Christ
speaks in her defence, saying: "\`Many sins are forgiven her because she
loves much.' And He said to the woman: \`Thy faith hath made thee safe:
go in peace.'"
