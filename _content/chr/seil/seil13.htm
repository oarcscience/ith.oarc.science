<p> After this I will make three Colloquies in the following manner:
<p> <b>First Colloquy</b>. The first Colloquy to Our Lady, that she may get me grace from Her Son and Lord for three things: first, that I may feel an interior knowledge of my sins, and hatred of them; second, that I may feel the disorder of my actions, so that, hating them, I may correct myself and put myself in order; third, to ask knowledge of the world, in order that, hating it, I may put away from me worldly and vain things.
<p> And with that a HAIL MARY.
<p> <b>Second Colloquy</b>. The second: The same to the Son, begging Him to get it for me from the Father.
<p> And with that the SOUL OF CHRIST.
<p> <b>Third Colloquy</b>. The third: The same to the Father, that the Eternal Lord Himself may grant it to me.
<p> And with that an OUR FATHER.
