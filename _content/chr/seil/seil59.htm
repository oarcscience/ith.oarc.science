<p> <b>First Point.</b> First: Magdalen enters where Christ our Lord is seated at the table in the house of the Pharisee. She bore a vase of alabaster full of ointment.
<p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: Standing behind the Lord near His feet, she commenced to wash them with tears and dried them with the hairs of her head, and kissed His feet and anointed them with ointment.
<p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: When the Pharisee accused Magdalen, Christ speaks in her defence, saying: "`Many sins are forgiven her because she loves much.' And He said to the woman: `Thy faith hath made thee safe: go in peace.'"
