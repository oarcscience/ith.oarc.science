<p> <b>First Point.</b> First: Herod sends Him back to Pilate. By this they were made friends, who before were enemies.
<p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him; and the soldiers made a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and they clothed Him with purple and came to Him and said: "`Hail, King of the Jews!'", and they gave Him buffets.
<p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: He brought Him forth in the presence of all. "Then Jesus went forth crowned with thorns and clothed with a purple garment, and Pilate said to them: `Here is the Man!'" and when the Priests saw Him, they shouted, saying: "`Crucify, crucify Him!'"
