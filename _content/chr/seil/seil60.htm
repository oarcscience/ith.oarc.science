<p> <b>First Point.</b> First: The Disciples, as it was getting late, ask Christ to dismiss the multitude of men who were with Him.
<p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: Christ our Lord commands that they bring Him bread, and commanded that they should be seated at the table, and blessed and broke and gave the bread to His Disciples, and the Disciples to the multitude.
<p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: "They did eat and were filled and there were twelve baskets over."
