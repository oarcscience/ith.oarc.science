<p> The first time is in the morning, immediately on rising, when one ought to propose to guard himself with diligence against that particular sin or defect which he wants to correct and amend.
<p> The second time is after dinner, when one is to ask of God our Lord what one wants, namely, grace to remember how many times he has fallen into that particular sin or defect, and to amend himself in the future. Then let him make the first Examen, asking account of his soul of that particular thing proposed, which he wants to correct and amend. Let him go over hour by hour, or period by period, commencing at the hour he rose, and continuing up to the hour and instant of the present examen, and let him make in the first line of the G<sup><b><u>-------</u></b></sup> as many dots as were the times he has fallen into that particular sin or defect. Then let him resolve anew to amend himself up to the second Examen which he will make.
<p> The third time: After supper, the second Examen will be made, in the same way, hour by hour, commencing at the first Examen and continuing up to the present (second) one, and let him make in the second line of the same G<sup><b><u>-------</u></b></sup> as many dots as were the times he has fallen into that particular sin or defect.  <a></a> <h4 align="center">FOUR ADDITIONS FOLLOW TO RID ONESELF SOONER OF THAT PARTICULAR SIN OR DEFECT</h4> <b>First Addition</b>. The first Addition is that each time one falls into that particular sin or defect, let him put his hand on his breast, grieving for having fallen: which can be done even in the presence of many, without their perceiving what he is doing.
<p> <b>Second Addition</b>. The second: As the first line of the G<sup><b><u>-------</u></b></sup> means the first Examen, and the second line the second Examen, let him look at night if there is amendment from the first line to the second, that is, from the first Examen to the second.
<p> <b>Third Addition</b>. The third: To compare the second day with the first; that is, the two Examens of the present day with the other two Examens of the previous day, and see if he has amended himself from one day to the other.
<p> <b>Fourth Addition</b>. The fourth Addition: To compare one week with another, and see if he has amended himself in the present week over the week past.
<p> <b>Note</b>. It is to be noted that the first (large) G<sup><b><u>-------</u></b></sup> which follows means the Sunday: the second (smaller), the Monday: the third, the Tuesday, and so on.
