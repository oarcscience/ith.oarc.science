### OF THE VISITATION OF OUR LADY TO ELIZABETH

St. Luke speaks in the first Chapter \[39-57\].

**First Point**. First: As Our Lady visited Elizabeth, St. John Baptist,
being in his mother's womb, felt the visitation which Our Lady made.
"And when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Our Lady, the infant leaped
in her womb. And Elizabeth, full of the Holy Ghost, cried out with a
loud voice, and said: \`Blessed be thou among women and blessed be the
fruit of thy womb!'"

**Second Point**. Second: Our Lady sings the canticle, saying: "\`My
soul doth magnify the Lord!'"

**Third Point**. Third: "Mary abode with Elizabeth about three months:
and then she returned to her house."
