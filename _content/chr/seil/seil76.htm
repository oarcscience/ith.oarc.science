This, although it is not said in Scripture, is included in saying that He appeared to so many others, because Scripture supposes that we have understanding,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="seil83.htm#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A> as it is written: "`Are you also without understanding?"`  <a></a> <h3 align="center" align="center">OF THE SECOND APPARITION</h3> Mark, Chapter 16 [9].
<p> <b>First Point.</b> First: Mary Magdalen, Mary, the mother of James, and Salome come very&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="seil83.htm#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A> early to the Sepulchre saying: "`Who shall lift for us the stone from the door of the Sepulchre?'"
<p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: They see the stone lifted, and the Angel, who says: "`You seek Jesus of Nazareth. He is already risen, He is not here.'"
<p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: He appeared to Mary, who remained about the Sepulchre after the others had gone.  <a></a> <h3 align="center" align="center">OF THE THIRD APPARITION</h3> St. Matthew, last Chapter.
<p> <b>First Point.</b> First: These Maries go from the Sepulchre with fear and joy, wanting to announce to the Disciples the Resurrection of the Lord.
<p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: Christ our Lord appeared to them on the way, saying to them: "Hail:" and they approached and threw themselves at His feet and adored Him.
<p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: Jesus says to them: "`Fear not! Go and tell My brethren that they go into Galilee, for there they shall see Me.'"  <a></a> <h3 align="center" align="center">OF THE FOURTH APPARITION</h3> Last Chapter of Luke [12, 34].
<p> <b>First Point.</b> First: Having heard from the women that Christ was risen, St. Peter went quickly to the Sepulchre.
<p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: Entering into the Sepulchre, he saw only the cloths with which the Body of Christ our Lord had been covered, and nothing else.
<p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: As St. Peter was thinking of these things, Christ appeared to Him, and therefore the Apostles said: "`Truly the Lord has risen and appeared to Simon.'"  <a></a> <h3 align="center" align="center">OF THE FIFTH APPARITION</h3> In the last Chapter of St. Luke.
<p> <b>First Point.</b> First: He appeared to the Disciples who were going to Emmaus, talking of Christ.
<p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: He reproves them, showing by the Scriptures that Christ had to die and rise again: "`O foolish and slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary that Christ should suffer and so enter into His glory?"`
<p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: At their prayer, He lingers there, and was with them until, in giving them Communion, He disappeared. And they, returning, told the Disciples how they had known Him in the Communion.  <a></a> <h3 align="center" align="center">OF THE SIXTH APPARITION</h3> John, Chapter 20 [19-24].
<p> <b>First Point.</b> First: The Disciples, except St. Thomas, were gathered together for fear of the Jews.
<p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: Jesus appeared to them, the doors being shut, and being in the midst of them, He says: "`Peace be with you!'"
<p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: He gives them the Holy Ghost, saying to them: "`Receive ye the Holy Ghost: to those whose sins you shall forgive, to them they shall be forgiven.'"  <a></a> <h3 align="center" align="center">THE SEVENTH APPARITION</h3> John 20 [24-30].
<p> <b>First Point.</b> First: St. Thomas, incredulous because he was absent from the preceding apparition, says: "If I do not see Him, I will not believe."
<p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: Jesus appears to them eight days from that, the doors being shut, and says to St. Thomas: "`Put here thy finger and see the truth; and be not incredulous, but believing.'"
<p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: St. Thomas believed, saying: "`My Lord and my God!" Christ said to him: "`Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.'"  <a></a> <h3 align="center" align="center">OF THE EIGHTH APPARITION</h3> John, last Chapter [1-24].
<p> <b>First Point.</b> First: Jesus appears to seven of His Disciples&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="seil83.htm#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A> who were fishing, and had taken nothing all night; and spreading the net by His command, "They were not able to draw it out for the multitude of the fishes."
<p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: By this miracle St. John knew Him and said to St. Peter: "`It is the Lord!'" He cast himself into the sea and came to Christ.
<p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: He gave them to eat part of a fish roasted, and a comb of honey,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="seil83.htm#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A> and recommended the sheep to St. Peter, having first examined him three times on charity, and says to him: "`Feed My sheep! `"  <a></a> <h3 align="center" align="center">OF THE NINTH APPARITION</h3> Matthew, last Chapter [16-end].
<p> <b>First Point.</b> First: The Disciples, by command of the Lord, go to Me. Thabor.
<p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: Christ appears to them and says: "`All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth.'"
<p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: He sent them through all the world to preach, saying: "`Go and teach ye all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.'"  <a></a> <h3 align="center" align="center">OF THE TENTH APPARITION</h3> In the First Epistle to the Corinthians, Chapter 15 [7]. "Afterwards He was seen by more than five hundred brethren together."  <a></a> <h3 align="center" align="center">OF THE ELEVENTH APPARITION</h3> In the First Epistle to the Corinthians, Chapter 15 [7]. "Afterwards He appeared to St. James."  <a></a> <h3 align="center" align="center">OF THE TWELFTH APPARITION</h3> He appeared to Joseph of Arimathea, as is piously meditated and is read in the lives of the Saints.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="seil83.htm#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A>  <a></a> <h3 align="center" align="center">OF THE THIRTEENTH APPARITION</h3> First Epistle to the Corinthians, Chapter 15 [8].
