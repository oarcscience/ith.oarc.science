<p> <b>First Point</b>. First: Christ our Lord, of the age of twelve years, went up from Nazareth to Jerusalem.
<p> <b>Second Point</b>. Second: Christ our Lord remained in Jerusalem, and His parents did not know it.
<p> <b>Third Point</b>. Third: The three days passed, they found Him disputing in the Temple, and seated in the midst of the doctors, and His parents asking Him where He had been, He answered: "`Did you not know that it behooves Me to be in the things which are My Father's?'"
