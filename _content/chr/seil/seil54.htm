<p> <b>First Point.</b> First: With a whip made of cords, He cast out of the Temple all those who were selling.
<p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: He turned over the tables and money of the rich bankers who were in the Temple.
<p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: To the poor who sold doves, He mildly said: "`Take these things from here, and make not My house a house of traffic.'"
