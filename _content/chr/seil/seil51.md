### OF HOW CHRIST WAS TEMPTED

St. Luke writes in the fourth Chapter \[1-14\] and St. Matthew fourth
Chapter \[1-12\].

**First Point.** First: After being baptized, He went to the Desert,
where He fasted forty days and forty nights.

**Second Point.** Second: He was tempted by the enemy three times. "The
tempter coming to Him said to Him: \`If Thou be the Son of God, say that
these stones be turned into bread.' \`Cast Thyself down from here.' \`If
prostrate on the earth Thou wilt adore me, I will give Thee all this
which Thou seest.'"

**Third Point.** Third: "The Angels came and ministered to Him."
