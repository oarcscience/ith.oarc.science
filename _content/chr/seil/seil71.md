### OF THE MYSTERIES DONE FROM THE HOUSE OF PILATE TO THAT OF HEROD

**First Point.** First: Pilate sent Jesus, a Galilean, to Herod,
Tetrarch of Galilee.

**Second Point.** Second: Herod, curious, questioned Him much and He
answered him nothing, although the Scribes and Priests were accusing Him
constantly.

**Third Point.** Third: Herod despised Him with his army, clothing Him
with a white garment.
