### OF THE MYSTERIES DONE FROM THE HOUSE OF HEROD TO THAT OF PILATE

Matthew 26, <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](seil83.htm#fn_28) Luke 23, Mark
15, and John 19.

**First Point.** First: Herod sends Him back to Pilate. By this they
were made friends, who before were enemies.

**Second Point.** Second: Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him; and the
soldiers made a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and they clothed
Him with purple and came to Him and said: "\`Hail, King of the Jews!'",
and they gave Him buffets.

**Third Point.** Third: He brought Him forth in the presence of all.
"Then Jesus went forth crowned with thorns and clothed with a purple
garment, and Pilate said to them: \`Here is the Man!'" and when the
Priests saw Him, they shouted, saying: "\`Crucify, crucify Him!'"
