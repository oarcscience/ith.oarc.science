### OF THE MYSTERIES DONE FROM THE GARDEN TO THE HOUSE OF ANNAS, INCLUSIVE

Matthew 26, Luke 22, Mark 15.

**First Point.** First: The Lord lets Himself be kissed by Judas and
taken as a robber, to whom He said: "\`You have come out as to a robber
to apprehend Me with clubs and arms; when I was daily with you in the
Temple teaching and you did not take Me."\` And He saying: "\`Whom seek
ye?"\` the enemies fell on the earth.

**Second Point.** Second: St. Peter wounded a servant of the High
Priest, and the meek Lord said to Peter: "\`Return thy sword into its
place,'" and He healed the wound of the servant.

**Third Point.** Third: Left by His Disciples, He is taken to Annas,
where St. Peter, who had followed Him from afar, denied Him once, and a
blow was given Christ by one saying to Him: "\`Answerest Thou the High
Priest so?"\`
