### OF THE SUPPER

Matthew 26; John 13.

**First Point.** First: He ate the Paschal Lamb with His twelve
Apostles, to whom He foretold His death. "\`In truth, I say to you that
one of you is to sell Me.'"

**Second Point.** Second: He washed the Disciples' feet, even those of
Judas, commencing from St. Peter, who, considering the Majesty of the
Lord and his own baseness, not wanting to consent, said: "Lord, dost
Thou wash my feet?" But St. Peter did not know that in that He gave an
example of humility, and for this He said: "\`I have given you an
example, that you may do as I did.'"

**Third Point.** Third: He instituted the most sacred sacrifice of the
Eucharist, to be the greatest mark of His love, saying: "\`Take and
eat.'" The Supper finished, Judas went forth to sell Christ our Lord.
