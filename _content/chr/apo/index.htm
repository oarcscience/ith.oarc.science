<P>
Apocrypha means 'hidden things' in Greek.
The Apocryphical books of the Bible fall into two categories:
texts which were included in some canonical version
of the Bible at some point, and other texts of a Biblical nature
which have never been canonical.
</P>

<H2>Deuterocanonical Apocrypha</H2>

<P>
<A HREF="../../bib/apo/index.htm">The Deuterocanonical Books of the Bible</A>
These
are books which are included in some version of the
canonical Bible, but which have been excluded
at one time or another, for textual or doctrinal issues.
These are called 'Deuterocanonical',
which literally means 'the secondary canon.'
</P>
<HR>
<A NAME="etc"></A>
<H2>Other Apocrypha</H2>

<P>
These are other apocryphal texts which never made it into any official
canon, which nevertheless shed light on the Bible and its history.</P>
