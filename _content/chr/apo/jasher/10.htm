<P>1 And Peleg the son of Eber died in those days, in the forty-eighth year of the life of Abram
son of Terah, and all the days of Peleg were two hundred and thirty-nine years.<P>


<P>2 And when the Lord had scattered the sons of men on account of their sin at the tower,
behold they spread forth into many divisions, and all the sons of men were dispersed into the
four corners of the earth.<P>


<P>3 And all the families became each according to its language, its land, or its city.<P>


<P>4 And the sons of men built many cities according to their families, in all the places where
they went, and throughout the earth where the Lord had scattered them.<P>


<P>5 And some of them built cities in places from which they were afterward extirpated, and they
called these cities after their own names, or the names of their children, or after their
particular occurrences.<P>


<P>6 And the sons of Japheth the son of Noah went and built themselves cities in the places
where they were scattered, and they called all their cities after their names, and the sons of
Japheth were divided upon the face of the earth into many divisions and languages.<P>


<P>7 And these are the sons of Japheth according to their families, Gomer, Magog, Medai,
Javan, Tubal, Meshech and Tiras; these are the children of Japheth according to their
generations.<P>

<P>10 And the children of Tugarma are ten families, and these are their names: Buzar,
Parzunac, Balgar, Elicanum, Ragbib, Tarki, Bid, Zebuc, Ongal and Tilmaz; all these spread
and rested in the north and built themselves cities.<P>


<P>11 And they called their cities after their own names, those are they who abide by the rivers
Hithlah and Italac unto this day.<P>


<P>12 But the families of Angoli, Balgar and Parzunac, they dwell by the great river Dubnee; and

<P>15 And the children of Elishah are the Almanim, and they also went and built themselves

Tibreu.<P>


<P>17 And the children of Dudonim are those who dwell in the cities of the sea Gihon, in the land
of Bordna.<P>


<P>18 These are the families of the children of Japheth according to their cities and languages,
when they were scattered after the tower, and they called their cities after their names and
occurrences; and these are the names of all their cities according to their families, which they
built in those days after the tower.<P>


<P>19 And the children of Ham were Cush, Mitzraim, Phut and Canaan according to their
generation and cities.<P>


<P>20 All these went and built themselves cities as they found fit places for them, and they called
their cities after the names of their fathers Cush, Mitzraim, Phut and Canaan.<P>


<P>21 And the children of Mitzraim are the Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuchim, Pathrusim,
Casluchim and Caphturim, seven families.<P>


<P>22 All these dwell by the river Sihor, that is the brook of Egypt, and they built themselves
cities and called them after their own names.<P>


<P>23 And the children of Pathros and Casloch intermarried together, and from them went forth

names of their cities after their own names.<P>


<P>27 And they and their children and all belonging to them dwelt in those cities, and they were
fruitful and multiplied greatly and dwelt peaceably.<P>


<P>28 And Seir the son of Hur, son of Hivi, son of Canaan, went and found a valley opposite to
Mount Paran, and he built a city there, and he and his seven sons and his household dwelt
there, and he called the city which he built Seir, according to his name; that is the land of Seir

<P>29 These are the families of the children of Ham, according to their languages and cities,
when they were scattered to their countries after the tower.<P>


<P>30 And some of the children of Shem son of Noah, father of all the children of Eber, also went

<P>31 And the sons of Shem were Elam, Ashur, Arpachshad, Lud and Aram, and they built
themselves cities and called the names of all their cities after their names.<P>


<P>32 And Ashur son of Shem and his children and household went forth at that time, a very
large body of them, and they went to a distant land that they found, and they met with a very
extensive valley in the land that they went to, and they built themselves four cities, and they
called them after their own names and occurrences.<P>
