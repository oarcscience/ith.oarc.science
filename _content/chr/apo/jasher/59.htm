<P>18 And the sons of Joseph, that were born unto him in Egypt, were Manasseh and Ephraim.<P>


<P>19 And all the souls that went forth from the loins of Jacob, were seventy souls; these are
they who came with Jacob their father unto Egypt to dwell there: and Joseph and all his
brethren dwelt securely in Egypt, and they ate of the best of Egypt all the days of the life of
Joseph.<P>


<P>20 And Joseph lived in the land of Egypt ninety-three years, and Joseph reigned over all
Egypt eighty years.<P>


<P>21 And when the days of Joseph drew nigh that he should die, he sent and called for his
brethren and all his father's household, and they all came together and sat before him.<P>


<P>22 And Joseph said unto his brethren and unto the whole of his father's household, Behold I
die, and God will surely visit you and bring you up from this land to the land which he swore to
your fathers to give unto them.<P>


<P>23 And it shall be when God shall visit you to bring you up from here to the land of your
fathers, then bring up my bones with you from here.<P>
 

<P>24 And Joseph made the sons of Israel to swear for their seed after them, saying, God will
surely visit you and you shall bring up my bones with you from here.<P>


<P>25 And it came to pass after this that Joseph died in that year, the seventy-first year of the
Israelites going down to Egypt.<P>


<P>26 And Joseph was one hundred and ten years old when he died in the land of Egypt, and all
his brethren and all his servants rose up and they embalmed Joseph, as was their custom,
and his brethren and all Egypt mourned over him for seventy days.<P>


<P>27 And they put Joseph in a coffin filled with spices and all sorts of perfume, and they buried
him by the side of the river, that is Sihor, and his sons and all his brethren, and the whole of
his father's household made a seven day's mourning for him.<P>


<P>28 And it came to pass after the death of Joseph, all the Egyptians began in those days to
rule over the children of Israel, and Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who reigned in his father's stead,
took all the laws of Egypt and conducted the whole government of Egypt under his counsel,
and he reigned securely over his people.<P>
