### CHAPTER XI

<span class="small">How Friar Juniper once went to Assisi for his
confusion</span>

ONCE, while Friar Juniper was sojourning in the Val di Spoleto, he heard
that there was a great festival at Assisi, and that many folk were going
thither with great devotion; and there came to him a desire to go to
this festival; and hearken how he did it. Friar Juniper stripped himself
all naked save only for his breeches, and so set out, passing through
Spoleto through the midst of the city; and thus naked he came to the
convent. The friars were much disquieted and

scandalised and rebuked him very harshly, calling him madman and fool
and troubler of the Order of St. Francis, and saying that he should be
chained up, as a madman. And the General, who was then in the Place,
caused all the friars to be called and Friar Juniper with them; and, in
the presence of all the convent, he gave him a severe and stern reproof.
And, after many words, speaking as one with authority to punish, he said
to Friar Juniper: "Thy fault is such and so great that I know not what
fitting penance to give thee". Whereupon Friar Juniper, even as one who
delighteth in his own confusion, made answer: "Father, I will tell thee:
as I have come hither naked, so for penance let me return again, in the
same guise, to the place wherefrom I set out to come to this festival".
