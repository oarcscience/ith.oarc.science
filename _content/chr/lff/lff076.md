### CHAPTER XIV

<span class="small">Of the hand which Friar Juniper saw in the
air</span>

ONCE, when Friar Juniper was praying, and peradventure thinking too
highly of himself, it seemed to him that he saw a hand in the air, and
heard a voice with his bodily ears, which spake unto him after this
manner: "O Friar Juniper, with this hand thou canst do nothing". Whereat
he forthwith rose up, and, having lifted up and turned his eyes toward
heaven, he cried in a loud voice, as he ran through the convent: "Indeed
it is true, indeed it is true". And this he kept on repeating for a long
time.
