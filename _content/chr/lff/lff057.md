### OF THE MOST HOLY STIGMATA

###### OF

# ST. FRANCIS

#### AND OF THEIR CONSIDERATIONS

IN THIS PART WE SHALL BEHOLD WITH DEVOUT  
CONSIDERATION THE GLORIOUS, SACRED  
AND HOLY STIGMATA OF OUR BLESSED  
FATHER, MESSER SAINT FRANCIS,  
THE WHICH HE RECEIVED OF  
CHRIST UPON THE HOLY  
MOUNTAIN OF  
ALVERNIA

*Because the said stigmata were five, even as the wounds of our Lord
Jesus Christ were five, therefore this treatise will have five
considerations.*

*The first consideration will be touching the manner in which St.
Francis came to the holy mountain of Alvernia.*

*The second consideration will be touching the life which he lived, and
the conversation which he held with his companions on the said holy
mountain.*

*The third consideration will be touching the seraphic vision and the
imprinting of the most sacred stigmata.*

*The fourth consideration will be how St. Francis descended from the
mountain of Alvernia, after he had*

*received the sacred stigmata, and returned to Santa Maria degli
Angeli.*

*The fifth consideration will be touching certain Divine visions and
revelations made after the death of St. Francis to holy friars and to
other devout persons concerning the said sacred and glorious stigmata*.
