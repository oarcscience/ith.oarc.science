<p>FRIAR BUONAVENTURA of Bagnoreggio was wont to say of Friar Giles that God had given and granted unto him special grace for all those who commended themselves unto him with devout intention as touching those things which appertain unto the soul. He wrought many miracles in his life, and after his death, as appeareth from his Legend; and he passed from this life to the glory supernal in the year of Our Lord M.CC.LII., <font size="-1" color="green">(1252)</font> on the day of the Feast of St. George, and was buried at Perugia in the convent of the Minor Friars.</p>
