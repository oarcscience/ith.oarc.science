    Section VII.


         When we were come to where the three fellows were hanged, he said that he
    doubted that that would be his end also. Only he seemed glad when he saw the
    Cross and the Sepulchre. There I confess he desired to stay a little to look,
    and he seemed for a while after to be a little cheery. When we came to the
    Hill Difficulty, he made no stick at that, nor did he much fear the Lions; for
    you must know that his trouble was not about such things as those, his fear
    was about his acceptance at last.


         I got him at the House Beautiful, I think, before he was willing. Also
    when he was in, I brought him acquainted with the Damsels that were of the
    place, but he was ashamed to make himself much for company. He desired much to
    be alone, yet he always loved good talk, and often would get behind the Screen
    to hear it. He also loved much to see antient things, and to be pondering them
    in his mind. He told me afterwards that he loved to be in those two houses
    from which he came last, to wit, at the Gate, and that of the Interpreter's,
    but that he durst not be so bold to ask.


         When we went also from the House Beautiful, down the Hill into the Valley
    of Humiliation, he went down as well as ever I saw man in my life; for he
    cared not how mean he was, so he might be happy at last. Yea, I think there
    was a kind of sympathy betwixt that Valley and him, for I never saw him better
    in all his Pilgrimage than when he was in that Valley.


         Here he would lie down, embrace the ground and kiss the very Flowers that
    grew in this Valley. He would now be up every morning by break of day, tracing
    and walking to and fro in this Valley.


         But when he was come to the entrance of the Valley of the Shadow of
    Death, I thought I should have lost my man; not for that he had any
    inclination to go back, that he always abhorred, but he was ready to die for
    fear. O, the Hobgoblins will have me, the Hobgoblins will have me, cried he,
    and I could not beat him out on't. He made such a noise and such an outcry
    here, that, had they but heard him, 'twas enough to encourage them to come and
    fall upon us.


         But this I took very great notice of, that this Valley was as quiet while
    he went through it, as ever I knew it before or since. I suppose these Enemies
    here had now a special check from our Lord, and a command not to meddle until
    Mr Fearing was past over it.


         It would be too tedious to tell you of all. We will therefore only
    mention a passage or two more. When he was come at Vanity Fair, I thought he
    would have fought with all the men in the Fair. I feared there we should both
    have been knock'd o' the head, so hot was he against their fooleries. Upon the
    Inchanted Ground he was also very wakeful. But when he was come at the River
    where was no Bridge, there again he was in a heavy case. Now, now, he said, he
    should be drowned for ever, and so never see that face with comfort that he
    had come so many miles to behold.


         And here also I took notice of what was very remarkable, the Water of
    that River was lower at this time than ever I saw it in all my life. So he
    went over at last, not much above wet-shod. When he was going up to the
    Gate, Mr Great-heart began to take his leave of him, and to wish him a good
    reception above. So he said, I shall, I shall. Then parted we asunder, and I
    saw him no more.


         Hon. Then it seems he was well at last.


         Great-heart. Yes, yes; I never had doubt about him; he was a man of a
    choice spirit, only he was always kept very low, and that made his life so
    burdensome to himself, and so troublesome to others. He was above many tender
    of sin. He was so afraid of doing injuries to others, that he often would deny
    himself of that which was lawful, because he would not offend.


         Hon. But what should be the reason that such a good man should be all his
    days so much in the dark?


         Great-heart. There are two sorts of reasons for it. One is, the wise
    God will have it so, some must pipe and some must weep. Now Mr Fearing was one
    that played upon this Base; he and his fellows sound the sackbut, whose notes
    are more doleful than the notes of other Musick are; though indeed some say
    the Base is the Ground of Musick. And for my part I care not at all for that
    profession that begins not in heaviness of mind. The first string that the
    Musician usually touches is the Base, when he intends to put all in tune. God
    also plays upon this string first, when he sets the soul in tune for himself.
    Only here was the imperfection of Mr Fearing, he could play upon no other
    Musick but this, till towards his latter end.


         I make bold to talk thus metaphorically, for the ripening of the Wits of
    young Readers; and because in the Book of the Revelations, the saved are
    compared to a company of Musicians that play upon their Trumpets and Harps,
    and sing their Songs before the Throne.


         Hon. He was a very zealous man, as one may see by what relation you have
    given of him. Difficulties, Lions or Vanity Fair, he feared not at all. 'Twas
    only Sin Death and Hell that was to him a terror, because he had some doubts
    about his interest in that Coelestial Country.


         Great-heart. You say right. Those were the things that were his
    troublers, and they, as you have well observed, arose from the weakness of his
    mind there-about, not from weakness of spirit as to the practical part of a
    Pilgrim's life. I dare believe that, as the Proverb is, he could have bit a
    Fire-brand, had it stood in his way; but the things with which he was
    oppressed, no man ever yet could shake off with ease.


         Chris. Then said Christiana, This relation of Mr Fearing has done me
    good. I thought nobody had been like me, but I see there was some semblance
    'twixt this good man and I, only we differed in two things. His troubles were
    so great, they brake out, but mine I kept within. His also lay so hard upon
    him, they made him that he could not knock at the houses provided for
    Entertainment, but my trouble was always such as made me knock the louder.


         Mercy. If I might also speak my heart, I must say that something of him
    has also dwelt in me; for I have ever been more afraid of the Lake and the
    loss of a place in Paradise, than I have been of the loss of other things, Oh,
    thought I, may I have the happiness to have a habitation there, 'tis enough,
    though I part with all the world to win it.


         Matt. Then said Matthew, Fear was one thing that made me think that I was
    far from having that within me that accompanies Salvation, but if it was so
    with such a good man as he, why may it not also go well with me?


         James. No fears, no Grace, said James. Tho' there is not always Grace
    where there is the fear of Hell, yet to be sure there is no Grace where there
    is no fear of God.


         Great-heart. Well said, James, thou hast hit the mark, for the fear of
    God is the beginning of Wisdom, and to be sure they that want the beginning
    have neither middle nor end. But we will here conclude our discourse of Mr
    Fearing, after we have sent after him this farewell.


    Well, Master Fearing, thou didst fear
    Thy God, and wast afraid
    Of doing anything while here
    That would have thee betray'd.


    And didst thou fear the Lake and Pit?
    Would others do so too.
    For as for them that want thy wit,
    They do themselves undo.


         Now I saw that they still went on in their talk; for after Mr Great -
    heart had made an end with Mr Fearing, Mr Honest began to tell them of
    another, but his name was Mr Self-will. He pretended himself to be a
    Pilgrim, said Mr Honest, but I persuade myself he never came in at the Gate
    that stands at the head of the way.


         Great-heart. Had you ever any talk with him about it?


         Hon. Yes, more than once or twice, but he would always be like himself,
    self-willed. He neither cared for man, nor argument, nor yet example; what
    his mind prompted him to do, that he would do, and nothing else could he be
    got to.


         Great-heart. Pray what principles did he hold? for I suppose you can
    tell.


         Hon. He held that a man might follow the Vices as well as the Vertues of
    the Pilgrims, and that if he did both he should be certainly saved.


         Great-heart. How? if he had said 'tis possible for the best to be
    guilty of the Vices, as well as to partake of the Vertues of Pilgrims, he
    could not much have been blamed. For indeed we are exempted from no Vice
    absolutely, but on condition that we watch and strive. But this I perceive is
    not the thing; but if I understand you right, your meaning is, that he was of
    that opinion, that it was allowable so to be?


         Hon. Ay, ay, so I mean, and so he believed and practised.


         Great-heart. But what Ground had he for his so saying?


         Hon. Why, he said he had the Scripture for his Warrant.


         Great-heart. Prithee, Mr. Honest, present us with a few particulars.


         Hon. So I will. He said to have to do with other men's Wives had been
    practised by David, God's beloved, and therefore he could do it. He said to
    have more Women than one, was a thing that Solomon practised, and therefore he
    could do it. He said that Sarah and the godly Midwives of Egypt lied, and so
    did save Rahab, and therefore he could do it. He said that the Disciples went
    at the bidding of their Master, and took away the owner's Ass, and therefore
    he could do so too. He said that Jacob got the Inheritance of his Father in a
    way of Guile and Dissimulation, and therefore he could do so too.


         Great-heart. High base indeed, and you are sure he was of this opinion?


         Hon. I have heard him plead for it, bring Scripture for it, bring
    Argument for it, Ec.


         Great-heart. An opinion that is not fit to be with any allowance in the
    world.


         Hon. You must understand me rightly. He did not say that any man might do
    this, but that those that had the Vertues of those that did such things, might
    also do the same.


         Great-heart. But what more false than such a conclusion? for this is as
    much as to say, that because good men heretofore have sinned of infirmity,
    therefore he had allowance to do it of a presumptuous mind. Or if because a
    Child by the Blast of the Wind, or for that it stumbled at a Stone, fell down
    and defiled itself in mire, therefore he might wilfully lie down and wallow
    like a Boar therein. Who could a thought that any one could so far a been
    blinded by the power of Lust? But what is written must be true, They stumble
    at the word being disobedient, whereunto also they were appointed.


         His supposing that such may have the godly man's Vertues, who addict
    themselves to their Vices, is also a delusion as strong as the other. 'Tis
    just as if the Dog should say, I have or may have the qualities of the Child,
    because I lick up its stinking Excrements. To eat up the Sin of God's People,
    is no sign of one that is possessed with their Vertues. Nor can I believe that
    one that is of this opinion can at present have Faith or Love in him. But I
    know you have made strong objections against him, prithee what can he say for
    himself?


         Hon. Why, he says, To do this by way or opinion, seems abundance more
    honest than to do it, and yet hold contrary to it in opinion.


         Great-heart. A very wicked answer, for tho' to let loose the Bridle to
    Lusts while our opinions are against such things, is bad; yet to sin and plead
    a toleration so to do, is worse. The one stumbles Beholders accidentally, the
    other pleads them into the Snare.


         Hon. There are many of this man's mind, that have not this man's mouth,
    and that makes going on Pilgrimage of so little esteem as it is.


         Great-heart. You have said the truth, and it is to be lamented. But he
    that feareth the King of Paradise shall come out of them all.


         Chris. There are strange opinions in the world, I know one that said,
    'Twas time enough to repent when they come to die.


         Great-heart. Such are not over wise. That man would a been loth, might
    he have had a Week to run twenty mile in for his life, to have deferred that
    Journey to the last hour of that Week.


         Hon. You say right, and yet the generality of them that count themselves
    Pilgrims do indeed do thus. I am, as you see, an old man, and have been a
    traveller in this road many a day, and I have taken notice of many things.


         I have seen some that have set out as if they would drive all the world
    afore them, who yet have in few days died as they in the Wilderness, and so
    never gat sight of the Promised Land.


         I have seen some that have promised nothing at first setting out to be
    Pilgrims, and that one would a thought could not have lived a day, that have
    yet proved very good Pilgrims.


         I have seen some who have spoke very well of that again have after a
    little time run as fast just back again.


         I have seen some who have spoke very well of a Pilgrim's life at first,
    that after a while have spoken as much against it.


         I have heard some when they first set out for Paradise, say positively
    there is such a place, who when they have been almost there, have come back
    again and said there is none.


         I have heard some vaunt what they would do in case they should be
    opposed, that have even at a false alarm fled Faith, the Pilgrim's way, and
    all.


         Now as they were thus in their way, there came one running to meet them,
    and said, Gentlemen and you of the weaker sort, if you love Life shift for
    yourselves, for the Robbers are before you.


         Great-heart. Then said Mr Great-heart, They be the three that set
    upon Little-faith heretofore. Well, said he, we are ready for them. So they
    went on their way. Now they looked at every turning, when they should a met
    with the Villains; but whether they heard of Mr Great-heart, or whether they
    had some other game, they came not up to the Pilgrims.


         Christiana then wished for an Inn for herself and her Children, because
    they were weary. Then said Mr Honest, There is one a little before us, where a
    very honorable Disciple, one Gaius, dwells. So they all concluded to turn in
    thither, and the rather because the old Gentleman gave him so good a report.
    So when they came to the door, they went in, not knocking, for Folks use not
    to knock at the door of an Inn. Then they called for the Master of the house,
    and he came to them. So they asked if they might lie there that night?


         Gaius. Yes Gentlemen, if you be true men, for my house is for none but
    Pilgrims. Then was Christiana, Mercy and the Boys the more glad, for that the
    Innkeeper was a lover of Pilgrims. So they called for Rooms and he shewed them
    one for Christiana and her Children and Mercy, and another for Mr Great -
    heart and the old Gentleman.


         Great-heart. Then said Mr Great-heart, Good Gaius, what hast thou for
    Supper? for these Pilgrims have come far to-day, and are weary.


         Gaius. It is late, said Gaius, so we cannot conveniently go out to seek
    food, but such as we have you shall be welcome to, if that will content.


         Great-heart. We will be content with what thou hast in the house,
    forasmuch as I have proved thee, thou art never destitute of that which is
    convenient.


         Then he went down and spake to the Cook, whose name was Taste-that -
    which-is-good, to get ready Supper for so many Pilgrims. This done, he
    comes up again, saying, Come my good Friends, you are welcome to me, and I am
    glad that I have a house to entertain you; and while Supper is making ready,
    if you please, let us entertain one another with some good discourse. So they
    all said, Content.


         Gauis. Then said Gaius, Whose Wife is this aged Matron? and whose
    Daughter is this young Damsel?


         Great-heart. The Woman is the Wife of one Christian a Pilgrim of former
    times, and these are his four Children. The Maid is one of her Acquaintance,
    one that she hath persuaded to come with her on Pilgrimage. The Boys take all
    after their Father, and covet to tread in his steps; yea, if they do but see
    any place where the old Pilgrim hath lain, or any print of his foot, it
    ministreth joy to their hearts, and they covet to lie or tread in the same.


         Gaius. Then said Gaius, Is this Christian's Wife? and are these
    Christian's Children? I knew your Husband's Father, yea, also his Father's
    Father. Many have been good of this stock, their Ancestors dwelt first at
    Antioch. Christian's Progenitors (I suppose you have heard your Husband talk
    of them) were very worthy men. They have above any that I know, shewed
    themselves men of great Vertue and Courage for the Lord of Pilgrims, his ways
    and them that loved him. I have heard of many of your Husband's Relations that
    have stood all trials for the sake of the Truth. Stephen that was one of the
    first of the Family from whence your Husband sprang, was knocked o' the head
    with Stones. James, another of this Generation, was slain with the edge of the
    Sword. To say nothing of Paul and Peter, men antiently of the Family from
    whence your Husband came, there was Ignatius who was cast to the Lions,
    Romanus whose flesh was cut by pieces from his bones, and Polycarp that played
    the man in the Fire. There was he that was hanged up in a Basket in the Sun
    for the Wasps to eat, and he whom they put into a Sack and cast him into the
    Sea to be drowned. 'Twould be impossible utterly to count up all of that
    Family that have suffered Injuries and Death for the love of a Pilgrim's life.
    Nor can I but be glad to see that thy Husband has left behind him four such
    Boys as these. I hope they will bear up their Father's name, and tread in
    their Father's steps, and come to their Father's end.


         Great-heart. Indeed Sir, they are likely Lads, they seem to chuse
    heartily their Father's ways.


         Gaius. That is it that I said, wherefore Christian's Family is like still
    to spread abroad upon the face of the ground, and yet to be numerous upon the
    face of the earth. Wherefore let Christiana look out some Damsels for her
    Sons, to whom they may be betrothed, &c. that the name of their Father and the
    house of his Progenitors may never be forgotten in the world.


         Hon. 'Tis pity this Family should fall and be extinct.


         Gaius. Fall it cannot, but be diminished it may; but let Christiana take
    my advice, and that's the way to uphold it.


         And Christiana, said this Innkeeper, I am glad to see thee and thy friend
    Mercy together here, a lovely couple. And may I advise, take Mercy into a
    nearer Relation to thee. If she will, let her be given to Matthew thy eldest
    Son, 'tis the way to preserve you a Posterity in the earth. So this match was
    concluded, and in process of time they were married. But more of that
    hereafter.


         Gaius also proceeded and said, I will now speak on the behalf of Women,
    to take away their Reproach. For as Death and the Curse came into the world by
    a Woman; so also did Life and Health: God sent forth his Son, made of a Woman.
    Yea, to shew how much those that came after did abhor the act of their Mother,
    this sex in the Old Testament coveted Children, if happily this or that Woman
    might be the Mother of the Saviour of the World.


         I will say again, that when the Saviour was come, Women rejoiced in him
    before either Man or Angel. I read not that ever any Man did give unto Christ
    so much as one Groat, but the Women followed him and ministered to him of
    their Substance. 'Twas a Woman that washed his Feet with Tears, and a Woman
    that anointed his Body to the Burial. They were Women that wept when he was
    going to the Cross, and Women that followed him from the Cross, and that sat
    by his Sepulchre when he was buried. They were Women that was first with him
    at his Resurrection-morn, and Women that brought tiding first to his
    Disciples that he was risen from the Dead. Women therefore are highly
    favoured, and shew by these things that they are sharers with us in the Grace
    of Life.


         Now the Cook sent up to signify that Supper was almost ready, and sent
    one to lay the Cloath, the Trenchers, and to set the Salt and Bread in order.


         Then said Matthew, The sight of this Cloath and of this forerunner of the
    Supper, begetteth in me a greater Appetite to my food than I had before.


         Gaius. So let all ministring doctrines to thee in this life, beget in
    thee a greater desire to sit at the Supper of the great King in his Kingdom;
    for all Preaching Books and Ordinances here, are but as the laying of the
    Trenchers and as setting of Salt upon the Board, when compared with the Feast
    that our Lord will make for us when we come to his House.


         So Supper came up, and first a Heave-shoulder and a Wave-breast was
    set on the Table before them, to shew that they must begin their meal with
    Prayer and Praise to God. The Heave-shoulder David lifted his Heart up to
    God with, and with the Wave-breast, where his Heart lay, with that he used
    to lean upon his Harp when he played. These two Dishes were very fresh and
    good, and they all at heartily well thereof.


         The next they brought up was a Bottle of Wine, red as Blood. So Gaius
    said to them, Drink freely, this is the Juice of the true Vine that makes glad
    the heart of God and Man. So they drank and were merry.


         The next was a dish of Milk well crumbed. But Gaius said, Let the Boys
    have that, that they may grow thereby.


         Then they brought up in course a dish of Butter and Hony. Then said
    Gaius, Eat freely of this, for this is good to cheer up and strengthen your
    Judgments and Understandings. This was our Lord's dish when he was a Child,
    Butter and Hony shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the Evil and chuse
    the Good.


         Then they brought them up a dish of Apples, and they were very good
    tasted Fruit. Then said Matthew, May we eat Apples, since they were such, by
    and with which the Serpent beguiled our first Mother?


         Then said Gaius,


    Apples were they with which we were beguil'd,
    Yet sin, not Apples, hath our souls defil'd.
    Apples forbid, if eat, corrupts the Blood;
    To eat such when commanded, does us good.
    Drink of his Flagons, then, thou Church, his Dove,
    And eat his Apples, who are sick of Love.


         Then said Matthew, I made the scruple because I a while since was sick
    with eating of Fruit.


         Gaius. Forbidden Fruit will make you sick, but not what our Lord has
    tolerated.


         While they were thus talking, they were presented with another dish, and
    'twas a dish of Nuts. Then said some at the Table, Nuts spoil tender Teeth,
    specially the Teeth of Children; which when Gaius heard, he said,


    Hard Texts are Nuts (I will not call them cheaters)
    Whose Shells do keep their Kernels from the Eaters.
    Ope then the Shells, and you shall have the Meat,
    They here are brought for you to crack and eat.


         Then were they very merry, and sat at the Table a long time, talking of
    many things. Then said the old Gentleman, My good Landlord, while we are
    cracking your Nuts, if you please, do you open this Riddle:


    A man there was, tho' some did count him mad,
    The more he cast away the more he had.


         Then they all gave good heed, wondring what good Gaius would say; so he
    sat still a while, and then thus replied:


    He that bestows his Goods upon the Poor,
    Shall have as much again, and ten times more.


         Then said Joseph, I dare say Sir, I did not think you could a found it
    out.


         Oh, said Gaius, I have been trained up in this way a great while, nothing
    teaches like experience. I have learned of my Lord to be kind, and have found
    by experience that I have gained thereby. There is that scattereth, yet
    increaseth, and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to
    Poverty. There is that maketh himself Rich, yet hath nothing, there is that
    maketh himself Poor, yet hath great Riches.


         Then Samuel whispered to Christiana his Mother, and said, Mother, this is
    a very good man's house, let us stay here a good while, and let my Brother
    Matthew be married here to Mercy before we go any further.


         The which Gaius the Host overhearing said, With a very good will, my
    Child.
