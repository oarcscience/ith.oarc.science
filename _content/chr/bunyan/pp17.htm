Section VI.


     When the Family where Christiana was, saw that they had a purpose to go
forward, they called the whole house together, to give thanks to their King
for sending of them such profitable Guests as these. Which done, they said to
Christiana, And shall we not shew thee something, according as our custom is
to do to Pilgrims, on which thou mayest meditate when thou art upon the way?
So they took Christiana her Children and Mercy, into the closet, and shewed
them one of the Apples that Eve did eat of and that she also did give to her
Husband, and that for the eating of which they both were turned out of
Paradise, and asked her what she thought that was? Then Christiana said, 'Tis
Food or Poison, I know not which. So they opened the matter to her, and she
held up her hands and wondered.


     Then they had her to a place, and shewed her Jacob's Ladder. Now at that
time there were some Angels ascending upon it. So Christiana looked and
looked, to see the Angels go up, and so did the rest of the Company. Then they
were going in to another place to shew them something else, but James said to
his Mother, Pray bid them stay here a little longer, for this is a curious
sight. So they turned again, and stood feeding their eyes with this so
pleasant a prospect. After this they had them into a place where did hang up a
Golden Anchor, so they bid Christiana take it down, For, said they, you shall
have it with you, for 'tis of absolute necessity that you should, that you may
lay hold of that within the vail, and stand steadfast, in case you should meet
with turbulent weather. So they were glad thereof. Then they took them, and
had them to the Mount upon which Abraham our Father had offered up Isaac his
Son, and shewed them the Altar, the Wood, the Fire, and the Knife, for they
remain to be seen to this very day. When they had seen it, they held up their
hands and blest themselves, and said, Oh what a man for love to his Master,
and for denial to himself was Abraham. After they had shewed them all these
things, Prudence took them into the Dining-room, where stood a pair of
excellent Virginals, so she played upon them, and turned what she had shewed
them into this excellent song, saying,


Eve's Apple we have shew'd you,
Of that be you aware;
You have seen Jacob's Ladder too,
Upon which Angels are.
An Anchor you received have,
But let not these suffice,
Until with Abr'am you have gave
Your best a Sacrifice.


     Now about this time, one knocked at the door; so the Porter opened, and
behold Mr Great-heart was there; but when he was come in, what joy was
there? For it came now fresh again into their minds, how but a while ago he
had slain old Grim Bloody-man the Giant, and delivered them from the Lions.


     Then said Mr Great-heart to Christiana and to Mercy, My Lord has sent
each of you a Bottle of Wine, and also some parched Corn, together with a
couple of Pomgranates. He has also sent the Boys some Figs and Raisins to
refresh you on your way.


     Then they addressed themselves to their Journey, and Prudence and Piety
went along with them. When they came at the gate, Christiana asked the Porter
if any of late went by? He said, No, only one some time since, who also told
me that of late there had been a great robbery committed on the King's
Highway, as you go; but he saith the thieves are taken, and will shortly be
tried for their lives. Then Christiana and Mercy were afraid, but Matthew
said, Mother fear nothing, as long as Mr Great-heart is to go with us and to
be our Conductor.


     Then said Christiana to the Porter, Sir, I am much obliged to you for all
the kindnesses that you have shewed me since I came hither, and also for that
you have been so loving and kind to my Children. I know not how to gratify
your kindness. Wherefore pray as a token of my respects to you, accept of this
small mite. So she put a gold Angel in his hand, and he made her a low
obeisance, and said, Let thy Garments be always white, and let thy Head want
no Ointment. Let Mercy live and not die, and let not her works be few. And to
the Boys he said, Do you fly youthful lusts, and follow after Godliness with
them that are grave and wise, so shall you put gladness into your Mother's
heart, and obtain praise of all that are sober-minded. So they thanked the
Porter and departed.


     Now I saw in my Dream that they went forward until they were come to the
brow of the Hill, where Piety bethinking herself, cried out, Alas! I have
forgot what I intended to bestow upon Christiana and her Companions, I will go
back and fetch it. So she ran and fetched it. While she was gone, Christiana
thought she heard in a Grove a little way off on the right hand, a most
curious, melodious note, with words much like these,


Through all my Life thy Favour is
So frankly shew'd to me,
That in thy House for evermore
My dwelling-place shall be.


     And listening still she thought she heard another answer it, saying,


For why? The Lord our God is good,
His Mercy is for ever sure;
His Truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.


     So Christiana asked Prudence what 'twas that made those curious notes?
They are, said she, our Country Birds; they sing these notes but seldom,
except it be at the Spring, when the Flowers appear, and the Sun shines warm,
and then you may hear them all day long. I often, said she, go out to hear
them, we also oft-times keep them tame in our house. They are very fine
company for us when we are melancholy, also they make the Woods and Groves and
Solitary places, places desirous to be in.


     By this time Piety was come again; so she said to Christiana, Look here,
I have brought thee a scheme of all those things that thou hast seen at our
house, upon which thou mayest look when thou findest thyself forgetful, and
call those things again to remembrance for thy edification and comfort.


     Now they began to go down the Hill into the Valley of Humiliation. It was
a steep Hill, and the way was slippery; but they were very careful, so they
got down pretty well. When they were down in the Valley, Piety said to
Christiana, This is the place where Christian your Husband met with that foul
Fiend Apollyon, and where they had that Fight that they had; I know you cannot
but have heard thereof. But be of good courage; as long you have here Mr Great
- heart to be your Guide and Conductor, we hope you will fare the better. So
when these two had committed the Pilgrims unto the conduct of their Guide, he
went forward and they went after.


     Great-heart. Then said Mr Great-heart, we need not to be so afraid of
this Valley, for here is nothing to hurt us unless we procure it to ourselves.
'Tis true, Christian did here meet with Apollyon, with whom he also had a sore
Combat; but that fray was the fruit of those slips that he got in his going
down the Hill; for they that get slips there, must look for combats here. And
hence it is that this Valley has got so hard a name; for the common people
when they hear that some frightful thing has befallen such a one in such a
place, are of an opinion that that place is haunted with some foul Fiend or
evil Spirit; when alas it is for the fruit of their doing, that such things do
befall them there.


     This Valley of Humiliation is of itself as fruitful a place as any the
Crow flies over; and I am persuaded if we could hit upon it, we might find
somewhere hereabouts, something that might give us an account why Christian
was so hardly beset in this place.


     Then James said to his Mother, Lo, yonder stands a Pillar, and it looks
as if something was written thereon, let us go and see what it is. So they
went, and found there written, Let Christian's slips before he came hither,
and the Battles that he met with in this place, be a warning to those that
come after. Lo, said their Guide, did not I tell you that there was something
hereabouts that would give intimation of the reason why Christian was so hard
beset in this place? Then turning himself to Christiana, he said, No
disparagement to Christian more than to many others whose hap and lot his was;
for 'tis easier going up than down this Hill, and that can be said but of few
Hills in all these parts of the world. But we will leave the good man, he is
at rest, he also had a brave Victory over his Enemy, let him grant that
dwelleth above, that we fare no worse when we come to be tried than he.


     But we will come again to this Valley of Humiliation. It is the best and
most fruitful piece of ground in all those parts. It is fat ground, and as you
see, consisteth much in meadows; and if a man was to come here in the Summer -
time, as we do now, if he knew not anything before thereof, and if he also
delighted himself in the sight of his eyes, he might see that would be
delightful to him. Behold how green this Valley is, also how beautified with
Lillies. I have also known many labouring men that have got good estates in
this Valley of Humiliation (for God resisteth the Proud, but gives more Grace
to the Humble) for indeed it is a very fruitful soil, and doth bring forth by
handfuls. Some also have wished that the next way to their Father's house were
here, that they might be troubled no more with either Hills or Mountains, to
go over; but the way is the way, and there's an end.


     Now as they were going along and talking, they espied a Boy feeding his
Father's Sheep. The Boy was in very mean cloaths, but of a very fresh and well
- favoured countenance, and as he sate by himself, he sung. Hark, said Mr
Great-heart, to what the Shepherd's Boy saith. So they hearkened, and he
said,


He that is down needs fear no fall,
He that is low no pride;
He that is humble, ever shall
Have God to be his Guide.
I am content with what I have,
Little be it, or much:
And Lord, contentment still I crave,
Because thou savest such.
Fulness to such a burden is
That go on Pilgrimage;
Here little, and hereafter Bliss,
Is best from age to age.


     Then said their Guide, Do you hear him? I will dare to say, that this Boy
lives a merrier life, and wears more of that Herb called Heart's-ease in his
bosom, than he that is clad in Silk and Velvet; but we will proceed in our
discourse.


     In this Valley our Lord formerly had his Country-house; he loved much
to be here; he loved also to walk these Meadows, for he found the air was
pleasant. Besides here a man shall be free from the noise, and from the
hurryings of this life. All states are full of Noise and Confusion, only the
Valley of Humiliation is that empty and solitary place. Here a man shall not
be so let and hindred in his Contemplation, as in other places he is apt to
be. This is a Valley that nobody walks in, but those that love a Pilgrim's
life. And tho' Christian had the hard hap to meet here with Apollyon, and to
enter with him a brisk encounter, yet I must tell you, that in former times
men have met with Angels here, have found Pearls here, and have in this place
found the words of Life.


     Did I say our Lord had here in former days his Country-house, and that
he loved here to walk? I will add, in this place, and to the people that live
and trace these Grounds, he has left a yearly revenue to be faithfully payed
them at certain seasons, for their maintenance by the way, and for their
further encouragement to go on in their Pilgrimage.


     Samuel. Now as they went on, Samuel said to Mr. Great-heart, Sir, I
perceive that in this Valley my Father and Apollyon had their Battle, but
whereabout was the Fight, for I perceive this Valley is large?


     Great-heart. Your Father had that Battle with Apollyon at a place
yonder before us, in a narrow passage just beyond Forgetful Green. And indeed
that place is the most dangerous place in all these parts. For if at any time
the Pilgrims meet with any brunt, it is when they forget what favours they
have received, and how unworthy they are of them. This is the place also where
others have been hard put to it; but more of the place when we are come to it;
for I persuade myself that to this day there remains either some sign of the
Battle, or some Monument to testify that such a Battle there was fought.


     Mercy. Then said Mercy, I think I am as well in this Valley as I have
been anywhere else in all our Journey, the place methinks suits with my
spirit. I love to be in such places where there is no rattling with Coaches,
nor rumbling with Wheels. Methinks here one may without much molestation, be
thinking what he is, whence he came, what he has done, and to what the King
has called him. Here one may think, and break at heart, and melt in one's
spirit, until one's eyes become like the Fishpools of Heshbon. They that go
rightly through this Valley of Baca make it a Well, the Rain that God sends
down from Heaven upon them that are here also filleth the Pools. This Valley
is that from whence also the King will give to their vineyards, and they that
go through it shall sing, as Christian did for all he met with Apollyon.


     Great-heart. 'Tis true, said their Guide, I have gone through this
Valley many a time, and never was better than when here.


     I have also been a Conduct to several Pilgrims, and they have confessed
the same, To this man will I look, saith the King, even to him that is Poor,
and of a Contrite Spirit, and that trembles at my Word.


     Now they were come to the place where the afore mentioned Battle was
fought. Then said the Guide to Christiana her Children and Mercy, This is the
place, on this ground Christian stood, and up there came Apollyon against him.
And look, did not I tell you? Here is some of your Husband's Blood upon these
stones to this day; behold also how here and there are yet to be seen upon the
place some of the shivers of Apollyon's broken Darts. See also how they did
beat the ground with their feet as they fought, to make good their places
against each other, how also with their by-blows they did split the very
stones in pieces. Verily Christian did here play the man, and shewed himself
as stout, as could, had he been there, even Hercules himself. When Apollyon
was beat, he made his retreat to the next Valley, that is called the Valley of
the Shadow of Death, unto which we shall come anon.


     Lo yonder also stands a Monument, on which is engraven this Battle, and
Christian's Victory, to his fame throughout all ages. So because it stood just
on the wayside before them, they stept to it and read the writing, which word
for word was this.


Hard by here was a Battle fought,
Most strange, and yet most true;
Christian and Apollyon sought
Each other to subdue.
The Man so bravely play'd the Man,
He made the Fiend to fly;
Of which a Monument I stand,
The same to testify.


     When they had passed by this place, they came upon the borders of the
Shadow of Death; and this Valley was longer than the other; a place also most
strangely haunted with evil things, as many are able to testify. But these
Women and Children went the better through it because they had day-light,
and because Mr Great-heart was their Conductor.


     When they were entred upon this Valley, they thought that they heard a
groaning as of dead men, a very great groaning. They thought also they did
hear words of Lamentation spoken, as of some in extreme Torment. These things
made the Boys to quake, the Women also looked pale and wan; but their Guide
bid them be of good comfort.


     So they went on a little further, and they thought that they felt the
ground begin to shake under them, as if some hollow place was there; they
heard also a kind of hissing as of Serpents, but nothing as yet appeared. Then
said the Boys, Are we not yet at the end of this doleful place? But the Guide
also bid them be of good courage, and look well to their feet, lest haply,
said he, you be taken in some Snare.


     Now James began to be sick, but I think the cause thereof was fear; so
his Mother gave him some of that glass of Spirits that she had given her at
the Interpreter's house, and three of the Pills that Mr Skill had prepared,
and the Boy began to revive. Thus they went on till they came to about the
middle of the Valley, and then Christiana said, Methinks I see something
yonder upon the road before us, a thing of such a shape such as I have not
seen. Then said Joseph, Mother, what is it? An ugly thing, Child, an ugly
thing, said she. But Mother, what is it like? said he. 'Tis like I cannot tell
what, said she. And now it was but a little way off. Then said she, It is
nigh.


     Well, well, said Mr Great-heart, Let them that are most afraid keep
close to me. So the Fiend came on, and the Conductor met it; but when it was
just come to him, it vanished to all their sights. Then remembered they what
had been said some time ago, Resist the Devil, and he will fly from you.


     They went therefore on, as being a little refreshed; but they had not
gone far, before Mercy looking behind her, saw, as she thought, something most
like a Lion, and it came a great padding pace after; and it had a hollow Voice
of Roaring, and at every Roar that it gave it made all the Valley echo, and
their hearts to ake, save the heart of him that was their Guide. So it came
up, and Mr Great-heart went behind, and put the Pilgrims all before him. The
Lion also came on apace, and Mr Great-heart addressed himself to give him
Battle. But when he saw that it was determined that resistance should be made,
he also drew back and came no further.


     Then they went on again, and their Conductor did go before them, till
they came at a place where was cast up a Pit the whole breadth of the way, and
before they could be prepared to go over that, a great Mist and a Darkness
fell upon them, so that they could not see. Then said the Pilgrims, Alas! now
what shall we do? But their Guide made answer, Fear not stand still and see
what an end will be put to this also. So they stayed there because their path
was marr'd. They then also thought that they did hear more apparently the
noise and rushing of the Enemies, the fire also and the smoke of the Pit was
much easier to be discerned. Then said Christiana to Mercy, Now I see what my
poor Husband went through, I have heard much of this place, but I never wash
here afore now. Poor man, he went here all alone in the night; he had night
almost quite through the way; also these Fiends were busy about him as if they
would have torn him in pieces. Many have spoke of it, but none can tell what
the Valley of the Shadow of Death should mean, until they come in it
themselves. The heart knows its own Bitterness, and a stranger intermeddleth
not with its Joy. To be here is a fearful thing.


     Great-heart. This is like doing business in great Waters, or like going
down into the deep; this is like being in the heart of the Sea, and like going
down to the bottoms of the Mountains; now it seems as if the Earth with its
bars were about us for ever. But let them that walk in Darkness and have no
Light, trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon their God. For my part, as
I have told you already, I have gone often through this Valley, and have been
much harder put to it than now I am, and yet you see I am alive. I would not
boast, for that I am not mine own saviour, but I trust we shall have a good
Deliverance. Come let us pray for Light to him that can lighten our Darkness,
and that can rebuke not only these, but all the Satans in Hell.


     So they cried and prayed, and God sent Light and Deliverance, for there
was now no let in their way, no not there where but now they were stopt with a
Pit. Yet they were not got through the Valley; so they went on still, and
behold great stinks and loathsome smells, to the great annoyance of them. Then
said Mercy to Christiana, There is not such pleasant being here as at the
Gate, or at the Interpreter's, or at the house where we lay last.


     Oh but, said one of the Boys, it is not so bad to go through here as it
is to abide here always, and for ought I know, one reason why we must go this
way to the house prepared for us, is, that our home might be made the sweeter
to us.


     Well said Samuel, quoth the Guide, thou hast now spoke like a man. Why,
if ever I get out here again, said the Boy, I think I shall prize light and
good way better than ever I did in all my life. Then said the Guide, We shall
be out by and by.


     So on they went, and Joseph said, Cannot we see to the end of this Valley
as yet? Then said the Guide, Look to your feet, for you shall presently be
among the Snares. So they looked to their feet and went on, but they were
troubled much with the Snares. Now when they were come among the Snares, they
espied a man cast into the Ditch on the left hand, with his flesh all rent and
torn. Then said the Guide, That is one Heedless, that was a going this way, he
has lain there a great while. There was one Take-heed with him when he was
taken and slain, but he escaped their hands. You cannot imagine how many are
killed hereabouts, and yet men are so foolishly venturous, as to set out
lightly on Pilgrimage, and to come without a Guide. Poor Christian, it was a
wonder that he here escaped; but he was beloved of his God, also he had a good
heart of his own, or else he could never a done it. Now they drew towards the
end of the way, and just there where Christian had seen the Cave when he went
by, out thence came forth Maul a Giant. This Maul did use to spoil young
Pilgrims with Sophistry; and he called Great-heart by his name, and said
unto him, How many times have you been forbidden to do these things? Then said
Mr Great-heart, What things? What things? quoth the Giant, you know what
things, but I will put an end to your trade. But pray, said Mr Great-heart,
before we fall to it, let us understand wherefore we must fight. Now the Women
and Children stood trembling, and knew not what to do. Quoth the Giant, You
rob the Country, and rob it with the worst of thefts. These are but generals,
said Mr Great-heart, come to particulars, man.


     Then said the Giant, Thou practisest the craft of a Kidnapper, thou
gatherest up Women and Children, and carriest them into a strange Country, to
the weakening of my master's Kingdom. But now Great-heart replied, I am a
servant of the God of Heaven, my business is to persuade sinners to
repentance, I am commanded to do my endeavour to turn Men Women and Children,
from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; and if this be
indeed the ground of thy quarrel, let us fall to it as soon as thou wilt.


     Then the Giant came up, and Mr Great-heart went to meet him; and as he
went he drew his Sword, but the Giant had a Club. So without more ado they
fell to it, and at the first blow the Giant stroke Mr Great-heart down upon
one of his knees; with that the Women and Children cried out; so Mr Great -
heart recovering himself, laid about him in full lusty manner, and gave the
Giant a wound in his arm; thus he fought for the space of an hour to that
height of heat, that the breath came out of the Giant's nostrils, as the heat
doth out of a boiling Caldron.


     Then they sat down to rest them, but Mr Great-heart betook him to
prayer; also the Women and Children did nothing but sigh and cry all the time
that the Battle did last.


     When they had rested them, and taken breath, they both fell to it again,
and Mr Great-heart with a full blow fetched the Giant down to the ground.
Nay hold and let me recover, quoth he. So Mr Great-heart fairly let him get
up. So to it they went again, and the Giant missed but little of all to
breaking Mr Great-heart's skull with his Club.


     Mr Great-heart seeing that, runs to him in the full heat of his spirit,
and pierceth him under the fifth rib; with that the Giant began to faint, and
could hold up his Club no longer. Then Mr Great-heart seconded his blow, and
smit the head of the Giant from his shoulders. Then the Women and Children
rejoiced, and Mr Great-heart also praised God for the deliverance he had
wrought.


     When this was done, they among them erected a Pillar, and fastened the
Giant's head thereon, and wrote underneath in letters that Passengers might
read,


He that did wear this head, was one
That Pilgrims did misuse;
He stopt their way, he spared none,
But did them all abuse;
Until that I Great-heart arose,
The Pilgrim's Guide to be;
Until that I did him oppose
That was their Enemy.


     Now I saw that they went to the Ascent that was a little way off cast up
to be a Prospect for Pilgrims, (that was the place from whence Christian had
the first sight of Faithful his Brother) wherefore here they sat down and
rested, they also here did eat and drink and make merry, for that they had
gotten deliverance from this so dangerous an Enemy. As they sat thus and did
eat, Christiana asked the Guide if he had caught no hurt in the Battle. Then
said Mr Great-heart No. save a little on my flesh; yet that also shall be so
far from being to my determent, that it is at present a proof of my love to my
Master and you, and shall be a means by Grace to increase my reward at lasts.


     Chris. But was you not afraid, good Sir, when you see him come out with
his club?


     Great-heart. It is my duty, said he, to disrust mine own ability that I
have reliance on him that is stronger than all.


     Chris. But what did you think when he fetched you down to the ground at
the first blow?


     Great-Heart. Why I thought, quoth he that so my Master himself was
served, and yet he it was that conquered at the last.


     Matt. When you all have thought what you please, I think God has been
wonderful good unto us, both in bringing us out of this Valley, and in
delivering us out of the hand of this Enemy; for my part I see no reason why
we should distrust our God any more, since he has now, and in such as place as
this, given as such testimony of his love as this.


     Then they got up and went forward. Now a little before them stood an Oak,
and under it when they came to it, they found an old Pilgrim fast asleep; they
knew that he was a Pilgrim by his Cloaths and his Staff and his Girdle.


     So the Guide Mr Great-heart awaked him, and the old Gentleman as he
lift up his eyes, cried out, What's the matter? who are you? and what is your
business here?


     Great-heart. Come man be not so hot, here is none but Friends: yet the
old man gets up and stands upon his guard, and will know of them what they
were. Then said the Guide, My name is Great-heart, I am the Guide of these
Pilgrims which are going to the Coelestial Country.


     Honest. Then said Mr Honest, I cry you mercy, I fear'd that you had been
of the company of those that some time ago did rob Little-faith of his
money; but now I look better about me, I perceive you are honester people.


     Great-heart. Why what would or could you a done to a helped yourself,
if we indeed had been of that company?


     Hon. Done! why I would a fought as long as breath had been in me; and had
I so done, I am sure you could never have given me the worst on't; for a
Christian can never be overcome, unless he shall yield of himself.


     Great-heart. Well said, Father Honest, quoth the Guide, for by this I
know thou art a cock of the right kind, for thou hast said the truth.


     Hon. And by this also I know that thou knowest what true Pilgrimage is,
for all others do think that we are the soonest overcome of any.


     Great-heart. Well now we are so happily met, pray let me crave your
name, and the name of the place you came from.


     Hon. My name I cannot, but I came from the Town of Stupidity, it lieth
about four degrees beyond the City of Destruction.


     Great-heart. Oh! are you that Countryman then? I deem I have half a
guess of you, your name is Old Honesty, is it not? So the old Gentleman
blushed, and said, Not Honesty in the abstract, but Honest is my name, and I
wish that my nature shall agree to what I am called.


     Hon. But Sir, said the old Gentleman, how could you guess that I am such
a man, since I came from such a place?


     Great-heart. I had heard of you before, by my Master, for he knows all
things that are done on the Earth; but I have often wondered that any should
come from your place, for your Town is worse than is the City of Destruction
itself.


     Hon. Yes, we lie more off from the Sun, and so are more cold and
senseless; but was a man in a Mountain of Ice, yet if the Sun of Righteousness
will arise upon him his frozen heart shall feel a thaw; and thus it hath been
with me.


     Great-heart. I believe it, Father Honest, I believe it, for I know the
thing is true.


     Then the old Gentleman saluted all the Pilgrims with a holy kiss of
charity, and asked them of their names, and how they had fared since they set
out on their Pilgrimage.


     Chris. Then said Christiana, My name I suppose you have heard of, good
Christian was my Husband, and these four were his Children. But can you think
how the old Gentleman was taken, when she told them who she was! He skipped,
he smiled, and blessed them with a thousand good wishes, saying,


     Hon. I have heard much of your Husband, and of his travels and Wars which
he underwent in his days. Be it spoken to your comfort, the name of your
Husband rings over all these parts of the world: his Faith, his Courage, his
Enduring, and his Sincerity under all, has made his name famous. Then he
turned him to the Boys, and asked them of their names, which they told him.
And then said he unto them, Matthew, be thou like Matthew the Publican, not in
vice but in vertue. Samuel, said he, be thou like Samuel the Prophet, a man of
faith and prayer. Joseph, said he, be thou like Joseph in Potiphar's house,
chaste, and one that flies from temptation. And James be thou like James the
Just and like James the Brother of our Lord.


     Then they told him of Mercy, and how she had left her Town and her
Kindred to come along with Christiana and with her Sons. At that the old
honest man said, Mercy is thy name? by Mercy shalt thou be sustained, and
carried through all those difficulties that shall assault thee in thy way,
till thou shalt come thither where thou shalt look the Fountain of Mercy in
the face with comfort.


     All this while the Guide Mr Great-heart was very much pleased, and
smiled upon his Companion.


     Now as they walked along together, the Guide asked the old Gentleman if
he did not know one Mr Fearing, that came on Pilgrimage out of his parts?


     Hon. Yes, very well, said he. He was a man that had the root of the
matter in him, but he was one of the most troublesome Pilgrims that ever I met
with in all my days.


     Great-heart. I perceive you knew him, for you have given a very right
character of him.


     Hon. Knew him! I was a great Companion of his; I was with him most an
end; when he first began to think of what would come upon us hereafter, I was
with him.


     Great-heart. I was his Guide from my Master's house to the gates of the
Coelestial City.


     Hon. Then you knew him to be a troublesome one.


     Great-heart. I did so, but I could very well bear it, for men of my
calling are oftentimes intrusted with the conduct of such as he was.


     Hon. Well then, pray let us hear a little of him, and he managed himself
under your conduct.


     Great-heart. Why, he was always afraid that he should come short of
whither he had a desire to go. Everything frightened him that he heard anybody
speak of, that had but the least appearance of opposition in it. I hear that
he lay roaring at the Slough of Dispond for above a month together, nor durst
he, for all he saw several go over before him, venture, tho' they, many of
them, offered to lend him their hand. He would not go back again neither. The
Coelestial City, he said, he should die if he came not to it, and yet was
dejected at every difficulty, and stumbled at every Straw that anybody cast in
his way. Well, after he had lain at the Slough of Dispond a great while, as I
have told you; one Sun-shine morning, I do not know how, he ventured, and so
got over. But when he was over, he would scarce believe it. He had, I think, a
Slough of Dispond in his mind, a Slough that he carried everywhere with him,
or else he could never have been as he was. So he came up to the Gate, you
know what I mean, that stands at the head of this way, and there also he stood
a good while before he would adventure to knock. When the Gate was opened he
would give back, and give place to others, and say that he was not worthy; for
for all he gat before some to the Gate, yet many of them went in before him.
There the poor man would stand shaking and shrinking; I dare say it would have
pitied one's heart to have seen him, nor would he go back again. At last he
took the Hammer that hanged on the Gate in his hand, and gave a small Rap or
two; then one opened to him, but he shrank back as before. He that opened
stept out after him, and said, Thou trembling one, what wantest thou? With
that he fell down to the ground. He that spoke to him wondered to see him so
faint. So he said to him, Peace be to thee, up, for I have set open the door
to thee, come in, for thou art blest. With that he gat up, and went in
trembling, and when he was in, he was ashamed to shew his face. Well, after he
had been entertained there a while, as you know how the manner is, he was bid
go on his way, and also told the way he should take. So he came till he came
to our house. But as he behaved himself at the Gate, so he did at my Master
the Interpreter's door. He lay thereabout in the cold a good while, before he
would adventure to call, yet he would not go back, and the nights were long
and cold then. Nay he had a Note of Necessity in his bosom to my Master, to
receive him and grant him the comfort of his house, and also to allow him a
stout and valiant Conduct because he was himself so chickin-hearted a man;
and yet for all that he was afraid to call at the door. So he lay up and down
thereabouts till, poor man, he was almost starved. Yea so great was his
Dejection, that tho' he saw several others for knocking got in, yet he was
afraid to venture. At last, I think I looked out of the window, and perceiving
a man to be up and down about the door, I went out to him, and asked what he
was; but, poor man, the water stood in his eyes; so I perceived what he
wanted. I went therefore in and told it in the house, and we shewed the thing
to our Lord. So he sent me out again, to entreat him to come in; but I dare
say I had hard work to do it. At last he came in, and I will say that for my
Lord, he carried it wonderful lovingly to him. There were but few good bits at
the Table but some of it was laid upon his trencher. Then he presented the
Note, and my Lord looked thereon, and said his desire should be granted. So
when he had been there a good while, he seemed to get some heart, and to be a
little more comfortable; for my Master, you must know, is one of very tender
bowels, specially to them that are afraid; wherefore he carried it so towards
him as might tend most to his encouragement. Well, when he had had a sight of
the things of the place, and was ready to take his Journey to go to the City,
my Lord, as he did to Christian before, gave him a Bottle of Spirits, and some
comfortable things to eat. Thus we set forward, and I went before him; but the
man was but of few words, only he would sigh aloud.
