    Section II.


         Then Christian fell down at his foot as dead, crying, Wo is me, for I am
    undone: At the sight of which, Evangelist caught him by the right hand,
    saying, All manner of sin and blasphemies shall be forgiven unto men; be not
    faithless, but believing. Then did Christian again a little revive, and stood
    up trembling, as at first, before Evangelist.


         Then Evangelist proceeded, saying, Give more earnest heed to the things
    that I shall tell thee of. I will now shew thee who it was that deluded thee,
    and who it was also to whom he sent thee. The man that met thee is one Worldly
    Wiseman, and rightly is he so called: partly because he savoureth only the
    doctrine of this world, (therefore he always goes to the Town of Morality to
    church); and partly because he loveth that doctrine best, for it saveth him
    from the Cross. And because he is of this carnal temper, teerefore he seeketh
    to prevent my ways, though right. Now there are three things in this man's
    counsel that thou must utterly abhor.


         1. His turning thee out of the way.


         2. His labouring to render the Cross odious to thee.


         3. And his setting thy feet in that way that leadeth unto the
    administration of Death.


         First, Thou must abhor his turning thee out of the way; yea, and thine
    own consenting thereto, because this is to reject the counsel of God for the
    sake of the counsel of a Worldly Wiseman. The Lord says, Strive to enter in at
    the strait gate, the gate to which I sent thee; for strait is the gate that
    leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. From this little Wicket -
    gate, and from the way thereto, hath this wicked man turned thee, to the
    bringing of thee almost to destruction; hate therefore his turning thee out of
    the way, and abhor thyself for hearkening to him.


         Secondly, Thou must abhor his labouring to render the Cross odious unto
    thee; for thou art to prefer it before the treasures of Egypt. Besides, the
    King of Glory hath told thee, that he that will save his life shall lose it:
    and He that comes after him, and hates not his father, and mother, and wife,
    and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea and his own life also, he cannot
    be my Disciple. I say therefore, for a man to labour to persuade thee, that
    that shall be thy death, without which, the Truth hath said, thou canst not
    have eternal life; This doctrine thou must abhor.


         Thirdly, Thou must hate his setting of thy feet in the way that leadeth
    to the ministration of death. And for this thou must consider to whom he sent
    thee, and also how unable that person was to deliver thee from thy Burden.


         He to whom thou was sent for ease, being by name Legality, is the Son of
    the Bond-woman which now is, and is in bondage with her children; and is in
    a mystery this Mount Sinai, which thou hast feared will fall on thy head. Now
    if she with her children are in bondage, how canst thou expect by them to be
    made free? This Legality therefore is not able to set thee free from thy
    Burden. No man was as yet ever rid of his Burden by him; no, nor ever is like
    to be: ye cannot be justified by the Works of the Law; for by the deeds of the
    Law no man living can be rid of his Burden: therefore, Mr Worldly Wiseman is
    an alien, and Mr Legality a cheat; and for his son Civility, notwithstanding
    his simpering looks, he is but a hypocrite and cannot help thee. Believe me,
    there is nothing in all this noise, that thou hast heard of this sottish man,
    but a design to beguile thee of thy Salvation, by turning thee from the way in
    which I had set thee. After this Evangelist called aloud to the Heavens for
    confirmation of what he had said; and with that there came words and fire out
    of the Mountain under which poor Christian stood, that made the hair of his
    flesh stand. The words were thus pronounced, As many as are the works of the
    Law are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one that
    continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do
    them.


         Now Christian looked for nothing but death, and began to cry out
    lamentably, even cursing the time in which he met with Mr Worldly Wiseman,
    still calling himself a thousand fools for hearkening to his counsel: he also
    was greatly ashamed to think that this Gentleman's arguments, flowing only
    from the flesh, should have that prevalency with him as to cause him to
    forsake the right way. This done, he applied himself again to Evangelist in
    words and sense as follows.


         Chr. Sir, what think you? Is there hopes? May I now go back and go up to
    the Wicket-gate? Shall I not be abandoned for this, and sent back from
    thence ashamed? I am sorry I have hearkened to this man's counsel: But may my
    sin be forgiven?


         Evan. Then said Evangelist to him, Thy sin is very great, for by it thou
    hast committed two evils: thou hast forsaken the way that is good, to tread in
    forbidden paths; yet will the man at the Gate receive thee, for he has
    goodwill for men; only, said he, take heed that thou turn not aside again,
    lest thou perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Then
    did Christian address himself to go back; and Evangelist, after he had kissed
    him, gave him one smile, and bid him God speed. So he went on with haste,
    neither spake he to any man by the way; nor if any man asked him, would he
    vouchsafe them an answer. He went like one that was all the while treading on
    forbidden ground, and could by no means think himself safe, till again he was
    got into the way which he left to follow Mr Worldly Wiseman's counsel. So in
    process of time Christian got up to the Gate. Now over the Gate there was
    written, Knock and it shall be opened unto you.


    He that will enter in must first without
    Stand knocking at the Garet, nor need he doubt
    That is a knocker but to enter in,
    For God can love him, and forgive his sin.


         He knocked therefore more than once or twice, saying,


    May I now enter here? Will he within
    Open to sorry me, though I have been
    An undeserving Rebel? Then shall I
    Not fail to sing his lasting praise on high.


         At last there came a grave person to the gate named Good-Will, who
    asked Who was there? and whence he came? and what he would have?


         Chr. Here is a poor burdened sinner. I come from the City of Destruction,
    but am going to Mount Zion, that I may be delivered from the wrath to come. I
    would therefore, Sir, since I am informed that by this Gate is the way
    thither, know if you are willing to let me in.


         Good-will. I am willing with all my heart, said he; and with that he
    opened the Gate.


         So when Christian was stepping in, the other gave him a pull. Then said
    Christian, What means that? The other told him, A little distance from this
    Gate, there is erected a strong Castle, of which Beelzebub is the Captain;
    from thence both he and they that are with him shoot arrows at those that come
    up to this Gate, if haply they may die before they can enter in. Then said
    Christian, I rejoice and tremble. So when he was got in, the man of the Gate
    asked him who directed him thither?


         Chr. Evangelist bid me come hither and knock (as I did); and he said that
    you, Sir, would tell me what I must do.


         Good-will. An open door is set before thee, and no man can shut it.


         Chr. Now I begin to reap the benefits of my hazards.


         Good-will. But how is it that you came alone?


         Chr. Because none of my Neighbors saw their danger, as I saw mine.


         Good-will. Did any of them know of your coming?


         Chr. Yes, my Wife and Children saw me at the first, and called after me
    to turn again; also some of my Neighbors stood crying and calling after me to
    return; but I put my fingers in my ears, and so came on my way.


         Good-will. But did none of them follow you, to persuade you to go back?


         Chr. Yes, both Obstinate and Pliable; but when they saw that they could
    not prevail, Obstinate went railing back, but Pliable came with me a little
    way.


         Good-will. But why did he not come through?


         Chr. We indeed came both together, until we came to the Slough of
    Dispond, into the which we also suddenly fell. And then was my Neighbor
    Pliable discouraged, and would not adventure further. Wherefore getting out
    again on that side next to his own house, he told me I should possess the
    brave country alone for him; so he went his way, and I came mine: he after
    Obstinate, and I to this Gate.


         Good-will. Then said Good-will, Alas, poor man, is the coelestial
    glory of so small esteem with him, that he counteth it not worth running the
    hazards of a few difficulties to obtain it?


         Chr. Truly, said Christian, I have said the truth of Pliable, and if I
    should also say all the truth of myself, it will appear there is no betterment
    'twixt him and myself. 'Tis true, he went back to his own house, but I also
    turned aside to go in the way of death, being persuaded thereto by the carnal
    arguments of one Mr Worldly Wiseman.


         Good-will. O, did he light upon you? What! he would have had you a
    sought for ease at the hands of Mr Legality. They are both of them a very
    cheat: But did you take his counsel?


         Chr. Yes, as far as I durst: I went to find out Mr Legality, until I
    thought that the Mountain that stands by his house would have fallen upon my
    head; wherefore there I was forced to stop.


         Good-will. That Mountain has been the death of many, and will be the
    death of many more; 'tis well you escaped being by it dashed in pieces.


         Chr. Why truly I do not know what had become of me there, had not
    Evangelist happily met me again, as I was musing in the midst of my dumps: but
    'twas God's mercy that he came to me again, for else I had never come hither.
    But now I am come, such a one as I am, more fit indeed for death by that
    Mountain than thus to stand talking with my Lord; but O, what a favour is this
    to me, that yet I am admitted entrance here.


         Good-will. We make no objections against any, notwithstanding all that
    they have done before they come hither, they in no wise are cast out; and
    therefore, good Christian, come a little way with me, and I will teach thee
    about the way thou must go. Look before thee; dost thou see this narrow way?
    That is the way thou must go; it was cast up by the Patriarchs, Prophets,
    Christ, and his Apostles; and it is as straight as a rule can make it: This is
    the way thou must go.


         Chr. But said Christian, Is there no turnings nor windings, by which a
    Stranger may lose the way?


         Good-will. Yes, there are many ways butt down upon this, and they are
    crooked and wide: But thus thou mayest distinguish the right from the wrong,
    the right only being straight and narrow.


         Then I saw in my Dream, that Christian asked him further, If he could not
    help him off with his Burden that was upon his back; for as yet he had not got
    rid thereof, nor could he by any means get it off without help.


         He told him, As to they Burden, be content to bear it, until thou comest
    to the place of Deliverance; for there it will fall from thy back itself.


         Then Christian began to gird up his loins, and to address himself to his
    Journey. So the other told him, That by that he was gone some distance from
    the Gate, he would come at the house of the Interpreter, at whose door he
    should knock, and he would shew him excellent things. Then Christian took his
    leave of his Friend, and he again bid him God speed.


         Then he went on till he came at the house of the Interpreter, where he
    knocked over and over; at last one came to the door, and asked Who was there?


         Chr. Sir, here is a Traveller, who was bid by an acquaintance of the good
    man of this house to call here for my profit; I would therefore speak with the
    Master of the house. So he called for the Master of the house, who after a
    little time came to Christian, and asked him what he would have?


         Chr. Sir, said Christian, I am a man that am come from the City of
    Destruction, and am going to the Mount Zion; and I was told by the Man that
    stands at the Gate at the head of this way, that if I called here, you would
    shew me excellent things, such as would be a help to me in my Journey.


         Inter. Then said the Interpreter, Come in, I will shew thee that which
    will be profitable to thee. So he commanded his man to light the Candle, and
    bid Christian follow him, so he had him into a private room, and bid his man
    open a door; the which when he had done, Christian saw the Picture of a very
    grave Person hang up against the wall; and this was the fashion of it. It had
    eyes lifted up to Heaven, the best of Books in his hand, the Law of Truth was
    written upon his lips, the World was behind his back. It stood as if it
    pleaded with men, and a Crown of Gold did hang over his head.


         Chr. Then said Christian, What means this?


         Inter. The Man whose Picture this is, is one of a thousand; he can beget
    children, travel in birth with children, and nurse them himself when they are
    born. And whereas thou seest him with his eyes lift up to Heaven, the best of
    Books in his hand, and the Law of Truth writ on his lips, it is to shew thee
    that his work is to know and unfold dark things to sinners; even as also thou
    seest him stand as if he pleaded with men; and whereas thou seest the World as
    cast behind him, and that a Crown hangs over his head, that is to shew thee
    that slighting and despising the things that are present, for the love that he
    hath to his Master's service, he is sure in the world that comes next to have
    Glory for his reward. Now, said the Interpreter, I have shewed thee this
    Picture first, because the Man whose Picture this is, is the only man whom the
    Lord of the place whither thou art going, hath authorized to be thy guide in
    all difficult places thou mayest with in the way; wherefore take good heed to
    what I have shewed thee, and bear well in thy mind what thou hast seen, lest
    in thy Journey thou meet with some that pretend to lead thee right, but their
    way goes down to death.


         Then he took him by the hand, and led him into a very large Parlour that
    was full of dust, because never swept; the which after he had reviewed a
    little while, the Interpreter called for a man to sweep. Now when he began to
    sweep, the dust began so abundantly to fly about, that Christian had almost
    therewith been choaked. Then said the Interpreter to a Damsel that stood by,
    Bring hither the Water, and sprinkle the Room; the which when she had done, it
    was swept and cleansed with pleasure.


         Chr. Then said Christian, What means this?


         Inter. The Interpreter answered, This parlour is the heart of a man that
    was never sanctified by the sweet Grace of the Gospel: the dust is his
    Original Sin and inward Corruptions, that have defiled the whole man. He that
    began to sweep at first, is the Law; but she that brought water, and did
    sprinkle it, is the Gospel. Now, whereas thou sawest that so soon as the first
    began to sweep, the dust did so fly about that the Room by him could not be
    cleansed, but that thou wast almost choaked therewith; this is to shew thee,
    that the Law, instead of cleansing the heart (by its working) from sin, doth
    revive, put strength into, and increase it in the soul, even as it doth
    discover and forbid it, for it doth not give power to subdue.


         Again, as thou sawest the Damsel sprinkle the room with Water, upon which
    it was cleansed with pleasure; this is to shew thee, that when the Gospel
    comes in the sweet and precious influences thereof to the heart, then I say,
    even as thou sawest the Damsel lay the dust by sprinkling the floor with
    Water, so is sin vanquished and subdued, and the soul made clean, through the
    faith of it, and consequently fit for the King of Glory to inhabit.


         I saw moreover in my Dream, that the Interpreter took him by the hand,
    and had him into a little room, where sat two little Children, each one in his
    chair. The name of the eldest was Passion, and the name of the other Patience.
    Passion seemed to be much discontent; but Patience was very quiet. Then
    Christian asked, What is the reason of the discontent of Passion? The
    Interpreter answered, The Governor of them would have him stay for his best
    things till the beginning of the next year; but he will have all now; but
    Patience is willing to wait.


         Then I saw that one came to Passion, and brought him a bag of treasure,
    and poured it down at his feet, the which he took up and rejoiced therein; and
    withal, laughed Patience to scorn. But I beheld but a while, and he had
    lavished all away, and had nothing left him but Rags.


         Chr. Then said Christian to the Interpreter, Expound this matter more
    fully to me.


         Inter. So he said, These two Lads are figures: Passion, of the men of
    this world; and Patience, of the men of that which is to come; for as here
    thou seest, Passion will have all now this year, that is to say, in this
    world; so are the men of this world: they must have all their good things now,
    they cannot stay till next year, that is, until the next world, for their
    portion of good. That proverb, A Bird in the Hand is worth two in the Bush, is
    of more authority with them than are all the Divine testimonies of the good of
    the world to come. But as thou sawest that he had quickly lavished all away,
    and had presently left him nothing but Rags; so will it be with all such men
    at the end of this world.


         Chr. Then said Christian, Now I see that Patience has the best wisdom,
    and that upon many accounts. 1. Because he stays for the best things. 2. And
    also because he will have the Glory of his, when the other has nothing but
    Rags.


         Inter. Nay, you may add another, to wit, the glory of the next world will
    never wear out; but these are suddenly gone, Therefore Passion had not so much
    reason to laugh at Patience, because he had his good things first, as Patience
    will have to laugh at Passion, because he had his best things last; for first
    must give place to last, because last must have his time to come: but last
    gives place to nothing; for there is not another to succeed. He therefore that
    hath his portion first, must needs have a time to spend it; but be that hath
    his portion last, must have it lastingly; therefore it is said of Dives, In
    thy lifetime thou receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil
    things; but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.


         Chr. Then I perceive 'tis not best to covet things that are now, but to
    wait for things to come.


         Inter. You say truth: For the things which are seen are Temporal; but the
    things that are not seen are Eternal. But though this be so, yet since things
    present and our fleshly appetite are such near neighbors one to another; and,
    again, because things to come and carnal sense are such strangers one to
    another; therefore it is that the first of these so suddenly fell into amity,
    and that distance is so continued between the second.


         Then I saw in my Dream that the Interpreter took Christian by the hand,
    and led him into a place where was a Fire burning against a wall, and one
    standing by it, always casting much Water upon it, to quench it; yet did the
    Fire burn higher and hotter.


         Then said Christian, What means this?


         The Interpreter answered, This Fire is the work of Grace that is wrought
    in the heart; he that casts Water upon it, to extinguish and put it out, is
    the Devil; but in that thou seest the Fire notwithstanding burn higher and
    hotter, thou shalt also see the reason of that. So he had him about to the
    backside of the wall, where he saw a man with a Vessel of Oil in his hand, of
    the which he did also continually cast (but secretly) into the Fire.


         Then said Christian, What means this?


         The Interpreter answered, This is Christ, who continually, with the Oil
    of his Grace, maintains the work already begun in the heart: by the means of
    which notwithstanding what the Devil can do, the souls of his people prove
    gracious still. And in that thou sawest that the man stood behind the wall to
    maintain the Fire, that is to teach thee that it is hard for the tempted to
    see how this work of Grace is maintained in the soul.


         I saw also that the Interpreter took him again by the hand, and led him
    into a pleasant place, where was builded a stately Palace, beautiful to
    behold; at the sight of which Christian was greatly delighted: He saw also
    upon the top thereof, certain persons walking, who were cloathed all in gold.


         Then said Christian, May we go in thither?


         Then the Interpreter took him, and led him up toward the door of the
    Palace; and behold, at the door stood a great company of men, as desirous to
    go in, but durst not. There also sat a man at a little distance from the door,
    at a table-side, with a Book and his Inkhorn before him, to take the name of
    him that should enter therein; He saw also, that in the door-way stood many
    men in armour to keep it, being resolved to do the men that would enter what
    hurt and mischief they could. Now was Christian somewhat in a maze. At last,
    when every man started back for fear of the armed men, Christian saw a man of
    a very stout countenance come up to the man that sat there to write, saying,
    Set down my name, Sir: the which when he had done, he saw the man draw his
    Sword, and put an Helmet upon his head, and rush toward the door upon the
    armed men, who laid upon him with deadly force; but the man, not at all
    discouraged, fell to cutting and hacking most fiercely. So after he had
    received and given many wounds to those that attempted to keep him out, he cut
    his way through them all, and pressed forward into the Palace, at which there
    was a pleasant voice heard from those that were within, even of those that
    walked upon the top of the Palace, saying,


    Come in, Come in;
    Eternal Glory thou shalt win.


         So he went in, and was cloathed with such garments as they. Then
    Christian smiled, and said, I think verily I know the meaning of this.


         Now, said Christian, let me go hence. Nay, stay, said the Interpreter,
    till I have shewed thee a little more, and after that thou shalt go on thy
    way. So he took him by the hand again, and led him into a very dark room,
    where there sat a man in an Iron Cage.


         Now the Man, to look on, seemed very sad; he sat with his eyes looking
    down to the ground, his hands folded together; and he sighed as if he would
    break his heart. Then said Christian, What means this? At which the
    Interpreter bid him talk with the man.


         Then said Christian to the Man, What art thou? The Man answered, I am
    what I was not once.


         Chr. What wast thou once?


         Man. The Man said, I was once a fair and flourishing Professor, both in
    mine own eyes, and also in the eyes of others; I once was, as I thought, fair
    for the Coelestial City, and had then even joy at the thoughts that I should
    get thither.


         Chr. Well, but what art thou now?


         Man. I am now a man of Despair, and am shut up in it, as in this Iron
    Cage. I cannot get out; O now I cannot.


         Chr. But how camest thou in this condition?


         Man. I left off to watch and be sober; I laid the reins upon the neck of
    my lusts; I sinned against the light of the Word and the goodness of God; I
    have grieved the Spirit, and he is gone; I tempted the Devil, and he is come
    to me; I have provoked God to anger, and he has left me; I have so hardened my
    heart, that I cannot repent.


         Then said Christian to the Interpreter, But are there no hopes for such a
    man as this? Ask him, said the Interpreter.


         Chr. Then said the Christian, Is there no hope, but you must be kept in
    the Iron Cage of Despair?


         Man. No, none at all.


         Chr. Why? the Son of the Blessed is very pitiful.


         Man. I have crucified him to myself afresh, I have despised his Person, I
    have despised his Righteousness, I have counted his Blood an unholy thing; I
    have done despite to the Spirit of Grace: Therefore I have shut myself out of
    all the Promises, and there now remains to me nothing but threatnings,
    dreadful threatnings, fearful threatnings of certain Judgment and fiery
    Indignation, which shall devour me as an Adversary.


         Chr. For what did you bring yourself into this condition?


         Man. For the Lusts, Pleasures, and Profits of this World; in the
    enjoyment of which I did then promise myself much delight; but now every one
    of those things also bite me, and gnaw me like a burning worm.


         Chr. But canst thou not now repent and turn?


         Man. God hath denied me repentance: his Word gives me no encouragement to
    believe; yea, himself hath shut me up in this Iron Cage; nor can all the men
    in the world let me out. O Eternity! Eternity! how shall I grapple with the
    misery that I must meet with in Eternity!


         Inter. Then said the Interpreter to Christian, Let this man's misery be
    remembred by thee, and be an everlasting caution to thee.


         Chr. Well, said Christian, this is fearful; God help me to watch and be
    sober, and to pray that I may shun the cause of this man's misery. Sir, is it
    not time for me to go on my way now?


         Inter. Tarry till I shall shew thee one thing more, and then thou shalt
    go thy way.


         So he took Christian by the hand again, and led him into a Chamber, where
    there was one rising out of bed; and as he put on his raiment, he shook and
    trembled. Then said Christian, Why doth this man thus tremble? The Interpreter
    then bid him tell to Christian the reason of his so doing. So he began and
    said, This night, as I was in my sleep, I dreamed, and behold the Heavens grew
    exceeding black; also it thundred and lightned in most fearful wise, that it
    put me into an agony; so I looked up in my Dream, and saw the Clouds rack at
    an unusual rate, upon which I heard a great sound of a Trumpet, and saw also a
    Man sit upon a Cloud, attended with the thousands of Heaven; they were all in
    flaming fire, also the Heavens were in a burning flame. I heard then a Voice
    saying, Arise ye dead, and come to Judgment; and with that the Rocks rent, the
    Graves opened, and the Dead that were therein came forth. Some of them were
    exceeding glad, and looked upward; and some sought to hide themselves under
    the Mountains Then I saw the Man that sat upon the Cloud open the Book, and
    bid the World draw near. Yet there was, by reason of a fierce flame which
    issued out and came from before him, a convenient distance betwixt him and
    them, as betwixt the Judge and the Prisoners at the bar. I heard it also
    proclaimed to them that attended on the Man that sat on the Cloud, Gather
    together the Tares, the Chaff, and Stubble, and cast them into the burning
    Lake. And with that, the bottomless pit opened, just whereabout I stood; out
    of the mouth of which there came in an abundant manner, smoke and coals of
    fire, with hideous noises. It was also said to the same persons, Gather my
    Wheat into the Garner. And with that I saw many catch'd up and carried away
    into the Clouds, but I was left behind. I also sought to hide myself, but I
    could not, for the Man that sat upon the Cloud still kept his eye upon me: my
    sins also came into my mind; and my Conscience did accuse me on every side.
    Upon this I awaked from my sleep.


         Chr. But what was it that made you so afraid of this sight?


         Man. Why, I thought that the day of Judgment was come, and that I was not
    ready for it: but this frighted me most, that the Angels gathered up several,
    and left me behind; also the pit of Hell opened her mouth just where I stood:
    my Conscience too afflicted me; and as I thought, the Judge had always his eye
    upon me, shewing indignation in his countenance.


         Then said the Interpreter to Christian, Hast thou considered all these
    things?


         Chr. Yes, and they put me in hope and fear.


         Inter. Well, keep all things so in thy mind that they may be as a Goad in
    thy sides, to prick thee forward in the way thou must go. Then Christian began
    to gird up his loins, and address himself to his Journey. Then said the
    Interpreter, The Comforter be always with thee, good Christian, to guide thee
    in the way that leads to the City. So Christian went on his way saying,


    Here I have seen things rare and profitable;
    Things pleasant, dreadful, things to make me stable
    In what I have begun to take in hand;
    Then let me think on them, and understand
    Wherefore they shew'd me was, and let me be
    Thankful, O good Interpreter, to thee.
