<p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">Then I saw a very great number of angels bring from the city glorious crowns; a crown for every saint with his name written thereon; and as Jesus called for the crowns, angels presented them to him, and the lovely Jesus, with his own right hand, placed the crowns on the heads of the saints.&nbsp; In the same manner, the angels brought the harps, and Jesus presented them also to the saints.&nbsp; The commanding angels first<b> </b>struck the note, and then every voice was raised in grateful, happy praise, and every hand skillfully swept over the strings of the harp, sending forth melodious music in rich and perfect strains.&nbsp; Then I saw Jesus lead the redeemed company to the gate of the city.&nbsp; He laid hold of the gate and swung it back on its glittering hinges, and bade the nations who had kept the truth to enter in.&nbsp; There was everything in the city to feast the eye.&nbsp; Rich glory they beheld everywhere.&nbsp; Then Jesus looked upon his redeemed saints; their countenances were radiant with glory; and as he fixed his loving eyes upon them, he said, with his rich, musical voice, I behold the travail of my soul, and am satisfied.&nbsp; This rich glory is yours to enjoy eternally.&nbsp; Your sorrows are ended.&nbsp; There shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain.&nbsp; I saw the redeemed host bow and cast their glittering crowns at the feet of Jesus, and then, as his lovely hand raised them up, they touched their golden harps, and filled all heaven with their music, and songs to the Lamb.</p>  
<p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">I then saw Jesus leading the redeemed host to the tree of life, and again we heard his lovely voice, richer than any music that ever fell on mortal ear, saying, The leaves of this tree are for the healing of the nations.&nbsp; Eat ye all of it.&nbsp; Upon the tree of life was most beautiful fruit, which the saints could partake of freely.&nbsp; There was a most glorious throne in the City, and from under the throne proceeded a pure river of water of life, as clear as crystal.&nbsp; On either side of this river of life was the tree of life.&nbsp; On the banks of the river were beautiful trees bearing fruit which was good for food.&nbsp; Language is altogether too feeble to attempt a description of heaven.&nbsp; As the scene rises before me I am lost in amazement; and carried away with the surpassing splendor and the excellent glory, I lay down the pen, and exclaim, O what love!&nbsp; What wondrous love!&nbsp; The most exalted language cannot describe the glory of heaven, nor the matchless depths of a Saviour's love.</p>
