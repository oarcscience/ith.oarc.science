<p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHAPTER 32</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">The Shaking</h3>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">I saw some with strong faith and agonizing cries, pleading with God.&nbsp; Their countenances were pale, and marked with deep anxiety, which expressed their internal struggle.&nbsp; There were firmness and great earnestness expressed in their countenances, while large drops of perspiration rose upon their foreheads, and fell.&nbsp; Now and then their faces would light up with the marks of God's approbation, and again the same solemn, earnest, anxious look settled upon them.</p>  
<p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">Evil angels crowded around them, pressing their darkness upon them, to shut out Jesus from their view, that their eyes might be drawn to the darkness that surrounded them, and they distrust God, and next murmur against him.&nbsp; Their only safety was in keeping their eyes directed upward.&nbsp; Angels were having the charge over the people of God, and as the poisonous atmosphere from these evil angels was pressed around these anxious ones, the angels, which had the charge over them, were continually wafting their wings over them to scatter the thick darkness that surrounded them.</p>  
<p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">Some, I saw, did not participate in this work of agonizing and pleading.&nbsp; They seemed indifferent and careless.&nbsp; They were not resisting the darkness around them, and it shut them in like a thick cloud.&nbsp; The angels of God left them, and went to the aid of those earnest, praying ones.&nbsp; I saw the angels of God hasten to the assistance of all those who were struggling with all their energies to resist those evil angels, and trying to help themselves by calling upon God with perseverance.&nbsp; But the angels left those who made no effort to help themselves, and I lost sight of them.</p>  
<p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">As these praying ones continued their earnest cries, at times a ray of light from Jesus came to them, and encouraged their hearts, and lighted up their countenances.</p>  
<p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">I asked the meaning of the shaking I had seen.&nbsp; I was shown that it would be caused by the straight testimony called forth by the counsel of the true Witness to the Laodiceans.&nbsp; It will have its effect upon the heart of the receiver of the testimony, and it will lead him to exalt the standard and pour forth the straight truth.&nbsp; This straight testimony some will not bear.&nbsp; They will rise up against it, and this will cause a shaking among God's people.</p>  
<p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">I saw that the testimony of the true Witness has not been half heeded.&nbsp; The solemn testimony upon which the destiny of the church hangs, has been lightly esteemed, if not entirely disregarded.&nbsp; This testimony must work deep repentance, and all that truly receive it, will obey it, and be purified.</p>  
<p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">Said the angel, List ye!&nbsp; Soon I heard a voice that sounded like many musical instruments, all sounding in perfect strains, sweet and harmonious.&nbsp; It surpassed any music I had ever heard.&nbsp; It seemed to be so full of mercy, compassion, and elevating, holy joy.&nbsp; It thrilled through my whole being.&nbsp; Said the angel, Look ye!&nbsp; My attention was then turned to the company I had seen before, who were mightily shaken.&nbsp; I was shown those whom I had before seen weeping, and praying with agony of spirit.&nbsp; I saw that the company of guardian angels around them had doubled, and they were clothed with an armor from their head to their feet.&nbsp; They moved in exact order, firm like a company of soldiers.&nbsp; Their countenances expressed the severe conflict which they had endured, the agonizing struggle they had passed through.&nbsp; Yet their features, marked with severe internal anguish, shone now with the light and glory of heaven.&nbsp; They had obtained the victory, and it called forth from them the deepest gratitude, and holy, sacred joy.</p>  
<p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">The numbers of this company had lessened.&nbsp; Some had been shaken out, and left by the way.&nbsp; The careless and indifferent who did not join with those who prized victory and salvation enough to agonize, persevere, and plead for it, did not obtain it, and they were left behind in darkness, and their numbers were immediately made up by others taking hold of the truth, and coming into the ranks.&nbsp; Still the evil angels pressed around them, but they could have no power over them.</p>  
<p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">I heard those clothed with the armor speak forth the truth in great power.&nbsp; It had effect.&nbsp; I saw those who had been bound; some wives had been bound by their husbands, and some children had been bound by their parents.&nbsp; The honest who had been held or prevented from hearing the truth, now eagerly laid hold of the truth spoken.&nbsp; All fear of their relatives was gone.&nbsp; The truth alone was exalted to them.&nbsp; It was dearer and more precious than life.&nbsp; They had been hungering and thirsting for truth.&nbsp; I asked what had made this great change.&nbsp; An angel answered, It is the latter rain; the refreshing from the presence of the Lord; the loud cry of the third angel.</p>  
<p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">Great power was with these chosen ones.&nbsp; Said the angel, Look ye!&nbsp; My attention was turned to the wicked, or unbelievers.&nbsp; They were all astir.&nbsp; The zeal and power with the people of God had aroused and enraged them.&nbsp; Confusion, confusion, was on every side.&nbsp; I saw measures taken against this company, who were having the power and light of God.&nbsp; Darkness thickened around them, yet there they stood, approved of God, and trusting in him.&nbsp; I saw them perplexed.&nbsp; Next I heard them crying unto God earnestly.&nbsp; Through the day and night their cry ceased not.&nbsp; I heard these words, Thy will, O God, be done!&nbsp; If it can glorify thy name, make a way of escape for thy people!&nbsp; Deliver us from the heathen round about us!&nbsp; They have appointed us unto death; but thine arm can bring salvation.&nbsp; These are all the words I can bring to mind.&nbsp; They seemed to have a deep sense of their unworthiness, and manifested entire submission to the will of God.&nbsp; Yet everyone, without an exception, was earnestly pleading, and wrestling like Jacob for deliverance.</p>  
<p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">Soon after they had commenced their earnest cry, the angels, in sympathy would have gone to their deliverance.&nbsp; But a tall, commanding angel suffered them not.&nbsp; Said he, The will of God is not yet fulfilled.&nbsp; They must drink of the cup.&nbsp; They must be baptized with the baptism.</p>  
<p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">Soon I heard the voice of God, which shook the heavens and the earth.&nbsp; There was a mighty earthquake.&nbsp; Buildings were shaken down, and fell on every side.&nbsp; I then heard a triumphant shout of victory, loud, musical and clear.&nbsp; I looked upon this company who, a short time before were in such distress and bondage.&nbsp; Their captivity was turned.&nbsp; A glorious light shone upon them.&nbsp; How beautiful they then looked.&nbsp; All weariness and marks of care were gone.&nbsp; Health and beauty were seen in every countenance.&nbsp; Their enemies, the heathen around them, fell like dead men.&nbsp; They could not endure the light that shone upon the delivered, holy ones.&nbsp; This light and glory remained upon them, until Jesus was seen in the clouds of heaven, and the faithful, tried company was changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, from glory to glory.&nbsp; And the graves were opened and the saints came forth, clothed with immortality, crying victory over death and the grave, and together with the living saints, were caught up to meet their Lord in the air; while the rich, musical shouts of glory and victory were upon every immortal tongue, and proceeding from every sanctified, holy lip.</p>
