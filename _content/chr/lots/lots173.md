### May 30.—ST. FELIX I., Pope and Martyr.

ST. FELIX was a Roman by birth, and succeeded St. Dionysius in the
government of the Church in 269. Paul of Samosata, the proud Bishop of
Antioch, to the guilt of many enormous crimes added that of heresy,
teaching that Christ was no more than a mere man, in whom the Divine
Word dwelt by its operation and as in its temple, with many other gross
errors concerning the capital mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation.
Three councils were held at Antioch to examine his cause, and in the
third, assembled in 269, being clearly convicted of heresy,

pride, and many scandalous crimes, he was excommunicated and deposed,
and Domnus was substituted in his place. As Paul still kept possession
of the episcopal house, our Saint had recourse to the Emperor Aurelian,
who, though a pagan, gave an order that the house should belong to him
to whom the bishops of Rome and Italy adjudged it. The persecution of
Aurelian breaking out, St. Felix, fearless of danger, strengthened the
weak, encouraged all, baptized the catechumens, and continued to exert
himself in converting infidels to the Faith. He himself obtained the
glory of martyrdom. He governed the Church five years, and passed to a
glorious eternity in 274.

**Reflection**.—The example of Our Saviour and of all His saints ought
to encourage us under all trials to suffer with patience and even with
joy. We shall soon begin to feel that it is sweet to tread in the steps
of a God-man, and shall find that if we courageously take up our
crosses, He will make them light by sharing the burden with us.
