### May 29.—ST. CYRIL, Martyr.

ST. CYRIL suffered while still a boy at Cæsarea in Cappadocia, during
the persecutions of the third century. He used to repeat the name of
Christ at all times, and confessed that the mere utterance of this name
moved him

strangely. He was beaten and reviled by his heathen father. But he bore
all this with joy, increasing in the strength of Christ, Who dwelt
within him, and drawing many of his own age to the imitation of his
heavenly life. When his father in his fury turned him out of doors, he
said he had lost little, and would receive a great recompense instead.

Soon after, he was brought before the magistrate on account of his
faith. No threats could make him show a sign of fear, and the judge,
pitying perhaps his tender years, offered him his freedom, assured him
of his father's forgiveness, and besought him to return to his home and
inheritance. But the blessed youth replied, "I left my home gladly, for
I have a greater and a better which is waiting for me." He was filled
with the same heavenly desires to the end. He was taken to the fires as
if for execution, and was then brought back and re-examined, but he only
protested against the cruel delay. Led out to die, he hurried on the
executioners, gazed unmoved at the flames which were kindled for him,
and expired, hastening, as he said, to his home.

**Reflection**.—Ask Our Lord to make all earthly joy insipid, and to
fill you with the constant desire of heaven. This desire will make labor
easy and suffering light. It will make you fervent and detached, and
bring you even here a foretaste of that eternal joy and peace to which
you are hastening.
