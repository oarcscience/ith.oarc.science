### September 22.—THE THEBAN LEGION.

THE Theban legion numbered more than six thousand men. They marched from
the East into Gaul, and proved their loyalty at once to their Emperor
and to their God. They were encamped near the Lake of Geneva, under the
Emperor Maximian, when they got orders to turn their swords against the
Christian population, and refused to obey. In his fury Maximian ordered
them to be decimated. The order was executed once and again, but they
endured this without a murmur or an effort to defend themselves. St.
Maurice, the chief captain in this legion of martyrs, encouraged the
rest to persevere and follow their comrades to heaven. "Know, O
Emperor," he said, "that we are your soldiers, but we are servants also
of the true God. In all things lawful we will most readily obey, but we
cannot stain our hands in this innocent blood. We, have seen our
comrades slain, and we rejoice at their honor, We have arms, but we
resist not, for we had rather die without shame than live by sin." As
the massacre began, these generous soldiers flung down their arms,
offered their necks to the sword, and suffered themselves to be
butchered in silence.

**Reflection**.—Thank God for every slight and injury yon have to bear.
An injury borne in meekness and silence is

a true victory. It is the proof that we are good soldiers of Jesus
Christ, disciples of that heavenly wisdom which is first pure, then
peaceable.
