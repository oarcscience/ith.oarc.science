### February 15.—STS. FAUSTINUS and JOVITA, Martyrs.

FAUSTINUS and Jovita were brothers, nobly born, and zealous professors
of the Christian religion, which they preached without fear in their
city of Brescia, while, the bishop of that place lay concealed during
the persecution. Their remarkable zeal excited the fury of the heathens
against them, and procured them a glorious death for their faith at
Brescia in Lombardy, under the Emperor Adrian. Julian, a heathen lord,
apprehended them: and the emperor himself, passing through Brescia, when
neither threats nor torments could shake their constancy, commanded them
to be beheaded. They seem to have suffered about the year 121. The city
of Brescia honors them as its chief patrons, possesses their relics, and
a very ancient church in that city bears their names.

**Reflection**.—The spirit of Christ is a spirit of martyrdom—at least
of mortification and penance. It is always the spirit of the cross. The
more we share in the suffering life of Christ, the greater share we
inherit in His spirit, and in the fruit of His death. To souls mortified
to their senses and disengaged from earthly things, God gives frequent
foretastes of the sweetness of eternal life, and the most ardent desires
of possessing Him in His

glory. This is the spirit of martyrdom, which entitles a Christian to a
happy resurrection and to the bliss of the life to come.
