### ST. GREGORY, Bishop.

ST. GREGORY was one of the principal senators of Autun, and continued
from the death of his wife a widower till the age of fifty-seven, et
which time, for his singular virtues, he was consecrated Bishop of
Langres, which see he governed with admirable prudence and zeal
thirty-three years, sanctifying his pastoral labors by the most profound
humility, assiduous prayer, and extraordinary abstinence and
mortification. An incredible number of infidels were converted by him
from idolatry, and worldly Christians from their disorders. He died
about the beginning of the year 541, but some days after the Epiphany.
Out of devotion to St. Benignus, he desired to be buried near that
Saint's tomb at Dijon; this was executed by his virtuous son Tetricus,
who succeeded him in his bishopric.
