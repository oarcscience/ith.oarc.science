### December 2.—ST. BIBIANA, Virgin, Martyr.

ST. BIBIANA was a native of Rome. Flavian, her father, was apprehended,
burned in the face with a hot iron, and banished to Aequapendente, where
he died of his wounds a few days after; and her mother, Dafrosa, was
some time after beheaded. Bibiana and her sister Demetria, after the
death of their parents, were stripped of all they had in the world and
suffered much from poverty. Apronianus, Governor of Rome, summoned them
to appear before him. Demetria, having made confession of her faith,
fell down and expired at the foot of the tribunal, in the presence of
the judge. Apronianus gave orders that

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bibiana should be
put into the hands of a wicked woman named Rufina, who was to bring her
to another way of thinking; but Bibiana, making prayer her shield,
remained invincible. Apronianus, enraged at the courage and perseverance
of a tender virgin, ordered her to be tied to a pillar and whipped with
scourges loaded with leaden plummets till she expired. The Saint
underwent this punishment cheerfully, and died in the hands of the
executioners.

**Reflection**.--Pray for a fidelity and patience like Bibiana's under
all trials, that neither convenience nor any worldly advantage may ever
prevail upon you to transgress your duty.
