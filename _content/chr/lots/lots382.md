### December 13.—ST. LUCY, Virgin, Martyr.

THE mother of St. Lucy suffered four years from an issue of blood, and
the help of man failed. St. Lucy reminded her mother that a woman in the
Gospel had been healed of the same disorder. "St. Agatha," she said,
"stands ever in the sight of Him for Whom she died. Only touch her
sepulchre with faith, and you will be healed." They spent the night
praying by the tomb, till, overcome by weariness, both fell asleep. St.
Agatha appeared in vision to St. Lucy, and calling her sister, foretold
her mother's recovery and her own martyrdom. That instant the cure was
affected; and in her gratitude the mother allowed her daughter to
distribute her wealth among the poor, and consecrate her virginity to
Christ. A young man to whom she had been promised in marriage accused
her as a Christian to the heathen; but Our Lord, by a special miracle,
saved from outrage this virgin whom He had chosen for His own. The fire
kindled around her did her no hurt. Then the sword was plunged into her
heart, and the promise made at the tomb of St. Agatha was fulfilled.

**Reflection**.—The Saints had to bear sufferings and. temptations
greater far than yours. How did they overcome them? By the love of
Christ. Nourish this pure love by meditating on the mysteries of
Christ's life; and, above all, by devotion to the Holy Eucharist, which
is the antidote against sin and the pledge of eternal life.
