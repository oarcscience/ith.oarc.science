### September 10.—ST. NICHOLAS OF TOLENTINO.

BORN in answer to the prayer of a holy mother, and vowed before his
birth to the service of God, Nicholas never lost his baptismal
innocence. His austerities were conspicuous even in the austere
Order—the Hermits of

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> St. Augustine—to
which he belonged, and to the remonstrances which were made by his
superiors he only replied, "How can I be said to fast, while every
morning at the altar I receive my God?" He conceived an ardent charity
for the Holy Souls, so near and yet so far from their Saviour; and often
after his Mass it was revealed to him that the souls for whom he had
offered the Holy Sacrifice had been admitted to the presence of God.
Amidst his loving labors for God and man, he was haunted by fear of his
own sinfulness. "The heavens," said he, "are not pure in the sight of
Him Whom I serve; how then shall I, a sinful man, stand before Him?" As
he pondered on these things, Mary, the Queen of all Saints, appeared
before him. "Fear not, Nicholas," she said, "all is well with you: my
Son bears you in His Heart, and I am your protection." Then his soul was
at rest; and he heard, we are told, the songs which the angels sing in
the presence of their Lord. He died September 10, 1310.

**Reflection**.—Would you die the death of the just? there is only one
way to secure the fulfilment of your wish. Live the life of the just.
For it is impossible that one who has been faithful to God in life
should make a bad or an unhappy end.
