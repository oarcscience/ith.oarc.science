### November 16.—ST. EDMUND OF CANTERBURY.

ST. EDMUND left his home at Abingdon, a boy of twelve years old, to
study at Oxford, and there protected himself against many grievous
temptations by a vow of chastity, and by espousing himself to Mary for
life. He was soon called to active public life, and as treasurer of the
diocese of Salisbury showed such charity to the poor that the dean said
he was rather the treasure than the treasurer of their church. In 1234
he was raised to the see of Canterbury, where he fearlessly defended the
rights of Church and State against the avarice and greed of Henry III.;
but finding himself unable to force that monarch to relinquish the
livings which he kept vacant for the benefit of the royal coffers,
Edmund retired into exile sooner than appear

to connive at so foul a wrong. After two years spent in solitude and
prayer, he went to his reward, and the miracles wrought at his tomb at
Pontigny were so numerous that he was canonized in 1246, within four
years of his death.

**Reflection**.—The Saints were tempted even more than ourselves; but
they stood where we fall, because they trusted to Mary, and not to
themselves.
