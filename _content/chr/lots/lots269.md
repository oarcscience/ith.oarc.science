### August 27.—ST. JOSEPH CALASANCTIUS.

ST. JOSEPH CALASANCTIUS was born in Arragon, in 1556. When only five
years old, he led a troop of children through the streets to find the
devil and kill him. He became a priest, and was engaged in various
reforms, when he heard a voice saying, "Go to Rome," and had a vision of
many children who were being taught by him and by a company of angels.
When he reached the Holy City, his heart was moved by the vice and
ignorance of the children of the poor. Their need mastered his humility,
and he founded the Order of Clerks Regular of the Pious Schools. He
himself provided all that was necessary for the education of the
children, receiving nothing from them in payment, and there were soon
about a thousand scholars of every rank under his care. Each lesson
began with prayer. Every half-hour devotion was renewed by acts of
faith, hope, and charity, and towards the end of school-time the
children were instructed in the Christian doctrine. They were then
escorted home by the masters, so as to escape all harm by the way. But
enemies arose against Joseph from among his own subjects. They accused
him to the Holy Office, and at the age of eighty-six he was led through
the streets to prison. At last the Order was reduced to a simple
congregation. It was not restored to its former privileges till after
the Saint's death. Yet he died full of hope. "My work," he said, "was
done solely for the love of God."

**Reflection**.—"My children," said the Curé of Ars, "I often think that
most of the Christians who are lost are lost for want of instruction;
they do not know their religion well."
