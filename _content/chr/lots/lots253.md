### August 11.—STS. TIBURTIUS and SUSANNA, Martyrs.

AGRESTIUS CHROMATIUS was vicar to the prefect of Rome, and had condemned
several martyrs in the reign of Carinus; and in the first years of
Diocletian, St. Tranquillinus, being brought before him, assured him
that, having been afflicted with the gout, he had recovered a perfect
state of health by being baptized. Chromatius was troubled with the same
distemper, and being convinced by this miracle of the truth of the
Gospel, sent for a priest, and, receiving the Sacrament of Baptism, was
freed from that corporal infirmity. Chromatius's son, Tiburtius, was
ordained subdeacon, and was soon after betrayed to the persecutors,
condemned to many torments, and at length beheaded on the Lavican Road,
three miles from Rome, where a church was afterward built. His father,
Chromatius, retiring into the country, lived there concealed, in the
fervent practice of all Christian virtues.

ST. SUSANNA was nobly born in Rome, and is said to have been niece to
Pope Caius. Having made a vow of virginity, she refused to marry, on
which account she was impeached as a Christian, and suffered with heroic
constancy a cruel martyrdom. St. Susanna suffered towards the beginning
of Diocletian's reign, about the year 295.

**Reflection**.—Sufferings were to the martyrs the most distinguishing
mercy, extraordinary graces, and sources of the greatest crowns and
glory. All afflictions which God sends are in like manner the greatest
mercies and blessings; they are the most precious talents to be improved
by us to the increasing of our love and affection to God, and the
exercise of the most heroic virtues of self-denial, patience, humility,
resignation, and penance.
