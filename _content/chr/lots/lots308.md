### October 2.—THE HOLY GUARDIAN ANGELS.

GOD does not abandon to mere chance any of His handiworks; by His
providence He is everywhere present; not a hair falls from the head or a
sparrow to the ground without His knowledge. Not content, however, with

yielding such familiar help in all things, not content with affording
that existence which He communicates and perpetuates through every
living being, He has charged His angels with the ministry of watching
and safeguarding every one of His creatures that behold not His face.
Kingdoms have their angels assigned to them, and men have their angels;
these latter it is whom religion designates as the Holy Guardian Angels.
Our Lord says in the Gospel, "Beware lest ye scandalize any of these
little ones, for their angels in heaven see the face of My Father." The
existence of Guardian Angels is, hence, a. dogma of the Christian faith:
this being so, what ought not our respect be for that sure and holy
intelligence that is ever present at our side; and how great should our
solicitude be, lest, by any act of ours, we offend those eyes which are
ever bent upon us in all our ways!

**Reflection**.—Ah! let us not give occasion, in the language of Holy
Scripture, to the angels of peace to weep bitterly.
