### December 7.—ST. AMBROSE, Bishop.

AMBROSE was of a noble family, and was governor of Milan in 374, when a
bishop was to be chosen for that great see. As the Arian heretics were
many and fierce, he was present to preserve order during the election.
Though only a catechumen, it was the will of God that he should himself
be chosen by acclamation; and, in spite of his utmost resistance, he was
baptized and consecrated. He was unwearied in every duty of a pastor,
full of sympathy and charity, gentle and condescending in things
indifferent, but inflexible in matters of principle. He showed his
fearless zeal in braving the anger of the Empress Justina, by resisting
and foiling her impious attempt to give one of the churches of Milan to
the Arians, and by rebuking and leading to penance the really great
Emperor Theodosius, who in a moment of irritation had punished most
cruelly a sedition of the inhabitants of Thessalonica. He was the friend
and consoler of St. Monica in all her sorrows, and in 387 he had the joy
of admitting to the Church her son, St. Augustine. St. Ambrose died in
397, full of years and of honors, and is revered by the Church of and as
one of her greatest doctors.

**Reflection**.—Whence came to St. Ambrose his grandeur of mind, his
clearness of insight, his intrepidity in maintaining the faith and
discipline of the Church? Whence but from his contempt of the world,
from his fearing God alone?
