### April 22.—ST. SOTER, Pope, Martyr.

ST. SOTER was raised to the papacy upon the death of St. Anicetus, in
173. By the sweetness of his discourses he comforted all persons with
the tenderness of a father, and assisted the indigent with liberal alms,
especially those who suffered for the faith. He liberally extended his
charities, according to the custom of his predecessors, to remote
churches, particularly to that of Corinth, to which he addressed an
excellent letter, as St. Dionysius of Corinth testifies in his letter of
thanks, who adds that his letter was found worthy to be read for their
edification on Sundays at their assemblies to celebrate the divine
mysteries, together with the letter of St. Clement, pope. St. Soter
vigorously opposed the heresy of Montanus, and governed the Church to
the year 177.
