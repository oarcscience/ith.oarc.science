### October 19.—ST. PETER OF ALCANTARA.

PETER, while still a youth, left his home at Alcantara in Spain, and
entered a convent of Discalced Franciscans. He rose quickly to high
posts in the Order, but his thirst for penance was still unappeased, and
in 1539, being then forty years old, he founded the first convent of the
"Strict Observance." The cells of the friars resembled graves rather
than dwelling-places. That of St. Peter himself was four feet and a half
in length, so that he could never lie down; he ate but once in three
days; his sack-cloth habit and a cloak were his only garments, and he
never covered his head or feet. In the bitter winter he would open the
door and window of his cell that, by closing them again, he might
experience some sensation of warmth. Amongst those whom he trained to
perfection was St. Teresa. He read her soul, approved of her spirit of
prayer, and strengthened her to carry out her reforms. St. Peter died,
with great joy, kneeling in prayer, October 18, 1562, at the age of
sixty-three.

**Reflection**.—If men do not go about barefoot now, nor undergo sharp
penances, as St. Peter did, there are many ways of trampling on the
world; and Our Lord teaches them when He finds the necessary courage.
