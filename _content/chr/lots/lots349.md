### November 11.—ST. MARTIN OF TOURS.

WHEN a mere boy, Martin became a Christian catechumen against his
parents' wish; and at fifteen was therefore seized by his father, a
pagan soldier, and enrolled in the army. One winter's day, when
stationed at Amiens, he met a beggar almost naked and frozen with cold.
Having no money, he cut his cloak in two and gave him the half. That
night he saw Our Lord clothed in the half cloak, and heard Him say to
the angels: "Martin, yet a catechumen, hath wrapped Me in this garment."
This decided him to be baptized, and shortly after he left the army. He
succeeded in converting his mother; but, being driven from his home by
the Arians, he took shelter with St. Hilary, and founded near Poitiers
the first monastery in France. In 372 he was made Bishop of Tours. His
flock, though Christian in name, was still pagan in heart. Unarmed and
attended only by his monks, Martin destroyed the heathen temples and
groves, and completed by his preaching and miracles the conversion of
the people, whence he is known as the Apostle of Gaul. His last

eleven years were spent in humble toil to atone for his faults, while
God made manifest by miracles the purity of his soul.

**Reflection**.—It was for Christ crucified that St. Martin worked. Are
you working for the same Lord?
