### July 6.—ST. GOAR, Priest.

ST. GOAR was born of an illustrious family, at Aquitaine. From his youth
he was noted for his earnest piety, and, having been raised to sacred
orders, he converted many sinners by the fervor of his preaching and the
force of his example. Wishing to serve God entirely unknown to the
world, he went over into Germany, and settling in the neighborhood of
Trier, he shut himself up in his cell, and arrived at such an eminent
degree of sanctity as to be esteemed the oracle and miracle of the whole
country. Sigebert, King of Austrasia, learning of the sanctity of Goar,
wished to have him made Bishop of Metz, and for that purpose summoned
him to court. The Saint, fearing the responsibilities of the office,
prayed that he might be excused. He was seized with a fever, and died in
575.
