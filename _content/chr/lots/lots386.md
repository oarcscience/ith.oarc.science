### December 17.—ST. OLYMPIAS, Widow.

ST. OLYMPIAS, the glory of the widows in the Eastern Church, was of a
noble and wealthy family. Left an orphan at a tender age, she was
brought up by Theodosia, sister of St. Amphilochius, a virtuous and
prudent woman. Olympias insensibly reflected the virtues of this
estimable woman. She married quite young, but her husband

dying within twenty days of their wedding, she modestly declined any
further offer for her hand, and resolved to consecrate her life to
prayer and other good works, and to devote her fortune to the poor.
Nectarius, Archbishop of Constantinople, had a high esteem for the
saintly widow, and made her a deaconess of his church, the duties of
which were to prepare the altar linen and to attend to other matters of
that sort. St. Chrysostom, who succeeded Nectarius, had no less respect
than his predecessor for Olympias, but refused to attend to the
distribution of her alms. Our Saint was one of the last to leave St.
Chrysostom when he went into banishment on the 20th of June, 404. After
his departure she suffered great persecution, and crowned a virtuous
life by a saintly death, about the year 410.

**Reflection**.—"Lay not up to yourselves treasures on earth, but in
heaven, where neither rust nor moth doth consume."
