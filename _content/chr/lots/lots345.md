### November 7.—ST. WILLIBRORD.

WILLIBRORD was born in Northumberland in 657, and when twenty years old
went to Ireland, to study under St. Egbert; twelve years later, he felt
drawn to convert the great pagan tribes who were hanging as a cloud over
the north of Europe. He went to Rome for the blessing of the Pope, and
with eleven companions reached Utrecht. The pagans would not accept the
religion of their

enemies, the Franks; and St. Willibrord could only labor in the track of
Pepin Heristal, converting the tribes whom Pepin subjugated. At Pepin's
urgent request, he again went to Rome, and was consecrated Archbishop of
Utrecht. He was stately and comely in person, frank and joyous, wise in
counsel, pleasant in speech, in every work of God strenuous and
unwearied. Multitudes were converted, and the Saint built churches and
appointed priests all over the land. He wrought many miracles, and bad
the gift of prophecy. He labored unceasingly as bishop for more than
fifty years, beloved alike of God and of man, and died full of days and
good works.

**Reflection**.—True zeal has its root in the love of God. It can never
be idle; it must labor, toil, be doing great things. It glows as fire;
it is, like fire, insatiable. See if this spirit be in you!
