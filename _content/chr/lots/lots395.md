### December 26.—ST. STEPHEN, First Martyr.

THERE is good reason to believe that St. Stephen was one of the
seventy-two disciples of our blessed Lord. After the Ascension he was
chosen one of the seven deacons. The ministry of the seven was very
fruitful; but Stephen especially, "full of grace and fortitude, did
great wonders and signs among the people." Many adversaries rose up to
dispute with him, but "they were not able to withstand the wisdom and
the spirit that spoke." At length he was brought before the Sanhedrim,
charged, like his divine Master, with blasphemy against Moses and
against God. He boldly upbraided the chief priests with their
hard-hearted resistance to the Holy Ghost and with the murder of the
"Just One." They were stung with anger, and gnashed their teeth against
him. But when, "filled with the Holy Ghost and looking up to heaven, he
cried out, 'Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of man standing
at the right hand of God,' they rushed upon him, and dragging him forth
without the city, they stoned him to death"

**Reflection**.—If ever you are tempted to resentment, pray from your
heart for him who has offended you.
