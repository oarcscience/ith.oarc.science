### October 25.—STS. CRISPIN and CRISPINIAN, Martyrs.

THESE two glorious martyrs came from Rome to preach the Faith in Gaul
toward the middle of the third century. Fixing their residence at
Soissons, they instructed many in the Faith of Christ, which they
preached publicly in the day, and at night they worked at making shoes,
though they are said to have been nobly born, and brothers. The infidels
listened to their instructions, and were astonished at the example of
their lives, especially of

their charity, disinterestedness, heavenly piety, and contempt of glory
and all earthly things; and the effect was the conversion of many to the
Christian faith. The brothers had continued their employment several
years when a complaint was lodged against them. The emperor, to gratify
their accusers and give way to his savage cruel, gave orders that they
should be convened before Biotin's Varus, the most implacable enemy of
the Christians. The martyrs were patient and constant under the most
cruel torments, and finished their course by the sword about the year
287.

**Reflection**.—Of how many may it be said that "they labor in vain,"
since God is not the end and purpose that inspires the labor?
