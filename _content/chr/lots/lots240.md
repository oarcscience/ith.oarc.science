### July 31.—ST. IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA.

ST. IGNATIUS was born at Loyola in Spain, in the year 1491. He served
his king as a courtier and a soldier till his thirtieth year. At that
age, being laid low by a wound, he received the call of divine grace to
leave the world. He embraced poverty and humiliation, that he might
become more like to Christ, and won others to join him in the service of
God. Prompted by their love for Jesus Christ, Ignatius and his
companions made a vow to go to the Holy Land, but war broke out, and
prevented the execution of their project. Then they turned to the Vicar
of Jesus Christ, and placed themselves under his obedience. This was the
beginning of the Society of Jesus. Our Lord promised St. Ignatius that
the precious heritage of His Passion should never fail his Society, a
heritage of contradictions and persecutions. St. Ignatius was cast into
prison at Salamanca, on a suspicion of heresy. To a friend who expressed
sympathy with him on account of his imprisonment, he replied, "It is a
sign that you have but little love of Christ in your heart, or you would
not deem it so hard a fate to be in chains for His sake. I declare to
you that all Salamanca does not contain as many fetters, manacles, and
chains as I long to wear for the love of Jesus Christ." St. Ignatius
went to his crown on the 31st July, 1556.

**Reflection**.—Ask St. Ignatius to obtain for you the grace to desire
ardently the greater glory of God, even though it may cost you much
suffering and humiliation.
