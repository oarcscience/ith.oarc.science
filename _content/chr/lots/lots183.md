### ST. CLAUDE, Archbishop.

THE province of Eastern Burgundy received great lustre from this
glorious Saint. He was born at Salins, about the year 603, and was both
the model and the oracle of the clergy of Besançon, when, upon the death
of Archbishop Gervaise, about the year 683, he was chosen to be his
successor. Fearing the obligations of that charge, he fled and hid
himself, but was discovered and compelled to take it upon him. During
seven years he acquitted himself of the pastoral functions with the zeal
and vigilance of an apostle; but finding then an opportunity of
resigning his see, which, out of humility and love of solitude, he had
always sought, he retired to the great monastery of St. Oyend, and there
took the monastic habit, in 690. Violence was used to oblige him soon
after to accept the abbatial dignity. Such was the sanctity of his life,
and his zeal in conducting his monks in the paths of evangelical
perfection, that he deserved to be compared to the Antonines and
Pachomiuses, and his monastery to those of ancient Egypt. Manual labor,
silence, prayer, reading of pious books, especially the Holy Bible,
fasting, watching, humility, obedience, poverty, mortification, and the
close union of their hearts with God, made up the whole occupation of
these fervent servants of God, and were the rich

patrimony which St. Claude left to his disciples. He died in 703.
