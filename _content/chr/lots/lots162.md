### May 21.—ST. HOSPITIUS, Recluse.

ST. HOSPITIUS shut himself up in the ruins of an old tower near
Villafranca, one league from Nice in Provence. He girded himself with a
heavy iron chain and lived on bread and dates only. During Lent he
redoubled his austerities, and, in order to conform his life more

closely to that of the anchorites of Egypt, ate nothing but roots. For
his great virtues Heaven honored him with the gifts of prophecy and of
miracles. He foretold the ravages which the Lombards would make in Gaul.
These barbarians, having come to the tower in which Hospitius lived, and
seeing the chain with which he was bound, mistook him for some criminal
who was there imprisoned. On questioning the Saint, he acknowledged that
he was a great sinner and unworthy to live. Whereupon one of the
soldiers lifted his sword to strike him; but God did not desert His
faithful servant: the soldier's arm stiffened and became numb, and it
was not until Hospitius made the sign of the cross over it that the man
recovered the use of it. The soldier embraced Christianity, renounced
the world, and passed the rest of his days in serving God. When our
Saint felt that his last hour was nearing, he took off his chain and
knelt in prayer for a long time. Then, stretching himself on a little
bank of earth, he calmly gave up his soul to God, on the 21st of May,
681.

**Reflection**.—If we do not love penitence for its own sake, let us
love it on account of our sins; for we should " work out our salvation
in fear and trembling."
