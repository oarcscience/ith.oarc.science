### December 8.—THE FEAST OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION.

ON this day, so dear to every Catholic heart, we celebrate, in the first
place, the moment in which Almighty God showed Mary, through the
distance of ages, to our first parents as the Virgin Mother of the
divine Redeemer, the woman destined to crush the head of the serpent.
And as by eternal decree she was miraculously exempt from all stain of
original sin, and endowed with

the richest treasures of grace and sanctity, it is meet that we should
honor her glorious prerogatives by this special feast of the Immaculate
Conception. We should join in spirit with the blessed in heaven, and
rejoice with our dear Mother, not only for her own sake, but for ours,
her children, who are partakers of her glory and happiness. Secondly, we
are called upon to celebrate that ever-memorable day, the 8th of
December, 1854, which raised the Immaculate Conception of Our Blessed
Lady from a pious belief to the dignity of a dogma of the Infallible
Church, causing universal joy among the faithful.

**Reflection**.—Let us repeat frequently these words applied by the
Church to the Blessed Virgin: "Thou art all fair, O Mary? and there is
not a spot in thee" (Cant. iv. 7).
