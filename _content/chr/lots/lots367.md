### November 28.—ST. JAMES OF LA MARCA OF ANCONA.

THE small town of Montbrandon, in the Marca of Ancona, gave birth to
this Saint. When young he was sent to the University of Perugia, where
his progress in learning soon qualified him to be chosen preceptor to a

young gentleman of Florence. Fearing that he might be ingulfed in the
whirlpool of world excesses, St. James applied himself to prayer and
recollection. When travelling near Assisium he went into the great
Church of the Portiuncula to pray, and being animated by the fervor of
the holy men who there served God, and by the example of their blessed
founder St. Francis, he determined to petition in that very place for
the habit of the Order. He began his spiritual war against the devil,
the world, and the flesh, with assiduous prayer and extraordinary fasts
and watchings. For forty years he never passed a day without taking the
discipline. Being chosen Archbishop of Milan, he fled, and could not be
prevailed on to accept the office. He wrought several miracles at Venice
and at other places, and raised from dangerous sicknesses the Duke of
Calabria and the King of Naples. The Saint died in the convent of the
Holy Trinity of his Order, near Naples, on the 28th of November, in the
year 1476, being ninety years old, seventy of which he had spent in a
religious state.
