### September 9.—ST. OMER, Bishop.

ST. OMER was born toward the close of the sixth century, in the
territory of Constance. His parents, who were noble and wealthy, gave
great attention to his education, but, above all, strove to inspire him
with a love for virtue. Upon the death of his mother he entered the
monastery of Luxen, whither he persuaded his father to follow him, after
having sold his worldly goods and distributed the proceeds among the
poor. The father and son made their religious profession together. The
humility, obedience, mildness, and devotion, together with the admirable
purity of manners, which shone forth in every action of St. Omer,
distinguished him among his saintly brethren, and he was soon called
from his solitude to take charge of the government of the Church in
Terouenne. The greater part of those living in his diocese were still
pagans, and even the few Christians were, through a scarcity of priests,
fallen into a sad corruption of manners The great and difficult work of
their conversion was reserved for St. Omer. The holy bishop applied
himself to his task with such zeal that in a short time his diocese
became one of the most flourishing in France. In his old age St. Omer
became blind, but that affliction did not lessen his pastoral concern
for his flock. He died in the odor of sanctity, while on a pastoral
visit to Wavre, in 670.
