### December 16.—ST. EUSEBIUS, Bishop.

ST. EUSEBIUS was born of a noble family, in the island of Sardinia,
where his father is said to have died in prison for the Faith. The
Saint's mother carried him and his sister, both infants, to Rome.
Eusebius having been ordained, served the Church of Vercelli with such
zeal that on the episcopal chair becoming vacant he was unanimously
chosen, by both clergy and people, to fill it. The holy bishop saw that
the best and first means to labor effectually for the edification and
sanctification of his people was to have a zealous clergy. He was at the
same time very careful to instruct his flock, and inspire them with the
maxims of the Gospel. The force of the truth which he preached, together
with his example, brought many sinners to a change of life. He
courageously fought against the heretics, who had him banished to
Scythopolis, end thence to Upper Thebais in Egypt, where he suffered so
grievously as to win, in some of the panegyrics in his praise, the title
of martyr. He died in the latter part of the year 371.

**Reflection**.—The routine of every-day, commonplace. duties is no
hindrance to a free intimacy with God. He will disclose His hidden ways
to you in proportion as you follow your vocation faithfully, whether in
the world or the cloister.
