### ST. MALACHI, Bishop.

DURING his childhood Malachi would often separate himself from his
companions to converse in prayer with God. At the age of twenty-five he
was ordained priest; his devotion and zeal led to his being consecrated
Bishop of Connor, and shortly afterwards he was made Archbishop of his
native city, Armagh. This see having by a longstanding abuse been held
as an heirloom in one family, it required on the part of the Saint no
little tact and firmness to allay the dissensions caused by his
election. One day, while St. Malachi was burying the dead, he was
laughed at by his sister. When she died, he said many Masses for her.
Some time afterwards, in a vision, he saw her, dressed in mourning,
standing in a churchyard, and saying that she had not tasted food for
thirty days. Remembering that it was just thirty days since he last
offered the Adorable Sacrifice for her, he began again to do so, and was

fifty-four, where he fain would have lived, in St. Bernard's monastery,
on the 2d of November, 1148.

**Reflection**.—Our Lord said to St. Gertrude, "God accepts every soul
you set free, as if you had redeemed him from captivity, and will reward
you in a fitting time for the benefit you have conferred."
