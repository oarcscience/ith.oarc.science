### ST. ALBINUS, Bishop.

ST. ALBINUS was of an ancient and noble family in Brittany, and from his
childhood was fervent in every exercise of piety. He ardently sighed
after the happiness which a devout soul finds in being perfectly
disengaged from all earthly things. Having embraced the monastic state
at Tintillant, near Augers, he shone a perfect model of virtue, living
as if in all things he had been without any will of his own; and his
soul seemed so perfectly governed by the spirit of Christ as to live
only for Him. At the age of thirty-five years he was chosen abbot, in
504, and twenty-five years afterwards Bishop of Angers. He everywhere
restored discipline, being inflamed with a holy zeal for the honor of
God. His dignity seemed to make no alteration either in his
mortifications or in the constant recollection of his soul. Honored by
all the world, even by kings, he was never affected with vanity.
Powerful in works and miracles, he looked upon himself as the most
unworthy and most unprofitable among the servants of God, and had no
other ambition than to appear such in the eyes of others as he was in
those of his own humility.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In the third
Council of Orleans, in 538, he procured the thirtieth canon of the
Council of Epaone to be revived, by which those are declared
excommunicated who presume to contract incestuous marriages in the first
or second degree of consanguinity or affinity. He died on the 1st of
March, in 549.

**Reflection**.—With whatever virtues a man may be endowed, he will
discover, if he considers himself attentively, a sufficient depth of
misery to afford cause for deep humility; but Jesus Christ says, "He
that humbleth himself shall be exalted."
