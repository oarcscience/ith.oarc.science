### March 15.—ST. ZACHARY, Pope.

ST. ZACHARY succeeded Gregory III., in 741, and was a man of singular
meekness and goodness. He loved the clergy and people of Rome to that
degree that he hazarded his life for them on occasion of the troubles
which Italy fell into by the rebellion of the Dukes of Spoleto and
Benevento against King Luitprand. Out of respect to his sanctity and
dignity, that king restored to the Church of Rome all the places which
belonged to it, and sent back the captives without ransom. The Lombards
were moved to tears at the devotion with which they heard him perform
the divine service. The zeal and prudence of this holy Pope appeared in
many wholesome regulations which he had made to reform or settle the
discipline and peace of several churches. St. Boniface, the Apostle of
Germany, wrote to him against a certain priest named Virgilius, that he
labored to sow the seeds of discord between him and Odilo, Duke of
Bavaria, and taught, besides, many errors. Zachary ordered that
Virgilius should be sent to Rome, that his doctrine might be examined.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It seems that he
cleared himself; for we find this same Virgilius soon after made Bishop
of Salzburg. Certain Venetian merchants having bought at Rome many
slaves to sell to the Moors in Africa, St. Zachary forbade such an
iniquitous traffic, and, paying the merchants their price, gave the
slaves their liberty. He adorned Rome with sacred buildings, and with
great foundations in favor of the poor and pilgrims, and gave every year
a considerable sum to furnish oil for the lamps in St. Peter's Church.
He died in 752, in the month of March.
