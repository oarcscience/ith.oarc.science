### June 15.—STS. VITUS, CRESCENTIA, and MODESTUS, Martyrs.

VITUS was a child nobly born, who had the happiness to instructed in the
Faith, and inspired with the most perfect sentiments of his religion, by
his Christian nurse, named Crescentia, and her faithful husband,
Modestus. His father, Hylas, was extremely incensed when he discovered
the child's invincible aversion to idolatry; and finding him not to be
overcome by stripes and such like chastisements, he delivered him up to
Valerian, the governor, who in vain tried all his arts to work him into
compliance with his father's will and the emperor's edicts. He escaped
out of their hands, and, together with Crescentia and Modestus, fled
into Italy. They there met with the crown of martyrdom in Lucania, in
the persecution of Diocletian. The heroic spirit of martyrdom which we
admire in St. Vitus was owing to the early impressions of piety which he
received from the lessons and example of a virtuous nurse. Of such
infinite importance is the choice of virtuous preceptors, nurses, and
servants about children.

**Reflection**.—What happiness for an infant to be formed naturally to
all virtue, and for the spirit of simplicity, meekness, goodness, and
piety to be moulded in its tender frame! Such a foundation being well
laid, further graces

are abundantly communicated, and a soul improves daily these seeds, and
rises to the height of Christian virtue often without experiencing
severe conflicts of the passions.
