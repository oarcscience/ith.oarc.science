### August 28.—ST. AUGUSTINE OF HIPPO.

ST. AUGUSTINE was born in 354, at Tagaste in Africa. He was brought up
in the Christian faith, but without receiving baptism. An ambitious
school-boy of brilliant talents and violent passions, he early lost both
his faith and his innocence. He persisted in his irregular life until he
was thirty-two. Being then at Milan professing rhetoric, he tells us
that the faith of his childhood had regained possession of his
intellect, but that he could not as yet resolve to break the chains of
evil habit. One day, a however, stung to the heart by the account of
some sudden conversions, be cried out, "The unlearned rise and storm
heaven, and we, with all our learning, for lack of heart lie wallowing
here." He then withdrew into a garden, when a long and terrible conflict
ensued. Suddenly a young fresh voice (he knows not whose) breaks in upon
his strife with the words, "Take and read;" and he lights upon the
passage beginning, "Walk honestly as in the day." The battle was won. He
received baptism, returned home, and gave all to the poor. At Hippo,
where he settled, he was consecrated bishop in 395. For thirty-five
years he was the centre of ecclesiastical life in Africa, and the
Church's mightiest champion against heresy; whilst his writings have
been everywhere accepted as one of the principal sources of devotional
thought and theological speculation. He died in 430.

**Reflection**.—Read the lives of the Saints, and you will ill find that
you are gradually creating a society about you to which in some measure
you will be forced to raise the standard of your daily life.
