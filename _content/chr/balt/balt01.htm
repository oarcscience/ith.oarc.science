He descended into hell: the third day He arose again from      the dead: He ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God, the      Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.      I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of Saints,      the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.      Amen.

On the Cross Christ really shed His blood and was really slain; in the Mass        there is no real shedding of blood nor real death, because Christ can die        no more; but the sacrifice of the Mass, through the separate consecration        of the bread and the wine, represents His death on the Cross. </p>     <h4>269.

Q. How does the sign of the Cross express the mystery of the Unity        and Trinity of God?</h4>
