<p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">OF THE THIRD COMING OF CHRIST</h3>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>The third coming, which is yet to be, will take place at the Judgment, or in the hour of death. The wherefore of this coming is the fitting time, the due cause, and the righteousness of the Judge.</p>  
<p>The time which is fitting for this coming is the hour of death, and the Last Judgment of all men. When God created the soul out of nothing and united it with the body, He set a fixed day and a fixed hour known only of Him, when it should have to give up temporal things and to appear in His presence.</p>  
<p>The due cause: for the soul must then account for every word spoken and for every deed done, before the Eternal Truth.</p>  
<p>The righteousness of the Judge, for it is to Christ that this Judgment and this Verdict belong; for He is the Son of Man and the Wisdom of the Father, and to this Wisdom all judgment is given, since all hearts, in heaven, and on earth, and in hell, are clear and open to It. And therefore these three points are the occasions of the general coming in the Day of Doom, and of the particular coming to each man in the hour of his death.</p>
