## CHAPTER I

 

### HOW WE ACHIEVE SUPERNATURAL SIGHT IN OUR INWARD WORKINGS

 

Now concerning the first point. Christ says: Behold. Whosoever wishes to
see in a supernatural way in his inward exercises must have three
things. The first is the light of Divine grace, and this in a more lofty
degree than that which we can experience in the outward and active life
without earnest inward diligence. The second thing is the casting out of
all distracting images and attachments from the heart; so that the man
may be free and imageless, released from all attachments, and empty of
all creatures. The third thing is a free turning of the will, with a
gathering together of all our powers, both bodily and ghostly, cleansed
from every inordinate love. Thereby the will flows forth into the unity
of God and into the unity of the mind; and thus the rational creature
may obtain and possess the most high unity of God in a supernatural
manner. For this God has created heaven and earth and everything; and
for this reason He became man, and taught us, and lived for our sake,
and has Himself become the Way to the unity. And He died in the bonds of
love, and has ascended and has opened to us that very unity, in which we
may possess eternal bliss.
