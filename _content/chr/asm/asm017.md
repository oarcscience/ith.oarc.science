## CHAPTER XIV

###  

### OF THE RENUNCIATION OF SELF WILL

 

From this obedience there springs the renunciation of one's own will and
one's own opinion, for none can submit his own will in all things to the
will of another, save the obedient man: though one may obey in outward
things and yet remain self-willed.

The forsaking of one's own will causes a man to live without preference
for either this or that, in doing or leaving undone, in those things
which are strange and special in the saints, in their precepts and in
their practice; but it makes him to live always according to the glory
and the commandments of God, and the will of his prelates, and in peace
with all men in his neighbourhood, so far as true prudence permits.

By renouncing self-will in doing, in leaving undone, and in suffering,
the material and occasion of pride are wholly cast out, and humility is
made perfect in the highest degree. And God becomes the Lord of the
man's whole will; and the man's will is so united with the will of God
that he can neither will nor desire in any other way. This man has put
off the old man, and has put on the new man, who is renewed and made
according to the dearest will of God. Of all such Christ says: Blessed
are the poor in spiritthat is to say, those who have renounced
self-will—for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. <span
