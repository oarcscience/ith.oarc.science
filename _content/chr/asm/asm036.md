## CHAPTER VI

 

### OF THE SECOND COMING OF OUR LORD IN THE INWARD MAN

 

The second way in which Christ comes inwardly, with a higher nobleness,
more after His likeness, with increased gifts, and with a greater
radiance, is a pouring forth of the riches of His Divine gifts into the
higher powers of the soul, whereby the spirit is strengthened,
enlightened, and enriched in many ways. This streaming of God into us
demands of us a flowing out and a flowing back, with all these riches,
into that same Source from which that torrent has flowed. And in this
torrent God gives to us and shows to us great wonders; but He asks back
from the soul all His gifts, increased beyond anything that any creature
could accomplish. This exercise and this way is more noble and more like
unto God than the first; and by it the three higher powers of the soul
are adorned.
