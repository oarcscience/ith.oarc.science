### HERE ENDS THE BOOK OF THE ADORNMENT OF THE SPIRITUAL MARRIAGE

 

 

# THE SPARKLING STONE

 

## PROLOGUE

 

The man who would live in the most perfect state of Holy Church must be
a good and zealous man; an inward and ghostly man; an uplifted and
God-seeing man; and an outflowing man to all in common. Whenever these
four things are together in a man, then his state is perfect; and
through the increase of grace he shall continually grow and progress in
all virtues, and in the knowledge of truth, before God and before all
men.
