## CHAPTER VII

###  

### OF THE BLESSED SACRAMENTS

###  

There is still another coming of Christ our Bridegroom, taking place
every day, with growth of grace and renewal of gifts. That is, when a
man receives some sacrament with a humble heart void of anything
contrary thereto. In this way he receives new gifts and more ample
grace, because of his humility and through the mysterious working of
Christ in the sacraments. Those things which are contrary to the
sacraments are unbelief in Baptism, a lack of repentance in Confession,
and approaching the Sacrament of the Altar in the state of mortal sin or
with an evil intention; and so on as regards the other sacraments. Those
who act thus receive no new grace; rather does their sinfulness
increase.

This is the other coming of Christ our Bridegroom, which is present with
us every day. We should consider it with a desiring heart, lest it
should not take place within us; for it is needful, if we are to remain
steadfast and to go forward in eternal life.
