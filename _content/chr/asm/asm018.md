## CHAPTER XV

 

### OF PATIENCE

 

From the renunciation of self-will springs patience; for none can be
perfectly patient in all things save the man who has subjected his own
will to the will of God, and also in all profitable and seemly things,
to the will of all other men.

Patience is a peaceful endurance of all things that may befall a man
either from God or from the creatures. Nothing can trouble the patient
man; neither the loss of earthly goods, of friends and kinsmen, nor
sickness, nor disgrace, nor life, nor death, nor purgatory, nor devil,
nor hell. For he has abandoned himself in perfect charity to the will of
God, and as he is not burdened by mortal sin, everything that God
imposes on him, in time and in eternity, is light to him. By this
patience a man is also adorned and armed against peevishness and sudden
wrath, and impatience in suffering; which often stir a man from within
and from without, and lay him open to many temptations.
