## CHAPTER V

 

### OF A THREE-FOLD COMING OF OUR LORD IN THE INWARD MAN

 

Even though the eye be clear and the sight keen, if there were no
loveworthy and desirable object, clearness of sight would neither please
nor profit a man. And this is why Christ shows to the enlightened eyes
of the understanding what they shall see, to wit, the inward coming of
Christ their Bridegroom.

Three ways of this special inward coming of God are found in those men
who exercise themselves with devotion in the inward life; and each of
these three comings raises a man to a higher degree and to a more inward
exercise.

The first coming of Christ in inward working drives and urges a man in
his inward feeling; it draws him with all his powers upwards to heaven,
and it calls him to unite himself with God. This driving and drawing we
feel in the heart, and in the unity of all the bodily powers, and
especially in the desirous power. For this coming stirs, and works in,
the lower part of man; for this must be wholly purged and adorned, and
inflamed and drawn inwards. This inward urge of God gives and takes,
makes rich and poor, brings weal and woe upon a man; it causes hope and
despair; it burns and it freezes. But no tongue can tell of those gifts
and works and contraries that here come to pass.

This coming with its working is parted into four degrees, each one
higher than the other, as we will show afterwards. And with it the lower
part of man is adorned in the inward life.
