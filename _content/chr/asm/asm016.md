## CHAPTER XIII

 

### OF OBEDIENCE

 

From this humility there springs obedience, for none can be inwardly
obedient save the humble man.

Obedience means an unassuming, submissive, and pliable humour, and a
will in readiness for all that is good. Obedience makes a man submit to
the biddings, the forbiddings, and the will of God; it subjects the
senses and the animal powers to the higher reason, so that a man may
live decently and reasonably. And it makes men submissive and obedient
to Holy Church, to the sacraments, to the prelates and their teaching,
to their commandments and their counsels, and to all the good customs
practised by Holy Christendom. It also makes a man ready and supple in
his intercourse with other men, in deed and counsel, in ghostly and
bodily business, with prudent discretion, according to the needs of
each.

And it casts out disobedience, that daughter of pride, more to be
abhorred than venom or poison. To be obedient in will and deed adorns
and enlarges and reveals the humility of a man. It makes peace in the
cloister. If it is in the prelate, as it ought to be, it will draw to
him all those whom he rules. It makes for peace and unanimity between
equals; and he who has it is loved by his superiors and by those who are
set over him; whilst by God he is advanced, and enriched with His gifts,
which are eternal.
