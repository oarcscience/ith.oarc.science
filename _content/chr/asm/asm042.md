## CHAPTER XII

 

### OF DEVOTION

 

Of this sensible love is born devotion to God and to His glory. For none
can have within his heart the hunger of devotion save him who bears
within himself a sensible love of God. Where the fire of love sends up
the flames of its desire to heaven, there is devotion. Devotion moves
and draws a man, both from without and from within, towards the service
of God. Devotion makes body and soul to blossom in nobility and worth
before God and before all men. Devotion is demanded of us by God in
every service which we ought to do to Him. Devotion purifies the body
and the soul of everything that can stop and hinder us. Devotion shows
and bestows the right way at blessedness.
