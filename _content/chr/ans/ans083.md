### <span id="v.L-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER L.

<span id="v.L-p2"></span>

<span id="v.L-p3"></span>The same love proceeds equally from Father and
Son.

<span id="v.L-p4"></span>

<span id="v.L-p5"></span>IT is, at any rate, clear to the rational man
that he does not remember himself or conceive of himself because he
loves himself, but he loves himself because he remembers himself and
conceives of himself; and that he could not love himself if he did not
remember and conceive of himself. For no object is loved without
remembrance or conception of it; while many things are retained in
memory and conceived of that are not loved.

<span id="v.L-p6"></span>It is evident, then, that the love of the
supreme Spirit proceeds from the fact that he remember himself and
conceives of himself (*se intelligit*). But if, by the memory of the
supreme Spirit, we understand the Father, and by his intelligence by
which he conceives of anything, the Son, it is manifest that the love of
the supreme Spirit proceeds equally from Father and Son.
