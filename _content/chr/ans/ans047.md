### <span id="v.XIV-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XIV.

<span id="v.XIV-p1"></span>

<span id="v.XIV-p2"></span>This Being is in all things, and throughout
all; and all derive existence from it and exist through and in it.

<span id="v.XIV-p3"></span>

<span id="v.XIV-p4"></span>BUT if this is true ‑‑ rather, since this
must be true, it follows that, where this Being is not, nothing is. It
is, then, everywhere, and throughout all things, and <span
id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span id="v.XIV-Page_60"></span>in all. But
seeing that it is manifestly absurd that as any created being can in no
wise exceed the immeasurabIeness of what creates and cherishes it, so
the creative and cherishing Being cannot, in anyway, exceed the sum of
the things it has created; it is clear that this Being itself, is what
supports and surpasses, includes and permeates all other things. If we
unite this truth with the truths already discovered, we find it is this
same Being which is in all and through all, and from which, and through
which, and in which, all exist.
