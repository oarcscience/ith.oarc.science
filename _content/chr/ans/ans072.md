### <span id="v.XXXIX-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XXXIX.

<span id="v.XXXIX-p2"></span>

<span id="v.XXXIX-p3"></span>This Word derives existence from the
supreme Spirit by birth.

<span id="v.XXXIX-p4"></span>

<span id="v.XXXIX-p5"></span>AND this truth, it seems, can be expressed
in no more familiar terms than when it is said to be the property of the
one, to be born of the other; and of the other, that the first is born
of him. For it is now clearly proved, that the Word of the supreme
Spirit does not derive existence from him, as do those beings which have
been created by him; but as Creator from Creator, supreme Being from
supreme Being. And, to dispose of this comparison with all brevity, it
is one and the same being which derives existence <span id="page_101">p.
101</span> <span id="v.XXXIX-Page_101"></span>from one and the same
being, and on such terms, that it in no wise derives existence, except
from that being.

<span id="v.XXXIX-p6"></span>Since it is evident, then, that the Word of
the supreme Spirit so derives existence from him alone, that it is
completely analogous to the offspring of a parent; and that it does not
derive existence from him, as if it were created by him, doubtless no
more fitting supposition can be entertained regarding its origin, than
that it derives existence from the supreme Spirit by birth (*nascendo*).

<span id="v.XXXIX-p7"></span>For, innumerable objects are unhesitatingly
said to be born of those things from which they derive existence,
although they possess no such likeness to those things of which they are
said to be born, as offspring to a parent. ‑‑ We say, for instance, that
the hair is born of the head, or the fruit of the tree, although the
hair does not resemble the head, nor the fruit the tree.

<span id="v.XXXIX-p8"></span>If, then, many objects of this sort are
without absurdity said to be born, so much the more fittingly may the
Word of the supreme Spirit be said to derive existence from him by
birth, the more perfect the resemblance it bears to him, like a child’s
to its parent, through deriving existence from him.
