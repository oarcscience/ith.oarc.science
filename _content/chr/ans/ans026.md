### <span id="iv.XX-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XX.

<span id="iv.XX-p1"></span>

<span id="iv.XX-p2"></span>He exists before all things and transcends
all things, even the eternal things. ‑‑Tbe eternity of God is present as
a whole with him; while other things have not yet that part of their
eternity which is still to be, and have no longer that part which is
past.

<span id="iv.XX-p3"></span>

<span id="iv.XX-p4"></span>HENCE, thou dost permeate and embrace all
things. Thou art before all, and dost transcend all. And, of a surety,
thou art before all; for before they were made, thou art. But how dost
thou transcend all? In what way dost thou transcend those beings which
will have no end? Is it because they cannot exist at all without thee;
while thou art in no wise less, if they should return to nothingness?
For so, in a certain sense, thou dost transcend them. Or, is it also
because they can be conceived to have an end; but thou by no means? For
so they actually have an end, in a certain sense; but thou, in no sense.
And certainly, what in no sense has an end transcends what is ended in
any sense. Or, in this way also dost thou transcend all things, even the
eternal, because thy eternity and theirs is present as a whole with
thee; while they have not yet that part of their eternity which is to
come, just as they no longer have that part which is past? For so thou
dost ever transcend them, since thou art ever present with thyself, and
since that to which they have not yet come is ever present with thee.
