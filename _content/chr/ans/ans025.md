### <span id="iv.XIX-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XIX.

<span id="iv.XIX-p2"></span>

<span id="iv.XIX-p3"></span>He does not exist in place or time, but all
things exist in him.

<span id="iv.XIX-p4"></span>

<span id="iv.XIX-p5"></span>BUT if through thine eternity thou hast
been, and art, and wilt be; and to have been is not to be destined to
be; and to be is not to have been, or to be destined to be; how does
thine eternity exist as a whole forever? Or is it true that nothing of
thy eternity passes away, so that it is not now; and that nothing of it
is destined to be, as if it were not yet?

<span id="iv.XIX-p6"></span>Thou wast not, then, yesterday, nor wilt
thou be to‑morrow; but yesterday and to‑day and to‑morrow thou art; or,
rather, neither yesterday nor to‑day nor to‑morrow thou art; but simply,
thou art, outside all time. For yesterday and to‑day and to‑morrow have
no existence, except in time; but thou, although nothing exists without
thee, nevertheless dost not exist in space or time, but all things exist
in thee. For nothing contains thee, but thou containest all.
