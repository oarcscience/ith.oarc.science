<p><a name="v.L-p5"></A>IT is, at any rate, clear to the rational man that he does not remember himself or conceive of himself because he loves himself, but he loves himself because he remembers himself and conceives of himself; and that he could not love himself if he did not remember and conceive of himself. For no object is loved without remembrance or conception of it; while many things are retained in memory and conceived of that are not loved.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.L-p6"></A>It is evident, then, that the love of the supreme Spirit proceeds from the fact that he remember himself and conceives of himself (<i>se intelligit</i>). But if, by the memory of the supreme Spirit, we understand the Father, and by his intelligence by which he conceives of anything, the Son, it is manifest that the love of the supreme Spirit proceeds equally from Father and Son.</p>
