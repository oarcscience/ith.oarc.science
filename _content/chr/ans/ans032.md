### <span id="iv.XXVI-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XXVI.

<span id="iv.XXVI-p1"></span>

<span id="iv.XXVI-p2"></span>Is this joy which the Lord promises made
full? ‑‑The blessed shall rejoice according as they shall love; and they
shall love according as they shall know.

<span id="iv.XXVI-p3"></span>

<span id="iv.XXVI-p4"></span>My God and my Lord, my hope and the joy of
my heart, speak unto my soul and tell me whether this is the joy of
which thou tellest us through thy Son: Ask and ye shall receive, that
your joy may be full (<span id="iv.XXVI-p4.1"></span>[John
16:24](../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#024)<span id="iv.XXVI-p4.1"></span>).
For I have found a joy that is full, and more than full. For when heart,
and mind, and soul, and all the man, are full of that joy, joy beyond
measure will still remain. Hence, not all of that joy shall enter into
those who rejoice; but they who rejoice shall wholly enter into that
joy.

<span id="iv.XXVI-p5"></span>Show me, O Lord, show thy servant in his
heart whether this is the joy into which thy servants shall enter, who
shall enter into the joy of their Lord. But that joy, surely, with which
thy chosen ones shall rejoice, eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither
has it entered into the heart of man (<span
id="iv.XXVI-p5.1"></span>[Isa. 64:4](../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004), [1
Cor. 2:9](../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009)<span id="iv.XXVI-p5.1"></span>).
Not yet, then, have I told or conceived, O Lord, how greatly those
blessed ones of thine shall rejoice. Doubtless they shall rejoice
according as they shall love; and they shall love according as they
shall know. How far they will know thee, Lord, then! and how much they
will love thee! Truly, eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither has it
entered into the heart of man in this life, how far they shall know
thee, and how much they shall love thee in that life.

<span id="iv.XXVI-p6"></span>I pray, O God, to know thee, to love thee,
that I may rejoice in thee. And if I cannot attain to full joy <span
id="page_33">p. 33</span> <span id="iv.XXVI-Page_33"></span>in this life
may I at least advance from day to day, until that joy shall come to the
full. Let the knowledge of thee advance in me here, and there be made
full. Let the love of thee increase, and there let it be full, that here
my joy may be great in hope, and there full in truth. Lord, through thy
Son thou dost command, nay, thou dost counsel us to ask; and thou dost
promise that we shall receive, that our joy may be full. I ask, O Lord,
as thou dost counsel through our wonderful Counsellor. I will receive
what thou dost promise by virtue of thy truth, that my joy may be full.
Faithful God, I ask. I will receive, that my joy may be full. Meanwhile,
let my mind meditate upon it; let my tongue speak of it. Let my heart
love it; let my mouth talk of it. Let my soul hunger for it; let my
flesh thirst for it; let my whole being desire it, until I enter into
thy joy, O Lord, who art the Three and the One God, blessed for ever and
ever. Amen.
