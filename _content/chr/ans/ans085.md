### <span id="v.LII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LII.

<span id="v.LII-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LII-p3"></span>This love is as great as the supreme Spirit
himself.

<span id="v.LII-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LII-p5"></span>HOW great, then, is this love of the supreme
Spirit, common as it is to Father and Son! But, if he loves himself as
much as he remembers and conceives of himself; and, moreover, remembers
and conceives of himself in as great a degree as that in which his
essence exists, since otherwise it cannot exist; undoubtedly his love is
as great as he himself is.
