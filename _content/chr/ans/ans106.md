### <span id="v.LXXIII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER LXXIII.

<span id="v.LXXIII-p2"></span>

<span id="v.LXXIII-p3"></span>No soul is unjustly deprived of the
supreme good, and every effort must be directed toward that good.

<span id="v.LXXIII-p4"></span>

<span id="v.LXXIII-p5"></span>BUT, which souls are unhesitatingly to be
judged as so loving that for the love of which they were created, that
they deserve to enjoy it at some time, and <span id="page_137">p.
137</span> <span id="v.LXXIII-Page_137"></span>which as so scorning it,
that they deserve ever to stand in need of it; or how and on what ground
those which it seems impossible to call either loving or scorning are
assigned to either eternal blessedness or misery, ‑‑ of all this I think
it certainly most difficult or even impossible for any mortal to reach
an understanding through discussion. But that no being is unjustly
deprived by the supremely great and supremely good Creator of that good
for which it was created, we ought most assuredly to believe. And toward
this good every man ought to strive, by loving and desiring it with all
his heart, and all his soul, and all his mind.
