<p><a name="iv.XXVI-p1"></A>  		  
<p><a name="iv.XXVI-p2"></A>Is this joy which the Lord promises made full? &#8209;&#8209;The blessed shall rejoice according as they shall love; and they shall love according as they shall know.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iv.XXVI-p3"></A>  		  
<p><a name="iv.XXVI-p4"></A>My God and my Lord, my hope and the joy of my heart, speak unto my soul and tell me whether this is the joy of which thou tellest us through thy Son: Ask and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full (<a name="iv.XXVI-p4.1"></A><a href="../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#024">John 16:24</a><a name="iv.XXVI-p4.1"></A>). For I have found a joy that is full, and more than full. For when heart, and mind, and soul, and all the man, are full of that joy, joy beyond measure will still remain. Hence, not all of that joy shall enter into 			 those who rejoice; but they who rejoice shall wholly enter into that joy.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iv.XXVI-p5"></A>Show me, O Lord, show thy servant in his heart whether this is the joy into which thy servants shall enter, who shall enter into the joy of their Lord. But that joy, surely, with which thy chosen ones shall rejoice, eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man (<a name="iv.XXVI-p5.1"></A><a href="../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004">Isa. 64:4</a>, <a href="../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009">1 Cor. 2:9</a><a name="iv.XXVI-p5.1"></A>). Not yet, then, have I told or conceived, O Lord, how greatly those blessed 			 ones of thine shall rejoice. Doubtless they shall rejoice according as they shall love; and they shall love according as they shall know. How far they will know thee, Lord, then! and how much they will love thee! Truly, eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man in this life, how far they shall know thee, and how much they shall love thee in that life.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iv.XXVI-p6"></A>I pray, O God, to know thee, to love thee, that I may rejoice in thee. And if I cannot attain to full joy <A NAME="page_33"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 33</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XXVI-Page_33"></A>in this life may I at least advance from day to day, until that joy shall come to the full. Let the knowledge of thee advance in me here, and there be made full. Let the love of thee increase, and there let it be full, that here my joy may be great in hope, and there full in truth. Lord, through thy Son thou dost command, nay, thou dost counsel us to ask; 			 and thou dost promise that we shall receive, that our joy may be full. I ask, O Lord, as thou dost counsel through our wonderful Counsellor. I will receive what thou dost promise by virtue of thy truth, that my joy may be full. Faithful God, I ask. I will receive, that my joy may be full. Meanwhile, let my mind meditate upon it; let my tongue speak of it. Let my heart love it; let my mouth talk of it. Let my soul hunger for it; let my flesh thirst for it; let my whole being desire it, until I 			 enter into thy joy, O Lord, who art the Three and the One God, blessed for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
