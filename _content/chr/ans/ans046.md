### <span id="v.XIII-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER XIII.

<span id="v.XIII-p1"></span>

<span id="v.XIII-p2"></span>As all things were created through the
supreme Being, so all live through it.

<span id="v.XIII-p3"></span>

<span id="v.XIII-p4"></span>IT is certain, then, that through the
supreme Nature whatever is not identical with it has been created. But
no rational mind can doubt that all creatures live and continue to
exist, so long as they do exist, by the sustenance afforded by that very
Being through whose creative act they are endowed with the existence
that they have. For, by a like course of reasoning to that by which it
has been gathered that all existing beings exist through some one being,
hence that being alone exists through itself, and others through another
than themselves ‑‑ by a like course of reasoning, I say, it can be
proved that whatever things live, live through some one being; hence
that being alone lives through itself, and others through another than
themselves.

<span id="v.XIII-p5"></span>But, since it cannot but be that those
things which have been created live through another, and that by which
they have been created lives through itself, necessarily, just as
nothing has been created except through the creative, present Being, so
nothing lives except through its preserving presence.
