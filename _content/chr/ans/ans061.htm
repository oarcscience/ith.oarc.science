<p><a name="v.XXVIII-p1"></A>  		  
<p><a name="v.XXVIII-p2"></A>This Spirit exists simply, and created beings are not comparable with him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.XXVIII-p3"></A>  		  
<p><a name="v.XXVIII-p4"></A>IT seems to follow, then, from the preceding considerations, that the Spirit which exists in so wonderfully singular and so singularly wonderful a way of its own is in some sort unique; while other beings which seem to be comparable with it are not so.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.XXVIII-p5"></A>For, by diligent attention it will be seen that that Spirit alone exists simply, and perfectly, and absolutely; while all other beings are almost non&#8209;existent, and hardly exist at all. For, seeing that of this Spirit, because of its immutable eternity, it can in no wise be said, in terms of any alteration, that it <i>was</i> or <i>will be</i>, but simply that it <i>is</i>; it is not now, by mutation, anything which it either was not at any time, or <A NAME="page_87"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 87</FONT></A> <a name="v.XXVIII-Page_87"></A>will not 			 be in the future. Nor does it fail to be now what it was, or will be, at any time; but, whatever it is, it is, once for all, and simultaneously, and interminably. Seeing, I say, that its existence is of this character, it is rightly said itself to exist simply, and absolutely, and perfectly.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.XXVIII-p6"></A>But since, on the other hand, all other beings, in accordance with some cause, have at some time been, or will be, by mutation, what they are not now; or, are what they were not, or will not be, at some time; and, since this former existence of theirs is no longer a fact; and that future existence is not yet a fact; and their existence in a transient, and most brief, and scarcely existing, present is hardly a fact &#8209;&#8209; since, then, they exist in such mutability, 			 it is not unreasonably denied that they exist simply, and perfectly, and absolutely; and it is asserted that they are almost nonexistent, that they scarcely exist at all.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.XXVIII-p7"></A>Again, since all beings, which are other than this Spirit himself, have come from non&#8209;existence to existence, not through themselves, but through another; and, since they return from existence to non&#8209;existence, so far as their own power is concerned, unless they are sustained through another being, is it consistent with their nature to exist simply, or perfectly, or absolutely, and not rather to be almost non&#8209;existent.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.XXVIII-p8"></A>And since the existence of this ineffable Spirit alone can in no way be conceived to have taken inception from non&#8209;existence, or to be capable of sustaining any deficiency rising from what is in nonexistence; and since, whatever he is himself, he is not through another than himself, that is, than what he is himself, ought not his existence alone to be conceived of as simple, and perfect, and absolute?</p> 		  <A NAME="page_88"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 88</FONT></A> <a name="v.XXVIII-Page_88"></A>   		  
<p><a name="v.XXVIII-p9"></A>But what is thus simply, and on every ground, solely perfect, simple, and absolute, this may very certainly be justly said to be in some sort unique. And, on the other hand, whatever is known to exist through a higher cause, and neither simply, nor perfectly, nor absolutely, but scarcely to exist, or to be almost non&#8209;existent &#8209;&#8209; this assuredly may be rightly said to be in some sort non&#8209;existent.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.XXVIII-p10"></A>According to this course of reasoning, then, the creative Spirit alone exists, and all creatures are nonexistent; yet, they are not wholly non&#8209;existent, because, through that Spirit which alone exists absolutely, they have been made something from nothing.</p>
