<p><a name="v.XXXVI-p3"></A>In how incomprehensible a way he expresses or knows the objects created by him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.XXXVI-p4"></A>  		  
<p><a name="v.XXXVI-p5"></A>HENCE, it may be most clearly comprehended that how this Spirit expresses, or how he knows the created world, cannot be comprehended by human knowledge. For none can doubt that created substances exist far differently in themselves than in our knowledge. For, in themselves they exist by virtue of their own being; while in our knowledge is not their being, but their likeness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.XXXVI-p6"></A>We conclude, then, that they exist more truly in themselves than in our knowledge, in the same degree <A NAME="page_98"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 98</FONT></A> <a name="v.XXXVI-Page_98"></A>in which they exist more truly anywhere by virtue of their own being, than by virtue of their likeness. Therefore, since this is also an established truth, that every created substance exists more truly in the Word, that is, in the intelligence of the Creator, than it does in itself, in the same degree in which the creative being exists more truly than the 			 created; how can the human mind comprehend of what kind is that expression and that knowledge, which is so much higher and truer than created substances; if our knowledge is as far surpassed by those substances as their likeness is removed from their being?</p>
