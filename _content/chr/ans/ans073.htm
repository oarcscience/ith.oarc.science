<p><a name="v.XL-p4"></A>  		  
<p><a name="v.XL-p5"></A>BUT if it is most properly said to be born, and is so like him of whom it is born, why should it be esteemed <i>like</i>, as a child is like his parent? why should it not rather be declared, that the Spirit is more truly a parent, and the Word his offspring, the more he <A NAME="page_102"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 102</FONT></A> <a name="v.XL-Page_102"></A>alone is sufficient to effect this birth, and the more what is born expresses his likeness? For, among other beings which we know bear the relations of parent and child, none so begets as to be 			 solely and without accessory, sufficient to the generation of offspring; and none is so begotten that without any admixture of unlikeness, it shows complete likeness to its parent.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.XL-p6"></A><a name="v.XL-p6.1"></A>If, then, the Word of the supreme Spirit so derives its complete existence from the being of that Spirit himself alone, and is so uniquely like him, that no child ever so completely derives existence from its parent, and none is so like its parent, certainly the relation of parent and offspring can be ascribed to no beings so consistently as to the supreme Spirit and his Word. Hence, it is his property to be most truly parent, and its to be most truly his 			 offspring.</p>
