<p><a name="iv.II-p1"></A>  		  
<p><a name="iv.II-p2"></A>Truly there is a God, although the fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iv.II-p3"></A>  		  
<p><a name="iv.II-p4"></A>AND so, Lord, do thou, who dost give understanding to faith, give me, so far as thou knowest it to be profitable, to understand that thou art as we believe; and that thou art that which we believe. And indeed, we believe that thou art a being than which nothing greater can be conceived. Or is there no such nature, since the fool hath said in his heart, there is no God? (<a name="iv.II-p4.1"></A><a href="../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001">Psalms 14:1</a><a name="iv.II-p4.1"></A>). But, at any rate, this very fool, when 			 he hears of this being of which I speak &#8209;&#8209;a being than which nothing greater can be conceived &#8209;&#8209;understands what he hears, and what he understands is in his understanding; although he does not understand it to exist.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iv.II-p5"></A>For, it is one thing for an object to be in the understanding, and another to understand that the object exists. When a painter first conceives of what he will afterwards perform, he has it in his understanding, but he does not yet understand it to be, because he has not yet performed it. But after he has made the painting, he both has it in his understanding, and he understands that it exists, because he has made it.</p> 		  <A NAME="page_7"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 7</FONT></A> <a name="iv.II-Page_7"></A>   		  
<p><a name="iv.II-p6"></A>Hence, even the fool is convinced that something exists in the understanding, at least, than which nothing greater can be conceived. For, when he hears of this, he understands it. And whatever is understood, exists in the understanding. And assuredly that, than which nothing greater can be conceived, cannot exist in the understanding alone. For, suppose it exists in the understanding alone: then it can be conceived to exist in reality; which is greater.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iv.II-p7"></A>Therefore, if that, than which nothing greater can be conceived, exists in the understanding alone, the very being, than which nothing greater can be conceived, is one, than which a greater can be conceived. But obviously this is impossible. Hence, there is no doubt that there exists a being, than which nothing greater can be conceived, and it exists both in the understanding and in reality.</p>
