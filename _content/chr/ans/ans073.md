### <span id="v.XL-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XL.

<span id="v.XL-p2"></span>

<span id="v.XL-p3"></span>He is most truly a parent, and that Word his
offspring.

<span id="v.XL-p4"></span>

<span id="v.XL-p5"></span>BUT if it is most properly said to be born,
and is so like him of whom it is born, why should it be esteemed *like*,
as a child is like his parent? why should it not rather be declared,
that the Spirit is more truly a parent, and the Word his offspring, the
more he <span id="page_102">p. 102</span> <span
id="v.XL-Page_102"></span>alone is sufficient to effect this birth, and
the more what is born expresses his likeness? For, among other beings
which we know bear the relations of parent and child, none so begets as
to be solely and without accessory, sufficient to the generation of
offspring; and none is so begotten that without any admixture of
unlikeness, it shows complete likeness to its parent.

<span id="v.XL-p6"></span><span id="v.XL-p6.1"></span>If, then, the Word
of the supreme Spirit so derives its complete existence from the being
of that Spirit himself alone, and is so uniquely like him, that no child
ever so completely derives existence from its parent, and none is so
like its parent, certainly the relation of parent and offspring can be
ascribed to no beings so consistently as to the supreme Spirit and his
Word. Hence, it is his property to be most truly parent, and its to be
most truly his offspring.
