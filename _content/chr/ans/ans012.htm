<p><a name="iv.VI-p3"></A>How God is sensible (<a name="iv.VI-p3.3"></A>sensibilis) although he is not a body. &#8209;&#8209;God is sensible, omnipotent, compassionate, passionless; for it is better to be these than not be. He who in any way knows, is not improperly said in some sort to feel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iv.VI-p4"></A>  		  
<p><a name="iv.VI-p5"></A>BUT, although it is better for thee to be sensible, omnipotent, compassionate, passionless, than not to be these things; how art thou sensible, if thou art not a body; or omnipotent, if thou hast not all powers; or at once compassionate and passionless? For, if only corporeal things are sensible, since the senses encompass a body and are in a body, how art thou sensible, although thou art not a body, but a supreme Spirit, who is superior to body? But, if feeling is 			 only cognition, or for the sake of cognition, &#8209;&#8209;for he who feels obtains knowledge in accordance with the proper functions of his senses; as through sight, of colors; through taste, of flavors, &#8209;&#8209;whatever in any way cognises is not inappropriately said, in some sort, to feel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iv.VI-p6"></A>Therefore, O Lord, although thou art not a body yet thou art truly sensible in the highest degree in respect of this, that thou dost cognise all things in the highest degree; and not as an animal cognises, through a corporeal sense.</p>
