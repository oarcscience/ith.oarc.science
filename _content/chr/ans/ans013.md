### <span id="iv.VII-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER VII.

<span id="iv.VII-p1"></span>

<span id="iv.VII-p2"></span>How he is omnipotent, although there are
many things of which he is not capable. ‑‑To be capable of being
corrupted, or of lying, is not power, but impotence. God can do nothing
by virtue of impotence, and nothing has power against him.

<span id="iv.VII-p3"></span>

<span id="iv.VII-p4"></span>BUT how art thou omnipotent, if thou art not
capable of all things? Or, if thou canst not be corrupted, and canst not
lie, nor make what is true, false ‑‑as, for example, if thou shouldst
make what has been done not to have been done, and the like. ‑‑how art
thou capable of all things? Or else to be capable of these things is not
power, but impotence. For, he who is capable of these things is capable
of what is not for his good, and of what he ought not to do; and the
more capable of them he is, the more power have adversity and perversity
against him; and the less has he himself against these.

<span id="iv.VII-p5"></span>He, then, who is thus capable is so not by
power, but by impotence. For, he is not said to be able because he is
able of himself, but because his impotence gives something else power
over him. Or, by a figure of speech, just as many words are improperly
applied, as when we use “to be” for “not to be,” and “to do” for what is
really not to do,“or to do nothing.” For, often we say to a man who
denies the existence of something: “It is as you say it to be,” though
it might seem more proper to say, “It is not, as you say it is not.” In
the same way, we say, “This man sits just as that man does,” or, “This
man rests just as that man does”; although to sit is not to do anything,
and to rest is to do nothing.

<span id="iv.VII-p6"></span>So, then, when one is said to have the power
of <span id="page_12">p. 12</span> <span
id="iv.VII-Page_12"></span>doing or experiencing what is not for his
good, or what he ought not to do, impotence is understood in the word
power. For, the more he possesses this power, the more powerful are
adversity and perversity against him, and the more powerless is he
against them.

<span id="iv.VII-p7"></span>Therefore, O Lord, our God, the more truly
art thou omnipotent, since thou art capable of nothing through
impotence, and nothing has power against thee.

<span id="iv.VII-p8"></span>
