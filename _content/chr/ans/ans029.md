### <span id="iv.XXIII-p1.1"></span>CHAPTER XXIII.

<span id="iv.XXIII-p2"></span>

<span id="iv.XXIII-p3"></span>This good is equally Father, and Son, and
Holy Spirit. And this is a single, necessary Being, which is every good,
and wholly good, and the only good. ‑‑Since the Word is true, and is
truth itself, there is nothing in the Father, who utters it, which is
not accomplished in the Word by which he expresses himself. Neither is
the love which proceeds from Father and Son unequal to the Father or the
Son, for Father and Son love themselves and one another in the same
degree in which what they are is good. Of supreme simplicity nothing can
be born, and from it nothing can proceed, except that which is this, of
which it is born, or from which it proceeds.

<span id="iv.XXIII-p4"></span>

<span id="iv.XXIII-p5"></span>THIS good thou art, thou, God the Father;
this is thy Word, that is, thy Son. For nothing, other than what thou
art, or greater or less than thou, can be in the Word by which thou dost
express thyself; for the Word is true, as thou art truthful. And, hence,
it is truth itself, just as thou art; no other truth than thou; and thou
art of so simple a nature, that of thee nothing can be born other than
what thou art. This very good is the one love common to thee and to thy
Son, that is, the Holy Spirit proceeding from both. For this love is not
unequal to thee or to thy Son; seeing that thou dost love thyself and
him, and he, thee and himself, to the whole extent of thy being and his.
Nor is there aught else proceeding from <span id="page_28">p. 28</span>
<span id="iv.XXIII-Page_28"></span>thee and from him, which is not
unequal to thee and to him. Nor can anything proceed from the supreme
simplicity, other than what this, from which it proceeds, is.

<span id="iv.XXIII-p6"></span>But what each is, separately, this is all
the Trinity at once, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; seeing that each
separately is none other than the supremely simple unity, and the
supremely unitary simplicity which can neither be multiplied nor varied.
Moreover, there is a single necessary Being. Now, this is that single,
necessary Being, in which is every good; nay, which is every good, and a
single entire good, and the only good.
