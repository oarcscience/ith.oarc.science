<H3 ALIGN="center">III.&#8212;SOME TYPICAL EXTRACTS.</H3>

<P>UNDER the first two headings readers have been made acquainted with all those pieces from the Mand&aelig;an John-Book that can be held to have in any sense a historic intention. To these are now added a few extracts of such specimens of the rest of the contents as do not require a commentary.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will begin with 'The Fisher of Souls' tractate from the John-Book. It seems to me to throw great light on the symbolic phrase of the gospels, indeed to give it a background, and not to be explained in reverse order as the Mand&aelig;an expansion of an isolated Christian expression.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A FISHER am I, a Fisher who elect is among fishers. A Fisher am I who among the fishers is chosen, the Head of all catchers of fish. I know the shallows of the waters, the inner . . . and the . . . I fathom; I come to the net-grounds, to the shallows and all fishing-spots, and search the marsh in the dark all over. My boat is not cut off [from the others] and I shall not be stopped in the night.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the fish<A NAME="page_71_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_71_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> in (? on) the dike. I pressed forward on the way with a . . . that was not of iron. I covered (?) the . . . which was for us an obstruction. Aside did I push the swimmers

who hinder Life's way. On my head I set up a . . . in whose shadow the fish sit. The fisher-trident which I have in my hand, is instead a <I>margn&#257;</I> select, a staff of pure water, at whose sight tremble the fishers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit in a boat of glory and come into this world (Tibil) of the fleeting. I come to the water's surface; thither to the surface of the water I drew, and I drew to the crossing's surface. I come in a . . . , in slow, steady course. The water by my boat is not ruffled, and no sound of my boat is heard. Before me stands Hibil (Abel), at my side Shitil (Seth) of sweet name is to be seen, close by me, close in front of me, An&#333;sh (Enoch) sits and proclaims.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say: "O Father, Good Fisher, hallo! O Fisher of loveable name!"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by me, close near my boat, I hear the uproar (?) of the fishers, the fishers who eat fish,<A NAME="page_72_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_72_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> and their stench rushes on me,&#8212;the uproar of the fishers and the uproar of their mongers who revile and curse one another. Everyone accuses the other. The buyer says to the fisher: "[Take back?] thy fish! They are stinking already, and no one wants to buy them off of me. Thou makest the catch far out at sea,<A NAME="page_72_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_72_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> so that loss falls on the buyer."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereon speaks the fisher and makes the man, his customer, hear: "A curse on thee, a curse on thy buyers, a curse on thy bell,<A NAME="page_72_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_72_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> a curse on thy boat for not filling up. Thou hast brought no salt and sprinkled it over thy fish which thou boughtest, so that the fish of thy boat will not be stinking and thou then canst sell for hard cash. Next, hast thou no meal and no dates brought, no salt . . . hast thou brought. If then thou comest with empty hands, one who is of fair favour has no dealing with thee. Go, go, thou godless [fellow], buy not from us to do business with thy fraudulent scales. Thou holdest them down to buy at false weight, [then in selling] keepest them up with thy elbow and gettest ten for five. Now does thy buying flee away, and thy buyer, and is as though it never had been. Thou dost complain of the . . . of men and dost cherish no noble thought."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Chief Fisher, the Head of the race of the Living, the highest of all catchers of fish, heard this, he said to him (? An&#333;sh): "Bring me my . . . , hand me the <I>squbr&#257;</I>,<A NAME="page_73_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_73_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> that I may make a call sound forth into the marsh, that I may warn the fish of the depths and scare away the foul-smelling birds that pursue after my fish. I will catch the great <I>sidm&#257;</I>,<A NAME="page_73_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_73_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> and tear off his wings on the spot. I will take from him * * * and will blow into my <I>squbr&#257;</I>. A true <I>squbr&#257;</I> is it, so that the water may not mix with pitch."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fishers heard the call, their heart fell down from its stay. One calls to the other and speaks to him: "Go into thy inner ground. For there is the call of the Fisher, the Fisher who eats no fish. His voice is not like that of a fisher, his <I>squbr&#257;</I> not like our <I>squbr&#257;</I>. His voice is not like our voice, his discourse not like to this world."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fishers stand there; they seek not shelter in their inner ground. As the fishers stand there and are thinking it over, the Fisher came swiftly upon them; he opened the cast-net, divided ... . He cast them bound into the ... . He tied them up with knots. They speak to him: "Free us from our bonds, so that thy fish may not leap up to our boat. We catch not those who name thy Name."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fishers thus spake to me, I smote them with a club made of iron. I bound their traders on the shore which lends not . . . (?). I roped them with ropes of bast and broke up their ships * * * * . I burnt up the whole of their netting and the . . . which holds the nets together. I threw chains round them and hung them up aft on my ship's stern. I made them take an oath, took from them their mystery, in order that they may not catch the good fish,&#8212;that they may not steal them from me, stick them on a cane, hang them up,<A NAME="page_73_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_73_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> I cut them in pieces and throw them into baskets (?) with laurel and aloe. They (the fishers) are laid low and cannot rise up. The nets ... ..., and they no longer stab the fisher-trident into the Jordan. They do not cut off * * * * * * and stand not in the river-lands

<A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A>

and make not their catch in the shallows. They cast not the cast-net therein and take not . . . and aloe.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spake to those who eat the . . . of the fish whose name is eel. They eat the eel and the . . . , which stands upright on its forefeet. They eat the ... ... ... ... . I bound them in the marshes of Deception, and they were caught and were tied up. Water from the Ulai they drink not and know not the way to the Kshash river.<A NAME="page_74_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_74_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> I bound them fast in their ships, and threw out my ropes to the good ones. To them I speak: "Draw your boat up here, so that it runs not into the dike."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Chief of the fish-catchers thus spake, the fishers made answer unto him and said; "Blessed be thou, a Fisher, and blessed be thy boat and thy bark. How fair is thy cast-net, how fair the yarn that is in it. Fair is thy cord and thy lacing, thou who art not like the fishers of this world. On thy meshes are no shell-fish, and thy trident catches no fish. Whence art thou come hither? Tell us! We will be thy hired servants. We will bake and stir about broth and bring it before thee. Eat, and the crumbs which fall from thy hand,&#8212;these will we eat and therewith be filled."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I made answer unto them: "O ye fishers, who lap up your filth, no fisher am I who fishes for fish, and I was not formed for an eater of filth. A Fisher am I of souls who bear witness to Life. A Poor Fisher am I who calls to the souls, collects them together and gives them instruction. He calls to them and bids them come and gather together unto him. He says unto them: If ye . . . come, ye shall be saved from the foul-smelling birds I will save my friends, bring them on high and in my ship make them stand upright. I will clothe them with vestures of glory and with precious light will enwrap them. I will put a crown of &aelig;ther upon them and what else for them the Greatness erects on their head. Then sit they on thrones and in precious light do they glisten. I bear them thither and raise them aloft; but ye Seven shall stay here behind. The portion of filth and of filthy

doings shall be your portion. On the day when the Light ascends, the Darkness will return to its region. I and my disciples will ascend and behold the Light's region."</P>

<P ALIGN="center">THE LIGHT-SHIP OF THE FISHER (&sect; 37).</P>

<P ALIGN="center">In the Name of Great Life may hallowed Light be glorified.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A FISHER am I of Great Life, a Fisher am I of the Mighty; a Fisher am I of Great Life, an Envoy whom Life has sent. It (Life) spake unto me: "Go, catch fish who do not eat filth, fish who do not eat water-fennel and reek not of foul-smelling fennel. They do not come nigh to devour bad dates and get caught in the nets of the marsh."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life knotted for me a noose and built for me a ship that fades not,&#8212;a ship whose wings are of glory, that sails along as in flight, and from it the wings will not be torn off. 'Tis a well-furnished ship and sails on in the heart of the heaven. Its ropes are ropes of glory and a rudder of Truth is there to it. Sunday takes hold of the pole, Life's Son seized the rudder. They draw thither to the shek&#299;nahs and dispense Light among the treasures. Thrones in them (<I>sc</I>. the shek&#299;nahs) they set up, and long drawn out come the Jordans upon them. On the bow are set lamps that in the wildest of tempests are not put out. All ships that sight me, make obeisance submissively to me. Submissively they make me obeisance and come to show their devotion unto me.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bows stands the Fisher and delivers wondrous discourses. [There are] lamps [there], whose wicks shift not hither and thither, and a . . . is not by him. He wears no ring of Deception, and with white robes is he clad. He calls to the fish of the sea and speaks to them: "Give heed to yourselves in the world! Beware of the foul-smelling birds who are above you. If you give heed to yourselves my brothers, I will for you

We will make thee familiar with the fishers; be our great partner and take a share as we [do]. Grant us a share in thy ship, and take thou a share in our ship. A bargain!

Join thy ship with ours and clothe thee in black as we [do], so that, if thou holdest thy lantern on high, thou mayst find something, that the fish may not see thy glory and thy ship may take in fish. If thou dost give ear (to us), thou shalt catch fish, throw them into thy ship and do business. If thou givest no ear to our discourse, thou shalt eat salt; but if thou doest our works, thou shalt eat oil and honey. Thou stirrest a broth, thou fillest a bowl and sharest it with all of the fishers. We appoint thee as head over all of us. The fishers gather together beside thee, the first follow behind thee; they will be thy slaves, and thou takest three shares of what falls to our share. Our father shall be thy servant and we will call ourselves thy bondsmen. Our mother shall sit on thy couch (?)

She shall space out the floats of cedar and put the lead-sinkers into the meshes,&#8212;meshes, meshes which are then more heavy than all of the world. She shall divide the water by means of the yarns, and when the fish run into them they shall be stopped. Then they know not the way that they seek, and have no wit to turn back to their way. Like walls that collapse, they (the nets) come and fall on the good. They do not let the fish rise, nor turn their face to the boulders.<A NAME="page_77_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_77_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> They make them sink deep under the mud and shut them into ... ... ... ... .

Woe to the fish who fall into them."<A NAME="page_77_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_77_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Fisher heard this, he stamped on the bows of the ship. The Fisher stamped on the ships of the fishers; the fishers lie in the shallows close crowded together, tied up together like bundles of wheat, and cannot rise up. The reeds swish ...,<A NAME="page_77_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_77_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> and the fish of the sea lie over the fishers. They snarl in the marsh and the water rings them round in its circle (?).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shrilling he spake with his voice. He discoursed with his voice sublime and spake to the catchers of fish: "Off from me,

<P ALIGN="center">THE FINAL SUBMISSION OF THE EVIL FISHERS (&sect; 39).</P>

<P ALIGN="center">In the Name of Great Life may hallowed Light be glorified.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'TIS the voice of the Pure Fisher who calls and instructs the fish of the sea in the shallows. He speaks to them: "Raise your ... up, on the surface of the water stand upright; then will your force be double as great. Guard yourselves from the fishers who catch the fish and beat on the Jordan.<A NAME="page_79_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_79_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> Shilmai and Nidbai<A NAME="page_79_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_79_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> curse them, and they depart and settle themselves down behind me a mile off. The fish curse their casting-net in their place."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Fisher thus spake, warning all [of the fish, when] the fishers his voice heard, they came up and gathered around him. They put themselves forward to ask of him questions, and knew not whence he came. "Where wast thou, Fisher," they ask him, "that we heard not thy voice in the marsh? Thy ship is not like our ship, and thy ... is not * * * * * *. Thy ship is not tarred over with pitch, and thou art not like the fishers of this world."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fishers thus spake, the Fisher made answer unto them: "Have done, ye fishers and fishers' sons; off, get you gone from me! Off, go up to your village, the Ruins, Jerusalem. Ask about me of your father, who knows me, ask of your mother, who is my maid-servant.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they heard this from the Fisher who has come hither, and understood, they spake to him: "Have compassion, forbearance and mercy on us and forgive us our sins and transgressions. We are thy slaves, show thyself indulgent towards us. We will look after thy fish that none of them fails. We will be the servants of thy disciples, who name thy Name in Truth.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A SHEPHERD am I who loves his sheep; sheep and lambs I watch over. Round my neck [I carry] the sheep; and the sheep from the hamlet stray not.

From the mouth of Euphrates, from the mouth of Euphrates the Radiant,<A NAME="page_81_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_81_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> things of marvellous goodness I brought them. I brought them myrtle, white sesame brought them and brought them bright standards.<A NAME="page_81_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_81_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> I cleansed them and washed them and made them to smell the sweet odour of Life.

A thief breaks not into their fold; and of a knife<A NAME="page_81_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_81_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A> they need not be anxious. When my sheep were quietly laid down and my head lay there on the threshold, a rift was rent in the height and thunder did thunder behind me. The clouds seized hold one of another,

and unchained were the raging tempests. Rain poured down in sheets and hail that smites elephants low, hail that shatters the mountains. And the tempests unchain themselves in an hour.<A NAME="page_82_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_82_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> Seas burst forth; they flooded the whole of the world.

To them I pipe on my pipe, and beat on my tabour (?), [leading them] to the water.<A NAME="page_82_fr_5"></A><A HREF="#page_82_note_5"><SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP></A> I call to them: "My little sheep, little sheep, come! Rise up at my call! Come, rise at my call; then will you 'scape the cloud-dragons. Come, come unto me! I am a shepherd whose boat is soon coming. My boat of glory is coming; and I come with it, and bring my sheep and lambs in aboard it. Every one who gives ear to my call and heed gives unto my voice, and who turns his gaze unto me, of him take I hold with my hands and bring him unto me inboard my boat." But every lamb, male and female, that suffered himself to be caught, the water-whirl carried away, the greedy water did swallow. Whoever gave no ear to my call, sank under. To the highest part of the vessel I went. The bows stand up with the bow-post.<A NAME="page_82_fr_6"></A><A HREF="#page_82_note_6"><SUP><SMALL>6</SMALL></SUP></A> I say: How woeful am I for my sheep who

because of the mud have sunk under. The water-whirl sank them away from my reach, the swirling whirl of the water. How grieved am I for the rams whose fleece on their sides has dragged them down into the deep. How grieved am I for the lambkins whose bellies have not [yet] been filled full of milk. Of a thousand, one I recovered; of a whole generation I found again two. Happy is he who [stood up?] in the water, and in whose ears no water has entered. Happy the great rams who have stamped with their feet. Happy is he who has escaped from the Seven and Twelve, the sheep-stealers. Happy is he who has not couched down, has not lain down, has not loved to sleep deeply. Happy is he who in this defective age of Bishlom<A NAME="page_83_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_83_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> has stayed whole. Happy are they who free themselves from the snares of R&#363;h&#257; (the Mother World-Spirit), from the filth and the shame and the bondage that have no end. My chosen! whoever shall live at the end of this age of Nirig (Mars), for him let his own conscience be a support. He will come and mount up to the Radiant Dwelling, to the region whose sun never sets, and whose light-lamps<A NAME="page_83_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_83_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> never darken.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next piece I have selected, treats of the source of all glory and enlightenment, called the Treasury of Life, that in which all spiritual powers and blessings are stored. The origin of the motive is without doubt the Iranian concept of the <I>&#7717;vareno</I>, the divine and kingly glory. In the Mand&aelig;an tradition it has become highly developed and is frequently personified as a female greatness. Thus in the Oxford MS. F. it is spoken of as "the Mother of all the Kings [of the Light], from whom all worlds have come forth, who separated herself from the fervency of the Hidden Mysteries." Many <I>r&ocirc;les</I> are assigned to this Light of Life in the complexities of the celestial and cosmic dramas; and in the human stage it shines forth as the glory with which the perfected are vestured and

<!------------------------page 86------------------------>

<A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A>

crowned. I have chosen the simplest of the narratives or discourses on the topic. In the still more complex system of the phase of development represented by the <I>Pistis Sophia</I> collection there is no mention of the Treasury of Life, but the Treasury of Light is one of its most important conceptions. The Mand&aelig;an tradition conserves the echoes of an earlier phase, for it is indubitably less over-worked.</P>

<P ALIGN="center">In the Name of Great Life may hallowed Light be glorified.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE Treasury am I, Life's Treasury (S&#299;math-Haiy&#275;); the Treasury am I, the Mighty One's Treasury; the Treasury am I, Life's Treasury. A crown was I for the Mighty from everlasting. The Treasury am I, Life's Treasury. Ever did I give light to the treasures and to the shek&#299;nahs, and was for adornment to Jordan. For adornment became I to Jordan, who was from everlasting, through whom the treasures give light. Great [Life] made me limpid and lucent and made me into a vesture. He made me into his vesture, which day in and day out sings measureless praise of the &AElig;ther.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Treasury am I, Life's Treasury. To the King of the Splendour became I a crown. The treasures shine through my glory and praise my form beyond measure.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Treasury am I, Life's Treasury&#8212;I who as adornment settled down on the King of the Splendour, so that he shone in his mind, that he became bright and shining, and his form glittered more than the [light-] worlds. As I (lit. it) gave light and enlightenment unto the treasures and to the shek&#299;nahs [e'en] in the &AElig;ther, the King laid me as vesture round N<SUP>e</SUP>&#7779;ab the Radiant.<A NAME="page_86_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_86_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> N<SUP>e</SUP>&#7779;ab the Radiant then took me, brought me and laid me as vesture o'er Jordan. As vesture o'er Jordan he laid me, through whom the treasures shine beyond measure.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Treasury am I, Life's Treasury. The wicked are blind

I cry unto them; yet the wicked hear not and sink into the great Sea of the Ending. Therefore was Jordan made a bridge for the treasures; a bridge for the treasures became he, while he cut off the wicked and hurled them into the great Sea of the Ending.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Treasury am I, Life's Treasury. A crown I became for Life's Gnosis. He bestowed on me the rulership over the treasures and the shek&#299;nahs which are there [yonder].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Treasury am I, Life's Treasury. Of the light-worlds was I the enlightener. Day in and day out they sing praise to Great [Life], and through me they mount upward and behold the Light's region.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Treasury am I, Life's Treasury. A vesture for the light-worlds became I.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The Treasury] am I, Life's Treasury. A King for the Naz&#333;r&aelig;ans became I. I became a King for the Naz&#333;r&aelig;ans, who through my Name find praise and assurance. Praise and assurance they find through my Name, and on my Name they mount up and behold the Light's region. For the Men of purity put to the test&#8212;[for them] their eye became full of Light. Full of Light was their eye, and in their heart Life's Gnosis took seat. Whoever of me, Life's Treasury, makes his investment, loves not gold and silver, loves not gold and possessions, [loves not] food of the body, and envy with him has no place. Envy found with him no place, and he did not forget his night-prayer. He forgot not the discourses and writings, and he forsook not his Lord's word. He forsook not the prayer of his Father, Life's Gnosis; wherefor into the great End-Sea he falls not. He forgot not Sunday, nor did he neglect the Day's evening. He forgot not the way of Great [Life, the way] of wages and alms. He will be rapt away in the night-prayer, he will be rapt away in shining vestures which have come from Great [Life]. Treasures for him fill up what falls short, and what is empty they load for him full. If he bears a pure load, he is counted with the Men of piety put to the test who separate themselves [from the world] in the Name of Yawar.<A NAME="page_87_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_87_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> Life's

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have called with clear voice and directed hereto the disciples: "The vine who bears fruit, doth ascend; who bears none will here be cut off.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Mand&aelig;an religion preserves echoes of a wealth of ancient mythical elements found in Iranian, Babylonian and Semitic traditions is evident on all hands. A process of syncretism had presumably gone on for generations before an impulse from within caused the blending to assume a distinctively Mand&aelig;an form; and when this emerged, the preservation of the memory of the process had no interest for the faith and fell back into the depths of the subconscious. At any-rate the writers or recorders of the tractates throughout seem honestly persuaded of the complete independence of their tradition from every other form of religion. They are for ever proclaiming the blessings of loyalty to what they claim to be the original, the one and only, revelation of Truth vouchsafed to the world throughout the ages, and declaring that continued spiritual contact with instructors from on high who mediated this divine wisdom, was still possible. They certainly do not give one the idea of being intellectualists consciously at work on a syncretic synthesis of prior material; on the contrary they seem to live and move in a milieu of prophetical outpourings and to have been extremely sensitive to psychical impressions. Inspirational discourses and intuitive interpretations of prophetical

utterances seem to have been their delight. The following piece may enable the reader to sense somewhat of the peculiar atmosphere of mystical expectancy in which they sought instruction. The topic is one of the chief points of their questioning&#8212;the conflict that arose between the Light and the Darkness in the beginnings and how victory is to be achieved. They were not of course absolute Dualists, for always and everywhere victory lies with Life Everlasting, who transcends not only the Darkness but also the Light.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To you I say and declare, ye chosen and perfect, ye who dwell in the world: Become not of the Darkness a portion, but lift up your eyes to Light's region. From the Evil unto the Good separate yourselves out; from the sinful evil of the region of Darkness separate yourselves out. Love and instruct one another, that your sin and [your] guilt be forgiven you. See and hear and get you instructed, that ye may ascend to Light's region victorious.</P>

Who will come, who will tell me whether there was <I>one</I> King or <I>two</I> [in the beginning]?" The good speak and let themselves be instructed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<I>Two</I> Kings were there, <I>two</I> natures were fashioned&#8212;a King of this world and a King from outside of the worlds. The King of this age girt on a sword and [put on] a crown of Darkness. A crown of Darkness he put on his head, and took a sword in his right hand. A sword he took in his right hand; he stands there and slaughters his sons, and his sons slaughter each other. The King from outside of the worlds set a crown of Light on his head. A crown of Light he set on his head, and took Truth in his right hand. Truth in his right hand he took, and stands there and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor one, from anguish and fear be thou free!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say not: I stand here alone.<BR>
For thy sake, O Poor,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this firmament was outspread,<BR>
Was this firmament spread out,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stars were pictured upon it.<BR>
For thy sake, O Poor,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this firm land came into existence,<BR>

<BR>
Came into existence this firm land,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the condensing took form, fell into the water.<BR>
For thy sake came the sun,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for thy sake the moon was reveal&egrave;d.<BR>
For thy sake, O Poor, came the Seven,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Twelve are hither discended.<BR>
Thou Poor one! On thy right rests glory,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on thy left rest [light-] lamps.<BR>
Hold steadfast in thy security,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until thy measure has been completed.<BR>
When thy measure has been completed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will myself come to thee.<BR>
I will bring thee vestures of glory,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that the worlds will long for them, desireful.<BR>
I will bring the a pure, excellent head-dress,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abundant in infinite light.<BR>
I will set thee free from the wicked,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the sinners will I deliver thee.<BR>
I will make thee dwell in thy shek&#299;nah<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free thee into the region unsullied."<BR>
I hear the voice of the Seven,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who whisper in secret and speak:<BR>
"Blessed is he who is to the Poor one a father,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who is unto the Fruit a tender.<BR>
Hail to him whom Great Life knows,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;woe to him whom Great Life knows not."<BR>
Hail to him whom Great Life knew,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who has kept himself stranger to this world,<BR>
The world of the defect,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in which the Planets are seated.<BR>
They sit on thrones of rebellion<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and drill their works with the scourge.<BR>
For gold and for silver are they disquiet,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and strife they cast into the world.<BR>
Disquiet are they and therein cast strife;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore will they go hence and seethe in the fire.<BR>
The wicked shall seethe, and their pomp<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall vanish and come to an end.<BR>
But I with my offspring and kindred<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall ascend and see the Light's region,<BR>

<BR>
The region whose sun never sets,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whose light-lamps never darken&#8212;<BR>
That region, the state [of the Blessed],<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whereto your souls are called and invited.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
And so are our good brothers' souls,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the souls of our faithful sisters.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Life is exalted and is victorious, and victorious is the Man who has come hither.<BR>

<P><A NAME="page_71_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_71_fr_1">1</A> This section is the most difficult of all to translate owing to the abundance of technical fishing terms. In spite of marvellous philological industry and wide-flung enquiries L. has been unable to identify a number of words.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_72_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_72_fr_2">2</A> Lit. 'on the high seas' L. glosses this as meaning that they are not river fish; but this seems to me unnecessary, as my rendering suggests.</P>

</P>

<P><A NAME="page_74_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_74_fr_1">1</A> K. is the infernal river which the souls have to cross after death; its waters are figured as dragons and its waves as scorpions (&sect; 51). Ulai is also a river. If it is in any way connected with the Eul&aelig;us from which the Kings of Persia are fabled to have drunk, the sense is hard to find. It is more probably an infernal stream, at any rate one from which the evil fishers drank.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_77_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_77_fr_2">2</A> The numerous gaps which have to be left owing to uncertainty of translation make a number of the above sentences unintelligible. The concluding paragraphs are presumably an allegory of the attractions of false religions, and can hardly be thought to be part of the speech of the fishers.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_77_note_3"></A><A HREF="#page_77_fr_3">3</A> Presumably as the waves made by the foundering ships reach the shore.</P>

</P>

<P><A NAME="page_82_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_82_fr_1">1</A> This may mean at a certain period or appointed time.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_82_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_82_fr_2">2</A> The faithful are figured as birds as well as sheep.</P>

<!------------------------footnotes page 83------------------------>

<A NAME="footnotes_page_83"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 83</FONT></A>

</P>

<P><A NAME="page_83_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_83_fr_1">1</A> Lidzbarski (p. 465) thinks this refers to the Moslim period. Elsewhere we find the parallel phrase 'age of Bizbat,' which L. also refers to Muhammad. But Bizbat is clearly a corrupt form of Baal-Zebul, and therefore the reference should be more general.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_83_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_83_fr_2">2</A> Presumably stars.</P>

<P>

<!------------------------footnotes page 84------------------------>

<!------------------------footnotes page 85------------------------>

<A NAME="footnotes_page_85"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A>

</P>

<P><A NAME="page_85_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_85_fr_1">1</A> A still more degraded form of cult is mentioned, but the meaning baffles the translator; it is referred to those who bow down before R&#363;h&#257;, here in mockery called 'Holy' Spirit.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_85_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_85_fr_2">2</A> The above is obscure, especially the 'pen-demon' reference. The general sense. however, seems to be that those who fall away from the Mand&aelig;an faith are not to be restrained by force, but let go their way.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_85_note_3"></A><A HREF="#page_85_fr_3">3</A> <I>Sc</I>. Life. The concluding paragraph runs on without break in the German, being assigned to the same speaker; but the subject is clearly changed and the whole spirit is different. The Good Shepherd now seeks for the lost sheep and does not leave it to perish.</P>

<P>

<!------------------------footnotes page 86------------------------>

<A NAME="footnotes_page_86"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A>

</P>

<P><A NAME="page_86_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_86_fr_1">1</A> In &sect; 9 (<A HREF="gjb-2-1.htm#page_39">p. 39</A>) N. is called the Watcher who has his station in every region, <I>i.e.</I> the Great Watcher.</P>

<!------------------------footnotes page 90------------------------>

<A NAME="footnotes_page_90"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 90</FONT></A>

</P>

<P><A NAME="page_90_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_90_fr_1">1</A> <I>Kann&#257;</I>. L. leaves this technical term untranslated; but in note 4 to p. 4 he shows that it frequently means a wine-cup or wine-bowl. I would therefore venture to connect it with the widespread notion of the <I>krat&#275;r</I> or mixing-bowl of souls as handed on, for instance, by Plato in the Tim&aelig;us, presumably from Hither Asian sources. One of the treatises of the <I>Corpus Hermeticum</I> is called 'The Cup' or 'The Bowl,' or alternatively 'The Monad.' It was not only the source of souls, but also the Mind into which they had to be dowsed for spiritual baptism or regeneration.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_90_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_90_fr_2">2</A> Presumably the rays of glory, signifying a state of contemplation.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_90_note_3"></A><A HREF="#page_90_fr_3">3</A> The supernal powers.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_90_note_4"></A><A HREF="#page_90_fr_4">4</A> I can find no explanation of this occasionally recurring figure; it indubitably goes back to some ancient myth.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_91_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_91_fr_2">2</A> <I>Sc</I>. the heavenly powers.</P>
