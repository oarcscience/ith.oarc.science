<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A CHILD was planted out of the height, a mystery revealed in Jerusalem.<A NAME="page_35_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_35_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> The priests saw dreams; chill seized on their children, chill seized on Jerusalem.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in the morning he<A NAME="page_35_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_35_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> went to the temple. He opened his mouth in blasphemy and his lips of lying. He opened his mouth in blasphemy and spake to all of the priests:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my vision of the night I beheld, [I beheld] in my vision. When I lay there, I slept not and rested not, and sleep came not to me by night.

sun sank and the lights rose. Fire lit up the house of the people (synagogue), smoke rose over the temple. A quaking quaked in the Throne-chariot,<A NAME="page_36_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_36_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> so that Earth removed from her seat. A star flew down into Jud&aelig;a, a star flew down into Jerusalem. The sun appeared by night, and the moon rose by day."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the priests heard this, they cast dust on their head.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth groans out of season and is sent a-whirl through the heaven-spheres. Earth<A NAME="page_37_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_37_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> opens her mouth and speaks to Elizar: "Go to Lilyukh,<A NAME="page_37_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_37_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> that he may interpret the dreams you have seen," Thereon Elizar opened his mouth and spake unto all of the priests: "Who goes to Lilyukh, that he may interpret the dreams you have seen?" Then wrote they a letter and put it in the hand of &#7788;&#257;b-Y&#333;m&#299;n. &#7788;&#257;b-Y&#333;m&#299;n took the letter and betook himself to Lilyukh, Lilyukh lay on his bed; sleep had not yet flown from him. A quaking came into his heart, shivered his heart and brought it down from its stay, &#7788;&#257;b-Y&#333;m&#299;n drew near to Lilyukh, &#7788;&#257;b-Y&#333;m&#299;n stepped up to Lilyukh, shook him out of his sleep and spake to him: "The priests saw dreams, . . . [the above paragraph is repeated verbally down to] . . . and the moon rose by day."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lilyukh heard this, he cast dust on his head. Naked, Lilyukh rose from his bed and fetched the dream-book. He opens it and reads in it and looks for what stands there written. He opens it and reads therein and interprets the dreams in silence without reading aloud. He writes them in a letter and expounds them on a leaf. In it he says to them: "Woe unto you, all of you priests, for Enishbai shall bear a child. Woe unto you, ye rabbis, for a child shall be born in Jerusalem. Woe unto you, ye teachers and pupils, for Enishbai shall bear a child, woe unto you, Mistress Torah (the Law), for Y&#333;h&#257;n&#257; shall be born in Jerusalem."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilyukh writes unto them in the letter and says to them: "The star, that came and stood over Enishbai: A child will be planted out of the height from above; he comes and will be given unto Enishbai. The fire, that burned in Old Father Zakhri&#257;: Y&#333;h&#257;n&#257; will be born in Jerusalem."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#7788;&#257;b-Y&#333;m&#299;n took the letter and in haste made off to Jerusalem.

He came and found all the priests sitting in sorrow. He took the letter and laid it in the hand of Elizar. He (E.) opens it and reads it and finds in it wondrous discourses. He opens it and reads it and sees what stands therein written. He reads it in silence and gives them no decision about it. Elizar then took it and laid it in the hand of Old Father Zakhri&#257;. He (Z.) opens it and reads it and sees what stands therein written. He reads it in silence and gives no decision about it. Elizar now opened his mouth and spake to Old Father Zakhri&#257;: "Old Father, get thee gone from Jud&aelig;a, lest thou stir up strife in Jerusalem." Old Father then raised his right hand and smote on the head Elizar: "Elizar, thou great house, thou head of all the priests! If thou in thy inner [part] knewest thy mother, thou wouldst not dare come into our synagogue. If thou in thy inner [part] knewest, thou wouldst not dare read the Torah. For thy mother was a wanton.<A NAME="page_38_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_38_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> A wanton was she, who did not match with the house of her husband's father. As thy father had not the hundred gold staters for writing her the bill of divorcement, he abandoned her straightway and enquired not for her. Is there a day when I come and look forth,<A NAME="page_38_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_38_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> and see not M&#299;sh&#257; bar Amr&#257;?<A NAME="page_38_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_38_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> Yea, is there a day when I come without praying in your synagogue, that you (pl.) should be false and dishonest and say a word which you have ne'er heard about me? Where is there a dead man who becomes living again, that Enishbai should bear a child? Where is there a blind man who becomes seeing, where is there a lame man for whom his feet [walk again], and where is there a mute who learns [to read in] a book, that Enishbai should bear a child? It is two and twenty years<A NAME="page_38_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_38_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A> to-day that I have seen no wife. Nay, neither through me nor through you will Enishbai bear a child."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all of the priests arose and said to Old Father Zakhri&#257;, [they said] in reproach: "Be at rest and keep thy seat, Old Father, and let the calm of the Good (pl.) rest upon thee. Old

Father, if there were no dreams in Jud&aelig;a, then would all that M&#299;sh&#257; has said, be lying. Rather shall thy word and our word be made good, and the dreams we have seen. Y&#333;h&#257;n&#257; will receive Jordan and be called prophet in Jerusalem."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereon Old Father removed himself from their midst, and Elizar followed him. Then were seen three lights (lit. lamps) which companied with him (Z.). They (the priests) ran up, caught Old Father by the hem of his robe and said to him: "Old Father, what is 't that goes before thee, and what is 't that follows thee?" Then answered he them: "O Elizar, thou great house, thou head of all of the priests, I know not whom the lights guard which go before me. I know not with whom the fire goes which follows me. [But] neither through me nor through you will Enishbai bear a child."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all the priests rose and said to Old Father Zakhri&#257;, [they said] in reproach: "Old Father Zakhri&#257;, be at peace, firm and decided, for the child will be planted from out of the most high height and be given to thee in thy old age. Y&#333;h&#257;n&#257; will be born, Y&#333;h&#257;n&#257; will receive Jordan and be called prophet in Jerusalem. We will be baptized with his baptizing and with his pure sign [will we] be signed. We will take his bread and drink his drink and with him ascend to Light's region."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the priests arose and said to Old Father Zakhri&#257;, [they said] in reproach: "Old Father! We will enlighten thee as to thy race<A NAME="page_39_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_39_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> and thy fathers, from whom thou hast come forth. . . . [there follows a list of prophets and sages, beginning with Moses, which I omit, as it requires a lengthy commentary for which space here does not serve,&#8212;ending with]. . . &#7788;&#257;b-Y&#333;m&#299;n and the school-teachers have come forth from thy race. The blessed princes, who are thy forbears, Old Father, all of them have taken no wife and begotten no sons.<A NAME="page_39_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_39_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> Yet in their old age<A NAME="page_39_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_39_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> each of them

had a son.<A NAME="page_40_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_40_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> They had sons, and they were prophets in Jerusalem. If now out of thee as well a prophet comes forth, thou dost then revive this race again. Yea, Y&#333;h&#257;n&#257; will be born and will be called prophet in Jerusalem."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Elizar opened his mouth and said to Old Father: "Old Father! If Y&#333;h&#257;n&#257; receives Jordan, then will I be his servant, be baptized with his baptizing and signed with his pure sign. We will take his bread and drink his drink and with him ascend to Light's region." Then Old Father opened his mouth and said unto all of the priests: "If the child comes out of the most high height, what then will you do in Jerusalem?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They<A NAME="page_40_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_40_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> have taken the child out of the basin of Jordan and laid him in the womb of Enishbai.</P>

whose praise dost thou make proclamation?" Thereon I gave to them answer: "I stand in the strength of my Father and with the praise of the Man, my creator. I have built no house in Jud&aelig;a, have set up no throne in Jerusalem. I have not loved the wreath of the roses, not commerce with lovely women. I have not loved the defective,<A NAME="page_41_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_41_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> not loved the cup of the drunkards.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Yahy&#257; said this, Life rejoiced over him greatly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YAHY&#256; proclaims in the nights and speaks: "Stand not I here alone? I go to and fro. Where is a prophet equal to me? Who makes proclamation equal to my proclamations, and who doth discourse with my wondrous voice?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YAHY&#256; proclaims in the nights.&#8212;Glory rises over the worlds.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who told Yeshu (Eshu)? Who told Yeshu Messiah, son of Miryam, who told Yeshu, so that he went to the shore of the Jordan and said [unto Yahy&#257;]: "Yahy&#257;, baptize me with thy baptizing and utter o'er me also the Name thy wont is to utter. If I show myself as thy pupil, I will remember thee then in my writing;

<!------------------------page 49------------------------>

<A NAME="page_49"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 49</FONT></A>

I attest not myself as thy pupil, then wipe out my name from thy page,"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereon Yahy&#257; answered Yeshu Messiah in Jerusalem: "Thou hast lied to the Jews and deceived the priests. Thou hast cut off their seed from the men and from the women bearing and being pregnant. The sabbath, which Moses made binding, hast thou relaxed<A NAME="page_49_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_49_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> in Jerusalem. Thou hast lied unto them with horns<A NAME="page_49_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_49_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> and spread abroad disgrace with the shofar."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereon Yeshu Messiah answered Yahy&#257; in Jerusalem: "If I have lied to the Jews, may the blazing fire consume me. If I have deceived the priests, a double death will I die. If I have cut off their seed from the men, may I not cross o'er the End-Sea. If I have cut off from the women birth and being pregnant, then is in sooth a judge raised up before me. If I have relaxed the sabbath, may the blazing fire consume me. If I have lied to the Jews, I will tread on thorns and thistles. If I have spread disgrace abroad with horn-blowing, may my eyes then not light on Abathur.<A NAME="page_49_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_49_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> So baptize me then with thy baptizing, and utter o'er me the Name thy wont is to utter. If I show myself as thy pupil, I will remember thee then in my writing; if I attest not myself as thy pupil, then wipe out my name from thy page."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spake Yahy&#257; to Yeshu Messiah in Jerusalem: "A stammerer becomes not a scholar, a blind man writes no letter. A desolate house<A NAME="page_49_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_49_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A> mounts not to the height, and a widow becomes not a virgin. Foul water becomes not tasty, and a stone does not with oil soften."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereon Yeshu Messiah made answer to Yahy&#257; in Jerusalem: "A stammerer a scholar becomes, a blind man writes a letter. A desolate house mounts unto the height, and a widow becomes a virgin. Foul water becomes tasty, and a stone with oil softens."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereon spake Yahy&#257; unto Yeshu Messiah in Jerusalem: "If

<!------------------------page 50------------------------>

<A NAME="page_50"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 50</FONT></A>

thou givest me illustration for this, thou art [really] a wise Messiah."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereon Yeshu Messiah made answer to Yahy&#257; in Jerusaem: "A stammerer a scholar becomes: a child who comes from the bearer, blooms and grows big. Through wages and alms he comes on high; he comes on high through wages and alms, and ascends and beholds the Light's region.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A blind man who writes a letter: a villain who has become virtuous. He abandoned wantonness and abandoned theft and reached unto faith in almighty Life.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A desolate house who ascends again to the height: one of position who has become humble. He quitted his palaces and quitted his pride and built a house on the sea [-shore]. A house he built on the sea [-shore], and into it opened two doors, so that he might bring in unto him whoever lay down there in misery,&#8212;to him he opened the door and took him within to himself. If he would eat, he laid for him a table with Truth, If he would drink, he mixed for him [wine-] cups [with Truth], If he would lie down, he spread a bed for him in Truth. If he would depart, he led him forth on the way of Truth. He led him forth on the way of Truth and of faith, and then he ascends and beholds the Light's region.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A widow who a virgin becomes: a woman who already in youth has been widowed. She kept her shame closed, and sat there till her children were grown.<A NAME="page_50_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_50_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> If she passes over, her face does not pale in her husband's<A NAME="page_50_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_50_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> presence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Foul water that is made tasty: a girl wanton who has got back her honour: she went up a hamlet and she went down a hamlet without taking her veil from her face.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A stone with oil softens: a heretic who has come down from the mountain.<A NAME="page_50_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_50_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> He abandoned magic and sorcery and made

<A NAME="page_51"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 51</FONT></A>

confession to almighty Life. He found a fatherless and filled him full and filled full the widow's pockets.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefor baptize me, O Yahy&#257;, with thy baptizing and utter o'er me the Name thy wont is to utter. If I show myself as thy pupil, I will remember thee in my writing; if I attest not myself as thy pupil, then wipe out my name from thy page. Thou wilt for thy sins be haled to account, and I for my sins will be haled to account."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Yeshu Messiah said this, there came a Letter out of the House of Abathur: "Yahy&#257;, baptize the deceiver in Jordan. Lead him down into the Jordan and baptize him, and lead him up again to the shore, find there set him."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then R&#363;h&#257;<A NAME="page_51_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_51_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> made herself like to a dove and threw a cross<A NAME="page_51_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_51_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> over the Jordan.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He<A NAME="page_52_fr_5"></A><A HREF="#page_52_note_5"><SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP></A> says: "Yahy&#257;, thou art like to a scorched mountain, which brings forth no grapes in this world.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Yahy&#257; heard this, a tear gathered in his eye; a tear in his eye gathered, and he spake: "It would be pleasant to take a wife, and delightul for me to have children. But only if I take no woman,&#8212;and then comes sleep, desire for her seizes me and I neglect my night-prayer. If only desire does not wake in me, and I forget my Lord out of my mind. If only desire does not wake in me, and I neglect my prayer every time."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Yahy&#257; said this, there came a Letter from the House of Abathur: "Yahy&#257;, take a wife and found a family, and see that thou dost not let this world come to an end.

"Instruct thy daughter, that she may not perish; and I will enlighten my sons and teach [them], that they may not be hindered." Thereon Anhar opened her mouth and spoke to Yahy&#257; in Jerusalem. "I have borne sons in this world," said she to him, "yet have I not given birth to [their] heart<A NAME="page_54_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_54_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> in the world.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then answered she him: "My lord, how shall it be that a woman in labour . . . "[and so on, repeating the above].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If thou knowest," he makes answer unto her, "that this does never happen, why dost thou press me with asking: When dost thou return? I go hence and return not.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereon Anhar opened her mouth and spake to Yahy&#257; in Jerusalem: "I will buy thee for dear gold a brick grave<A NAME="page_55_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_55_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> and have a boxing of wood<A NAME="page_55_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_55_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A> joinered together for thee in the graveyard."

They clothed me with vestures of glory and veiled me with cloud-veils.<A NAME="page_58_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_58_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> They wound round me a girdle,<A NAME="page_58_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_58_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> of [living] water a girdle, which shone beyond measure and glistened. They set me within a cloud, a cloud of splendour, and in the seventh hour of a Sunday they brought me to the Jerusalem region. Then cried a voice in Jud&aelig;a, a crying proclaimed in Jerusalem. They call out: "What woman had a son, who then was stolen? What woman has made for him a vow<A NAME="page_58_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_58_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> and been heedless about it? What woman had a son, who was stolen? Let her come and see after her son."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who told Battai, who instructed Battai, who told Battai to go and say to Enishbai: "A youth has come to Jud&aelig;a, a prophet come to Jerusalem. A youth has come to Jud&aelig;a; his guardian angel stands by him. His mouth is like thee and his lips [like] his father, Old Father Zakhri&#257;. His eyes are like thee and his brows [like] his father, Old Father Zakhri&#257;. His nose is like thee and his hands [like] his father, Old Father Zakhri&#257;."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Enishbai heard this, she hurried out veil-less. When Old Father Zakhri&#257; saw her thus, he wrote her a bill of divorcement. The Sun down-murmured from heaven and the Moon from its place mid the stars. The Sun opened his mouth and spoke to Old Father Zakhri&#257; in Jerusalem: "Old Father Zakhri&#257;, thou great dotard (?), who has grown old and lost his wits, like an Arab whom his <I>kismet</I> has forsaken.<A NAME="page_58_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_58_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A> A youth has come to Jud&aelig;a, a prophet come to Jerusalem. A youth has come to Jud&aelig;a; why dost thou send Enishbai away?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the youth saw her alone, he set himself free and fell down from the cloud. He set himself free and fell down from the cloud and kissed the mouth of Enishbai. When An&#333;sh, the treasure, saw him [do this], he spake unto Yahy&#257; in Jerusalem: "Stands it for thee written in thy book, is it declared unto thee

on thy page, to kiss her alone, on the mouth?"&#8212;Thereon answered Yahy&#257; and spake unto An&#333;sh, the treasure, in Jerusalem: "Nine months I abode in her womb,<A NAME="page_59_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_59_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> so long as all other children abide there, without any reluctance on her part; therefore is it no charge against me now to kiss her alone, on the mouth. Nay, hail and again hail to the man who repays father and mother in full. A man who recompenses father and mother, has not his like in the world."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Yahy&#257; said this, An&#333;sh, the treasure, knew that Yahy&#257; is wise. Thereon An&#333;sh, the treasure, spake to the Sun in Jerusalem: "Take for me care of the youth, the Man, who is sent by the King. Take for me care of the youth, until we ask for him." Then An&#333;sh, the treasure, spake to the Moon in Jerusalem: "Take for me care of the youth, the Man, who is sent by the King. Take for me care of the youth, until we ask for him."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messiah opened his mouth and spake to Yahy&#257; in Jerusalem:

<!------------------------page 60------------------------>

<A NAME="page_60"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 60</FONT></A>

"I asked thee, Yahy&#257;, by Great Life and by Sunday, whose name is dear. I asked thee Yahy&#257;, by the Way, whereby the Men of piety put to the test go without hindrance. Tell me: To what is the shape of &#7778;auri&#275;l's<A NAME="page_60_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_60_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> knife like? Tell me: If the soul leaves the body, with what is it clothed, and to what is it like in the vain body? Surely the soul is not possibly like the blood, that it should become heated in the body and come to a stop in it? Surely the soul is not possibly like the wind, that it should fare to the mountains, be lost there and come to a stop? Surely the soul is not possibly like the dew, that it should fall on the fruit and be lost?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Messiah said this, Yahy&#257; cries aloud; tears come to him without ceasing, and he speaks: "[God] forbid that the high King of Light should look for lot in deceivers. The soul is not like the blood, that it should become heated in the body and come to a stop, The soul is not like the dew, that it should fall on the fruit and be lost. The soul is not like the wind, that it should fare to the mountains and come to a stop. Firmly developed has the soul been brought into the vain body. If the soul has kept herself perfect, she ascends in a garment of glory.</P>

One he lets loose against her in the evening, the other at cock-crow; the third lets he loose 'gainst her at the coming-forth of the rays. If the fire begins to be fierce, the soul slips out of the feet and the knees. Out of the feet and the knees slips she, and draws nigh to the hips. Thereon leaves she the hips, reaches the heart, and seeks to keep there her ground. Then falls she into the breast, and it squeezes ... ... The eyes, the face and the lips of the man twitch, and the tongue twists hither and thither.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_35_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_35_fr_1">1</A> Because Y&#333;h&#257;n&#257; is mentioned only once in the <I>Genz&#257;</I>, Brandt supposes that the John-Book pieces must be later in date. But surely this is not a scientific conjecture. It is rather to be supposed that the John-pieces were naturally gathered together from the general mass of material when the collection-process began. Though Yahy&#257; is the Arabic form of the name, Y&#333;h&#257;n&#257; alternates with it; this shows a later redaction in the Mohammedan period, when the people vulgarly spoke Arabic, but says nothing as to the date of earlier writings from which the pieces were copied out.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_35_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_35_fr_2">2</A> <I>Ur-ashlam</I>, a mock-name or derisive caricature-permutation = 'Ur perfected' it. Ur is originally the Chald&aelig;an Deus Lunus; he is the eldest son of R&#363;h&#257;, the World-Mother, and corresponds in some respects with the Yaldaba&#333;th of 'Ophite' gnosticism.</P>

The name may be some mystical echo of Elisheba, the wife of Aaron, the first priest, just as the Miriam of the Jesus birth-story reminds us of Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Moses, the first prophet. If the pre-Christian Palestinian Dorsh&#275; Reshum&#333;th may be thought incapable of going so far, the Alexandrian Jewish allegorists, to whose school Philo belonged, would, and did, sublimate the sister or wife of a sage into a figure of his spiritual virtue or power. This will become clearer later on.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_36_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_36_fr_2">2</A> The narrative is largely in the familiar style of Danielic and Talm&#363;dic chronological camouflage; the Daniel Book (<I>c</I>. 164 B.C.) throws back the religio-political conflict of the Jews with the kingdorn and Hellenistic religion of Antiochus Epiphanes to the days of Nebuchhadnezzar (<I>c</I>. 600 B.C.), and the Talm&#363;d Jesus stories, for instance, throw back the setting to some 100 years B.C. or advance it to some 100 years A.D. See my <I>Did Jesus Live 100 B.C.?&#8212;An Enquiry into the Talm&#363;d-Jesus Stories, the Toldoth Jushu and Some Curious Statements of Epiphanius&#8212;Being a Contribution to the Study of Christian Origins</I> (London, 1903). It is to be noted that the Talm&#363;d knows nothing of John; it evidently regards the John-Jesus movement as one and the same kind of heresy. Y. and B. may perhaps be personified types of members of certain contemporary communities or mystical groups. In &sect;54 Y. and B. are called the 'Two Gold-sons.' This reminds us of alchemical symbolism; see my tracing of 'psychical' alchemy to Babylon in <I>The Doctrine of the Subtle Body in Western Tradition</I> (London, 1919), Proem, pp. 25ff. They may have belonged to the early 'Sons of the Sun' tradition&#8212;the later Samps&aelig;ans of Epiphanius, still later in wider distribution known to the Moslim historians as Shems&#299;yeh (Shamish = the Sun). This hypothesis is strengthened by the apparently cryptic gloss Beni-Amin, 'Sons of (the) Am&#275;n' (cp. Rev. iii. 14: These things saith the Am&#275;n, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God."). I have no space here to follow up this conjecture; but L. seems to me to be, not only nodding, but fast asleep, when he assumes that the Mand&aelig;an writers were simply ignoramuses who mistook Ben-Yamin for Beni-Amin. The Heb. derivation of Benjamin is given very variously In the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the O.T. L. refers to Yaqif (clearly Jacob) as Joseph.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_36_note_4"></A><A HREF="#page_36_fr_4">4</A> Can this be camouflage for Rabbi Eliazer ben Hyrcanus, the founder of the famous Rabbinical school at Lud (Lydda) and teacher of Akiba? He flourished 70-100 A.D. R. Eliazer was imprisoned for heresy; the Talm&#363;d account connects this accusation of heresy with an interview between him and a certain Jacob of Kephar Sechania, a city in lower Galilee, who is said to have been one of the disciples of Jeshu ha-Notzri, <I>i.e.</I> J. the N&#257;z&#333;r&aelig;an (see <I>D.J.L. 100 B.C.?</I>&#8212;pp. 216 ff. for reference and discussion). But Eliazer is a name of great distinction in Pharisaic priestly tradition, especially that of the Maccab&aelig;an proto-martyr priest, the teacher of the martyred Seven Sons and the Mother in IV. <I>Maccabees</I>.</P>

But reverence for Sun-day is fundamental with the MM., and it is one of their celestial personifications. The MM. loathed idolatry and sun-worship; they worshipped Life and Light, but may have venerated the light as the symbol of that Light. The same puzzle occurs with the prayer-custom of the Essenes, who turned to the rising sun in their morning orisons. The problem we have here to face is the existence of a pre-Christian Sun-day as rigidly observed as the Jews and others kept the Sabbath, and not a 'Pagan' holy-day.</P>

Ham stole them, and hid them so successfully that his brethren were unable to find them. Ham gave them secretly to his eldest son, Chus, who made a mystery of it to his brothers and sons. When Nimrod [ = Zoroaster, see Bousset, <I>op. cit.</I>, index] reached the age of 20 years, he (Chus) clothed him with the vesture, which gave him extraordinary strength" Migne, <I>Dic. des Apocryphes</I>, ii. 1102, 1150; and see my <I>World-Mystery</I> (London, 2nd ed., 1907), &sect; 'The Soul-Vestures,' pp. 115ff.).

Again (p. 120; M. p. 100): "Mary, my mother according to matter, thou in whom I have sojourned." And again, Mary speaking (p. 120; M. p. 103): "'Grace and Truth met together,'&#8212;it is I, Mary, thy mother, and Elizabeth, mother of John, whom I have met. 'Grace' then is the power of Saba&#333;th in me, which went forth out of me, which thou art. . . . . 'Truth' on the other hand is the power in Elizabeth, which is John, who did come and hath made proclamation concerning the way of Truth [the M. Kush&#7789;&#257;] which thou art,&#8212;who hath made proclamation before thee."</P>
