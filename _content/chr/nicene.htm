A seemingly minor difference in the wording of this simple text had a
profound impact on European history. The Nicene Creed, or Symbol of Faith,
was written by the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea in 325 C.E., with
additions (the 3rd paragraph and following) by the first Council of
Constantinople (381). There is an unresolved controversy over the words 'and
the Son' (in Latin <I>filioque</I>). This language was added in 587 by the local
council of Toledo, Spain, in an attempt to combat the Arian heresy. Pope Leo
III (795-816) forbade the use of the <I>filioque</I> version and had it engraved
without 'and the Son' on the walls of St. Peter's Basillica.  After a failed
attempt to unite by marriage Charlemagne's Frankish holdings with that of
the Byzantine Empress, Charlemagne challenged Byzantinium's claim of
universal jurisdiction as the successor to Rome by claiming in 792 that
among other things, that the Byzantines had omitted the <I>filioque</I> from the
original text.  The <I>filioque</I> was finally accepted
by the Romans in the year
1014, and the revision has been part of Catholic doctrine ever since.  The
"<I>filioque</I>," the significance of Roman primacy, and geo-political conflict
led to the the Great Schism of 1053.  To this day, the Eastern Orthodox
Churches do not accept the <I>filioque</I> and raise this as one of many reasons
that prevent re-unification with the Roman Catholic Church.

<p>I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.

<p>And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten
of  the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God
of  very  God;  begotten, not made, being of one  substance  with  the
Father, by whom all things were made.

<p>Who,  for us men for our salvation, came down from heaven,  and  was
incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man; and
was  crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered  and  was
buried;  and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures;
and  ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of  the  Father;
and  He shall come again, with glory, to judge the quick and the dead;
whose kingdom shall have no end.

<p>And  I  believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of  Life;  who
proceeds from the Father <I>and the Son</I>; who with the Father
<I>and the  Son</I>
together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets.

<p>And  I believe one holy catholic and apostolic Church. I acknowledge
one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection
of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.
