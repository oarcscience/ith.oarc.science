<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou dost not understand that they were justified by faith&#8212;<SMALL>ABRAHAM</SMALL>, and <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> and all the Prophets, one after the other, who prophesied concerning the coming of the Son of God. And <SMALL>ABRAHAM</SMALL> said, "Wilt Thou in my days, O Lord, cast Thy word upon the ground?" And God said unto him, "By no means. His time hath not yet come, but I will shew thee a similitude of His coming. Get thee over the <SMALL>JORDAN</SMALL>, and dip thyself in the water as thou goest over, and arrive at the city of <SMALL>S&Acirc;L&Ecirc;M</SMALL>, where thou shalt meet <SMALL>MELCHIZEDEK</SMALL>, and I will command him to show thee the sign and similitude of Him." And <SMALL>ABRAHAM</SMALL> did this and he found <SMALL>MELCHIZEDEK</SMALL>, and he gave him the mystery of the bread and wine,<A NAME="page_200_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_200_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> that same which is celebrated in our Passover for our salvation through our Lord <SMALL>JESUS CHRIST</SMALL>. This was the desire and the joy of <SMALL>ABRAHAM</SMALL> as he went round the altar which <SMALL>MELCHIZEDEK</SMALL> had made, carrying branch and palm on the day of the Sabbath. See how he rejoiced in his belief, and see how he was justified by his belief, O blind <SMALL>JEW</SMALL>, who though having eyes seest not, and having ears hearest not, even as the Prophet <SMALL>ISAIAH</SMALL> saith concerning you, "Their eyes are blind, and their hearts are covered with darkness, so that they may not understand and God may not show compassion unto them."<A NAME="page_200_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_200_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A></P>
