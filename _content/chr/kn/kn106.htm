<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">106. <I>A Prophecy concerning the Coming of </I><SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL></H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now hearken how each one of them hath prophesied concerning Him, [for the narrative] is pleasant to hear. <SMALL>ISAIAH</SMALL> the Prophet prophesied concerning His coming and said, "A Son is born unto us. A Child is given unto us. Dominion is written upon His shoulder. He is God, strong in rule, King, great Counsellor is His name."<A NAME="page_201_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_201_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> Now the meaning of this is manifest: the Son of God is born, Whose sovereignty was written down before the world was, and He is wiser than anyone else: [this is what] he saith unto thee. And again <SMALL>ISAIAH</SMALL> prophesied and said, "Behold My servant Whom I have chosen, on Whom is the delight of My soul, and the nations shall put their confidence in Him."<A NAME="page_201_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_201_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> And these words give us to understand that <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> is the Spirit of God, the Word of the Father Who put on our flesh and was born for us: and the peoples of <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc;</SMALL> and <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> and all other nations have believed in Him. And he spake unto the people of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, and again he prophesied, saying, "Many shall follow after Thee with their loins girded up, and their backs bound with fetters, and they shall pray to Thee and worship Thee, for thou art God, and we have not recognized Thee."<A NAME="page_201_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_201_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> Now this he spake concerning the martyrs, and those who became monks in the desert and solitary monks, whose hearts were fettered with His commandment, and who prayed to Him, meaning that reward was meet for both the martyrs and the solitary monks. "And we did not recognize Thee": <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> made itself blind, and crucified Him, and refused to walk in His righteousness. And again <SMALL>ISAIAH</SMALL> prophesied and said, "God shall come, and the heathen shall put their trust in Him and shall know Him";<A NAME="page_201_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_201_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A> this meaneth that <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> shall come, and the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> shall reject Him, but the heathen shall believe



<A NAME="page_202"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 202</FONT></A>

in Him. And again he prophesied and said, "Be strong ye weak hands and tired knees, and rejoice ye hearts that are cast down, for God hath come, Who shall requite our debt, and save us. And He shall open the eyes of the blind, and He shall make the ears of the deaf to hear, and the feet that are lame shall run, and the tongues of the dumb shall speak."<A NAME="page_202_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_202_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> These words are spoken in respect of those who err in worshipping idols, and those who are dead in sin, and those whose hearts are darkened, and of you who do not know that God created you. Rejoice ye this day: He hath come Who will redeem the sin of <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL>, and make <SMALL>ADAM'S</SMALL> debt His own. He was crucified being sinless. He hath killed Death by means of His own death, and the blind see, and the lame walk, and the deaf hear, and the dumb speak unhaltingly, and besides all these things the dead are raised. This is the meaning of this prophecy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> the Prophet prophesied and said, "God shall come in visible form, and our God will not keep silence."<A NAME="page_202_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_202_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus <SMALL>JEREMIAH</SMALL> prophesied and said, "God shall come down upon the earth, and shall walk about with men like us."<A NAME="page_202_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_202_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<A NAME="page_207"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 207</FONT></A>

He made the abysses, and before the waterfloods came forth, and the beauty of the flowers appeared, and before the winds blew, God created His work before His face, and I existed conjointly with My Father."<A NAME="page_207_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_207_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus his father <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> prophesied and said, "His name was before the sun, and before the moon, generation to generation."<A NAME="page_207_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_207_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus his son <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> prophesied and said, "When He made strong the firmament above the clouds, and when He set in position the walls of the boundaries of the heavens, and when He set the sea in its appointed place, and before He founded His throne above the winds, and when He made strong the foundations of the earth, I existed conjointly with Him. I was that wherein He rejoiced continually, and day by day, and I exulted with Him at all times before His face."<A NAME="page_207_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_207_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus <SMALL>JOB</SMALL> the Prophet prophesied and said, "The face of my God is in the East, and His light is before [that of] the sun, and the nations put their trust in His Name."<A NAME="page_207_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_207_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus <SMALL>ISAIAH</SMALL> the Prophet prophesied and said, "Remember ye not the things of the past, and think not about the things of olden time; behold, I will make a new thing, which shall now spring up, so that ye may know that I make a road through the desert and water floods in the wilderness; and the beasts of the field shall follow after Me, and the young birds, and the ostriches. For I have given water in the desert, and made streams of water to flow in the wilderness, so that I may give drink to My people and to My chosen ones whom I have gotten, so that they may declare My glory, and perform My commandment."<A NAME="page_207_fr_5"></A><A HREF="#page_207_note_5"><SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> prophesied and said, "Who hath gone up into heaven and come down? And who hath gathered



<A NAME="page_208"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 208</FONT></A>

together the winds in his bosom? And who hath collected the waters in his garment? And who hath measured the waters of the sea in his hand, and the heavens on the palm of his hand? And what is his name and what is the name of his son?"<A NAME="page_208_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_208_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus <SMALL>MICAH</SMALL> the Prophet prophesied and said unto the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL>, "I have no pleasure in you, saith God Who ruleth all things. And I have no pleasure in your offerings, and I will accept no gift from your hands. For from the rising of the sun to the setting thereof shall My Name be praised among all peoples, and in all countries incense shall be offered up to my great Name among all peoples, saith Almighty God."<A NAME="page_208_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_208_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again <SMALL>MICAH</SMALL> the Prophet said, "A new covenant shall appear upon the mountain of God, and it shall be prepared upon the tops of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills, and people shall say, 'Come ye, let us go up into the mountain of God.' And many nations shall go thereto and shall say, 'Come ye, let us go up into the mountain of God,<A NAME="page_208_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_208_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> and they shall declare unto us His way, and we will walk therein.'"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> the Prophet prophesied and said, "Hearken unto Me, O My people, and I will speak unto thee, <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, and will bring testimony to thee; I am God, thy God."<A NAME="page_208_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_208_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL> the Prophet prophesied and said concerning the Trinity, "Hear, O <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, the Lord thy God is One."<A NAME="page_208_fr_5"></A><A HREF="#page_208_note_5"><SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP></A> And this is to be explained thus: Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit are One God, Whose kingdom is one, Whose dominion is one, and as One men shall worship Them in the heavens and in the earth, in the sea and in the abysses. And to Him be praise for ever and ever! Amen.</P>
