### 3. *Concerning the Kingdom of* <span class="small">ADAM</span>

   And I go up from <span class="small">ADAM</span> and I say, God is
King in truth, for Him praise is meet, and He appointed under Him <span
class="small">ADAM</span> to be king over all that He had created. And
He drove him out of the Garden, because of his apostasy through the sin
of the Serpent and the plotting of the Devil. And at that sorrowful
moment <span class="small">CAIN</span> was born, and when <span
class="small">ADAM</span> saw that the face of <span
class="small">CAIN</span> was ill-tempered (or, sullen) and his
appearance evil he was sad. And then <span class="small">ABEL</span> was
born, and when <span class="small">ADAM</span> saw that his appearance
was good and his face good-tempered he said, "This is my son, the heir
of my kingdom."
