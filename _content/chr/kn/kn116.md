### 116. *Concerning the Chariot of* <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>

   And the Archbishops answered and said unto <span
class="small">GREGORY</span>, the Worker of Wonders, "Behold now, thou
hast told us concerning the vanquisher of the enemy of <span
class="small">RÔMÊ</span>, and now \[tell us\] of the chariot of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> and whether it shall remain henceforward,
to the Coming of <span class="small">CHRIST</span>, as thou hast told us
concerning <span class="small">ZION</span>, and concerning the faith of
the people of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>, and likewise if their
chariot shall remain." And <span class="small">GREGORY</span> said unto
them, "It shall assuredly not disappear. And again, hearken ye unto me
and I will declare this unto you: A few <span class="small">JEWS</span>
shall lift up their heads against our faith in <span
class="small">NÂGRÂN</span> and in <span class="small">ARMENIA</span> in
the days after this, and this God will do by His Will so that He may
destroy them, for <span class="small">ARMENIA</span> is a territory of
<span class="small">RÔMÊ</span> and <span class="small">NÂGRÂN</span> is
a territory of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>."
