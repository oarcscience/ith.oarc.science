<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL>, or the Book of the Glory of the Kings [of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>], has been held in the highest esteem and honour throughout the length and breadth of <SMALL>ABYSSINIA</SMALL> for a thousand years at least, and even to-day it is believed by every educated man in that country to contain the true history of the origin of the Solomonic line of kings in <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, and is regarded as the final authority on the history of the conversion of the <SMALL>ETHIOPIANS</SMALL> from the worship of the sun, moon, and stars to that of the Lord God of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> appears to have been unknown in Europe until the second quarter of the sixteenth century, when scholars began to take an interest in the country of "<SMALL>PRESTER JOHN</SMALL>" through the writings of <SMALL>FRANCISCO ALVAREZ</SMALL>, chaplain to the Embassy which <SMALL>EMMANUEL</SMALL>, King of <SMALL>PORTUGAL</SMALL>, sent to <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, under the leadership of <SMALL>DON RODERIGO DE LIMA</SMALL> (1520-1527). In the collection of documents concerning this Embassy, <SMALL>ALVAREZ</SMALL> included an account of the King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, and of the manners and customs of his subjects, and a description in Portuguese of the habits of the <SMALL>ETHIOPIANS</SMALL> (alcuni costumi di esso Serenissimo <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, e del suo paese e genti, tradotta di lingua ethiopica in Portogalese);<A NAME="page_xxxi_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_xxxi_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> and in his <I>Ho Preste Joam das Indias</I> (<SMALL>COIMBRA</SMALL>, 1540), and his <I>Historia de las cosas d'Etiopia</I> (<SMALL>ANVERS</SMALL> 1557, <SMALL>SARAGOSSE</SMALL> 1561 and <SMALL>TOLEDO</SMALL> 1588) this account was greatly amplified.<A NAME="page_xxxi_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_xxxi_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of the sixteenth century, <SMALL>P. N. GODINHO</SMALL> published some traditions about King <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> and his son <SMALL>M&#276;NY&#276;L&#276;K</SMALL> or <SMALL>M&#276;NY&#276;L&Icirc;K</SMALL>, derived from the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL>,<A NAME="page_xxxii_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_xxxii_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> and further information on the subject was included by the Jesuit priest <SMALL>MANOEL ALMEIDA</SMALL> (1580-1646) in his <I>Historia ger&#772;al de Ethiopia</I>, which does not appear to have been published in its entirety. <SMALL>MANOEL ALMEIDA</SMALL> was sent out as a missionary to <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, and had abundant means of learning about the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> at first hand, and his manuscript <I>Historia</I> is a valuable work. His brother, <SMALL>APOLLINARE</SMALL>, also went out to the country as a missionary, and was, with his two companions, stoned to death in <SMALL>TIGR&Eacute;</SMALL>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still fuller information about the contents of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> was supplied by <SMALL>F. BALTHAZAR TELLEZ</SMALL> (1595-1675), the author of the <I>Historia general de Ethiopia Alta ov Preste Jo&atilde; e do que nella obraram os Padres da Companhia de <SMALL>JESUS</SMALL> composta na mesma Ethiopia pelo Padre Manoel d'Almeyda. Abreviada com nova rele&ccedil;am e methodo pelo Padre Balthezar Tellez</I>, <SMALL>COIMBRA</SMALL>, 1660, folio. The sources of his work were the histories of <SMALL>MANOEL ALMEIDA</SMALL>, <SMALL>ALFONZO MENDEZ</SMALL>, <SMALL>JERONINO LOBO</SMALL>, and Father <SMALL>PAYS</SMALL>. The <I>Historia</I> of <SMALL>TELLEZ</SMALL> was well known to <SMALL>JOB LUDOLF</SMALL>, and he refers to it several times in his <I>Historia &AElig;thiopica</I>, which was published at <SMALL>FRANKFORT</SMALL> in 1681, but it is pretty certain that he had no first-hand knowledge of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> as a whole. Though he regarded much of its contents as fabulous, he was prepared to accept the statement of <SMALL>TELLEZ</SMALL> as to the great reputation and popularity which the book enjoyed in <SMALL>ABYSSINIA</SMALL>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little, apparently, was heard in Europe about the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> until the close of the eighteenth century when <SMALL>JAMES BRUCE</SMALL> of <SMALL>KINNAIRD</SMALL> (1730-1794), the famous African traveller, published an account of his travels in search of the sources of the <SMALL>NILE</SMALL>. When he was leaving



<A NAME="page_xxxiii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxiii</FONT></A>

<SMALL>GONDAR</SMALL>, <SMALL>R&Acirc;S MICHAEL</SMALL>, the all-powerful Waz&icirc;r of King <SMALL>TAKLA HAYM&Acirc;N&Ocirc;T</SMALL>, gave him several most valuable Ethiopic manuscripts, and among them was a copy of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> to which he attached great importance. During the years that <SMALL>BRUCE</SMALL> lived in <SMALL>ABYSSINIA</SMALL> he learned how highly this work was esteemed among all classes of <SMALL>ABYSSINIANS</SMALL>, and in the third edition of his <I>Travels</I><A NAME="page_xxxiii_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_xxxiii_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> (vol. iii, pp. 411-416) there appeared a description of its contents, the first to be published in any European language. Not content with this manuscript <SMALL>BRUCE</SMALL> brought away with him a copy of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> which he had made for himself, and in due course he gave both manuscripts to the Bodleian Library, where they are known as "Bruce 93" and "Bruce 87" respectively. The former, which is the "Liber Axumea" of <SMALL>BRUCE'S</SMALL> <I>Travels</I>, was described at great length by <SMALL>DILLMANN</SMALL>,<A NAME="page_xxxiii_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_xxxiii_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> who to his brief description of the latter added a transcript of its important colophon.<A NAME="page_xxxiii_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_xxxiii_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> Thanks to <SMALL>DILLMANN</SMALL>, who printed the headings of all the chapters of the <I>F&#277;tha Nagasti</I> in the original Ethiopic, there was no longer any doubt about the exact nature and contents of the work, though there was nothing in it to show exactly when and by whom the work was compiled.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1870 (?) <SMALL>FRANCIS PR&AElig;TORIUS</SMALL> published,<A NAME="page_xxxiii_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_xxxiii_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A> with a Latin translation, the Ethiopic text of Chapters xix to xxxii of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> edited from the manuscript at Berlin (Orient. 395), which <SMALL>LEPSIUS</SMALL> acquired from <SMALL>DOMINGO LORDA</SMALL>, and sent to the <SMALL>K&Ouml;NIGLICHE BIBLIOTHEK</SMALL> in 1843. To the Berlin text he added the variant readings supplied from the MSS. Orient. 818 and 819 in the

<SMALL>BRITISH MUSEUM</SMALL> by Professor <SMALL>W. WRIGHT</SMALL> of <SMALL>CAMBRIDGE</SMALL>. In 1877 <SMALL>WRIGHT</SMALL> published a full description of the MS. of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> in the <SMALL>MA&#7730;DAL&Acirc;</SMALL> Collection in the <SMALL>BRITISH MUSEUM</SMALL>. The work of Praetorius made known for the first time the exact form of the Ethiopian legend that makes the King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> to be a descendant of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, King of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, by <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL>, the Queen of <SMALL>&#8217;AZ&Ecirc;B</SMALL>, who is better known as the "Queen of <SMALL>SHEBA</SMALL>".</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August, 1868, the great collection of Ethiopic manuscripts, which the British Army brought away from <SMALL>MA&#7730;DAL&Acirc;</SMALL> after the defeat and suicide of King <SMALL>THEODORE</SMALL>, was brought to the <SMALL>BRITISH MUSEUM</SMALL>, and among them were two fine copies of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL>. Later these were numbered Oriental 818 and Oriental 819 respectively, and were described very fully and carefully by Wright in his <I>Catalogue of the Ethiopic MSS. in the British Museum</I>, London, 1877,<A NAME="page_xxxiv_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_xxxiv_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> No. cccxci, p. 297, and in the <I>Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl&auml;ndischen Gesellschaft</I>, Bd. xxiv, pp. 614-615. It was the fate of Oriental 819, a fine manuscript which was written in the reign of <SMALL>&#8217;&Icirc;Y&Acirc;S&Ucirc;</SMALL> I, <SMALL>A.D.</SMALL> 1682-1706, to return to <SMALL>ABYSSINIA</SMALL>, and this came about in the following manner. On 10 Aug., 1872, Prince <SMALL>KASA</SMALL>, who was subsequently crowned as King <SMALL>JOHN IV</SMALL>, wrote to Earl <SMALL>GRANVILLE</SMALL> thus: "And now again I have another thing to explain to you: that there was a Picture called <SMALL>QURATA REZOO</SMALL>, which is a Picture of our Lord and Saviour <SMALL>JESUS CHRIST</SMALL>, and was found with many books at <SMALL>MAGDALA</SMALL> by the English. This Picture King <SMALL>THEODORE</SMALL> took from <SMALL>GONDAR</SMALL> to <SMALL>MAGDALA</SMALL>, and it is now in England; all round the Picture is gold, and the midst of it coloured.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Again there is a book called <SMALL>KIVERA NEGUST</SMALL> (i.e. <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL>), which contains the Law of the whole of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, and the names of the <SMALL>SHUMS</SMALL> (i.e. Chiefs),



<A NAME="page_xxxv"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxv</FONT></A>

Churches, and Provinces are in this book. I pray you will find out who has got this book, and send it to me, for in my Country my people will not obey my orders without it".</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a copy of this letter was sent to the <SMALL>BRITISH MUSEUM</SMALL> the Trustees decided to grant King <SMALL>JOHN'S</SMALL> request, and the manuscript was restored to him on 14 December, 1872. King <SMALL>JOHN'S</SMALL> letter proves that very great importance was attached to the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> by the Ethiopian peoples, even in the second half of the nineteenth century. <SMALL>M. HUGUES LE ROUX</SMALL>, a French envoy from the President of the French Republic to <SMALL>MENYELEK II</SMALL>, King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, went to <SMALL>ADDIS ALEM</SMALL> where the king was staying, in order to see this manuscript and to obtain his permission to translate it into French. Having made his request to <SMALL>MENYELEK II</SMALL> personally the king made a reply, which <SMALL>M. LE ROUX</SMALL> translates thus: "Je suis d'avis qu'un peuple ne se d&eacute;fend pas seulement avec ses armes, mais avec ses livres. Celui dont vous parlez est la fiert&eacute; de ce Royaume. Depuis moi, l'Empereur, jusqu'au plus pauvre soldat qui marche dans les chemins, tous les &Eacute;thiopiens seront heureux que ce livre soit traduit dans la langue fran&ccedil;aise et port&eacute; &agrave; la connaissance des amis que nous avons dans le monde. Ainsi l'on verra clairement quels liens nous unissent avec le peuple de Dieu, quels tr&eacute;sors ont &eacute;t&eacute; confi&eacute;s &agrave; notre garde. On comprendra mieux pourquoi le secours de Dieu ne nous a jamais manqu&eacute; contre les ennemis qui nous attaquaient". The king then gave orders that the manuscript was to be fetched from <SMALL>ADDIS ABEBA</SMALL>, where the monks tried to keep it on the pretext of copying the text, and in less than a week it was placed in the hands of <SMALL>M. LE ROUX</SMALL>, who could hardly believe his eyes. Having described the manuscript and noted on the last folio the words, "This volume was returned to the King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> by order of the Trustees of the <SMALL>BRITISH MUSEUM</SMALL>, Dec. 14th, 1872. <SMALL>J. WINTER JONES</SMALL>, Principal

Librarian". <SMALL>M. LE ROUX</SMALL> says: "Il n'y avait plus de doute possible: le livre que je tenais dans mes mains &eacute;tait bien cette version de l'histoire de la Reine de Saba et de Salomon, que N&eacute;gus et Pr&ecirc;tres d'&Eacute;thiopie consid&egrave;rent comme le plus authentique de toutes celles qui circulent dans les biblioth&egrave;ques europ&eacute;ennes et dans les monast&egrave;tes abyssins. C'&eacute;tait le livre que Th&eacute;odoros avait cach&eacute; sous son oreiller, la nuit o&ugrave; il se suicida, celui que les soldats anglais avaient emport&eacute; &agrave; Londres, qu'un ambassadeur rendit &agrave; l'Empereur Jean, que ce m&ecirc;me Jean feuilleta dans sa tente, le matin du jour o&ugrave; il tomba sous les cimeterres des Mahdistes, celui que les moines avaient d&eacute;rob&eacute;".<A NAME="page_xxxvi_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_xxxvi_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> With the help of a friend <SMALL>M. LE ROUX</SMALL> translated several of the Chapters of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL>, and in due course published his translation.<A NAME="page_xxxvi_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_xxxvi_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The catalogues of the Ethiopic MSS. in <SMALL>OXFORD</SMALL>, <SMALL>LONDON</SMALL> and <SMALL>PARIS</SMALL>, which had been published by <SMALL>DILLMANN</SMALL>, <SMALL>WRIGHT</SMALL> and <SMALL>ZOTENBERG</SMALL>, supplied a good deal of information about the contents of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> in general, but scholars felt that it was impossible to judge of the literary and historical value of the work by transcription and translations of the headings of the chapters only. In 1882 under the auspices of the Bavarian Government, <SMALL>DR. C. BEZOLD</SMALL> undertook to prepare an edition of the Ethiopic text edited from the best MSS., with a German translation, which the <SMALL>ROYAL BAVARIAN ACADEMY</SMALL> made arrangements to publish. After much unavoidable delay this work appeared in 1909, and is entitled <I>Kebra Nagast. Die Herrlichkeit der K&ouml;nige (Abhandlungen der K&ouml;niglich Bayerischen Akademie</I>, Band XXIII, Abth. 1, Munich, 1909 [Band LXXVII of the <I>Denkschriften</I>]). The text is prefaced by a learned introduction, which was greatly appreciated by Orientalists to whom the edition was specially addressed. The



<A NAME="page_xxxvii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxvii</FONT></A>

chief authority for the Ethiopic text in <SMALL>BEZOLD'S</SMALL> edition is the now famous manuscript which was sent as a gift to <SMALL>LOUIS PHILIPPE</SMALL> by <SMALL>S&Acirc;HLA</SMALL> (or <SMALL>S&Acirc;HL&Ucirc;</SMALL>) <SMALL>D&#276;NG&#276;L</SMALL>, King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, who died early in 1855. According to <SMALL>ZOTENBERG</SMALL> (<I>Catalogue des manuscrits &Eacute;thiopiens</I>, p. 6) this manuscript must belong to the thirteenth century; if this be so it is probably the oldest Ethiopic manuscript in existence. Though there seems to be no really good reason for assigning this very early date to the manuscript, there can be no doubt as to its being the oldest known Codex of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL>, and therefore <SMALL>BEZOLD</SMALL> was fully justified in making its text the base of his edition of that work. I have collated the greater part of the <SMALL>BRITISH MUSEUM</SMALL> Codex, Oriental 818, with his printed text, and though the variants are numerous they are not of great importance, in fact, as is the case in several other Codices of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL>, they are due chiefly to the haste or carelessness or fatigue of the scribe. As <SMALL>BEZOLD'S</SMALL> text represents the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> in the form that the Ethiopian priests and scribes have considered authoritative, I have made the English translation which is printed in the following pages from it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, none of the Codices of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> gives us any definite information about the compiler of the work&#8212;for it certainly is a compilation&#8212;or the time when he wrote, or the circumstances under which it was compiled. <SMALL>DILLMANN</SMALL>, the first European scholar who had read the whole book in the original Ethiopic, contented himself with saying in 1848, "de vero compositionis tempore nihil liquet" (<I>Catalogus</I>, p. 72), but later he thought it might be as old as the fourteenth century. <SMALL>ZOTENBERG</SMALL> (<I>Catalogue</I>, p. 222) was inclined to think that "it was composed soon after the restoration of the so-called Solomonic line of kings", that is to say, soon after the throne of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> was occupied by <SMALL>TASF&Acirc; &#8217;&Icirc;YAS&Ucirc;S</SMALL>,or <SMALL>Y&#276;K&Ucirc;N&Ocirc; &#8217;AML&Acirc;K</SMALL>, who reigned from <SMALL>A.M.</SMALL> 6762-77, i.e. <SMALL>A.D.</SMALL> 1270-1285. A Colophon,



<A NAME="page_xxxviii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxviii</FONT></A>

(see pp. 228, 229)which is found in several of the Codices of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> in <SMALL>OXFORD</SMALL>, <SMALL>LONDON</SMALL> and <SMALL>PARIS</SMALL>, states that the Ethiopic text was translated from the Arabic version, which, in turn, was translated from the Coptic. The Arabic translation was, it continues, made by <SMALL>&#8217;ABU &#8217;L-&#8219;IZZ</SMALL> and <SMALL>&#8217;ABU &#8217;L-FARAJ</SMALL>, in the "year of mercy" 409, during the reign of <SMALL>GABRA MAS&#7730;AL</SMALL> (<SMALL>&#8217;AMDA SEY&Ocirc;N I</SMALL>), i.e. between <SMALL>A.D.</SMALL> 1314 and 1344, when <SMALL>GEORGE</SMALL> was Patriarch of <SMALL>ALEXANDRIA</SMALL>. These statements are clear enough and definite enough, yet <SMALL>DILLMANN</SMALL> did not believe them, but thought that the whole Colophon was the result of the imagination of some idle scribe (ab otioso quodam librario inventa). The statements about the Ethiopic version being made from the Coptic through the Arabic, he treated as obvious fictions (plane fictitia esse), and he condemned the phrasing of the Colophon because he considered its literary style inferior to that used in the narrative of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> itself (dictio hujus subscriptionis pessima est, et ab oratione eleganti libri ipsius quam maxime differt). <SMALL>ZOTENBERG</SMALL> (<I>Catalogue</I>, p. 223, col. 1) a very competent scholar, saw no reason for doubting the truth of the statements in the Colophon generally, but thought it possible that an Arab author might have supplied the fundamental facts of the narrative, and that the author or authors of the Ethiopic version stated that the original source of their work was a Coptic archetype in order to give it an authority and importance which it would not otherwise possess. On the other hand, <SMALL>WRIGHT</SMALL> merely regarded the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> as an "apocryphal work", and judging from the list of kings at the end of the work in Oriental 818, fol. 46B,which ends with <SMALL>Y&#276;KW&#276;N&Ocirc; &#8217;AML&Acirc;K</SMALL>, who died in 1344, concluded that it was a product of the fourteenth century (<I>Catalogue</I>, p. 301, col. 2).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A careful study of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL>, made whilst translating the work into English, has convinced me that



<A NAME="page_xxxix"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxix</FONT></A>

the opening statements in the Colophon are substantially correct, and that it is quite possible that in its original form the Arabic version of the book was translated from Coptic MSS. belonging to the Patriarchal Library at <SMALL>ALEXANDRIA</SMALL>, and copies of this Arabic translation, probably enlarged and greatly supplemented by the scribes in the various monasteries of <SMALL>EGYPT</SMALL>, would soon find their way into <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> or <SMALL>ABYSSINIA</SMALL>, vi&acirc; the <SMALL>BLUE NILE</SMALL>. The principal theme of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL>, <I>i.e.</I> the descent of the Kings of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> from <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, King of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, and the "Queen of the South, or the "Queen of <SMALL>SHEBA</SMALL>", was certainly well known in <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> for centuries before the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> was compiled, but the general treatment of it in this work was undoubtedly greatly influenced by supplementary legends and additions, which in their simplest forms seem to me to have been derived from Coptic and even Syrian writers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known that the Solomonic line of kings continued to rule over <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> until that somewhat mythical woman <SMALL>ESTHER</SMALL>, or <SMALL>JUDITH</SMALL> as some call her, succeeded in dethroning <SMALL>DELNA&#8217;AD</SMALL> and placing on the throne <SMALL>MAR&Acirc; TAKLA H&Acirc;YM&Acirc;N&Ocirc;T</SMALL>, the first of the eleven <SMALL>Z&Acirc;GU&Ecirc;</SMALL> kings, who dispossessed the Solomonic kings for three hundred and fifty-four years (<SMALL>A.D.</SMALL> 914-1268) and reigned at <SMALL>AKS&Ucirc;M</SMALL>. Written accounts of the descent of the kings of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> from <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> must have existed in <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> before the close of the ninth century <SMALL>A.D.</SMALL> and these were, no doubt, drawn up in Ethiopic and in Arabic. During the persecution of the Christians in <SMALL>EGYPT</SMALL> and <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> by the <SMALL>MU&#7716;AMMADANS</SMALL> in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries, many churches and their libraries of manuscripts perished. We may, however, be sure that the Solomonic kings, who settled in the province of <SMALL>SHOA</SMALL> during the period of the <SMALL>Z&Acirc;GU&Ecirc;</SMALL> domination, managed to preserve chronological lists and other historical documents that contained the Annals of their predecessors.</P>

<P>



<A NAME="page_xl"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xl</FONT></A>

</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the Colophon mentions <SMALL>&#8217;ABU &#8217;L-&#8219;IZZ</SMALL> and <SMALL>&#8217;ABU &#8217;L-FARAJ</SMALL> as being concerned with translating the book into Arabic, and makes one <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL> (?), who was apparently the Ethiopian translator, ask why they did not translate it into Ethiopic. In answer to this question he says that the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> appeared during the period of the <SMALL>Z&Acirc;GU&Ecirc;</SMALL> rule, when it is obvious that the publication of any work that supported the claims of the Solomonic kings would meet with a very unfavourable reception, and cause the death of its editors and translators. Therefore it is fairly certain that the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> existed in Arabic in some form during the three and a half centuries of the <SMALL>Z&Acirc;GU&Ecirc;</SMALL> rule, and that no attempt was made to multiply copies of it in Ethiopic until the restoration of the line of Solomonic kings in the days of <SMALL>Y&#276;K&Ucirc;N&Ocirc; &#8217;AML&Acirc;K</SMALL> (<SMALL>A.D.</SMALL> 1270-1285). The Ethiopic work as we know it now is probably in much the same state as it was in the days of <SMALL>GABRA MAS&#7730;AL</SMALL>. (<SMALL>&#8219;AMDA &#7778;&#276;Y&Ocirc;N</SMALL>) in the first half of the fourteenth century of our era. Of <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL> we unfortunately know nothing, but there seem to be no good grounds for attributing the complete authorship of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> to him. Yet he was evidently not merely a scribe or copyist, and when he speaks of the greatness of the toil which he undertook for the sake of the glory of the heavenly <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, and <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> and her king, he seems to suggest that he was the general redactor or editor who directed the work of his devoted companions <SMALL>YAMHARANA-&#8217;AB</SMALL>, <SMALL>&#7716;EZBA- KREST&Ocirc;S</SMALL>, <SMALL>ANDREW</SMALL>, <SMALL>PHILIP</SMALL>, and <SMALL>MA&#7716;&Acirc;R&Icirc;-&#8217;AB</SMALL>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, however important the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> may have been considered by the Ethiopians in bygone centuries, and notwithstanding the almost superstitious awe with which the book is still regarded in <SMALL>ABYSSINIA</SMALL>, we are hardly justified in accepting it as a connected historical document. But it is undoubtedly a very fine work, and many sections of it merit careful consideration

and study. For many of the statements in it there are historical foundations, and the greater part of the narrative is based upon legends and sayings and traditions, many of which are exceedingly ancient. The legends and traditions are derived from many sources, and can be traced to the Old Testament and Chaldean <SMALL>TARG&Ucirc;MS</SMALL>, to Syriac works like the "Book of the Bee", to Coptic lives of saints, to ancient &#7730;ur&#8217;&acirc;nic stories and commentaries, to apocryphal books like the "Book of <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL> and <SMALL>EVE</SMALL>", the "Book of <SMALL>ENOCH</SMALL>", "<SMALL>K&Ucirc;F&Acirc;L&Ecirc;</SMALL>", the "Instructions of <SMALL>ST. PETER</SMALL> to his disciple <SMALL>CLEMENT</SMALL>" ( i.e. the <SMALL>&#7730;AL&Ecirc;M&#276;N&#7788;&Ocirc;S</SMALL>), the Life of <SMALL>&#7716;ANN&Acirc;</SMALL>, the Mother of the Virgin Mary", the "Book of the Pearl", and the "Ascension of <SMALL>ISAIAH</SMALL>", &amp;c. Side by side with the extracts from these works we have long sections in which works attributed to <SMALL>GREGORY THAUMATURGUS</SMALL>, to <SMALL>TIMOTHEUS</SMALL> (?), Patriarch of <SMALL>CONSTANTINOPLE</SMALL>, and to <SMALL>CYRIL</SMALL> are quoted at great length.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the author, or compiler, and the later editors of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> (no matter what its original form may have been), was to glorify <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> by narrating the history of the coming of the "spiritual and heavenly <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>", the Tabernacle of the Law of the God of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, of her own free will from <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> to <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, and to make it quite clear that the King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> was descended from <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, the son of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, King of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, and through him from Abraham and the early Patriarchs. But <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> also was descended from <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> and the early Patriarchs, and he was the Son of God, so the King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> being a kinsman of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> was also a son of God, and he was therefore both God and king to his people. The <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> was intended to make the people of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> believe that their country was specially chosen by God to be the new home of the spiritual and heavenly <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, of which His chosen people the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> had become unworthy. This <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> existed originally in an immaterial form in heaven, where it



<A NAME="page_xlii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xlii</FONT></A>

was the habitation of God. <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL> made, under Divine directions, a copy of it in wood and gold, and placed in it the Two Tables of the Law, the pot of manna, the rod of <SMALL>AARON</SMALL>; and the <SMALL>SHECHINAH</SMALL> dwelt on it and in it. This material copy was called "<SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, the Tabernacle of the Law of God". When <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> finished building his Temple <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> was established therein in the Holy of Holies, and from it God made known His commands when He visited the Temple. It was at all times held to be the visible emblem of God Almighty and the material duplicate of the immaterial <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> in heaven.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fame of the wisdom of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> reached the ends of the earth, chiefly because he traded with merchants from the sea coast and from the countries to the south of <SMALL>PALESTINE</SMALL> on each side of the <SMALL>RED SEA</SMALL>. These merchants brought the precious woods and stones, and the scents, and the spices, and the rich stuffs and other objects with which he decorated the Temple and his own palace, and when their caravans returned home their servants described to eager listeners the great works that the King of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> was carrying out in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>. Among the masters, or leaders, of these caravans was one <SMALL>T&Acirc;MR&Icirc;N</SMALL>, who managed the business affairs of a "Queen of the South", whom Arab writers call "<SMALL>BALK&Icirc;S</SMALL>", and Ethiopian writers "<SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL>"; but neither of these names is ancient, and it is very doubtful if either represents in any way the true name of the southern queen. It is doubtful also if she was an Ethiopian, and it is far more probable that her home was <SMALL>SH&#276;BH&Acirc;</SMALL>, or <SMALL>SABA</SMALL>, or <SMALL>SHEBA</SMALL>, in the south-west of <SMALL>ARABIA</SMALL>. As she was a worshipper of the sun she was probably a princess among the <SMALL>SABAEANS</SMALL>. On the other hand, her ancestors may have been merely settlers in <SMALL>ARABIA</SMALL>, and some of them of Ethiopian origin. The <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> says that she was a very beautiful, bright, and intelligent woman, but tells us nothing about her family. A manuscript at <SMALL>OXFORD</SMALL> (see <SMALL>DILLMANN</SMALL>,



<A NAME="page_xliii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xliii</FONT></A>

<I>Catalogus Bibl. Bodl.</I>, p. 26), says that five kings reigned in <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> before <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL>, viz. <SMALL>AR&Acirc;W&Icirc;</SMALL> 400 years, <SMALL>ANG&Acirc;B&Ocirc;</SMALL> 200 years, <SMALL>GIEDUR</SMALL> 100 years, <SMALL>SIEBAD&Ocirc;</SMALL> 50 years, and <SMALL>KAWN&Acirc;SY&Acirc;</SMALL> 1 year. If these kings were indeed her ancestors she was probably a native of some country on the western shore of the <SMALL>RED SEA</SMALL>. Be this as it may, she must have been a woman of great enterprise and intelligence, for having heard what <SMALL>T&Acirc;MR&Icirc;N</SMALL>, the captain of her caravans, had told her about <SMALL>SOLOMON'S</SMALL> wisdom, she determined to go to <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> and to put to him a series of difficult questions that were puzzling her.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> arrived in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, she lodged in the splendid quarters which <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> prepared for her, and she had frequent opportunities of conversing with the King. The more she saw him the more she was impressed with the handsomeness of his person, and with piety and wisdom, and with the eloquence of his speech, which he uttered in a low, musical and sympathetic voice. She spent several months in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> as the King's guest, and one night after a great and splendid banquet which <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> gave to the notables of his kingdom, in her honour, he took her to wife. When <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> knew that she was with child, she bade farewell to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, and having received from him a ring as a token, she returned to her own country, where her son <SMALL>M&#276;NY&#276;L&#276;K</SMALL>, or <SMALL>M&#276;NY&#276;L&Icirc;K</SMALL>, was born. In Ethiopic literature this son is often called <SMALL>WALDA-TABB&Icirc;B</SMALL>, i.e. "son of the wise man" (<SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>), or <SMALL>&#8217;&#276;BNA &#7716;AK&Icirc;M</SMALL>, or <SMALL>BAYNA-LE&#7716;K&#276;M</SMALL>, i.e. <SMALL>IBN AL-&#7716;AK&Icirc;M</SMALL>, or "the son of the wise man". When the boy reached early manhood he pressed <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> to allow him to go to see his father <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, and his importunity was so great that at length she gave him the ring which <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> had given her, and sent him thither under the care of <SMALL>T&Acirc;MR&Icirc;N</SMALL>. On his arrival at <SMALL>G&Acirc;Z&Acirc;</SMALL> the people in the city and everywhere in the district recognized his striking likeness to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, and almost royal honours were paid to him by



<A NAME="page_xliv"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xliv</FONT></A>

them. The same thing happened in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, and when the officials of <SMALL>SOLOMON'S</SMALL> palace were leading him to the presence chamber all the household knew without telling that a son was being taken in to his father. Father and son fell into each other's arms when they met, and the son had no need to prove his identity by producing the ring which his father had given to his beloved <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL>, for <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> proclaimed straightway the young man's parentage, and made him to occupy the royal throne with him, after he had arrayed him in royal apparel.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> spared no pains in providing both instruction and amusement for <SMALL>BAYNA-L&#276;HK&#276;M</SMALL> (<SMALL>BIN &#8217;L-&#7716;AK&Icirc;M</SMALL>) whilst he was in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, for he hoped to keep him with him; but after a few months the young man was eager to get back to his mother and to his own country, and <SMALL>T&Acirc;MR&Icirc;N</SMALL>, the leader of <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;'S</SMALL> caravans, wanted to be gone. <SMALL>BAYNA-L&#276;HK&#276;M</SMALL>, or <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL>, as we may now call him, saw that <SMALL>REHOBOAM</SMALL> must succeed <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> on the throne of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, and had no wish to occupy the subordinate position of a second son in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, and he therefore pressed <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> to give him leave to depart. When the King had arranged that the elder sons of his nobles should accompany <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> on his return to his mother's capital, <SMALL>DABRA M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL>, and had arranged with <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> for the establishment of a duplicate Jewish kingdom in <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, he permitted him to depart. When <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> was in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> she learned that the Tabernacle <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> in the Temple of <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> was the abode of the God of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, and the place where God Almighty was pleased to dwell, and in her letter to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> she begged him to send her, as a holy talisman, a portion of the fringe of the covering of the Tabernacle. <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> told <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> that he would grant <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;'S</SMALL> request, but this satisfied neither <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> nor his nobles, and, to speak briefly, <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> and <SMALL>T&Acirc;MR&Icirc;N</SMALL> and the eldest sons of the Jewish notables who



<A NAME="page_xlv"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xlv</FONT></A>

were destined to help <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> to found his kingdom in <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, entered into a conspiracy together to steal the Tabernacle <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> and to carry it off to <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>. Their object was to keep the God of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> with them, and this they expected to be able to effect by stealing the Tabernacle made of gold and wood (according to the pattern of the original Spirit-Tabernacle in heaven) which contained the Two Tables of the Law, the pot of manna, <SMALL>AARON'S</SMALL> rod, &amp;c. One of the conspirators who had access to the chamber in which the Tabernacle <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> rested, removed it from under its curtain, and substituted a construction in wood of exactly the same size and shape, which he had caused to be made for the purpose. The theft was not discovered until <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL>, and <SMALL>T&Acirc;MR&Icirc;N</SMALL>, and their company of young <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> and <SMALL>ETHIOPIANS</SMALL> were well on their road to the <SMALL>RED SEA</SMALL>, and though <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> sent out swift horsemen to overtake them and cut them off, and himself followed with all the speed possible, the thieves made good their escape, and the King of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> returned to <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> in great grief. In due course <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> reached his mother's capital, and he and the Tabernacle <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> were received with frantic rejoicings, and <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> having abdicated in favour of her son, <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> established in <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> a kingdom modelled on that of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, and introduced into his country the Laws of God and the admonitions of <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL> and the social rules and regulations with which the name of the great Lawgiver was associated in those days.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> tells us nothing about <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> after his coronation, except that he carried on one or two campaigns against the enemies of his country, and the book is silent in respect of Queen <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;'S</SMALL> history after her voluntary abdication. The author seems to expect his readers to assume that <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> was ruled over by descendants of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> and Queen <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> from the tenth century before <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> to about the tenth century



<A NAME="page_xlvi"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xlvi</FONT></A>

<SMALL>A.D.</SMALL>, i.e. for about two thousand years, and that the religion, laws, social customs, &amp;c., of the <SMALL>ETHIOPIANS</SMALL> were substantially those of the Hebrews in <SMALL>PALESTINE</SMALL> under the kings of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>. In connection with this assumption reference may be made here briefly to a series of chapters which now form part of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL>, in which the author endeavours to prove that the kings of the <SMALL>MOABITES</SMALL>, <SMALL>PHILISTINES</SMALL>, <SMALL>EGYPTIANS</SMALL>, <SMALL>PERSIANS</SMALL>, <SMALL>BABYLONIANS</SMALL> and the <SMALL>BYZANTINES</SMALL>, are of Semitic origin. The fantastic legends which he invented or reproduced contain much falsified history and bad philology, but it would be interesting to know their source and their author; these chapters seem to suggest that he was a Semite, probably a Jew.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another group of chapters, which can hardly have formed a part of the oldest version of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL>, the author summarizes the prophecies in the Old Testament that concern the Coming of the Messiah, and applies them to <SMALL>JESUS CHRIST</SMALL> with very considerable skill. And he devotes much space to the <SMALL>VIRGIN MARY</SMALL>, and quotes numerous passages from the Old Testament, with the view of identifying her symbolically with the Tabernacle of the Covenant.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<I>Here is</I>] <I>The Explanation of the Reason for the Transfer of the Kingdom of </I><SMALL>DAVID</SMALL><I> from his Son </I><SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL><I>, King of </I><SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL><I>, to the Country of the Negus, that is to say, to </I><SMALL>ABYSSINIA</SMALL>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Lord, praise be unto Him! wished <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> to build the House of the Lord in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, after the death of his father <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, the son of <SMALL>JESSE</SMALL>, who had



<A NAME="page_xlvii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xlvii</FONT></A>

reigned over the children of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, and <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, in accordance with his most excellent desire, began to build the House of the Lord, praise be unto Him! <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> the King gave the command that the stones for the building should be hewn in immense sizes. But the workmen were unable to hew such large blocks of stone, and their tools broke when they attempted the work, and they cried out to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> the King and besought him to think out in his wisdom some plan for lightening their labour. And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> entreated God, the bestower of wisdom, to suggest some means to him. And behold, <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> summoned the hunters and commanded them to bring a young Rukh bird, and in accordance with his orders they brought a young Rukh bird. And he commanded them likewise to bring a brass pot with a space inside it sufficiently large to contain the Rukh bird; and the pot had three legs, each one cubit in height, and it stood upon the ground. Then <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> commanded them to set down the Rukh bird in the palace and to put the brass pot over it, but the wings of the Rukh bird protruded from under the aforementioned pot, and raised it above the ground. Now when the [mother] Rukh bird returned to her nest in the high mountains, and did not find her young one there, she was disturbed, and she flew round and round over the earth seeking for it. And she flew over <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> and saw her young one under the aforementioned pot, but had not the power to seize it. And she mounted up into the heights and went towards the Paradise of God, in the eastern part of Eden, and she found below Paradise a piece of wood which had been cast down there as if for her to carry away. And then she seized it, and by reason of her great sorrow for her young one she took no rest until she had brought it to <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, and hurled it down upon the brass pot. And by the might of God a miracle took place forthwith, for the pot split into two halves, and the mother Rukh saw her young, and caught it up and



<A NAME="page_xlviii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xlviii</FONT></A>

bore it off to her nest. And when <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> and all the children of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> saw this miracle, with a loud voice they praised the Almighty (or, the Governor of the Universe), Who had bestowed upon a bird that was not endowed with reasoning powers the instinct to do that which human beings could not do. And straightway King <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> commanded the stone-masons to take that piece of holy and blessed wood, and, when they had marked out and measured the stone which they wished to split, to lay the afore-mentioned piece of wood on the place marked. And when they had done this, by the might of God the stone split wheresoever they wished it to split, and they found their work easy. Then <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> became certain in his mind that the Governor of the Universe regarded the building of the Holy Temple with favour. And when the construction of the Temple was finished, the afore-mentioned piece of wood remained in the entrance chamber of the forecourt of the porch, and as the building of the Temple had stopped the operative power of the afore-mentioned piece of wood came to an end, but it was still held in respect.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now God, praise be unto Him! having willed that the kingdom of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> and his son <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> should be transferred to the blessed land of <SMALL>ABYSSINIA</SMALL>, stirred up the Queen of that country to make a journey to <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> to hear some of the wisdom of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, even as the Holy Gospel saith, "The Queen of the South shall rise up in the judgement and shall judge this generation, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>".<A NAME="page_xlviii_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_xlviii_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> And behold, from the earliest times, the kingdom of <SMALL>ABYSSINIA</SMALL> was ruled over by royal princesses. And when the mother of this Queen was with child of her she saw a fat and handsome-looking goat, and she looked upon him with greedy desire, and said, "How handsome the beast is! And how handsome its



<A NAME="page_xlix"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xlix</FONT></A>

feet are!" And she longed for it after the manner of women who are with child. And when the afore-mentioned daughter was fashioned completely in the womb of her mother, she had one foot like the foot of a man and another like the foot of a goat. Great and exalted be the Creator of the Universe, Who is to be praised! And when the mother of the Queen had brought forth this extraordinary being, and had reared her, and the maiden was ready for marriage, she (i.e. the maiden) did not want to marry any man because of her malformed foot; and she continued in her virginity until she began to reign. And when the thought to visit <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> to hear his wisdom rose in her mind&#8212;as has already been mentioned&#8212;this had already been ordained in the wisdom of God, praise be unto Him! so that the kingdom of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> might last to the end of the world according to the word of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> by the Holy Ghost, "The Lord hath sworn a true oath to <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> from which He will never turn aside: Of the fruit of thy loins I will seat upon thy throne. If they will keep the allegiance of My Covenant and of My testimony which I shall teach them, their children shall sit upon thy throne for ever".<A NAME="page_xlix_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_xlix_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> And besides this passage there are many other passages in the Psalms and in the other Books that refer to this [oath]. This passage nevertheless showeth also that the kingdom was to be rent from the children of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>; and since they changed [the Covenant], and did not observe the truth, and ceased to believe in Him Who was expected, God rent from them Prophecy, Priesthood, and Sovereignty.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the afore-mentioned Queen arrived in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, and <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> the King had heard of it, and was quite certain from the information, which he had received from his spies, that one of her feet was the foot of a goat, he planned a cunning plan in his wisdom, whereby he might be able to see her foot without asking



<A NAME="page_l"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. l</FONT></A>

[her to show it to him]. He placed his throne by the side of the courtyard of the Temple, and he ordered his servants to open the sluices so that the courtyard of the Temple might be filled with water. This was done, and the aforementioned piece of wood that was in the courtyard, having been brought there by the eagle (<I>sic</I>) from below Paradise, was submerged by the water, but no one noticed this thing which had been decreed aforetime by the wisdom of God. And behold when the Queen arrived at the gate of the Temple&#8212;now she was riding&#8212;she found the water there, and she determined to ride into the presence of King <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> on her beast, but they made her to know that this was the door of the House of God, and that no one whatsoever might enter it riding on a beast. And they caused her to dismount from her beast, and her servants who were in attendance upon her supported her; and she stretched out her hand and drew up the lower parts of her cloak and her garments beneath it so that she might step into the water. Thus <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> saw her feet without asking her [to show them to him]. And behold, she stepped into the water in the courtyard, and her foot touched that afore-mentioned piece of wood, and as the foot that was fashioned like the foot of a goat touched the wood, the Might of God made itself manifest, and the goat's foot became exactly like its fellow foot which was that of a man. And immediately she understood that mighty Power that had seized her great fear and trembling came upon her, but she [straightway] rejoiced and stepped further into the water, and at length she came into the presence of King <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>. And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> welcomed her with gladness, and brought her up on his throne, and paid her honour, and permitted her to sit by his side. And the Queen informed him that she had come from the ends of the earth solely to worship in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> and to hear his wisdom. Then she asked him questions, saying, "When I came to thy honourable



<A NAME="page_li"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. li</FONT></A>

kingdom and dipped my foot in to the water, that foot being the foot of a goat, my foot touched something that was submerged in the water, whereupon it became straightway like its fellow foot. Thereupon great fear and trembling came upon me, and then joy, because of that which had happened unto me through the compassion of the Governor of the Universe". And then she showed him both her feet. Then <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> praised and glorified God, Who alone worketh mighty and wonderful things, and he testified to her that he had only made the water in order to cause her to lift her cloak so that he might see her foot, that is to say, the goat's foot. Then straightway he commanded that the water be made to go back to its place, and the courtyard became visible, and the piece of wood which she had touched with her foot stood out clearly. And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> related to her the story of the piece of wood. And when the Queen understood the matter truly she commanded that honour should be paid to the wood, and she decorated it with a collar of silver, and when <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> saw her do this he also decorated the piece of wood with another collar of silver and assigned unto it a place in the Temple, in the Temple of the Lord. And it came to pass that each and every one of <SMALL>SOLOMON'S</SMALL> successors, who came to the Temple of God to pray, as soon as they heard the story of the piece of wood decorated it with silver rings. And from the days of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> to the coming of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> this piece of wood was decorated with thirty collars of silver.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it came to pass that, when the Lord, praise be unto Him! wished to complete His Dispensation, and to effect the deliverance of <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL> and his posterity from out of the hand of the accursed Enemy&#8212;whom may God put to everlasting shame&#8212;<SMALL>JUDAS</SMALL> made a covenant with the high priests and with the cunning folk among the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> to deliver <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> unto them, so that they might be able to condemn Him to death. And the high



<A NAME="page_lii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lii</FONT></A>

priests undertook to give <SMALL>JUDAS</SMALL> the afore-mentioned collars of silver on the wood, and they sent and had the piece of wood brought by night to the place where the high priests were, and they stripped off from it the afore-mentioned collars of silver, and delivered them over to <SMALL>JUDAS</SMALL>. And <SMALL>JUDAS</SMALL> took them and delivered the <SMALL>LORD CHRIST</SMALL> over to them, even as the Gospel saith. And when the morning of the fifth day of the week had come, on which they condemned the <SMALL>LORD CHRIST</SMALL> to death on the cross, they took the piece of wood afore-mentioned, and they commanded a carpenter to make a cross out of it, and they crucified the Redeemer upon it. And this is a clear proof, even as the Tongue of gold (i.e. <SMALL>CHRYSOSTOM</SMALL>) said that our father <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL> was led astray when he ate of the fruit of the tree in Paradise, and it was because of this that he was stripped of his glory and driven out from Paradise, and Satan reigned over him and over his race. And <SMALL>ADAM'S</SMALL> deliverance also took place by the Dispensation of God through the coming of this piece of wood from the region of Paradise. And it became an honoured thing to kings, and at length the King of Kings came and was crucified upon it. And He redeemed <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL> and his descendants from the hand of the Accursed One by means of a piece of wood, even as the fruit of a piece of wood had led him into error. And concerning this, <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> the Prophet said in the Psalm,<A NAME="page_lii_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_lii_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> "Declare ye among the nations that God reigneth from the wood". And this piece of wood became most honourable because the Body of our Lord was raised up on it, and at length when they laid it upon a dead body that body rose up again. And the similitude [of the Cross] became a protection to kings and a strengthening of the remainder of the Christians for evermore. And as for the thirty collars of silver aforementioned <SMALL>JUDAS</SMALL> cast them, back to the accursed

<SMALL>JEWS</SMALL>, and after this he hanged himself and departed this life by reason of his love of money. And the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> took them and bought with them the field of the potter, and it is a place of burial for strangers unto this day. This is what happened through the piece of wood.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now we will return to the subject with which we began, namely, how the kingdom of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> was removed to the country of <SMALL>ABYSSINIA</SMALL>, and will relate the conclusion of the story. Behold, <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> the King paid honour to the Queen, and he made her and her retinue and her soldiers to alight by the side of his palace, and every day she visited him in order to hear his wisdom. And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> loved women passionately, and it came to pass that, when her visits to him multiplied, he longed for her greatly and entreated her to yield herself to him. But she would not surrender herself to him, and she said unto him, "I came to thee a maiden, a virgin; shall I go back despoiled of my virginity, and suffer disgrace in my kingdom?" And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> said unto her, "I will only take thee to myself in lawful marriage&#8212;I am the King, and thou shalt be the Queen." And she answered him never a word. And he said unto her. "Strike a covenant with me that I am only to take thee to wife of thine own free will&#8212;this shall be the condition between us: when thou shalt come to me by night as I am lying on the cushions of my bed, thou shalt become my wife by the Law of Kings." And behold she struck this covenant with him determining within herself that she would preserve her virginity from him; and this [happened] through the dispensation of God, the Most High, to Whom be praise! And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> by his wisdom instructed her for a number of days, and he did not again demand from her the surrender of her person, and the matter was good in her sight, because she thought that he had driven her out of his mind.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after these things <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> summoned the



<A NAME="page_liv"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. liv</FONT></A>

cooks and commanded them to prepare and cook food for all those who were in the palace, for himself and for the Queen, dainty and highly seasoned dishes, and he gave them pungent and aromatic and strong-smelling herbs and spices for this purpose, and the cooks did even as he had commanded them. Now when the Queen had eaten of these meats that were filled with spice and pepper and pungent herbs, she craved for cold water which she drank in large quantities by day and by night, but this did not help her to [quench her thirst]. And when the third night had come <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> secretly gave the order to all those who were about the palace, both those who were inside it and those who were outside it, that none of them was to leave with the afore-mentioned Queen the smallest quantity of water to drink, and [he swore] that any one of them who showed her where water was or gave her any of the water which was his own should be put to death forthwith and without trial. And he commanded that, if any of them were to be asked for water by her during the night, they were to say unto her, "Thou wilt find no water except by the couch of the king." And it came to pass that when the night had come, a great and fiery heat rose up in the heart of the Queen because of the highly spiced food [that she had eaten], and she sought for water to drink, but found none, and she was sorely agitated and was smitten with death. Then she cried out with a loud voice to her servants, but they were unable to find any water to give her to drink. Then by reason of the consuming thirst that had seized upon her, she wandered into the palace and went round about to every one who had water therein to find some water to drink, and every person whom she asked said unto her, "Verily, by thy kingdom, thou wilt only find water to quench the flame of thy thirst by the bedside of the King." Then the Queen went back to her couch, but she could not control herself and keep still, and her spirit



<A NAME="page_lv"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lv</FONT></A>

was about to depart from her body, and she was swooning. Then she made haste and went to the place where <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> was, so that she might drink some water there. Now <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> was in truth wide-awake, nevertheless he pretended to be asleep, and the Queen drank a very large quantity of water and assuaged her thirst, and she recovered her spirit, and she felt that her strength was restored after having [nearly] died. And when the Queen wanted to return to her couch, King <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> started up hurriedly, and seized her, and said unto her, "Verily thou hast now become my wife according to the Law of Kings." And she remembered the covenant that existed between him and her. And she gave herself into his embrace willingly and yielded to his desire, according to that which she had covenanted with him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it came to pass that after these things she became with child by him, and she said unto him, "I am going to return to my country and to my kingdom, and what shall I do with thy child if it be that God shall desire to give him life?" And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> said unto her, "If God doth will this thing and thou dost bear to me a man child, so soon as he hath reached man's estate send him to me, and I will make him king, and thy kingdom shall be his; but if thou dost bear a woman child let her stay with thee." And the Queen said unto him, "If I send thee thy son how wilt thou be certain that he is thy son?" And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> gave her his ring, and said unto her, "Guard carefully this ring, and covenant with me that thou wilt not in the smallest degree break the conditions of the true and righteous covenant that existeth between us, and God, the Governor of the Universe, the God of Abraham, and <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL>, and Jacob, the God of my father <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, shall be the witness between me and between thee. And when thou dost send my son to me, give him my ring, and let him wear it on his own hand, and I shall know that in very truth he is my son, and I will make him king



<A NAME="page_lvi"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lvi</FONT></A>

and send him back to thee." And she accepted from <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> this just covenant, and he and the Queen took farewell of each other, and she set out with her retinue to go to her own country, surrounded by the peace of God.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behold, on her arrival in her own country the Queen fulfilled the number of her days, and she brought forth a man child, and she rejoiced with an exceedingly great joy, and she called him <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, according to the name of his grandfather, and she had him reared in great state and splendour. And when he had arrived at manhood's estate, he was hale, and strong, and wise, and understanding like his father. And it fell out on a day that he spake unto his mother and said unto her, "O my mother, who is my father? Did he, peradventure, die during my childhood?" Then the Queen answered and said unto him, "My son, thy father is alive, and he is <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, the son of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, the Prophet of God and King of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, and his Kingdom is in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>. And behold, the seal of the kingdom of thy father is in my possession, and it is laid up ready for thee so that thou mayest become thereby king over the country of <SMALL>ABYSSINIA</SMALL>. And this is God's Will, and it is not due to me; the kingdom is no longer mine but thine, and thou, the King's son, art King." And this pleased the young man greatly, and he gave thanks to the Queen. And the Queen said unto him, "O my darling son, gather together for thy use gifts and soldiers, and get thee to <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> that thou mayest pray there, and see thy father and his kingdom, [and hear] his great wisdom, and that he may make thee king according to the covenant that existeth between him and me, the Governor of the Universe being witness between us." And thus saying, straightway she put his father's ring on his right hand. And by the Will of God&#8212;praise be unto Him!&#8212;he gathered together soldiers, and with them and the royal gifts he set out on



<A NAME="page_lvii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lvii</FONT></A>

his journey, and in due course he arrived in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>. And when <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> knew that a king was coming to him he commanded soldiers to meet him. And when the young man arrived at the gate of the palace of his father <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, the king was not certain that he was his son. And behold, when the young man came closer and saw the riding beast of his father standing there with his saddle on his back and his bridle in his mouth, straightway he leaped up and mounted him and pranced about, and unsheathed his sword with his hand. And when <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> saw this the matter was grievous to him, but he hid his displeasure. And when they met [later] <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> spoke openly what he had in his mind about the matter of the riding beast, and how the young man had mounted him and snatched the sword with his hand. And the young man said unto him, "The owner of this ring made me king of his kingdom when I was in my mother's womb, and this hath happened by the Will of God." And when <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> had looked at the ring, and was certain about the matters connected with it, he was overcome with joy, and he stood up by his throne and threw his arms round the young man's neck, and he cried out, saying, "Welcome, my darling boy, [thou] son of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>." And straightway he put the crown of his father <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> on his head, and made him to sit upon the throne of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> his father, and the trumpeters sounded their horns, and the proclaimers of tidings cried out, saying, "This is <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, the son of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, the son of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, the King of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>." And the matter was noised abroad, and the rumour spread about among all the tribes of the children of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> that the son of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, the son of the Queen of the South, had come to his father <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, and that <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> had made him ruler over the kingdom of his father <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, and had crowned him king, and had seated him upon his throne.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the House of the Lord which <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> had



<A NAME="page_lviii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lviii</FONT></A>

built and consecrated was the Tabernacle of the Covenant of God, and inside it were the two Tablets of stone that had been written by the Finger of God, and the rod of <SMALL>AARON</SMALL>, and the pot (or, chest) of manna. And this Tabernacle was covered with plates of gold and was draped with draperies of cloth woven with gold. And [in connection with the Tabernacle] a miracle which was seen by all the people of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> was wrought. Whensoever the priests prayed, and the supplications of themselves [and of the people] were presented before the Governor of the Universe, and they had made an end of their prostrations, the Tabernacle of the Covenant of God used to raise itself up from off the ground, and they [and the people] knew that in very truth their supplications had been accepted. And when they had made an end of their prostrations and the Tabernacle did not raise itself from off the ground, the priests knew of a certainty that some sin had been committed by themselves or by the people. Then they continued to make their supplications unto the Lord, and at the same time they searched out him that had done wrong, and they punished the guilty one, and when the Tabernacle raised itself up from off the ground they knew that God had removed His displeasure from them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it came to pass that the afore-mentioned king, the son of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, went into the House of the Lord to pray, and he saw the Tabernacle of the Covenant of God raising itself up&#8212;a matter which it is impossible for the human mind to understand&#8212;and this was pleasing in his sight, and he determined to carry off the Tabernacle of the Covenant of God to his own country. And he broke the matter to his begetter <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, the King of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, and he said unto him, "I am going to carry off the Tabernacle of the Covenant of God to my country." And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> said unto him, "O my darling son, thou canst not do this. Behold, there is no one



<A NAME="page_lix"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lix</FONT></A>

except a priest who can carry the Tabernacle, and whosoever toucheth the Tabernacle except the priests, his soul departeth from him immediately. Moreover the children of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> have no protection whatsoever against their enemies except the Tabernacle of the Covenant of God." But these words did not satisfy him, and he said unto <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, "I ask of thee neither gold nor silver, for in my country men gather in heaps gold from its earth. I ask from thee nothing but the Tabernacle of the Covenant of God, so that it may protect me on my journey, and may be a support for my kingdom and for my soldiers in my country." And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> said unto his son, "O my son, if it be the Will of God, the Governor of the Universe, that thou shalt take away the Tabernacle with thee, it will be an easy thing for thee to do so. But when thou carriest away the Tabernacle do not let me know about it, and when thou goest away with it do not bid me farewell. For, behold, without doubt, the priests and the elders of the fortress of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> will make me to swear an oath by the Name of God concerning this matter, and when I have to swear an oath by the Name of God I must swear what is true."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the young man summoned to himself secretly a workman, who made a wooden case of the same length and breadth and depth and shape as the Tabernacle, and then the young man killed him by night. Then he brought in other artificers, and they overlaid the wooden case with plates of gold similar to those that covered the Tabernacle, and he treated those men even as he had treated the carpenter, and then the young man covered the case with draperies into which gold had been woven. Now whilst he was making his preparations for his departure <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> the King knew nothing whatsoever about them. Then the young man summoned to him four of the priests who could be trusted, and he made them believe that he had done so



<A NAME="page_lx"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lx</FONT></A>

in order to ask them to pray for him before his departure, and he gave them much gold to pray for him, and he bribed them to assist him whensoever he needed them. And when the night of his departure had arrived, these priests came to him in order to bid him farewell, and he took them into his own apartment, so that they might pray for him. And when they had entered and were in the apartment with him, he bound them in iron fetters for the night, and commanded his soldiers to mount and depart without sounding the trumpets. Then he took with him a company of his servants who were carrying spears in their hands, and he took those priests whom he had bound with iron fetters for the night so that they might not escape, and he went into the House of God. And he commanded the priests who were with him to carry away the Tabernacle of the Covenant of God, and then he deposited the case which he had had made to resemble it in the place thereof. And he went forth by night having with him the Tabernacle, which was carried by the priests, and he neither bade his father farewell nor allowed him to know of his departure. And this happened by the Dispensation of God the Most High, praise be unto Him! for the protection of the holy Tabernacle of His Covenant, so that it might abide for ever even as the Davidic kingdom, for even so did God make the promise to <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> that the offspring of his loins should sit upon his throne for ever. And in this manner, enveloped in the protection of God, did the young man set out on his journey.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it came to pass that, when the morning had come, the children of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> and the priests went into the House of God according to their wont to pray. And it came to pass that, when the priests had made an end of their prostrations and had presented their supplications unto the Governor of the Universe, the Tabernacle did not rise up into the air, and it did not



<A NAME="page_lxi"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxi</FONT></A>

stir from its place. And they said, "Behold, some folk have sinned"; and they ordered fasting and prayer for three days, and they searched among the people to find out who had committed sin and folly, but they found no [guilty] person. And after this the priests went up to the Tabernacle, and O what calamity, and terror, and grief were there for them when they did not find the Tabernacle of the Covenant of God and its holy things, but only an empty case resting upon the place where the Tabernacle had stood! Then they knew that of a certainty the son of King <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> had taken it away. And they searched and made an examination into the number of the priests who were among the tribes of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, but they were not able to find those priests whom the young man had taken with him, and thus it became clear to them that the sin lay with them (i.e. the four priests).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behold, the priests and the elders of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> went to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> the King, and they were weeping and sorrowing because of the absence of the Tabernacle of the Covenant of God from its Holy Shrine, and they said unto <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, "It is thou who hast commanded thy son to take the Tabernacle." And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> wept and cried out in pain, and displayed exceedingly great sorrow, and he swore an oath to them, saying that he had not given his son permission to do this thing, and that he had not bidden him farewell, and that he knew nothing whatsoever about his departure or when it took place. And the priests and elders answered, saying, "May the King live! If this thing hath taken place without thy wish and without thy permission, despatch thou with us armed soldiers that we may pursue him and take from him the holy Tabernacle of the Covenant of God, so that we may bring it back to His sacred House." And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> gave them soldiers, and money, and provisions, and they set out in quest of the young man, and they rode on their way continuously



<A NAME="page_lxii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxii</FONT></A>

for forty days. And they found merchants riding towards them on their return journey, and they enquired of them concerning the Tabernacle, and whether they had seen it. And the merchants answered them, saying, "We have seen a great king and his numerous soldiers, and the Box of the Covenant of God was with them. And they were travelling along like the clouds when they are driven before the attack of mighty winds for a very long distance at a time, and the natives of the villages through which we have passed informed us that they travelled each day the distance of a forty days' journey." And they returned defeated and disheartened, and weeping and regretting; but regret in no way helped them. And behold, the young man arrived in his country safe and sound, and his mother met him, and she abdicated in his favour, and he rose up as king on the throne of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> his father, and the kingdom of <SMALL>ABYSSINIA</SMALL> belonged to the throne of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> for ever and ever, and the Tabernacle of the Covenant of God remained therein.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what happened in respect of the Tabernacle of the Lord, and this is the reason why it was transferred to the country of the <SMALL>N&#276;G&Ucirc;S</SMALL>; and this state of affairs continued until the birth of our Lord <SMALL>JESUS CHRIST</SMALL> of the pure <SMALL>MARY</SMALL>. And He completed His Dispensation upon earth and set free <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL> and his posterity. And after His Ascension into heaven the Disciples preached the Gospel in His Name in all the earth. And concerning the story of the eunuch, the Deputy of <SMALL>&#7730;AND&Acirc;&#7730;ES</SMALL>, it is related that the cause of his visit to <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> was to pray [there]. And on his return journey the Holy Spirit sent to him the Apostle <SMALL>PHILIP</SMALL>, and the eunuch believed and was baptized; and when he went back to his native land he preached <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> therein, and all the people believed through him. And after this <SMALL>P&Acirc;RMEN&Acirc;S</SMALL>, one of the Seven, went to them, and he baptized them, and consecrated for them priests and deacons, and he



<A NAME="page_lxiii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxiii</FONT></A>

ordained that their Father should be of the throne of <SMALL>MARK</SMALL> the Evangelist. And the orthodox Faith was established in the country of <SMALL>ABYSSINIA</SMALL>, and the sovereignty of [the house of] <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> remained fixed therein for ever and ever. Glory, and praise, and majesty, and honour, and supplication be unto the Holy Trinity for ever and ever! Amen. This is what is found [written] in the Histories of the ancient Fathers of the Coptic Church. Praise be unto the Giver of understanding and wisdom to His creatures; may His mercy be upon us for ever!</P>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author, or editor, of the <SMALL>&#7730;UR&#8217;&Acirc;N</SMALL> devoted a considerable section of Surah XXVII to the correspondence that passed between the Queen of <SMALL>SHEBA</SMALL> and King <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, and to their interviews. Among the many gifts that God bestowed upon <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> were the understanding of the speech of birds, and knowledge of every kind. He was the lord of men, genii and birds. When he travelled through the air on his magical carpet of green silk, which was borne aloft by the wind according to the King's direction, the men stood on the right of it, and the spirits on the left, and a vast army of birds of every kind kept flying over the carpet to protect its occupants from the heat of the sun. One day when he was reviewing the birds he perceived that the lapwing was absent, and he asked why she was absent, and threatened to punish her for not making her appearance with the other birds. Very soon after he had spoken the lapwing appeared, and she excused herself for her absence by saying that she had been looking upon a country that the king had never seen, and that she had seen <SMALL>S&Acirc;BA</SMALL>, which was ruled over by a queen called "<SMALL>BAL&#7730;&Icirc;S</SMALL>", who was very rich, and who sat upon a throne made of gold and silver and set with precious stones,



<A NAME="page_lxiv"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxiv</FONT></A>

eighty cubits long, forty cubits broad, and thirty cubits high. The queen and her people were idolaters and worshipped the sun, and they were under the influence of <SMALL>SATAN</SMALL>, who had turned them from the right way. Thereupon <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> wrote the following letter to the Queen of <SMALL>SHEBA</SMALL>: "From the servant of God, <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, the son of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, unto <SMALL>BAL&#7730;&Icirc;S</SMALL> (###) Queen of <SMALL>SHEBA</SMALL>. In the Name of the most merciful God. Peace be unto him who followeth the true direction. Rise not up against me, but come and render yourselves unto me." Having perfumed this letter with musk and sealed it with his wonderful seal, <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> gave it to the lapwing and told the bird to go and drop it in <SMALL>S&Acirc;BA</SMALL>, and to turn aside afterwards and wait for the Queen's answer. The lapwing departed and delivered the letter, some saying that she flew into the Queen's private apartment through the window, and others that she dropped the letter into the Queen's bosom<A NAME="page_lxiv_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_lxiv_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> as she was standing surrounded by her army. Having read the letter the Queen called upon her nobles to advise her what to do, but they reminded her that they were soldiers, who were ready to march against <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> if she ordered them to do so, and that the letter was addressed to her and she must make the decision. Wishing to avoid invasion and the evils that would follow in its train, the Queen decided to send gifts to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, and she despatched forthwith five hundred male and five hundred female slaves, five hundred ingots of gold, a crown studded with precious stones, and a large quantity of musk, amber, spices, precious woods, etc. The lapwing returned quickly to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> and told him what had happened, and that an embassy from the Queen bearing gifts was on its way. When the men of <SMALL>S&Acirc;BA</SMALL> arrived they were received by <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> in a large square surrounded by a wall, the



<A NAME="page_lxv"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxv</FONT></A>

bricks of which were made of gold and silver. <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> spoke slightingly of the Queen's gifts and sent the embassy back, bidding them tell their mistress that he would send invincible troops against her city, and that they would capture it and expel its inhabitants in disgrace. When <SMALL>BAL&#7730;&Icirc;S</SMALL> received this message, she determined to go to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> and to tender her submission to him, and having locked up her throne in a certain strong fortress, and set a guard over it to protect it, she set out for <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, accompanied by a large army. Whilst she was on her way <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> said one day to his nobles, "Which of you will bring the Queen's throne here to me before she and her company arrive?" And an <SMALL>&#8219;IFR&Icirc;T</SMALL>, one of the genii, whose aspect was most terrible, and who was called <SMALL>DHAKW&Acirc;N</SMALL> ### or <SMALL>&#7778;AKHR</SMALL>, ### , said, "I will bring it to thee before thou hast finished thy session. Now <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> used to sit in judgment until noon daily.<A NAME="page_lxv_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_lxv_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> Some one who had knowledge of books and who was present seemed to think that the <SMALL>&#8219;IFR&Icirc;T</SMALL> was demanding too much time in which to fulfil the King's urgent wish, and he said, I will bring thee the throne before thou canst cast thine eyes on an object and remove them again." The commentators are in doubt about the identity of the person who made this offer to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, for some say he was <SMALL>&Acirc;&#7778;AF</SMALL>, the son of <SMALL>BARKH&Icirc;Y&Acirc;</SMALL>, the waz&icirc;r of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, and others that he was <SMALL>KHIDHR</SMALL> (<SMALL>ELIJAH</SMALL>), or <SMALL>GABRIEL</SMALL>, or some other angel, or even <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> himself.<A NAME="page_lxv_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_lxv_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> It is generally thought that the person was <SMALL>&Acirc;&#7778;AF</SMALL>, for he knew the ineffable Name of God. Be this as it may, <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> accepted the offer, and raising his eyes to heaven brought them down quickly to earth again, and when his eyes rested on the earth he saw the throne of <SMALL>BAL&#7730;&Icirc;S</SMALL> standing before him. Then <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> had the throne altered, with the view of preventing her knowing her own throne when she



<A NAME="page_lxvi"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxvi</FONT></A>

arrived. When <SMALL>BAL&#7730;&Icirc;S</SMALL> came into his presence, he pointed to the throne, saying, "Is thy throne like unto this?" And she replied, "It is all one with this." Then <SMALL>BAL&#7730;&Icirc;S</SMALL> was invited to go into the palace which <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> had built specially for her reception. The walls were made of blocks of white glass, and the floor was made also of glass, over which water flowed, and in the running water fishes swam. When <SMALL>BAL&#7730;&Icirc;S</SMALL> turned to enter the palace and saw the water, thinking that it was deep, she drew up the skirts of her garments before attempting to walk through it. By this act she uncovered her legs, and <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> had proof that the rumour that the feet and legs of <SMALL>BAL&#7730;&Icirc;S</SMALL> were covered with hair like the coat of an ass, was true. The sight of the glass building with its floor of glass amazed <SMALL>BAL&#7730;&Icirc;S</SMALL>, who said, "O Lord, verily I have dealt unjustly with my own soul, and I resign myself, together with <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, unto God, the Lord of all creatures." Some commentators think that the Queen uttered these words partly in repentance for having worshipped the sun, and partly through fear of being drowned in the water which she saw before her. <SMALL>JAL&Acirc;L AD-D&Icirc;N</SMALL> says that <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> thought of marrying <SMALL>BAL&#7730;&Icirc;S</SMALL>, but could not bring himself to do so because of the hair on her feet and legs. The devils who were always in attendance on <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> removed the hair by the use of some infernal depilatory,<A NAME="page_lxvi_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_lxvi_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> but it is doubtful if even then <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> married her. <SMALL>AL-BEIDHAW&Icirc;</SMALL> says that it is very doubtful who married <SMALL>BAL&#7730;&Icirc;S</SMALL>, but is inclined to think that it was one of the chiefs of the Hamd&acirc;n tribe.<A NAME="page_lxvi_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_lxvi_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A curious and interesting legend of the way in which King <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> became the father of <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> is found in a number of slightly varying versions among many of



<A NAME="page_lxvii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxvii</FONT></A>

the tribes of Northern <SMALL>ABYSSINIA</SMALL>.<A NAME="page_lxvii_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_lxvii_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> According to this the mother of <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> was a Tigr&ecirc; girl called <SMALL>&#276;T&#276;Y&Ecirc; AZ&Ecirc;B</SMALL> (i.e. Queen of the South), and her people worshipped a dragon or serpent, to which each man in turn had to present as an offering his eldest daughter, and large quantities of sweet beer and milk. When the turn of her parents came they tied her to a tree where the dragon used to come for his food, and soon after this seven saints came and seated themselves under the tree for the sake of the shade it gave. As they sat a tear dropped from the maiden above them, and when they looked up and saw her bound to the tree they asked her if she was a human being or a spirit, and she told them that she was a human being and, in answer to a further question, she told them that she was bound to the tree so that she might become food for the dragon. When the seven saints saw the dragon, one of them, Abb&acirc; <SMALL>TCH&Ecirc;&#7716;AM&Acirc;</SMALL>, plucked at his own beard, another, Abb&acirc; <SMALL>GAR&Icirc;M&Acirc;</SMALL> exclaimed "He hath frightened me", and a third, Abb&acirc; <SMALL>MEN&#7788;EL&Icirc;T</SMALL>, cried out, "Let us seize him"; and he forthwith attacked the monster, and aided by his companions they killed him by smiting him with a cross. As they were killing him some blood spurted out from him and fell on the heel of <SMALL>&#276;T&#276;Y&Ecirc; AZ&Ecirc;B</SMALL>, and from that moment her heel became like the heel of an ass. The saints untied her fetters and sent her to her village, but the people drove her away, thinking that she had escaped from the dragon, and she climbed up into a tree and passed the night there. On the following day she fetched some people from the village and showed them the dead dragon, and they straightway made her their chieftainess, and she chose for her chief officer a maiden like herself. Soon after this <SMALL>&#276;T&#276;Y&Ecirc; AZ&Ecirc;B</SMALL> heard a report of the medical skill of King <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, and she determined



<A NAME="page_lxviii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxviii</FONT></A>

to go to him so that he might restore her deformed heel to its original shape. She and her chief officer dressed their hair after the manner of men, and girded on swords, and departed to the Court of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> at <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>. Her arrival was announced to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, who ordered his servants to bring the King of <SMALL>ABYSSINIA</SMALL> into his presence, and as soon as her deformed foot touched the threshold it recovered its natural form. <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> had bread, meat, and beer brought in and set before the two women who were disguised as men, but they ate and drank so little that <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> suspected that his guests were women. When night fell he caused two beds to be made for his guests in his own bedroom, and he hung up in the room a skin with honey[comb] in it, and he pierced the skin and the honey dropped down into a bowl set there to catch it, and <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> and his guests betook themselves to their beds. At night the king was accustomed to keep vigil with his eyes closed, and to sleep with them half-open, and thus when the two women, who were longing to get off their beds and to go and drink honey from the bowl, saw him with his eyes half-open they thought that the king was awake, and they curbed their desire for the honey and lay still. After a time the king woke up and closed his eyes, but the women, thinking he was asleep, rose from their beds and went to the bowl of honey and began to eat. By this <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> knew that his two guests were women, and he got up and went with them to their beds and lay with both of them. When he left them he gave to each woman a silver staff and a ring, and he said, "If the child be a girl let her take this staff and come to me, and if it be a boy let him take the ring and come to me"; and each woman being with child returned to her own country. In due course each woman gave birth to a son, and each told her child that <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> was his father. When the boys grew up their mothers sent them to <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, and the Queen of <SMALL>SHEBA</SMALL> gave her son, who



<A NAME="page_lxix"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxix</FONT></A>

resembled <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> in every way, a mirror which she had brought when she visited <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, and told him to go with it to the king, who would hide from him, and not to speak to any other man who might be sitting on his throne. When the two youths arrived in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> and <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> knew that they claimed to be his sons, he gave orders for them to wait for an interview, and kept them waiting for three years. At the close of the third year he arrayed a friend in his royal robes, and seated him upon his throne, whilst he dressed himself in rags and went and sat in a stable, and then ordered the two young men to be admitted to the presence. When the young men entered the throne room the son of the Queen of <SMALL>SHEBA'S</SMALL> minister grasped the hand of the man on the throne, who personified <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, thinking that he was the king, but the son of the Queen of <SMALL>SHEBA</SMALL>, who was called "<SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL>", stood upright and made no obeisance, and when he looked in the mirror which his mother had given him, and saw that the features of the occupant of the throne were entirely different from his own, he knew that he was not standing in the presence of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>. Then he turned about in all directions and looked at all the faces that were round about him, and found none resembling his own; after a time he looked up and saw <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> gazing at him from the stable, and he knew him at once, and went to the stable and did homage to him as king. And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> said, "My true son! The other is also my son, but he is a fool." <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> then took up his abode in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> and assisted <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> in ruling the kingdom, but after a time the people found that father and son did not always agree in their judicial decisions, and they became dissatisfied. On one occasion in the case of a trespass of cattle the king decided that the owner of the field might confiscate the cattle which had trespassed, but <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> ordered him to accept six measures of grain instead of confiscating the cattle.



<A NAME="page_lxx"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxx</FONT></A>

Thereupon the people told the king that they would not be ruled by two chiefs, and that he must send his son back to his native country. When <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> told his son of the people's complaint <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> advised his father to say to them, "Is not <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> my first-born son? I will send him away if you will send your first-born sons with him"; and the people agreed to send their first-born sons to <SMALL>ABYSSINIA</SMALL> with <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL>. When <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> was arranging for <SMALL>MENYELEK'S</SMALL> departure he told him to take the Ark of <SMALL>MICHAEL</SMALL> with him, but <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL>, believing the Ark of <SMALL>MARY</SMALL> to be of greater importance, changed the covers of the two Arks, and took with him the Ark of <SMALL>MARY</SMALL>. A few days after the departure of <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> a storm visited <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, and <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> told his servants to find out if the Ark of <SMALL>MARY</SMALL> was in its place, presumably with the idea of securing its protection against the storm. His servants went and looked and, seeing an Ark with the cover of <SMALL>MARY'S</SMALL> Ark upon it, assumed that it was the Ark of <SMALL>MARY</SMALL>, and reported to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> that the Ark of <SMALL>MARY</SMALL> was in its place. He then told them to take off the cover, and when they had done so they found that the Ark was <SMALL>MICHAEL'S</SMALL>, and though <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> sent a messenger after <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> to bring back the Ark of <SMALL>MARY</SMALL>, his son refused to give it up. Meanwhile <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> and his party went on their way, and when they arrived at <SMALL>&#7730;AY&#276;&#7716; K&Ocirc;R</SMALL>, a deacon who was carrying the Ark of <SMALL>MARY</SMALL> died, and was buried there. After the burial they wished to resume their journey, but the Ark of <SMALL>MARY</SMALL> refused to move. They then dug up the deacon's body, and laid it in a coffin, and buried it again, but still the Ark refused to move, and when <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> again ordered them to dig up the body, they found a finger of the deacon outside the coffin. When they had placed the deacon's finger in the coffin with the rest of his body, the Ark of <SMALL>MARY</SMALL> allowed itself to be moved, and <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> and his companions went on their way. In due course they came to <SMALL>TEGR&Acirc;Y</SMALL> and



<A NAME="page_lxxi"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxi</FONT></A>

arrived in <SMALL>AKS&Ucirc;M</SMALL>, where they found <SMALL>SATAN</SMALL> building a house to fight against God. When they told him that the Ark of <SMALL>MARY</SMALL> had come he stopped building, threw down what he had built, and went away; and the stones which he had collected were used by <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> in building a church to hold the Ark of <SMALL>MARY</SMALL>. One very large stone, which <SMALL>SATAN</SMALL> was carrying to his building when the news came of the arrival of the Ark of <SMALL>MARY</SMALL>, was dropped by him at once, and at the present day that stone stands on the same spot on which he dropped it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book opens with an interpretation and explanation of the Three Hundred and Eighteen Orthodox Fathers concerning the children of <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL>, and the statement that the Trinity lived in <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, the Tabernacle of the Law of God, which God made in the fortress of His holiness before He made anything else. The Trinity agreed to make man in God's image, and the Son agreed to put on the flesh of <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL>; man was made to take the place of <SMALL>SATAN</SMALL> and to praise God. In due course <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>, the second <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL>, was born of the flesh of <SMALL>MARY</SMALL> the Virgin, the Second <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> (Chap. 1).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Chap. 2 <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL>, the translator of the Ethiopic text, next quotes <SMALL>GREGORY</SMALL> the Illuminator, the son of <SMALL>ANAG</SMALL>, a native of <SMALL>BALKH</SMALL>, who was born about 257 <SMALL>A.D.</SMALL> and died about 330. Whilst <SMALL>GREGORY</SMALL> was suffering the tortures inflicted upon him by <SMALL>TIRIDATES III</SMALL> he pondered on the question, Of what doth the glory of kings consist? In the end he came to the conclusion that <SMALL>ADAM'S</SMALL> kingship bestowed upon him by God was greater than that of any of the Kings of <SMALL>ARMENIA</SMALL>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaps. 3-6 deal with the birth of <SMALL>CAIN</SMALL> and <SMALL>ABEL</SMALL>; the face of <SMALL>CAIN</SMALL> was sullen and that of <SMALL>ABEL</SMALL> good tempered, and <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL> made <SMALL>ABEL</SMALL> his heir because of his pleasing countenance. <SMALL>CAIN</SMALL> and <SMALL>ABEL</SMALL> had twin sisters. <SMALL>CAIN'S</SMALL>



<A NAME="page_lxxii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxii</FONT></A>

sister <SMALL>L&#276;BH&Ucirc;DH&Acirc;</SMALL> had a good- tempered face, and <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL> gave her in marriage to <SMALL>ABEL</SMALL>; <SMALL>ABEL'S</SMALL> sister <SMALL>&#7730;AL&Icirc;MATH</SMALL> had a sullen face like <SMALL>CAIN</SMALL>, and <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL> gave her in marriage to <SMALL>CAIN</SMALL>.<A NAME="page_lxxii_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_lxxii_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> Moved by <SMALL>SATAN</SMALL> to envy, and filled with wrath against <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL> for taking his twin sister from him, <SMALL>CAIN</SMALL> rose up and slew <SMALL>ABEL</SMALL>. <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL> was consoled for <SMALL>ABEL'S</SMALL> death by the birth of Seth. The descendants of <SMALL>CAIN</SMALL> were wicked men, and neglected God, and passed their time in singing lewd songs to stringed instruments and pipes and they lived lawless and abominable lives. <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL> credits them with having produced the mule, and condemns the crossing of mares with asses. In the tenth generation from <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL> <SMALL>NOAH</SMALL> lived, and he refused to deal in any way with the children of <SMALL>CAIN</SMALL>, whose arrogance, pride, fraud, deceit, and uncleanness cried aloud to heaven. At length God sent the Flood, which destroyed everything on the earth except Eight Souls, and seven of every clean beast, and two of every unclean beast (Chap. 8). God made a covenant with <SMALL>NOAH</SMALL> not to destroy the earth again by a flood, and when <SMALL>NOAH</SMALL> died <SMALL>SHEM</SMALL> succeeded him (Chaps. 9 and 10). In Chap. 11 we have another declaration by the 318 Orthodox Fathers that: 1. The Tabernacle of the Law (i.e. the Ark of the Covenant) was created before the heavens, the earth and its pillars, the sea, and men and angels; 2. It was made by God for His own abode; 3. It is on the earth. The <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> wherein God dwelt in heaven before the creation was the type and similitude of the <SMALL>VIRGIN MARY</SMALL>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven sons of <SMALL>CANAAN</SMALL>, who were the sons of <SMALL>HAM</SMALL>, seized seven cities that belonged to <SMALL>SHEM'S</SMALL> children, but eventually had to relinquish them. The nations seized by <SMALL>CANAAN'S</SMALL> sons were the <SMALL>CANAANITES</SMALL>, the <SMALL>PERIZZITES</SMALL>, the <SMALL>HIVITES</SMALL>, the <SMALL>HITTITES</SMALL>, the <SMALL>AMORITES</SMALL>, the <SMALL>JEBUSITES</SMALL>, the <SMALL>GIRGASITES</SMALL>. In the days of <SMALL>TERAH</SMALL> men made

magical images, and placed on the tombs of their fathers statues, out of which devils spake and commanded them to offer up their sons and daughters as sacrifices to "filthy devils" (Chap. 12). <SMALL>TERAH'S</SMALL> son <SMALL>ABRAHAM</SMALL>, having proved for himself the powerlessness of idols, smashed the idols which his father sent him to sell, and then called upon the Creator of the Universe to be his God. A chariot of fire appeared (Chap. 13) and with it God, Who made a covenant with him, and told him to depart to another country. <SMALL>ABRAHAM</SMALL> took his wife, and departed to <SMALL>SALEM</SMALL>, where he reigned in righteousness according to God's command. He had a bodyguard of eighteen<A NAME="page_lxxiii_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_lxxiii_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> stalwart men who wore crowns and belts of gold, and gold-embroidered tunics.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL> and <SMALL>JACOB</SMALL> pleased God in their lives (Chap. 15), but <SMALL>REUBEN</SMALL> transgressed and the succession passed from him (Chap. 16); under the curse of <SMALL>JACOB</SMALL>, with whose concubine <SMALL>BILHAH</SMALL> <SMALL>REUBEN</SMALL> had lain, the children of <SMALL>REUBEN</SMALL> became leprous and scabby.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chap. 17 describes the glory of <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, i.e. the Tabernacle of the Law of God which God brought down from heaven to earth, and showed <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL>, and ordered him to make a copy of it. <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL> therefore made a box of acacia wood two and a half cubits long, one and a half cubits broad and one and a half cubits deep, i.e. a portable shrine measuring 3 ft. 9 in. by 2 ft. 3 in. by 2 ft. 3 in. or 4 ft. 2 in. by 2 ft. 6 in. by 2 ft. 6 in. In this shrine he placed the Two Tables of the Covenant, a gold pot containing one omer of manna, and the wonderful rod of <SMALL>AARON</SMALL>, which put forth buds when it was withered. This rod had been broken in two places and was in three pieces, and each piece became a separate and complete rod (see p. 13 and Exod. xvi. 33, 34; Hebrews ix. 2; Numbers xvii. 10). We may note that in 2 Chron. v. 10, it is said that there was nothing in the Ark except



<A NAME="page_lxxiv"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxiv</FONT></A>

the Two Tables which <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL> put therein in <SMALL>HOREB</SMALL>. <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL> covered the Ark with gold, inside and outside, and made all the vessels, hangings, &amp;c., according to the patterns given to him by God. But there was something else in the Ark made by <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL>. By God's orders he made a case, presumably of gold, in the shape of the "belly of a ship" (p. 15), and in this the Two Tables were to rest. As the <SMALL>VIRGIN MARY</SMALL> is called the "new ship who carried the wealth of the world", this "belly of a ship" was a type of her. The case for the Two Tables symbolized her womb, the case carried the Word cut on stone, and <SMALL>MARY</SMALL> carried the Living Word incarnate. And the Ark made by <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL> was the abode of God, Who dwelt with the Two Tables.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Chap 19 <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL>, the translator of the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL>, begins a long extract from an apocryphal work which "<SMALL>DOMITIUS</SMALL>, Archbishop of <SMALL>CONSTANTINOPLE</SMALL>", says he found among the manuscripts in the library of Saint <SMALL>SOPHIA</SMALL>. I have failed to identify either <SMALL>DOMITIUS</SMALL> or the work he quotes. According to this work the Emperor of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> and the Emperor of <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc;</SMALL> (i.e. <SMALL>BYZANTIUM</SMALL>) are the sons of <SMALL>SHEM</SMALL>, and they divide the world between them (Chap. 20). From the same work we have a description of <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> the "Queen of the South" (Matt. xii. 42), who was shrewd, intelligent in mind, beautiful in face and form, and exceedingly rich. She carried on a large business on land by means of caravans, and on sea by means of ships, and she traded with the merchants of <SMALL>INDIA</SMALL> and <SMALL>NUBIA</SMALL> and <SMALL>ASW&Acirc;N</SMALL> (<SMALL>SYENE</SMALL>). As the Queen came from the south her home was probably in Southern <SMALL>ARABIA</SMALL>, and she is far more likely to have been of <SMALL>ARAB</SMALL> than <SMALL>ETHIOPIAN</SMALL> origin. The head of her trading caravans was <SMALL>T&Acirc;MR&Icirc;N</SMALL>, a clever man of affairs who directed the operations of 520 camels and 73 ships (Chap. 22). At this time <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> wanted gold, ebony and sapphires for the building of the Temple of God in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, and he opened negotiations



<A NAME="page_lxxv"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxv</FONT></A>

with <SMALL>T&Acirc;MR&Icirc;N</SMALL> for the supply of the same. <SMALL>T&Acirc;MR&Icirc;N</SMALL> loaded his camels and took his goods to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, who proved to be a generous customer, and his wisdom and handsome appearance and riches greatly impressed the merchant from the South. <SMALL>T&Acirc;MR&Icirc;N</SMALL> saw with amazement that <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> was employing 700 carpenters and 800 masons on the building of the Temple (Chaps. 22, 23). When <SMALL>T&Acirc;MR&Icirc;N</SMALL> returned to his mistress he told the Queen all that he had seen at <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, and day by day he described to her <SMALL>SOLOMON'S</SMALL> power and wisdom and the magnificence of the state in which he lived. Little by little, desire to see this wonderful man and to imbibe his wisdom grew in the Queen's mind, and at length she (Chap. 24) decided to go to <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>. Thereupon 797 camels and mules and asses innumerable were loaded, and she left her kingdom, and made her way direct to <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Queen met <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> she gave him rich presents, (Chap. 25), and he established her in a lodging, and supplied her with food and servants and rich apparel. The Queen was fascinated as much by his wisdom as by his physical perfections, and she marvelled at the extent and variety of his knowledge. When she saw him instructing the mason, the carpenter, the blacksmith, and directing all the workmen, and at the same time acting as judge and ruler of his people and household, her astonishment was unbounded.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During her stay in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> conversed daily (Chaps. 26, 27) with <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, and she learned from him about the God of the Hebrews, the Creator of the heavens and the earth. She herself worshipped the sun, moon and stars, and trees, and idols of gold and silver, but under the influence of <SMALL>SOLOMON'S</SMALL> beautiful voice and eloquent words she renounced <SMALL>&#7778;&Acirc;B&Acirc;ISM</SMALL>, and worshipped not the sun but the sun's Creator, the God of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> (Chap. 28). And she vowed that her seed after her should adore the Tabernacle of the God of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>,



<A NAME="page_lxxvi"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxvi</FONT></A>

the abode of God upon earth. <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> and <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> exchanged visits frequently and the more she saw of him the more she appreciated his wisdom. The birds and the beasts also came to hear his wisdom, and <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> talked to them, each in his own language, and they went back to their native lands and told their fellow creatures what they had seen and heard.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> sent a message to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, saying that the time had arrived for her to return to her own country. When <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> heard this he pondered deeply and determined to company with her, for he loved her physical beauty and her shrewd native intelligence, and he wished to beget a son by her. <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> had 400 wives and 600 concubines,<A NAME="page_lxxvi_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_lxxvi_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> and among them were women from <SMALL>SYRIA</SMALL>, <SMALL>PALESTINE</SMALL>, the <SMALL>DELTA</SMALL>, <SMALL>UPPER EGYPT</SMALL> and <SMALL>NUBIA</SMALL>. Our translator, <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL>, excuses <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> for his excessive love of women, and says that he was not addicted to fornication, but only took these thousand women to wife that he might get sons by each of them. These children were to inherit the countries of his enemies and destroy idolaters. Moreover, <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> lived under the Law of the Flesh, for the Holy Spirit was not given to men in his time. In answer to <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;'S</SMALL> message <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> sent her an invitation to a splendid banquet, which the Queen accepted, and she went to a place which he had prepared specially for her in the great tent (Chap. 29). The courses were ten in number, and the dishes were dainty, highly seasoned, and abundant, and the Queen was satisfied with their smell only. The tent was furnished with truly Oriental magnificence, scented oils had been sprinkled about with a lavish hand, the air was heavy with the perfumes of burning myrrh and cassia, and the Queen ate and drank heartily. When all the other guests had departed and <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> and <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> were alone, the King showed her a couch and invited her to sleep



<A NAME="page_lxxvii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxvii</FONT></A>

there. <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> agreed on the condition that he did not attempt to take her by force, and in reply <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> said that he would not touch her provided that she did not attempt to take anything that was in his house. Thereupon each vowed to respect the property of the other, and the Queen lay down to sleep. After a short time the highly-spiced meats began to have their effect, and the Queen was seized with violent thirst (Chap. 30). She got up and searched for water but found none. At length she saw a vessel of water by the King's bed, and thinking that he was asleep, she went and took up the vessel and was about to drink when <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> jumped up, and stopped her, and accused her of breaking her oath not to steal anything of his. The agony of thirst was so great that the Queen retracted her oath, and <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> allowed her to drink her fill, and then she retired with him to his couch and slept there. <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> was a virgin Queen and had reigned over her country six years, when <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> took her to wife. That same night <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> saw a dream in which the sun came down from heaven, and shone brilliantly over <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, and then departed to <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> to shine there for ever. Then a Sun far more brilliant came down and shone over <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, and the <SMALL>ISRAELITES</SMALL> rejected that Sun and destroyed it, and buried it; but that Sun rose again and ascended into heaven, and paid no further heed to <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>. When <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> understood the meaning of that vision he was greatly disturbed and troubled in his mind, for he knew that the departure of the sun from <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> typified the departure of God.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> departed from <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, but before she left, <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> gave her six thousand wagonloads of beautiful things, two specially constructed vehicles, one in which to travel over the sea, and one in which to travel through the air. Thus <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> anticipated the motor boat and the airship. Besides all these things <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> gave her the ring that was on his



<A NAME="page_lxxviii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxviii</FONT></A>

little finger (Chap. 31), as a token whereby she might remember him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine months and five days after <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> bade <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> farewell she brought forth a man child, and in due course she arrived in her own country, where she was received with great joy and delight. She called her son <SMALL>BAYNA-LE&#7716;KEM</SMALL>, i.e. <SMALL>IBN AL-&#7716;AK&Icirc;M</SMALL>, "the son of the wise man", and he grew into a strong and handsome young man. At the age of twelve he questioned his mother as to his parentage, and in spite of rebuffs by her he continued to do so until she told him; ten years later no power could keep him in his own country, and <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> sent him to <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, accompanied by her old chief of caravans, <SMALL>T&Acirc;MR&Icirc;N</SMALL> (Chaps. 32, 33). With him she sent a letter to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, telling him that in future a king should reign over her country, and not a virgin queen, and that her people should adopt the religion of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>. Finally she sent salutations to the Tabernacle of the Law of God, and begged <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> to send her a portion of the fringe from the Covering of <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, so that it might be treasured by her as a holy possession for ever. In saying farewell to her son, <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> gave him the ring which <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> had given her, so that if necessary he might use it as a proof that he was the son of <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> by <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the young man arrived at <SMALL>G&Acirc;Z&Acirc;</SMALL>, a district which <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> had given to the Queen of <SMALL>SHEBA</SMALL> (Chap. 34), all the people were astonished at his close resemblance to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, and some of them went so far so to declare that he <I>was</I> <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> in person. The minds of the people were much exercised about the matter, and messengers were sent to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> from <SMALL>G&Acirc;Z&Acirc;</SMALL> announcing the arrival of a merchant who resembled him in face and features, and in form and stature, and in manners and carriage and behaviour. At that time <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> was depressed, by reason of the miscarriage of his plans in respect of obtaining a large posterity, like "the stars



<A NAME="page_lxxix"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxix</FONT></A>

of heaven and the sands on the seashore." He had married one thousand women, meaning to beget by them one thousand sons, but God only gave him three children! Therefore, when he heard of the arrival of the young merchant who resembled himself, he knew at once that it was his son by the Queen of <SMALL>SHEBA</SMALL> who had come to see him, and he sent out <SMALL>BENAIAH</SMALL>, the son of <SMALL>JEHOIADA</SMALL>, to meet him and to bring him to <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> (Chap. 35). In due course <SMALL>BENAIAH</SMALL> met <SMALL>BAYNA-LE&#7716;KEM</SMALL>, and he and his fifty guards escorted him into the presence of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, who acknowledged him straightway, and embraced him, and kissed him on his forehead and eyes and mouth (Chap. 36). He then took him into his chamber and arrayed him in gorgeous apparel, and gave him a belt of gold and a gold crown, and set a ring upon his finger, and when he presented him to the nobles of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, they accepted him as <SMALL>SOLOMON'S</SMALL> son and brought gifts to him. Then <SMALL>BAYNA-LE&#7716;KEM</SMALL> produced the ring which he had brought from his mother and gave it to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, who said that it was unnecessary, for his face and stature proclaimed that he was his son.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after this <SMALL>T&Acirc;MR&Icirc;N</SMALL> had an audience of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, and he asked him to anoint <SMALL>BAYNA-LE&#7716;KEM</SMALL> king, to consecrate and to bless him and then to send him back to his mother as soon as possible, for such was her desire. This old and faithful servant was afraid that the luxurious living of <SMALL>SOLOMON'S</SMALL> house would have an ill effect upon his future king, and he was anxious to get him away from <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> as soon as possible. To this <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> replied that after a woman had brought forth her son and suckled him she had nothing more to do with him, for a boy belongs to his father and a girl to her mother. And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> refused to give up his first-born son. But <SMALL>BAYNA-LE&#7716;KEM</SMALL> himself was anxious to leave <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> (Chap. 36), and he begged <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> to give him a portion of the fringe of the Tabernacle of the Law of God, and to let him depart. He had no wish to live

as <SMALL>SOLOMON'S</SMALL> second son in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, for he knew that <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> had another son, <SMALL>REHOBOAM</SMALL>, who was six years old at that time and had been begotten in lawful marriage, whilst he himself was the son of an unmarried mother. <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> promised to give him the kingdom of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, and wives and concubines, and argued and pleaded with him long and earnestly, but to no purpose (Chap. 37); <SMALL>BAYNA-LE&#7716;KEM</SMALL> said that he had sworn by his mother's breasts to return to her quickly, and not to marry a wife in <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>. To swear by a woman's breasts was a serious matter, and we have an echo of a somewhat similar ceremony in the Annals of the Nubian <SMALL>NASTASEN</SMALL>, King of <SMALL>NUBIA</SMALL> after 500 <SMALL>B.C.</SMALL> (?). This king paid a visit to the goddess <SMALL>BAST</SMALL> of <SMALL>TERT</SMALL>, his good mother, and he says that she gave him life, great old age, happiness, [and] her two breasts [on] the left (?) side, and placed him in her living, beautiful bosom."<A NAME="page_lxxx_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_lxxx_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> We may be certain that <SMALL>NASTASEN</SMALL> swore to do something in return for the gracious kindness of the goddess <SMALL>BAST</SMALL>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> saw that it was impossible to keep <SMALL>BAYNA-LE&#7716;KEM</SMALL> in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, he summoned the elders of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> (Chap. 38) and declared to them his intention of making the young man King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, and asked them to send their eldest sons with him to that far country to found a Jewish colony and kingdom there. The elders of course agreed to the king's request, and then <SMALL>ZADOK</SMALL> the priest and <SMALL>BENAIAH</SMALL>, the son of <SMALL>JEHOIADA</SMALL>, anointed <SMALL>BAYNA-LE&#7716;KEM</SMALL> king in the Holy of Holies (Chap. 39); the name which he received at his anointing was <SMALL>DAVID [II]</SMALL>, the name of his grandfather. Then <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> commanded <SMALL>ZADOK</SMALL> to describe to the young King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> the curses that would fall upon him if



<A NAME="page_lxxxi"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxxi</FONT></A>

he failed to obey God's commands (Chap. 40), and the blessings that would accrue to him if he performed the Will of God (Chap. 41). <SMALL>ZADOK</SMALL> did so, and then recited the Ten Commandments (Chap. 42) as given by <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL>, and a number of Hebrew laws concerning marriage, adultery, fornication, incest, sodomy, &amp;c. The anointing of <SMALL>SOLOMON'S</SMALL> son to be king over <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> was pleasing to the people, but all those whose first-born sons were to leave <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> with him sorrowed and cursed <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> secretly in their hearts. In Chap. 43 we have a list of the names of those who were to hold positions of honour under <SMALL>DAVID II</SMALL> in <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, and Chap. 44 contains a series of warnings against abusing and reviling kings.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the children of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> who were to go to <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> sorrowed greatly at the thought of leaving their country, but the matter that troubled them most was leaving the Tabernacle of the Law of God behind them (Chap. 45). At length <SMALL>AZARYAS</SMALL> suggested that they should take <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> with them, and having sworn his fellow sufferers to secrecy he declared to them the plan which he had devised. This was simple enough, for he determined to have a box made of the same size and shape as the Tabernacle, and when he had taken the Tabernacle out of the Holy of Holies, to set it in its place. He collected 140 double drachmas and employed a carpenter to construct the box he required. In the Arabic version of the story it is <SMALL>SOLOMON'S</SMALL> son who has the box made, and he puts the carpenter to death as soon as he had made it, knowing that dead men tell no tales. One night whilst these things were being carried out <SMALL>AZARYAS</SMALL> had a dream in which God told him to make <SMALL>BAYNA-LE&#7716;KEM</SMALL> offer up a sacrifice before he departed to <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, and during the performance of the ceremony to bring the Tabernacle out from the Holy of Holies into the fore part of the Temple (Chap. 46). <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> agreed to the offering being made, and provided animals for sacrifice (Chap. 47). When the offering had been made, the Angel of



<A NAME="page_lxxxii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxxii</FONT></A>

the Lord appeared to <SMALL>AZARYAS</SMALL> (Chap. 48), and having opened the doors of the Holy of Holies with the keys which he had in his hand, he told him to go and bring in the box that had been made to replace the Tabernacle. When he had done this <SMALL>AZARYAS</SMALL>, and <SMALL>ELMEYAS</SMALL>, and <SMALL>ABESA</SMALL>, and <SMALL>MAKARI</SMALL> brought out the Tabernacle and carried it into the house of <SMALL>AZARYAS</SMALL>, and then they returned to the Temple and put together the box that was to replace the Tabernacle, and locked the doors, and came out. <SMALL>BAYNA-LE&#7716;KEM</SMALL>, who was well acquainted with all that had been done, then went and bade <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> farewell, and received his father's blessing (Chap. 49). Then <SMALL>AZARYAS</SMALL> set the Tabernacle <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> upon a wagon and covered it over with baggage of all kinds (Chap. 50), and accompanied by the cries of men, the wailings of women, the howlings of dogs, and the screams of asses, it was driven out of <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>. Both <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> and his people knew instinctively that the glory of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> had departed with it. Then <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> told <SMALL>ZADOK</SMALL> the priest to go into the Holy of Holies and bring out the covering of the Tabernacle, and to spread over the Tabernacle in its stead the new covering which he had had specially made for the purpose (Chap. 51); and thus saying he placed the new covering in the bands of the high priest. The Queen of <SMALL>SHEBA</SMALL> had asked him for a piece of the fringe of the covering of the Tabernacle, and she had repeated her request by the mouth of her son, and <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> determined to send the complete covering to her. The text mentions the "five mice and ten emerods" which were given to <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, but it is not clear whether <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> meant them to be given to the Queen with the covering of the Tabernacle. Acting on <SMALL>SOLOMON'S</SMALL> instructions, <SMALL>ZADOK</SMALL> went and fetched the covering of the Tabernacle (Chap. 52), and gave it to <SMALL>BAYNA-LE&#7716;KEM</SMALL>, or <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, together with a chain of gold.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the wagons were loaded, and <SMALL>BAYNA-LE&#7716;KEM</SMALL>



<A NAME="page_lxxxiii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxxiii</FONT></A>

and his companions set out on their journey. The Archangel <SMALL>MICHAEL</SMALL> led the way, and he cut a path for them, and sheltered them from the heat. Neither man nor beast touched the ground with their feet, but were carried along above the ground with the speed of the bat and the eagle, and even the wagons were borne along without touching the earth (Chap. 52).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SMALL>MICHAEL</SMALL> halted the company at <SMALL>G&Acirc;Z&Acirc;</SMALL>, which city <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> had given to the Queen of <SMALL>SHEBA</SMALL>, and another day's march brought them to the frontier of <SMALL>EGYPT</SMALL>, and they encamped by "the River" (<SMALL>TAKKAZI</SMALL>), i.e. the <SMALL>NILE</SMALL>. Thus they had performed in one day a journey that generally took the caravans thirteen days to complete (Chap. 53). Whilst they were here his companions took the opportunity of revealing to <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> the fact that they had carried off the Tabernacle <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, and that it was there with them. <SMALL>AZARYAS</SMALL> told <SMALL>ELMEYAS</SMALL> to "beautify and dress our Lady", and when <SMALL>DAVID II</SMALL> saw her he rose up and skipped like a young sheep, and danced before the Tabernacle even as did his grandfather <SMALL>DAVID I</SMALL> (2 Sam. vi. 14). Then he stood up before <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> and made the address to her which is given in Chap. 54. When the natives heard that the Tabernacle of the Law of God was in their midst, they beat drums and played upon flutes and pipes, and the people shouted, and the pylons of the temples, and the idols that were in the forms of men, and dogs, and cats, fell down and were broken in pieces (Chaps. 54, 55). And <SMALL>AZARYAS</SMALL> dressed <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, and spread their gifts before her, and he set her on a wagon with draperies of purple about her. On the following morning <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> and his company resumed their journey, and men and beasts and wagons were all raised above the ground to the height of one cubit as before. They passed through the air like shadows, and the people ran alongside <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> and worshipped her. When they came to the <SMALL>RED SEA</SMALL> <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> passed over its waters, and the whole company were raised above



<A NAME="page_lxxxiv"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxxiv</FONT></A>

them to a height of three cubits. The waves leaped up to welcome <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, and the billows thundered forth praise of her, and the breakers roared their acclamations, and all the creatures in the sea worshipped her as she passed over them. In due course the company arrived at a place opposite Mount <SMALL>SINAI</SMALL> and encamped in <SMALL>K&Acirc;D&Ecirc;S</SMALL>, and then passing through <SMALL>MEDY&Acirc;M</SMALL> and <SMALL>B&Ecirc;L&Ocirc;NT&Ocirc;S</SMALL> they came to <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, where they were received with great rejoicings. The description of the route followed by <SMALL>DAVID II</SMALL> is very vague, and it is clear that <SMALL>ISAAC'S</SMALL> geographical knowledge was incomplete.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile <SMALL>ZADOK</SMALL> had returned from the Temple in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> to <SMALL>SOLOMON'S</SMALL> palace and found the king very sorrowful, for he had been thinking over the dream which he had twenty-two years before, and feared that the glory of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> had either departed or was about to depart. <SMALL>ZADOK</SMALL> was greatly troubled when he heard what the king's dream was, and prophesied woe to <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> if the Tabernacle had been carried off by <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>. <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> asked him if he had made sure that the Tabernacle was in the Holy of Holies the day before when he removed the outside covering to give it to <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, and <SMALL>ZADOK</SMALL> said he had not done so (Chap. 56). Then <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> told him to go at once and see, and when he had gone into the Holy of Holies he found there nothing but the box which <SMALL>AZARYAS</SMALL> had had made to take the place of the Tabernacle. When <SMALL>ZADOK</SMALL> saw that <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> had departed he fainted, and <SMALL>BENAIAH</SMALL> found him lying there like a dead man. When <SMALL>ZADOK</SMALL> revived he cast ashes on his head, and went to the doors of the Temple and in a loud voice bewailed the loss of the glory and protection of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>. When <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> heard the news he commanded men to make ready to pursue those who had stolen <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, and to slay them when they found them (Chap. 57). When the soldiers were ready <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> set himself at their head, and his mounted scouts rode in all



<A NAME="page_lxxxv"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxxv</FONT></A>

haste to <SMALL>EGYPT</SMALL>, where they learned that the fugitives had left the place nine days before (Chap. 58). When <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> himself arrived at <SMALL>G&Acirc;Z&Acirc;</SMALL> he found that the report which his scouts had made to him was true, and his heart sank. Near <SMALL>EGYPT</SMALL> he met envoys of <SMALL>PHARAOH</SMALL> who had been sent to him with presents, and he asked one of them for news of the thieves. This man told him that he had seen the company of <SMALL>DAVID II</SMALL> in <SMALL>CAIRO</SMALL> travelling through the air, and that all the statues of kings and gods in <SMALL>EGYPT</SMALL> had fallen down in the presence of the Tabernacle of <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, and were dashed in pieces (Chap. 59). When <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> heard this he returned to his tent and wept bitterly, and gave vent to the lamentations that form (Chap. 60).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> returned to <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> he went with the elders into the House of God, and he and <SMALL>ZADOK</SMALL> embraced each other and wept bitterly. Then they dried their tears and the elders made a long speech to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> in which they sketched the past history of the Ark of the Covenant, i.e. the Tabernacle <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>. They reminded him how the <SMALL>PHILISTINES</SMALL> captured it and carried it into the house of <SMALL>DAGON</SMALL>, and how they sent it away with sixty gold figures of mice, and sixty phalli, and how, when it came to <SMALL>JUDAH</SMALL>, the men of <SMALL>DAN</SMALL> slew the camels that drew the wagon on which it travelled, and cut up and burnt the wagon, and how it withdrew to its place and was ministered to by <SMALL>SAMUEL</SMALL>, and how it refused to be carried to the Valley of <SMALL>GILBOA</SMALL>, and how <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, the father of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, brought it from <SMALL>SAMARIA</SMALL> to <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>. They proved to the king that the Tabernacle <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> could not have been carried off against God's will, and that if it was God's will it would return to <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, and if it was not then it would not. Of one thing they were quite certain: the Tabernacle was able to take care of itself (Chap. 61).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> had heard all they had to say he agreed with them that the Will of God was irresistible, and



<A NAME="page_lxxxvi"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxxvi</FONT></A>

called upon them to kneel down with him in the Holy of Holies (Chap. 62). When they had poured out prayer and supplication and dried their tears, <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> advised them to keep the matter of the theft a secret among themselves, so that the uncircumcised might not boast over their misfortune. At his suggestion the elders set up the box which <SMALL>AZARYAS</SMALL> had made, and covered the boards over with gold, and decorated the box with coverings, and placed a copy of the Book of the Law inside it in lieu of the Two Tables. They remembered that <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> the free was as the heavens, and that their own earthly <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> was the Gate of Heaven, and they determined to do God's Will so that He Himself might be ever with them to watch over <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> and to protect His people. The suggestion is that God would be a better protector than even the Tabernacle <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the loss of the Tabernacle <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> had a sad effect upon <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, for his love for God waned, and his wisdom forsook him, and he devoted himself to women during the last eleven years of his life. He married <SMALL> M&Acirc;&#7730;SH&Acirc;R&Acirc;</SMALL>, an Egyptian princess, who first seduced his household into worshipping her idols, and then worked upon him with her beauty in such a way that he tolerated all she said and did (Chap. 63). When she knew that <SMALL>DAVID II</SMALL> had stolen the Tabernacle <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, she reminded <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> that his Lady <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> had been carried off, and that it would be better for him now to worship the gods of her fathers; but for a time he refused to forsake the God of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>. One day, however, overcome by her beauty he promised to do whatsoever she wished. Thereupon she tied a scarlet thread across the door of her gods, and she placed three locusts in the house of her gods. Then she called upon <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> to enter without breaking the thread, and to kill the locusts and "pull out their necks." In some way, which I cannot explain, in doing this <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> performed an act



<A NAME="page_lxxxvii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxxvii</FONT></A>

of worship of the Egyptian gods, and <SMALL> M&Acirc;&#7730;SH&Acirc;R&Acirc;</SMALL> was content; besides this, to enter into an Egyptian temple was an offence against the God of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> (Chaps. 64, 65). In spite of his weakness and sin, <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> is regarded in some respects as a type of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>, and as he committed no sin like that of his father <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> in the matter of the murder of <SMALL>URIAH</SMALL>, he is enumerated with the Patriarchs (Chap. 66).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> was sixty years of age he fell sick, and the Angel of Death drew nigh to him, and he wept and prayed for mercy (Chap. 67). And the Angel of God came to him and rebuked him for his excessive love of women and for marrying alien women. In a long speech the Angel refers to <SMALL>SOLOMON'S</SMALL> three sons, i.e. <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> and <SMALL>REHOBOAM</SMALL> and <SMALL>&#8217;ADR&Acirc;M&Icirc;</SMALL>, his son by a Greek slave, and then he shows him how <SMALL>JOSEPH</SMALL>, and <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL>, and <SMALL>JOSHUA</SMALL>, were types of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>, and how <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> should spring from <SMALL>SOLOMON'S</SMALL> seed and redeem mankind. In Chap. 68 the Angel prophesies concerning the <SMALL>VIRGIN MARY</SMALL>, and narrates to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> the history of the Pearl which passed from the body of <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL> to <SMALL>ABRAHAM</SMALL>, <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL>, <SMALL>JACOB</SMALL>, <SMALL>PEREZ</SMALL>, <SMALL>JESSE</SMALL>, <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, <SMALL>REHOBOAM</SMALL>, and <SMALL>JOACHIM</SMALL>, who passed it into the body of <SMALL>&#7716;ANNA</SMALL>, the mother of the <SMALL>VIRGIN MARY</SMALL>. Finally, the Angel told <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> that <SMALL>MICHAEL</SMALL> would remain with the Tabernacle in <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, and he (<SMALL>GABRIEL</SMALL>) with <SMALL>REHOBOAM</SMALL>, and <SMALL>URIEL</SMALL> with <SMALL>&#8217;ADR&Acirc;M&Icirc;</SMALL>. And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> gave thanks to God, and asked the Angel when the Saviour would come (Chap. 69), and the Angel replied, "After three and thirty generations." When the Angel told him that the <SMALL>ISRAELITES</SMALL> would crucify the Saviour, and be scattered over the face of the earth, <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> wept, and the words of his lamentations fill the rest of Chap. 69.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> died, and <SMALL>ZADOK</SMALL> anointed <SMALL>REHOBOAM</SMALL> king, and when he had laid a wooden tablet,<A NAME="page_lxxxvii_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_lxxxvii_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> with <SMALL>SOLOMON'S</SMALL></P>



<A NAME="page_lxxxviii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxxviii</FONT></A>

name inserted upon it, upon the Tabernacle, the people set him on the royal mule and cried, Hail! Long live the royal father (Chap. 70). Owing to <SMALL>REHOBOAM'S</SMALL> arrogant behaviour the people revolted, and they armed themselves and went to <SMALL>B&Ecirc;TH EFR&Acirc;T&Acirc;</SMALL>, and made <SMALL>JEROBOAM</SMALL>, the son of <SMALL>NEBAT</SMALL>, king over them. From <SMALL>REHOBOAM</SMALL> to <SMALL>JOACHIM</SMALL>, the grandfather of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>, were forty-one generations. The <SMALL>VIRGIN MARY</SMALL> and <SMALL>JOSEPH</SMALL> the carpenter were akin, each being descended from <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, King of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> (Chap. 71).

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to traditions which <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL> has grouped in Chap. 72, <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M</SMALL>, <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc;</SMALL>, or <SMALL>R&Ucirc;M</SMALL>, i.e. <SMALL>BYZANTIUM</SMALL>, was originally the inheritance of <SMALL>JAPHET</SMALL>, the son of <SMALL>NOAH</SMALL>. He attributes the building of <SMALL>ANTIOCH</SMALL>, <SMALL>TYRE</SMALL>, <SMALL>PARTHIA</SMALL> (?) and <SMALL>CONSTANTINOPLE</SMALL> (?) to <SMALL>DARIUS</SMALL>, and says that from <SMALL>DARIUS</SMALL> to <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> there were eighteen generations. One of his descendants, an astrologer and clockmaker called <SMALL>ZANBAR&Ecirc;S</SMALL>, prophesied that <SMALL>BYZANTIUM</SMALL> would pass into the possession of the sons of <SMALL>SHEM</SMALL>. His daughter married <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, who begot by her a son called <SMALL>&#8217;ADR&Acirc;M&Icirc;</SMALL>, and this son married <SMALL>&#8217;ADL&Ocirc;NY&Acirc;</SMALL>, the daughter of <SMALL>BAL&#7788;AS&Ocirc;R</SMALL>, the King of <SMALL>BYZANTIUM</SMALL>. When <SMALL>&#8217;ADR&Acirc;M&Icirc;</SMALL> was living in <SMALL>BYZANTIUM</SMALL> with his wife, his father-in-law, wishing to test his ability as a judge, set him to try a difficult case of trespass on the part of a flock of sheep on the one side and unlawful detention of property on the other (Chap. 72). He decided the case in such a way as to gain the approval of <SMALL>BAL&#7788;AS&Ocirc;R</SMALL>, and in due course he reigned in his stead (Chap. 73). <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL> further proves that the King of <SMALL>MEDY&Acirc;M</SMALL> (Chap. 74) and the King of <SMALL>BABYLON</SMALL> were <SMALL>SEMITES</SMALL> (Chap. 75). The narrative of <SMALL>KARM&Icirc;N</SMALL> and the false swearing of <SMALL>ZARY&Ocirc;S</SMALL> and <SMALL>K&Acirc;RM&Ecirc;L&Ocirc;S</SMALL>, the flight of <SMALL>KARM&Icirc;N</SMALL> to <SMALL>BABYLON</SMALL>, the infidelity of the merchant's wife, and the exchange of children by the nurses, together make up a story more suitable for the "One Thousand Nights and a Night" than the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL>. According to it <SMALL>NEBUCHADNEZZAR II</SMALL>



<A NAME="page_lxxxix"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. lxxxix</FONT></A>

was the son of <SMALL>KARM&Icirc;N</SMALL>, and therefore a <SMALL>SEMITE</SMALL>; the etymology given of the name is, of course, wholly wrong (Chap. 76). In Chap. 77 <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL> tries to show that the King of <SMALL>PERSIA</SMALL> was a <SMALL>SEMITE</SMALL>, and that he was descended from <SMALL>PEREZ</SMALL>, a son of <SMALL>TAMAR</SMALL>. The incestuous origin of the <SMALL>MOABITES</SMALL> and <SMALL>AMALEKITES</SMALL>, as described in <SMALL>GENESIS</SMALL>, is repeated in Chaps. 78 and 79.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Chap. 80 is the history of <SMALL>SAMSON</SMALL> with details of an apocryphal character. According to this, <SMALL>SAMSON</SMALL> married a woman of the <SMALL>PHILISTINES</SMALL>, and so transgressed the Will of God. The <SMALL>PHILISTINES</SMALL> made him act the buffoon, and in revenge he pulled the roof down upon them and slew 700,000 of them, and 700,000 more with iron and stone, and wood and the jaw-bone of an ass. When <SMALL>SAMSON</SMALL> died he left <SMALL>DELILAH</SMALL>, the sister of <SMALL>MAKS&Acirc;B&Acirc;</SMALL>, wife of <SMALL>&#7730;W&Ocirc;L&Acirc;S&Ocirc;N</SMALL>, King of the <SMALL>PHILISTINES</SMALL>, with child. After <SMALL>SAMSON</SMALL> had slain <SMALL>&#7730;W&Ocirc;L&Acirc;S&Ocirc;N</SMALL> the two sisters lived together, and in due course each brought forth a man child. The boys grew up together, and their mothers dressed them in rich apparel, and hung chains round their necks, and gave them daggers to wear. One day <SMALL>AKAM&#7716;&Ecirc;L</SMALL>, <SMALL>SAMSON'S</SMALL> son, asked his mother why he was not reigning over the city, and told her that he intended to reign over <SMALL>PHILISTIA</SMALL>. A little time later the two boys were eating with their mothers, and <SMALL>AKAM&#7716;&Ecirc;L</SMALL> took from the dish a piece of meat as large as his two hands, and began to eat it. <SMALL>&#7788;EBR&Ecirc;L&Ecirc;S</SMALL>, the son of <SMALL>MAKS&Acirc;B&Acirc;</SMALL>, snatched a piece of the meat from him, whereupon <SMALL>AKAM&#7716;&Ecirc;L</SMALL> drew his dagger and cut off the head of <SMALL>&#7788;EBR&Ecirc;L&Ecirc;S</SMALL>, which fell into the dish. <SMALL>DELILAH</SMALL> seized the sword from the body of <SMALL>&#7788;EBR&Ecirc;L&Ecirc;S</SMALL> and tried to kill <SMALL>AKAM&#7716;&Ecirc;L</SMALL>, but he hid behind a pillar and in turn tried to kill her. When <SMALL>MAKS&Acirc;B&Acirc;</SMALL> strove to pacify him he turned on the two women like a wild bear and drove them from the apartment. Before she left <SMALL>MAKS&Acirc;B&Acirc;</SMALL> gave him purple cloths from her couch, and promised

him the throne of <SMALL>PHILISTIA</SMALL>, and that evening <SMALL>AKAM&#7716;&Ecirc;L</SMALL> took possession of it and was acclaimed king. In Chaps. 82 and 83 the well-known story of <SMALL>ABRAHAM'S</SMALL> visit to <SMALL>EGYPT</SMALL> with <SMALL>SARAH</SMALL> is told, and a description of <SMALL>ISHMAEL'S</SMALL> kingdom is added.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SMALL>ISAAC'S</SMALL> narrative now returns to <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL>. He and his company and <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> travelled from <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> to <SMALL>WA&#7730;&Ecirc;R&Ocirc;</SMALL> in one day, and he sent messengers to <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL>, his mother, to announce their arrival (Chap. 84). In due course he arrived at <SMALL>DABRA M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> (<SMALL>AXUM</SMALL> ?), the seat of his mother's Government, where the Queen was waiting to receive him. He pitched his tent in the plain at the foot of the mountain, and 32,000 stalled oxen and bulls were killed and a great feast was made. Seven hundred swordsmen were appointed to watch over <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> (Chap. 85), and the Queen and all her people rejoiced. On the third day <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> abdicated in favour of her son <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL>, and she handed over to him 17,700 fine horses and 7,700 mares, 1,700 mules, robes of honour, and a large quantity of gold and silver (Chap. 86). Further, she made the nobles swear that henceforth no woman should rule over <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> (Chap. 87), and that only the male offspring of her son <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> should be kings of that country. At the coming of <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> to <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> the people cast away their idols, and abandoned divination, and sorcery, and magic, and omens, and repented with tears, and adopted the religion of the <SMALL>HEBREWS</SMALL>. <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> swore to render obedience to his mother, and <SMALL>AZARYAS</SMALL> was to be high priest and <SMALL>ALMEYAS</SMALL> Keeper of <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, the Ark of the Covenant. <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> then related to <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> the story of his anointing by <SMALL>ZADOK</SMALL> in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, and when she heard it she admonished him to observe the Will of God, and to put his trust in <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>; and she called upon <SMALL>AZARYAS</SMALL> and <SMALL>ALMEYAS</SMALL> to help him to follow the path of righteousness (Chap. 88). She then addressed a long speech to her nobles (Chap. 89) and the new <SMALL>ISRAELITES</SMALL>, and



<A NAME="page_xci"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xci</FONT></A>

prayed to God for wisdom and understanding. Her prayer was followed by an edict ordering every man to forsake the religion and manners and customs which he had formerly observed, and to adopt the new religion under penalty of the confiscation of his property and separation from his wife and children. In Chaps. 90 and 91, <SMALL>AZARYAS</SMALL> makes an address to <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> and praises her for her wisdom. He compares favourably the country of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> with <SMALL>JUDAH</SMALL>, and says that, although the <SMALL>ETHIOPIANS</SMALL> are black of face, nothing can do them any harm provided that God lighteth their hearts. He then proclaims a number of laws, derived for the most part from the Pentateuch, and appends a list of clean and unclean animals. Curiously enough, a short paragraph is devoted to the explanation of the Queen's name <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> (page 161). When <SMALL>AZARYAS</SMALL> had finished his exhortations he made preparations to "renew the Kingdom of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>", King of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, in <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> (Chap. 92), and with the blowing of the jubilee trumpets and music and singing and dancing and games of all kinds, <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL>, or <SMALL>DAVID II</SMALL>, was formally proclaimed King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>. The boundaries of his kingdom are carefully described. After the three months that followed the proclamation of <SMALL>MENYELEK'S</SMALL> sovereignty, the Law of the Kingdom and the Creed of the <SMALL>ETHIOPIANS</SMALL> were written, presumably upon skins, and deposited in the Ark of the Covenant as a "memorial for the later days" (Chap. 93). <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL> says that the belief of the Kings of <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc;</SMALL> (<SMALL>R&Ucirc;M&Icirc;</SMALL>) and that of the Kings of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> was identical for 130 years, but that after that period the former corrupted the Faith of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> by introducing into it the heresies of <SMALL>NESTORIUS</SMALL>, <SMALL>ARIUS</SMALL> and others.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after <SMALL>MENYELEK</SMALL> had established his kingdom, he set out, accompanied by the Ark of the Covenant and <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL> (Chap. 94), to wage war against his enemies. He attacked the peoples to the west, south, and east of his country, and invaded the lands of the <SMALL>NUBIANS</SMALL>,



<A NAME="page_xcii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xcii</FONT></A>

<SMALL>EGYPTIANS</SMALL>, <SMALL>ARABIANS</SMALL>, and <SMALL>INDIANS</SMALL>; and many kings sent him tribute and did homage to him. The Ark of the Covenant went at the head of his army, and made the <SMALL>ETHIOPIANS</SMALL> victorious everywhere; many peoples were blotted out and whole districts laid waste. In Chap. 95 <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL> couples the King of <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc;</SMALL> with the King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, and condemns the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> for their ill-treatment of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>, Who was born of the Pearl that was hidden in <SMALL>ADAM'S</SMALL> body when he was created. And <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL> proclaims what the <SMALL>KEBRA NAGAST</SMALL> was written to prove, namely, that "the King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> is more exalted and more honourable than any other king upon the earth, because of the glory and greatness of the heavenly <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>." Following several remarks, in which the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> are compared unfavourably with the <SMALL>ETHIOPIANS</SMALL>, comes a long extract from the writings of <SMALL>GREGORY</SMALL>, the "worker of wonders" (<SMALL>THAUMATURGUS</SMALL>), in which it is shown that the coming of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> was known to the Prophets of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, and passages from their books are quoted in support of this view. The beginning of all things was the Law which proclaimed <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>, and the Holy Spirit existed at the Creation. The brazen serpent was a symbol of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> (Chap. 96). <SMALL>ABRAHAM</SMALL> was a type of God the Father, and <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL> a symbol of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>, the ram of sacrifice. <SMALL>EVE</SMALL> slew mankind, but the <SMALL>VIRGIN MARY</SMALL> gave them life. <SMALL>MARY</SMALL> was the "door", and that it was closed symbolized her virginity, which was God's seal upon her. She was the burning bush described by <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL>; she was the censer used by <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL>, the coals were <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>, and the perfume of the incense was His perfume (Chap. 97), on which prayer ascended to heaven. The chains of the censer were <SMALL>JACOB'S</SMALL> ladder. <SMALL>AARON'S</SMALL> rod was <SMALL>MARY</SMALL>, and the bud thereof was <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> (Chap. 98). The Ark made by <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL> was the abode of God on earth; it symbolized <SMALL>MARY</SMALL>, and the indestructible wood of which it was made symbolized the indestructible <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>. The pot that held the manna was <SMALL>MARY</SMALL>, and the manna was



<A NAME="page_xciii"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xciii</FONT></A>

the body of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>; the Words of the Law also were <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>. The Pearl in <SMALL>MARY'S</SMALL> body was <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>. The rock smitten by <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL> was <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>, and <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL> smote it lengthwise and breadthwise to symbolize the Cross of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>. <SMALL>MOSES' ROD</SMALL> was the Cross, the water that flowed from the rock was the teaching of the Apostles. The darkness brought upon <SMALL>EGYPT</SMALL> for three days symbolized the darkness of the Crucifixion. The <SMALL>AMALEKITES</SMALL> symbolized the devils, and <SMALL>AARON</SMALL> and <SMALL>H&Ocirc;R</SMALL>, who held up <SMALL>MOSES'</SMALL> hands, symbolized the two thieves who were crucified with <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>. In a parable given in Chap. 99 a king symbolizes <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>, and <SMALL>SATAN</SMALL> an arrogant servant and <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL> a humble servant.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of the angels who rebelled is given in Chap. 100. These angels were wroth with God for creating <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL>, and they reviled God and <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL> because of his transgression. God reminded them that <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL> was only a creature made of dust and water and wind and fire, whilst they were made of air and fire. They were made specially to praise God, whilst <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL> could be influenced by <SMALL>SATAN</SMALL>; had they been made of water and dust they would have sinned more than <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL>. In answer the angels said, "Make us even as <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL>, and put us to the test "; and God gave them flesh and blood and a heart like that of the children of men. Thereupon they came down to earth, mingled with the children of <SMALL>CAIN</SMALL>, and gave themselves up to singing, dancing, and fornication. The daughters of <SMALL>CAIN</SMALL> scented themselves to please the men who had been angels, and were debauched by any and every man who cared to take them. And they conceived, but were unable to bring forth their children in the natural way, and the children split open their mothers' bodies and came forth. These children grew up into giants, and their "height reached unto the clouds." God bore with them for 120 years, and then the waters of the Flood destroyed them. He



<A NAME="page_xciv"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xciv</FONT></A>

told <SMALL>NOAH</SMALL> to build an Ark, and it was the wood of that Ark that saved him, as the wood of the Cross saved mankind when <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> died upon it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Chap. 101 God is made to declare by the mouth of <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL> that He is everywhere and in everything, and that everything supports itself on Him; He is the Master of everything, He fills everything, He is above the Seven Heavens and everything, He is beneath the deepest deep and the thickest darkness, and balances all creation. In Chap. 102 is a series of extracts from the Old and New Testaments which are to show that <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> was the Beginning, and that all things were made in and by Him. He was the Maker and Creator, the Light of Light, the God of God, the Refuge, the Feeder, and the Director. The Ark, or Tabernacle, symbolizes the horns of the altar and the tomb of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>. The offering on the altar symbolizes and is the Body of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> (Chap. 103). Returning to the Ark of <SMALL>NOAH</SMALL> (Chap. 104), the writer says that <SMALL>NOAH</SMALL> was saved by wood, <SMALL>ABRAHAM</SMALL> held converse with God in the wood of <SMALL>MANBAR</SMALL>, the thicket that caught the ram saved <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL>, and the rods of wood that <SMALL>JACOB</SMALL> laid in running water saved him. The wood of the Ark made by <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL> was a means of salvation, even as was the wood of the Cross. The greater part of this Chapter appears to be a translation of a part of a homily by <SMALL>CYRIL</SMALL>, Archbishop of <SMALL>ALEXANDRIA</SMALL>, and it is possible that Chap. 105 is merely a continuation of Chap. 104. It deals with <SMALL>ABRAHAM'S</SMALL> visit to <SMALL>MELCHIZEDEK</SMALL>, who gave him the mystery of bread and wine, which is also celebrated in "our Passover." Prophecies concerning the Coming of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>, collected from the Books of the Old Testament, are given in Chap. 106, but <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL> or the copyists have made many mistakes as to their authorship, especially in the case of some of the Minor Prophets. Many appear to have been written down from memory. Another series of prophecies concerning <SMALL>CHRIST'S</SMALL> triumphal entry into



<A NAME="page_xcv"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xcv</FONT></A>

<SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> is given in Chap. 107, and <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> is identified with the unicorn. Prophecies dealing with the wickedness of the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> are given in Chap. 108, Chap. 109 consists of prophecies concerning the Crucifixion; in Chaps. 110 and 111 many prophecies foretelling the Resurrection and Ascension of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> and His Second Coming are enumerated. The Patriarchs and Prophets were forerunners and symbols of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> (Chap. 112), especially <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL>, <SMALL>JACOB</SMALL>, <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL>, <SMALL>JOSEPH</SMALL>, and <SMALL>JONAH</SMALL>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chariot containing <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, i.e. the vehicle on which the Tabernacle of the Law was borne, was in <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, and the Cross, which was discovered by Queen Helena, was in <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc;</SMALL> (<SMALL>R&Ucirc;M&Icirc;</SMALL>), and the Archbishops asked <SMALL>GREGORY</SMALL> how long the chariot of <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> and the Cross were to remain where they were (Chap. 113). <SMALL>GREGORY</SMALL> replied that the Persians would attack the King of <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc;</SMALL>, and defeat him, and make him a prisoner, together with the horse of the Cross, which would go mad, and rush into the sea and perish. But the nails of the Cross would shine in the sea until the Second Coming of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>. On the other hand, the chariot of <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> would remain in <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, and the <SMALL>ETHIOPIANS</SMALL> would continue to be orthodox to the end of the world. At the Second Coming of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> the Tabernacle of the Law shall return to Mount <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> (Chap. 114), and it shall be opened, and the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> shall be made to look upon the Words of the Law that they have despised, the pot of manna, and the rod of <SMALL>AARON</SMALL>. Chap. 115 described the judgement which shall fall upon the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL>, who shall repent when it is too late and shall be cast into hell. Of the <SMALL>CHRISTIANS</SMALL> those who have sinned shall be punished according to the degree of their sins. One day with God is as a thousand years; some shall be punished for a whole day, some for twelve hours, some for three, and some for one hour. Others shall be tried and acquitted. In answer to a further question of the Archbishops <SMALL>GREGORY</SMALL> repeats (Chap. 116) that the



<A NAME="page_xcvi"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. xcvi</FONT></A>

chariot of <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> shall remain in <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> until the Second Coming of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>, and prophesies the war which the King of <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc;</SMALL> will wage in <SMALL>ARMENIA</SMALL>, and the war which the <SMALL>ETHIOPIANS</SMALL> will make on the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> of <SMALL>N&Acirc;GR&Acirc;N</SMALL>.<A NAME="page_xcchariot_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_xcchariot_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> The last Chapter (117) deals with the extermination of the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> and the <SMALL>ARMENIANS</SMALL> by the joint efforts of <SMALL>JUSTINUS</SMALL>, King of <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc;</SMALL>, and <SMALL>K&Acirc;L&Ecirc;B</SMALL>, King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, who are to meet in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, and exchange titles. The war of the <SMALL>ETHIOPIANS</SMALL> against the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> of <SMALL>N&Acirc;GR&Acirc;N</SMALL> is to be continued by <SMALL>GABRA MAS&#7730;AL</SMALL> or <SMALL>L&Acirc;L&Icirc;BAL&Acirc;</SMALL>, after his father <SMALL>K&Acirc;L&Ecirc;B</SMALL> has adopted the monastic life in the Monastery of Abb&acirc; <SMALL>PANTALERN</SMALL>, and their defeat by him is declared to be a certainty. Parts of the text of this Chapter are difficult to understand.</P>
