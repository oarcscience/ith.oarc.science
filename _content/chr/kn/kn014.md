### 14. *Concerning the Covenant of* <span class="small">ABRAHAM</span>

   And God held converse with <span class="small">ABRÂM</span>, and He
said unto him, "Fear thou not. From this day thou art My servant, <span
id="page_11">p. 11</span> and I will establish My Covenant with thee and
with thy seed after thee, and I will multiply thy seed, and I will
magnify thy name exceedingly. And I will bring down the Tabernacle of My
Covenant upon the earth seven generations after thee, and it shall go
round about with thy seed, and shall be salvation unto thy race and
afterwards I will send My Word for the salvation of <span
class="small">ADAM</span> and his sons for ever. And at this moment
these who are of thy kinsmen are evil men (or, rebels), and My divinity,
which is true, they have rejected. And as for thee, that day by day they
may not seduce thee, come, get thee forth out of this land, the land of
thy fathers, into the land which I will show thee, and I will give it
unto thy seed after thee."<span id="page_11_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_11_note_1) And <span
class="small">ABRÂM</span> made obeisance to God, and was subject to his
God. And \[God\] said unto him, "Thy name shall be <span
class="small">ABRAHAM</span>"; and He gave him the salutation of peace
and went up into heaven. And <span class="small">ABRAHAM</span> returned
to his abode, and he took <span class="small">SÂRÂ</span> (<span
class="small">SARAH</span>) his wife, and went forth and did not go back
to his father, and his mother, and his house, and his kinsfolk; and he
forsook them all for God's sake. And he arrived in the city of <span
class="small">SÂLÊM</span>, and dwelt there and reigned in
righteousness, and did not transgress the commandment of God. And God
blessed him exceedingly, and at length he possessed \[3\]18 stalwart
servants, who were trained in war, and who stood before him and
performed his will. And they wore tunics richly embroidered with gold,
and they had chains of gold about their necks, and belts of gold round
their loins, and they had crowns of gold on their heads; and by means of
these men <span class="small">ABRAHAM</span> vanquished \[his\] foe. And
he died in glory in God, and was more gracious and excellent than those
who were before him. He was gracious, and held in honour, and highly
esteemed.
