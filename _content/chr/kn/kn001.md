# THE GLORY OF KINGS

I<span class="small">N PRAISING GOD THE FATHER, THE SUSTAINER OF THE
UNIVERSE, AND HIS SON JESUS CHRIST, THROUGH WHOM EVERYTHING CAME INTO
BEING, AND WITHOUT WHOM NOTHING CAME INTO BEING, AND THE HOLY TRIUNE
SPIRIT, THE PARACLETE, WHO GOETH FORTH FROM THE FATHER, AND DERIVETH
FROM THE SON, WE BELIEVE IN AND ADORE THE TRINITY, ONE GOD, THE FATHER,
AND THE SON, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT.</span>

### 1. *Concerning the Glory of Kings*

   The interpretation and explanation of the Three Hundred and Eighteen
Orthodox \[Fathers\] concerning splendour, and greatness, and dignity,
and how God gave them to the children of <span
class="small">ADAM</span>, and especially concerning the greatness and
splendour of <span class="small">ZION</span>, the Tabernacle (*tâbôt*)
of the Law of God, of which He Himself is the Maker and Fashioner, in
the fortress of His holiness before all created things, \[both\] angels
and men. For the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit with good
fellowship and right good will and cordial agreement together made the
Heavenly <span class="small">ZION</span> to be the place of habitation
of their Glory. And then the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit
said, "Let Us make man in Our similitude and likeness,"<span
id="page_1_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_1_note_1) and with ready agreement
and good will They were all of this opinion. And the Son said, "I will
put on the body of <span class="small">ADAM</span>," and the Holy Spirit
said, "I will dwell in the heart\[s\] of the Prophets and the
Righteous," and this common agreement and covenant was \[fulfilled\] in
<span class="small">ZION</span>, the City of their Glory. <span
id="page_2">p. 2</span> And <span class="small">DAVID</span> said,
"Remember Thine agreement which Thou didst make of old for salvation,
the rod of Thine inheritance, in Mount <span class="small">ZION</span>
wherein Thou dost dwell."<span id="page_2_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_2_note_1)

   And He made <span class="small">ADAM</span> in His own image and
likeness, so that He might remove <span class="small">SATAN</span>
because of his pride, together with his host, and might establish <span
class="small">ADAM</span>—His own plant—together with the righteous, His
children, for His praises. For the plan of God was decided upon and
decreed in that He said, "I will become man, and I will be in everything
which I have created, I will abide in flesh." And in the days that came
after, by His good pleasure there was born in the flesh of the Second
<span class="small">ZION</span> the second <span
class="small">ADAM</span>, Who was our Saviour <span
class="small">CHRIST</span>. This is our glory and our faith, our hope
and our life, the Second <span class="small">ZION</span>.<span
