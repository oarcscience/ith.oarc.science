<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it was <SMALL>CANAAN</SMALL> who rent the kingdom from the children of <SMALL>SHEM</SMALL>, and he transgressed the oath which his father <SMALL>NOAH</SMALL> had made them to swear. And the sons of <SMALL>CANAAN</SMALL> were seven mighty men, and he took seven mighty cities from the land of <SMALL>SHEM</SMALL>, and set his sons over them; and likewise he also made his own portion double. And in later days God took vengeance upon the sons of <SMALL>CANAAN</SMALL>, and made the sons of <SMALL>SHEM</SMALL> to inherit their country. These are the nations whom they inherited: the <SMALL>CANAANITES</SMALL>, the <SMALL>PERIZZITES</SMALL>, the <SMALL>HIVITES</SMALL>, the <SMALL>HITTITES</SMALL>, the <SMALL>AMORITES</SMALL>, the <SMALL>JEBUSITES</SMALL>, and

the <SMALL>GIRGASITES</SMALL>; these are they whom <SMALL>CANAAN</SMALL> seized by force from the seed of <SMALL>SHEM</SMALL>. For it was not right for him to invade [his] kingdom, and to falsify the oath, and because of this they ceased to be, and their memorial perished, through transgressing [God's] command, and worshipping idols, and bowing down to those who were not gods.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after the death of <SMALL>SHEM</SMALL> <SMALL>ARPHAXAD</SMALL> reigned, and after the death of <SMALL>ARPHAXAD</SMALL> <SMALL>&#7730;&Acirc;YN&Acirc;N</SMALL><A NAME="page_9_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_9_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> (<SMALL>CAINAN</SMALL>) reigned, and after the death of <SMALL>&#7730;&Acirc;YN&Acirc;N</SMALL> <SMALL>S&Acirc;L&Acirc;</SMALL> (<SMALL>SALAH</SMALL>) reigned, and after him <SMALL>EBER</SMALL> reigned, and after him <SMALL>P&Acirc;L&Ecirc;&#7730;</SMALL> (<SMALL>PELEG</SMALL>) reigned, and after him <SMALL>R&Acirc;G&Acirc;W</SMALL> (<SMALL>REU</SMALL>) reigned, and after him <SMALL>S&Ecirc;R&Ocirc;&#7716;</SMALL> (<SMALL>SERUG</SMALL>) reigned, and after him <SMALL>N&Acirc;KH&Ocirc;R</SMALL> (<SMALL>NAHOR</SMALL>) reigned, and after him <SMALL>T&Acirc;R&Acirc;</SMALL> (<SMALL>TERAH</SMALL>) reigned. And these are they who made magical images, and they went to the tombs of their fathers and made an image (or, picture) of gold, and silver, and brass, and a devil used to hold converse with them out of each of the images of their fathers, and say unto them, "O my son So-and-so, offer up unto me as a sacrifice the son whom thou lovest." And they slaughtered their sons and their daughters to the devils, and they poured out innocent blood to filthy devils.</P>
