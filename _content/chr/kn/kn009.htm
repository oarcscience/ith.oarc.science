<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then <SMALL>NOAH</SMALL> the righteous man died, and <SMALL>SHEM</SMALL> reigned in wisdom and righteousness, for he was blessed by <SMALL>NOAH</SMALL>, saying, "Be God to thy brother."

And God said unto him, "I will make a covenant with thee that thou shalt tell thy children they shall not eat
