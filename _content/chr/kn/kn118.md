### *Colophon*

   In the Arabic text it is said: "We have turned \[this book\] into
Arabic from a Coptic manuscript \[belonging to\] the throne of <span
class="small">MARK</span> the Evangelist, the teacher, the Father of us
all. We have translated it in the four hundred and ninth year of mercy
in the country of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>, in the days of
<span class="small">GABRA MASḲAL</span> the king, who is called <span
class="small">LÂLÎBALÂ</span>, in the days of Abbâ <span
class="small">GEORGE</span>, the good bishop. And God neglected to have
it translated and interpreted into the speech of <span
class="small">ABYSSINIA</span>. And when I had pondered this—Why did not
<span class="small">’ABAL‛EZ</span> and <span
class="small">ABALFAROG</span> who edited (*or*, copied) the book
translate it? I said this: It went out in the days of <span
class="small">ZÂGUÂ</span>, and they did not translate it because this
book says: Those who reign not being <span
class="small">ISRAELITES</span> are transgressors of the Law. Had they
been of the kingdom of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span> they would have
edited (*or*, translated) it. And it was found in <span
class="small">NÂZRÊT</span>."

   "And pray ye for me, your servant <span class="small">ISAAC</span>
the poor man. And chide ye me not because of the incorrectness of the
speech of the tongue. For I have toiled much for the glory of the
country of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>, and for the going forth
of the heavenly <span class="small">ZION</span>, and for the glory of
the King of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>. And I consulted the
upright and God-loving governor <span class="small">YÂ‛EBÎKA
’EGZÎ’Ĕ</span>, and he approved and said unto me, 'Work.' And I worked,
God helping me, and He did not requite me according to my sins. And pray
ye for your servant <span class="small">ISAAC</span>, and for those
<span id="page_229">p. 229</span> who toiled with me in the going out
(i.e., production) of this book, for we were in sore tribulation, I, and
<span class="small">YAMHARANA-’AB</span>, and <span
class="small">ḤEZBA-KRESTÔS</span>, and <span
class="small">ANDREW</span>, and <span class="small">PHILIP</span>, and
<span class="small">MAḤÂRÎ-’AB</span>. May God have mercy upon them, and
may He write their names in the Book of Life in the kingdom of heaven,
with those of all the saints and martyrs for ever and ever! Amen."
