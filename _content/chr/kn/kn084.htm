<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> returned to his country with great joy and gladness; and marching along with their songs, and their pipes, and their wagons, like an army of heavenly beings, the <SMALL>ETHIOPIANS</SMALL> arrived from

<SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> at the city of <SMALL>WA&#7730;&Ecirc;R&Ocirc;M</SMALL> in a single day. And they sent messengers in ships to announce [their arrival] to <SMALL>M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL>, the Queen of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, and to report to her how they had found every good thing, and how her son had become king, and how they had brought the heavenly <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>. And she caused all this glorious news to be spread abroad, and she made a herald to go round about in all the country that was subject unto her, ordering the people to meet her son and more particularly the heavenly <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, the Tabernacle of the God of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>. And they blew horns before her, and all the people of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> rejoiced, from the least to the greatest, men as well as women; and the soldiers rose up with her to meet their King. And she came to the city of the Government, which is the chief city of the kingdom of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>; now in later times this [city] became the chief city of the Christians of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>. And in it she caused to be prepared perfumes innumerable from <SMALL>INDIA</SMALL>, and from <SMALL>B&Acirc;LT&Ecirc;</SMALL> to <SMALL>G&Acirc;LT&Ecirc;T</SMALL>, and from <SMALL>&#8217;ALS&Acirc;FU</SMALL> to <SMALL>&#8217;AZAZAT</SMALL>, and had them brought together there. And her son came by the <SMALL>&#8217;AZY&Acirc;B&Acirc;</SMALL> road to <SMALL>WA&#7730;&Ecirc;R&Ocirc;M</SMALL>, and he came forth to <SMALL>MASAS</SMALL>, and ascended to <SMALL>B&Ucirc;R</SMALL>, and arrived at the city of the Government, the capital [city] of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, which the Queen herself had built and called "<SMALL>DABRA M&Acirc;K&#276;D&Acirc;</SMALL>", after her own name.</P>
