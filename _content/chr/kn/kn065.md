### 65. *Concerning the sin of* <span class="small">SOLOMON</span>

   Now <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> sinned an exceedingly great
sin through the worship of idols, and from being a wise man he became a
fool, and his sin is written down in the Book of the Prophets. And the
Archbishops who were there answered and said, "Hath God had mercy on
<span class="small">SOLOMON</span> for this error which is written down
\[as\] his sin?" Yea, God hath had mercy upon him, and his name is
numbered with \[the names of\] <span class="small">ABRAHAM</span>, <span
class="small">ISAAC</span>, and <span class="small">JACOB</span>, and
<span class="small">DAVID</span> his father in the Book of Life in
heaven. For God is a forgiver of those who have sinned. Come now, and
consider, which was the greater of the two, the sin of his father <span
class="small">DAVID</span> or the sin of his son <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span>? <span class="small">DAVID</span> caused
<span class="small">URIAH</span> to be slain in battle by means of a
plan of deceit so that he might take his wife <span
class="small">BÊRSÂBÊḤ</span> (<span class="small">BATHSHEBA</span>),
the mother of <span class="small">SOLOMON</span>; and he repented, and
God had compassion on him. And when he was dying he advised his son
<span class="small">SOLOMON</span>, saying, "Kill <span
class="small">JOAB</span> as he killed <span class="small">’AMÊR</span>
(<span class="small">ABNER</span>), and kill <span
class="small">SHIMEI</span> because he cursed me";<span
id="page_104_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_104_note_1) and he performed the
will of his father and slew them after the death of <span
class="small">DAVID</span> his father. And <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span> killed no one except his brother when he
wished to marry the <span id="page_105">p. 105</span> Samênâwît,<span
id="page_105_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_105_note_1) the wife of his father
<span class="small">DAVID</span> whose name was <span
class="small">’ABÎS</span> (<span class="small">ABISHAG</span>). And as
concerning the error of <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> which is
written down I will reveal it to you, even as God hath revealed it to
me.
