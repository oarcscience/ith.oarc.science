### 21. *Concerning the Queen of the South*

   And how this Queen was born I have discovered written in that
manuscript, and in this manner also doth the Evangelist mention that
woman. And our Lord <span class="small">JESUS CHRIST</span>, in
condemning the Jewish people, the crucifiers, who lived at that time,
spake, saying: "The Queen of the South shall rise up on the Day of
Judgment and shall dispute with, and condemn, and overcome this
generation who would not hearken unto <span id="page_17">p. 17</span>
the preaching of My word, for she came from the ends of the earth to
hear the wisdom of <span class="small">SOLOMON</span>."<span
id="page_17_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_17_note_1) And the Queen of the
South of whom He spake was the Queen of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>. And in the words "ends of the earth" \[He
maketh allusion\] to the delicacy of the constitution of women, and the
long distance of the journey, and the burning heat of the sun, and the
hunger on the way, and the thirst for water. And this Queen of the South
was very beautiful in face, and her stature was superb, and her
understanding and intelligence, which God had given her, were of such
high character that she went to <span class="small">JERUSALEM</span> to
hear the wisdom of <span class="small">SOLOMON</span>; now this was done
by the command of God and it was His good pleasure. And moreover, she
was exceedingly rich, for God had given her glory, and riches, and gold,
and silver, and splendid apparel, and camels, and slaves, and trading
men (or, merchants). And they carried on her business and trafficked for
her by sea and by land, and in <span class="small">INDIA</span>, and in
<span class="small">’ASWÂN</span> (<span class="small">SYENE</span>).
