### 18. *How the Orthodox Fathers and Bishops Agreed*

   And again the Council of the Three Hundred and Eighteen answered and
said, "Amen. This is the salvation of the children of <span
class="small">ADAM</span>. For since the Tabernacle of the Law of God
hath come down, they shall be called, 'Men of the house of God', even as
<span class="small">DAVID</span> saith, 'And His habitation is in <span
class="small">ZION</span>.'<span id="page_15_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_15_note_1) And again he saith by the
mouth of the Holy Ghost, 'And My habitation is here, for I have chosen
it. And I will bless her priests, and I will make her poor to be glad.
And unto <span class="small">DAVID</span> <span id="page_16">p.
16</span> will I give seed in her, and upon the earth one who shall
become king, and moreover, in the heavens one from his seed shall reign
in the flesh upon the throne of the Godhead. And as for his enemies they
shall be gathered together under his footstool, and they shall be sealed
with his seal.'"
