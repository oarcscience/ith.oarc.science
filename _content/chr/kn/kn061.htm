<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> came back to the city of <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, and he wept there with the elders of <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> a great weeping in the house of God. And after this the King and <SMALL>ZADOK</SMALL> the priest embraced each other, and they wept bitterly in the habitation of <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, and they remained silent for a long time. And the elders rose up and spake unto the King, saying, "Be not thou sorrowful concerning this thing, O our Lord, for we know, from first to last, that without the Will of God <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> will not dwell [in any place], and that nothing happeneth without the Will of God. And as concerning <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> in olden time, in the days of <SMALL>ELI</SMALL> the priest, before our



<A NAME="page_96"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 96</FONT></A>

fathers had asked for a king, the <SMALL>PHILISTINES</SMALL> carried <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> away captive into [their] camp&#8212;God having neglected <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> in the battle, and its priests <SMALL>&#8217;AFN&Icirc;</SMALL> (<SMALL>HOPHNI</SMALL>) and <SMALL>P&Icirc;N&Acirc;&#7716;AS</SMALL> (<SMALL>PHINEHAS</SMALL>) having fallen by the edge of the sword. And the <SMALL>PHILISTINES</SMALL> carried away the Tabernacle of the Law of God, and brought it into their city, and set it in the house of their god <SMALL>DAGON</SMALL>. And <SMALL>DAGON</SMALL> was broken to pieces and destroyed, and became like dust, and their land became a desert through mice, and they ate up all the fruit of their land, and their persons became sores and boils. And they gathered together their priests, and magicians, and star-gazers, and they entreated them and said unto them, 'How can we relieve ourselves of these sores and the tribulation which have come upon us, and upon our country?' And those magicians meditated and withdrew themselves to be alone, and they brought their magical instruments, and pondered, and considered, and planned how they could relieve them from tribulation of their city and their persons. And they discovered that this punishment had come upon them and their city because of <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>. And they went to their kings and their governors, and they said unto them, 'All these things have befallen you through the heavenly <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, the Tabernacle of the Law of God. And now, know ye how ye will take her back into her city, and her country, and her house. And we must by no means send her away empty, but must give her an offering, so that she may forgive you your sins, and do away your tribulation when she hath returned to her city. And if ye will not send her to her city, no good will come of making her to live with you, but ye shall continue to be punished until ye are destroyed.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And their kings and governors said unto their priests, 'What gift now say ye that we ought to give her, and how shall we send her back? Find out, and tell us what we must do.' And the priests of the <SMALL>PHILISTINES</SMALL> took counsel together again, and they said unto their kings and



<A NAME="page_97"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 97</FONT></A>

governors, 'Make for her according to the heads of your houses, sixty figures of mice in gold, since mice have destroyed your land, and sixty figures of the member of a man, since your own persons have suffered from sores and boils on your members.'<A NAME="page_97_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_97_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> And the <SMALL>PHILISTINES</SMALL> made as they commanded them one hundred and twenty offerings of gold, and gave them to <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>. And again they said unto the priests, 'How shall we send her away? And whom do ye say shall set her in her city?' And again the magicians of the <SMALL>PHILISTINES</SMALL> said unto them, 'Let them bring two she-camels<A NAME="page_97_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_97_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> that brought forth their firstborn at the same time, and let them attach a wagon<A NAME="page_97_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_97_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> to them&#8212;and they must keep back their young ones and shut them up in the house&#8212;and they must yoke the two she-camels together, and then set them free and let them go where they will. And if they march straight for <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> we shall know that peradventure God hath had compassion on our land; but if they wander about, and go hither and thither, and wish to turn back to the place whence they started, then we shall know that God is [still] wroth with us, and that He will not remove His punishment until He hath blotted out ourselves and our city.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the <SMALL>PHILISTINES</SMALL> did as the priests commanded their governors, and they sent away <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, and prostrated themselves before her. And those camels made their way straight to the country of <SMALL>JUDAH</SMALL>, and they came to the threshing floor and the house of thy kinsfolk received them. And those who did not receive them were the men of the house of <SMALL>D&Acirc;N</SMALL>, and they did not do homage to <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, for they regarded her in anger as their destroyed (?) God. And they cut up the pieces of wood of the wagon, and they made those camels to be sacrifices, and <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> returned to her place. And whilst <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> was in [her] house <SMALL>SAMUEL</SMALL> the Prophet ministered



<A NAME="page_98"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 98</FONT></A>

unto her, and vision and prophecy were revealed unto him, and he pleased God in all his actions, and he ruled <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> for forty-eight years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And after him our people entreated God to give them a king like the nations that were round about them. And <SMALL>SAMUEL</SMALL> the Prophet anointed <SMALL>SAUL</SMALL> king, and he reigned forty years. And he was of the tribe of <SMALL>BENJAMIN</SMALL>, which was the youngest branch of the peoples of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>. And <SMALL>SAMUEL</SMALL> the Prophet also anointed thy father <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>. And when the <SMALL>PHILISTINES</SMALL> fought with <SMALL>SAUL</SMALL> the King, <SMALL>SAUL</SMALL> was conquered and died with [<SMALL>Y&Ocirc;</SMALL>]<SMALL>N&Acirc;TH&Acirc;N</SMALL> his son. And those of his sons who were left wished to carry away <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, when they knew that their father and their brother were dead. And then when they wished to hide her and to transfer her to the Valley of <SMALL>G&Ecirc;L&Acirc;B&Ucirc;&#7716;&Ecirc;</SMALL> (<SMALL>GILBOA</SMALL>) in order that thy father <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> might not carry them off, she would not let them carry her away until thy father came and carried her away from their city, but not with offerings, and not with incense and burnt offerings. For it was impossible to carry <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> away unless she wished it and God wished it. And again, when thy father reigned rightly over <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> he took her from the city of <SMALL>SAMARIA</SMALL> and brought her here to <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, dancing on his feet before her, and clapping his hands because of joy for her; for she was taken by him that she might come to the city of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> thy father. And as for that which thou sayest concerning the going of <SMALL>ZION</SMALL> to their city, to the country of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, if God willed it and she herself willed it, there is no one who could prevent her; for of her own will she went, and of her own will she will return if God pleaseth. And if she doth not return it will be God's good pleasure. And as for us, if God hath willed it <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> shall remain to us wherein thou hast built for us a house of God. And now, let not thine heart be sad, but comfort thou thyself with what we have said unto thee. And the wisdom, which the Lord God of



<A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A>

<SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> hath given thee, hath sprouted from thee. For wisdom is a strange thing. As a lamp is not the sun, and as vinegar and aloes are neither profitable nor useful additions to honey, even so the words of fools are not beneficial to the wise man. And as smoke is to the eye, and unripe fruit to the tooth, even so the words of fools are not beneficial to the wise."</P>
