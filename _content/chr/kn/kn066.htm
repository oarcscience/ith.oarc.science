<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, according to the interpretation of prophecy, the name <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> signifieth in the secret speech "<SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>". And as <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> built the house of God, so <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> raised up His Body and made it into the Church. And when He said unto the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL>, "Throw down this house, and in three days I will build it up [again],"<A NAME="page_105_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_105_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> He spake to them of the house of His Body. And as <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> multiplied wives from alien peoples because of their beauty and winsomeness, and desires [arose] in him in his feigning love [for them], so <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> gathered together from alien peoples those who had not the Law, but who believed on Him. And there was no uncircumcised man to Him, and no pagan; and there was no slave, and no <SMALL>JEW</SMALL>, and no servant and no free man;<A NAME="page_105_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_105_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> but He gathered them all into His heavenly kingdom by His Flesh and Blood. And in the Song of Songs <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> himself sang and said, "There are sixty mighty men round about the bed of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, all of them trained in war and holding swords, each man with his sword upon his thigh."<A NAME="page_105_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_105_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A> The number sixty indicateth the number of the righteous Patriarchs, and the Prophets, and the Apostles, and the Martyrs, and the Believers, and the Saints, and the Monks who have resisted the evil thought and the war of <SMALL>SATAN</SMALL>. And the word "sword" is, being interpreted, the word of the Scriptures. The word of the Lord cutteth like a straight sharp razor, and in like manner the Scriptures cut from men's hearts the danger caused by lying dreams by

night. And the words "bed of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>" are, being interpreted, the Church of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> sang, saying, "King <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> hath made a litter for himself,"<A NAME="page_106_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_106_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> and these words are to be interpreted that <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> hath put on our body. The name <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> in the language of the <SMALL>HEBREWS</SMALL> is, being interpreted, "<SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>". And the foolish <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> imagine that the words of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL>, "The Lord said unto me, 'Thou art my son and I this day have begotten thee,'"<A NAME="page_106_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_106_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> were spoken concerning <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> his son. "O God, give Thy judgment to the king, and Thy righteousness to the son of the king, so that he may judge thy people with righteousness and thy needy ones with justice. And he shall live and they shall give him of the gold of <SMALL>ARABIA</SMALL>, and shall pray for him continually, and shall follow him [with good words], and he shall be a support for the whole earth on the tops of the mountains, and his fruit shall be greater than the cedar, and he shall flourish in the city like the grass of the earth, and his name shall be blessed for ever, and his name shall be before the sun. I have brought thee forth from the belly before the Morning Star. God hath sworn, and He will not repent, thou art His priest for ever, after the appointment of <SMALL>MELCHIZEDEK</SMALL>."<A NAME="page_106_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_106_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And concerning this prophecy and others like thereunto, which <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> prophesied concerning <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>, the foolish <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL>, who are blind of heart, say that what <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> said in the beginning of his book was spoken concerning his son <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>; this do the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> say, and they make <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> to be <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> because of the similarity of name, and the wisdom, and because He was the Son of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> in the flesh. And although those who came after <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> and <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, namely <SMALL>ELIJAH</SMALL> and <SMALL>ELISHA</SMALL>, knew this, they ascribed <SMALL>SOLOMON'S</SMALL> sin to him in the Book of <SMALL>KINGS</SMALL> in order that they might put to



<A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A>

shame the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL>, who are blinded in heart and the enemies of righteousness. And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> the King, the son of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> the King and Prophet, was himself also King and Prophet, and he prophesied many similitudes concerning <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> and concerning the Church, and he wrote four books of prophecy, and is numbered with <SMALL>ABRAHAM</SMALL>, <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL>, and <SMALL>JACOB</SMALL>, and <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> his father in the kingdom of the heavens.</P>
