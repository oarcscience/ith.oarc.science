<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> sinned an exceedingly great sin through the worship of idols, and from being a wise man he became a fool, and his sin is written down in the Book of the Prophets. And the Archbishops who were there answered and said, "Hath God had mercy on <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> for this error which is written down [as] his sin?" Yea, God hath had mercy upon him, and his name is numbered with [the names of] <SMALL>ABRAHAM</SMALL>, <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL>, and <SMALL>JACOB</SMALL>, and <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> his father in the Book of Life in heaven. For God is a forgiver of those who have sinned. Come now, and consider, which was the greater of the two, the sin of his father <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> or the sin of his son <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>? <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> caused <SMALL>URIAH</SMALL> to be slain in battle by means of a plan of deceit so that he might take his wife <SMALL>B&Ecirc;RS&Acirc;B&Ecirc;&#7716;</SMALL> (<SMALL>BATHSHEBA</SMALL>), the mother of <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>; and he repented, and God had compassion on him. And when he was dying he advised his son <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, saying, "Kill <SMALL>JOAB</SMALL> as he killed <SMALL>&#8217;AM&Ecirc;R</SMALL> (<SMALL>ABNER</SMALL>), and kill <SMALL>SHIMEI</SMALL> because he cursed me";<A NAME="page_104_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_104_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> and he performed the will of his father and slew them after the death of <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> his father. And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> killed no one except his brother when he wished to marry the
