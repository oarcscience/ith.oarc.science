<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="1">"And the '<b>SIXTH ANGEL</b>' sounded, and I heard a voice from the 'Four Horns' of the 'Golden Altar' which is before God, saying to the '<b>SIXTH ANGEL</b>' which had the Trumpet, Loose the '<b>Four Angels</b>' which are bound in the great river Euphrates, and the '<b>Four Angels</b>' were loosed, which were prepared for an <b>hour</b>, and a <b>day</b>, and a <b>month</b>, and a <b>year</b>, for to slay the <b>third part of men</b>. And the number of the army of the horsemen were <b>two hundred thousand&nbsp;thousand</b>: and I heard the number of them. And thus I saw the horses in the Vision, and them that sat on them, having <b>breastplates of fire</b>, and of <b>jacinth</b>, and <b>brimstone</b>: and the <b>heads</b> of the horses were as the <b>heads of lions</b>: and out of their <b>mouth</b> issued <b>fire and smoke and brimstone</b>. By these three was the third part of men killed, by the <b>fire</b>, and by the <b>smoke</b>, and by the <b>brimstone</b>, which issued out of their mouths. For their power is in their <b>mouth</b>, and in their <b>tails</b>: for their <b>tails</b> were like unto <b>serpents</b>, and had <b>heads</b>, and with them do hurt. And the rest of the men which were not killed by these Plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship <b>devils</b> (demons), and <b>idols of gold</b>, and <b>silver</b>, and <b>brass</b>, and <b>stone</b>, and of <b>wood</b>; which neither can <b>see</b>, or <b>hear</b>, nor <b>walk</b>: neither repented they of their <b>murders</b>, nor of their <b>sorceries</b>, nor of their <b>fornication</b>, nor of their <b>thefts</b>."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>That these "<b>Four Angels</b>," who were bound at the river Euphrates, were <b>bad angels</b> is seen from the fact that they were <b>bound</b>, and that they are the leaders or commanders of an army of <b>200,000,000</b> "<b>INFERNAL CAVALRY</b>." This army of 200,000,000 horse-men is a <b>supernatural army</b>. It is not composed of ordinary men and horses. The fact that these "Four Angels" were bound at the Euphrates, where Satan's seat was in ancient times, and where it is to be again in the City of Babylon restored, and from whence he sallied forth to do his diabolical work, makes it clear that this army is a part of Satan's forces. Supernatural armies are not unknown to the Scriptures. Horses and a <b>chariot of fire</b> separated Elijah from</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Elisha in the day when Elijah was taken up by a <b>whirlwind</b> into Heaven, 2. Kings 2:11. When Dothan was besieged by the army of Syria, God opened the eyes of Elisha's servant, and he saw the mountains around the city full of horses and <b>chariots of fire</b>. 2. Kings 6:13-17. When the Lord Jesus Christ shall come to take "The Kingdom," He will be attended by the "Armies of Heaven" riding on "White Horses," and it stands to reason, if there is to be "War in Heaven" between Michael and his angels, and Satan and his angels (Rev. 12:7), that Satan has his armies, and among them <b>horsemen</b>, and that the 200,000,000 Horsemen mentioned here are Satan's Horse-men, for no such army of <b>ordinary horsemen</b> ever was, or ever could be, assembled on this earth.</p>  
<p>Again the horses were not ordinary horses, for while their <b>bodies</b> were like the body of a <b>HORSE</b>, their <b>heads</b> were as the head of a <b>LION</b>, and their tails were like unto a <b>SERPENT</b>, the end of which had the <b>HEAD OF A SERPENT</b>, and it was the <b>SULPHUROUS SMOKE AND FIRE</b> that <b>issued from their mouths</b>, and the <b>SERPENT STING</b> of their <b>tails</b>, that killed all that crossed their path, that reveals the Satanic character of the horses and their riders. The "Riders" upon these horses had "Breastplates of <b>FIRE</b>, <b>JACINTH</b>, and <b>BRIMSTONE</b>," to match the <b>breath</b> of the horses upon which they rode.</p>  
<p>The wonderful thing about this invasion of "<b>INFERNAL CAVALRY</b>" was the awful destruction they wrought. They slew the <b>THIRD PART OF MEN</b>. If that means of the <b>whole world</b>, and the present population of the earth is 1,700,000,000, then this army will destroy 566,666,666 persons. It probably however refers to one-third of the men of the old Roman world. Another remarkable thing is, that the "Four Angels" were prepared for <b>THE</b> (R. V.) <b>HOUR</b>, <b>MONTH</b>, and <b>YEAR</b>, that is, they were waiting for the <b>EXACT year</b>, <b>month</b>, <b>day</b>, and even <b>hour</b>, known only to God, on which to make the invasion, and not, as some think, to slay for <b>a year, month and day</b>, or 391 days. "Known unto God are all His works from the beginning of the world." Acts 15:18. This Plague of "<b>INFERNAL CAVALRY</b>" was for a twofold purpose, retribution and reformation. To punish the <b>idolatry</b> and <b>demon worship</b> of men, and their sins of <b>murder</b>, <b>sorcery</b>, <b>fornication</b>, and <b>theft</b>, and to keep others from following in their footsteps. But it appears from verses 20 and 21, that the residue of men who were not killed, did not repent and turn from their sins, and so were left for later judgments.</p>  
<p>This army of "<b>INFERNAL CAVALRY</b>," being composed of "<b>SPIRIT BEINGS</b>" like the "<b>SCORPION LOCUSTS</b>," will like them be invisible to the natural eye, and therefore cannot be resisted, or warred against, by carnal weapons. Those attacked will therefore be without any means of protection, and this will account for the awful destruction of human life, for the "<b>third part</b>" of man will be killed. The awful destructive judgments of the "Trumpets" and "Vials" that are to come upon the earth are doubtless for the purpose of weeding out the worst of the human race, so that only the better class of men shall be saved for the millennium.</p>
