<p>What is this "<b>SEVEN SEALED BOOK</b>"? Writing to the Ephesians (Eph. 1:13-14), Paul said--"Ye were <b>SEALED</b> with the Holy Spirit of promise, which is the <b>earnest</b> of our inheritance until the <b>REDEMPTION</b> of the <b>PURCHASED POSSESSION</b>." Then there is a <b>POSSESSION</b> that is to be <b>REDEEMED</b>. What this is, Paul tells us in Rom. 8:22-23. "We know that the <b>WHOLE CREATION GROANETH AND TRAVAILETH IN PAIN TOGETHER UNTIL NOW</b>. And not only they (all earthly created things), but ourselves also, which have the "First fruits of the Spirit," even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the <b>adoption</b>, to wit, the <b>REDEMPTION OF, OUR BODY</b>." (This will take place at the First Resurrection).</p>  
<p>We see from these references that there is something that was lost to mankind and the earth that is to be redeemed, and we do not have to go far to find out what it was. It is the inheritance of the <b>earth</b> and of <b>immortal life</b> given to Adam and Eve, and that was lost in the Fall of Eden. When Adam sinned he lost his inheritance of the earth, and it passed out of his hands into the possession of Satan, to the disinheritance of all of Adam's seed. The forfeited Title Deed is now in God's hands and is awaiting redemption. Its redemption means the <b>legal repossession</b> of all that Adam lost by the Fall. Adam was impotent to redeem the lost possession, but the law provides (Lev. 25:23-34) that a <b>kinsman</b> may redeem a lost possession. That <b>KINSMAN</b> has been provided in the person of <b>JESUS CHRIST</b>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_45"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 45</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> To become a <b>kinsman</b> He had to be born into the human race. This the Virgin Birth accomplished. Jesus paid the <b>REDEMPTIVE PRICE</b>, which was His own <b>BLOOD</b>, on the Cross (1. Pet. 1:18-20), but He has not as yet claimed that which He then purchased. When the time comes for the <b>Redemption</b> of the <b>PURCHASED POSSESSION</b> Jesus will do so. That time and the act is described in the scripture we are now considering. The "<b>SEVEN SEALED BOOK</b>" is the "<b>TITLE DEED</b>" to the redeemed inheritance. In Old Testament days when a kinsman desired to redeem a property he took his position, with ten men (Elders) as witnesses, in the gate of the city and advertised his purpose. This is beautifully illustrated in the story of Boaz and Ruth. Ruth 4:1-12. The kinsman who redeemed the property was called the "Goel" or <b>REDEEMER</b>.</p>  
<p>When the "strong angel" proclaimed with a loud voice--"<b>WHO</b> is worthy to open the Book, and to loose the <b>Seals</b> thereof?" that was the <b>advertisement</b> for the "<b>KINSMAN REDEEMER</b>" to appear. But, said John, there was no <b>MAN</b> (redeemed man) in Heaven; nor in Earth, neither under the Earth, who was able to open the Book, neither to look thereon. It was not a question of the worthiness of some angelic being, as Michael or Gabriel, to open the Book, but of a <b>MAN</b>. When John saw that there was no one worthy to open the Book he wept. Some say he wept because he was disappointed that he could not satisfy his curiosity as to the contents of the Book, but such a statement is puerile. A man under the influence of the Holy Spirit would not be so foolish. John wept because he knew what the Book was, and that if there was no one to open that "<b>BOOK OF REDEMPTION</b>," that all hope of the redemption of the earth and of man was gone. But John's sorrow was of short duration, for one of the Elders said--"Weep not: behold, the <b>LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH</b>, the <b>ROOT OF DAVID</b>, hath prevailed to open the Book, and to loose the 'Seven Seals' thereof." And John saw, what he had not noticed before a <b>LAMB, as it had been slain</b>, standing in the midst of the Throne, and of the "Four Living Creatures." John had not seen the Lamb before, because it (He) had been seated on the Throne with the Father, and advanced out of the Glory of the Throne as the Elder spoke.</p>  
<p>John looked for a "<b>Lion</b>" and saw a <b>LAMB</b>. But the Elder was right in calling it a "<b>Lion</b>," for Jesus was about to assume His Title as the <b>LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH</b>, and reign and rule with <b>KINGLY POWER</b>. That the Lamb was not an animal is clear from verse seven, where it says--"And <b>HE</b> (the Lamb) came and took the Book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the Throne." This is the sublimest individual act recorded in the Scriptures. On it the redemption of the whole creation of God depends. It is still future and takes place after the Church has been "caught out" and Judged, and before the Tribulation Period begins, and you and I, if we are redeemed by the Blood of the Lamb, will witness the scene, and take part in the "Song of Redemption" that follows. Rev. 5:8-10.</p>

<p>This is the "<b>DUE TIME</b>," when the "<b>MAN</b>" <b>CHRIST JESUS</b>, who gave Himself as a "<b>RANSOM</b>" (on the Cross) for the redemption of the lost inheritance, will be <b>TESTIFIED TO</b> before the Throne of God, by redeemed mankind, angels, and every creature in Heaven and Earth, and under the Earth. 1. Tim. 2:5-6; Rev. 5:8-14.</p>  
<p>When the Lamb leaves the Throne to take the Book, His Mediatorial Work ceases, and His <b>REDEMPTIVE WORK</b> begins. When our "<b>KINSMAN REDEEMER</b>" is handed the "<b>Book</b>," the "<b>TITLE DEED</b>" to the "Purchased Possession," He has the right to break its <b>SEALS</b>, and claim the "<b>Inheritance</b>," and <b>DISPOSSESS</b> the present claimant <b>SATAN</b>. This He will immediately proceed to do, as He breaks the <b>SEALS</b>. Satan is not evicted at once. He contests the claim and it is only after a prolonged conflict that he is finally dispossessed and cast into the Lake of Fire.</p>  
<p>In the Gospels four titles are given to Jesus. He is the Son of David; the Son of Abraham; the Son of Man; and the Son of God.</p>  
<p>1. As the Son of David, He has title to the Throne of David.</p>  
<p>2. As the Son of Abraham, He has title to the Land of Palestine, and all included in the Royal Grant to Abraham. See Map of The Royal Grant.</p>  
<p>3. As the Son of Man, He has title to the Earth and the World.</p>  
<p>4. As the Son of God, He is the Heir of All Things.</p>  
<p>The manner of redemption of a lost inheritance is beautifully set forth in the Old Testament. A property could not be alienated from the original owner or his heirs for a longer period than 50 years, at which time it reverted to the original owner. If however for some reason the owner was forced to sell it, it could be redeemed by the next of kin on the payment of the proportionate amount of its value due until the next "Year of Jubilee." Lev. 25:8-17. Two illustrations of this method of redeeming a forfeited possession are given in the Old Testament; one in Ruth 4:1-12, where Boaz redeems the possession of Elimelech, the other in Jer. 32:6-12, where the Prophet Jeremiah purchased the possession of his cousin Hanameel. The "Deed" was written on a parchment roll, and when the inside was filled, the outside was used, but enough space was left to not show the writing when the parchment was rolled up and sealed, and on the outside of the roll that showed, the Title of the Deed, and the names</p>

<p>of the subscribing witnesses were written. Two copies of the "Deed" were made. One was sealed, and the other left unsealed for the purpose of reference. These deeds were handed to the purchaser in the presence of witnesses, and either kept by him, or intrusted to a custodian, or placed, as in the case of Jeremiah, in an earthen vessel, that would neither rot nor rust, to be preserved until the end of the Seventy Years of Captivity that the Prophet had foretold was to be. This method of taking title, explains the meaning and purpose of the "Seven Sealed Book" that John saw written <b>within</b> and on the <b>back</b>. The "Seals" were not in a row along the edge of the Book or Roll, but a Seal was broken and the parchment unrolled until the next seal was reached, and so on until all the "<b>Seals</b>" had been broken. We are not told that what happened as the "<b>Seals</b>" were broken was read out of the Book. The contents of the "Book" are not disclosed. We are simply told, as the "<b>Seals</b>" are broken, that certain things happened. They doubtless were preliminary to the Lamb's taking possession of the Purchased Possession. It is not until chapter 10:1-6, that Christ, as the "<b>MIGHTY ANGEL</b>," puts His right foot upon the sea, and His left foot on the earth, and cries--"There shall be time no longer," that is "<b>NO LONGER DELAY</b>," that He takes formal possession, but as the claim is disputed further steps, as we shall see, are necessary to secure possession.</p>
