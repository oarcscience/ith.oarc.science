</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">7. THE NEW THRONE.</h3>  
<p align="center">Rev. 22:3-4.</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="1">"And there shall be no more curse: but the <b>THRONE OF GOD AND OF THE LAMB</b> shall be in it; and His servants shall serve Him: and they shall see His <b>FACE</b>: and His <b>NAME</b> shall be in their <b>foreheads</b>."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Whoever heard of an earthly city without some place of worship, be it heathen or Christian, but the wonderful thing about the New Jerusalem is, that it has no <b>Temple</b>. Why need a Temple when the object of worship is present, for "<b>The Lord God Almighty and the Lamb Are the Temple of It</b>." In fact the whole City itself will be a Temple.</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="1">"Then the '<b>Tabernacle of God</b>' shall be with men, and He will <b>dwell with them</b>, and they shall be His People, and God Himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be <b>no more death</b>, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the <b>FORMER THINGS ARE PASSED AWAY</b>." Rev. 21:3, 4.</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>This means that Heaven shall have come down to Earth, and that this earth will become the <b>RESIDENCE OF GOD</b>.</p>
