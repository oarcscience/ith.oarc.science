### FOURTH TRUMPET.

### (SUN, Moon and Stars Smitten.)

Rev. 8:12.

"And the '**FOURTH ANGEL**' sounded, and the **third part of the SUN was
smitten**, and the **third part of the MOON**, and the **third part of
the STARS**; so as the **third part** of them was **DARKENED**, and the
day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise."

What happens under the sounding of this "Trumpet" is so similar to what
happened under the "Sixth Seal" that it is not necessary to further
dwell on it here. These are some of the "Signs" spoken of by Christ, in
Luke's Gospel, that shall precede His Second Coming. There shall be
signs in the **SUN**, and in the **MOON**, and in the **STARS**, and
upon the earth distress of nations, with **PERPLEXITY**." Luke 21:25-28.
