<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="1">"And I saw when the <b>LAMB</b> opened one of the <b>SEALS</b>, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the 'Four Beasts' saying, <b>Come and see</b>. And I saw, and behold a <b>WHITE HORSE</b>: and he that sat on him had a <b>bow</b>; and a <b>crown was given unto him</b>: and he went forth <b>conquering</b>, and <b>to conquer</b>."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>When the <b>LAMB</b> broke the "First Seal," the first, or "Lion-like Living Creature" cried with a voice of thunder--"<b>COME</b>." The words "and see" are omitted in many manuscripts, and in the Revised Version. John had no need to "come" for he was already there. The command then of "Come" was to the "<b>Rider</b>" of the White Horse. When he appeared, John says--"And I saw, and behold a <b>WHITE HORSE</b>; and he that sat on him had a <b>bow</b>; and a <b>crown was given unto him</b>: and he went forth <b>conquering</b>, and <b>to conquer</b>."</p>  
<p>Who is the "<b>Rider</b>" upon this White Horse? He is not Christ, as some claim, for Christ, as the <b>LAMB</b>, is holding the "Seven Sealed Book" and breaking its "Seals." Christ does not appear as a White Horse Rider until chapter 19:11-16, when He comes with the armies of Heaven to engage in the Battle of Armageddon. Then He is called "Faithful and True," and on His head there is a many "Diademed Crown," and He is clothed in a vesture dipped in blood, and His name is called the "<b>WORD OF GOD</b>," and there is no weapon of warfare in His hand, but a <b>sharp sword</b> comes out of His <b>mouth</b>, and the effect upon His enemies will he swift and terrible.</p>  
<p>This "Rider" has a "<b>bow</b>," no arrow is mentioned, and he is not crowned at first, but a crown will be given to him later, the "Stephanos" or "Victor's Crown," as a reward for his victories which are prolonged and bloodless. This is the picture of a brilliant, strategical, and irresistible conqueror, whose victories will dazzle the world, and elevate him to a leadership that will place him at the Head of the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_54"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 54</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Ten Federated Kingdoms of the revived Roman Empire. As a subaltern, like Napoleon I, he will rise from the ranks until a crown will be given him. His triumphs will be due to his skilful diplomacy. Like Antiochus Epiphanes, his prototype, he "will come in <b>peaceably</b>, and obtain the Kingdom by <b>flatteries</b>." Dan. 11:21. As the "Tool of Satan" he will be endowed with wonder working powers, and when he comes, he will find the world ready to receive him, for God will send upon its inhabitants a "<b>strong delusion</b>" that they will believe a LIE, or "<b>THE LIE</b>," for that is what he will be. 2. Thess. 2:9-11.</p>  
<p>In other words this White Horse Rider is the <b>ANTICHRIST</b>. He is the "<b>PRINCE WHO IS TO COME</b>" of Daniel's Vision of the "Seventy Weeks," and who will confirm the Covenant for "<b>ONE WEEK</b>," the last or "Seventieth Week," with Daniel's people the Jews. Dan. 9:27. This Covenant will probably be the privilege to return to Palestine and rebuild the Temple and re-establish their sacrificial form of worship, and national existence, in exchange for the financial assistance of the Jewish bankers of the world in his schemes of establishing world wide commerce, and the formation of a gigantic corporation, with its commercial centre in the rebuilt city of Babylon, so that no one can buy or sell unless they have his "<b>MARK</b>," (the "Mark of the Beast," Rev. 13:16-17), for we are told in Dan. 8:23-25, that "through his policy also he shall cause <b>CRAFT</b> (manufactories) to prosper in his hand."</p>  
<p>The rise of this White Horse Rider necessarily antedates the beginning of the "Seventieth Week," or the "<b>SEVEN YEARS</b>" of his reign, for he must have reached a position of power to make a Covenant with the Jews at the beginning of the "<b>WEEK</b>," but he does not become "<b>THE BEAST</b>," as described in chapter 13:1-8, until the "<b>Middle</b>" of the <b>WEEK</b>, that is, until after Satan is cast out of the Heavenlies and incarnates himself in him. His rise to power and the rebuilding of Babylon will take time, so the Rapture of the Church will doubtless antedate the <b>beginning</b> of the <b>WEEK</b> by some years.</p>  
<p>But while the establishment of the Antichrist's power will be comparatively peaceful, that peace will be shortlived as is evident from the breaking of the "Second Seal."</p>  
<p>This "White Horse Rider" will be Satan's "<b>SUPERMAN</b>." The Scriptures clearly teach that there is some day to arise a human being who shall be the embodiment of all Satanic power. He will be known as the "<b>WILFUL KING</b>" because he shall do according to his own will. He will be the Czar of Czars. He will have no respect for sacred things or places. He will cause a throne to be erected in the Most Holy Place of a Temple that the Jews will build at Jerusalem, and, seating himself upon it, he will proclaim himself <b>God</b>, and men will be commanded to worship him; and Satan will give unto him his <b>power</b> and his <b>seat</b> (Throne) and great authority. All this will be fully brought out under the "Sixth Personage," the "Beast Out of the Sea," Page <A HREF="tbr054.htm#page_103">103</A>.</p>
