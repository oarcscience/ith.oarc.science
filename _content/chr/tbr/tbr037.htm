<p>There is no need to spiritualize this. It means just what it says. These things have happened before why not again? It is the fulfilment of Joel 2:30-31, where the Lord says that in the "latter days" He will--"Shew wonders in the heavens' and in the earth, <b>BLOOD</b>, and <b>FIRE</b>, and <b>PILLARS OF SMOKE</b>. The sun shall be turned into <b>DARKNESS</b>, and the Moon into <b>BLOOD</b>, <b>before</b> the <b>GREAT AND THE TERRIBLE DAY OF THE LORD COME</b>." The <b>DAY</b> when He shall come to take <b>VENGEANCE ON HIS ENEMIES</b>. The Lord is going to repeat the "<b>PLAGUES OF EGYPT</b>." They were <b>literal</b>, why not the "Trumpet" and "Vial" Judgments? The <b>literalness</b> of these Judgments give us the "<b>key</b>" to the <b>LITERALNESS</b> of the Book of Revelation. No less than 5 of the 9 Plagues of Egypt are to be repeated during the Tribulation Period. This Plague is the same as the "<b>SEVENTH EGYPTIAN PLAGUE</b>." "And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be <b>HAIL</b> in all the Land of Egypt, upon <b>man</b>, and upon <b>beast</b>, and upon every <b>herb of the field</b>, throughout the Land of Egypt." And Moses stretched forth his "<b>rod</b>" toward heaven: and the Lord sent <b>THUNDER</b> and <b>HAIL</b>, and the <b>FIRE ran along upon the ground</b>; and the Lord rained <b>HAIL</b> upon the Land of Egypt. So there was <b>HAIL</b>, and <b>FIRE mingled with</b> the <b>HAIL</b>, very grievous, such as there was <b>none like it</b> in all the Land of Egypt since it became a nation. And the <b>HAIL</b> smote throughout all the Land of Egypt all that was in the <b>field</b>, both <b>man</b> and <b>beast</b>; and the <b>HAIL</b> smote every <b>herb of the field</b>, and <b>brake every tree</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>of the field. ONLY IN THE LAND OF GOSHEN, WHERE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE, WAS THERE NO HAIL</b>." Ex. 9:22-26. The difference between this Egyptian Plague, and the Plague of the First Trumpet, is, that the situation will be <b>reversed</b>. Then the "<b>CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</b>" escaped, now they will suffer. The Judgments of Egypt were directed against Pharoah, the Judgments of the Tribulation Period will be directed against Israel.</p>  
<p>The Egyptian "Plague of Hail" was clearly a great "<b>ELECTRICAL STORM</b>" that did not touch the Land of Goshen where the Children of Israel dwelt. The <b>FIRE</b> that "<b>ran along the ground</b>" was lightning. The difference between the Egyptian Plague and the one John describes is, that in Egypt <b>man</b> and <b>beast</b> suffered <b>with the vegetation</b>, while only the <b>trees</b> and the <b>green grass</b> will suffer when the First Trumpet sounds, and the <b>HAIL</b> and <b>FIRE</b> will be <b>MINGLED WITH BLOOD</b>. In Egypt the "Hail" smote <b>every herb of the field</b>, and <b>broke every tree</b>, but under the First Trumpet only <b>one-third</b> of the trees and grass will be burnt up.</p>
