<p>In the "Middle of the Week" two "<b>Wonders</b>" will appear in Heaven, for John is back again in Heaven. The Revised Version calls them "<b>SIGNS</b>," that is, they are "<b>SYMBOLS</b>" of something, and must be thus interpreted. The first will be a "<b>SUN CLOTHED WOMAN</b>." Who does this "Sun Clothed Woman" represent? Some would have us believe that this "Woman" is the Virgin Mary, others that she represents the Church. Those who say she represents the</p>

<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Church claim that she represents the <b>visible</b> or outward Church, and her "Child" represents the "True Church" or those who are to be "caught out" at the Rapture. If this be true, and the "Child" is not caught out until the "Middle of the Week," then the Church will have to go half way through the "Tribulation." The fact is, the "Woman" is neither the Virgin Mary or the Church. She is <b>ISRAEL</b>. We have only to be reminded of "<b>Joseph's Dream</b>," where he says--"Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the '<b>SUN</b>' and the <b>'MOON</b>' and the '<b>ELEVEN STARS</b>' made Obeisance to me" (Gen. 37:9), to see the Jewish character of this "Woman." Joseph was the "Twelfth" star.</p>  
<p>Israel is again and again compared to a woman, and a married woman, in the Old Testament. Isa. 54:1. And in the period of her rejection she is spoken of as a <b>WIDOW</b> (Isa. 47:7-9. Luke 18:1-8), and a <b>DIVORCED</b> Woman (Isa. 50:1), and an <b>ADULTEROUS WIFE</b> (Jer. 3:1-25, Hosea 2:1-23) but the Church is a <b>VIRGIN</b>, and an <b>ESPOUSED</b> Virgin at that. 2. Cor. 11:2. Eph. 5:25-27. The "Sun Clothed Woman" is described as being "<b>WITH CHILD</b>," and "<b>TRAVAILING TO BRING FORTH</b>." When was the Church in such a condition? To be found in such a condition would unfit her to be the Bride of Christ. Nowhere in the scriptures is it intimated that the Church is ever to be a <b>Mother</b>. But it is so prophesied of Israel. Speaking of the sevenfold privilege of Israel, Paul says--"Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the <b>adoption</b>, and the <b>glory</b>, and the <b>covenants</b>, and the <b>giving of the law</b>, and the <b>service of God</b>, and the <b>promises</b>, whose are <b>the fathers</b>, and of whom <b>AS CONCERNING THE FLESH CHRIST CAME</b>." Rom. 9:4-5. Here we see that Christ was to come from <b>ISRAEL</b>. Then we know that the "<b>PROMISED SEED</b>" was to come through <b>ISRAEL</b>, and the Prophet Isaiah looked forward to the time when Israel could say--"<b>UNTO US A CHILD IS BORN UNTO US A SON IS GIVEN</b>." Isa. 9:6-7. Before the promised heir could be born Israel had to pass through many sore afflictions and judgments. These were her "<b>TRAVAIL TIME</b>." There can be no question but what the "Sun Clothed Woman" represents <b>ISRAEL</b>.</p>
