<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Man, shall surrender the Kingdom to God, that God may be <b>ALL IN ALL</b>. 1 Cor. 15:24-28. This is known as <b>The Great Abdication</b>.</p>  
<p>There have been many abdications of thrones in the world's history, but none like this. Thrones have been abdicated for various reasons. Some have been forced, others voluntary. Some on account of physical infirmity, or to secure some particular successor. But Christ will not abdicate for any of these reasons. He will abdicate because He has <b>Finished the Work That Was Given Him to Do as the Son of Man</b>. He will not surrender His <b>Human Nature</b>, but His title "<b>Son of Man</b>" will merge back into that of "<b>Son of God</b>" so that the Divine <b>Godhead</b> shall thereafter act in its <b>Unity</b>, and God shall be "<b>ALL IN ALL</b>."</p>
