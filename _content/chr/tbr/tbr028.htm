And I heard a voice in the midst of the Four Beasts say, A <b>measure of wheat for a penny</b>, and <b>three measures of barley for a penny</b>: and see thou <b>hurt not</b> the <b>oil</b> and the <b>wine</b>."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>When the "<b>THIRD SEAL</b>" was broken John heard the third or "Man-like Living Creature" say--"<b>Come</b>," and a "<b>BLACK HORSE</b>" appeared and went forth, whose Rider held in his hand a "<b>pair of balances</b>," and John heard the voice of an invisible person in the midst of the "Four Living Creatures" say--"<b>A measure of wheat for a penny</b>, and <b>three measures of barley for a penny</b>, and see thou <b>hurt not</b> the <b>oil</b> and the <b>wine</b>." The "<b>BLACK HORSE</b>" signifies <b>famine</b>, and the Rider the "<b>Conserver of Food</b>." When all able bodied men are drafted for war, and no one left to sow and harvest the crops, then famine is sure to follow. So great will be the famine, that it will take a "denarius" a day's wages, to buy a "choenix" (2 pints) of wheat," the daily ration of a slave. What is meant by not hurting the <b>oil</b> and <b>wine</b>, may be, that as the Olive tree and grapevine do not bear their fruit until some months after the wheat and barley harvest, and grow without much attention, their crops would not be so much affected by war, and therefore the Olive trees and grapevines were not to be ruthlessly destroyed by invaders for they were needed for medicinal purposes.</p>
