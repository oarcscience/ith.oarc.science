<p><a name="xii.i-p3"></A><b>1 </b>Hear ye the word which Jehovah speaks to you, O house of Israel:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; The way of the Gentiles learn not, And of the signs of heaven be not afraid, For fear them do the Gentiles:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Because the rites of the heathens are vanity, For a tree from the forest does <i>one </i>cut &#8212; The work of the craftsman&#8217;s hands by the ax;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p6"></A><b>4 </b>With silver and gold they beautify it, With nails and hammer they make it fast, That it should not move;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p7"></A><b>5 </b>As a palm, erect, but they speak not; And being raised, they are raised, for they cannot walk: Fear them not, for they cannot do evil, And to do good is not in their power. (2:14)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p8"></A><b>6 </b>From no time has been found <i>any </i>Like thee, Jehovah; great <i>art </i>thou, And great is thy name in power.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Who should not fear thee, king of nations? For to thee this belongs; For among all the wise of the nations, And in all their kingdoms, From no time has there been <i>one</i> like thee. (2:28)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p10"></A><b>8 </b>Even in this one thing they are foolish and fatuitous &#8212; The teaching of vanities the wood is:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Silver, extended, is from Tarshish brought, And gold from Ophas, &#8212; The work of the artificer and of the melter&#8217;s hands; Hyacinth and purple <i>are </i>their garments, The work of the wise, all of them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p12"></A><b>10 </b>But Jehovah is God, the truth, God, the life and the king of ages: Through his fury tremble will the earth, And the nations will not bear his wrath.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p13"></A><b>11 </b>Thus shall ye say to them, &#8212; The gods who made not the heaven and the earth, Let them perish from the earth and from under heaven:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p14"></A><b>12 </b>He who made the earth by his power, Who set in order the world by his wisdom, And by his understanding extended the heavens, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p15"></A><b>13 </b>At his voice <i>there is </i>abundance of waters in the heavens, And he makes vapors to ascend from the extremity of the earth; Lightnings he makes for rain, And brings the wind from his treasures. (2:31)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p16"></A><b>14 </b>Foolish is every man through <i>his </i>knowledge, Ashamed is every maker of the graven image, For a falsehood is the molten image, And there is no breath in them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p17"></A><b>15 </b>Vanity they are, the work of illusions; At the time of their visitation they shall perish.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p18"></A><b>16 </b>But not like them <i>is </i>the portion of Jacob, For the Creator of all things is he, And Israel <i>is</i> the rod of his inheritance; Jehovah of hosts is his name.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p19"></A><b>17 </b>Gather from the land thy treasures Thou who dwellest in a fortress:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p20"></A><b>18 </b>For thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; Behold! will cast out <i>as </i>with a sling The inhabitants of the land at this time, And I will straiten them, That they may find <i>what they deserve.</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p21"></A><b>19 </b>Woe is me on account of my bruising! Full of pain is the smiting given to me! and I said, &#8212; Surely it is my stroke, and I will bear it:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p22"></A><b>20 </b>My tent is pulled down, And all my cords are broken; My sons are gone from me, and there are none &#8212; No one to extend any more my tent, And to set up my curtains!</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p23"></A><b>21 </b>For infatuated are the pastors, And Jehovah have they not sought; Therefore have they not prospered, And all that was in their pastures has been destroyed.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p24"></A><b>22 </b>A sound of rumor! lo, it comes, And a great tumult, from the land of the north, To make the cities of Judah a waste, The habitation of dragons!</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p25"></A><b>23 </b>I know Jehovah, That his way is not in the power of man, <i>That </i>it is not in man who walketh to guide his steps.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p26"></A><b>24 </b>Chastise me, Jehovah, but only in moderation; Not in thy wrath, lest thou shouldest consume me:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p27"></A><b>25 </b>Pour thy wrath on the nations, who know thee not, And on the families who have not called on thy name; For they have devoured Jacob, Yea, they have devoured and consumed him, And his tents have they laid waste.</p>  <a name="xii.ii"></A>

<p><a name="xii.ii-p3"></A><b>1 </b>The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Hear ye the words of this covenant; and say ye to the men</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, &#8212; Cursed</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p6"></A><b>4</b> Is the man who hears not the words of this covenant, which I commanded your fathers in the day in which I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, &#8212; Hear ye my voice, and do according to all those things which I have commanded you; and ye shall be to me a people and I will</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p7"></A><b>5</b> Be to you a God; that I may confirm the oath which I swear to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, according to what it is at this day. And I answered and said, Amen, Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>And Jehovah said to me, Proclaim these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, &#8212; Hear the words of this covenant and do them;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>For protesting I protested to your fathers, In the day in which I brought them Out of the land of Egypt, to this day, Rising up early and protesting, and saying, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>&#8220;Hear ye my voice:&#8221; Yet they heard not, nor inclined their ear, But walked, every one of them, After the wickedness of his own evil heart: I have therefore brought on them All the words of this covenant, Which I commanded them to do, But they did them not. (2:84)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>And Jehovah said to me, &#8212; Found out is a conspiracy, Among the men of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Returned are they to the iniquities of their forefathers, Who refused to hear my words, But walked after foreign gods to serve them: Broken have the house of Israel and the house of Judah My covenant, which I made with their fathers.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>Therefore thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; Behold, I will bring upon you an evil, From which ye shall not be able to escape; And they shall cry to me, but I will not hear them:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>And go shall the cities of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem, And cry to the gods to whom they have offered incense; But by saving they will not save them In the time of <i>their </i>affliction:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p15"></A><b>13 </b>For according to the number of thy cities Have been thy gods, O Judah; And according to the number of streets of Jerusalem, Have ye set up altars for reproach &#8212; Altars to offer incense to Baal. (2:94)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p16"></A><b>14 </b>And thou, pray not for this people, And raise not for them a cry and a prayer; For I will not hear them at the time When they shall cry to me for their distress.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p17"></A><b>15 </b>What has my beloved to do in mine house, While she commits abomination with many? And the flesh of the sanctuary is taken from thee; For when thou didst evil, thou didst then glory. (2:102)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p18"></A><b>16 </b>A green olive, fair in fruit <i>and </i>form, Hath Jehovah called thy name; At the noise of great tumult hath he kindled a <i>fire </i>on it, And broken down are its branches: (2:105)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p19"></A><b>17 </b>For Jehovah of hosts who planted thee Hath spoken against thee an evil, For the wickedness of the house of Israel And of the house of Judah, Which they have done for themselves, To provoke me by offering incense to Baal.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p20"></A><b>18 </b>Jehovah hath made me to know, and I knew it; Thou didst then discover to me their works.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p21"></A><b>19 </b>But I was like a lamb <i>or </i>an ox Led to be slain; and I knew not That they meditated thoughts against me: &#8220;Let us spoil with wood his bread, And cut him off from the land of the living; And let his name be remembered no more.&#8221; (2:113)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p22"></A><b>20 </b>Now, Jehovah of hosts, who judgest righteously, Who searchest the reins and the heart, Let me see thy vengeance on them, For to thee have I revealed my cause.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p23"></A><b>21 </b>Therefore thus saith Jehovah To the men of Anathoth, who seek thy life and say, &#8220;Prophesy thou not in the name of Jehovah, That thou mayest not die by our hand;&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p24"></A><b>22 </b>Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, &#8212; Behold, I will visit them; Their young men shall die by the sword, Their sons and their daughters shall die by famine,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p25"></A><b>23 </b>And there shall be no remnant of them; For I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, In the year of their visitation.</p>  <a name="xii.iii"></A>

<p><a name="xii.iii-p3"></A><b>1 </b>Just <i>art </i>thou, Jehovah, though I contend with thee; Yet of judgments will I speak to thee: How long shall the way of the ungodly prosper? Secure are all they who by transgressing transgress. (2:121)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Thou hast planted them, they have even taken root; They have grown, they have even produced fruit: Nigh art thou in their mouth, But far from their reins.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>But thou, Jehovah, knowest me, Thou seest me and hast tried my heart towards thee; Draw them forth as sheep for the slaughter, And prepare them for the day of destruction.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>How long shall mourn the land, And the grass of every field wither For the wickedness of those who dwell in it? Consumed are the beasts and the birds, Because they have said, &#8220;He shall not see our end.&#8221; (2:129)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>If with footmen thou hast run, And they have wearied thee, How canst thou contend with horsemen? In the land of peace thou hast trusted, How then canst thou do in the rising of Jordan?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Truly, even thy brethren and the house of thy father, Even these act perfidiously towards thee; Yea, they cry after thee with a loud voice: Trust them not, even when they speak good things to thee.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>I have forsaken my house, I have left my heritage; I have given up the darling of my soul Into the hand of her enemies!</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>My heritage has become to me like a lion in the forest; It has sent forth its voice against me; Therefore have I hated it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Is my heritage to me a speckled bird? Is there not a bird around over it? Come, gather yourselves all ye beasts of the field; Come to devour it. (2:140)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, They have trodden under foot my portion, They have made nay choice portion a desolate wilderness;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>They have made it a desolation, It mourns to me, being desolate; Desolate is become the whole land; Though no one hath laid it to heart.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>On all high places in the wilderness have come destroyers; For the sword of Jehovah hath devoured, From one end to the other end of the land; There is no peace to any flesh.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p15"></A><b>13 </b>They have sown wheat And thorns have they reaped; An heritage have they got, but have not succeeded: Ashamed have they been of your produce, Through the burning of the wrath of Jehovah. (2:149)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p16"></A><b>14 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; As to all my evil neighbors, Who touch my heritage, Which I have inherited, <i>even </i>my people Israel, Behold, I will pluck them up from their land, And the house of Judah Will I pluck up from the midst of them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p17"></A><b>15 </b>And it shall be, after I draw them out, That I shall return and shew mercy to them, And will restore them, every one to his heritage, And every one to his own land.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p18"></A><b>16 </b>And it shall be, that if by learning they will learn The ways of my people, To swear by my name, &#8220;Live does Jehovah,&#8221; As they taught my people to swear by Baal, They shall then be built up In the midst of my people:</p>

<p><a name="xii.iv-p3"></A><b>1 </b>Thus saith Jehovah to me, &#8212; Go and get thee a linen belt, and put it on thy loins, and</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iv-p4"></A><b>2</b> In water set it not. So I got for me a belt, as Jehovah had</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iv-p5"></A><b>3 </b>commanded, and put it on my loins. Then came the word of</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iv-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Jehovah to me again, saying, &#8212; Take the belt which thou hast got, which is on thy loins, and rise, go to Euphrates and hide</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iv-p7"></A><b>5</b> I<i>t </i>there in the hole of a rock. Then I went and hid it by</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iv-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Euphrates, as Jehovah had ordered me. And it was, that at the end of many days, Jehovah said to me, Rise and go to Euphrates, and take thence the belt which I commanded thee</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iv-p9"></A><b>7</b> To hide there. So I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the belt from the place where I had hid it; and behold the belt</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iv-p10"></A><b>8</b> Was marred, <i>and </i>it was good for nothing. Then came the word of Jehovah to me, saying, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iv-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; In this way will I mar the excellency of Judah And the great excellency of Jerusalem:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iv-p12"></A><b>10 </b>This wicked people, who refuse to hear my words, Who walk in the wickedness of their own heart, And walk after foreign gods, That they may serve them and worship them, &#8212; Shall be even as this belt, Which is good for nothing.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iv-p13"></A><b>11 </b>For as the belt cleaves to the loins of man, So had I joined to me the whole house of Israel And the whole house of Judah, saith Jehovah, That they might be to me a people and a name, Yea, a praise and a glory; But they hearkened not.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iv-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Thou shalt also say this word to them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, &#8212; Every bottle shall be filled with wine. When they shall say to thee, Knowing do we not know, that every</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iv-p15"></A><b>13</b> Bottle shall be filled with wine? then shalt thou say to them, &#8212; Thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; Behold, I will fill with drunkenness All the inhabitants of this land, And all the kings who sit for David on his throne, The priests also and the prophets, And all the inhabitants of Jerusalem;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iv-p16"></A><b>14 </b>And I will dash them, every one against his brother, The fathers also and the sons together, saith Jehovah: I will not spare, nor will I be propitious, Nor shew pity until I destroy them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iv-p17"></A><b>15 </b>Hear ye and attend, be not lifted up, For Jehovah hath spoken:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iv-p18"></A><b>16 </b>Give to Jehovah your God the glory, Before he makes it to grow dark, And before your feet stumble at the dark mountains, And <i>before </i>he turns the light ye hope for Into the shadow of death, And makes it thick darkness. (2:179)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iv-p19"></A><b>17 </b>But if ye will not hear this, In secret will my soul mourn for pride, And weeping my eye will weep And run down with tears; For led captive is the flock of Jehovah.</p>

<p><a name="xii.iv-p21"></A><b>19 </b>The cities of the south are closed up, And there is no one to open <i>them; </i>For carried away has been all Judah, He has been carried away completely. (2:185)</p>

<p><a name="xii.x-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And thou shalt say, Hear the word of Jehovah, ye kings of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, &#8212; Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, &#8212; Behold I bring an evil on this place, The which whosoever hears, tingle shall his ears:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Because they have forsaken me, And have alienated this place, And have made incense in it to foreign gods, Whom they have not themselves known, Nor their fathers, nor the kings of Judah, And have filled this place With the blood of innocents:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p7"></A><b>5 </b>And they have built high places to Baal, To burn their sons with fire, For a burnt-offering to Baal; Which I have not commanded nor spoken of, And <i>which </i>came not into my mind.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Therefore behold the days shall come, saith Jehovah, When this place shall no more be called Tophet, Nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, But, The valley of slaughter:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p9"></A><b>7 </b>And void will I make the counsel of Judah And of Jerusalem in this place, And lay them prostrate by the sword before their enemies, And by the hand of those who seek their life; And I will give their carcasses for meat To the birds of heaven and to the beasts of the earth;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p10"></A><b>8 </b>And will set this city For an astonishment and for hissing; Whosoever shall pass through it shall be astonished, And shall hiss on account of all her stroke:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p11"></A><b>9 </b>And I will feed them with the flesh of their sons, And with the flesh of their daughters; And they shall eat, every one the flesh of his friend, In the tribulation and straitness, By which their enemies shall straiten them, And those who seek their life.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Then shalt thou break the bottle in the presence of the men who shall go with thee;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p13"></A><b>11</b> And thou shalt say to them, &#8212; Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, &#8212; So will I break this people and this city, As one breaks an earthen vessel, Which can no more be repaired: And in Tophet shall they be buried, For there will be no <i>other </i>place to bury <i>them:</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Thus will I do to this place, Saith Jehovah, and to its inhabitants, I will even make this city like Tophet;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p15"></A><b>13 </b>For the houses of Jerusalem, And the houses of the kings of Judah, Shall be, like the place of Tophet, unclean, Even all the houses, on whose roofs They have made incense to all the host of heaven, And poured a libation to foreign gods.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p16"></A><b>14 </b>Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, where Jehovah had sent him to prophesy, and stood in the court of the house of Jehovah, and said to the whole people, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p17"></A><b>15 </b>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, &#8212; Behold, I will bring upon this city And upon all her towns, all the evil Which I have pronounced against her; Because they have hardened their neck, That they might not hear my words.</p>
