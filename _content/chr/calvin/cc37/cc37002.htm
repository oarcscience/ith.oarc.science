<p><a name="iii.i-p2"></A><b>1.</b> And certain which came down from Judea did teach his brethren, that unless they should be circumcised according to the manner of Moses, they could not be saved. <b>2.</b> And when there arose sedition, and disputing not a little to Paul and Barnabas against them, they appointed that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to the apostles and elders to Jerusalem about this question. <b>3.</b> And when they were sent by 				  the Church, they passed through.

<p><a name="iii.i-p5"></A><b>1.</b> When Paul and Barnabas had endured many combats against the professed enemies of the gospel, Luke doth now begin to declare that they were tried by domestic war; so that it was meet that their doctrine and ministry should be proved by all means, to the end it might the better appear that they were furnished by God, and armed against all the assaults of the world and Satan. For that was no small confirmation for their doctrine, in that 			 being shaken and battered with so many engines, it stood nevertheless, neither could the course thereof be broken off by so many hindrances. Therefore, to this end doth Paul boast that he suffered fights without and terrors within, (<a name="iii.i-p5.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005">2Co 7:5</a><a name="iii.i-p5.1"></A>.) This history is most worthy the noting; for though we do naturally abhor the cross and all manner [of] persecution, yet civil and domestic discord is more 			 dangerous, lest haply they discourage us.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">68</FONT></A>
 			 When tyrants bend their force and run violently upon men, flesh indeed is afraid; and all those who are not endued with the spirit of fortitude do tremble with all their heart; but then their consciences are not properly touched with any temptation. For this is known to be as it were the fatal estate of the Church. But when it falleth out so that the brethren go together by the ears, and that the Church is on an uproar within itself, it cannot be but that weak minds shall be troubled 			 and also faint; and especially when the controversy is about doctrine, which alone is the holy bond of brotherly unity. Finally, there is nothing which doth more indamage the gospel than civil discord, because it doth not only pierce and wound weak conscience, but also minister occasion to the wicked to backbite.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.i-p7"></A>Wherefore, we must diligently note this history, that we may know that it is no new example, if among those who profess the same gospel there arise some wranglings and strife about doctrine, when proud men can get them a name, (whereof they are so furiously desirous,) by no other means but by bringing in their own inventions. It is certain, that as there is but one God, so there is but one truth of this God.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">69</FONT></A>
 			 Therefore, when Paul goeth about to exhort the faithful unto mutual consent, he useth this argument, &#8220;One God, one faith, one baptism,&#8221; etc., (<a name="iii.i-p8.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#006">Eph 4:6</a><a name="iii.i-p8.2"></A>.) But when we see wicked men arise, who go about to divide [rend] the Church by their factions, and also either to corrupt the gospel with their false and filthy [spurious] inventions, or else to bring the same in suspicion, we ought to know the 			 subtlety [artifice] of Satan. Therefore, Paul saith elsewhere that heresies come abroad, that those who are tried may be made manifest, (<a name="iii.i-p8.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#019">1Co 11:19</a><a name="iii.i-p8.3"></A>.) And, assuredly, the Lord doth wonderfully make void the subtlety of Satan, in that he trieth the faith of his by such trials, and doth beautify his word with worthy and excellent victory; and causeth the truth to shine more clearly which the wicked 			 went about to darken. But it is very convenient to weigh all the circumstances of the history which Luke noteth.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.i-p9"></A><i>Which came down from Judea.</i> This cloak and color was very forcible to deceive even good men then. Jerusalem was honored not without cause among all churches, because they reverenced it even as their mother. For the gospel was deducted, as it were, by pipes and conduits   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">70</FONT></A>
 			  from that fountain. These seducers come thence; they pretend the apostles; they boast that they bring nothing but that which they learned of them. They blind and blear the eyes of the unskillful with this smoke; and those who are light and wicked do greedily snatch at the color which is offered them. The perturbation of the Church doth, like a tempest, shake those who were otherwise good and moderate, so that they are enforced to stumble. Therefore, we must note 			 this subtlety of Satan, that he abuseth the names of holy men that he may deceive the simple, who, being won with the reverence of the men, dare not inquire after the thing itself. Luke doth not express, indeed, with what affection these knaves were moved; yet it is likely that perverse zeal was the cause which moved them to set themselves against Paul and Barnabas; for there be certain churlish natures which nothing can please but that which is their own. They had seen that circumcision and 			 other rites of the law were observed at Jerusalem; wheresoever they become, they can abide nothing which is not agreeable thereto, as if the example of one church did bind all the rest of the churches with a certain law. And though such be carried with a preposterous zeal to procure tumults, yet are they pricked inwardly with their ambition, and with a certain kind of stubbornness. Nevertheless, Satan hath that he would; for the minds of the godly have such a mist cast before them that they can 			 scarce know black from white.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.i-p11"></A>Therefore, we must beware first of this plague, that some prescribe not a law to other some after their manner, that the example of one church be not a prejudice  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">71</FONT></A>
 			 of a common rule. Also, we must use another caution, that the persons of men do not hinder or darken the examination of the matter or cause. For if Satan transfigure himself into an angel of light, (<a name="iii.i-p12.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014">2Co 11:14</a><a name="iii.i-p12.2"></A>,) and if, by sacrilegious boldness, he usurp the holy name of God, what marvel is it if he do like wickedly deceive men under the names of holy men? The end shall at length 			 declare that the apostles meant nothing less than  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">72</FONT></A>
 			 to lay the yoke of the law upon the neck of the Gentiles; and yet Satan meant under this shift to get in. So it falleth out oftentimes that those who contrary [oppose] the doctrine of Christ, creep in under the title of his servants. Therefore, there is one only remedy, to come to search out the matter  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A>
 			 with sound judgments; also it behoveth us to prevent an offense, lest we think that the faithful servants of God do therefore strive among themselves, because Satan doth falsely abuse their names, that he may set certain shadows by the ears together to terrify the simple.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.i-p15"></A><a name="iii.i-p15.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.i-p16"></A><b>2.</b><i> When there was sedition arisen.</i> This was no small trial, in that Paul and Barnabas are haled into a troublesome tumult. There was mischief enough already in the matter [dissension] itself; but it is a more cruel mischief when the contention waxeth so hot, that they are enforced to fight with their brethren as 			 with enemies. Add, moreover, the infamy wherewith they saw themselves burdened among the simple and unskillful, as if they would trouble the peace of the Church with their stubbornness. For it falleth out oftentimes so, that the faithful servants of Christ are envied alone, and bear all the blame, after that they have been unjustly troubled, and have faithfully employed themselves in defense of a good cause. Therefore, they must be endued with invincible courage to despise all false reports 			 which are carried about concerning them. Therefore, Paul boasteth in another place that he went through the midst of seditions, (<a name="iii.i-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005">2Co 6:5</a><a name="iii.i-p16.1"></A>.) But the servants of God must observe such moderation, that they abhor so much as they can all discord; if at any time Satan raise tumults and contentions, let them endeavor to appease them, and, finally, let them do all that they can to 			 foster and cherish unity. But again, on the other side, when the truth of God is assailed, let them refuse no combat for defense thereof; nor let them fear to oppose themselves valiantly, though heaven and earth go together.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.i-p17"></A>And let us, being admonished by this example, learn, so often as there ariseth any tumult in the Church, wisely to weigh through whose fault it came, lest we rashly condemn the faithful ministers of Christ, whose gravity is rather to be praised, because they can abide so valiantly such violent assaults of Satan. Secondly, let us call to mind that Satan was bridled by the wonderful providence of God, that he might not put the doctrine of Paul 			 to the foil. For if he had been suffered to do hurt at his pleasure, so soon as the faith of the Gentiles had been pulled down and overthrown, the gospel preached by Paul should have fallen to the ground, and the gate should have [been] shut against the calling of the Gentiles. Thirdly, let us learn that we must in time prevent dissension, of what sort soever it be, lest it break out into the flame of contention; because Satan seeketh nothing else by the fans of dissension but to kindle so many 			 fires. But again, seeing we see the primitive Church on an uproar, and the best servants of Christ exercised with sedition, if the same thing befall us now, let us not fear as in some new and unwonted matter; but, craving at the Lord&#8217;s hands such an end as he now made, let us pass through tumults with the same tenor of faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.i-p18"></A><i>Unless ye be circumcised.</i> Luke setteth [defineth] down briefly in these words the state of the question, to wit, that these seducers went about to bind men&#8217;s consciences with necessity of keeping the law. Circumcision is indeed mentioned alone in this place; but it appeareth by the text that they moved the question about the keeping of 			 the whole Law. And, because circumcision was, as it were, a solemn entrance and admission into other rites of the law, therefore, by <i>synecdoche, </i>the whole law is comprehended under one part. These enemies of Paul did not deny that Christ was the Messiah; but though they gave him their names, they retained therewithal the old ceremonies of the law.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.i-p19"></A>The error might have seemed tolerable at the first glimpse. Why doth not Paul then dissemble, at least, for some short time, lest he shake the Church with conflict? for the disputation was concerning external matters, concerning which Paul himself forbiddeth elsewhere to stand and strive too much. But there were three weighty causes which enforced him to gainstand. For, if the keeping of the law be necessary, man&#8217;s salvation is tied to works, 			 which must be grounded in the grace of Christ alone, that the faith may be settled and quiet. Therefore, when Paul saw the worship of the law set against the free righteousness of faith, it was unlawful for him to hold his peace, unless he would betray Christ. For, seeing the adversaries did deny that any should be saved, save he which did observe the law of Moses, by this means they did translate unto works the glory of salvation, which they took from Christ, and having shaken assurance, they 			 did vex miserable souls with unquietness. Again, it was no small thing, neither of any small importance, to spoil and rob faithful souls of the liberty gotten by Christ&#8217;s blood. Though the inward liberty of the Spirit were common to the fathers as well as to us, yet we know what Paul saith, that they were shut up under the childish ward and custody of the law, so that they did not much differ from servants; but we are loose from the schoolmastership of the law after that Christ was revealed, 			 (<a name="iii.i-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024">Ga 3:24</a><a name="iii.i-p19.1"></A>,) and we have more liberty, the time of our nonage being, as it were, ended. The third vice of this doctrine was, because it darkened the light of the Church,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">74</FONT></A>
 			 or at least did put in, as it were, certain clouds, that Christ the Sun of righteousness might not give perfect light. In sum, Christianity should shortly have come to nothing if Paul should have yielded to such beginnings. Therefore, he entereth the combat, not for the external uncircumcision of the flesh, but for the free salvation of men. Secondly, that he may acquit and set free godly consciences from the curse of the law, and the guilt of eternal death. Last of all, that 			 after all hindrances are driven away, the brightness of the grace of Christ may shine as in a pleasant and clear heaven. Moreover, these knaves did great injury to the law when they did wickedly corrupt the right use thereof. This was the natural and right office of the law, to lead men by the hand, like a schoolmaster, unto Christ; therefore, it could not be worse corrupt than when, under color of it, the power and grace of Christ were diminished.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.i-p21"></A>After this sort must we look into the fountains of all questions, lest by our silence we betray the truth of God, so often as we see Satan, by his subtlety, aim right at it; neither let our minds be changed and wax faint through any perils, or reproaches and slanders, because we must constantly defend pure religion, though heaven and earth must [should] go together. The servants of Christ must be no fighters, (<a name="iii.i-p21.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024">2Ti 2:24</a><a name="iii.i-p21.1"></A>;)therefore, if there be any contention risen, they must rather study to appease and pacify the same by their moderation, than by and by to blow to the assault.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">75</FONT></A>
 			 Secondly, they must take good heed of superfluous and vain conflicts; neither shall they handle controversies of any small weight; but when they see Satan wax so proud, that religion cannot any longer continue safe and sound unless he be prevented, they must needs take a good heart to them, and rise to resist; neither let them fear to enter even most hateful combats. The name of peace is indeed plausible and sweet, but cursed is that peace which is purchased with so great loss, that 			 we suffer the doctrine of Christ to perish, by which alone we grow together into godly and holy unity.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.i-p23"></A>The Papists cause us at this day to be sore hated, as if we had been the causers of deadly tumults, wherewith the world is shaken; but we can well defend ourselves, because the blasphemies which we endeavored to reprove were more cruel  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">76</FONT></A>
 			 than that it was lawful for us to hold our peace; there we are not to be blamed, because we have taken upon us to enter combats in defense of that cause, for which we were to fight even with the very angels. Let them cry till their throats be sore; Paul&#8217;s example is sufficient for us, that we must not be either cold or slack in defending the doctrine of godliness when the ministers of Satan seek to overthrow it with might and main; for their brainsick distemperature ought not to pass  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">77</FONT></A>
 			 the constancy of the servants of God. When Paul did zealously set himself against the false apostles, sedition began at length  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_77"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">78</FONT></A>
 			 by reason of the conflict; and yet the Spirit of God doth not therefore reprove him; but doth rather with due praises commend that fortitude which he had given that holy man.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.i-p27"></A><i>They determined, etc.</i> The Spirit of God put them in mind of this remedy to appease the tumult, which might otherwise have gone farther with doing much hurt, whereby we be also taught, that we must always seek such means as be fit   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">79</FONT></A>
 			  for ending discord; because God doth so highly commend peace, let the faithful show   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">80</FONT></A>
 			  that they do what they can to nourish the peace of the Church. The truth must always be first in order with them, in defense whereof they must be afraid of no tumults; yet they must so temper their heat that they refuse no means of godly agreement; yea, let them of their own accord invent what ways soever they can, and let them be witty in seeking them out. Therefore, we must observe this mean, lest being carried away through immoderate vehemency of zeal we be 			 carried beyond the just bounds; for we must be courageous in defense of true doctrine, not stubborn, nor rash; therefore, let us learn to join together these two virtues which the Spirit of God commandeth in Paul. When he is drawn into the field by the wicked, he is not afraid boldly to offer himself; but when he doth meekly admit the remedy which was offered, he declareth plainly what small desire he had to fight, for otherwise he might have boasted that he did not pass for the apostles, 			   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">81</FONT></A>
 			  and so have stood stoutly in that; but the desire of peace did not suffer him to refuse their judgment. Moreover, ignorant and weak men should have conceived a sinister opinion, if they should have seen two men only separated from all the servants of Christ; and godly teachers must in no case neglect this way to cherish faith, that they may show that they agree with the Church.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.i-p31"></A>Paul, indeed, did not depend upon the beck of the apostles, that he would change his opinion if he should have found them contrary to him, who would not have given place even to the very angels, as he boasteth in first chapter to the Galatians, (<a name="iii.i-p31.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008">Ga 1:8</a><a name="iii.i-p31.1"></A>;) but lest the wicked should slanderously report that he was a man that stood too much in his own 			 conceit, and which was too proud, and which did please himself with an unseemly contempt of all men, he offered to give an account of his doctrine, as it became him, and as it was profitable for the Church; secondly, he presented himself before the apostles with sure hope of victory, because he knew full well what would be their judgment, seeing they were guided by the same Spirit wherewith he was governed. Notwithstanding, it may be demanded for what purpose the men of Antioch sent Paul and 			 Barnabas unto the rest of the apostles; for if they did so greatly reverence them, that they stood in doubt until they had given judgment on this side or that, their faith was hitherto vain and altogether none? But the answer is easy, seeing they knew that all the apostles were sent  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">82</FONT></A>
 			 by Christ alone with the same commandments, and that they had the same Spirit given them, they were fully persuaded of the end and success, and, undoubtedly, this counsel proceeded from honest and stout men, who were not ignorant that the knaves did falsely pretend the names of James and Peter. Wherefore, they sought nothing else but that the apostles might further a good matter with their consent.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">83</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.i-p34"></A>To the same end were all holy synods assembled since the beginning, that grave men, and such as were well exercised in the word of God, might decide controversies, not after their own pleasure, but according to the authority of God. This is worth the noting, lest the Papists pierce any man with their loud outcries,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">84</FONT></A>
 			 who, to the end they may overthrow Christ and his gospel, and put out all the light of godliness, thrust upon us Councils, as if every definition and determination of men were to be counted an heavenly oracle; but if the holy Fathers had their sitting at this day, they would cry with one mouth, that there was nothing more unlawful for them, neither did they mean any thing less than to set down or deliver any thing without having the word of Christ for their guide, who was their 			 only teacher, [master,] even as he is ours. I omit this, that the Papists lean only unto untimely  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">85</FONT></A>
 			 Councils, which breathe out nothing but gross ignorance and barbarism; but even the best and most choice must be reckoned in that number, that they may be subject to the word of God. There is a grievous complaint of Gregory Nazianzene extant, that there was never any Council which had a good end. What excellency soever did flourish and was in force in the Church, it cannot be denied but that it began to decay an hundred years after; therefore, if that holy man were now living, how 			 stoutly would he reject the toys of the Papists, who, without all shame, most impudently bring in the jugglings of visors instead of lawful Councils, and that to that end, that the Word of God may pack,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">86</FONT></A>
 			 so soon as a few bald and foolish men have set down whatsoever pleased them?</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.i-p38"></A><a name="iii.i-p38.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.i-p39"></A><b>3.</b><i> Being brought on the way by the Church.</i> Whereas, by the common consent of the Church, there were joined to Paul and Barnabas companions, who might, for duty&#8217;s sake, conduct them, we may thereby gather, that all the godly were on their side; and that they did never otherwise think but that the cause was theirs 			 as well as the apostles. Wherefore they determined the journey of Paul and Barnabas with like minds as they took it in hand; to wit, that they might tame and put to silence those troublesome spirits who did falsely make boast of the apostles. Whereas he saith shortly after, that they certified the brethren in their voyage of the wonderful conversion of the Gentiles, it is a testimony and token that they came not to Jerusalem fraught with fear; but that they did even without fear stoutly profess 			 that which they had taught before. Therefore, they come not to plead their cause before their judges; but that they may, with common consent and judgment, on both sides, approve that which was commanded by God touching the abolishing of ceremonies. For though they did not despise the judgment of the apostles, yet because they knew that it was not lawful for them, neither for the apostles, to decree otherwise concerning the cause, it did not become them to stand as men whose matter is handled at 			 the bar.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">87</FONT></A>
 			  Thence cometh the boldness of rejoicing; to this end   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">88</FONT></A>
 			  tendeth the joy of the godly, whereby they subscribe both to the doctrine of Paul and also the calling of the Gentiles.</p>

<p><a name="iii.i-p43"></A><b>4.</b><i> They were received of the Church.</i> By this word<i> Church</i> he meaneth the multitude itself and the whole body; that done, he assigneth a peculiar place to the apostles and elders, by whom Paul and 			 Barnabas were specially received. Furthermore, because the apostles had no certain place of abode at Jerusalem, but went ever now and then sometimes to one place and sometimes to another, whithersoever occasion did call them, that church had elders to whom the ordinary government of the Church was committed; and what the one function differeth from the other we have before declared, (<a name="iii.i-p43.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023">Ac 14:23</a><a name="iii.i-p43.1"></A>.) And hereby it appeareth what brotherly courtesy there was in the apostles and elders, because they do not only courteously receive Paul and Barnabas, but so soon as they hear what success they had with their pains they took, they magnify the grace of God. Luke repeateth again that form of speech which we had before in the chapter next going before, when he saith, that they declared whatsoever things God had done with them. Wherein we must remember that which I said before, that 			 God is not made a fellow-laborer, but all the whole praise of the work is ascribed to him. Therefore it is said, that he did that with Paul and Barnabas which he did by them, as he is said to deal mercifully with us when he helpeth our miseries.</p>

<p><a name="iii.i-p45"></A><b>5.</b><i> Certain of the sect of the Pharisees.</i> It is not without cause that Luke expresseth what kind of men they were which went about to trouble or hinder Paul, even at Jerusalem also. And it is to be thought that the evil flowed from that fountain; and that Luke doth now more plainly express, that there brake out 			 now also fans [disturbers] out of that very same sect, from whence the authors of that wicked dissension came. For though they had given Christ their names, yet there remained relics of their former nature. We know how proud the Pharisees were, how haughty, how lofty their looks were;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">89</FONT></A>
 			  all which they would have forgotten if they had truly put on Christ. Like as there remained no Phariseeism in Paul, but a great part had gotten the habit of stubbornness by long custom, which they could not shake off so easily by and by. Forasmuch as there reigned most of all among them hypocrisy, they were too much addicted to external rites, which are coverings for vices. They were likewise puffed up with pride, so that they did tyrannously covet to make all other 			 men subject to their decrees. It is well-known how sore sick the monks are of both diseases. Whereby it cometh to pass, that nothing is more cruel than they to oppress the Church, nothing is more wicked or forward than they to despise the Word of God.

 			  judges in this matter. It may be, indeed, that the disputation was had in presence of the people. But lest any man should think that the common people were suffered hand over head to handle the matter, Luke doth plainly make mention of the apostles and elders, as it was more meet that they should hear the matter and to decide it.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">92</FONT></A>
 			  But let us know, that here is prescribed by God a form and an order in assembling synods, when there ariseth any controversy which cannot otherwise be decided. For seeing that many did daily gainstand Paul, this disputation alone, by reason whereof there was great ruin like to ensue, and which was already come to hot combats, did enforce him to go to Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a name="iii.ii-p9"></A><b>7.</b><i> And when there had been great disputation.</i> Though there were choice made of grave men, and such as were public teachers of the Church, yet could not they agree by and by.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_92"></A><A HREF="#fn_92"><FONT SIZE="1">93</FONT></A>
 			  Whereby appeareth how the Lord did exercise his Church, even then, by the infirmity of men, that it might learn to be wise with humility. Moreover, he suffered (even in that company and assembly wherein he was chief) the principal point of Christian doctrine to be diversely tossed and handled, lest we should wonder, if at any time it so fall out, that men, who are otherwise learned and godly, do, through unskillfulness, fall into an error. For some were not so quick 			 witted [acute] that they could thoroughly see into the greatness of the matter. So that when they judge that the law ought to be kept, being unadvisedly carried away with the zeal of the law, they see not into how deep a labyrinth they throw the consciences of other men, and their own also. They thought that circumcision was an eternal and inviolable token of God&#8217;s covenant; the same opinion had they of all the whole law. Wherefore Peter standeth chiefly upon this, to show the state of the 			 question, which the most of them knew not. And his oration hath two members. For, first, he proveth by the authority of God that the Gentiles must not be enforced to keep the law; secondly, he teacheth that all man&#8217;s salvation is overthrown, if the conscience be once caught in this snare. Therefore, the former part (wherein he declareth that he was sent of God to teach the Gentiles, and that the Holy Spirit came down upon them) tendeth to this end, that men did not unadvisedly disannul the 			 ceremonies of the law, but that God is the author of that disannulling. And so soon as the authority of God is brought forth, all doubting is taken away, because this is all our wisdom, to stay ourselves upon the authority, government, and commandment of God,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">94</FONT></A>
 			  and to make more account of his beck and pleasure than of all reasons. Now, it is meet that we ponder the words of Peter, whereby he proveth that this was granted to the Gentiles by God, to be free from the yoke of the law.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p12"></A><i>You know.</i> He calleth them to bear witness, (and unto them he appealeth,) lest any man should think that he is about to speak of some dark and doubtful thing. The history was well known to them all. That which remained, he showeth that they were blind even in most clear light, yea, because they had not long ago learned that which was 			 openly showed. He calleth the beginning of the preaching of the gospel old days, or the old time, as if he should say, ago, as it were since the first beginning of the Church, after that Christ began to gather to himself any people.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p13"></A><i>God did choose in us.</i> The word <i>choose </i>doth signify to appoint or decree. Though Peter doth comprehend as well the free election of God as the choice whereby God did adopt the Gentiles to be his people; therefore, he chose, that is, as it were, making choice, that he might show a token 			 of his free election in the Gentiles, he would that by my mouth they should hear the doctrine of the gospel. These words,<i> in us,</i> do import as much as in our sight, or we being witnesses, or among us.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_94"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">95</FONT></A>
 			  For his meaning is, that he declareth nothing but that which they knew full well; to wit, which was done before their eyes. The phrase is common enough both among the Grecians, and also among the Hebretians, [Hebrews,] unless we had liefer resolve it as some other do, He hath chosen me out of this company.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p15"></A><i>And believe.</i> This was a seal to confirm the calling of the Gentiles. The office of teaching was enjoined Peter by an oracle; but the fruit which came of his doctrine doth make his ministry noble and authentical, as they call it. For, seeing that the elect are illuminate into the faith by a peculiar grace of the Spirit, doctrine shall 			 bring forth no fruit, unless the Lord show forth his power in his ministers, in teaching the minds of those inwardly which hear, and in drawing their hearts inwardly. Therefore, seeing the Lord commanded that the doctrine of the gospel should be brought unto the Gentiles, he did sanctify them to himself, that they might be no longer profane. But the solemn consecration was then perfect in all points, when he imprinted in their hearts, by faith, the mark of their adoption. The sentence which 			 followeth immediately is to be understood as set down by way of exposition;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">96</FONT></A>
 			  for Peter annexeth the visible graces of the Spirit unto faith, as, assuredly, they were nothing else but an addition thereof. Therefore, seeing that the Gentiles are ingrafted into the people of God without circumcision and ceremonies, Peter gathereth that it was not well done to lay upon them any necessity to keep the law. Yet it seemeth to be but a weak argument to prove their election withal, because the Holy Ghost came down upon them. For they were such gifts 			 that they could not reason from the same, that they were reckoned in the number of the godly. But it is the Spirit of regeneration alone which distinguisheth the children of God from strangers. I answer, Though men, who were otherwise vain, were endued with the gift of tongues and such like, yet doth Peter take for a thing which all men grant, that which was known, that God had sealed in Cornelius and his cousins [relatives] his free adoption by the visible grace of the Spirit, as if he should 			 point out his children with his finger.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p17"></A><i>The knower of the hearts.</i> He applieth this adjunct to God, according to the circumstance of the present matter; and it hath under it a secret contrariety,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">97</FONT></A>
 			  that men are more addicted to external purity, because they judge according to their gross and earthly sense and understanding; but God doth look into the heart. Therefore, Peter teacheth that they judge preposterously in this matter according to man&#8217;s understanding, seeing that the inward pureness of the heart alone is here to be esteemed, which we know not.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">98</FONT></A>
 			  And by this means doth he bridle our rashness, lest, taking to ourselves more than we ought, we murmur against the judgment of God. As if he should say, if thou see no reason of that testimony which God gave them, think with thyself what great difference there is between him and thee. For thou art holden with external pomp according to thy gross nature, which must be abandoned when we come to the throne of God,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">99</FONT></A>
 			  where the hearts of men are known spiritually. But, in the mean season, we must note a general doctrine, that the eyes of God do not look upon the vain pomp of men,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_99"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">100</FONT></A>
 			  but upon the integrity of men&#8217;s hearts, as it is written, (<a name="iii.ii-p21.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003">Jer 5:3</a><a name="iii.ii-p21.2"></A>.) Whereas the old interpreter and Erasmus translate it, that God knoweth the hearts, it doth not sufficiently express that which Luke saith in Greek; for when he calleth God <a name="iii.ii-p21.3"></A>&#954;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#953;&#945;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#957;, he setteth him against   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">101</FONT></A>

<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.ii-p23"></A><a name="iii.ii-p23.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p24"></A><b>9.</b><i> And he put no difference.</i> There was indeed some difference, because the Gentiles who were uncircumcised were suddenly admitted unto the covenant of eternal life; whereas the Jews were prepared by circumcision unto faith. But Peter&#8217;s meaning is, that they were both chosen   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_101"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">102</FONT></A>
 			  together by God unto the hope of the same inheritance, and that they were extolled into the like degree of honor, that they might be the children of God and members of Christ, and, finally, the holy seed of Abraham, a priestly and princely generation. Whereupon it followeth, that they cannot without sacrilege be counted unclean, sithence God hath chosen them to be a peculiar people, and hath consecrated them to be holy vessels of his temple. For the wall of 			 separation being pulled down, whereby the Gentiles and Jews were divided among themselves, he hath joined the Gentiles to the Jews, that they might grow together into one body, (<a name="iii.ii-p25.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014">Eph 2:14</a><a name="iii.ii-p25.2"></A>;) and that I may so say, he hath mixed circumcision and uncircumcision together, that as well those of the household as strangers may be one in Christ, and may make one Church; and that there 			 may not be any longer either Jew or Grecian.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p26"></A><i>Seeing that by faith he hath purified.</i> This member is answerable to that former adjunct which he applieth to God; as if he should say, that God, who knoweth the hearts, did inwardly purge the Gentiles, when he vouchsafed to make them partakers of his adoption, that they might be endued with spiritual cleanness. But he addeth farther, 			 that this purity did consist in faith. Therefore he teacheth, first, that the Gentiles have true holiness without ceremonies, which may suffice before God&#8217;s judgment-seat. Secondly, he teacheth that this is attained unto by faith, and from it doth it flow. In like sort, Paul gathereth, that uncircumcision doth not hinder a man but that he may be counted holy and just before God, (<a name="iii.ii-p26.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#010">Ro 4:10</a><a name="iii.ii-p26.1"></A>;) because circumcision did follow after righteousness in the person of Abraham, and by order of time it was latter, [posterior.]</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p27"></A>But here ariseth a question, whether that purity which the fathers had in times past were unlike to that which God gave now to the Gentiles? For it seemeth that Peter distinguisheth the Gentiles from the Jews by this mark, because, being content with the cleanness of the heart alone, they need no help of the law. I answer, that the one of them differ from the other, not in substance, but in form, [only.] For God had respect always unto the 			 inward cleanness of the heart; and the ceremonies were given to the old [ancient] people only for this cause, that they might help their faith. So that cleanness, as touching figures and exercises, was only for a time, until the coming of Christ, which hath no place among us at this day; like as there remaineth from the very beginning of the world unto the end the same true worship of God, to wit, the spiritual worship; yet is there great difference in the visible form. Now, we see that the 			 fathers did not obtain righteousness by ceremonies, neither were they therefore pure before God, but by the cleanness of the heart. For the ceremonies of themselves were of no importance to justify them; but they were only helps, which did accidentally (that I may so term it) purge them; yet so that the fathers and we had the same truth. Now, when Christ came, all that which was accidental did vanish away; and, therefore, seeing the shadows be driven away, there remaineth the bare and plain 			 pureness of the heart.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p28"></A>Thus is that objection easily answered which the Jews think cannot possibly be answered. Circumcision is called the eternal covenant, or of the world, (<a name="iii.ii-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#013">Ge 17:13</a><a name="iii.ii-p28.1"></A>;) therefore, say they, it was not to be abolished. If any man shall say that this is not referred unto the visible sign, but rather unto the thing figured, it shall be well answered; but there 			 is another answer besides this. Seeing that the kingdom of Christ was a certain renewing of the world, there shall no inconvenience follow if he made an end of  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">103</FONT></A>
 			 all the shadows of the law, forasmuch as the perpetuity of the law is grounded in Christ. I come now unto the second member, where Peter placeth the cleanness [purity] of the Gentiles in faith. Why doth not he say, In perfection of virtues, or holiness of life, save only because men have righteousness from another, and not from themselves? For, if men, by living well and justly, should purchase righteousness, or if they should be clean before God by nature, this sentence of Peter 			 should fall to the ground. Therefore, the Spirit doth in these words plainly pronounce that all mankind is polluted, and with filthiness defiled; secondly, that their blots can by no other means be wiped away than by the grace of Christ. For, seeing that faith is the remedy whereby the Lord doth freely help us, it is set as well against the common nature of all men, as against every man&#8217;s own merits. When I say that all mankind is polluted, my meaning is, that we bring nothing from our mother&#8217;s 			 womb but mere filthiness, and that there is no righteousness in our nature which can reconcile us to God. Man&#8217;s soul was indeed endued with singular gifts at the first; but all parts thereof are so corrupt with sin, that there remaineth in it no drop of pureness any longer; therefore we must seek for cleanness without ourselves.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p30"></A>For if any man allege that it may be recovered by merits of works, there is nothing more absurd than to imagine that wicked and coward nature can deserve anything. Therefore, it resteth that men seek elsewhere for that which they shall never be able to find within themselves. And surely it is the office of faith to translate that unto us which is proper to Christ, and to make it ours by free participation. So that there is a mutual relation 			 between faith and the grace of Christ. For faith doth not make us clean, as a virtue or quality poured into our souls; but because it receiveth that cleanness which is offered in Christ. We must also note the phrase, that God purifieth the hearts; whereby Luke doth both make God the author of faith, and he teacheth also that cleanness is his benefit. To make short, he signifieth unto us, that that is given to men by the grace of God which they cannot give to themselves. But forasmuch as we said 			 that faith taketh that of Christ which it transpoureth [transferreth] into us; we must now see how the grace of Christ doth make us clean, that we may please God. And there is a double manner of purging, because Christ doth offer and present us clean and just in the sight of his Father, by putting away our sins daily, which he hath once purged by his blood; secondly, because, by mortifying the lusts of the flesh by his Spirit, he reformeth us unto holiness of life. I do willingly comprehend 			 both kinds of purging under these words; because Luke doth not touch one kind of purging only, but he teacheth that the whole perfection thereof consisteth without the ceremonies of the law.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.ii-p31"></A><a name="iii.ii-p31.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p32"></A><b>10.</b><i> Now, therefore, why tempt ye?</i> This is the other part of the sermon wherein Peter showeth how deadly that doctrine is which Paul&#8217;s enemies sought to bring in; to wit, which might drown godly souls in despair. He inferreth and gathereth out of the former member, that God is tempted if the Gentiles be enforced 			 to keep the law of necessity;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">104</FONT></A>
 			  he riseth higher, and pierceth even unto the very fountain. For he reasoneth hitherto, that the Gentiles should have injury done them if there be more required at their hands than God will; and seeing that he made them equal with the holy people, and did vouchsafe them the honor of adoption, it was. an unmeet and inconvenient [absurd] matter that they should be rejected, and so his liberality should be restrained. For he saith last of all, that this faith is 			 sufficient for them, though they want ceremonies. And now he taketh an higher principle, that those who tie men&#8217;s salvation to the works of the law leave them no good hope; but rather throw the whole world headlong into horrible destruction, if it can obtain salvation by no other means but by keeping the law. With what arguments he proveth this we shall see in their place. As touching the words, seeing the Scripture saith, that God is tempted diverse ways, Peter&#8217;s meaning is, in this place, 			 that God is provoked as it were of set purpose, when there is an heavier burden laid upon men than they be able to bear; and that his power is brought within bounds   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">105</FONT></A>
 			  when that yoke is bound which he doth loose, which is nothing else but by striving against nature to match ourselves with giants, as they say.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p35"></A><i>That the yoke should be laid upon their necks.</i> The meaning of the words is plain, that God is tempted when there is laid upon men&#8217;s consciences a sorer burden than they are able to bear, and by this means the salvation of men&#8217;s souls is sore shaken; seeing that they must needs by this means be drowned in despair, which cannot be 			 without their destruction. But that injury which is done to God is no whit more tolerable, when as he is robbed of his right that he may not have liberty to deliver us. But we may easily gather out of the thing itself that he doth not speak of the ceremonies only. The servitude of the old training up under the law was hard and laborious; but yet it were too absurd to call it a yoke that cannot be borne; and we know that not only holy men, but also even most hypocrites, did well and exactly 			 accomplish the outward observation of the rites.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p36"></A>Moreover, it were not any hard matter to satisfy the moral law, if it were content with corporeal obedience only, and did not require spiritual righteousness; for it is granted to many to bridle their hands and feet; but to moderate all the affections so that there may reign perfect abstinence and purity, as well in the soul as in the body, this is too hard a matter.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p37"></A>Therefore, those be too foolish who restrain unto ceremonies Peter&#8217;s words, whereby the weakness of men to perform the righteousness of the heart is expressed; which doth not only far pass their strength, but is altogether contrary to nature. These men were, I warrant you, deceived by one reason, because the question was moved concerning ceremonies only; but they do remember that Peter did more attentively and more wisely consider as became 			 him, what a labyrinth this error (to look to, but light) did bring with it. The false apostles did avouch, that no man could attain unto salvation unless he did keep the ceremonies. If man&#8217;s salvation be tied to works, it shall be no longer grounded in the grace of Christ, and so, by this means, free reconciliation shall fall flat to the ground. Now, seeing that man&#8217;s strength is unable to keep the law, all men are subject to the curse which the Lord there denounceth against the transgressors; 			 and so, by this means, all men shall come in danger of despair, seeing that they see themselves guilty of eternal death by the law. Peradventure the false apostles understood these things craftily. But Peter pierceth the very fountain, that he may bring to light the deadly poison of that doctrine; and thus must we do, so often as Satan doth craftily thrust in wicked errors.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p38"></A>At this day we seem to some to be too contentious, when as we do so stoutly stand in this, that men must not pray for the dead; for it is both a most ancient custom, neither is it a thing to look to very dangerous, though men pour out superfluous prayer; yet [nay] it is a plausible opinion, because it carrieth some color of human godliness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p39"></A>Furthermore, unskillful men judge thus, because they seek. not out the head spring. For, if we grant that men may pray for the dead, we must also admit this, that they are now punished by the judgment of God, because they made not satisfaction in this life for their sins. And so, by this means the force of Christ&#8217;s satisfaction is translated unto the works of men. Secondly, the rule of praying aright is overthrown, if men may pray at all 			 adventure, without the word of God. This is also a greater absurdity than that we ought lightly to pass over it. In sum, we can never give true judgment of any question, unless, having thoroughly ripped up the fountain of that doctrine which is called in question, we deduct all consequences which it bringeth with it. Therefore, it is no marvel if Peter, to the end he may pull the false apostles out (by the ears,) as it were out of their lurking dens, do generally dispute touching the whole law; 			 because he doth nothing else but open the matter itself, whereof the simple were ignorant; that they may all see what a deadly doctrine it is, which doth both extinguish the grace of Christ, and drown souls in the horrible dungeon of despair.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">106</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p41"></A><i>Neither we nor our fathers.</i> Peter doth not only dispute what men have done indeed, but what they were able to do; neither doth he speak only of the common riff-raff,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">107</FONT></A>
 			  but of the holy fathers. Seeing that he denieth that they were able to bear the yoke of the law, it is manifest that the law cannot possibly be kept. I know that Jerome&#8217;s saying is so generally received, that it is, as it were, an undoubted and most certain maxim, If any man say that it is a thing impossible to keep the law, let him be accursed; but we must not hearken to any voice of man which is contrary to the judgment of the Spirit of God. We hear what the 			 Spirit pronounceth in this place by the mouth of Peter, not concerning the will and works of men, but touching their ability and power. And hereunto agreeth Paul, affirming that it was an impossible thing that the law should give us life, forasmuch as it was weak through the flesh. Indeed, if any man were able to fulfill the law, he should find the life which is there promised; but forasmuch as Paul denieth that life can be gotten by the law, it followeth that there is farther and higher 			 righteousness required there than man is able to perform. I confess, indeed, that Jerome doth not wholly grant to the strength of nature power to fulfill the law, but partly also to the grace of God, as he doth afterward expound himself, that a faithful man, holpen by the grace of the Spirit, may be said to be able to fulfill the law. But even that mitigation is not true. For, if we do weigh the strength of nature only, men shall not only be unable to bear the yoke of the law, but they shall 			 not be able to move so much as a finger to perform the least jot of the law. And surely if that be true, that all the cogitations of man&#8217;s mind are wicked from his childhood, (<a name="iii.ii-p42.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021">Ge 8:21</a><a name="iii.ii-p42.2"></A>;) that all the understandings of flesh   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">108</FONT></A>
 			  are enemies to God, (<a name="iii.ii-p43.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#007">Ro 8:7</a><a name="iii.ii-p43.2"></A>;) that there is none which seeketh after God, (<a name="iii.ii-p43.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003">Ps 14:3</a><a name="iii.ii-p43.3"></A>;) and other such places, which are common in the Scripture, tending to the same end, but especially which are cited by Paul in the third to the Romans, 			 (<a name="iii.ii-p43.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#011">Ro 3:11</a><a name="iii.ii-p43.4"></A>,) man&#8217;s power and ability to fulfill the law shall not only be weak and lame, but altogether none to begin.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">109</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p45"></A>Therefore, we must thus think, that even the very faithful, after they being regenerate by the Spirit of God, do study to attain unto the righteousness of the law, do perform, notwithstanding, but the half, and far less than half, not the whole. For doubtless Peter speaketh not in this place of the epicure  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">110</FONT></A>
 			 or profane men; but of Abraham, of Moses, and of other holy fathers which were the most perfect in the world; and yet he saith that these fainted under the burden of the law, because it did pass their strength. It is hatefully objected that the Spirit of God is blasphemed when as ability to fulfill the law is taken away from his grace and help; but we may readily answer, because the question is not what the grace of the Spirit is able to do, but what that measure of grace is able to 			 do which God doth divide to every one in this life. For we must always consider what God doth promise to do; neither let us unadvisedly ask this question, whether that can be done which he himself doth testify shall never be, and which he will not have done? He promiseth the grace and aid of the Spirit to the faithful, whereby they may be able to resist the lusts of the flesh, and to subdue them; yet shall they not quite abolish and drive them away. He promiseth them grace, whereby they may 			 walk in newness of life; yet shall they not be able to run so swiftly as the law requireth. For he will have them kept under during their whole life, that they may fly to beg pardon. If it be unlawful to separate from the power of God&#8217;s counsel, and the order by him set down, it is a foolish and vain cavil, whereby the adversaries go about to burden us, when as they say that we diminish the power of God; nay rather, they transform God, when they hold that his counsel and purpose can be 			 altered.</p>

 			 Augustine. He answereth, that though it be a thing possible that the law should be fulfilled, yet is that sufficient for him, that no man did ever fulfill it, and that the Scripture doth not testify that it shall be fulfilled until the end of the world. By which words he delivereth himself from their importunate subtlety. But there was no cause why he should doubt, but freely and flatly grant that it might be fulfilled, the Holy Ghost being the author. For we must limit the grace of 			 the Spirit, that it may agree with the promises. Furthermore, we have already declared how far the promises reach. There is no man which moveth any question concerning this, whether God be not able if he will to make men perfect; but they dote foolish which separate his power from his counsel, whereof they have an evident and plain testimony in the Scripture. God doth plainly declare a hundred times what he will, and what he hath determined to do: to go any farther is sacrilege.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p49"></A>Jerome was enforced by reason of philosophy to hurl out the thunderbolt of his curse against Peter and Paul;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">112</FONT></A>
 			 because the laws must be applied unto their hability for whom they be appointed; which, as I confess to take place in man&#8217;s laws, so I utterly deny that it is good as touching the law of God, which, in exacting righteousness, doth not respect what man is able to do, but what he ought to do.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p51"></A>Though here ariseth a harder question, &#8220;Whether the law were not given to this end, that it might enforce men to obey God? And this should be in vain, unless the Spirit of God should direct the faithful to keep it; and that the solemn protestation of Moses seemeth to put the matter out of doubt, when he saith that he giveth precepts to the Jews, not such as they may read, but indeed fulfill, (<a name="iii.ii-p51.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#012">De 30:12</a><a name="iii.ii-p51.1"></A>;) whence we gather that the yoke was laid upon the neck of the Jews when the law was given, that it might make them subject to God, that they might not live as them lusted.&#8221; I answer, that the law is counted a yoke two ways. For, inasmuch as it bridleth the lusts of the flesh and delivereth a rule of godly and holy life, it is meet that the children of God take this yoke upon them; but, inasmuch as it doth exactly 			 prescribe what we owe to God, and doth not promise life without adding the condition of perfect obedience, and doth again denounce a curse if we shall in any point offend, it is a yoke which no man is able to bear. I will show this more plainly.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p52"></A>The plain doctrine of good life, wherein God doth invite us unto himself, is a yoke which we must all of us willingly take up; for there is nothing more absurd than that God should not govern man&#8217;s life, but that he should wander at pleasure without any bridle. Therefore, we must not refuse the yoke of the law, if the simple doctrine thereof be considered. But these sayings do otherwise qualify (that I may so term it) the law.</p>

<p><a name="iii.ii-p57"></A>For, so long as salvation is promised to the perfect keeping of the law alone, and every transgression is called into judgment, mankind is utterly undone. In this respect doth Peter affirm that God is tempted, when man&#8217;s arrogance doth burden the consciences of men with the law; for it is not his purpose to deny but that men must be governed by the doctrine of the law, and so he granteth that they be under the law  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">113</FONT></A>
 			 not simply  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">114</FONT></A>
 			 to teach, but also to humble men with the guilt of eternal death. Considering that that quality was annexed unto doctrine, he affirmeth that the souls of the godly must not be tied with the yoke of the law, because by this means it should of necessity come to pass that they should be drowned in eternal destruction. But, when as not only the grace of the Holy Spirit is present to govern us, but also free forgiveness of sins to deliver and acquit us from the curse of the law; then is 			 that of Moses fulfilled, that the commandment is not above us, (<a name="iii.ii-p59.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#011">De 30:11</a><a name="iii.ii-p59.2"></A>;) and then do we also perceive how sweet the yoke of Christ is, and how light his burden is, (<a name="iii.ii-p59.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030">Mt 11:30</a><a name="iii.ii-p59.3"></A>.)

 			 take upon us that which he enjoineth us. Wherefore, so that the rigor of the law be taken away, the doctrine of the law shall not only be tolerable, but also joyful and pleasant; neither must we refuse the bridle which doth govern us mildly, and cloth not urge us sorer than is expedient.</p>

<p><a name="iii.ii-p62"></A><b>11.</b><i> By the grace of Jesus Christ.</i> Peter compareth these two together as contrary the one to the other; to have hope   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">116</FONT></A>
 			  in the grace of Christ, and to be under the yoke of the law; which comparison doth greatly set out the justification of Christ, inasmuch as we gather thereby, that those are justified by faith who, being free and quit from the yoke of the law, seek for salvation in the grace of Jesus Christ. Furthermore, I said before that the yoke of the law is made of two cords. The former is, &#8220;He which doth these things shall live in them;&#8221; the other is, &#8220;Cursed is every one which doth not continue in all the commandments.&#8221; Let us return unto the contrary member. If we cannot otherwise attain unto salvation by the grace of Christ, unless the yoke of the law be taken away, it followeth that salvation is not placed in keeping the law, neither are those which believe in Christ subject to the curse of the law; for if he could be saved through grace, who is as yet enwrapped in the yoke of the law, then should Peter&#8217;s 			 reasoning be but foolish, which is drawn from contraries: thus, We hope for salvation by the grace of Christ; therefore we are not under the yoke of the law. Unless there were a disagreement between the grace of Christ and the yoke of the law, Peter should deceive us.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">117</FONT></A>

 			 who say that we are justified by the grace of Christ, because he regenerateth us by his Spirit, and giveth us strength to fulfill the law. Those who imagine this, though they seem to ease the yoke of the law a little, yet they keep souls bound with the cords thereof. For this promise shall always stand in force, He which shall do these things shall live in them; on the other side, The curse shall come upon all which shall not absolutely fulfill the law. Wherefore, we must define the 			 grace of Christ far otherwise (whereunto the hope of salvation leaneth) than they dream; to wit, that it be free reconciliation gotten by the sacrifice of his death; or, which is all one, free forgiveness of sins, which, by pacifying and appeasing God, doth make him of an enemy or severe judge,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">119</FONT></A>
 			 and which cannot be pleased nor entreated, a merciful Father. I confess, indeed, that we be regenerate into newness of life by the grace of Christ; but when we are about assurance of salvation, then must we call to mind the free adoption alone, which is joined with the purging [expiation] and forgiveness of sins. For, if works be admitted, that they may make us righteous in part only, the yoke of the law shall not be broken, and so Peter&#8217;s contrariety [antithesis] shall fall to the 			 ground, or else be dissolved.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p69"></A><i>Even as they.</i> Peter doth testify in this place, that though the servitude of the law were laid upon the fathers as touching the external shoe, yet were their consciences free and quit; whereby is put away that absurdity, which might otherwise have troubled godly minds not a little. For, seeing that the covenant of life is eternal, and 			 the same which God made with his servants from the beginning until the end of the world, it were an absurd thing, and intolerable, that any other way to obtain salvation should be taught at this day than that which the fathers had in times past. Therefore, Peter affirmeth that we agree very well with the fathers, because they no less than we reposed hope of salvation in the grace of Christ; and so, reconciling the law and the gospel together, as touching the end of the doctrine, he taketh from 			 the Jews the stumbling-block which they reigned to themselves by reason of the discord.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.ii-p70"></A>Whereby it appeareth that the law was not given to the fathers that they might thereby purchase salvation, neither were the ceremonies added, that, by the observing thereof, they might attain unto righteousness; but this was the only end of all the whole law, that, casting from them all confidence which they might repose in works, they might repose all their hope in the grace of Christ. Whereby is also refuted the doting of those who think 			 that the old people, inasmuch as they were content with earthly goods, did think no whit of the heavenly life. But Peter maketh the fathers partners with us of the same faith; and doth make salvation common to both; and yet there be some which delight in that brain-sick fellow, Servetus, with his so filthy sacrileges. Furthermore, we must note that Peter teacheth that the faith of the fathers [ancients] was always grounded in Christ, seeing that they could neither find life anywhere else, 			 neither was there any other way for men to come unto God.

The disputation was hot before; but now, after that Peter hath laid open the counsel of God, and hath handled the question according 			 to the doctrine of the Scripture, by and by all noise being stayed, they are quiet and whist who did of late unadvisedly defend the error. This is a lively image of a lawful Council, when the truth of God alone, so soon as it is once come to light, maketh an end of all controversies; and assuredly it is effectual enough to appease all discord when the Spirit beareth the chief sway; because he is again a fit governor, as well to moderate their tongues who must speak before others as to keep the 			 rest under obedience, that they be not too much addicted to themselves and wedded to their own wills, but that, laying away stubbornness, they may show themselves obedient to God. Neither is it to be doubted but that there was some few which would not yield, as it falleth out in a great assembly; yet the truth of God had the upper hand, so that the silence whereof Luke speaketh was a manifest testimony of common obedience. And this was no small moderation in Peter, in that having suffered every 			 one to say for himself what he could, he deferred his judgment (lest it should be prejudicial to others) so long, until the question had been thoroughly discussed to and fro.</p>

<p><a name="iii.iii-p8"></A><b>13.</b> <i>James answered, saying.</i> Some old writers of the Church think that this James was one of the disciples, whose surname was Justus and Oblia, whose cruel death is recorded by Josephus in the Twentieth Book of his Antiquities. But would to God the old writers had travailed rather to 			 know the man, than to set forth, with reigned praises, the holiness of a man whom they knew not. It is a childish toy and surmise, in that they say that it was lawful for him alone to enter into the most holy place. For if in that entering in there had been any religion, he had done it contrary to the law of God, forasmuch as he was not the highest priest. Secondly, it was a superstitious thing thus to foster the shadowish worship of the Temple. I omit other trifles. And they are greatly 			 deceived in that they deny that he was one of the twelve apostles. For they are enforced to confess that it is he whom Paul commandeth so honorably, that he maketh him the chief among the three pillars of the Church, (<a name="iii.iii-p8.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009">Ga 2:9</a><a name="iii.iii-p8.1"></A>.) Assuredly, a man inferior in order and degree could never have excelled the apostles so far; for Paul 			 giveth him the title of an apostle. Neither is that worth the hearing which Jerome bringeth, [viz.] that the word is general there, seeing that the dignity of the order is there handled; forasmuch as Christ did prefer the apostles before other teachers of the Church.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.iii-p9"></A>Moreover, we may gather out of this place, that they made no small account of James, (<a name="iii.iii-p9.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018">Ac 21:18</a><a name="iii.iii-p9.1"></A>;) forasmuch as he doth with his voice and consent so confirm the words of Peter, that they are all of his mind. And we shall see afterwards how great his authority was at Jerusalem. The old writers think that this was because he was bishop of the place; but it is 			 not to be thought that the faithful did at their pleasure change the order which Christ had appointed. Wherefore, I do not doubt but that he was son to Alpheus, and Christ&#8217;s cousin, in which sense he is also called his brother. Whether he were bishop of Jerusalem or no, I leave it indifferent; neither doth it greatly make for the matter, save only because the impudency of the Pope is hereby refuted, because the decree of the Council is set down rather at the appointment, and according to the 			 authority of James than of Peter. And assuredly Eusebius, in the beginning of his Second Book, is not afraid to call James, whosoever he were, the Bishop of the Apostles. Let the men of Rome go now and boast that their Pope is head of the Universal Church, because he is Peter&#8217;s successor, who suffered another to rule him,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">120</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii-p11"></A><i>Men and brethren, hear me. </i>James&#8217; oration consisteth upon [of] two principal members; for, first, he confirmeth and proveth the calling of the Gentiles by the testimony of the prophet Amos; secondly, he showeth what is best to be done to nourish peace and concord among the faithful; yet so that the liberty of the Gentiles may continue safe and sound, and 			 that the grace of Christ may not be darkened. Whereas Peter is in this place called Simeon, it may be that this name was diversely pronounced then. Whereas he saith that God did visit to take a people of the Gentiles, it is referred unto the mercy of God, whereby he vouchsafed to receive strangers into his family. It is, indeed, a harsh phrase, yet such as containeth a profitable doctrine; because he maketh God the author of the calling of the Gentiles, and pronounceth that it is through his 			 goodness that they began to be reckoned among his people, when he saith that they were taken by him; but he proceedeth further, when he saith that he did visit that he might take. For this is his meaning, That at such time as the Gentiles were turned away from God he did mercifully look upon them; because we can do nothing but depart farther and farther from him, until such time as his fatherly look prevent us of his own accord.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.iii-p12"></A><i>In his name.</i> The old interpreter hath, To his name, which is almost all one, though the preposition, it may be otherwise translated, to wit, For his name, or Upon his name.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">121</FONT></A>
 			  Neither shall the sense disagree, that the salvation of the Gentiles is grounded in the power or name of God, and that God did respect no other thing in calling them but his own glory; yet did I retain that which is more usual; to wit, that, in numbering them among his people, he would have them counted in his name, like as it shall be said shortly after, that his name is called upon by all those whom he gathereth together into his Church. The adverb of time, 			 <a name="iii.iii-p13.2"></A>&#960;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#957;, may be expounded two ways; if you read it, first, as the old interpreter and Erasmus have it, the sense shall be, that Cornelius and others were, as it were, the first fruits at whom God began the calling of the Gentiles; but it may be taken also comparatively, because there was already some token of the adoption of the Gentiles showed in Cornelius and his cousins, before that Barnabas and 			 Paul preached the gospel to the Gentiles.

<p><a name="iii.iii-p15"></A><b>15.</b> <i>Hereto agree the words of the prophets.</i> We see now how the apostles took nothing to themselves imperiously, but did reverently follow that which was prescribed in the word of God. Neither did it grieve them, neither did they count it any disgrace to them to profess themselves to 			 be the scholars of the Scripture. Also we must here note, that the use of the doctrine of the prophets is yet in force, which some brain-sick men would banish out of the Church. By citing the prophets, in the plural number, to be witnesses, whereas he doth allege one place only, he signifieth that there is such an agreement among them, that that which is spoken by one is the common testimony of them all, because they speak all with one mouth, and every one speaketh as in the person of all, or 			 rather the Spirit of God speaketh in them all. Moreover, the oracles of all the prophets were gathered together, that they might make one body. Wherefore that might worthily and fitly be ascribed to all the prophets in general, which was taken out of some one part of the general book.</p>

<p><a name="iii.iii-p17"></A><b>16.</b> <i>After these things I will return.</i> Because the place is not cited word for word as it is in the prophet, we must see what difference there is, though it be not necessary to examine straitly what diversity there is in the words, so it appear that the prophecy doth fitly agree with 			 the matter which is in hand. After that God hath promised the restoring of the tabernacle of David, he saith also, that he will bring to pass that the Jews shall possess the remnants of Edom. In all that text, there appeareth nothing as yet whence the calling of the Gentiles can be fet   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">122</FONT></A>
 			  or gathered; but that which followeth immediately after in the prophet, concerning the remnant of the Gentiles which shall call upon the name of the Lord, doth plainly show that the Jews and Gentiles shall make one Church, because that which was then proper to the Jews alone is given to both in general. For God placeth the Gentiles in like degree of honor with the Jews, when he will have them to call upon his name. Those of Idumea, and the people thereabout, were in 			 times past under David subject to the Jews; but though they were tributaries to the people of God, yet were they nevertheless strangers from the Church. Therefore, this was news and a strange thing, in that God reckoneth them up with the holy people, that he may be called   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">123</FONT></A>
 			  the God of them all; seeing that it is certain that they are all made equal in honor among themselves by this means. Whereby it doth plainly appear how well the testimony of the prophet agreeth with the present purpose. For God promiseth to restore the decayed tabernacle, wherein the Gentiles shall obey the kingdom of David, not only that they may pay tribute, or take [to arms] weapon at the king&#8217;s commandment, but that they may have one God, and that they may be 			 one family to him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.iii-p20"></A>Yet there may a question be moved, why he had rather cite this prophecy, than many other which contain more plentiful proof of the matter which he hath in hand, of which sort Paul citeth many? (<a name="iii.iii-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009">Rom. 15:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#010">10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#011">11</a><a name="iii.iii-p20.1"></A>.) I answer, first, that the apostles were not ambitious in 			 heaping up places of Scripture; but they did simply aim at this, which was sufficient for them, to wit, that they might prove that their doctrine was taken out of the word of God; secondly, I say that this prophecy of Amos is more plain than it is commonly taken to be. The prophet intreateth of the restoring of an house which was decayed;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="#fn_123"><FONT SIZE="1">124</FONT></A>
 			  he describeth the miserable ruin thereof. Therefore, the promise, which is added immediately, that the seat and throne shall be set up again, from of which kings of the posterity of David shall rule over the Gentiles, doth properly appertain unto Christ. Therefore, so soon as the kingdom of Christ is set up, that must needs follow which the prophet saith also, that the Gentiles shall call upon the name of God. Now, we see that James did not unadvisedly make choice 			 of this place; for if the kingdom of Christ cannot be otherwise established, unless God be called upon everywhere throughout the whole world, and the Gentiles grow together to be one with his holy people, it is an absurd thing that they should be driven from hope of salvation, and the middle wall must fall to the ground, wherewith the one was separate from the other under the law,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">125</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii-p23"></A><i>The tabernacle of David, which was decayed.</i> It is not without cause that that evil-favored wasteness and ruin of the king&#8217;s house is set before our eyes by the prophet; for unless the godly should have been persuaded that Christ should notwithstanding come, though the kingdom of David were brought to nought, who should not only 			 restore to their old order things which were decayed, but should exalt even unto the heavens the glory of his kingdom with incomparable success, they should have despaired a hundred times in a day. After they were returned from the exile wherein they lived at Babylon, they were brought by continual destructions almost unto utter destruction. Afterward that which remained was consumed by little and little with civil   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">126</FONT></A>
 			  discord, yea, when God did relieve their miseries, that kind of help which they had was a certain matter of despair;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">127</FONT></A>

And it is to be thought that Luke did summarily comprehend those things whereof James did dispute in his own language among the Jews; whereby it came to pass that the exposition of the matter was mixed with the words of the prophet. Instead of the <i>relics of the Gentiles </i>which Amos useth, Luke, out of the 			 Greek translation, (which was more familiar,) putteth the <i>rest of the men </i>in the same sense, to wit, that there must go before the purging of the filthiness of the world a cutting, or paring, as it came to pass. And this doctrine must be also applied unto our time. For, because the corruption of the world is worse than that it can be wholly brought to obey Christ, he bloweth away, with diverse fans of tribulations, the chaff and weeds, that he 			 may at length gather unto himself that which shall remain.</p>

 			  to put away the hatred which might have risen upon the novelty; for the sudden change might have been suspected, and therefore did it trouble weak minds. Therefore James preventeth, showing that this was no new thing with God, though it fell out suddenly otherwise than men thought; because God saw, before the world was created, what he would do, and the calling of the Gentiles was hidden in his secret counsel. Whereupon it followeth, that it must not be esteemed 			 according to the sense of man. Furthermore, James hath respect unto the words of the prophet, when he affirmeth that God, who should do all these things, was also the author of the prophecy.

The answer is easy, 			 which I will hereafter more at large prosecute. First, he requireth nothing at their hands but that which they were bound to do by brotherly concord; secondly, these precepts could no whir trouble or disquiet their consciences, after that they knew that they were free before God, and that false and perverse religion was taken away, which the false apostles sought to bring in. The question is now, why James doth enjoin the Gentiles these four things alone? Some say that this was let [derived] 			 from the ancient custom of the fathers, who did not make any covenant   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">136</FONT></A>
 			  with any people which they could enforce to obey them but upon this condition; but because there is no fit author of that thing brought to light, I leave it in doubt and undecided.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iv-p7"></A><a name="iii.iv-p7.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.iv-p8"></A>But here appeareth a manifest reason why they gave particular commandment concerning things offered to idols, blood, and that which was strangled. They were, indeed, of themselves things indifferent; yet such as had some special thing in them more than other rites of the law. We know how straitly the Lord commandeth to eschew those things which are contrary to the external profession of faith, and wherein there is any appearance or suspicion 			 of idolatry. Therefore, lest there should any blot of superstition remain in the Gentiles, and lest the Jews should see anything in them which did not agree with the pure worship of God, no marvel if, to avoid offense, they be commanded to abstain from things offered to idols.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.iv-p9"></A>The word <a name="iii.iv-p9.1"></A>&#945;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#947;&#951;&#956;&#945;, which Luke useth, doth signify all manner of profanation; therefore I have not changed the common translation, which hath pollution or filthiness. Yet it is sometimes taken for sacrifices; which sense should not disagree with James&#8217; purpose; and, peradventure, it shall be more plain and natural so to expound it 			 in this place; because, where Luke doth shortly after repeat the same decree, he will put <a name="iii.iv-p9.2"></A>&#949;&#953;&#948;&#969;&#955;&#959;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#945;<i>, </i>or things sacrificed to idols.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.iv-p10"></A>As concerning blood and that which was strangled, not only the Jews were forbidden by the law of Moses to eat them, (<a name="iii.iv-p10.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#023">De 12:23</a><a name="iii.iv-p10.1"></A>;) but this law was given to all the world after the flood, (<a name="iii.iv-p10.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#004">Ge 9:4</a><a name="iii.iv-p10.2"></A>,) whereby it came to pass, that those which were not quite grown 			 out of kind  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">137</FONT></A>
 			 did loathe blood. I do not speak of the Jews, but of many of the Gentiles. I confess, indeed, that even that commandment was but temporal; yet, notwithstanding, it was extended farther than unto one people. No marvel, therefore, if there might arise greater offense thereupon, which to cure seemed good to the apostles. But there ariseth a harder question concerning fornication; because James seemeth to reckon the same among things indifferent, whereof they must beware only in respect 			 of offense; but there was another cause for which he placed fornication among those things which were not of themselves unlawful. It is well known what unbridled liberty to run awhoring did reign and rage everywhere; and this disease had got the upper hand principally among the men of the east country, as they be more given to lust. Assuredly the faith and chastity of wedlock was never less observed and kept any where than among them. Moreover, he doth not intreat indifferently, in my judgment, 			 in this place of all manner [of] fornication or whoredom, as of adultery, and wandering, and unbridled lusts, whereby all chastity is violate and corrupt; but I think he speaketh of concubineship, as they call it; which was so common among the Gentiles, that it was almost like to a law.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.iv-p12"></A>Therefore, whereas James reckoneth up a common corruption among things which are of themselves not corrupt, there is therein no inconvenience;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">138</FONT></A>
 			 so that we know that it was not his meaning to place those things in one order which are very far unlike among themselves. For, whereas unclean men do thereby color and cloak their filthiness, they may easily be refuted. James, say they, coupled eating of blood with whoredom; but doth he compare them together as things that are like, at least which disagree not in any point. Yea, he doth only respect  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">139</FONT></A>
 			 the wicked and corrupt custom of men, which was fallen away from the first law and order of nature appointed by God. As concerning the judgment of God, the knowledge thereof must be let [sought] out of the continual doctrine of the Scripture; and it is nothing doubtful what the Scripture saith; to wit, that whoredom is accursed before God, and that the soul and body are thereby defiled, that the holy temple of God is polluted, and Christ is rent in pieces; that God doth daily punish 			 whoremongers, and that he will once pay them home.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">140</FONT></A>
 			 The filthiness of whoredom, which the heavenly Judge doth so sore condemn, can be covered with no cloaks by the patrons of whoredom how witty and eloquent soever they be.</p>

<p><a name="iii.iv-p17"></A><b>21.</b><i> For Moses hath.</i> This place, in my judgment, hath been badly expounded, and drawn into a contrary sense. For interpreters think that James addeth this, because it were superfluous to prescribe anything to the Jews, who were well acquainted with the doctrine of the law, and to whom it was read every 			 Sabbath-day; and they pick out this meaning, Let us be content to require these few things at the hands of the Gentiles, which are not accustomed to bear the yoke of the law; as touching the Jews they have Moses, out of whom they may learn more. Some do also gather out of this place, that circumcision, with its appurtenances, ought to be observed even at this day among the Jews. But they reason unfitly and unskillfully, though that exposition which I have set down   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">141</FONT></A>
 			  were true. But James had a far other meaning; to wit, he teachers that it cannot be that ceremonies can be abolished so quickly, as it were, at the first dash; because the Jews had now a long time been acquainted with the doctrine of the law, and Moses had his preachers; therefore, it stood them upon to redeem concord for a short thee, until such time as the liberty gotten by Christ might, by little and little, appear more plainly. This is that which is said in the 			 common proverb, That it was meet that the old ceremonies should be buried with some honor. Those who are skillful in the Greek tongue shall know that that last member, When he is read every Sabbath-day in the synagogues, was by me changed not without cause, for avoiding of doubtfulness.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_141"><FONT SIZE="1">142</FONT></A>

For assuredly, this tyranny did spring from the pride of the pastors, that those things which appertain unto the common state of the whole Church are subject (the people being excluded) to the will, will not say lust, of a few. 			   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">143</FONT></A>
 			  We know what a hard matter it is to suppress the slanders of the wicked, to satisfy most men who are churlish and forward, to keep under the light and unskillful, to wipe away errors conceived, to heal up hatred, to appease contentions, [and] to abolish false reports. Peradventure, the enemies of Paul and Barnabas might have said that they had gotten letters by fair and flattering speeches; they might have invented some new cavil; the rude 			 and weak might, by and by, have been troubled; but when chief men come with the letters, that they may gravely dispute the whole matter in presence, all sinister suspicion is taken away.</p>

<p><a name="iii.v-p8"></A><b>24.</b><i> Certain which went out from us.</i> We see that there was no respect of persons among these holy men, which doth always corrupt sound and right judgments. They confess that there were knaves of their own company; and yet they do no whit flatter them, or, through corrupt favor, incline to cover their error; yea, 			 rather in condemning them freely, they spare not even themselves. And, first, they pluck from their faces that visure [mask] which they had abused, to deceive withal. They boasted that they were privy to the meaning of the apostles.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">144</FONT></A>
 			  The apostles reprove them, and condemn them of and for lying in that false pretense, when they utterly deny that they did command any such thing. Again, they accuse them far more sharply, that they troubled the Church and subverted souls. For by this means they bring them in contempt and detestation with the godly, because they cannot be admitted but to their destruction. But false teachers are said to subvert souls, because the truth of God doth edify or build them 			 up, and so this speech containeth a [this] general doctrine, Unless we will willingly have our souls drawn headlong from being any longer temples of the Holy Ghost, and unless we desire their ruin, we must beware of those which go about to lead us away from the pure gospel. That which they say touching the keeping of the law doth only appertain unto ceremonies, though we must always remember, that they did so intreat of ceremonies; that [as if] both the salvation and also the righteousness of 			 men did therein consist. For the false apostles did command that they should be kept, as if righteousness came by the law and salvation did depend upon works.</p>

 			  And, first, to the end they may remove the opinion of disagreement which had possessed the minds of many, they testify their consent; secondly, they commend Paul and Barnabas for their ferventness in zeal and most manlike courage, that they were not afraid to venture or lay down their souls for Christ&#8217;s sake. And this is an excellent virtue in a minister of the gospel, and which deserveth no small praise, if he shall not only be stout and courageous to execute the 			 office of teaching, but also be ready to enter danger which is offered in defense of his doctrine. As the Lord doth thus try the faith and constancy of those which be his, so he doth, as it were, make them noble with the ensigns of virtue, that they may excel in his Church. Therefore, Paul holdeth forth the marks of Christ which he did bear in his body, (<a name="iii.v-p12.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017">Ga 6:17</a><a name="iii.v-p12.2"></A>) as a buckler to 			 drive back those knaves which did trouble his doctrine. And though it do not so fall out with most stout and courageous teachers and preachers of the gospel, that they strive for the gospel until they come in danger of life, because the matter doth not so require, yet is this no let but that Christ may purchase authority for his martyrs, so often as he bringeth them into worthy and renowned conflicts.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.v-p13"></A>Nevertheless, let even those who are not enforced to enter combat by any necessity be ready to shed their blood, if God see it good at any time that it should be so. But the apostles commend the fortitude of Paul and Barnabas only in a good cause; because, if it were sufficient to enter dangers manfully, the martyrs of Christ should nothing differ from troublesome and frenzied men, from cutters and roysters.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">146</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iii.v-p18"></A><b>28.</b><i> It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us.</i> Whereas the apostles and elders match and join themselves with the Holy Ghost, they attribute nothing to themselves apart therein; but this speech importeth as much as if they should say, that the Holy Ghost was the captain, guide, and governor, and that they did 			 set down, and decreed that which they write as he did indite it to them.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_148"><FONT SIZE="1">149</FONT></A>
 			  For this manner of speech is used commonly in the Scripture, to give the ministers the second place after that the name of God is once expressed. When it is said that the people believed God and his servant Moses, (<a name="iii.v-p19.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031">Ex 14:31</a><a name="iii.v-p19.2"></A>,) faith is not rent in pieces, as if it did addict itself partly to God, and partly to mortal man. What then? to wit, whereas the 			 people had God for the sole author of their faith, they believed or gave credence to his minister, from whom he could not be separate. Neither could they otherwise believe God than by believing the doctrine set before them by Moses, as they did shake off the yoke of God after that they had once rejected and despised Moses. Whereby the wickedness of those men is also refuted, who, making boast of faith with full mouth, do no less wickedly than proudly contemn the ministry. For, as it were a 			 sacrilegious partition, if faith should depend even but a very little upon man, so those men do openly mock God who feign that they have him to be their teacher, when they set nought by the ministers by whom he speaketh. Therefore, the apostles deny that they invented that decree of their own brain which they deliver to the Gentiles, but that they were only ministers of the Spirit, that they may, with the authority of God, make them commendable, which (proceeding from him) they do faithfully 			 deliver. So, when Paul maketh mention of his gospel, he doth not enforce upon them a new gospel, which is of his own inventing, but he preacheth that which was committed to him by Christ.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.v-p20"></A>And the Papists are doltish who go about, out of these words, to prove that the Church hath some authority of her own; yea, they are contrary to themselves. For, under what color do they avouch that the Church cannot err, save only because it is grounded immediately by the Holy Spirit? Therefore, they cry out with open mouth, that those things be the oracles of the Spirit which we prove to be their own inventions. Therefore, 			 they do foolishly urge this cause,<i> it seemed good to us;</i> because, if the apostles decreed any thing apart from the Spirit, that principal maxim shall fall to ground, that Councils decree nothing but which is indited by the Spirit.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.v-p21"></A><i>Besides these necessary things.</i> The Papists do forwardly triumph under color of this word, as if it were lawful for men to make laws which may lay necessity upon the conscience. That (say they) which the Church commandeth must be kept under pain of mortal sin, because the apostles say that that must necessarily be observed which they 			 decree. But such a vain cavil is quickly answered. For this necessity reached no farther than there was any danger lest the unity should be cut asunder. So that, to speak properly, this necessity was accidental or external; which was placed not in the thing itself, but only in avoiding of the offense, which appeareth more plainly by abolishing of the decree. For laws made concerning things which are of themselves necessary must be continual. But we 			 know that this law was foredone   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">150</FONT></A>
 			  by Paul so soon as the tumult and contention was once ended, when he teacheth that nothing is unclean, (<a name="iii.v-p22.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#014">Ro 14:14</a><a name="iii.v-p22.2"></A>;) and when he granteth liberty to eat all manner [of] meats, yea, even such as were sacrificed to idols, (<a name="iii.v-p22.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#025">1Co 10:25</a><a name="iii.v-p22.3"></A>.) 			 Wherefore, in vain do they gather any cloak or color out of this word to bind men&#8217;s consciences, seeing that the necessity spoken of in this place did only respect men in the external use lest there should any offense arise thereupon, and that their liberty before God might stand whole and sound. Also, in vain do they gather out of all the whole place, and in vain do they go about out of the same to prove that the Church had power given to decree anything contrary to the word of God. The Pope 			 hath made such laws as seemed best to him, contrary to the word of God, whereby he meant to govern the Church; and that not ten or twenty, but an infinite number, so that they do not only tyrannously oppress souls, but are also cruel torments to vex and torment them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.v-p23"></A>To the end the hired brabblers [wranglers] of the Pope may excuse such cruelty, they do object that even the apostles did forbid the Gentiles that which was not forbidden in the word of God. But I say flatly, that the apostles added nothing unto the word of God; which shall plainly appear if we list to mark their drift. I said of late that they meant nothing less  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_150"></A><A HREF="#fn_150"><FONT SIZE="1">151</FONT></A>
 			 than to set down a perpetual law, whereby they might bind the faithful. What then?

 			 to the Jews. But if we will grant anything, we must assuredly confess that this is according to the word of God, that love bear the sway in things indifferent; that is, that the external use of those things which are of themselves free be bent unto the rule of charity.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.v-p26"></A>In sum, if love be the bond of perfection and end of the law; if God command that we study to preserve mutual unity among ourselves, and that every man serve his neighbor to edify, no man is so ignorant which doth not see that that is contained in the word of God which the apostles command in this place, only they apply a general rule to their time. Furthermore, let us remember that which I said before, that it was a politic law which could 			 not ensnare the conscience, neither bring in any reigned worship of God; which two vices the Scripture condemneth everywhere in men&#8217;s traditions. But admit we should grant (which is most false) that that did not accord with the word of God which was decreed in that council, yet that maketh nothing for the Papists. Let the councils decree anything contrary to [beyond, in addition to] the express word of God, according to the revelation of the Spirit; yet none but lawful councils may have this 			 authority given them. Then let them prove that their councils were godly and holy, to the decrees whereof they will have us subject. But I will not any farther prosecute this point, because it was handled in the beginning of the chapter. Let the readers know (which is sufficient for this present place) that the apostles pass not the bounds of the word of God when they set down an external law, as time requireth, whereby they may reconcile the Churches among themselves.</p>  <a name="iii.vi"></A>

<p><a name="iii.vi-p5"></A><b>30.</b><i> When the multitude was gathered.</i> This was the most lawful kind of dealing to admit the whole multitude unto the reading of the epistle. For if there fall out any controversy in the doctrine of faith, it is meet that the judgment be referred over unto the 			 learned and godly, and to such as are exercised in the Scripture; and, chiefly, to the pastors rightly ordained. Notwithstanding, because it belongeth to all alike to know for a surety what they must hold, the godly and learned teachers must make known   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_152"></A><A HREF="#fn_152"><FONT SIZE="1">153</FONT></A>
 			  to the whole Church what they have set down out of the word of God. For there is nothing more unfitting for holy and Christian order than to drive away the body of the people from common doctrine, as if it were a herd of swine, as they use to do under the tyranny of Popery. For because the Pope and the horned bishops did think that the people would never be obedient enough until they were brought into gross ignorance, they imagined that this was the best summary of 			 faith, to know nothing, but to depend wholly upon their decrees. But, on the contrary, there must be a mean observed, that lawful governments may continue;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_153"></A><A HREF="#fn_153"><FONT SIZE="1">154</FONT></A>

But we must note, that there was no small matter of consolation therein, because, when they knew the consent of the apostles, they were all pacified, 			 and also whereas before there was variance among them, they are now reconciled one to another. Seeing there went a false report about, that all the apostles were against Paul and Barnabas, this same had shaken some who were too light of belief, many did stand in doubt; the wicked abused this occasion to speak evil; others some were pricked forward   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_154"></A><A HREF="#fn_154"><FONT SIZE="1">155</FONT></A>
 			  with love of novelty and with curiosity, and one was set against another. But now, after that they see that the judgment of the first Church doth agree with the doctrine of Paul and Barnabas, they obtain that for which the children of God ought most to wish, that being established in the right faith, and being of one mind among themselves, they may with quiet minds have peace one with another.</p>

Now, Luke showeth some farther things by them done; to wit, that being furnished with the gift of prophecy, they edify the Church in general, as if he should say, they did not only do their duty faithfully in the cause which was now in hand, but they did also take good and profitable pains in teaching and exhorting the Church 			 And we must note that he saith that they exhorted the Church, because they were prophets; for it is not a thing common to all men to enter such an excellent function. Therefore, we must beware, lest any man pass   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_155"></A><A HREF="#fn_155"><FONT SIZE="1">156</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iii.vi-p14"></A><i>They were prophets.</i> Whereas the word hath diverse significations, it is not taken in this place for those prophets to whom it was granted to foretell things to come; because this title should come in out of season   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_156"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">157</FONT></A>
 			  when he intreateth of another matter; but Luke&#8217;s meaning is, that Judas and Silas were endued with excellent knowledge and understanding of the mysteries of God, that they might be good interpreters of God; as Paul, in the fourteenth of the First to the Corinthians, (<a name="iii.vi-p15.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#003">1Co 14:3</a><a name="iii.vi-p15.2"></A>,) when he intreateth of the prophecy, and preferreth it before all 			 other gifts, speaketh not of foretelling of things to come; but he commandeth it for this fruit, because it doth edify the Church by doctrine, exhortation, and consolation. After this manner doth Luke assign exhortation to the prophets, as being the principal point of their office.</p>

And in the text 			 there is a correction added immediately, that it seemed good to Silas to tarry there; but when Luke joineth them both together, his meaning is only to declare that the Church was quiet before they thought upon any returning. At length he addeth that Paul and Barnabas, so long as they were at Antioch, gave themselves to teaching, and did continue in this work,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_157"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">158</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iii.vii-p5"></A><b>36.</b><i> Let us visit our brethren.</i> In this history we must first note how careful Paul was for the churches which he had ordained. He laboreth, indeed, at Antioch profitably, but because he remembered that he was an apostle ordained of God, and not the pastor of one particular place, he keepeth the course of his 			 calling. Secondly, as it did not become him to be tied to one place, so he thinketh with himself, that he was bound to all whom he begat in the Lord; therefore, he will not suffer them to want his help. Moreover, the work that was begun in those places could not be neglected; but it would shortly after decay. Yet it is to be thought that Paul stayed still in the church of Antioch, until he saw the estate thereof well ordered, and concord established. For we know and try   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">162</FONT></A>
 			  what great force principal churches   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">163</FONT></A>
 			  have to keep other lesser churches in order. If there arise any tumult in an obscure street, or if there fall out any offense, the rumor goeth not so far, neither are the neighbors so much moved; but if any place be excellent, it cannot quail without great ruin, or, at least, but that the lesser buildings shall be therewith sore shaken, both far and wide. Therefore, Paul, in staying a time at Antioch, did provide for other churches; and so we must no less look unto 			 his wisdom than his diligence in this example, because oftentimes the immoderate heat of the pastors in going about matters doth no less hurt than their sluggishness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.vii-p8"></A><i>How they do.</i> Paul knew that amidst so great lightness and inconstancy of men, and as their nature is inclined to vice, if there be any thing well ordered among them, it doth seldom continue stable, and for any long time; and especially that churches do easily decay or grow out of kind, unless they be looked to continually. There ought 			 nothing under heaven to be more firm than the spiritual building of faith, whose stability is grounded in the very heaven; yet there be but few in whose minds the word of the Lord doth thoroughly take lively root; therefore, firmness is rare in men. Again, even those who have their anchor firmly fixed in the truth of God, do not cease notwithstanding to be subject to diverse tossings, whereby, though their faith be not overturned, yet hath it need of strengthening, that it may be underpropped 			 and stayed. Moreover, we see how Satan doth assault, and with what subtle shifts he goeth about privily to pull down sometimes whole churches, sometimes every one of the faithful particularly. Therefore, it is not without cause that Paul is so careful for his scholars, lest they behave themselves otherwise than is to be wished; and therefore is he desirous in time to prevent, if there be any inconvenience risen, which cannot be until he have taken view.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">164</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iii.vii-p11"></A><b>37.</b><i> And Barnabas gave counsel.</i> Luke doth here set down that doleful disagreement which ought to make all the godly afraid for just causes. The society of Paul and Barnabas was consecrated by the heavenly oracle. They had long time labored, being of one mind, under this yoke whereunto the Lord had tied them; 			 they had, by many experiences, tried [felt] the excellent favor of God, yea, that wonderful success mentioned heretofore by Luke was a manifest blessing of God. Though they had been almost drowned so often in so many tempests of persecution, and were set upon so sore   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">165</FONT></A>
 			  by infinite enemies, though domestical sedition were everywhere kindled against them, yet they were so far from being pulled in sunder, that their agreement was then most of all tried, [proved.] But now, for a light matter, and which might easily have been ended, they break that holy bond of God&#8217;s calling.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.vii-p13"></A>This could not fall out without great perturbance to all the godly. Seeing that the heat of the contention was so great and vehement in these holy men, who had long time accustomed themselves to suffer all things, what shall befall us, whose affections being not as yet so brought to obey God, do oftentimes rage  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">166</FONT></A>
 			 without modesty? Seeing that a light occasion did separate them, who had long time, amidst so great trials, retained unity holily, how easily may Satan cause those to be divided who have either none, or, at least, a cold desire to foster peace? What great pride was it for Barnabas, who had no more honorable thing than to be Paul&#8217;s companion, that he might behave himself like a son towards his father, so stubbornly to refuse his counsel? Peradventure, also, some might think that Paul 			 was not very courteous in that he did not forgive a faithful helper this fault. Therefore, we be admonished by this example, that unless the servants of Christ take great heed, there be many chinks through which Satan will creep in, to disturb that concord which is among them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.vii-p15"></A>But now we must examine the cause itself, for some there be who lay the blame of the disagreement upon Paul;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">167</FONT></A>
 			 and, at the first hearing, the reasons which they bring seem probable. John Mark is rejected, because he withdrew himself from Paul&#8217;s company; but he fell not away from Christ. A young man, being as yet unacquainted with bearing the cross, returned home from his journey. He was somewhat to be borne with for his age, being a fresh-water soldier [a tyro] he fainted in troubles even at the first dash; he was not, therefore, about to be a slothful soldier during his whole life. Now, 			 forasmuch as his returning to Paul is an excellent testimony of repentance, it seemeth to be a point of discourtesy  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">168</FONT></A>
 			 to reject him; for those must be handled more courteously, who punish themselves for their own offenses of their own accord. There were also other causes which ought to have made Paul more courteous. The house of John Mark was a famous inn,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_168"></A><A HREF="#fn_168"><FONT SIZE="1">169</FONT></A>
 			 (<a name="iii.vii-p18.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012">Ac 12:12</a><a name="iii.vii-p18.2"></A>;) his mother had entertained the faithful in most grievous persecution; when Herod and all the people were in a rage, they were wont to have their secret meetings there, as Luke reported before. Surely he ought to have borne with such a holy and courageous woman, lest immoderate rigor should alienate her. She was desirous to have her son addicted to preach the gospel; now, what a great 			 grief might it have been to her that his pains and industry should be refused  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_169"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">170</FONT></A>
 			 for one light fault? And now whereas John Mark doth not only bewail his fault, but in very deed amend the same, Barnabas hath a fair color why he should pardon him.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">171</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.vii-p21"></A>Yet we may gather out of the text, that the Church did allow Paul&#8217;s counsel. For Barnabas departeth, and with his companion he saileth into Cyprus. There is no mention made of the brethren, (as if he had departed privily without taking his leave;) but the brethren commend Paul in their prayers to the grace of God; whereby appeareth that the Church stood on his side. Secondly, whereas God showeth forth the power of his Spirit in blessing 			 Paul, and doth bless his labors with happy success of his grace, and leaveth Barnabas, as it were, buried, there may a probable reason be drawn thence, that it pleased him that such an example of severity should be showed. And surely the offense of John Mark was greater than it is commonly taken for. He slid not back, indeed, from the faith of Christ, yet did he forsake his calling, and was a revolt [apostate] from the same; therefore, it was a matter which might have given evil example, if he 			 had been straightway received again into the calling from which he was slid back. He had given himself over to serve Christ upon this condition, that he should be free no longer. It was no more lawful for him to break his promise made in this behalf, than it is for a husband to leave his wife, or for a son to forsake his father. Neither doth infirmity excuse his unfaithfulness, whereby the holiness of the calling was violated.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iii.vii-p22"></A>And we must note, that he was not altogether rejected of Paul; he counted him as a brother, so he would be content with the common order; he refused to admit him unto the common [public] function of teaching, from whence he fell filthily through his own fault. And there is no great difference between these two, whether he which hath offended be quite excluded from pardon, or he have only public honor denied him; though it may be that they 			 did both exceed measure, as accidents do oftentimes mar a matter which is otherwise good. It was well done of Paul, and according to the right of discipline profitably, not to admit him to be his companion, whose inconstancy he had once tried, [experienced;] but when he saw Barnabas so importunate, he might have yielded to his desire. We ought to make more account of the truth than of the favor of all the whole world; but it is convenient that we ponder wisely what great weight there is in the 			 matter which is in hand. For if, in a matter of no weight or edification, a man vaunt of his constancy, prepare himself for the conflict, and cease not to defend that until the end, wherein he did once take delight it shall be but foolish and perverse obstinacy. There was also some middle way and means whereby Paul might have granted somewhat to the importunateness of his fellow [colleague] in office, and yet have not revolted from the truth. It was not for him to flatter Mark, or to cloak his 			 offense, yet was he not letted by religion, but that after he had freely professed what he thought, he might suffer himself to be overcome in that matter, which did neither indamage true doctrine, nor endanger man&#8217;s salvation; which I say for this cause, that we may learn to moderate our desire, even in the best causes, lest it pass measure, and be too fervent.</p>
