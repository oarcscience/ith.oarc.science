<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iii.i-p1"></A>The two former Books treated of God the Creator and Redeemer. This Book, which contains a full exposition of the Third Part of the Apostles&#8217; Creed, treats of the mode of procuring the grace of Christ, the benefits which we derive and the effects which follow from it, or of the operations of the Holy Spirit in regard to our salvation.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iii.i-p2"></A>The subject is comprehended under seven principal heads, which almost all point to the same end, namely, the doctrine of faith.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iii.i-p3"></A>I. As it is by the secret and special operation of the Holy Spirit that we enjoy Christ and all his benefits, the First Chapter treats of this operation, which is the foundation of faith, new life, and all holy exercises.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iii.i-p4"></A>II. Faith being, as it were, the hand by which we embrace Christ the Redeemer, offered to us by the Holy Spirit, Faith is fully considered in the Second Chapter.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iii.i-p5"></A>III. In further explanation of Saving Faith, and the benefits derived from it, it is mentioned that true repentance always flows from true faith. The doctrine of Repentance is considered generally in the Third Chapter, Popish Repentance in the Fourth Chapter, Indulgences and Purgatory in the Fifth Chapter. Chapters Sixth to Tenth are devoted to a special consideration of the different parts of true Repentance&#8212;viz. mortification of the flesh, and quickening of the 				Spirit.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iii.i-p6"></A>IV. More clearly to show the utility of this Faith, and the effects resulting from it, the doctrine of Justification by Faith is explained in the Eleventh Chapter, and certain questions connected with it explained from the Twelfth to the Eighteenth Chapter. Christian liberty a kind of accessory to Justification, is considered in the Nineteenth Chapter.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iii.i-p7"></A>V. The Twentieth Chapter is devoted to Prayer, the principal exercise of faith, and, as it were, the medium or instrument through which we daily procure blessings from God.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iii.i-p8"></A>VI. As all do not indiscriminately embrace the fellowship of Christ offered in the Gospel, but those only whom the Lord favors with the effectual and special grace of his Spirit, lest any should impugn this arrangement, Chapters Twenty-First to Twenty-Fourth are occupied with a necessary and apposite discussion of the subject of Election.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iii.i-p9"></A>VII. Lastly, As the hard warfare which the Christian is obliged constantly to wage may have the effect of disheartening him, it is shown how it may be alleviated by meditating on the final resurrection. Hence the subject of the Resurrection is considered in the Twenty-Fifth Chapter.</p>
