<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p3"></A>Sire,&#8212;When I first engaged in this work, nothing was farther from my thoughts than to write what should afterwards be presented to your Majesty. My intention was only to furnish a kind of rudiments, by which those who feel some interest in religion might be trained to true godliness. And I toiled at the task chiefly for the sake of my countrymen the French, multitudes of whom I perceived to be hungering and thirsting after Christ, while very few seemed to have been duly 			 imbued with even a slender knowledge of him. That this was the object which I had in view is apparent from the work itself, which is written in a simple and elementary form adapted for instruction.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p4"></A>But when I perceived that the fury of certain bad men had risen to such a height in your realm, that there was no place in it for sound doctrine, I thought it might be of service if I were in the same work both to give instruction to my countrymen, and also lay before your Majesty a Confession, from which you may learn what the doctrine is that so inflames the rage of those madmen who are this day, with fire and sword, troubling your kingdom. For I fear not to declare, 			 that what I have here given may be regarded as a summary of the very doctrine which, they vociferate, ought to be punished with confiscation, exile, imprisonment, and flames, as well as exterminated by land and sea.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p5"></A>I am aware, indeed, how, in order to render our cause as hateful to your Majesty as possible, they have filled your ears and mind with atrocious insinuations; but you will be pleased, of your clemency, to reflect, that neither in word nor deed could there be any innocence, were it sufficient merely to accuse. When any one, with the view of exciting prejudice, observes that this doctrine, of which I am endeavouring to give your Majesty an account, has been condemned by 			 the suffrages of all the estates, and was long ago stabbed again and again by partial sentences of courts of law, he undoubtedly says nothing more than that it has sometimes been violently oppressed by the power and faction of adversaries, and sometimes fraudulently and insidiously overwhelmed by lies, cavils, and calumny. While a cause is unheard, it is violence to pass sanguinary sentences against it; it is fraud to charge it, contrary to its deserts, with sedition and mischief.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p6"></A>That no one may suppose we are unjust in thus complaining, you yourself, most illustrious Sovereign, can bear us witness with what lying calumnies it is daily traduced in your presence, as aiming at nothing else than to wrest the sceptres of kings out of their hands, to overturn all tribunals and seats of justice, to subvert all order and government, to disturb the peace and quiet of society, to abolish all laws, destroy the distinctions of rank and property, and, in 			 short, turn all things upside down. And yet, that which yon hear is but the smallest portion of what is said; for among the common people are disseminated certain horrible insinuations&#8212;insinuations which, if well founded, would justify the whole world in condemning the doctrine with its authors to a thousand fires and gibbets. Who can wonder that the popular hatred is inflamed against it, when credit is given to those most iniquitous accusations? See, why all ranks unite with one accord in 			 condemning our persons and our doctrine!</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p7"></A>Carried away by this feeling, those who sit in judgment merely give utterance to the prejudices which they have imbibed at home, and think they have duly performed their part if they do not order punishment to be inflicted on any one until convicted, either on his own confession, or on legal evidence. But of what crime convicted? &#8220;Of that condemned doctrine,&#8221; is the answer. But with what justice condemned? The very essence of the defence was, not to abjure the doctrine 			 itself, but to maintain its truth. On this subject, however, not a whisper is allowed!</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p8"></A>Justice, then, most invincible Sovereign, entitles me to demand that you will undertake a thorough investigation of this cause, which has hitherto been tossed about in any kind of way, and handled in the most irregular manner, without any order of law, and with passionate heat rather than judicial gravity.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p9"></A>Let it not be imagined that I am here framing my own private defence, with the view of obtaining a safe return to my native land. Though I cherish towards it the feelings which become me as a man, still, as matters now are, I can be absent from it without regret. The cause which I plead is the common cause of all the godly, and therefore the very cause of Christ&#8212;a cause which, throughout your realm, now lies, as it were, in despair, torn and trampled upon in all kinds of 			 ways, and that more through the tyranny of certain Pharisees than any sanction from yourself. But it matters not to inquire how the thing is done; the fact that it is done cannot be denied. For so far have the wicked prevailed, that the truth of Christ, if not utterly routed and dispersed, lurks as if it were ignobly buried; while the poor Church, either wasted by cruel slaughter or driven into exile, or intimidated and terror&#8212;struck, scarcely ventures to breathe. Still her enemies press on 			 with their wonted rage and fury over the ruins which they have made, strenuously assaulting the wall, which is already giving way. Meanwhile, no man comes forth to offer his protection against such furies. Any who would be thought most favourable to the truth, merely talk of pardoning the error and imprudence of ignorant men For so those modest personages 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#fn_2"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>
 			 speak; giving the name of <i>error and imprudence</i> to that which they know to be 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#fn_3"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>
 			 the infallible truth of God, and of <i>ignorant men</i> to those whose intellect they see that Christ has not despised, seeing he has deigned to intrust them with the mysteries of his heavenly wisdom. 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#fn_4"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>
 			 Thus all are ashamed of the Gospel.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p13"></A>Your duty, most serene Prince, is, not to shut either your ears or mind against a cause involving such mighty interests as these: how the glory of God is to be maintained on the earth inviolate, how the truth of God is to preserve its dignity, how the kingdom of Christ is to continue amongst us compact and secure. The cause is worthy of your ear, worthy of your investigation, worthy of your throne.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p14"></A>The characteristic of a true sovereign is, to acknowledge that, in the administration of his kingdom, he is a minister of God. He who does not make his reign subservient to the divine glory, acts the part not of a king, but a robber. He, moreover, deceives himself who anticipates long prosperity to any kingdom which is not ruled by the sceptre of God, that is, by his divine word. For the heavenly oracle is infallible which has declared, that &#8220;where there is no vision the 			 people perish&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p14.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#018">Prov. 29:18</a><a name="ii.v-p14.1"></A>).</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p15"></A>Let not a contemptuous idea of our insignificance dissuade you from the investigation of this cause. We, indeed, are perfectly conscious how poor and abject we are: in the presence of God we are miserable sinners, and in the sight of men most despised&#8212;we are (if you will) the mere dregs and off&#8212;scoutings of the world, or worse, if worse can be named: so that before God there remains nothing of which we can glory save only his mercy, by which, without any merit of our 			 own, we are admitted to the hope of eternal salvation: 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>
 			 and before men not even this much remains, 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>
 			 since we can glory only in our infirmity, a thing which, in the estimation of men, it is the greatest ignominy even tacitly 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>
 			 to confess. But our doctrine must stand sublime above all the glory of the world, and invincible by all its power, because it is not ours, but that of the living God and his Anointed, whom the Father has appointed King, that he may rule from sea to sea, and from the rivers even to the ends of the earth; and so rule as to smite the whole earth and its strength of iron and brass, its splendour of gold and silver, with the mere rod of his mouth, and break them in pieces like a potter&#8217;s 			 vessel; according to the magnificent predictions of the prophets respecting his kingdom (<a name="ii.v-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034">Dan. 2:34</a><a name="ii.v-p18.1"></A>; <a name="ii.v-p18.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004">Isaiah 11:4</a><a name="ii.v-p18.2"></A>; <a name="ii.v-p18.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009">Psalm 2:9</a><a name="ii.v-p18.3"></A>).</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p19"></A>Our adversaries, indeed, clamorously maintain that our appeal to the word of God is a mere pretext,&#8212;that we are, in fact, its worst corrupters. How far this is not only malicious calumny, but also shameless effrontery, you will be able to decide, of your own knowledge, by reading our Confession. Here, however, it may be necessary to make some observations which may dispose, or at least assist, you to read and study it with attention.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p20"></A>When Paul declared that all prophecy ought to be according to the analogy of faith (<a name="ii.v-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006">Rom. 12:6</a><a name="ii.v-p20.1"></A>), he laid down the surest rule for determining the meaning of Scripture. Let our doctrine be tested by this rule and our victory is secure. For what accords better and more aptly with faith than to acknowledge ourselves divested of all virtue that we may be clothed by God, devoid of all goodness that we may be filled by Him, the slaves of sin that he may give us freedom, blind 			 that he may enlighten, lame that he may cure, and feeble that he may sustain us; to strip ourselves of all ground of glorying that he alone may shine forth glorious, and we be glorified in him? When these things, and others to the same effect, are said by us, they interpose, and querulously complain, that in this way we overturn some blind light of nature, fancied preparatives, free will, and works meritorious of eternal salvation, with their own supererogations also; 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>
 			 because they cannot bear that the entire praise and glory of all goodness, virtue, justice, and wisdom, should remain with God. But we read not of any having been blamed for drinking too much of the fountain of living water; on the contrary, those are severely reprimanded who &#8220;have hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p21.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013">Jer. 2:13</a><a name="ii.v-p21.1"></A>). Again, what more agreeable to faith than to feel assured that God is a propitious Father when Christ is acknowledged as a 			 brother and propitiator, than confidently to expect all prosperity and gladness from Him, whose ineffable love towards us was such that He &#8220;spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p21.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032">Rom. 8:32</a><a name="ii.v-p21.2"></A>), than to rest in the sure hope of salvation and eternal life whenever Christ, in whom such treasures are hid, is conceived to have been given by the Father? Here they attack us, and loudly maintain that this sure confidence is not free from arrogance and presumption. But as nothing is to 			 be presumed of ourselves, so all things are to be presumed of God; nor are we stript of vain&#8212;glory for any other reason than that we may learn to glory in the Lord. Why go farther? Take but a cursory view, most valiant King, of all the parts of our cause, and count us of all wicked men the most iniquitous, if you do not discover plainly, that &#8220;therefore we both labour and suffer reproach because we trust in the living God&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p21.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010">1 Tim. 4:10</a><a name="ii.v-p21.3"></A>); because we believe it to be &#8220;life eternal&#8221; to know &#8220;the 			 only true God, and Jesus Christ,&#8221; whom he has sent (<a name="ii.v-p21.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003">John 17:3</a><a name="ii.v-p21.4"></A>). For this hope some of us are in bonds, some beaten with rods, some made a gazing&#8212;stock, some proscribed, some most cruelly tortured, some obliged to flee; we are all pressed with straits, loaded with dire execrations, lacerated by slanders, and treated with the greatest indignity.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p22"></A>Look now to our adversaries (I mean the priesthood, at whose beck and pleasure others ply their enmity against us), and consider with me for a little by what zeal they are actuated. The true religion which is delivered in the Scriptures, and which all ought to hold, they readily permit both themselves and others to be ignorant of, to neglect and despise; and they deem it of little moment what each man believes concerning God and Christ, or disbelieves, provided he 			 submits to the judgment of the Church with what they call1 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A>
 			 implicit faith; nor are they greatly concerned though they should see the glow of God dishonoured by open blasphemies, provided not a finger is raised against the primacy of the Apostolic See and the authority of holy mother Church.1 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A>
 			 Why, then, do they war for the mass, purgatory, pilgrimage, and similar follies, with such fierceness and acerbity, that though they cannot prove one of them from the word of God, they deny godliness can be safe without faith in these things&#8212;faith drawn out, if I may so express it, to its utmost stretch? Why? just because their belly is their God, and their kitchen their religion; and they believe, that if these were away they would not only not be Christians, but not even men. For 			 although some wallow in luxury, and others feed on slender crusts, still they all live by the same pot, which without that fuel might not only cool, but altogether freeze. He, accordingly, who is most anxious about his stomach, proves the fiercest champion of his faith. In short, the object on which all to a man are bent, is to keep their kingdom safe or their belly filled; not one gives even the smallest sign of sincere zeal.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p25"></A>Nevertheless, they cease not to assail our doctrine, and to accuse and defame it in what terms they may, in order to render it either hated or suspected. They call it new, and of recent birth; they carp at it as doubtful and uncertain; they bid us tell by what miracles it has been confirmed; they ask if it be fair to receive it against the consent of so many holy Fathers and the most ancient custom; they urge us to confess either that it is schismatical in giving battle 			 to the Church, or that the Church must have been without life during the many centuries in which nothing of the kind was heard. Lastly, they say there is little need of argument, for its quality may be known by its fruits, namely, the large number of sects, the many seditious disturbances, and the great licentiousness which it has produced. No doubt, it is a very easy matter for them, in presence of an ignorant and credulous multitude, to insult over an undefended cause; but were an opportunity 			 of mutual discussion afforded, that acrimony which they now pour out upon us in frothy torrents, with as much license as impunity,1 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A>
 			 would assuredly boil dry.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p27"></A>1. First, in calling it new, they are exceedingly injurious to God, whose sacred word deserved not to be charged with novelty. To them, indeed, I very little doubt it is new, as Christ is new, and the Gospel new; but those who are acquainted with the old saying of Paul, that Christ Jesus &#8220;died for our sins, and rose again for our justification&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p27.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025">Rom. 4:25</a><a name="ii.v-p27.1"></A>), will not detect any novelty in us. That it long lay buried and unknown is the guilty consequence of man&#8217;s impiety; 			 but now when, by the kindness of God, it is restored to us, it ought to resume its antiquity just as the returning citizen resumes his rights.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p28"></A>2. It is owing to the same ignorance that they hold it to be doubtful and uncertain; for this is the very thing of which the Lord complains by his prophet, &#8220;The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master&#8217;s crib; but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#003">Isaiah 1:3</a><a name="ii.v-p28.1"></A>). But however they may sport with its uncertainty, had they to seal their own doctrine with their blood, and at the expense of life, it would be seen what value they put upon it. Very different 			 is our confidence&#8212;a confidence which is not appalled by the terrors of death, and therefore not even by the judgment&#8212;seat of God.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p29"></A>3. In demanding miracles from us, they act dishonestly; for we have not coined some new gospel, but retain the very one the truth of which is confirmed by all the miracles which Christ and the apostles ever wrought. But they have a peculiarity which we have not&#8212;they can confirm their faith by constant miracles down to the present day! Way rather, they allege miracles which might produce wavering in minds otherwise well disposed; they are so frivolous and ridiculous, so 			 vain and false. But were they even exceedingly wonderful, they could have no effect against the truth of God, whose name ought to be hallowed always, and everywhere, whether by miracles, or by the natural course of events. The deception would perhaps be more specious if Scripture did not admonish us of the legitimate end and use of miracles. Mark tells us (<a name="ii.v-p29.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#020">Mark 16:20</a><a name="ii.v-p29.1"></A>) that the signs which followed the preaching of the apostles were wrought in confirmation of it; so Luke also relates that the 			 Lord &#8220;gave testimony to the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done&#8221; by the hands of the apostles (<a name="ii.v-p29.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#003">Acts 14:3</a><a name="ii.v-p29.2"></A>). Very much to the same effect are those words of the apostle, that salvation by a preached gospel was confirmed, &#8220;The Lord bearing witness with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p29.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004">Heb. 2:4</a><a name="ii.v-p29.3"></A>). Those things which we are told are seals of the gospel, shall we pervert to the subversion of the gospel? What was destined only to confirm the truth, shall we misapply 			 to the confirmation of lies? The proper course, therefore, is, in the first instance, to ascertain and examine the doctrine which is said by the Evangelist to precede; then after it has been proved, but not till then, it may receive confirmation from miracles. But the mark of sound doctrine given by our Saviour himself is its tendency to promote the glory not of men, but of God (<a name="ii.v-p29.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#018">John 7:18</a><a name="ii.v-p29.4"></A>; 8:50). Our Saviour having declared this to be test of doctrine, we are in error if we regard as 			 miraculous, works which are used for any other purpose than to magnify the name of God.1 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A>
 			 And it becomes us to remember that Satan has his miracles, which, although they are tricks rather than true wonders, are still such as to delude the ignorant and unwary. Magicians and enchanters have always been famous for miracles, and miracles of an astonishing description have given support to idolatry: these, however, do not make us converts to the superstitions either of magicians or idolaters. In old times, too, the Donatists used their power of working miracles as a 			 battering-ram, with which they shook the simplicity of the common people. We now give to our opponents the answer which Augustine then gave to the Donatists (in Joan. Tract. 23), &#8220;The Lord put us on our guard against those wonder&#8212;workers, when he foretold that false prophets would arise, who, by lying signs and divers wonders, would, if it were possible, deceive the very elect&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p30.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024">Mt. 24:24</a><a name="ii.v-p30.1"></A>). Paul, too, gave warning that the reign of antichrist would be &#8220;withall power, and signs, and lying 			 wonders&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p30.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009">2 Thess. 2:9</a><a name="ii.v-p30.2"></A>).</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p31"></A>But our opponents tell us that their miracles are wrought not by idols, not by sorcerers, not by false prophets, but by saints: as if we did not know it to be one of Satan&#8217;s wiles to transform himself &#8220;into an angel of light&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p31.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014">2 Cor. 11:14</a><a name="ii.v-p31.1"></A>). The Egyptians, in whose neighbourhood Jeremiah was buried, anciently sacrificed and paid other divine honours to him (Hieron. in Praef. Jerem). Did they not make an idolatrous abuse of the holy prophet of God? and yet, in recompense 			 for so venerating his tomb, they thought1 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A>
 			 that they were cured of the bite of serpents. What, then, shall we say but that it has been, and always will be, a most just punishment of God, to send on those who do not receive the truth in the love of it, &#8220;strong delusion, that they should believe a lie&#8221;? (<a name="ii.v-p32.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011">2 Thess. 2:11</a><a name="ii.v-p32.1"></A>). We, then, have no lack of miracles, sure miracles, that cannot be gainsaid; but those to which our opponents lay claim are mere delusions of Satan, inasmuch as they draw off the people from the true worship of 			 God to vanity.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p33"></A>4. It is a calumny to represent us as opposed to the Fathers (I mean the ancient writers of a purer age), as if the Fathers were supporters of their impiety. Were the contest to be decided by such authority (to speak in the most moderate terms), the better part of the victory would be ours.1 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A>
 			 While there is much that is admirable and wise in the writings of those Fathers, and while in some things it has fared with them as with ordinary men; these pious sons, forsooth, with the peculiar acuteness of intellect, and judgment, and soul, which belongs to them, adore only their slips and errors, while those things which are well said they either overlook, or disguise, or corrupt; so that it may be truly said their only care has been to gather dross among gold. Then, with 			 dishonest clamour, they assail us as enemies and despisers of the Fathers. So far are we from despising them, that if this were the proper place, it would give us no trouble to support the greater part of the doctrines which we now hold by their suffrages. Still, in studying their writings, we have endeavoured to remember (<a name="ii.v-p34.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021">1 Cor. 3:21-23</a><a name="ii.v-p34.1"></A>; see also Augustin. <a name="ii.v-p34.2"></A>Ep. 28<a name="ii.v-p34.2"></A>), that all things are ours, to serve, not lord it over us, but that we axe Christ&#8217;s only, and must obey him in all things without 			 exception. He who does not draw this distinction will not have any fixed principles in religion; for those holy men were ignorant of many things, are often opposed to each other, and are sometimes at variance with themselves.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p35"></A>It is not without cause (remark our opponents) we are thus warned by Solomon, &#8220;Remove not the ancient landmarks which thy fathers have set&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p35.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#028">Prov. 22:28</a><a name="ii.v-p35.1"></A>). But the same rule applies not to the measuring of fields and the obedience of faith. The rule applicable to the latter is, &#8220;Forget also thine own people, and thy father&#8217;s house&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p35.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010">Ps. 45:10</a><a name="ii.v-p35.2"></A>). But if they are so fond of allegory, why do they not understand the apostles, rather than any other class of Fathers, to be meant 			 by those whose landmarks it is unlawful to remove? This is the interpretation of Jerome, whose words they have quoted in their canons. But as regards those to whom they apply the passage, if they wish the landmarks to be fixed, why do they, whenever it suits their purpose, so freely overleap them?</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p36"></A>Among the Fathers there were two, the one of whom said,1 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A>
 			 &#8220;Our God neither eats nor drinks, and therefore has no need of chalices and salvers;&#8221; and the other,1 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A>
 			 &#8220;Sacred rites do not require gold, and things which are not bought with gold, please not by gold.&#8221; They step beyond the boundary, therefore, when in sacred matters they are so much delighted with gold, driver, ivory, marble, gems, and silks, that unless everything is overlaid with costly show, or rather insane luxury1 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A>
 			 , they think God is not duly worshipped.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p40"></A>It was a Father who said,1 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A>
 			 &#8220;He ate flesh freely on the day on which others abstained from it, because he was a Christian.&#8221; They overleap the boundaries, therefore, when they doom to perdition every soul that, during Lent, shall have tasted flesh.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p42"></A>There were two Fathers, the one of whom said,2 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A>
 			 &#8220;A monk not labouring with his own hands is no better than a violent man and a robber;&#8221; and the other,2 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A>
 			 &#8220;Monks, however assiduous they may be in study, meditation, and prayer, must not live by others.&#8221; This boundary, too, they transgressed, when they placed lazy gormandising monks in dens and stews, to gorge themselves on other men&#8217;s substance.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p45"></A>It was a Father who said,2 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A>
 			 &#8220;It is a horrid abomination to see in Christian temples a painted image either of Christ or of any saint.&#8221; Nor was this pronounced by the voice era single individual; but an Ecclesiastical Council also decreed,2 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A>
 			 &#8220;Let nought that is worshipped be depicted on walls.&#8221;2 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A>
 			 Very far are they from keeping within these boundaries when they leave not a corner without images.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p49"></A>Another Father counselled,2 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A>
 			 &#8220;That after performing the office of humanity to the dead in their burial, we should leave them at rest.&#8221; These limits they burst through when they keep up a perpetual anxiety about the dead.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p51"></A>It is a Father who testifies,2 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A>
 			 &#8220;That the substance of bread and wine in the Eucharist does not cease but remains, just as the nature and substance of man remains united to the Godhead in the Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; This boundary they pass in pretending that, as soon as the words of our Lord are pronounced, the substance of bread and wine ceases, and is transubstantiated into body and blood.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p53"></A>They were Fathers, who, as they exhibited only one Eucharist to the whole Church,2 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A>
 			 and kept back from it the profane and flagitious; so they, in the severest terms, censured all those2 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A>
 			 who, being present, did not communicate How far have they removed these landmarks, in filling not churches only, but also private houses, with their masses, admitting all and sundry to be present, each the more willingly the more largely he pays, however wicked and impure he may be,&#8212;not inviting any one to faith in Christ and faithful communion in the sacraments, but rather vending their own work for the grace and merits of Christ!2 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A>
 		</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p57"></A>There were two Fathers, the one of whom decided that those were to be excluded altogether from partaking of Christ&#8217;s sacred supper,3 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A>
 			 who, contented with communion in one kind, abstained from the other; while the other Father strongly contends3 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A>
 			 that the blood of the Lord ought not to be denied to the Christian people, who, in confessing him, are enjoined to shed their own blood. These landmarks, also, they removed, when, by an unalterable law, they ordered the very thing which the former Father punished with excommunication, and the latter condemned for a valid reason.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p60"></A>It was a Father who pronounced it rashness,3 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A>
 			 in an obscure question, to decide in either way without clear and evident authority from Scripture. They forgot this landmark when they enacted so many constitutions, so many canons, and so many dogmatical decisions, without sanction from the word of God.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p62"></A>It was a Father who reproved Montanus, among other heresies,3 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A>
 			 for being the first who imposed laws of fasting. They have gone far beyond this landmark also in enjoining fasting under the strictest laws.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p64"></A>It was a Father who denie that the ministers of the Church should be interdicted from marrying, and pronounced married life to be a state of chastity; and there were other Fathers who assented to his decision. These boundaries they overstepped in rigidly binding their priests to celibacy.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p65"></A>It was a Father who thought3 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A>
 			 that Christ only should be listened to, from its being said, &#8220;hear him;&#8221; and that regard is due not to what others before us have said or done, but only to what Christ, the head of all, has commanded. This landmark they neither observe themselves nor allow to be observed by others, while they subject themselves and others to any master whatever, rather than Christ.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p67"></A>There is a Father who contends3 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A>
 			 that the Church ought not to prefer herself to Christ, who always judges truly, whereas ecclesiastical judges, who are but men, are generally deceived. Having burst through this barrier also, they hesitate not to suspend the whole authority of Scripture on the judgment of the Church.3 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A>
 		</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p70"></A>All the Fathers with one heart execrated, and with one mouth proteste against, contaminating the word of God with the subtleties sophists, and involving it in the brawls of dialecticians. Do they keep within these limits when the sole occupation of their lives is to entwine and entangle the simplicity of Scripture with endless disputes, and worse than sophistical jargon? So much so, that were the Fathers to rise from their graves, and listen to the brawling art which 			 bears the name of speculative theology, there is nothing they would suppose it less to be than a discussion of a religious nature.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p71"></A>But my discourse would far exceed its just limits were I to show, in detail, how petulantly those men shake off the yoke of the Fathers, while they wish to be thought their most obedient sons. Months, nay, years would fail me; and yet so deplorable and desperate is their effrontery, that they presume to chastise us for overstepping the ancient landmarks!</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p72"></A>5. Then, again, it is to no purpose they call us to the bar of custom. To make everything yield to custom would be to do the greatest injustice. Were the judgments of mankind correct, custom would be regulated by the good. But it is often far otherwise in point of fact; for, whatever the many are seen to do, forthwith obtains the force of custom. But human affairs have scarcely ever been so happily constituted as that the better course pleased the greater number. Hence 			 the private vices of the multitude have generally resulted in public error, or rather that common consent in vice which these worthy men would have to be law. Any one with eyes may perceive that it is not one flood of evils which has deluged us; that many fatal plagues have invaded the globe; that all things rush headlong; so that either the affairs of men must be altogether despaired of, or we must not only resist, but boldly attack prevailing evils. The cure is prevented by no other cause 			 than the length of time during which we have been accustomed to the disease. But be it so that public error must have a place in human society, still, in the kingdom of God, we must look and listen only to his eternal truth, against which no series of years, no custom, no conspiracy, can plead prescription. Thus Isaiah formerly taught the people of God, &#8220;Say ye not, A confederacy, to all to whom this people shall say, A confederacy;&#8221; i.e. do not unite with the people in an impious consent; 			 &#8220;neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p72.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#012">Is. 8:12</a><a name="ii.v-p72.1"></A>). Now, therefore, let them, if they will, object to us both past ages and present examples; if we sanctify the Lord of hosts, we shall not be greatly afraid. Though many ages should have consented to like ungodliness, He is strong who taketh vengeance to the third and fourth generation; or the whole world should league together in the same iniquity. He 			 taught experimentally what the end is of those who sin with the multitude, when He destroyed the whole human race with a flood, saving Noah with his little family, who, by putting his faith in Him alone, &#8220;condemned the world&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p72.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007">Heb. 11:7</a><a name="ii.v-p72.2"></A>). In short, depraved custom is just a kind of general pestilence in which men perish not the less that they fall in a crowd. It were well, moreover, to ponder the observation of Cyprian,3 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A>
 			 that those who sin in ignorance, though they cannot be entirely exculpated, seem, however, to be, in some sense, excusable; whereas those who obstinately reject the truth, when presented to them by the kindness of God, have no defence to offer.4 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A>
 		</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p75"></A>6. Their dilemma does not push us so violently as to oblige us to confess, either that the Church was a considerable time without life, or that we have now a quarrel with the Church. The Church of Christ assuredly has lived, and will live, as long as Christ shall reign at the right hand of the Father. By his hand it is sustained, by his protection defended, by his mighty power preserved in safety. For what he once undertook he will undoubtedly perform, he will be with 			 iris people always, &#8220;even to the end of the world&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p75.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020">Mt. 28:20</a><a name="ii.v-p75.1"></A>). With the Church we wage no war, since, with one consent, in common with the whole body of the faithful, we worship and adore one God, and Christ Jesus the Lord, as all the pious have always adored him. But they themselves err not a little from the truth in not recognising any church but that which they behold with the bodily eye, and in endeavouring to circumscribe it by limits, within which it cannot be confined.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p76"></A>The hinges on which the controversy turns are these: first, in their contending that the form of the Church is always visible and apparent; and, secondly, in their placing this form in the see of the Church of Rome and its hierarchy. We, on the contrary, maintain, both that the Church may exist without any apparent form, and, moreover, that the form is not ascertained by that external splendour which they foolishly admire, but by a very different mark, namely, by the 			 pure preaching of the word of God, and the due administration of the sacraments. They make an outcry whenever the Church cannot be pointed to with the finger. But how oft was it the fate of the Church among the Jews to be so defaced that no comeliness appeared? What do we suppose to have been the splendid form when Elijah complained that he was left alone? (<a name="ii.v-p76.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#014">1 Kings 19:14</a><a name="ii.v-p76.1"></A>). How long after the advent of Christ did it lie hid without form? How often since has it been so oppressed by wars, 			 seditions, and heresies, that it was nowhere seen in splendour? Had they lived at that time, would they have believed there was any Church? But Elijah learned that there remained seven thousand men who had not bowed the knee to Baal; nor ought we to doubt that Christ has always reigned on earth ever since he ascended to heaven. Had the faithful at that time required some discernible form, must they not have forthwith given way to despondency? And, indeed, Hilary accounted it a very great fault 			 in his day, that men were so possessed with a foolish admiration of Episcopal dignity as not to perceive the deadly hydra lurking under that mask. His words are (Cont. Auxentium), &#8220;One advice I give: Beware of Antichrist; for, unhappily, a love of walls has seized you; unhappily, the Church of God which you venerate exists in houses and buildings; unhappily, under these you find the name of peace. Is it doubtful that in these Antichrist will have his seat? Safer to me are mountains, and woods, 			 and lakes, and dungeons, and whirlpools; since in these prophets, dwelling or immersed, did prophesy.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p77"></A>And what is it at the present day that the world venerates in its horned bishops, unless that it imagines those who are seen presiding over celebrated cities to be holy prelates of religion? Away, then, with this absurd mode of judging!4 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A>
 			 Let us rather reverently admit, that as God alone knows who are his, so he may sometimes withdraw the external manifestation of his Church from the view of men. This, I allow, is a fearful punishment which God sends on the earth; but if the wickedness of men so deserves, why do we strive to oppose the just vengeance of God?4 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A>
 			 It was thus that God, in past ages, punished the ingratitude of men; for after they had refused to obey his truth, and had extinguished his light, he allowed them, when blinded by sense, both to be deluded by lying vanities and plunged in thick darkness, so that no face of a true Church appeared. Meanwhile, however, though his own people were dispersed and concealed amidst errors and darkness, he saved them from destruction. No wonder; for he knew how to preserve them even in the 			 confusion of Babylon and the flame of the fiery furnace.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p80"></A>But as to the wish that the form of the Church should be ascertained by some kind of vain pomp, how perilous it is I will briefly indicate, rather than explain, that I may not exceed all bounds. What they say is, that the Pontiff,4 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_40"><FONT SIZE="1">41</FONT></A>
 			 who holds the apostolic see, and the priests who are anointed and consecrated by him,4 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A>
 			 provided they have the insignia of fillets and mitres, represent the Church, and ought to be considered as in the place of the Church, and therefore cannot err. Why so? because they are pastors of the Church, and consecrated to the Lord. And were not Aaron and other prefects of Israel pastors? But Aaron and his sons, though already set apart to the priesthood, erred notwithstanding when they made the calf (<a name="ii.v-p82.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004">Exod. 32:4</a><a name="ii.v-p82.1"></A>). Why, according to this view, should not the four hundred prophets 			 who lied to Ahab represent the Church? (<a name="ii.v-p82.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#011">1 Kings 22:11</a><a name="ii.v-p82.2"></A>, &c.). The Church, however, stood on the side of Micaiah. He was alone, indeed, and despised, but from his mouth the truth proceeded. Did not the prophets also exhibit both the name and face of the Church, when, with one accord, they rose up against Jeremiah, and with menaces boasted of it as a thing impossible that the law should perish from the priest, or counsel from the wise, or the word from the prophet? (<a name="ii.v-p82.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018">Jer. 18:18</a><a name="ii.v-p82.3"></A>). In opposition 			 to the whole body of the prophets, Jeremiah is sent alone to declare from the Lord (<a name="ii.v-p82.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#009">Jer. 4:9</a><a name="ii.v-p82.4"></A>), that a time would come when the law would perish from the priest, counsel from the wise, and the word from the prophet. Was not like splendour displayed in that council when the chief priests, scribes, and Pharisees assembled to consult how they might put Jesus to death? Let them go, then, and cling to the external mask, while they make Christ and all the prophets of God schismatics, and, on the other 			 hand, make Satan&#8217;s ministers the organs of the Holy Spirit!</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p83"></A>But if they are sincere, let them answer me in good faith,&#8212;in what place, and among whom, do they think the Church resided, after the Council of Basle degraded and deposed Eugenius from the popedom, and substituted Amadeus in his place? Do their utmost, they cannot deny that that Council was legitimate as far as regards external forms, and was summoned not only by one Pontiff, but by two. Eugenius, with the whole herd of cardinals and bishops who had joined him in 			 plotting the dissolution of the Council, was there condemned of contumacy, rebellion, and schism. Afterwards, however, aided by the favour of princes, he got back his popedom safe. The election of Amadeus, duly made by the authority of a general holy synod, went to smoke; only he himself was appeased with a cardinal&#8217;s cap, like a piece of offal thrown to a barking dog. Out of the lap of these rebellious and contumacious schismatics proceeded all future popes, cardinals, bishops, abbots, and 			 presbyters. Here they are caught, and cannot escape. For, on which party will they bestow the name of Church? Will they deny it to have been a general Council, though it lacked nothing as regards external majesty, having been solemnly called by two bulls, consecrated by the legate of the Roman See as its president, constituted regularly in all respects, and continuing in possession of all its honours to the last? Will they admit that Eugenius, and his whole train, through whom they have all 			 been consecrated, were schismatical? Let them, then, either define the form of the Church differently, or, however numerous they are, we will hold them all to be schismatics in having knowingly and willingly received ordination from heretics. But had it never been discovered before that the Church is not tied to external pomp, we are furnished with a lengthened proof in their own conduct, in proudly vending themselves to the world under the specious title of Church, notwithstanding that they 			 are the deadly pests of the Church. I speak not of their manners and of those tragical atrocities with which their whole life teems, since it is said that they are Pharisees who should be heard, not imitated. By devoting some portion of your leisure to our writings, you will see, not obscurely, that their doctrine&#8212;the very doctrine to which they say it is owing that they are the Church&#8212;is a deadly murderer of souls, the firebrand, ruin, and destruction of the Church.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p84"></A>7. Lastly, they are far from candid when they invidiously number up the disturbances, tumults, and disputes, which the preaching of our doctrine has brought in its train, and the fruits which, in many instances, it now produces; for the doctrine itself is undeservedly charged with evils which ought to be ascribed to the malice of Satan. It is one of the characteristics of the divine word, that whenever it appears, Satan ceases to slumber and sleep. This is the surest and 			 most unerring test for distinguishing it from false doctrines which readily betray themselves, while they are received by all with willing ears, and welcomed by an applauding world. Accordingly, for several ages, during which all things were immersed in profound darkness, almost all mankin were mere jest and sport to the god of this world, who, like any Sardanapalus, idled and luxuriated undisturbed. For what else could he do but laugh and sport while in tranquil and undisputed possession of 			 his kingdom? But when light beaming from above somewhat dissipated the darkness&#8212;when the strong man arose and aimed a blow at his kingdom&#8212;then, indeed, he began to shake off his wonted torpor, and rush to arms. And first he stirred up the hands of men, that by them he might violently suppress the dawning truth; but when this availed him not, he turned to snares, exciting dissensions and disputes about doctrine by means of his Catabaptists, and other portentous miscreants, that he might thus 			 obscure, and, at length, extinguish the truth. And now be persists in assailing it with both engines, endeavouring to pluck up the true seed by the violent hand of man, and striving, as much as in him lies, to choke it with his tares, that it may not grow and bear knit. But it will be in vain, if we listen to the admonition of the Lord, who long ago disclosed his wiles, that we might not be taken unawares, and armed us with full protection against all his machinations. But how malignant to 			 throw upon the word of God itself the blame either of the seditions which wicked men and rebels, or of the sects which impostors stir up against it! The example, however, is not new. Elijah was interrogated whether it were not he that troubled Israel. Christ was seditious, according to the Jews; and the apostles were charged with the crime of popular commotion. What else do those who, in the present day, impute to us all the disturbances, tumults, and contentions which break out against us? 			 Elijah, however, has taught us our answer (<a name="ii.v-p84.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#017">1 Kings 18:17</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#018">18</a><a name="ii.v-p84.1"></A>). It is not we who disseminate errors or stir up tumults, but they who resist the mighty power of God.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p85"></A>But while this single answer is sufficient to rebut the rash charges of these men, it is necessary, on the other hand, to consult for the weakness of those who take the alarm at such scandals, and not unfrequently waver in perplexity. But that they may not fall away in this perplexity, and forfeit their good degree, let them know that the apostles in their day experienced the very things which now befall us. There were then unlearned and unstable men who, as Peter tells 			 us (<a name="ii.v-p85.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#016">2 Pet. 3:16</a><a name="ii.v-p85.1"></A>), wrested the inspired writings of Paul to their own destruction. There were despisers of God, who, when they heard that sin abounded in order that grace might more abound, immediately inferred, &#8220;We will continue in sin that grace may abound&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p85.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001">Rom. 6:1</a><a name="ii.v-p85.2"></A>); when they heard that believers were not under the law, but under grace, forthwith sung out, &#8220;We will sin because we are not under the law, but under grace&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p85.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#015">Rom. 6:15</a><a name="ii.v-p85.3"></A>). There were some who charged the apostle with being the 			 minister of sin. Many false prophets entered in privily to pull down the churches which he had reared. Some preached the gospel through envy and strife, not sincerely (<a name="ii.v-p85.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#015">Phil. 1:15</a><a name="ii.v-p85.4"></A>)&#8212;maliciously even&#8212;thinking to add affliction to his bonds. Elsewhere the gospel made little progress. All sought their own, not the things which were Jesus Christ&#8217;s. Others went back like the dog to his vomit, or the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire. Great numbers perverted their spiritual freedom to 			 carnal licentiousness. False brethren crept in to the imminent danger of the faithful. Among the brethren themselves various quarrels arose. What, then, were the apostles to do? Were they either to dissemble for the time, or rather lay aside and abandon that gospel which they saw to be the seed&#8212;bed of so many strifes, the source of so many perils, the occasion of so many scandals? In straits of this kind, they remembered that &#8220;Christ was a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence,&#8221; &#8220;set up for 			 the fall and rising again of many,&#8221; and &#8220;for a sign to be spoken against&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p85.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034">Luke 2:34</a><a name="ii.v-p85.5"></A>); and, armed with this assurance, they proceeded boldly through all perils from tumults and scandals. It becomes us to be supported by the same consideration, since Paul declares that it is a neverfailing characteristic of the gospel to be a &#8220;savour of death unto death in them that perish&#8221; (<a name="ii.v-p85.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016">2 Cor. 2:16</a><a name="ii.v-p85.6"></A>), although rather destined to us for the purpose of being a savour of life unto life, and the power of God for 			 the salvation of believers. This we should certainly experience it to be, did we not by our ingratitude corrupt this unspeakable gift of God, and turn to our destruction what ought to be our only saving defence.4 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">43</FONT></A>
 		</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="ii.v-p87"></A>But to return, Sire.4 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">44</FONT></A>
 			 Be not moved by the absurd insinuations with which our adversaries are striving to frighten you into the belief that nothing else is wished and aimed at by this new gospel (for so they term it), than opportunity for sedition and impunity for all kinds of vice. Our Go is not the author of division, but of peace; and the Son of God, who came to destroy the works of the devil, is not the minister of sin. We, too, are undeservedly charged with desires of a kind for which we have never 			 given even the smallest suspicion. We, forsooth, meditate the subversion of kingdoms; we, whose voice was never heard in faction, and whose life, while passed under you, is known to have been always quiet and simple; even now, when exiled from our home, we nevertheless cease not to pray for all prosperity to your person and your kingdom. We, forsooth, are aiming after an unchecked indulgence in vice, in whose manners, though there is much to be blamed, there is nothing which deserves such an 			 imputation; nor (thank God) have we profited so little in the gospel that our life may not be to these slanderers an example of chastity, kindness, pity, temperance, patience, moderation, or any other virtue. It is plain, indeed, that we fear God sincerely, and worship him in truth, since, whether by life or by death, we desire his name to be hallowed; and hatred herself has been forced to bear testimony to the innocence and civil integrity of some of our people on whom death was inflicted for 			 the very thing which deserved the highest praise. But if any, under pretext of the gospel, excite tumults (none such have as yet been detected in your realm), if any use the liberty of the grace of God as a cloak for licentiousness (I know of numbers who do), there are laws and legal punishments by which they may be punished up to the measure of their deserts&#8212;only, in the mean time, let not the gospel of God be evil spoken of because of the iniquities of evil men.</p>

 			 That you may not lend too credulous an ear to the accusations of our enemies, their virulent injustice has been set before you at sufficient length; I fear even more than sufficient, since this preface has grown almost to the bulk of a full apology. My object, however, was not to frame a defence, but only with a view to the hearing of our cause, to mollify your mind, now indeed turned away and estranged from us&#8212;I add, even inflamed against us&#8212;but whose good will, we are confident, we 			 should regain, would you but once, with calmness and composure, read this our Confession, which we desire your Majesty to accept instead of a defence. But if the whispers of the malevolent so possess your ear, that the accused are to have no opportunity of pleading their cause; if those vindictive furies, with your connivance, are always to rage with bonds, scourgings, tortures, maimings, and burnings, we, indeed, like sheep doomed to slaughter, shall be reduced to every extremity; yet so that, 			 in our patience, we will possess our souls, and wait for the strong hand of the Lord, which, doubtless, will appear in its own time, and show itself armed, both to rescue the poor from affliction, and also take vengeance on the despisers, who are now exulting so securely.5 			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A>
