<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p1"></A>43. We receive Christ the Redeemer by the power of the Holy Spirit, who unites us to Christ; and, therefore, he is called the Spirit of sanctification and adoption, the earnest and seal of our salvation, water, oil, a fountain, fire, the hand of God.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p2"></A>44. Faith is the hand of the soul, which receives, through the same efficacy of the Holy Spirit, Christ offered to us in the Gospel.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p3"></A>45. The general office of faith is, to assent to the truth of God, whenever, whatever, and in what manner soever he speaks; but its peculiar office is, to behold the will of God in Christ, his mercy, the promises of grace, for the full conviction of which the Holy Spirit enlightens our minds and strengthens our hearts.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p4"></A>46. Faith, therefore, is a steady and certain knowledge of the divine kindness towards us, which is founded on a gracious promise through Christ, and is revealed to our minds and sealed on our hearts by the Holy Spirit.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p5"></A>47. The effects of faith are four: 1. Repentance; 2. A Christian life; 3. Justification; 4. Prayer.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p6"></A>48. True repentance consists of two parts: 1. Mortification, which proceeds from the acknowledgment of sin, and a real perception of the divine displeasure; 2. Quickening, the fruits of which are&#8212;piety towards God, charity towards our neighbour, the hope of eternal life, holiness of life. With this true repentance is contrasted false repentance, the parts of which are, Contrition, Confession, and Satisfaction. The two former may be referred to true repentance, provided 			 that there be contrition of heart on account of the acknowledgment of sin, and that it be not separated from the hope of forgiveness through Christ; and provided that the confession be either <i>private</i> to God alone, or made to the pastors of the Church willingly and for the purpose of consolation, not for the enumeration of offences, and for introducing a torture of the conscience; or <i>public</i>, which is made to the whole Church, or to one or many persons in presence of the whole 			 Church. What was formerly called Ecclesiastical Satisfaction, that is, what was made for the edification of the Church on account of repentance and public confession of sins, was introduced as due to God by the Sophists; whence sprung the supplements of Indulgences in this world, and the fire of Purgatory after death. But that Contrition of the Sophists, and auricular Confession (as they call it), and the Satisfaction of actual performance, are opposed to the free forgiveness of sins.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p7"></A>49. The two parts of a Christian life are laid down: 1. The love of righteousness; that we may be holy, because God is holy, and because we are united to him, and are reckoned among his people; 2. That a rule may be prescribed to us, which does not permit us to wander in the course of righteousness, and that we may be conformed to Christ. A model of this is laid down to us, which we ought to copy in our whole life. Next are mentioned the blessings of God, which it will 			 argue extreme ingratitude if we do not requite.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p8"></A>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p9"></A>50. The sum of the Christian life is denial of ourselves.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p10"></A>51. The ends of this self-denial are four. 1. That we may devote ourselves to God as a living sacrifice. 2. That we may not seek our own things, but those which belong to God and to our neighbour. 3. That we may patiently bear the cross, the fruits of which are&#8212;acknowledgment of our weakness, the trial of our patience, correction of faults, more earnest prayer, more cheerful meditation on eternal life. 4. That we may know in what manner we ought to use the present life 			 and its aids, for necessity and delight. Necessity demands that we possess all things as though we possessed them not; that we bear poverty with mildness, and abundance with moderation; that we know how to endure patiently fulness, and hunger, and want; that we pay regard to our neighbour, because we must give account of our stewardship; and that all things correspond to our calling. The delight of praising the kindness of God ought to be with us a stronger argument.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p11"></A>52. In considering Justification, which is the third effect of faith, the first thing that occurs is an explanation of the word. He is said to be justified who, in the judgment of God, is deemed righteous. He is justified by works, whose life is pure and blameless before God; and no such person ever existed except Christ. They are justified by faith who, shut out from the righteousness of works, receive the righteousness of Christ. Such are the elect of God.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p12"></A>53. Hence follows the strongest consolation; for instead of a severe Judge, we have a most merciful Father. Justified in Christ, and having peace, trusting to his power, we aim at holiness.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p13"></A>54. Next follows Christian liberty, consisting of three parts. 1. That the consciences of believers may rise above the Law, and may forget the whole righteousness of the Law. 2. That the conscience, free from the yoke of the Law, may cheerfully obey the will of God. 3. That they may not be bound by any religious scruples before God about things indifferent. But here we must avoid two precipices. 1. That we do not abuse the gifts of God. 2. That we avoid giving and taking 			 offence.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p14"></A>55. The fourth effect of faith is Prayer; in which are considered its fruits, laws, faults, and petitions.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p15"></A>56. The fruit of prayer is fivefold. 1. When we are accustomed to flee to God, our heart is inflamed with a stronger desire to seek, love, and adore him. 2. Our heart is not a prey to any wicked desire, of which we would be ashamed to make God our witness. 3. We receive his benefits with thanksgiving. 4. Having obtained a gift, we more earnestly meditate on the goodness of God. 5. Experience confirms to us the Goodness, Providence, and Truth of God.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p16"></A>57. The laws are Four. 1. That we should have our heart framed as becomes those who enter into converse with God; and therefore the lifting up of the hands, the raising of the heart, and perseverance, are recommended. 2. That we should feel our wants. 3. That we should divest ourselves of every thought of our own glory, giving the whole glory to God. 4. That while we are prostrated amidst overwhelming evils, we should be animated by the sure hope of succeeding, since we 			 rely on the command and promise of God.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p17"></A>58. They err who call on the Saints that are placed beyond this life. 1. Because Scripture teaches that prayer ought to be offered to God alone, who alone knows what is necessary for us. He chooses to be present, because he has promised. He can do so, for he is Almighty. 2. Because he requires that he be addressed in faith, which rests on his word and promise. 3. Because faith is corrupted as soon as it departs from this rule. But in calling on the saints there is no 			 word, no promise; and therefore there is no faith; nor can the saints themselves either hear or assist.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p18"></A>59. The summary of prayer, which has been delivered to us by Christ the Lord, is contained in a Preface and two Tables.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p19"></A>60. In the Preface, the Goodness of God is conspicuous, for he is called <i>our Father</i>. It follows that we are his children, and that to seek supplies from any other quarter would be to charge God either with poverty or with cruelty; that sins ought not to hinder us from humbly imploring mercy; and that a feeling of brotherly love ought to exist amongst us. The power of God is likewise conspicuous in this Preface, for he is <i>in Heaven</i>. Hence we infer that God 			 is present everywhere, and that when we seek him, we ought to rise above perceptions of the body and the soul; that he is far beyond all risk of change or corruption; that he holds the whole universe in his grasp, and governs it by his power.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p20"></A>61. The First Table is entirely devoted to the glory of God, and contains Three petitions. 1. That the <i>name</i> of God, that is, his power, goodness, wisdom, justice, and truth, <i>may be hallowed</i>; that is, that men may neither speak nor think of God but with the deepest veneration. 2. That God may correct, by the agency of his Spirit, all the depraved lusts of the flesh; may bring all our thoughts into obedience to his authority; may protect his children; and may 			 defeat the attempts of the wicked. The use of this petition is threefold. (1). It withdraws us from the corruptions of the world. (2). It inflames us with the desire of mortifying the flesh. (3). It animates us to endure the cross. 3. The Third petition relates not to the secret will of God, but to that which is made known by the Scriptures, and to which voluntary obedience is the counterpart.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p21"></A>62. The Second Table contains the Three remaining petitions, which relate to ourselves and our neighbours. 1. It asks everything which the body needs in this sublunary state; for we commit ourselves to the care and providence of God, that he may feed, foster, and preserve us. 2. We ask those things which contribute to the spiritual life, namely, the <i>forgiveness of sins</i>, which implies satisfaction, and to which is added a condition, that when we have been offended 			 by deed or by word, we nevertheless forgive them their offences against us. 3. We ask <i>deliverance from temptations</i>, or, that we may be furnished with armour and defended by the Divine protection, that we may be able to obtain the victory. <i>Temptations</i> differ in their <i>cause</i>, for God, Satan, the world, and the flesh <i>tempt</i>; in their <i>matter</i>, for we are tempted, on the right hand, in respect of riches, honours, beauty, &c., and on the left hand, in respect of 			 poverty, contempt, and afflictions: and in their <i>end</i>, for God tempts the godly for good, but Satan, the flesh, and the world, tempt them for evil.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p22"></A>63. Those Four effects of faith bring us to the certainty of election, and of the final resurrection.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p23"></A>64. The causes of election are these. The <i>efficient</i> cause is&#8212;the free mercy of God, which we ought to acknowledge with humility and thanksgiving. The <i>material</i> cause is&#8212;Christ, the well-beloved Son. The <i>final</i> cause is&#8212;that, being assured of our salvation, because we are God&#8217;s people, we may glorify him both in this life and in the life which is to come, to all eternity. The effects are, in respect either of many persons, or of a single individual; and 			 that by electing some, and justly reprobating others. The elect are called by the preaching of the word and the illumination of the Holy Spirit, are justified, and sanctified, that they may at length be glorified.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iii-p24"></A>65. The final resurrection will take place. 1. Because on any other supposition we cannot be perfectly glorified. 2. Because Christ rose in our flesh. 3. Because God is Almighty.</p>
