<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p2"></A>The three divisions of this chapter are,&#8212;I. The article of the Creed concerning the Holy Catholic Church and the Communion of Saints briefly expounded. The grounds on which the Church claims our reverence, sec. 1-6. II. Of the marks of the Church, sec. 7-9. III. The necessity of cleaving to the Holy Catholic Church and the Communion of Saints. Refutation of the errors of the Novatians, Anabaptists, and other schismatics, in regard to this matter, sec. 10-29.</p>  			 
<p class="introHead"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p3"></A><i>Sections</i>.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p4"></A>1. The church now to be considered. With her God has deposited whatever is necessary to faith and good order. A summary of what is contained in this Book. Why it begins with the Church.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p5"></A>2. In what sense the article of the Creed concerning the Church is to be understood. Why we should say, &#8220;I believe the Church,&#8221; not &#8220;I believe in the Church.&#8221; The purport of this article. Why the Church is called Catholic or Universal.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p6"></A>3. What meant by the Communion of Saints. Whether it is inconsistent with various gifts in the saints, or with civil order. Uses of this article concerning the Church and the Communion of Saints. Must the Church be visible in order to our maintaining unity with her?</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p7"></A>4. The name of Mother given to the Church shows how necessary it is to know her. No salvation out of the Church.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p8"></A>5. The Church is our mother, inasmuch as God has committed to her the kind office of bringing us up in the faith until we attain full age. This method of education not to be despised. Useful to us in two ways. This utility destroyed by those who despise the pastors and teachers of the Church. The petulance of such despisers repressed by reason and Scripture. For this education of the Church her children enjoined to meet in the sanctuary. The abuse of churches both 				before and since the advent of Christ. Their proper use.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p9"></A>6. Her ministry effectual, but not without the Spirit of God. Passages in proof of this.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p10"></A>7. Second part of the Chapter. Concerning the marks of the Church. In what respect the Church is invisible. In what respect she is visible.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p11"></A>8. God alone knoweth them that are his. Still he has given marks to discern his children.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p12"></A>9. These marks are the ministry of the word, and administration of the sacraments instituted by Christ. The same rule not to be followed in judging of individuals and of churches.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p13"></A>10. We must on no account forsake the Church distinguished by such marks. Those who act otherwise are apostates, deserters of the truth and of the household of God, deniers of God and Christ, violators of the mystical marriage.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p14"></A>11. These marks to be the more carefully observed, because Satan strives to efface them, or to make us revolt from the Church. The twofold error of despising the true, and submitting to a false Church.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p15"></A>12. Though the common profession should contain some corruption, this is not a sufficient reason for forsaking the visible Church. Some of these corruptions specified. Caution necessary. The duty of the members.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p16"></A>13. The immoral lives of certain professors no ground for abandoning the Church. Error on this head of the ancient and modern Cathari. Their first objection. Answer to it from three of our Saviour&#8217;s parables.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p17"></A>14. Second objection. Answer from a consideration of the state of the Corinthian Church, and the Churches of Galatia.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p18"></A>15. Third objection and answer.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p19"></A>16. The origin of these objections. A description of Schismatics. Their portraiture by Augustine. A pious counsel respecting these scandals, and a safe remedy against them.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p20"></A>17. Fourth objection and answer. Answer confirmed by the divine promises.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p21"></A>18. Another confirmation from the example of Christ and of the faithful servants of God. The appearance of the Church in the days of the prophets.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p22"></A>19. Appearance of the Church in the days of Christ and the apostles, and their immediate followers.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p23"></A>20. Fifth objection. Answer to the ancient and modern Cathari, and to the Novatians, concerning the forgiveness of sins</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p24"></A>21. Answer to the fifth objection continued. By the forgiveness of sins believers are enabled to remain perpetually in the Church.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p25"></A>22. The keys of the Church given for the express purpose of securing this benefit. A summary of the answer to the fifth objection.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p26"></A>23. Sixth objection, formerly advanced by the Novatians, and renewed by the Anabaptists. This error confuted by the Lord&#8217;s Prayer.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p27"></A>24. A second answer, founded on some examples under the Old Testament.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p28"></A>25. A third answer, confirmed by passages from Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Solomon. A fourth answer, derived from sacrifices.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p29"></A>26. A fifth answer, from the New Testament. Some special examples.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p30"></A>27. General examples. A celebrated passage. The arrangement of the Creed.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p31"></A>28 Objection, that voluntary transgression excludes from the Church.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p32"></A>29. Last objection of the Novatians, founded on the solemn renewal of repentance required by the Church for more heinous offences. Answer.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p33"></A>1. In the last Book, it has been shown, that by the faith of the gospel Christ becomes ours, and we are made partakers of the salvation and eternal blessedness procured by him. But as our ignorance and sloth (I may add, the vanity of our mind) stand in need of external helps, by which faith may be begotten in us, and may increase and make progress until its consummation, God, in accommodation to our infirmity, has added such helps, and secured the effectual preaching 				of the gospel, by depositing this treasure with the Church. He has appointed pastors and teachers, by whose lips he might edify his people (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p33.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011">Eph. 4:11</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p33.1"></A>); he has invested them with authority, and, in short, omitted nothing that might conduce to holy consent in the faith, and to right order. In particular, he has instituted sacraments, which we feel by experience to be most useful helps in fostering and confirming our faith. For seeing we are shut up in the prison of the body, and have not yet 				attained to the rank of angels, God, in accommodation to our capacity, has in his admirable providence provided a method by which, though widely separated, we might still draw near to him. Wherefore, due order requires that we first treat of the Church, of its Government, Orders, and Power; next, of the Sacraments; and, lastly, of Civil Government;&#8212;at the same time guarding pious readers against the corruptions of the Papacy, by which Satan has adulterated all that God had appointed for our 				salvation. I will begin with the Church, into whose bosom God is pleased to collect his children, not only that by her aid and ministry they may be nourished so long as they are babes and children, but may also be guided by her maternal care until they grow up to manhood, and, finally, attain to the perfection of faith. What God has thus joined, let not man put asunder (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p33.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#009">Mark 10:9</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p33.2"></A>): to those to whom he is a Father, the Church must also be a mother. This was true not merely under the Law, but 				even now after the advent of Christ; since Paul declares that we are the children of a new, even a heavenly Jerusalem (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p33.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026">Gal. 4:26</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p33.3"></A>).</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p34"></A>2. When in the Creed we profess to believe the Church, reference is made not only to the visible Church of which we are now treating, but also to all the elect of God, including in the number even those who have departed this life. And, accordingly, the word used is &#8220;believe,&#8221; because oftentimes no difference can be observed between the children of God and the profane, between his proper flock and the untamed herd. The particle <i>in</i> is often interpolated, but 				without any probable ground. I confess, indeed, that it is the more usual form, and is not unsupported by antiquity, since the Nicene Creed, as quoted in Ecclesiastical History, adds the preposition. At the same time, we may perceive from early writers, that the expression received without controversy in ancient times was to believe &#8220;the Church,&#8221; and not &#8220;in the Church.&#8221; This is not only the expression used by Augustine, and that ancient writer, whoever he may have been, whose treatise, <i>De 				Symboli Expositione</i>, is extant under the name of Cyprian, but they distinctly remark that the addition of the preposition would make the expression improper, and they give good grounds for so thinking. We declare that we believe in God, both because our mind reclines upon him as true, and our confidence is fully satisfied in him. This cannot be said of the Church, just as it cannot be said of the forgiveness of sins, or the resurrection of the body. Wherefore, although I am unwilling to 				dispute about words, yet I would rather keep to the proper form, as better fitted to express the thing that is meant, than affect terms by which the meaning is causelessly obscured. The object of the expression is to teach us, that though the devil leaves no stone unturned in order to destroy the grace of Christ, and the enemies of God rush with insane violence in the same direction, it cannot be extinguished,&#8212;the blood of Christ cannot be rendered barren, and prevented from producing fruit. 				Hence, regard must be had both to the secret election and to the internal calling of God, because he alone &#8220;knoweth them that are his&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p34.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019">2 Tim. 2:19</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p34.1"></A>); and as Paul expresses it, holds them as it were enclosed under his seal, although, at the same time, they wear his insignia, and are thus distinguished from the reprobate. But as they are a small and despised number, concealed in an immense crowd, like a few grains of wheat buried among a heap of chaff, to God alone must be left the knowledge of 				his Church, of which his secret election forms the foundation. 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_512"></A><A HREF="#fn_512"><FONT SIZE="1">513</FONT></A>
 				Nor is it enough to embrace the number of the elect in thought and intention merely. By the unity of the Church we must understand a unity into which we feel persuaded that we are truly ingrafted. For unless we are united with all the other members under Christ our head, no hope of the future inheritance awaits us. Hence the Church is called Catholic or Universal (August. <a name="iv.iv.ii-p35.1"></A>Ep. 48<a name="iv.iv.ii-p35.1"></A>), for two or three cannot be invented without dividing Christ; and this is impossible. All the elect of 				God are so joined together in Christ, that as they depend on one head, so they are as it were compacted into one body, being knit together like its different members; made truly one by living together under the same Spirit of God in one faith, hope, and charity, called not only to the same inheritance of eternal life, but to participation in one God and Christ. For although the sad devastation which everywhere meets our view may proclaim that no Church remains, let us know that the death of 				Christ produces fruit, and that God wondrously preserves his Church, while placing it as it were in concealment. Thus it was said to Elijah, &#8220;Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p35.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#018">1 Kings 19:18</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p35.2"></A>).</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p36"></A>3. Moreover, this article of the Creed relates in some measure to the external Church, that every one of us must maintain brotherly concord with all the children of God, give due authority to the Church, and, in short, conduct ourselves as sheep of the flock. And hence the additional expression, the &#8220;communion of saints;&#8221; for this clause, though usually omitted by ancient writers, must not be overlooked, as it admirably expresses the quality of the Church; just as if 				it had been said, that saints are united in the fellowship of Christ on this condition, that all the blessings which God bestows upon them are mutually communicated to each other. This, however, is not incompatible with a diversity of graces, for we know that the gifts of the Spirit are variously distributed; nor is it incompatible with civil order, by which each is permitted privately to possess his own means, it being necessary for the preservation of peace among men that distinct rights of 				property should exist among them. Still a community is asserted, such as Luke describes when he says, &#8220;The multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p36.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032">Acts 4:32</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p36.1"></A>); and Paul, when he reminds the Ephesians, &#8220;There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p36.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004">Eph. 4:4</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p36.2"></A>). For if they are truly persuaded that God is the common Father of them all, and Christ their common head, they cannot but be united together in brotherly love, and mutually 				impart their blessings to each other. Then it is of the highest importance for us to know what benefit thence redounds to us. For when we believe the Church, it is in order that we may be firmly persuaded that we are its members. In this way our salvation rests on a foundation so firm and sure, that though the whole fabric of the world were to give way, it could not be destroyed. First, it stands with the election of God, and cannot change or fail, any more than his eternal providence. Next, it 				is in a manner united with the stability of Christ, who will no more allow his faithful followers to be dissevered from him, than he would allow his own members to be torn to pieces. We may add, that so long as we continue in the bosom of the Church, we are sure that the truth will remain with us. Lastly, we feel that we have an interest in such promises as these, &#8220;In Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p36.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032">Joel 2:32</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p36.3"></A>; <a name="iv.iv.ii-p36.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#017">Obad. 17</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p36.4"></A>); &#8220;God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved&#8221; 				(<a name="iv.iv.ii-p36.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#005">Ps. 46:5</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p36.5"></A>). So available is communion with the Church to keep us in the fellowship of God. In the very term communion there is great consolation; because, while we are assured that everything which God bestows on his members belongs to us, all the blessings conferred upon them confirm our hope. But in order to embrace the unity of the Church in this manner, it is not necessary, as I have observed, to see it with our eyes, or feel it with our hands. Nay, rather from its being placed in faith, we 				are reminded that our thoughts are to dwell upon it, as much when it escapes our perception as when it openly appears. Nor is our faith the worse for apprehending what is unknown, since we are not enjoined here to distinguish between the elect and the reprobate (this belongs not to us, but to God only), but to feel firmly assured in our minds, that all those who, by the mercy of God the Father, through the efficacy of the Holy Spirit, have become partakers with Christ, are set apart as the 				proper and peculiar possession of God, and that as we are of the number, we are also partakers of this great grace.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p37"></A>4. But as it is now our purpose to discourse of the visible Church, 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_513"></A><A HREF="#fn_513"><FONT SIZE="1">514</FONT></A>
 				let us learn, from her single title of Mother, how useful, nay, how necessary the knowledge of her is, since there is no other means of entering into life unless she conceive us in the womb and give us birth, unless she nourish us at her breasts, and, in short, keep us under her charge and government, until, divested of mortal flesh, we become like the angels (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p38.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#030">Mt. 22:30</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p38.1"></A>). For our weakness does not permit us to leave the school until we have spent our whole lives as scholars. 				Moreover, beyond the pale of the Church no forgiveness of sins, no salvation, can be hoped for, as Isaiah and Joel testify (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p38.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#032">Isa. 37:32</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p38.2"></A>; <a name="iv.iv.ii-p38.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032">Joel 2:32</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p38.3"></A>). To their testimony Ezekiel subscribes, when he declares, &#8220;They shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p38.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#009">Ezek. 3:9</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p38.4"></A>); as, on the other hand, those who turn to the cultivation of true piety are said to inscribe their names among the citizens of Jerusalem. For which reason it is 				said in the psalm, &#8220;Remember me, O Lord, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation; that I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p38.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#004">Ps. 106:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#005">5</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p38.5"></A>). By these words the paternal favour of God and the special evidence of spiritual life are confined to his peculiar people, and hence the abandonment of the Church is always fatal.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p39"></A>5. But let us proceed to a full exposition of this view. Paul says that our Saviour &#8220;ascended far above all heavens, that he might fill all things. And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the 				measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p39.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010">Eph. 4:10-13</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p39.1"></A>). We see that God, who might perfect his people in a moment, chooses not to bring them to manhood in any other way than by the education of the Church. We see the mode of doing it expressed; the preaching of celestial doctrine is committed to pastors. We see that all without exception are brought into the same order, that they may with meek and docile spirit allow themselves to be governed by teachers appointed for this purpose. 				Isaiah had long before given this as the characteristic of the kingdom of Christ, &#8220;My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed&#8217;s seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p39.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021">Isa. 59:21</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p39.2"></A>). Hence it follows, that all who reject the spiritual food of the soul divinely offered to them by the hands of the Church, deserve to perish of hunger and famine. God 				inspires us with faith, but it is by the instrumentality of his gospel, as Paul reminds us, &#8220;Faith cometh by hearing&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p39.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017">Rom. 10:17</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p39.3"></A>). God reserves to himself the power of maintaining it, but it is by the preaching of the gospel, as Paul also declares, that he brings it forth and unfolds it. With this view, it pleased him in ancient times that sacred meetings should be held in the sanctuary, that consent in faith might be nourished by doctrine proceeding from the lips of the priest. Those 				magnificent titles, as when the temple is called God&#8217;s rest, his sanctuary, his habitation, and when he is said to dwell between the cherubims (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p39.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#013">Ps. 32:13</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#014">14</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p39.4"></A>; 80:1), are used for no other purpose than to procure respect, love, reverence, and dignity to the ministry of heavenly doctrine, to which otherwise the appearance of an insignificant human being might be in no slight degree derogatory. Therefore, to teach us that the treasure offered to us in earthen vessels is of inestimable value (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p39.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007">2 Cor. 4:7</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p39.5"></A>), God himself appears and, as the author of this ordinance, requires his presence to be recognised in his own institution. Accordingly, after forbidding his people to give heed to familiar spirits, wizards, and other superstitions (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p39.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#030">Lev. 19:30</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031">31</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p39.6"></A>), he adds, that he will give what ought to be sufficient for all&#8212;namely, that he will never leave them without prophets. For, as he did not commit his ancient people to angels, but raised up teachers on the earth to perform a truly angelical 				office, so he is pleased to instruct us in the present day by human means. But as anciently he did not confine himself to the law merely, but added priests as interpreters, from whose lips the people might inquire after his true meaning, so in the present day he would not only have us to be attentive to reading, but has appointed masters to give us their assistance. In this there is a twofold advantage. For, on the one hand, he by an admirable test proves our obedience when we listen to his 				ministers just as we would to himself; while, on the other hand, he consults our weakness in being pleased to address us after the manner of men by means of interpreters, that he may thus allure us to himself, instead of driving us away by his thunder. How well this familiar mode of teaching is suited to us all the godly are aware, from the dread with which the divine majesty justly inspires them.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p40"></A>Those who think that the authority of the doctrine is impaired by the insignificance of the men who are called to teach, betray their ingratitude; for among the many noble endowments with which God has adorned the human race, one of the most remarkable is, that he deigns to consecrate the mouths and tongues of men to his service, making his own voice to be heard in them. Wherefore, let us not on our part decline obediently to embrace the doctrine of salvation, 				delivered by his command and mouth; because, although the power of God is not confined to external means, he has, however, confined us to his ordinary method of teaching, which method, when fanatics refuse to observe, they entangle themselves in many fatal snares. Pride, or fastidiousness, or emulation, induces many to persuade themselves that they can profit sufficiently by reading and meditating in private, and thus to despise public meetings, and deem preaching superfluous. But since as much 				as in them lies they loose or burst the sacred bond of unity, none of them escapes the just punishment of this impious divorce, but become fascinated with pestiferous errors, and the foulest delusions. Wherefore, in order that the pure simplicity of the faith may flourish among us, let us not decline to use this exercise of piety, which God by his institution of it has shown to be necessary, and which he so highly recommends. None, even among the most petulant of men, would venture to say, that 				we are to shut our ears against God, but in all ages prophets and pious teachers have had a difficult contest to maintain with the ungodly, whose perverseness cannot submit to the yoke of being taught by the lips and ministry of men. This is just the same as if they were to destroy the impress of God as exhibited to us in doctrine. For no other reason were believers anciently enjoined to seek the face of God in the sanctuary (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p40.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#004">Ps. 105:4</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p40.1"></A>) (an injunction so often repeated in the Law), than because 				the doctrine of the Law, and the exhortations of the prophets, were to them a living image of God. Thus Paul declares, that in his preaching the glory of God shone in the face of Jesus Christ (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p40.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006">2 Cor. 4:6</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p40.2"></A>). The more detestable are the apostates who delight in producing schisms in churches, just as if they wished to drive the sheep from the fold, and throw them into the jaws of wolves. Let us hold, agreeably to the passage we quoted from Paul, that the Church can only be edified by external 				preaching, and that there is no other bond by which the saints can be kept together than by uniting with one consent to observe the order which God has appointed in his Church for learning and making progress. For this end, especially, as I have observed, believers were anciently enjoined under the Law to flock together to the sanctuary; for when Moses speaks of the habitation of God, he at the same time calls it the place of the name of God, the place where he will record his name (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p40.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024">Exod. 20:24</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p40.3"></A>); thus plainly teaching that no use could be made of it without the doctrine of godliness. And there can be no doubt that, for the same reason, David complains with great bitterness of soul, that by the tyrannical cruelty of his enemies he was prevented from entering the tabernacle (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p40.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#000">Ps. 84</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p40.4"></A>). To many the complaint seems childish, as if no great loss were sustained, not much pleasure lost, by exclusion from the temple, provided other amusements were enjoyed. David, however, laments this one 				deprivation, as filling him with anxiety and sadness, tormenting, and almost destroying him. This he does because there is nothing on which believers set a higher value than on this aid, by which God gradually raises his people to heaven. For it is to be observed, that he always exhibited himself to the holy patriarchs in the mirror of his doctrine in such a way as to make their knowledge spiritual. Whence the temple is not only styled his face, but also, for the purpose of removing all 				superstition, is termed his footstool (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p40.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#007">Ps. 132:7</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p40.5"></A>; 99:5). Herein is the unity of the faith happily realised, when all, from the highest to the lowest, aspire to the head. All the temples which the Gentiles built to God with a different intention were a mere profanation of his worship,&#8212;a profanation into which the Jews also fell, though not with equal grossness. With this Stephen upbraids them in the words of Isaiah when he says, &#8220;Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as 				saith the Prophet, Heaven is my throne,&#8221; &c. (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p40.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#048">Acts 7:48</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p40.6"></A>). For God only consecrates temples to their legitimate use by his word. And when we rashly attempt anything without his order, immediately setting out from a bad principle, we introduce adventitious fictions, by which evil is propagated without measure. It was inconsiderate in Xerxes when, by the advice of the magians, he burnt or pulled down all the temples of Greece, because he thought it absurd that God, to whom all things ought to 				be free and open, should be enclosed by walls and roofs, as if it were not in the power of God in a manner to descend to us, that he may be near to us, and yet neither change his place nor affect us by earthly means, but rather, by a kind of vehicles, raise us aloft to his own heavenly glory, which, with its immensity, fills all things, and in height is above the heavens.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p41"></A>6. Moreover, as at this time there is a great dispute as to the efficacy of the ministry, some extravagantly overrating its dignity, and others erroneously maintaining, that what is peculiar to the Spirit of God is transferred to mortal man, when we suppose that ministers and teachers penetrate to the mind and heart, so as to correct the blindness of the one, and the hardness of the other; it is necessary to place this controversy on its proper footing. The arguments 				on both sides will be disposed of without trouble, by distinctly attending to the passages in which God, the author of preaching, connects his Spirit with it, and then promises a beneficial result; or, on the other hand, to the passages in which God, separating himself from external means, claims for himself alone both the commencement and the whole course of faith. The office of the second Elias was, as Malachi declares, to &#8220;turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the 				children to their fathers&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006">Mal. 4:6</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.1"></A>). Christ declares that he sent the Apostles to produce fruit from his labours (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016">John 15:16</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.2"></A>). What this fruit is Peter briefly defines, when he says that we are begotten again of incorruptible seed (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023">1 Pet. 1:23</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.3"></A>). Hence Paul glories, that by means of the Gospel he had begotten the Corinthians, who were the seals of his apostleship (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015">1 Cor. 4:15</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.4"></A>); moreover, that his was not a ministry of the letter, which only sounded in the ear, but that the effectual agency of 				the Spirit was given to him, in order that his doctrine might not be in vain (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#002">1 Cor. 9:2</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.5"></A>; <a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006">2 Cor. 3:6</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.6"></A>). In this sense he elsewhere declares that his Gospel was not in word, but in power (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.7"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005">1 Thess. 1:5</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.7"></A>). He also affirms that the Galatians received the Spirit by the hearing of faith (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.8"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002">Gal. 3:2</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.8"></A>). In short, in several passages he not only makes himself a fellow-worker with God, but attributes to himself the province of bestowing salvation (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.9"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009">1 Cor. 3:9</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.9"></A>). All these things he certainly never uttered with 				the view of attributing to himself one iota apart from God, as he elsewhere briefly explains. &#8220;For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.10"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013">1 Thess. 2:13</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.10"></A>). Again, in another place, &#8220;He that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the 				Gentiles&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.11"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#008">Gal. 2:8</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.11"></A>). And that he allows no more to ministers is obvious from other passages. &#8220;So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.12"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#007">1 Cor. 3:7</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.12"></A>). Again, &#8220;I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.13"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#010">1 Cor. 15:10</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p41.13"></A>). And it is indeed necessary to keep these sentences in view, since God, in ascribing to himself the illumination of the mind and renewal of the heart, reminds us that 				it is sacrilege for man to claim any part of either to himself. Still every one who listens with docility to the ministers whom God appoints, will know by the beneficial result, that for good reason God is pleased with this method of teaching, and for good reason has laid believers under this modest yoke.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p42"></A>7. The judgment which ought to be formed concerning the visible Church which comes under our observation, must, I think, be sufficiently clear from what has been said. I have observed that the Scriptures speak of the Church in two ways. Sometimes when they speak of the Church they mean the Church as it really is before God&#8212;the Church into which none are admitted but those who by the gift of adoption are sons of God, and by the sanctification of the Spirit true members 				of Christ. In this case it not only comprehends the saints who dwell on the earth, but all the elect who have existed from the beginning of the world. Often, too, by the name of Church is designated the whole body of mankind scattered throughout the world, who profess to worship one God and Christ, who by baptism are initiated into the faith; by partaking of the Lord&#8217;s Supper profess unity in true doctrine and charity, agree in holding the word of the Lord, and observe the ministry which Christ 				has appointed for the preaching of it. In this Church there is a very large mixture of hypocrites, who have nothing of Christ but the name and outward appearance: of ambitious, avaricious, envious, evil-speaking men, some also of impurer lives, who are tolerated for a time, either because their guilt cannot be legally established, or because due strictness of discipline is not always observed. Hence, as it is necessary to believe the invisible Church, 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_514"></A><A HREF="#fn_514"><FONT SIZE="1">515</FONT></A>
 				which is manifest to the eye of God only, so we are also enjoined to regard this Church which is so called with reference to man, and to cultivate its communion.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p44"></A>8. Accordingly, inasmuch as it was of importance to us to recognise it, the Lord has distinguished it by certain marks, and as it were symbols. It is, indeed, the special prerogative of God to know those who are his, as Paul declares in the passage already quoted (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p44.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019">2 Tim. 2:19</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p44.1"></A>). And doubtless it has been so provided as a check on human rashness, the experience of every day reminding us how far his secret judgments surpass our apprehension. For even those who seemed most 				abandoned, and who had been completely despaired of, are by his goodness recalled to life, while those who seemed most stable often fall. Hence, as Augustine says, &#8220;In regard to the secret predestination of God, there are very many sheep without, and very many wolves within&#8221; (August. Hom. in Joan. 45). For he knows, and has his mark on those who know neither him nor themselves. Of those again who openly bear his badge, his eyes alone see who of them are unfeignedly holy, and will persevere even 				to the end, which alone is the completion of salvation. On the other hand, foreseeing that it was in some degree expedient for us to know who are to be regarded by us as his sons, he has in this matter accommodated himself to our capacity. But as here full certainty was not necessary, he has in its place substituted the judgment of charity, by which we acknowledge all as members of the Church who by confession of faith, regularity of conduct, and participation in the sacraments, unite with us 				in acknowledging the same God and Christ. 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_515"></A><A HREF="#fn_515"><FONT SIZE="1">516</FONT></A>
 				The knowledge of his body, inasmuch as he knew it to be more necessary for our salvation, he has made known to us by surer marks.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p46"></A>9. Hence the form of the Church appears and stands forth conspicuous to our view. Wherever we see the word of God sincerely preached and heard, wherever we see the sacraments administered according to the institution of Christ, there we cannot have any doubt that the Church of God has some existence, since his promise cannot fail, &#8220;Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p46.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#020">Mt. 18:20</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p46.1"></A>). But that we may have a clear summary of 				this subject, we must proceed by the following steps:&#8212;The Church universal is the multitude collected out of all nations, who, though dispersed and far distant from each other, agree in one truth of divine doctrine, and are bound together by the tie of a common religion. In this way it comprehends single churches, which exist in different towns and villages, according to the wants of human society, so that each of them justly obtains the name and authority of the Church; and also comprehends 				single individuals, who by a religious profession are accounted to belong to such churches, although they are in fact aliens from the Church, but have not been cut off by a public decision. There is, however, a slight difference in the mode of judging of individuals and of churches. For it may happen in practice that those whom we deem not altogether worthy of the fellowship of believers, we yet ought to treat as brethren, and regard as believers, on account of the common consent of the Church 				in tolerating and bearing with them in the body of Christ. Such persons we do not approve by our suffrage as members of the Church, but we leave them the place which they hold among the people of God, until they are legitimately deprived of it. With regard to the general body we must feel differently; if they have the ministry of the word, and honour the administration of the sacraments, they are undoubtedly entitled to be ranked with the Church, because it is certain that these things are not 				without a beneficial result. Thus we both maintain the Church universal in its unity, which malignant minds have always been eager to dissever, and deny not due authority to lawful assemblies distributed as circumstances require. 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_516"></A><A HREF="#fn_516"><FONT SIZE="1">517</FONT></A>
 			</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p48"></A>10. We have said that the symbols by which the Church is discerned are the preaching of the word and the observance of the sacraments, for these cannot anywhere exist without producing fruit and prospering by the blessing of God. I say not that wherever the word is preached fruit immediately appears; but that in every place where it is received, and has a fixed abode, it uniformly displays its efficacy. Be this as it may, when the preaching of the gospel is reverently 				heard, and the sacraments are not neglected, there for the time the face of the Church appears without deception or ambiguity and no man may with impunity spurn her authority, or reject her admonitions, or resist her counsels, or make sport of her censures, far less revolt from her, and violate her unity (see Chap. 2 sec. 1, 10, and Chap. 8 sec. 12). For such is the value which the Lord sets on the communion of his Church, that all who contumaciously alienate themselves from any Christian 				society, in which the true ministry of his word and sacraments is maintained, he regards as deserters of religion. So highly does he recommend her authority, that when it is violated he considers that his own authority is impaired. For there is no small weight in the designation given to her, &#8220;the house of God,&#8221; &#8220;the pillar and ground of the truth&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p48.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015">1 Tim. 3:15</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p48.1"></A>). By these words Paul intimates, that to prevent the truth from perishing in the world. the Church is its faithful guardian, because 				God has been pleased to preserve the pure preaching of his word by her instrumentality, and to exhibit himself to us as a parent while he feeds us with spiritual nourishment, and provides whatever is conducive to our salvation. Moreover, no mean praise is conferred on the Church when she is said to have been chosen and set apart by Christ as his spouse, &#8220;not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p48.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027">Eph. 5:27</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p48.2"></A>), as &#8220;his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p48.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023">Eph. 1:23</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p48.3"></A>). Whence it 				follows, that revolt from the Church is denial of God and Christ. Wherefore there is the more necessity to beware of a dissent so iniquitous; for seeing by it we aim as far as in us lies at the destruction of God&#8217;s truth, we deserve to be crushed by the full thunder of his anger. No crime can be imagined more atrocious than that of sacrilegiously and perfidiously violating the sacred marriage which the only begotten Son of God has condescended to contract with us.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p49"></A>11. Wherefore let these marks be carefully impressed upon our minds, and let us estimate them as in the sight of the Lord. There is nothing on which Satan is more intent than to destroy and efface one or both of them&#8212;at one time to delete and abolish these marks, and thereby destroy the true and genuine distinction of the Church; at another, to bring them into contempt, and so hurry us into open revolt from the Church. To his wiles it was owing that for several ages 				the pure preaching of the word disappeared, and now, with the same dishonest aim, he labours to overthrow the ministry, which, however, Christ has so ordered in his Church, that if it is removed the whole edifice must fall. How perilous, then, nay, how fatal the temptation, when we even entertain a thought of separating ourselves from that assembly in which are beheld the signs and badges which the Lord has deemed sufficient to characterise his Church! We see how great caution should be 				employed in both respects. That we may not be imposed upon by the name of Church, every congregation which claims the name must be brought to that test as to a Lydian stone. If it holds the order instituted by the Lord in word and sacraments there will be no deception; we may safely pay it the honour due to a church: on the other hand, if it exhibit itself without word and sacraments, we must in this case be no less careful to avoid the imposture than we were to shun pride and presumption in 				the other.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p50"></A>12. When we say that the pure ministry of the word and pure celebration of the sacraments is a fit pledge and earnest, so that we may safely recognise a church in every society in which both exist, our meaning is, that we are never to discard it so long as these remain, though it may otherwise teem with numerous faults. Nay, even in the administration of word and sacraments defects may creep in which ought not to alienate us from its communion. For all the heads of 				true doctrine are not in the same position. Some are so necessary to be known, that all must hold them to be fixed and undoubted as the proper essentials of religion: for instance, that God is one, that Christ is God, and the Son of God, that our salvation depends on the mercy of God, and the like. Others, again, which are the subject of controversy among the churches, do not destroy the unity of the faith; for why should it be regarded as a ground of dissension between churches, if one, 				without any spirit of contention or perverseness in dogmatising, hold that the soul on quitting the body flies to heaven, and another, without venturing to speak positively as to the abode, holds it for certain that it lives with the Lord?51 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_517"></A><A HREF="#fn_517"><FONT SIZE="1">518</FONT></A>
 				The words of the Apostle are, &#8220;Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p51.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015">Phil. 3:15</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p51.1"></A>). Does he not sufficiently intimate that a difference of opinion as to these matters which are not absolutely necessary, ought not to be a ground of dissension among Christians? The best thing, indeed, is to be perfectly agreed, but seeing there is no man who is not involved in some mist of ignorance, we 				must either have no church at all, or pardon delusion in those things of which one may be ignorant, without violating the substance of religion and forfeiting salvation. Here, however, I have no wish to patronise even the minutest errors, as if I thought it right to foster them by flattery or connivance; what I say is, that we are not on account of every minute difference to abandon a church, provided it retain sound and unimpaired that doctrine in which the safety of piety consists,51 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_518"></A><A HREF="#fn_518"><FONT SIZE="1">519</FONT></A>
 				and keep the use of the sacraments instituted by the Lord. Meanwhile, if we strive to reform what is offensive, we act in the discharge of duty. To this effect are the words of Paul, &#8220;If anything be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p52.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#030">1 Cor. 14:30</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p52.1"></A>). From this it is evident that to each member of the Church, according to his measure of grace, the study of public edification has been assigned, provided it be done decently and in order. In other words, 				we must neither renounce the communion of the Church, nor, continuing in it, disturb peace and discipline when duly arranged.51 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_519"></A><A HREF="#fn_519"><FONT SIZE="1">520</FONT></A>
 			</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p54"></A>13. Our indulgence ought to extend much farther in tolerating imperfection of conduct. Here there is great danger of falling, and Satan employs all his machinations to ensnare us. For there always have been persons who, imbued with a false persuasion of absolute holiness, as if they had already become a kind of a&euml;rial spirits,51 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_520"></A><A HREF="#fn_520"><FONT SIZE="1">521</FONT></A>
 				spurn the society of all in whom they see that something human still remains. Such of old were the Cathari and the Donatists, who were similarly infatuated. Such in the present day are some of the Anabaptists, who would be thought to have made superior progress. Others, again, sin in this respect, not so much from that insane pride as from inconsiderate zeal. Seeing that among those to whom the gospel is preached, the fruit produced is not in accordance with the doctrine, they 				forthwith conclude that there no church exists. The offence is indeed well founded, and it is one to which in this most unhappy age we give far too much occasion. It is impossible to excuse our accursed sluggishness, which the Lord will not leave unpunished, as he is already beginning sharply to chastise us. Woe then to us who, by our dissolute licence of wickedness, cause weak consciences to be wounded! Still those of whom we have spoken sin in their turn, by not knowing how to set bounds to 				their offence. For where the Lord requires mercy they omit it, and give themselves up to immoderate severity. Thinking there is no church where there is not complete purity and integrity of conduct, they, through hatred of wickedness, withdraw from a genuine church, while they think they are shunning the company of the ungodly. They allege that the Church of God is holy. But that they may at the same time understand that it contains a mixture of good and bad, let them hear from the lips of our 				Saviour that parable in which he compares the Church to a net in which all kinds of fishes are taken, but not separated until they are brought ashore. Let them hear it compared to a field which, planted with good seed, is by the fraud of an enemy mingled with tares, and is not freed of them until the harvest is brought into the barn. Let them hear, in fine, that it is a thrashing-floor in which the collected wheat lies concealed under the chaff, until, cleansed by the fanners and the sieve, it 				is at length laid up in the granary. If the Lord declares that the Church will labour under the defect of being burdened with a multitude of wicked until the day of judgment, it is in vain to look for a church altogether free from blemish (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p55.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#000">Mt. 13</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p55.1"></A>).</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p56"></A>14. They exclaim that it is impossible to tolerate the vice which everywhere stalks abroad like a pestilence. What if the apostle&#8217;s sentiment applies here also? Among the Corinthians it was not a few that erred, but almost the whole body had become tainted; there was not one species of sin merely, but a multitude, and those not trivial errors, but some of them execrable crimes. There was not only corruption in manners, but also in doctrine. What course was taken by the 				holy apostle, in other words, by the organ of the heavenly Spirit, by whose testimony the Church stands and falls? Does he seek separation from them? Does he discard them from the kingdom of Christ? Does he strike them with the thunder of a final anathema? He not only does none of these things, but he acknowledges and heralds them as a Church of Christ, and a society of saints. If the Church remains among the Corinthians, where envyings, divisions, and contentions rage; where quarrels, 				lawsuits, and avarice prevail; where a crime, which even the Gentiles would execrate, is openly approved; where the name of Paul, whom they ought to have honoured as a father, is petulantly assailed; where some hold the resurrection of the dead in derision, though with it the whole gospel must fall; where the gifts of God are made subservient to ambition, not to charity; where many things are done neither decently nor in order:52 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_521"></A><A HREF="#fn_521"><FONT SIZE="1">522</FONT></A>
 				If there the Church still remains, simply because the ministration of word and sacrament is not rejected, who will presume to deny the title of church to those to whom a tenth part of these crimes cannot be imputed? How, I ask, would those who act so morosely against present churches have acted to the Galatians, who had done all but abandon the gospel (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p57.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006">Gal. 1:6</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p57.1"></A>), and yet among them the same apostle found churches?52 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_522"></A><A HREF="#fn_522"><FONT SIZE="1">523</FONT></A>
 			</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p59"></A>15. They also object, that Paul sharply rebukes the Corinthians for permitting an heinous offender in their communion, and then lays down a general sentence, by which he declares it unlawful even to eat bread with a man of impure life (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p59.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011">1 Cor. 5:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#012">12</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p59.1"></A>). Here they exclaim, If it is not lawful to eat ordinary bread, how can it be lawful to eat the Lord&#8217;s bread? I admit, that it is a great disgrace if dogs and swine are admitted among the children of God; much more, if 				the sacred body of Christ is prostituted to them. And, indeed, when churches are well regulated, they will not bear the wicked in their bosom, nor will they admit the worthy and unworthy indiscriminately to that sacred feast. But because pastors are not always sedulously vigilant, are sometimes also more indulgent than they ought, or are prevented from acting so strictly as they could wish; the consequence is, that even the openly wicked are not always excluded from the fellowship of the 				saints. This I admit to be a vice, and I have no wish to extenuate it, seeing that Paul sharply rebukes it in the Corinthians. But although the Church fail in her duty, it does not therefore follow that every private individual is to decide the question of separation for himself. I deny not that it is the duty of a pious man to withdraw from all private intercourse with the wicked, and not entangle himself with them by any voluntary tie; but it is one thing to shun the society of the wicked, 				and another to renounce the communion of the Church through hatred of them. Those who think it sacrilege to partake the Lord&#8217;s bread with the wicked, are in this more rigid than Paul.52 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_523"></A><A HREF="#fn_523"><FONT SIZE="1">524</FONT></A>
 				For when he exhorts us to pure and holy communion, he does not require that we should examine others, or that every one should examine the whole church, but that each should examine himself (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p60.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#028">1 Cor. 11:28</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#029">29</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p60.1"></A>). If it were unlawful to communicate with the unworthy, Paul would certainly have ordered us to take heed that there were no individual in the whole body by whose impurity we might be defiled, but now that he only requires each to examine himself, he shows that it does no harm 				to us though some who are unworthy present themselves along with us. To the same effect he afterwards adds, &#8220;He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself.&#8221; He says not <i>to others</i>, but <i>to himself</i>. And justly; for the right of admitting or excluding ought not to be left to the decision of individuals. Cognisance of this point, which cannot be exercised without due order, as shall afterwards be more fully shown, belongs to the whole church. It would 				therefore be unjust to hold any private individual as polluted by the unworthiness of another, whom he neither can nor ought to keep back from communion.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p61"></A> 16. Still, however, even the good are sometimes affected by this inconsiderate zeal for righteousness, though we shall find that this excessive moroseness is more the result of pride and a false idea of sanctity, than genuine sanctity itself, and true zeal for it. Accordingly, those who are the most forward, and, as it were, leaders in producing revolt from the Church, have, for the most part, no other motive than to display their own superiority by despising all 				other men. Well and wisely, therefore, does Augustine say, &#8220;Seeing that pious reason and the mode of ecclesiastical discipline ought specially to regard the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, which the Apostle enjoins us to keep, by bearing with one another (for if we keep it not, the application of medicine is not only superfluous, but pernicious, and therefore proves to be no medicine); those bad sons who, not from hatred of other men&#8217;s iniquities, but zeal for their own contentions, 				attempt altogether to draw away, or at least to divide, weak brethren ensnared by the glare of their name, while swollen with pride, stuffed with petulance, insidiously calumnious, and turbulently seditious, use the cloak of a rigorous severity, that they may not seem devoid of the light of truth, and pervert to sacrilegious schism, and purposes of excision, those things which are enjoined in the Holy Scriptures (due regard being had to sincere love, and the unity of peace), to correct a 				brother&#8217;s faults by the appliance of a moderate cure&#8221; (August. Cont. Parmen. cap. 1). To the pious and placid his advice is, mercifully to correct what they can, and to bear patiently with what they cannot correct, in love lamenting and mourning until God either reform or correct, or at the harvest root up the tares, and scatter the chaff (Ibid. cap. 2). Let all the godly study to provide themselves with these weapons, lest, while they deem themselves strenuous and ardent defenders of 				righteousness, they revolt from the kingdom of heaven, which is the only kingdom of righteousness. For as God has been pleased that the communion of his Church shall be maintained in this external society, any one who, from hatred of the ungodly, violates the bond of this society, enters on a downward course, in which he incurs great danger of cutting himself off from the communion of saints. Let them reflect, that in a numerous body there are several who may escape their notice, and yet are 				truly righteous and innocent in the eyes of the Lord. Let them reflect, that of those who seem diseased, there are many who are far from taking pleasure or flattering themselves in their faults, and who, ever and anon aroused by a serious fear of the Lord, aspire to greater integrity. Let them reflect, that they have no right to pass judgment on a man for one act, since the holiest sometimes make the most grievous fall. Let them reflect, that in the ministry of the word and participation of the 				sacraments, the power to collect the Church is too great to be deprived of all its efficacy, by the fault of some ungodly men. Lastly, let them reflect, that in estimating the Church, divine is of more force than human judgment.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p62"></A>17. Since they also argue that there is good reason for the Church being called holy, it is necessary to consider what the holiness is in which it excels, lest by refusing to acknowledge any church, save one that is completely perfect, we leave no church at all. It is true, indeed, as Paul says, that Christ &#8220;loved the church, and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a 				glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p62.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025">Eph. 5:25-27</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p62.1"></A>). Nevertheless, it is true, that the Lord is daily smoothing its wrinkles, and wiping away its spots. Hence it follows, that its holiness is not yet perfect. Such, then, is the holiness of the Church: it makes daily progress, but is not yet perfect; it daily advances, but as yet has not reached the goal, as will elsewhere be more fully explained. Therefore, when the 				Prophets foretel, &#8220;Then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more;&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;It shall be called, The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p62.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#017">Joel 3:17</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p62.2"></A>; <a name="iv.iv.ii-p62.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008">Isa. 35:8</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p62.3"></A>), let us not understand it as if no blemish remained in the members of the Church: but only that with there whole heart they aspire after holiness and perfect purity: and hence, that purity which they have not yet fully attained is, by the kindness of God, attributed to them. And though the 				indications of such a kind of holiness existing among men are too rare, we must understand, that at no period since the world began has the Lord been without his Church, nor ever shall be till the final consummation of all things. 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_524"></A><A HREF="#fn_524"><FONT SIZE="1">525</FONT></A>
 				For although, at the very outset, the whole human race was vitiated and corrupted by the sin of Adam, yet of this kind of polluted mass he always sanctifies some vessels to honour, that no age may be left without experience of his mercy. This he has declared by sure promises, such as the following: &#8220;I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p63.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003">Ps. 89:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#004">4</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p63.1"></A>). &#8220;The Lord hath 				chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p63.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013">Ps. 132:13</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014">14</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p63.2"></A>). &#8220;Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The Lord of hosts is his name: If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the Lord, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p63.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035">Jer. 31:35</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#036">36</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p63.3"></A>).</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p64"></A>18. On this head, Christ himself, his apostles, and almost all the prophets, have furnished us with examples. Fearful are the descriptions in which Isaiah, Jeremiah, Joel, Habakkuk, and others, deplore the diseases of the Church of Jerusalem. In the people, the rulers, and the priests, corruption prevailed to such a degree, that Isaiah hesitates not to liken Jerusalem to Sodom and Gomorrah (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p64.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#010">Isa. 1:10</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p64.1"></A>). Religion was partly despised, partly adulterated, while in regard 				to morals, we everywhere meet with accounts of theft, robbery, perfidy, murder, and similar crimes. The prophets, however, did not therefore either form new churches for themselves, or erect new altars on which they might have separate sacrifices, but whatever their countrymen might be, reflecting that the Lord had deposited his word with them, and instituted the ceremonies by which he was then worshipped, they stretched out pure hands to him, though amid the company of the ungodly. Certainly, 				had they thought that they thereby contracted any pollution, they would have died a hundred deaths sooner than suffered themselves to be dragged thither. Nothing, therefore, prevented them from separating themselves, but a desire of preserving unity. But if the holy prophets felt no obligation to withdraw from the Church on account of the very numerous and heinous crimes, not of one or two individuals, but almost of the whole people, we arrogate too much to ourselves, if we presume forthwith to 				withdraw from the communion of the Church, because the lives of all accord not with our judgment, or even with the Christian profession.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p65"></A>19. Then what kind of age was that of Christ and the apostles? Yet neither could the desperate impiety of the Pharisees, nor the dissolute licentiousness of manners which everywhere prevailed, prevent them from using the same sacred rites with the people, and meeting in one common temple for the public exercises of religion. And why so, but just because they knew that those who joined in these sacred rites with a pure conscience were not at all polluted by the society 				of the wicked? If any one is little moved by prophets and apostles, let him at least defer to the authority of Christ. Well, therefore, does Cyprian say, &#8220;Although tares or unclean vessels are seen in the Church, that is no reason why we ourselves should withdraw from the Church; we must only labour that we may be able to be wheat; we must give our endeavour, and strive as far as we can, to be vessels of gold or silver. But to break the earthen vessels belongs to the Lord alone, to whom a rod 				of iron has been given: let no one arrogate to himself what is peculiar to the Son alone, and think himself sufficient to winnow the floor and cleanse the chaff, and separate all the tares by human judgment. What depraved zeal thus assumes to itself is proud obstinacy and sacrilegious presumption&#8221; (Cyprian, Lib. 3 Ep. 5). Let both points, therefore, be regarded as fixed; <i>first</i>, that there is no excuse for him who spontaneously abandons the external communion of a church in which the word 				of God is preached and the sacraments are administered; <i>secondly</i>, that notwithstanding of the faults of a few or of many, there is nothing to prevent us from there duly professing our faith in the ordinances instituted by God, because a pious conscience is not injured by the unworthiness of another, whether he be a pastor or a private individual; and sacred rites are not less pure and salutary to a man who is holy and upright, from being at the same time handled by the impure.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p66"></A>20. Their moroseness and pride proceed even to greater lengths. Refusing to acknowledge any church that is not pure from the minutest blemish, they take offence at sound teachers for exhorting believers to make progress, and so teaching them to groan during their whole lives under the burden of sin, and flee for pardon. For they preten 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_525"></A><A HREF="#fn_525"><FONT SIZE="1">526</FONT></A>
 				that in this way believers are led away from perfection. I admit that we are not to labour feebly or coldly in urging perfection, far less to desist from urging it; but I hold that it is a device of the devil to fill our minds with a confident belief of it while we are still in our course. Accordingly, in the Creed forgiveness of sins is appropriately subjoined to belief as to the Church, because none obtain forgiveness but those who are citizens, and of the household of the Church, 				as we read in the Prophet (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p67.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#024">Is. 33:24</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p67.1"></A>). The first place, therefore, should be given to the building of the heavenly Jerusalem, in which God afterwards is pleased to wipe away the iniquity of all who betake themselves to it. I say, however, that the Church must first be built; not that there can be any church without forgiveness of sins, but because the Lord has not promised his mercy save in the communion of saints. Therefore, our first entrance into the Church and the kingdom of God is by 				forgiveness of sins, without which we have no covenant nor union with God. For thus he speaks by the Prophet, &#8220;In that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow, and the sword, and the battle, out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely. And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in 				loving-kindness, and in mercies&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p67.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018">Hos. 2:18</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019">19</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p67.2"></A>). We see in what way the Lord reconciles us to himself by his mercy. So in another passage, where he foretells that the people whom he had scattered in anger will again be gathered together, &#8220;I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p67.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#008">Jer. 33:8</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p67.3"></A>). Wherefore, our initiation into the fellowship of the Church is, by the symbol of ablution, to teach us that we have no admission into the family of God, unless by 				his goodness our impurities are previously washed away.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p68"></A>21. Nor by remission of sins does the Lord only once for all elect and admit us into the Church, but by the same means he preserves and defends us in it. For what would it avail us to receive a pardon of which we were afterwards to have no use? That the mercy of the Lord would be vain and delusive if only granted once, all the godly can bear witness; for there is none who is not conscious, during his whole life, of many infirmities which stand in need of divine mercy. 				And truly it is not without cause that the Lord promises this gift specially to his own household, nor in vain that he orders the same message of reconciliation to be daily delivered to them. Wherefore, as during our whole lives we carry about with us the remains of sin, we could not continue in the Church one single moment were we not sustained by the uninterrupted grace of God in forgiving our sins. On the other hand, the Lord has called his people to eternal salvation, and therefore they 				ought to consider that pardon for their sins is always ready. Hence let us surely hold that if we are admitted and ingrafted into the body of the Church, the forgiveness of sins has been bestowed, and is daily bestowed on us, in divine liberality, through the intervention of Christ&#8217;s merits, and the sanctification of the Spirit.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p69"></A>22. To impart this blessing to us, the keys have been given to the Church (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p69.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019">Mt. 16:19</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p69.1"></A>; 18:18). For when Christ gave the command to the apostles, and conferred the power of forgiving sins, he not merely intended that they should loose the sins of those who should be converted from impiety to the faith of Christ;52 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_526"></A><A HREF="#fn_526"><FONT SIZE="1">527</FONT></A>
 				but, moreover, that they should perpetually perform this office among believers. This Paul teaches, when he says that the embassy of reconciliation has been committed to the ministers of the Church, that they may ever and anon in the name of Christ exhort the people to be reconciled to God (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p70.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020">2 Cor. 5:20</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p70.1"></A>). Therefore, in the communion of saints our sins are constantly forgiven by the ministry of the Church, when presbyters or bishops, to whom the office has been committed, confirm 				pious consciences, in the hope of pardon and forgiveness by the promises of the gospel, and that as well in public as in private, as the case requires. For there are many who, from their infirmity, stand in need of special pacification, and Paul declares that he testified of the grace of Christ not only in the public assembly, but from house to house, reminding each individually of the doctrine of salvation (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p70.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020">Acts 20:20</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#021">21</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p70.2"></A>). Three things are here to be observed. First, Whatever be the holiness 				which the children of God possess, it is always under the condition, that so long as they dwell in a mortal body, they cannot stand before God without forgiveness of sins. Secondly, This benefit is so peculiar to the Church, that we cannot enjoy it unless we continue in the communion of the Church. Thirdly, It is dispensed to us by the ministers and pastors of the Church, either in the preaching of the Gospel or the administration of the Sacraments, and herein is especially manifested the power 				of the keys, which the Lord has bestowed on the company of the faithful. Accordingly, let each of us consider it to be his duty to seek forgiveness of sins only where the Lord has placed it. Of the public reconciliation which relates to discipline, we shall speak at the proper place.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p71"></A>23. But since those frantic spirits of whom I have spoken attempt to rob the Church of this the only anchor of salvation, consciences must be more firmly strengthened against this pestilential opinion. The Novatians, in ancient times, agitated the Churches with this dogma, but in our day, not unlike the Novatians are some of the Anabaptists, who have fallen into the same delirious dreams. For they pretend that in baptism, the people of God are regenerated to a pure and 				angelical life, which is not polluted by any carnal defilements. But if a man sin after baptism, they leave him nothing except the inexorable judgment of God. In short, to the sinner who has lapsed after receiving grace they give no hope of pardon, because they admit no other forgiveness of sins save that by which we are first regenerated. But although no falsehood is more clearly refuted by Scripture, yet as these men find means of imposition (as Novatus also of old had very many followers), 				let us briefly show how much they rave, to the destruction both of themselves and others. In the first place, since by the command of our Lord the saints daily repeat this prayer, &#8220;Forgive us our debts&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p71.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012">Mt. 6:12</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p71.1"></A>), they confess that they are debtors. Nor do they ask in vain; for the Lord has only enjoined them to ask what he will give. Nay, while he has declared that the whole prayer will be heard by his Father, he has sealed this absolution with a peculiar promise. What more do we wish? The 				Lord requires of his saints confession of sins during their whole lives, and that without ceasing, and promises pardon. How presumptuous, then, to exempt them from sin, or when they have stumbled, to exclude them altogether from grace? Then whom does he enjoin us to pardon seventy and seven times? Is it not our brethren? (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p71.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#022">Mt. 18:22</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p71.2"></A>) And why has he so enjoined but that we may imitate his clemency? He therefore pardons not once or twice only, but as often as, under a sense of our faults, we feel 				alarmed, and sighing call upon him.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p72"></A>24. And to begin almost with the very first commencement of the Church: the Patriarchs had been circumcised, admitted to a participation in the covenant, and doubtless instructed by their father&#8217;s care in righteousness and integrity, when they conspired to commit fratricide. The crime was one which the most abandoned robbers would have abominated.52 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_527"></A><A HREF="#fn_527"><FONT SIZE="1">528</FONT></A>
 				At length, softened by the remonstrances of Judah, they sold him; this also was intolerable cruelty. Simeon and Levi took a nefarious revenge on the sons of Sychem, one, too, condemned by the judgment of their father. Reuben, with execrable lust, defiled his father&#8217;s bed. Judah, when seeking to commit whoredom, sinned against the law of nature with his daughter-in-law. But so far are they from being expunged from the chosen people, that they are rather raised to be its heads. What, 				moreover, of David? when on the throne of righteousness, with what iniquity did he make way for blind lust, by the shedding of innocent blood? He had already been regenerated, and, as one of the regenerated, received distinguished approbation from the Lord. But he perpetrated a crime at which even the Gentiles would have been horrified, and yet obtained pardon. And not to dwell on special examples, all the promises of divine mercy extant in the Law and the Prophets are so many proofs that the 				Lord is ready to forgive the offences of his people. For why does Moses promise a future period, when the people who had fallen into rebellion should return to the Lord? &#8220;Then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p73.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003">Deut. 30:3</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p73.3"></A>).</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p74"></A>25. But I am unwilling to begin an enumeration which never could be finished. The prophetical books are filled with similar promises, offering mercy to a people covered with innumerable transgressions. What crime is more heinous than rebellion? It is styled divorce between God and the Church, and yet, by his goodness, it is surmounted. They say, &#8220;If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man&#8217;s, shall he return unto her again? shall not that 				land be greatly polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again unto me, saith the Lord.&#8221; &#8220;Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, saith the Lord, and I will not keep anger for ever&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p74.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001">Jer. 3:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012">12</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p74.1"></A>). And surely he could not have a different feeling who declares, &#8220;I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth;&#8221; &#8220;Wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p74.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#023">Ezek. 18:23</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#032">32</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p74.2"></A>). Accordingly, when 				Solomon dedicated the temple, one of the uses for which it was destined was, that prayers offered up for the pardon of sins might there be heard. &#8220;If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy, far or near; yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them 				that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness; and so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies which led them away captive, and pray unto thee towards their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name: then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling-place, and maintain their 				cause, and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p74.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#046">1 Kings 8:46-50</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p74.3"></A>). Nor in vain in the Law did God ordain a daily sacrifice for sins. Had he not foreseen that his people were constantly to labour under the disease of sin, he never would have appointed these remedies.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p75"></A>26. Did the advent of Christ, by which the fulness of grace was displayed, deprive believers of this privilege of supplicating for the pardon of their sins? If they offended against the Lord, were they not to obtain any mercy? What were it but to say that Christ came not for the salvation, but for the destruction of his people, if the divine indulgence in pardoning sin, which was constantly provided for the saints under the Old Testament, is now declared to have been 				taken away? But if we give credit to the Scriptures, when distinctly proclaiming that in Christ alone the grace and loving-kindness of the Lord have fully appeared, the riches of his mercy been poured out, reconciliation between God and man accomplished (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p75.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011">Tit. 2:11</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p75.1"></A>; 3:4; <a name="iv.iv.ii-p75.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009">2 Tim. 1:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010">10</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p75.2"></A>), let us not doubt that the clemency of our heavenly Father, instead of being cut off or curtailed, is in much greater exuberance. Nor are proofs of this wanting. Peter, who had heard our Saviour declare that he 				who did not confess his name before men would be denied before the angels of God, denied him thrice in one night, and not without execration; yet he is not denied pardon (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p75.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038">Mark 8:38</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p75.3"></A>). Those who lived disorderly among the Thessalonians, though chastised, are still invited to repentance (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p75.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006">2 Thess. 3:6</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p75.4"></A>). Not even is Simon Magus thrown into despair. He is rather told to hope, since Peter invites him to have recourse to prayer (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p75.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#022">Acts 8:22</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p75.5"></A>).</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p76"></A>27. What shall we say to the fact, that occasionally whole churches have been implicated in the grossest sins, and yet Paul, instead of giving them over to destruction, rather mercifully extricated them? The defection of the Galatians was no trivial fault; the Corinthians were still less excusable, the iniquities prevailing among them being more numerous and not less heinous, yet neither are excluded from the mercy of the Lord. Nay, the very persons who had sinned 				above others in uncleanness and fornication are expressly invited to repentance. The covenant of the Lord remains, and ever will remain, inviolable, that covenant which he solemnly ratified with Christ the true Solomon, and his members, in these words: &#8220;If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; if they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I 				not utterly take from him&#8221; (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p76.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030">Ps. 89:30-33</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p76.1"></A>). In short, by the very arrangement of the Creed, we are reminded that forgiveness of sins always resides in the Church of Christ, for after the Church is as it were constituted, forgiveness of sins is subjoined.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p77"></A>28. Some persons who have somewhat more discernment, seeing that the dogma of Novatus is so clearly refuted in Scripture, do not make every fault unpardonable, but that voluntary transgression of the Law into which a man falls knowingly and willingly. Those who speak thus allow pardon to those sins only that have been committed through ignorance. But since the Lord has in the Law ordered some sacrifices to be offered in expiation of the voluntary sins of believers, and 				others to redeem sins of ignorance (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p77.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#000">Lev. 4</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p77.1"></A>), how perverse is it to concede no expiation to a voluntary sin? I hold nothing to be more plain, than that the one sacrifice of Christ avails to remit the voluntary sins of believers, the Lord having attested this by carnal sacrifices as emblems. Then how is David, who was so well instructed in the Law, to be excused by ignorance? Did David, who was daily punishing it in others, not know how heinous a crime murder and adultery was? Did the patriarchs 				deem fratricide a lawful act? Had the Corinthians made so little proficiency as to imagine that God was pleased with lasciviousness, impurity, whoredom, hatred, and strife? Was Peter, after being so carefully warned, ignorant how heinous it was to forswear his Master? Therefore, let us not by our malice shut the door against the divine mercy, when so benignly manifested.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p78"></A>29. I am not unaware, that by the sins which are daily forgiven to believers, ancient writers have understood the lighter errors which creep in through the infirmity of the flesh, while they thought that the formal repentance which was then exacted for more heinous crimes was no more to be repeated than Baptism. This opinion is not to be viewed as if they wished to plunge those into despair who had fallen from their first repentance, or to extenuate those errors as if 				they were of no account before God. For they knew that the saints often stumble through unbelief, that superfluous oaths occasionally escape them, that they sometimes boil with anger, nay, break out into open invectives, and labour, besides, under other evils, which are in no slight degree offensive to the Lord; but they so called them to distinguish them from public crimes, which came under the cognisance of the Church, and produced much scandal.52 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_528"></A><A HREF="#fn_528"><FONT SIZE="1">529</FONT></A>
 				The great difficulty they had in pardoning those who had done something that called for ecclesiastical animadversion, was not because they thought it difficult to obtain pardon from the Lord, but by this severity they wished to deter others from rushing precipitately into crimes, which, by their demerit, would alienate them from the communion of the Church. Still the word of the Lord, which here ought to be our only rule, certainly prescribes greater moderation, since it teaches 				that the rigour of discipline must not be stretched so far as to overwhelm with grief the individual for whose benefit it should specially be designed (<a name="iv.iv.ii-p79.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#007">2 Cor. 2:7</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p79.1"></A>), as we have above discoursed at greater length.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="iv.iv.ii-p35"></A>103 D103 Here Calvin provides a basis for the concept, &#8220;the invisible Church.&#8221; The term &#8220;invisible&#8221; refers to the fact that a knowledge of those who are truly members of Christ&#8217;s body is known to God alone and cannot with certainty be ascertained by men (except for themselves, through their effectual calling).

The expression, &#8220;visible Church&#8221; refers to the Church as it is seen by the eyes of fallible men. From this standpoint, since only the Lord &#8220;knows them that are His,&#8221; it is possible to have (and sometimes discover) deceived persons and hypocrites in the church&#8212;those who are not truly members of Christ&#8217;s body. This mixed state 					 of affairs forms part of the warrant for Church discipline. (see also section 7)</p> 				</P>
