<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p1"></A>66. God keeps us united in the fellowship of Christ by means of Ecclesiastical and Civil government.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p2"></A>67. In Ecclesiastical government Three things are considered. 1. What is the Church? 2. How is it governed? 3. What is its power?</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p3"></A>68. The Church is regarded in two points of view; as Invisible and Universal, which is the communion of saints; and as Visible and Particular. The Church is discerned by the pure preaching of the word, and by the lawful administration of the sacraments.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p4"></A>69. As to the government of the Church, there are Five points of inquiry. 1. Who rule? 2. What are they? 3. What is their calling? 4. What is their office? 5. What was the condition of the ancient Church?</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p5"></A>70. They that rule are not Angels, but Men. In this respect, God declares his condescension towards us: we have a most excellent training to humility and obedience, and it is singularly fitted to bind us to mutual charity.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p6"></A>71. These are Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, whose office was temporary; Pastors and Teachers, whose office is of perpetual duration.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p7"></A>72. Their calling is twofold; <i>internal</i> and <i>external</i>. The <i>internal</i> is from the Spirit of God. In the <i>external</i> there are Four things to be considered. 1. What sort of persons ought to be chosen? Men of sound doctrine and holy lives. 2. In what manner? With fasting and prayer. 3. By whom? Immediately, by God, as Prophets and Apostles. Mediately, with the direction of the word, by Bishops, by Elders, and by the people. 4. With what rite of 			 ordination? By the laying on of hands, the use of which is threefold. 1. That the dignity of the ministry may be commended. 2. That he who is called may know that he is devoted to God. 3. That he may believe that the Holy Spirit will not desert this holy ministry.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p8"></A>73. The duty of Pastors in the Church is, to preach the Word, to administer the Sacraments, to exercise Discipline.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p9"></A>74. The condition of the ancient Church was distributed into Presbyters, Elders, Deacons, who dispensed the funds of the Church to the Bishops, the Clergy, the poor, and for repairing churches.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p10"></A>75. The power of the Church is viewed in relation to Doctrine, Legislation, and Jurisdiction.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p11"></A>76. Doctrine respects the articles of faith, none of which must be laid down without the authority of the word of God, but all must be directed to the glory of God and the edification of the Church. It respects also the application of the articles, which must agree with the analogy of faith.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p12"></A>77. Ecclesiastical laws, in precepts necessary to be observed, must be in accordance with the written word of God. In things indifferent, regard must be had to places, persons, times, with a due attention to order and decorum. Those constitutions ought to be avoided which have been laid down by pretended pastors instead of the pure worship of God, which bind the consciences by rigid necessity, which make void a commandment of God, which are useless and trifling, which 			 oppress the consciences by their number, which lead to theatrical display, which are considered to be propitiatory sacrifices, and which are turned to the purposes of gain.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p13"></A>78. Jurisdiction is twofold. 1. That which belongs to the Clergy, which was treated of under the head of Provincial and General Synods. 2. That which is common to the Clergy and the people, the design of which is twofold, that scandals may be prevented, and that scandal which has arisen may be removed. The exercise of it consists in private and public admonitions, and likewise in excommunication, the object of which is threefold. 1. That the Church may not be blamed; 2. 			 That the good may not be corrupted by intercourse with the bad; 3. That they who are excommunicated may be ashamed, and may begin to repent.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p14"></A>79. With regard to Times, Fasts are appointed, and Vows are made. The design of Fasts is, that the flesh may be mortified, that we may be better prepared for prayer, and that they may be evidences of humility and obedience. They consist of Three things, the time, the quality, and the quantity of food. But here we must beware lest we rend our garments only, and not our hearts, as hypocrites do, lest those actions be regarded as a meritorious performance, and lest they be 			 too rigorously demanded as necessary to salvation.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p15"></A>80. In Vows we must consider; 1. To whom the vow is made&oacute;namely, to God. Hence it follows that nothing must be attempted but what is approved by his word, which teaches us what is pleasing and what is displeasing to God. 2. Who it is that vows&oacute;namely, a man. We must, therefore, beware lest we disregard our liberty, or promise what is beyond our strength or inconsistent with our calling. 3. What is vowed. Here regard must be had to time; to the <i>past</i>, such as a vow 			 of thanksgiving and repentance; to the <i>future</i>, that we may afterwards be more cautious, and may be stimulated by them to the performance of duty. Hence it is evident what opinion we ought to form respecting Popish vows.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p16"></A>81. In explaining the Sacraments, there are Three things to be considered. 1. What a sacrament is;&oacute;namely, an external sign, by which God seals on our consciences the promises of his good-will towards us, in order to sustain the weakness of our faith. We in our turn testify our piety towards him. 2. What things are necessary;&oacute;namely, the Sign, the Thing signified, the Promise, and the general Participation. 3. What is the number of them;&oacute;namely, Baptism and the Lord&iacute;s 			 Supper.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p17"></A>82. The Sign in Baptism is water; the Thing Signified is the blood of Christ; the Promise is eternal life; the Communicants or Partakers are, adults, after making a confession of their faith, and likewise infants; for Baptism came in the place of Circumcision, and in both the mystery, promise, use, and efficacy, are the same. Forgiveness of sins also belongs to infants, and therefore it is likewise a sign of this forgiveness.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p18"></A>83. The end of Baptism is twofold. 1. To promote our faith towards God. For it is a sign of our washing by the blood of Christ, and of the mortification of our flesh, and the renewal of our souls in Christ. Besides, being united to Christ, we believe that we shall be partakers of all his blessings, and that we shall never fall under condemnation. 2. To serve as our confession before our neighbour; for it is a mark that we choose to be regarded as the people of God, and 			 we testify that we profess the Christian religion, and that our desire is, that all the members of our body may proclaim the praise of God.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p19"></A>84. The Lord&iacute;s Supper is a spiritual feast, by which we are preserved in that life into which God hath begotten us by his word.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p20"></A>85. The design of the Lord&iacute;s Supper is threefold. 1. To aid in confirming our faith towards God. 2. To serve as a confession before men. 3. To be an exhortation to charity.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p21"></A>86. We must beware lest, by undervaluing the signs, we separate them too much from their mysteries, with which they are in some measure connected; and lest, on the other hand, by immoderately extolling them, we appear to obscure the mysteries themselves.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p22"></A>87. The parts are two. 1. The <i>spiritual truth</i> in which the meaning is beheld, consists in the promises; the <i>matter</i>, or substance, is Christ dead and risen; and the <i>effect</i> is our redemption and justification. 2. The visible signs are, bread and wine.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p23"></A>88. With the Lord&iacute;s Supper is contrasted the Popish Mass. 1. It offers insult and blasphemy to Christ. 2. It buries the cross of Christ. 3. It obliterates his death. 4. It robs us of the benefits which we obtain in Christ. 5. It destroys the Sacraments in which the memorial of his death was left.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p24"></A>89. The Sacraments, falsely so called, are enumerated, which are, Confirmation, Penitence, Extreme Unction, Orders [which gave rise to the (seven) less and the (three) greater], and Marriage.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p25"></A>90. Next comes Civil government, which belongs to the external regulation of manners.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p26"></A>91. Under this head are considered Magistrates, Laws, and the People.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p27"></A>92. The Magistrate is God&iacute;s vicegerent, the father of his country, the guardian of the laws, the administrator of justice, the defender of the Church.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p28"></A>93. By these names he is excited to the performance of duty. 1. That he may walk in holiness before God, and before men may maintain uprightness, prudence, temperance, harmlessness, and righteousness. 2. That by wonderful consolation it may smooth the difficulties of his office.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p29"></A>94. The kinds of Magistracy or Civil Government are, Monarchy, Aristocracy, Democracy.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p30"></A>95. As to Laws, we must see what is their constitution in regard to God and to men: and what is their equity in regard to times, places, and nations.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p31"></A>96. The People owe to the Magistrate, 1. Reverence heartily rendered to him as God&iacute;s ambassador. 2. Obedience, or compliance with edicts, or paying taxes, or undertaking public offices and burdens. 3. That love which will lead us to pray to God for his prosperity.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p32"></A>97. We are enjoined to obey not only good magistrates, but all who possess authority, though they may exercise tyranny; for it was not without the authority of God that they were appointed to be princes.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p33"></A>98. When tyrants reign, let us first remember our faults, which are chastised by such scourges; and, therefore, humility will restrain our impatience. Besides, it is not in our power to remedy these evils, and all that remains for us is to implore the assistance of the Lord, in whose hand are the hearts of men and the revolutions of kingdoms.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p34"></A>99. In Two ways God restrains the fury of tyrants; either by raising up from among their own subjects open avengers, who rid the people of their tyranny, or by employing for that purpose the rage of men whose thoughts and contrivances are totally different, thus overturning one tyranny by means of another.</p>  		  
<p class="Body"><a name="v.iv-p35"></A>100. The obedience enjoined on subjects does not prevent the interference of any popular Magistrates whose office it is to restrain tyrants and to protect the liberty of the people. Our obedience to Magistrates ought to be such, that the obedience which we owe to the King of kings shall remain entire and unimpaired.</p>
