<p class="introHead"><a name="iv.i.xiii-p1"></A>GOD DISTINGUISHED FROM IDOLS, THAT HE MAY BE THE EXCLUSIVE OBJECT OF WORSHIP.</p>  			 
<p class="introHead"><a name="iv.i.xiii-p2"></A><i>Sections.</i></p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.i.xiii-p3"></A>1. Scripture, in teaching that there is but one God, does not make a dispute about words, but attributes all honour and religious worship to him alone. This proved, 1st, By the etymology of the term. 2d, By the testimony of God himself, when he declares that he is a jealous God, and will not allow himself to be confounded with any fictitious Deity.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.i.xiii-p4"></A>2. The Papists in opposing this pure doctrine, gain nothing by their distinction of &#948;&#965;&#955;&#953;&#945; and &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#945;.</p>  			 
<p class="intro"><a name="iv.i.xiii-p5"></A>3. Passages of Scripture subversive of the Papistical distinction, and proving that religious worship is due to God alone. Perversions of Divine worship.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.i.xiii-p6"></A>1. We said at the commencement of our work (chap. 2), that the knowledge of God consists not in frigid speculation, but carries worship along with it; and we touched by the way (chap. 5 s. 6, 9, 10) on what will be more copiously treated in other places (Book 2, chap. 8)&#8212;viz. how God is duly worshipped. Now I only briefly repeat, that whenever Scripture asserts the unity of God, it does not contend for a mere name, but also enjoins that nothing which belongs to 				Divinity be applied to any other; thus making it obvious in what respect pure religion differs from superstition. The Greek word &#949;&#965;&#787;&#963;&#949;&#769;&#946;&#949;&#953;&#945; means &#8220;right worship;&#8221; for the Greeks, though groping in darkness, were always aware that a certain rule was to be observed, in order that God might not be worshipped absurdly. Cicero truly and shrewdly derives the name <i>religion</i> from <i>relego</i>, and yet the reason which he assigns is forced and farfetched&#8212;viz. that honest worshipers <i>read</i> 				and <i>read again</i>, and ponder what is true.9 				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">87</FONT></A>
 				I rather think the name is used in opposition to <i>vagrant license</i>&#8212;the greater part of mankind rashly taking up whatever first comes in their way, whereas piety, that it may stand with a firm step, confines itself within due bounds. In the same way superstition seems to take its name from its not being contented with the measure which reason prescribes, but accumulating a superfluous mass of vanities. But to say nothing more of words, it has been universally admitted in all 				ages, that religion is vitiated and perverted whenever false opinions are introduced into it, and hence it is inferred, that whatever is allowed to be done from inconsiderate zeal, cannot be defended by any pretext with which the superstitious may choose to cloak it. But although this confession is in every man&#8217;s mouth, a shameful stupidity is forthwith manifested, inasmuch as men neither cleave to the one God, nor use any selection in their worship, as we have already observed.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.i.xiii-p8"></A>But God, in vindicating his own right, first proclaims that he is a jealous God, and will be a stern avenger if he is confounded with any false god; and thereafter defines what due worship is, in order that the human race may be kept in obedience. Both of these he embraces in his Law when he first binds the faithful in allegiance to him as their only Lawgiver, and then prescribes a rule for worshipping him in accordance with his will. The Law, with its manifold uses 				and objects, I will consider in its own place; at present I only advert to this one, that it is designed as a bridle to curb men, and prevent them from turning aside to spurious worship. But it is necessary to attend to the observation with which I set out&#8212;viz. that unless everything peculiar to divinity is confined to God alone, he is robbed of his honour, and his worship is violated.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.i.xiii-p9"></A>It may be proper here more particularly to attend to the subtleties which superstition employs. In revolting to strange gods, it avoids the appearance of abandoning the Supreme God, or reducing him to the same rank with others. It gives him the highest place, but at the same time surrounds him with a tribe of minor deities, among whom it portions out his peculiar offices. In this way, though in a dissembling and crafty manner, the glory of the Godhead is dissected, and 				not allowed to remain entire. In the same way the people of old, both Jews and Gentiles, placed an immense crowd in subordination to the father and ruler of the gods, and gave them, according to their rank, to share with the supreme God in the government of heaven and earth. In the same way, too, for some ages past, departed saints have been exalted to partnership with God, to be worshipped, invoked, and lauded in his stead. And yet we do not even think that the majesty of God is obscured by 				this abomination, whereas it is in a great measure suppressed and extinguished&#8212;all that we retain being a frigid opinion of his supreme power. At the same time, being deluded by these entanglements, we go astray after divers gods.</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.i.xiii-p10"></A>2. The distinction of what is called &#948;&#965;&#955;&#953;&#945; and &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#945; was invented for the very purpose of permitting divine honours to be paid to angels and dead men with apparent impunity. For it is plain that the worship which Papists pay to saints differs in no respect from the worship of God: for this worship is paid without distinction; only when they are pressed they have recourse to the evasion, that what belongs to God is kept unimpaired, because they leave him &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#945;. But 				since the question relates not to the word, but the thing, how can they be allowed to sport at will with a matter of the highest moment? But not to insist on this, the utmost they will obtain by their distinction is, that they give worship to God, and service to the others. For &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#768;&#945; in Greek has the same meaning as <i>worship</i> in Latin; whereas &#948;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#768;&#945; properly means service, though the words are sometimes used in Scripture indiscriminately. But granting that the distinction is 				invariably preserved, the thing to be inquired into is the meaning of each. &#916;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#768;&#945; unquestionably means service, and &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#768;&#945; worship. But no man doubts that to <i>serve</i> is something higher than to <i>worship</i>. For it were often a hard thing to serve him whom you would not refuse to reverence. It is, therefore, an unjust division to assign the greater to the saints and leave the less to God. But several of the ancient fathers observed this distinction. What if they did, when all men 				see that it is not only improper, but utterly frivolous?</p>  			 
<p class="Body"><a name="iv.i.xiii-p11"></A>3. Laying aside subtleties, let us examine the thing. When Paul reminds the Galatians of what they were before they came to the knowledge of Gods he says that they &#8220;did service unto them which by nature are no gods,&#8221; (<a name="iv.i.xiii-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008">Gal. 4:8</a><a name="iv.i.xiii-p11.1"></A>). Because he does not say &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#945;, was their superstition excusable? This superstition, to which he gives the name of &#948;&#965;&#955;&#953;&#945;, he condemns as much as if he had given it the name of &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#945;. When Christ repels Satan&#8217;s insulting proposal with the 				words, &#8220;It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve,&#8221; (<a name="iv.i.xiii-p11.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#010">Mt. 4:10</a><a name="iv.i.xiii-p11.2"></A>), there was no question of &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#945;. For all that Satan asked was &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#965;&#768;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; (obeisance). In like manners when John is rebuked by the angel for falling on his knees before him (<a name="iv.i.xiii-p11.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010">Rev. 19:10</a><a name="iv.i.xiii-p11.3"></A>; 22:8, 9), we ought not to suppose that John had so far forgotten himself as to have intended to transfer the honour due to God alone to an angel. But because it was impossible that a worship connected with 				religion should not savour somewhat of divine worship, he could not &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#965;&#768;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#785;&#957; (do obeisance to) the angel without derogating from the glory of God. True, we often read that men were worshipped; but that was, if I may so speak, civil honour. The case is different with religious honour, which, the moment it is conjoined with worship, carries profanation of the divine honour along with it. The same thing may be seen in the case of Cornelius (<a name="iv.i.xiii-p11.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#025">Acts 10:25</a><a name="iv.i.xiii-p11.4"></A>). He had not made so little progress in 				piety as not to confine supreme worship to God alone. Therefore, when he prostrates himself before Peter, he certainly does it not with the intention of adoring him instead of God. Yet Peter sternly forbids him. And why, but just because men never distinguish so accurately between the worship of God and the creatures as not to transfer promiscuously to the creature that which belongs only to God. Therefore, if we would have one God, let us remember that we can never appropriate the minutest 				portion of his glory without retaining what is his due. Accordingly, when Zechariah discourses concerning the repairing of the Church, he distinctly says not only that there would be one God, but also that he would have only one name&#8212;the reason being, that he might have nothing in common with idols. The nature of the worship which God requires will be seen in its own place (Book 2, c. 7 and 8). He has been pleased to prescribe in his Law what is lawful and right, and thus restrict men to a 				certain rule, lest any should allow themselves to devise a worship of their own. But as it is inexpedient to burden the reader by mixing up a variety of topics, I do not now dwell on this one. Let it suffice to remember, that whatever offices of piety are bestowed anywhere else than on God alone, are of the nature of sacrilege. First, superstition attached divine honours to the sun and stars, or to idols: afterwards ambition followed&#8212;ambition which, decking man in the spoils of God, dared to 				profane all that was sacred. And though the principle of worshipping a supreme Deity continued to be held, still the practice was to sacrifice promiscuously to genii and minor gods, or departed heroes: so prone is the descent to this vice of communicating to a crowd that which God strictly claims as his own peculiar right!</p>
