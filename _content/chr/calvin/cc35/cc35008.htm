<p><a name="ix.i-p2"></A><b>1.</b> Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. <b>2.</b> And the soldiers, platting a crown of thorns, put it on his head, and put on him a purple robe, <b>3.</b> And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and struck him with the palms of their hands. <b>4.</b> Pilate therefore went out again, and said to them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no guilt in him.<b> 5.</b> Jesus then went out, wearing the crown of 				  thorns and the purple robe.

<p><a name="ix.i-p6"></A><b>1.</b> <i>Then Pilate therefore took Jesus.</i> Pilate adheres to his original intention; but to the former ignominy he adds a second, hoping that, when Christ shall have been scourged, the Jews will be satisfied with this light chastisement. When he labors so earnestly, and without any success, we 			 ought to recognize in this the decree of Heaven, by which Christ was appointed to death. Yet his innocence is frequently attested by the testimony of the judge, in order to assure us that he was free from all sin, and that he was substituted as a guilty person in the room of others, and bore the punishment due to the sins of others. We see also in Pilate a remarkable example of a trembling conscience. He acquits Christ with his mouth, and acknowledges that <i>there is no 			 guilt in him, </i>and yet inflicts punishment on him, as if he were guilty. Thus, they who have not so much courage as to defend, with unshaken constancy, what is right, must be driven hither and thither, and led to adopt opposite and conflicting opinions.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p7"></A>We all condemn <i>Pilate; </i>and yet, it is shameful to relate that there are so many <i>Pilates</i>  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_156"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">157</FONT></A>
 			  in the world, who <i>scourge Christ, </i>not only in his members, but also in his doctrine. There are many who, for the purpose of saving the life of those who are persecuted for the sake of the Gospel, constrain them wickedly to deny Christ. What is this, but to expose Christ to ridicule, that he may lead a dishonorable life? Others select and approve of certain parts of the Gospel, and yet tear the whole Gospel to pieces. They think that they have done exceedingly well, if 			 they have corrected a few gross abuses. It would be better that the doctrine should be buried for a time, than that it should be <i>scourged </i>in this manner, for it would spring up again ill spite of the devil and of tyrants; but nothing is more difficult than to restore it to its purity after having been once corrupted.</p>

<p><a name="ix.i-p10"></A><b>2.</b> <i>And the soldiers, platting a crown of thorns.</i> This was unquestionably done by the authority of Pilate, in order to affix a mark of infamy on the Son of God, for having <i>made himself a king; </i>and that in order to satisfy the rage of the 			 Jews, as if he had been convinced that the accusations which they brought against Christ were well founded. Yet the wickedness and insolence of the soldiers is indulged more freely than had been ordered by the judge; as ungodly men eagerly seize on the opportunity of doing evil whenever it is offered to them. But we see here the amazing cruelty of the Jewish nation,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_157"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">158</FONT></A>
 			  whose minds are not moved to compassion by so piteous a spectacle; but all this is directed by God, in order to reconcile the world to himself by the death of his Son.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.i-p12"></A><a name="ix.i-p12.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p13"></A><b>6.</b> <i>Take you him.</i> He did not wish to deliver Christ into their hands, or to abandon him to their fury; only he declares that he will not be their executioner. This is evident from the reason immediately added, when he says that <i>he finds no 			 guilt in him; </i>as if he had said, that he will never be persuaded to shed innocent blood for their gratification. That it is only the priests and officers who demand that he shall be crucified, is evident from the circumstance that the madness of the people was not so great, except so far as those bellows contributed afterwards to kindle it.</p>  <a name="ix.ii"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption12"><a name="ix.ii-p1"></A><a name="ix.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#007">John 19:7-11</a><a name="ix.ii-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ix.ii-p2"></A><b>7.</b> The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. <b>8.</b> When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was the more afraid; <b>9.</b> And went again into the hall, and said to Jesus, Whence art thou? And Jesus gave him no answer. <b>10.</b> Then Pilate said to him, Speakest thou not to me? Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release 				  thee? <b>11.</b> Jesus answered, Thou wouldest have no power against me, unless it were given to thee from above; therefore he who hath delivered me to thee hath the greater sin.</p> 				  			   		    		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p3"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ii-p4"></A><a name="ix.ii-p4.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p5"></A><b>7.</b> <i>We have a law.</i> They mean that, in proceeding against Christ, they do what is right, and are not actuated by hatred or sinful passion; for they perceived that Pilate had indirectly reproved them. Now, they speak as in the presence of a man who was ignorant of <i>the 			 law; </i>as if they had said, &#8220;We are permitted to live after our own manner, and our religion does not suffer any man to boast of being <i>the Son of God.</i>&#8221; Besides, this accusation was not altogether void of plausibility, but they erred grievously in the application of it. The general doctrine was undoubtedly true, that it was 			 not lawful for men to assume any honor which is due to God, and that they who claimed for themselves what is peculiar to God alone <i>deserved to be put to death. </i>But the source of their error related to the person of Christ, because they did not consider what are the titles given by Scripture to the Messiah, from which they might easily have learned that he was the <i>Son of God, </i>and did not even 			 deign to inquire whether or not Jesus was the Messiah whom God had formerly promised.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p6"></A>We see, then, how they drew a false conclusion from a true principle, for they reason badly. This example warns us to distinguish carefully between a general doctrine and the application of it,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">159</FONT></A>
 			 for there are many ignorant and unsteady persons who reject the very principles of Scripture, if they have once been deceived by the semblance of truth; and such licentiousness makes too great progress in the world every day. Let us, therefore, remember that we ought to guard against imposition, so that principles which are true may remain in all their force, and that the authority of Scripture may not be diminished.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p8"></A>On the other hand, we may easily find a reply to wicked men, who falsely and improperly allege the testimony of Scripture, and the principles which they draw from it, to support their bad designs; just as the Papists, when they extol in lofty terms the authority of the Church, bring forward nothing about which all the children of God are not agreed. They maintain that the Church is the mother of believers, that she is the pillar of truth, that 			 she ought to be heard, that she is guided by the Holy Spirit.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">160</FONT></A>
 			 All this we ought to admit, but when they wish to appropriate to themselves all the authority that is due to the Church, they wickedly, and with sacrilegious presumption, seize what does not at all belong to them. For we must inquire into the grounds of what they assume as true, that they deserve the title of The Church; and here they utterly fail. In like manner, when they exercise furious cruelty against all the godly, they do so on this pretence, that they have been ordained to 			 defend the faith and peace of the Church. But when we examine the matter more closely, we plainly see that there is nothing which they have less at heart than the defense of true doctrine, that nothing affects them less than a care about peace and harmony, but that they only fight to uphold their own tyranny. They who are satisfied with general principles, and do not attend to the <i>circumstances, </i>imagine that the Papists do right in attacking us; but the investigation of the matter 			 quickly dissipates that smoke by which they deceive the simple.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">161</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ii-p12"></A><a name="ix.ii-p12.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p13"></A><b>8.</b> <i>He was the more afraid.</i> These words may be explained in two ways. The first is, that Pilate dreaded lest some blame should be imputed to him, if a tumult arose, because he had not condemned Christ. The second is, that, after having heard the name of <i>the Son of 			 God, </i>his mind was moved by religion. This second view is confirmed by what immediately follows:</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ii-p14"></A><a name="ix.ii-p14.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p15"></A><b>9.</b> <i>And he entered again into the hall, and said to Jesus; Whence Art Thou?</i> It is evident from this that he was in a state of perplexity and anguish, because <i>he was afraid </i>that he would be punished for sacrilege, if he laid his hand on <i>the Son of God</i> It ought to be observed that, when he asks <i>whence Christ is, </i>he does not inquire about his country, but the meaning is, as if he had said, &#8220;Art thou a man born on the earth, or art thou some god?&#8221; The interpretation which I give to this 			 passage, therefore, is, that Pilate, struck with the fear of God, was in perplexity and doubt as to what he ought to do;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">162</FONT></A>
 			  for he saw, on the one hand, the excitement of a mutiny, and, on the other hand, conscience held him bound not to offend God for the sake of avoiding danger.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p17"></A>This example is highly worthy of observation. Though the countenance of Christ was so disfigured, yet, as soon as Pilate hears the name of God, he is seized with the <i>fear </i>of violating the majesty of God in a man who was utterly mean and despicable. If reverence for God had so much influence on an irreligious man, must not they be worse than reprobate, who now judge of divine things in sport and jest, carelessly, and without any <i>fear? 			 </i>for, indeed, Pilate is a proof that men have naturally a sentiment of religion, which does not suffer them to rush fearlessly in any direction they choose, when the question relates to divine things. This is the reason why I said that those who, in handling the doctrine of Scripture, are not more impressed with the majesty of God, than if they had been disputing about the shadow of an ass, <i>are given up to a reprobate mind, </i>(<a name="ix.ii-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028">Ro 1:28</a><a name="ix.ii-p17.1"></A>.) Yet they will one day feel to their destruction, what veneration is due to the name of God, which they now treat with such disdainful and outrageous mockery. It is shocking to relate how haughtily the Papists condemn the plain and ascertained truth of God, and with what cruelty they shed innocent blood. Whence, I beseech you, comes that drunken stupidity, but because they do not recollect that they have anything to do with God?</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p18"></A><i>And Jesus gave him no answer.</i> We ought not to think it strange that Jesus makes no reply; at least, if we keep in mind what I have formerly mentioned, that he did not stand before Pilate to plead his own cause, &#8212; as is customary with persons accused who are desirous to be acquitted, &#8212; but rather to suffer condemnation; for it was proper 			 that he should be condemned, when he appeared in our room. This is the reason why he makes no defense; and yet Christ&#8217;s silence is not inconsistent with what Paul says,</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.ii-p19"></A>Remember that Christ, before Pilate, made a good confession, <br> 			 (<a name="ix.ii-p19.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013">1Ti 6:13</a><a name="ix.ii-p19.2"></A>;)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p20"></A>for there he maintained the faith of the Gospel, as far as was necessary, and his death was nothing else than the sealing of the doctrine delivered by him. Christ left nothing undone of what was necessary to make a lawful confession, but he kept silence as to asking an acquittal. Besides, there was some danger that Pilate would acquit Christ as one of the pretended gods, as Tiberius wished to rank him among the gods of the Romans. Justly, 			 therefore, does Christ, by his silence, frown on this foolish superstition.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ii-p21"></A><a name="ix.ii-p21.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p22"></A><b>10.</b> <i>Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee?</i> This shows that the dread with which Pilate had been suddenly seized was transitory, and had no solid root; for now, forgetting all fear, he breaks out into haughty and monstrous contempt of God. He threatens Christ, as if there had 			 not been a Judge in heaven; but this must always happen with irreligious men, that, shaking off the fear of God, they quickly return to their natural disposition. Hence also we infer, that it is not without good reason that <i>the heart of man </i>is called <i>deceitful, </i>(<a name="ix.ii-p22.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009">Jer 17:9</a><a name="ix.ii-p22.1"></A>;) for, 			 though some fear of God dwells in it, there likewise comes from it mere impiety. Whoever, then, is not regenerated by the Spirit of God, though he pretend for a time to reverence the majesty of God, will quickly show, by opposite facts, that this fear was hypocritical.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p23"></A>Again, we see in Pilate an image of a proud man, who is driven to madness by his ambition; for, when he wishes to exalt his power, he deprives himself of all praise and reputation for justice. He acknowledges that Christ is innocent, and therefore he makes himself no better than a robber, when he boasts that he has power to cut his throat! Thus, wicked consciences, in which faith and the true knowledge of God do not reign, must necessarily be 			 agitated, and there must be within them various feelings of the flesh, which contend with each other; and in this manner God takes signal vengeance on the pride of men, when they go beyond their limits, so as to claim for themselves infinite power. By condemning themselves for injustice, they stamp on themselves the greatest reproach and disgrace. No blindness, therefore, is greater than that of pride; and we need not wonder, since pride feels the hand of God, against which it strikes, to be 			 armed with vengeance. Let us therefore remember, that we ought not rashly to indulge in foolish boastings, lest we expose ourselves to ridicule; and especially that those who occupy a high rank ought to conduct themselves modestly, and not to be ashamed of being subject to God and to his laws.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ii-p24"></A><a name="ix.ii-p24.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p25"></A><b>11.</b> <i>Thou wouldest have no power.</i> Some explain this in a general sense, that nothing is done in the world but by the permission of God; as if Christ had said, that Pilate, though he thinks that he can do all things, will do nothing more than God permits. The statement is, no doubt, true, 			 that this world is regulated by the disposal of God, and that, whatever may be the efforts of wicked men, still they cannot even move a finger but as the secret power of God directs. But I prefer the opinion of those who confine this passage to the office of the magistrate; for by these words Christ rebukes the foolish boasting of Pilate, in extolling himself, as if his power had not been from God; as if he had said, Thou claimest every thing for thyself&#8217;, as if thou hadst not to render an 			 account one day to God; but it was not without His providence that thou wast made a judge. Consider, then, that His heavenly throne is far higher than thy tribunal. It is impossible to find any admonition better fitted to repress the insolence of those who rule over others, that they may not abuse their authority. The father imagines that he may do what he pleases towards his children, the husband towards his wife, the master towards his servants, the prince towards his people, unless when they 			 look to God, who hath determined that their authority shall be limited by a fixed rule.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p26"></A><i>Therefore he who delivered me to thee.</i> Some think that this declares the Jews to be more guilty than Pilate, because, with wicked hatred and malicious treachery, they are enraged against an innocent man, that is, those of them who were private individuals, and not clothed with lawful authority. But I think that this circumstance renders 			 their guilt more heinous and less excusable on another ground, that they constrain a divinely appointed government to comply with their lawless desires; for it is a monstrous sacrilege to pervert a holy ordinance of God for promoting any wickedness. The robber, who, with his own hand, cuts the throat of a wretched passenger, is justly held in abhorrence; but he who, under the forms of a judicial trial, puts to death an innocent man, is much more wicked. Yet Christ does not aggravate their 			 guilt, for the purpose of extenuating that of Pilate; for he does not institute a comparison between him and them, but rather includes them all in the same condemnation, because they equally pollute a holy power. There is only this difference, that he makes direct attack on the Jews, but indirectly censures Pilate, who complies with their wicked desire.</p>  <a name="ix.iii"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption12"><a name="ix.iii-p1"></A><a name="ix.iii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#012">John 19:12-16</a><a name="ix.iii-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ix.iii-p2"></A><b>12.</b> From that time Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar's friend: whoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. <b>13.</b> When Pilate, therefore, had heard this saying, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat, in a place which is called the Stone-pavement, and in Hebrew, Gabbatha. <b>14.</b> And it was the preparation of the passover, about 				  the sixth hour; and he saith to the Jews, Behold your King!  				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">163</FONT></A>
 				  <b>15.</b> But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. <b>16.</b> Then, therefore, he delivered him to them to be crucified; and they took Jesus, and led him away.</p> 				  			   		    		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.iii-p5"></A><a name="ix.iii-p5.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p6"></A><b>12.</b> <i>From that time Pilate sought to release him.</i> Though <i>Pilate </i>does not conduct himself conscientiously, and is actuated more by ambition than by a regard to justice, and, on that account, is wretchedly irresolute, yet his modesty is 			 commendable on this ground, that, when he is severely reproved by Christ, he does not fly into a passion, but, on the contrary, is still more disposed to release him. He is a judge, and yet he meekly permits the accused person to be his reprover; and, indeed, scarcely one person in a hundred will be found, who so mildly suffers a reproof, even from one who is his equal.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p7"></A><i>Thou art not Caesar&#8217;s friend.</i> By threats they prevail on Pilate to condemn Christ; for they could do nothing that was more hateful, or more fitted to produce terror, than to hold him suspected of disloyalty to Caesar. &#8220;Thou showest,&#8221; say they, &#8220;that thou dost not care about Caesar&#8217;s authority, if thou acquit him who has endeavored to 			 throw every thing into confusion.&#8221; This wickedness at length broke down the resolution of Pilate, who, till now, had only been shaken by their furious clamours. Nor is it without a good reason that the Evangelist so laboriously examines and details those circumstances; for it is of great importance to us to know, that Pilate did not condemn Christ, before he had several times acquitted him with his own mouth, in order that we may learn from it, that it was for our sins that he was condemned, 			 and not on his own account. We may also learn from it, how voluntarily he offered himself to die, when he disdained to avail himself of the favorable disposition of the judge towards him; and, indeed, it was this obedience that caused his death to be <i>a sacrifice of sweet savour, </i>(<a name="ix.iii-p7.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002">Eph 5:2</a><a name="ix.iii-p7.1"></A>,) for blotting out all sins.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.iii-p8"></A><a name="ix.iii-p8.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p9"></A><b>13.</b> <i>And sat down on the judgment-seat.</i> Hence we see what conflicting opinions passed through the mind of Pilate, as if he had been a stage-player who was acting two characters. He ascends <i>the judgment-seat, </i>in order to pronounce sentence 			 of death on Christ solemnly, and in the customary form;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">164</FONT></A>
 			  and yet he declares openly, that he does so reluctantly and against his conscience. When he calls Christ <i>king, </i>he speaks ironically, meaning that it was a trivial charge which the Jews brought against him; or rather, for the purpose of allaying their fury, he warns them, that it would bring disgrace on the whole nation, if a report were spread abroad, that a person of that nation had been condemned to die for 			 aspiring to kingly power.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p11"></A><i>In the place which is called the Stone-pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</i> When the Evangelist says, that <a name="ix.iii-p11.1"></A>&#1490;&#1489;&#1514;&#1488; (<i>Gabbatha</i>) was 			 the name of the place <i>in </i>Hebrew he means the Chaldaic or Syriac language, which was then in common use; for in <i>Hebrew, </i><a name="ix.iii-p11.2"></A> &#1490;&#1489;&#1492;(<i>Gabach</i>) means <i>to be lofty. </i>It was proper, 			 therefore, that Christ should be condemned from <i>a lofty place, </i>that he, coming from heaven as the supreme Judge, may acquit us at the last day.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.iii-p12"></A><a name="ix.iii-p12.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p13"></A><b>14.</b> <i>About the sixth hour.</i> The Evangelists appear to differ, and even to contradict each other, in the computation of time. The other three Evangelists say that <i>the darkness </i>came on <i>about the sixth hour, 			 </i>while Christ was hanging on the cross, (<a name="ix.iii-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#045">Mt 27:45</a><a name="ix.iii-p13.1"></A>; <a name="ix.iii-p13.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#033">Mr 15:33</a><a name="ix.iii-p13.2"></A>; <a name="ix.iii-p13.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#044">Lu 23:44</a><a name="ix.iii-p13.3"></A>.) Mark, too says expressly that it was <i>the 			 third hour </i>when the sentence was pronounced on him, (<a name="ix.iii-p13.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#025">Mr 15:25</a><a name="ix.iii-p13.4"></A>.) But this may be easily explained. It is plain enough from other passages that the day was at that time divided into four parts, as the night also contained four watches; in consequence of which, the Evangelists sometimes allot not more than four hours to each day, and extend each hour to three, and, 			 at the same time, reckon the space of an hour, which was drawing to a close, as belonging to the next part. According to this calculation, <i>John </i>relates that Christ was condemned <i>about the sixth hour, </i>because the time of the day was drawing towards <i>the sixth hour, </i>or towards the second part of the day. Hence we infer that Christ was crucified at or 			 about <i>the sixth hour; </i>for, as the Evangelist afterwards mentions, (<a name="ix.iii-p13.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#020">Joh 19:20</a><a name="ix.iii-p13.5"></A>,) <i>the place was near to the city.

 			  for God did not surrender his Son to their lawless passions, but determined that, according to his own will and good pleasure, he should be offered as a sacrifice.

<p><a name="ix.iv-p21"></A><b>19.</b> <i>And Pilate wrote also a title.</i> The Evangelist relates a memorable action of Pilate, after having pronounced the sentence. It is perhaps true that it was customary to affix <i>titles, </i>when malefactors were executed, that the cause of the 			 punishment might be known to all, and might serve the purpose of an example. But in Christ there is this extraordinary circumstance, that the <i>title </i>which is affixed to him implies no disgrace; for Pilate&#8217;s intention was, to avenge himself indirectly on the Jews, (who, by their obstinacy, had extorted from him an unjust sentence of death on an innocent man,) and, in the person of Christ, to throw blame on the whole nation. Thus he does not brand 			 Christ with the commission of any crime.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p22"></A>But the providence of God, which guided the pen of Pilate, had a higher object in view. It did not, indeed, occur to Pilate to celebrate Christ as the Author of salvation, and the Nazarene of <i>God, </i>and the King of a chosen people; but God dictated to him this commendation of the Gospel, though he knew not the meaning of what he wrote. It. was the same secret guidance of the Spirit that caused <i>the title </i>to be published in three 			 languages; for it is not probable that this was an ordinary practice, but the Lord showed, by this preparatory arrangement, that the time was now at hand, when the name of his Son should be made known throughout the whole earth.</p>

But yet they do not conceal their deep hatred of the truth, since the smallest spark of it is more than they are able to endure. Thus Satan always prompts his servants to endeavor to extinguish, or, at least, to choke, by their own darkness, the light of God, as soon as the feeblest ray of it appears.</p>

Let us know, therefore, that he was held by a Divine hand, so that he remained unmoved. Pilate did 			 not yield to the prayers of the priests, and did not allow himself to be corrupted by them; but God testified, by his mouth, the firmness and stability of the kingdom of his Son. And if, in the writing of Pilate, the kingdom of Christ was shown to be so firm that it could not be shaken by all the attacks of its enemies, what value ought we to attach to the testimonies of the Prophets, whose tongues and hands God consecrated to his service?</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p27"></A>The example of <i>Pilate </i>reminds us, also, that it is our duty to remain steady in defending the truth.

How great, then, will be our dishonor, if, terrified by threatenigs or dangers, we withdraw from the profession of his doctrine, which God hath sealed on our hearts by his Spirit! Besides, it 			 ought to be observed how detestable is the tyranny of the Papists, which prohibits the reading of the Gospel, and of the whole of the Scripture, by the common people. Pilate, though he was a reprobate man, and, in other respects, an instrument of Satan, was nevertheless, by a secret guidance, appointed to be a herald of the Gospel, that he might publish a short summary of it in three languages.

There <i>were four </i>soldiers who <i>parted </i>among themselves all his <i>garments, 			 </i>except <i>the coat, </i>which, being <i>without seam </i>could not be divided, and therefore <i>they cast lots </i>on it. To fix our minds on the contemplation of the purpose of God, the Evangelists remind us that, in this occurrence also, there was a fulfillment of Scripture. It may be thought, however, that the passage, which they quote from 			 <a name="ix.v-p6.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#019">Ps 22:19</a><a name="ix.v-p6.4"></A>, is inappropriately applied to the subject in hand; for, though David complains in it that he was exposed as a prey to his enemies, he makes use of the word <i>garments </i>to denote metaphorically all his property; as if he had said, in a single word, that &#8220;he had been stripped naked and bare by wicked men;&#8221; and, when the Evangelists 			 disregard the figure, they depart from the natural meaning of the passage. But we ought to remember, in the first place, that the psalm ought not to be restricted to David, as is evident from many parts of it, and especially from a clause in which it is written, <i>I will proclaim thy name among the Gentiles, </i>(<a name="ix.v-p6.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022">Ps 22:22</a><a name="ix.v-p6.5"></A>) which must be explained as referring to Christ. We need not wonder, therefore, if that which was faintly shadowed out in David is beheld in Christ with all that superior clearness which the truth ought to have, as compared with the figurative representation of it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.v-p7"></A>Let us also learn that. Christ was stripped of his <i>garments, </i>that he might clothe us with righteousness; that his naked body was exposed to the insults of men, that we may appear in glory before the judgment-seat of God. As to the allegorical meaning to which some men have tortured this passage, by making it mean, that heretics tear Scripture in pieces, it is too far-fetched; though I would not object to such a comparison as this, &#8212;that, 			 as the <i>garments </i>of Christ were once divided by ungodly <i>soldiers, </i>so, in the present day, there are perverse men who, by foreign inventions, tear the whole of the Scripture, with which Christ is clothed, in order that he may be manifested to us. But the wickedness of the Papists, accompanied by shocking blasphemy against God, is intolerable. They tell us, that Scripture is torn to pieces by heretics, but that <i>the coat</i> &#8212; <i>that </i>is, the Church &#8212; remains entire; and thus 			 they endeavor to prove that, without paying any attention to the authority of Scripture, the unity of faith consists in the mere title of the Church; as if the unity of the Church were itself founded on any thing else than the authority of Scripture. When, therefore, they separate faith from Scripture, so that it may continue to be attached to the Church alone, by such a divorce they not only strip Christ of his <i>garments, </i>but tear in pieces his body by shocking sacrilege. And though we 			 should admit what they maintain, that <i>the coat without seam </i>is a figure of the Church, they will be very far from gaining their point: for it will still remain to be proved, that the Church is placed under their authority, of which they show no sign whatever.</p>  <a name="ix.vi"></A>

It often happens that, when God calls us to the performance of any thing, our parents, or wife, or children, draw us in a contrary direction, so that we cannot give equal satisfaction 			 to all. If we place men in the same rank with God, we judge amiss. We must, therefore, give the preference to the command, the worship, and the service of God; after which, as far as we are able, we must give to men what is their due.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.vi-p6"></A>And yet the commands of the first and second table of the Law never jar with each other, though at first sight they appear to do so; but we must begin with the worship of God, and afterwards assign to men an inferior place.

<p class="Center"><a name="ix.vi-p7"></A>He who loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me, <br> 			 (<a name="ix.vi-p7.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#041">Mt 10:41</a><a name="ix.vi-p7.2"></A>;)</p>

<p><a name="ix.vi-p10"></A>We ought, therefore, to devote ourselves to the interests of men, so as not in any degree to interfere with the worship and obedience which we owe to God. When we have obeyed God, it will then be the proper time to think about parents, and wife, and children; as Christ attends to <i>his mother, </i>but it is after that he is on the cross, to which he has been called by his Father&#8217;s decree.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.vi-p11"></A>Yet, if we attend to the time and place when these things happened, Christ&#8217;s affection for <i>his mother </i>was worthy of admiration. I say nothing about the severe tortures of his body; I say nothing about the reproaches which he suffered; but, though horrible blasphemies against God filled his mind with inconceivable grief, and though he sustained a dreadful contest with eternal death and with the devil, still, none of these things prevent 			 him from being anxious about <i>his mother. </i>We may also learn from this passage, what is the honor which God, by the Law, commands us to render to parents, (<a name="ix.vi-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012">Ex 20:12</a><a name="ix.vi-p11.1"></A>.) Christ appoints <i>the disciple </i>to be his substitute, and charges him to support and take care of <i>his mother; </i>and hence it follows, that the honor which is due to parents consists, not in cold ceremony,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">171</FONT></A>
 			 but in the discharge of all necessary duties.</p>

 			 It is true that, in following Christ to the cross, they displayed more than ordinary affection; but, if they had not been supported by faith they could never have been present at this exhibition. As to John himself, we infer that, though his faith was choked for a short time, it was not wholly extinguished. How shameful will it be, if the dread of the cross deters us from following Christ, when the glory of his resurrection is placed before our eyes, whereas the women beheld in it 			 nothing but disgrace and cursing!</p>

He now describes the last act, which was an event of the greatest importance.When John says that <i>a vessel was placed 			 there, </i>he speaks of it as a thing that was customary. There has been much controversy on this subject; but I agree with those who think (and, indeed, the custom is proved by histories) that it was a kind of beverage usually administered for the purpose of accelerating the death of wretched malefactors, when they had undergone sufficient torture   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">176</FONT></A>
 			  Now, it ought to be remarked, that Christ does not ask any thing to <i>drink </i>till <i>all things have been accomplished; </i>and thus he testified his infinite love towards us, and the inconceivable earnestness of his desire to promote our salvation. No words can fully express the bitterness of the sorrows which he endured; and yet he does not desire to be freed from them, till 			 the justice of God has been satisfied, and till he has made a perfect atonement.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">177</FONT></A>

<p><a name="ix.vii-p8"></A>But how does he say, that all things were accomplished, while the most important part still remained to be performed, that is, his death? Besides, does not his resurrection contribute to the <i>accomplishment </i>of our salvation? I answer, John includes those things which were immediately to follow. Christ had not yet died: and had not yet risen again; but he saw that nothing now remained to hinder him from going forward to death and 			 resurrection. In this manner he instructs us, by his own example, to render perfect obedience, that we may not think it hard to live according to his good pleasure, even though we must languish in the midst of the most excruciating pains.</p>

 			  Now this word, which Christ employs, well deserves our attention; for it shows that the whole accomplishment of our salvation, and all the parts of it, are contained in his death. We have already stated that his resurrection is not separated from his death, but Christ only intends to keep our faith fixed on himself alone, and not to allow it to turn aside in any direction whatever. The meaning, therefore, is, that every thing which contributes to the salvation of 			 men is to be found in Christ, and ought not to be sought anywhere else; or &#8212; which amounts to the same thing &#8212; that the perfection of salvation is contained in him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.vii-p21"></A>There is also an implied contrast; for Christ contrasts his death with the ancient sacrifices and with all the figures; as if he had said,&#8221; Of all that was practiced under the <i>Law, </i>there was nothing that had any power in itself to make atonement for sins, to appease the wrath of God, and to obtain justification; but now the true salvation is exhibited and manifested to the world.&#8221; On this doctrine depends the abolition of all the 			 ceremonies of the Law; for it would be absurd to follow shadows, since we have the body in Christ.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.vii-p22"></A>If we give our assent to this word which Christ pronounced, we ought to be satisfied with his death alone for salvation, and we are not at liberty to apply for assistance in any other quarter; for he who was sent by the Heavenly Father to obtain for us a full acquittal, and to accomplish our redemption, knew well what belonged to his office, and did not fail in what he knew to be demanded of him. It was chiefly for the purpose of giving peace 			 and tranquillity to our consciences that he pronounced this word, <i>It is finished. </i>Let us stop here, therefore, if we do not choose to be deprived of the salvation which he has procured for us.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_181"></A><A HREF="#fn_181"><FONT SIZE="1">182</FONT></A>

<p><a name="ix.vii-p24"></A>But the whole religion of Popery tends to lead men to contrive for themselves innumerable methods of seeking salvation; and hence we infer, that it is full to overflowing with abominable sacrileges. More especially, this word of Christ condemns the abomination of the Mass. All the sacrifices of the Law must have ceased, for the salvation of men has been completed by the one sacrifice of the death of Christ. What right, then, have the Papists, 			 or what plausible excuse can they assign for saying, that they are authorised to prepare a new sacrifice, to reconcile God to men? They reply that it is not a new sacrifice, but the very sacrifice which Christ offered. But this is easily refuted; for, in the first place, they have no command to offer it; and, secondly, Christ, having once accomplished, by a single oblation, all that was necessary to be done, declares, from the cross, that all <i>is finished. </i>They are worse than forgers, 			 therefore, for they wickedly corrupt and falsify the testament sealed by the precious blood of the Son of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.vii-p25"></A><i>He yielded up his breath.</i> All the Evangelists take great care to mention the death of Christ, and most properly; for we obtain from it our confident hope of life, and we likewise obtain from it a fearless triumph over death, because the Son of God has endured it in our room, and, in his contest with it, has been victorious. But we must 			 attend to the phraseology which John employs, and which teaches us, that all believers, who die with Christ, peacefully commit their souls to the guardianship of God, who is faithful, and will not suffer to perish what he hath undertaken to preserve. The children of God, as well as the reprobate, die; but there is this difference between them, that the reprobate give up the soul, without knowing where it goes, or what becomes of it;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">183</FONT></A>
 			  while the children of God commit it, as a precious trust, to the protection of God, who will faithfully guard it till the day of the resurrection. The word <i>breath </i>is manifestly used here to denote the immortal soul.</p>  <a name="ix.viii"></A>

<p><a name="ix.viii-p6"></A><b>31.</b> <i>For it was the preparation.</i> This narrative also tends to the edification of our faith; first, because it shows that what had been foretold in the Scriptures is fulfilled in the person of Christ; and, secondly, because it contains a mystery of no ordinary value. The Evangelist says, 			 that <i>the Jews besought </i>that the bodies <i>might be taken down </i>from the crosses. This had undoubtedly been enjoined by the Law of God; but the Jews, as is usually the case with hypocrites, direct their whole attention to small matters, and yet pass by the greatest crimes without any hesitation; for, in order to a strict observance of their Sabbath, they are careful to avoid outward pollution; and yet 			 they do not consider how shocking a crime it is to take away the life of an innocent man.

<p class="Center"><a name="ix.viii-p7"></A>they did not enter into the governor&#8217;s hall, that they might not be defiled, <br> 			 (<a name="ix.viii-p7.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028">Joh 18:28</a><a name="ix.viii-p7.2"></A>,)</p>

 			  Another reading more generally approved is, <i>and that Sabbath-day was great</i>; but the reading which I have adopted is supported by many manuscripts that are ancient and of great authority. Let the reader choose for himself. If we read <a name="ix.viii-p10.4"></A>&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#957;&#959;&#965; in the genitive case, (<a name="ix.viii-p10.5"></A>&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#957;&#959;&#965; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#963;&#945;&#946;&#946;&#8049;&#964;&#959;&#965; of that Sabbath) the word Sabbath must be understood to denote the week; as if the Evangelist had said, that the festival of that week was very solemn, on account of the Passover. Note, the Evangelist speaks of the following day, which began at sunset. But, if we choose rather to read <a name="ix.viii-p10.6"></A>&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#957;&#951;, in the nominative case, <a name="ix.viii-p10.7"></A>&#7974;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#956;&#949;&#947;&#8049;&#955;&#951; &#7969; &#7969;&#956;&#8051;&#961;&#945; &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#957;&#951; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#963;&#945;&#946;&#946;&#8049;&#964;&#959;&#965;, and <i>That was the great day of the Sabbath</i>, the meaning will be nearly the same in substance; only there would be this difference in the words, that the Passover, which was to take place on the following day, would render that 			 Sabbath more solemn.</p>

<p><a name="ix.viii-p12"></A><b>33. </b><i>But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead.</i> That they break the legs of the two robbers, and after having done so, find that Christ is already dead, and therefore do not touch his body, appears to be a very extraordinary work of the providence of God. Ungodly men will, no doubt, say that it happens naturally 			 that one man dies sooner than another; but, if we examine carefully the whole course of the narrative, we shall be constrained to ascribe it to the secret purpose of God, that the death of Christ was brought on much more rapidly than men could have at all expected, and that this prevented his legs from being broken.</p>

It was a childish 			 contrivance of the Papists, when, out of the Greek word <a name="ix.viii-p14.1"></A>&#955;&#8057;&#947;&#967;&#949;, which means a spear,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">186</FONT></A>
 			  they manufactured the proper name of a man, and called this soldier Longinus, and, to give an air of plausibility to their story, foolishly alleged that he had been formerly blind, and that, after having received his sight, he was converted to the faith. Thus they have placed him in the catalogue of the saints.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">187</FONT></A>
 			  Since their prayers, whenever they call on God, rest on such intercessors, what, I ask, will they ever be able to obtain? But they who despise Christ, and seek the intercessions of the dead, deserve that the devil should drive them to ghosts and phantoms.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.viii-p18"></A><i>And immediately there came out blood and water.</i> Some men have deceived themselves by imagining that this was a miracle; for it is natural that the blood, when it is congealed, should lose its red color, and come to resemble water. It is well known also that water is contained in the membrane which immediately adjoins the intestines. What has led them astray 			 is, that the Evangelist takes so much pains to explain that blood flowed along with the water, as if he were relating something unusual and contrary to the order of nature. But he had quite a different intention; namely, to accommodate his narrative to the passages of Scripture which he immediately subjoins, and more especially that believers might infer from it what he states elsewhere, that Christ came with water and blood, (<a name="ix.viii-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006">1Jo 5:6</a><a name="ix.viii-p18.1"></A>.) By these words he means that Christ brought the true atonement and the true washing; for, on the one hand, forgiveness of sins and justification, and, on the other hand, the sanctification of the soul, were prefigured in the Law by those two symbols, sacrifices and washings. In sacrifices, blood atoned for sins, and was the ransom for appeasing the wrath of God. Washings were the tokens of true holiness, and the remedies for taking 			 away uncleanness and removing the pollutions of the flesh.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.viii-p19"></A>That faith may no longer rest on these elements, John declares that the fulfillment of both of these graces is in Christ; and here he presents to us a visible token of the same fact. The sacraments which Christ has left to his Church have the same design; for the purification and sanctification of the soul, which consists in newness of life, (<a name="ix.viii-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004">Ro 6:4</a><a name="ix.viii-p19.1"></A>,) is 			 pointed out to us in Baptism, and the Lord&#8217;s Supper is the pledge of a perfect atonement. But they differ widely from the ancient figures of the Law; for they exhibit Christ as being present, whereas the figures of the Law pointed out that he was still at a distance. For this reason I do not object to what Augustine says, that our sacraments have flowed from Christ&#8217;s side; for, when Baptism and the Lord&#8217;s Supper lead us to Christ&#8217;s side, that by faith we may draw from it, as from a fbuntain, 			 what they represent, then are we truly washed from our pollutions, and renewed to a holy life, and then do we truly live before God, redeemed from death, and delivered from condemnation.</p>

Note, Moses takes for granted that that lamb was a figure of the true and only sacrifice, by which the Church was to be redeemed. Nor is this inconsistent with the fact, that it was sacrificed as the memorial of a redemption which had been already made; for, while God intended that it should celebrate the former favor, he also intended that it should exhibit the spiritual deliverance of the Church, which was still future. On that account Paul, without any hesitation, 			 applies to Christ the rule which Moses lays down about eating the lamb:</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.viii-p22"></A>for even Christ, our Passover, is sacred for us.

<p><a name="ix.viii-p23"></A>From this analogy, or resemblance, faith derives no ordinary advantage, for, in all the ceremonies of the Law, it beholds the salvation which has been manifested in Christ.

Thus also 			 the Jews are reminded that they ought to seek in Christ the substance of all those things which the Law prefigured, but did not actually accomplish.</p>

 			 Does God promise to the Jews repentance to salvation, or, does he threaten that he will come as an avenger?

Matthew (<a name="ix.ix-p5.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#057">Mt 27:57</a><a name="ix.ix-p5.1"></A>) says, that he was <i>a rich man, </i>and Luke (<a name="ix.ix-p5.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#050">Lu 23:50</a><a name="ix.ix-p5.2"></A>) says, that he was <i>a counsellor; </i>that is, he held the rank of a senator. As to <i>Nicodemus, </i>we have seen, in the Third Chapter of this Gospel, that he held an honorable rank among his own countrymen; and that he was also <i>rich, </i>may be easily inferred from the great expense which he laid out in procuring this <i>mixture.</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ix-p6"></A>Till now, therefore, <i>riches </i>had prevented them from professing to be the disciples of Christ, and might afterwards have no less influence in keeping them from making a profession so much hated and abhorred. The Evangelist expressly says, that <i>Joseph </i>has formerly been kept back by this <i>fear </i>from venturing to declare openly that he was <i>a disciple </i>of Christ; and as to <i>Nicodemus, </i>he repeats what we have already 			 seen, that he came to Jesus secretly, and <i>by night, </i>(<a name="ix.ix-p6.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002">Joh 3:2</a><a name="ix.ix-p6.1"></A> and <a name="ix.ix-p6.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#050">Joh 7:50</a><a name="ix.ix-p6.2"></A>.) Whence, therefore, do they derive such heroic magnanimity that, when affairs are at the lowest ebb, they fearlessly come forth to public view? I say nothing of the great and evident danger which they must have incurred; but the most important point is, 			 that they did not scruple to place themselves in a state of perpetual warfare with their own nation. It is therefore certain that this was effected by a heavenly impulse, so that they who, <i>through, fear, </i>did not render the honor due to him while he was alive, now run to his dead body, as if they had become new men.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ix-p7"></A>They bring their spices to embalm the body of Christ; but they would never have done so, if they had been perfumed with the sweet sayour of his death. This shows the truth of what Christ had said,</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.ix-p8"></A>Unless a grain of corn die, it remaineth alone; <br> 			 but when it is dead, it bringeth forth much fruit, <br> 			 (<a name="ix.ix-p8.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024">Joh 12:24</a><a name="ix.ix-p8.3"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ix-p9"></A>For here we have a striking proof that his death was more quickening than his life; and so great was the efficacy of that sweet sayour which the death of Christ conveyed to the minds of those two men, that it quickly extinguished all the passions belonging to the flesh. So long as ambition and the love of money reigned in thenb the grace of Christ had no charms for them; but now they begin to disrelish the whole world.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ix-p10"></A>Besides, let us learn that their example points out to us what we owe to Christ. Those two men, as a testimony of their faith, not only took down Christ from the cross with great hazard, but boldly carried him to the grave. Our slothfulness will be base and shameful if, now that he reigns in the heavenly glory, we withhold from him the confession of our faith. So much the less excusable is the wickedness of those who, though they now deny 			 Christ by base hypocrisy, plead in his behalf the example of Nicodemus. In one thing, I admit, they resemble him, that they endeavor, as far as lies in their power, to bury Christ; but the time for burying is past, since he hath ascended to the right hand of the Father, that he may reign gloriously over angels and men, and that every tongue may proclaim his dominion, (<a name="ix.ix-p10.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009">Phil. 2:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010">10</a><a name="ix.ix-p10.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ix-p11"></A><i>Secretly, through fear of the Jews.</i> As this fear is contrasted with the holy boldness which the Spirit of the Lord wrought in the heart of <i>Joseph, </i>there is reason to believe that it was not free from blame. Not that all fear, by which believers guard against tyrants and enemies of the 			 Church, is faulty, but because the weakness of faith is manifested, whenever the confession of faith is withheld <i>through fear. </i>We ought always to consider what the Lord commands, and how far he bids us advance. He who stops in the middle of the course shows that he does not trust in God, and he who sets a higher value on his own life than on the command of God is without excuse.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ix-p12"></A><i>Who was a disciple of Jesus.</i> When we perceive that the Evangelist bestows on <i>Joseph </i>the honorable designation of <i>a disciple, </i>at a time when he was excessively timid, and did not venture to profess his faith before the world, we learn from 			 it how graciously God acts towards his people, and with what fatherly kindness he forgives their offenses. And yet the false <i>Nicodemites </i>have no right to flatter themselves, who not only keep their faith concealed within their own breast, but, by pretending to give their consent to wicked superstitions, do all that is in their power to deny that they are <i>disciples </i>of Christ.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ix-p13"></A><a name="ix.ix-p13.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ix-p14"></A><b>40. </b><i>As the custom of the Jews is to bury.</i> When Christ had endured extreme ignominy on the cross, God determined that his burial should be honourable, that it might serve as a preparation for the glory of his resurrection. The money expended on it by <i>Nicodemus </i>and 			 <i>Joseph </i>is very great, and may be thought by some to be superfluous; but we ought to consider the design of God, who even led them, by his Spirit, to render this honor to his own Son, that, by the sweet savor of his grave he might take away our dread of the cross. But those things which are cut of the ordinary course ought not to be regarded as an example.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ix-p15"></A>Besides, the Evangelist expressly states that he was buried according to <i>the custom of the Jews. </i>By these words he informs us that this was one of the ceremonies of the Law; for the ancient people, who did not receive so clear a statement of the resurrection, and who had not such a demonstration and pledge of it as we have in Christ, needed such aids to support them, that they might firmly believe and expect the coming of the Mediator  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_189"></A><A HREF="#fn_189"><FONT SIZE="1">190</FONT></A>
 			 We ought, therefore, to attend to the distinction between us, who have been enlightened by the brightness of the Gospel, and the rather, to whom the figures supplied the absence of Christ. This is the reason why allowance could then be made for a greater pomp of ceremonies, which, at the present <i>day, </i>would not be free from blame; for those who now bury the dead at so great an expense do not, strictly speaking, bury dead men, but rather, as far as lies in their power, draw down 			 from heaven Christ himself, the King of life, and lay him in the tomb, for his glorious resurrection  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">191</FONT></A>
 			 abolished those ancient ceremonies.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ix-p18"></A>Among the heathen, too, there was great anxiety and ceremony in burying the dead, which unquestionably derived its origin from the ancient Fathers of the Jews,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">192</FONT></A>
 			 in the same manner as sacrifices; but, as no hope of the resurrection existed along them, they were not imitators of the Fathers, but apes of them; for the promise and word of God is, as it were, the soul, which gives life to ceremonies. Take away the word, and all the ceremonies which men observe, though outwardly they may resemble the worship of godly persons, is nothing else than foolish or mad superstition. For our part, as we have said, we ought now to maintain sobriety and 			 moderation in this matter, for immoderate expense quenches the sweet savour of Christ&#8217;s resurrection.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ix-p20"></A><a name="ix.ix-p20.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ix-p21"></A><b>41. </b><i>Now, in the place where he was crucified there was a garden.</i> This is the <i>third </i>point, as I have said, which ought to be observed in the history of the burial. It is related by the Evangelist for various reasons. In the first place, it did not happen by 			 accident, but by an undoubted providence of God, that the body of Christ was buried <i>in a new sepulchre; </i>for although he died as all other men die, still, as he was to be <i>the first-born from the dead, </i>(<a name="ix.ix-p21.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018">Col 1:18</a><a name="ix.ix-p21.1"></A>,) and <i>the first-fruits of them that rise, 			 </i>(<a name="ix.ix-p21.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020">1Co 15:20</a><a name="ix.ix-p21.2"></A>) he had a <i>new sepulcher, in which no person had ever been laid</i> True, <i>Nicodemus </i>and <i>Joseph </i>had a different object in 			 view; for, in consequence of the short time that now remained till sunset, which was the commencement of the Sabbath, they looked to the convenience of the place, but, contrary to their intention God provided for his own Son <i>a sepulchre </i>which had not yet been used. The good men are merely gratified by <i>the place being near at hand, </i>that they might not violate the Sabbath; but God offers them what 			 they did not seek, that the burial of his Son might have some token to distinguish him from the rank of other men. The local situation served also to prove the truth of his resurrection, and to throw no small light on the narrative which is contained in the following chapter.</p>

His own early training and habits, as a lawyer, naturally led him to throw the argument into this form, especially when it related to a criminal prosecution; for even in our own times indictments invariably take the form of a syllogism. He appears to have conceived the accusation against Christ to run thus: &#8220;Any mere man, declaring himself to be <i>the Son of God, </i>is guilty of blasphemy, and deserves to die. But Jesus of Nazareth, who is a mere man, 				  <i>hath made himself to be the Son of God. </i>Therefore, <i>according to our law, </i>Jesus <i>ought to die.&#8221; </i>The major proposition cannot, be questioned, being manifestly taken from the law of Moses. The minor proposmon consists of two parts. 1. Jesus is a mere man. 2. Jesus <i>hath made himself to be the Son of God. </i>The second part is true, but the first is false; and, consequently, the whole argument, plausible as it had seemed, falls to the ground. It ought to have been known and 				  acknowledged by the <i>Jews, </i>that the honorable rank of <i>the Son of God, </i>though it could not without blasphemy be claimed by a mere child of Adam, belonged of right to Jesus of Nazareth, of whom, even before his birth, the angel said to the Virgin Mary,</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.viii-p16"></A> Dr Bloomfield subjoins the following note to this verse: &#8212; &#8220;The epitaph of this soldier, (if genuine,) said to be found in the Church of St Mary, at Lyons, is as follows: &#8212; <a name="ix.viii-p16.1"></A><i>Qui Salvatoris latus Cruce Cuspfdefixit, </i>Lo,&#8217;Ginus <i>Mc jacet</i> &#8212;<i>&#8217; Here lies </i>Longinu&#8217;s, <i>who pierced the Savior&#8217;s side on the Cross with a spear.&#8217;&#8221; </i>As the learned annotator has thus 				  summarily adverted to this legendary tale, it is right that the reader should be briefly put in possession of the whole of it, as it has been collected by Moreri from Tillemont and other ecclesiastical writers, in his &#8220;Directory&#8221; under the head, <i>St Longin</i> &#8212; (<i>St </i>Longinns.) This <i>St Longinus </i>is twofold: &#8220;some saying, that he was <i>the soldier </i>that pierced our Lord&#8217;s side with a spear; and some, that he was <i>the centurion </i>who commanded the guard at the cross. The 				  legends report both these persons to have been converted to the Christian faith, to have suffered martyrdom, and to have been canonized.&#8221; Moreri, however, though an ecclesiastic of the Romish Church, was constrained to add, <i>The acts of both Longinuses are manifestly false; and the circumstances they allege mutually refute each other.&#8221;</i></p>  				
<p><a name="ix.viii-p17"></A>It would appear that the name <i>Longinus </i>has been formed from the Greek <a name="ix.viii-p17.1"></A>&#955;&#8057;&#947;&#967;&#951;<i>, spear: Longinus </i>being the Latin form of <a name="ix.viii-p17.2"></A>&#955;&#8057;&#947;&#967;&#953;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#962;<i>,</i> &#8212; 				  <i>spear-man. </i>Thus, <i>St Longinus </i>is found to be a similar saint to the <i>Sancta Veronica, </i>reported by Brydone. &#8220;The Greeks,&#8221; continues Moreri, celebrate the martyrdom of Longinus, <i>the centurion, </i>on the 16th of October, the Latins on the 15th of March, and the Copts on the 1st of November. The martyrdom 				  of Longinus, <i>the soldier, </i>is <i>not </i>acknowledged by the Greeks; but the Latins commemorate it on different days; some on the 15th of March, some on the 1st of September, others on the 22nd of November; or 11th of December.&#8221; We thus see how little this offspring of credulity and superstition merits the attention of the readers of the <i>Gospel.</i> &#8212; <i>Granville Penn&#8217;s Annotations.</i></p> 			 </P>
