<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text22"><a name="ii.lvi-p12"></A>As Mark is more full, and explains the circumstances very minutely, we shall follow the order of his narrative. And first he points out clearly the reason why Christ uses a harshness so unusual with him, when he exclaims that the Jews, on account of their perverse malice, do not deserve to be any longer endured. We know how gently he was wont to receive them, even when their requests were excessively importunate.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_485"></A><A HREF="#fn_485"><FONT SIZE="1">486</FONT></A>
 			 A father here entreats in behalf of an only son, the necessity is extremely urgent, and a modest and humble appeal is made to the compassion of Christ. Why then does he, contrary to his custom, break out suddenly into passion, and declare that they can be endured no longer? As the narrative of Matthew and Luke does not enable us to discover the reason of this great severity, some commentators have fallen into the mistake of supposing that this rebuke was directed either against the 			 disciples, or against the father of the afflicted child. But if we duly consider all the circumstances of the case, as they are related by Mark, there will be no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion, that the indignation of Christ was directed against the malice of the scribes, and that he did not intend to treat the ignorant and weak with such harshness.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lvi-p14"></A>During Christ&#8217;s absence, a <i>lunatic</i> child had been brought forward. The scribes, regarding this as a plausible occasion for giving annoyance, seized upon it eagerly, and entreated the disciples that, if they had any power, they would exercise it in curing the child. It is probable that the disciples made an 			 attempt, and that their efforts were unavailing; upon which the scribes raise the shout of victory, and not only ridicule the disciples, but break out against Christ, as if in their person his power had been baffled. It was an extraordinary display of outrageous impiety united with equally base ingratitude, maliciously to keep out of view so many miracles, from which they had learned the amazing power of Christ; for they manifestly endeavored to extinguish the light which was placed before 			 their eyes. With good reason, therefore, does Christ exclaim that they could no longer be endured, and pronounce them to be <i>an unbelieving and perverse nation; </i>for the numerous proofs which they had formerly beheld ought at least to have had the effect of preventing them from seeking occasion of disparagement.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_486"></A><A HREF="#fn_486"><FONT SIZE="1">487</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lvi-p16"></A><b><a name="ii.lvi-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#014">Mark 9:14</a><a name="ii.lvi-p16.1"></A>. </b><i>He saw a great multitude around them.</i> The disciples were, no doubt, held up to public gaze, as the enemies of the truth are wont, on occasions of triumph, to assemble a crowd about a trifle. The scribes had made such a noise about it, as to draw down on the disciples the ridicule of many persons. And 			 yet it appears that there were some who were not ill disposed; for, as soon as they see Jesus, they salute him; and even the insolence of the scribes is restrained by his presence, for, when they are asked what is the matter in dispute, they have not a word to say.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.lvi-p17"></A><a name="ii.lvi-p17.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lvi-p18"></A><b>17. </b><i>Master, I have brought to thee my son.</i> Matthew describes a different sort of disease from what is described by Mark, for he says that the man was <i>lunatic</i> <i> 			 </i>But both agree as to these two points, that he was <i>dumb</i>, and that at certain intervals he became furious. The term <i>lunatic</i> is applied to those who, about the waning of the <i>moon</i>, are seized with epilepsy, or afflicted with giddiness. I do not admit the fanciful notion of Chrysostom, that the word <i>lunatic</i> was invented by a trick of Satan, in order to throw disgrace on the good creatures of God; for we learn from undoubted experience, that the course of the moon affects the increase or decline 			 of these diseases.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_487"></A><A HREF="#fn_487"><FONT SIZE="1">488</FONT></A>
 			  And yet this does not prevent Satan from mixing up his attacks with natural means. I am of opinion, therefore, that the man was not naturally <i>deaf </i>and <i>dumb</i>, but that Satan had taken possession of his tongue and ears; and that, as the weakness of his brain and nerves made him liable to epilepsy, Satan availed himself of 			 this for aggravating the disease. The consequence was, that he was exposed to danger on every hand, and was thrown into violent convulsions, which left him lying on the ground, in a fainting state, and like a dead man.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text22"><a name="ii.lvi-p20"></A>Let us learn from this how many ways Satan has of injuring us, were it not that he is restrained by the hand of God. Our infirmities both of soul and body, which we feel to be innumerable, are so many darts with which Satan is supplied for wounding us. We are worse than stupid, if a condition so wretched does not, arouse us to prayer. But in this we see also an amazing display of the goodness of God, that, though we are liable to such a 			 variety of dangers,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_488"></A><A HREF="#fn_488"><FONT SIZE="1">489</FONT></A>
 			 he surrounds us with his protection; particularly if we consider with what eagerness our enemy is bent on our destruction. We ought also to call to remembrance the consoling truth, that Christ has come to bridle his rage, and that we are safe in the midst of so many dangers, because our diseases are effectually counteracted by heavenly medicine.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lvi-p22"></A>We must attend also to the circumstance of the time. The father replies, that his son had been subject to this grievous disease from his <i>infancy</i>. If Satan was permitted to exert his power, to such an extent, on a person of that tender age, what reason have not we to fear, who are continually exposing ourselves by our crimes to deadly strokes, who even supply our enemy with darts, and on whom he might justly be permitted to spend 			 his rage, if it were not kept under restraint by the astonishing goodness of God?</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.lvi-p23"></A><a name="ii.lvi-p23.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lvi-p24"></A><b><a name="ii.lvi-p24.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#017">Matthew 17:17</a><a name="ii.lvi-p24.2"></A>. </b><i>O unbelieving and rebellious nation.</i> Though Christ appears to direct his discourse to the father of the <i>lunatic</i>, yet there can be no doubt that he refers to the scribes, 			 as I have lately explained; for it is certain that the reproof is directed, not against ignorant and weak persons, but against those who, through inveterate malice, obstinately resist God. This is the reason why Christ declares that they are no longer worthy to be endured, and threatens that ere long he will separate from them. But nothing worse could happen to them than that Christ should leave them, and it was no light reproach that they rejected so disdainfully the grace of their visitation. 			 We must also observe here, that we ought to treat men in various ways, each according to his natural disposition. For, while our Lord attracts to him the teachable by the utmost mildness, supports the weak, and gently arouses even the sluggish, he does not spare those crooked serpents, on whom he perceives that no remedies can effect a cure.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.lvi-p25"></A><a name="ii.lvi-p25.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lvi-p26"></A><b><a name="ii.lvi-p26.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#020">Mark 9:20</a><a name="ii.lvi-p26.2"></A>.</b> <i>And as soon as he saw him.</i> That the devil should rage with more than ordinary cruelty against the man, when he is brought to Christ, ought not to excite surprise; for in proportion as the grace of Christ is seen to be nearer at hand, and acts more 			 powerfully, the fury of Satan is the more highly excited. The presence of Christ awakens him like the sound of a trumpet. He raises as violent a storm as he can, and contends with all his might. We ought to be prepared beforehand with such meditations, that our faith may not be disturbed, when the approach of the grace of Christ is met by more than ordinary violence on the part of our enemy. Nor ought we to lose sight of another point, that the true commencement of our cure is, when our 			 affliction is so heavy that we are almost at the point of death. It must also be taken into account that, by means of the furious attack of Satan, our Lord lights a torch to cause his grace to be seen; for, when the spectators were appalled at the dreadful spectacle, the display of the power of Christ, which immediately followed, was more distinctly perceived.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lvi-p28"></A><b>21. </b><i>From a child.</i> Hence we infer that this punishment was not inflicted on account of the sins of the individual, but was a secret judgment of God. True indeed, even infants, as soon as they have come out of the womb, are not innocent in the sight of God, or free from guilt; but God&#8217;s chastisements have 			 sometimes hidden causes, and are intended to try our obedience. We do not render to God the honor which is due to Him, unless with reverence and modesty we adore His justice, when it is concealed from us. Whoever wishes to obtain more full information on this point, may consult my <i>Commentary </i>on these words, <i>Neither hath this man sinned</i>,<i> nor his parents</i>, (<a name="ii.lvi-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#003">Joh 9:3</a><a name="ii.lvi-p28.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.lvi-p29"></A><a name="ii.lvi-p29.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lvi-p30"></A><b>22. </b><i>If thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.</i> We see how little honor he renders to Christ; for, supposing him to be some prophet, whose power was limited, he approaches to him with hesitation. On the other hand, the first foundation of faith is, to embrace the boundless power of God; and 			 the first step to prayer is, to raise it above all opposition by the firm belief that our prayers are not in vain. As this man did not suppose Christ to be at all different from other men, his false opinion is corrected; for our faith must be so formed as to be capable and prepared for receiving the desired favor. In his reply Christ does not administer a direct reproof, but indirectly reminding the man of what he had said amiss, points out to him his fault, and informs him how a remedy may be 			 obtained.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.lvi-p31"></A><a name="ii.lvi-p31.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lvi-p32"></A><b>23. </b><i>If thou canst believe.</i> &#8220;You ask me,&#8221; says he, &#8220;to aid you as far as I can; but you will find in me an inexhaustible fountain of power, provided that the faith which you bring be sufficiently large.&#8221; Hence may be learned a useful doctrine, which will apply equally to all of us, that it is not the Lord that 			 prevents his benefits from flowing to us in large abundance, but that it must be attributed to the narrowness of our faith, that it comes to us only in drops, and that frequently we do not feel even a drop, because unbelief shuts up our heart. It is an idle exercise of ingenuity to prove Christ&#8217;s meaning to be, that a man can believe of himself: for nothing more was intended than to throw back on men the blame of their poverty, whenever they disparage the power of God by their 			 unbelief.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lvi-p33"></A><i>All things are possible to him that believeth.</i> Christ undoubtedly intended to teach that the fullness of all blessings has been given to us by the Father, and that every kind of assistance must be expected from him alone in the same manner as we expect it from the hand of God. &#8220;Only exercise,&#8221; says he, &#8220;a firm belief, and you will 			 obtain.&#8221; In what manner faith obtains any thing for us we shall immediately see.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.lvi-p34"></A><a name="ii.lvi-p34.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lvi-p35"></A><b>24. </b><i>Lord, I believe.</i> He declares that he <i>believes</i>, and yet acknowledges himself to have <i>unbelief</i>  These two statements may appear to contradict each other, but there is none of us that does not experience both of them in himself. As our <i>faith </i>is never perfect, it follows that we are partly <i>unbelievers; </i>but God forgives us, and exercises such forbearance towards us, as to reckon us believers on account of a small portion of faith. It is our duty, in the 			 meantime, carefully to shake off the remains of infidelity which adhere to us, to strive against them, and to pray to God to correct them, and, as often as we are engaged in this conflict, to fly to him for aid. If we duly inquire what portion has been bestowed on each, it will evidently appear that there are very few who are eminent in faith, few who have a moderate portion, and very many who have but a small measure.</p>
