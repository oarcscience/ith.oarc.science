In Mark, indeed, he mitigates the harshness of his expression, by restricting it to those only 			 <i>who place confidence in riches</i>  But these words are, I think, intended to confirm, rather than correct, the former statement, as if he had affirmed that they ought not to think it strange, that he made the <i>entrance into the kingdom of heaven so difficult for the rich, </i>because it is an evil almost common to all to <i>trust in 			 their riches</i>  Yet this doctrine is highly useful to all; to <i>the rich</i>, that, being warned of their danger, they may be on their guard; to the poor, that, satisfied with their lot, they may not so eagerly desire what would bring more damage than gain. It is true indeed, that <i>riches </i>do not, in their own nature, hinder us from following God; but, in consequence of the depravity of the human mind, it is scarcely possible for those who have a great abundance to avoid being intoxicated by them. So they who are exceedingly <i>rich </i>are held by Satan bound, as it were, in chains, that they may not raise their thoughts to heaven; nay more, they bury and entangle themselves, and became utter 			 slaves to the earth. The comparison of the <i>camel</i>., which is soon after added, is intended to amplify the <i>difficulty; </i>for it means that <i>the rich </i>are so swelled with pride and presumption, that they cannot endure to be reduced to the straits through which God makes his people to pass. The word 			 <i>camel </i>denotes, I think, a rope used by sailors, rather than the animal so named.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_632"></A><A HREF="#fn_632"><FONT SIZE="1">633</FONT></A>

The disciples are astonished, </i>because it ought to awaken in us no little anxiety, that <i>riches </i>obstruct the <i>entrance into the kingdom of God; </i>for, wherever we turn our eyes, a thousand obstacles will present themselves. But let us observe that, while they were struck with astonishment, they did not shrink from the doctrines of Christ. The case was different with him who was lately mentioned; for he was so much alarmed by the severity of the commandment, that he separated from Christ; while they, though trembling, and inquiring<i>, who can be saved? </i>do not break off in an opposite direction, but are desirous to conquer despair. Thus it will be of service to us to tremble at the threatenings of God: whenever he denounces any thing that is gloomy or dreadful, provided that our minds are not discouraged, but rather aroused.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxxi-p20"></A><b>26.</b> <i>With men this is impossible.</i> Christ does not entirely free the minds of his disciples from all anxiety; for it is proper that they should perceive how difficult it is to ascend to heaven; first, that they may direct all their efforts to this object; and 			 next, that, distrusting themselves, they may implore strength from heaven. We see how great is our indolence and carelessness; and what the consequence would be if believers thought that they had to walk at ease, for pastime, along a smooth and cheerful plain. Such is the reason why Christ does not extenuate the danger &#8212; though he perceives the terror which it excited in his disciples &#8212; but rather increases it; for though formerly he said only that it was <i>difficult</i>, he now affirms it to be <i>impossible</i>  Hence it is evident, that those teachers are guilty of gross impropriety, who are so much afraid to speak harshly, that they give indulgence to the slothfulness of the flesh. They ought to follow, on the contrary, the rule of Christ, who so regulates his style 			 that, after men have been bowed down within themselves, he teaches them to rely on the grace of God alone, and, at the same time, excites them to prayer. In this manner, the weakness of men is seasonably relieved, not by ascribing anything to them, but by arousing their minds to expect the grace of God. By this reply of Christ is also refuted that widely embraced principle &#8212; which the Papists have borrowed from Jerome &#8212; &#8220;Whoever shall say that it is impossible to keep the law, let him be 			 accursed. &#8220;For Christ plainly declares, that it is not possible for men to keep the way of salvation, except so far as the grace of God assists them.</p>

Had due allowance been made for the boldness of Eastern imagery, the supposed difficulty would have disappeared, and the most refined taste would have been fully gratified.
