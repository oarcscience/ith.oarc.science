For his name was widely celebrated, and men spoke of him in 			 lofty terms: but his doctrine was held in less estimation, and there were even few that waited on his ministrations. Christ reminds them, that those who <i>went out to see him in the wilderness</i> lost their pains, if they did not devoutly apply their minds and faculties to his doctrine. The meaning of the words, <i>you went out into the wilderness, </i>is this: <i>&#8220;Your </i>journey would have been an act of foolish and ridiculous levity, if you had not a fixed object in view. But it was neither worldly splendor nor any sort of amusement   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A>
 			  that you were in quest of: your design was, to hear the voice of God from the mouth of the Prophet. If therefore you would reap advantage from your undertaking, it is necessary that what he spoke should remain fixed in your memory.&#8221;</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.iii-p19"></A><b>8. </b><i>Clothed with soft garments</i> Those who think that Christ here condemns the extravagance of a court are mistaken. There are many other passages in which luxury of dress, and excessive attention to outward appearance, are censured. But this passage simply means, that there was nothing 			 in the wilderness to attract the people from every quarter; that every thing there was rude and unpolished, and fitted only to inspire disgust; and that such elegance of dress as delights the eyes is rather to be looked for in the courts of kings.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.iii-p22"></A><b>11. </b><i>Verily I say to you</i> These words not only maintain the authority of John, but elevate his doctrine above the ancient prophets, that the people may keep in view the right end of his ministry; for they mistook the design of his mission, and, in consequence of this, derived almost 			 no advantage from his discourses. Accordingly, Christ extols and places him above the rank of the prophets, and gives the people to understand that he had received a special and more excellent commission. When he elsewhere says respecting himself that he was <i>not a Prophet, </i>(<a name="ii.iii-p22.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021">Joh 1:21</a><a name="ii.iii-p22.2"></A>,) this is not inconsistent with the designation here 			 bestowed upon him by Christ. He was, no doubt, a Prophet, like others whom God had appointed in his Church to be expounders of the Law, and messengers of his will; but he was <i>more excellent </i>than the Prophets in this respect, that he did not, like them, make known redemption at a distance and obscurely under shadows, but proclaimed that the time of redemption was now manifest and at hand. Such too is the import of Malachi&#8217;s prediction, 			 (<a name="ii.iii-p22.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001">Mal 3:1</a><a name="ii.iii-p22.3"></A>,) which is immediately added, that the pre-eminence of John consisted in his being the herald and forerunner of Christ;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A>
 			  for although the ancient Prophets spoke of his kingdom, they were not, like John, placed <i>before his face, </i>to point him out as present. As to the other parts of the passage, the reader may consult what has been said on the first chapter of Luke&#8217;s Gospel.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.iii-p25"></A><i>There hath not arisen</i> Our Lord proceeds farther, and declares that the ministers of the Gospel will be as far superior to John as John was superior to the Prophets. Those who think that Christ draws a comparison between himself and John have fallen into a strange blunder; for nothing is said here about personal rank, but commendation 			 is bestowed on the pre-eminence of office. This appears more clearly from the words employed by Luke, <i>there is not a greater Prophet; </i>for they expressly restrict his eminence to the office of teaching. In a word, this magnificent eulogium is bestowed on John, that the Jews may observe more attentively the commission which he bore. Again, the teachers who were afterwards to follow 			 are placed above him, to show the surpassing majesty of the Gospel above the Law, and above that preaching which came between them. Now, as Christ intended to prepare the Jews for receiving the Gospel, we ought also, in the present day, to be aroused to listen with reverence to Christ speaking to us from the lofty throne of his heavenly glory; lest he take revenge for our contempt of him by that fearful curse which he pronounces on unbelievers by Malachi in the same passage.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iii-p26"></A><i>The kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God</i> <a name="ii.iii-p26.1"></A>denote the new condition of the Church, as in other passages which have already occurred; for it was promised that at the coming of Christ all things would be restored. <i>He that is least in the kingdom. 			 </i><a name="ii.iii-p26.2"></A>The Greek word <a name="ii.iii-p26.3"></A>&#956;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#8057;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;<a name="ii.iii-p26.4"></A>, which I have rendered <i>least, </i><a name="ii.iii-p26.5"></A>is in the comparative degree, and signifies <i>less; </i><a name="ii.iii-p26.6"></A>but the meaning is more clearly brought out, that all the ministers of the Gospel are included. Many of them undoubtedly have received a small portion of faith, and are 			 therefore greatly inferior to John; but this does not prevent their preaching from being superior to his, because it holds out Christ as having rendered complete and eternal satisfaction by his one sacrifice, as the conqueror of death and the Lord of life, and because it withdraws the vail, and elevates believers to the heavenly sanctuary.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.iii-p27"></A><a name="ii.iii-p27.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.iii-p28"></A><b>12. </b><i>Since the days of John</i> I have no doubt that Christ speaks honorably of the majesty of the Gospel on this ground, that many sought after it with warm affection; for as God had raised up John to be the herald of the kingdom of his Son, so the Spirit infused such efficacy into his 			 doctrine, that it entered deeply into the hearts of men and kindled that zeal. It appears, therefore, that the Gospel, which comes forward in a manner so sudden and extraordinary,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A>
 			  and awakens powerful emotions, must have proceeded from God. But in the second clause is added this restriction, that <i>the violent take it by force</i> The greater part of men were no more excited than if the Prophets had never uttered a word about Christ, or if John had never appeared as his witness; and therefore Christ reminds them, that the 			 <i>violence, </i>of which he had spoken, existed only in men of a particular class. The meaning therefore is, A vast assembly of men is now collected, as if men were rushing <i>violently </i>forward to seize <i>the kingdom of God; </i>for, aroused by the voice of one man, they come together in crowds, and receive, not only with eagerness, but with vehement 			 impetuosity, the grace which is offered to them. Although very many are asleep, and are no more affected than if John in the wilderness were acting a play which had no reference to them, yet many flock to him with ardent zeal. The tendency of our Lord&#8217;s statement is to show, that those who pass by in a contemptuous manner, and as it were with closed eyes, the power of God, which manifestly appears both in the teacher and in the hearers, are inexcusable. Let us also learn from these words, what 			 is the true nature and operation of faith. It leads men not only to give, cold and indifferent assent when God speaks, but to cherish warm affection towards Him, and to rush forward as it were with a violent struggle.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.iii-p30"></A><a name="ii.iii-p30.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.iii-p31"></A><b><a name="ii.iii-p31.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#016">Luke 16:16</a><a name="ii.iii-p31.2"></A>. </b><i>The Law and the Prophets were till John</i> Our Lord had said that the earnestness of the people was a prelude to those things which <i>the Prophets </i>had foretold as to the future renovation of the Church. He now compares the 			 ministry of John to <i>the Law and the Prophets</i> &#8220;It is not wonderful,&#8221; he tells us, &#8220;that God should now act so powerfully on the minds of men; for he is not as formerly, seen at a distance under dark shadows, but appears openly and at hand for the establishment of his kingdom.&#8221; Hence it follows, that those who obstinately reject 			 <i>John&#8217;s </i>doctrine are less excusable than those who despised <i>the Law and the Prophets</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.iii-p32"></A><a name="ii.iii-p32.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.iii-p33"></A><b><a name="ii.iii-p33.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#013">Matthew 11:13</a><a name="ii.iii-p33.2"></A>. </b><i>All the Prophets and the Law itself Prophesied</i>. The word <i>prophesied </i>is emphatic; for <i>the Law and the Prophets </i>did not present God before the eyes of men, but represented 			 him under figures and shadows as absent. The comparison, we now perceive, is intended to show, that it is highly criminal in men to remain indifferent, when they have obtained a manifestation of the presence of God, who held his ancient people in suspense by predictions. Christ does not class <i>John </i>with the ministers of the Gospel, though he formerly assigned to him an intermediate station between them and <i>the Prophets. 			 </i>But there is no inconsistency here: for although John&#8217;s preaching was a part of the Gospel, it was little more than a first lesson.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.iii-p34"></A><a name="ii.iii-p34.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.iii-p35"></A><b>14. </b><i>And if you are willing to receive</i> <i>it</i> He now explains more clearly in what manner John began to preach <i>the kingdom of 			 God</i> It was in the character of that <i>Elijah, </i>who was to be sent before the face of God, (<a name="ii.iii-p35.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005">Mal 4:5</a><a name="ii.iii-p35.2"></A>.) Our Lord&#8217;s meaning therefore is, that <i>the great and dreadful day of the Lord, 			 </i>which Malachi described, is now beheld by the Jews, when <i>Elijah, </i>who was there promised, discharges his office as a herald. Again, by this exception, <i>if you are willing to receive it, </i>he glances at their hardened obstinacy, in maliciously 			 shutting their eyes against the clearest light. But will he cease to be <i>Elijah, </i>if he shall not be <i>received?</i> Christ does not mean that John&#8217;s official <i>character</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A>
 			  depends on their approbation; but having declared that he is <i>Elijah, </i>he charges them with carelessness and ingratitude, if he does not obtain that respect to which he is entitled.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.iii-p37"></A><a name="ii.iii-p37.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.iii-p38"></A><b>15. </b><i>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</i> We know that it is customary with Christ to introduce this sentence, whenever he treats of subjects which are highly important, and which deserve no ordinary attention.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A>
 			  He reminds us, at the same time, of the reason why the mysteries of which he speaks are not received by all. It is because many of his hearers are deaf, or at least have their ears closed. But now, as every man is hindered not only by his own unbelief, but by the mutual influence which men exercise on each other, Christ here exhorts the elect of God, whose ears have been pierced, to consider attentively this remarkable secret of God, and not to remain deaf with 			 unbelievers.</p>
