<p><a name="ii.xiv-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p5"></A><a name="ii.xiv-p5.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xiv-p6"></A><b>33.</b> <i>Either make the tree good</i> It might look like absurdity, that men should be allowed a choice of being <i>either good or bad; </i>but if we consider what sort of persons Christ 			 is addressing, the difficulty will be speedily resolved. We know what opinion was generally entertained about the Pharisees; for their pretended sanctity had so blinded the minds of the common people, that no one ventured to pass sentence on their vices.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">134</FONT></A>
 			  Wishing to remove this mask, Christ desires them to be <i>either good or bad</i>; or, in other words, declares that nothing is more inconsistent with honesty than hypocrisy, and that it is in vain for men to boast of pretensions to righteousness who are not sincere and upright.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">135</FONT></A>
 			  So then he puts nothing at their disposal, and withdraws no restraint from them, but only reminds them that their empty professions will avail them nothing so long as they are double, because they must be <i>either good or bad</i></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xiv-p9"></A>From the expression, <i>make the tree, </i>some foolishly infer, that it is in every man&#8217;s power to regulate his own life and conduct. It is a rhetorical mode of speaking, by which Christ points out the scribes, dispels&#8212;so to speak&#8212;the smoke of their hypocrisy, and recalls them to pure and genuine uprightness. He 			 afterwards explains the way and manner in which they may show that they are <i>good or bad trees; </i>which is by yielding <i>good or bad fruit: </i>so that there is no ambiguity in the meaning. The life of the scribes was not rendered infamous among men by gross vices. 			 Pride, ambition, and envy, displayed their venom in the slanders which they uttered; but as that venom was not perceived by ignorant people, Christ brings the concealed evil from its lurking-place, and drags it forth to light.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xiv-p10"></A>But perhaps it will be objected that, in consequence of the corruption of our nature, it is impossible to find any man who is altogether upright, and free from every vice. The answer is ready. Christ does not demand absolute and entire perfection, but only a sincere and unfeigned disposition, which the Pharisees whom he addresses were far from possessing. As Scripture applies the terms, <i>bad and wicked, </i>to those who are completely given 			 up to Satan, so the sincere worshippers of God, though they are encompassed by the infirmity of their flesh and by many sins, and groan under the burden, are called <i>good. </i>This arises from the undeserved kindness of God, who bestows so honorable a designation on those who aim at goodness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p11"></A><a name="ii.xiv-p11.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xiv-p12"></A><b>34.</b><i> Offspring of vipers.</i> The similarity between <i>the tree </i>and <i>the fruit </i>is here applied by Christ to nothing more than speech, because this afforded an opportunity of detecting the inward and concealed malice of 			 the scribes; and that is the reason why he dwells so much on this one kind of sin. It is because their falsehood and slanders betrayed what was not so visible in the rest of their life, that Christ attacks them with such severity. &#8220;There is no reason to wonder,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that you vomit out wicked words; for your heart is full of malice.&#8221; Nor are we to suppose that he ought to have treated them with greater gentleness, because some might regard this reproof as excessively severe. There are 			 other sins, no doubt, that call for harsh reproofs; but when hypocritical persons pervert what is right, or put a false coloring on what is sinful, such wickedness renders it necessary that God should thunder against it in a more terrible manner than against other sins.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text22"><a name="ii.xiv-p13"></A>Now the design of Christ, suggested by the present occurrence, was to condemn the wicked sophistry which turns light into darkness. This passage shows how highly valuable in the sight of the Lord truth is, since he maintains and defends it with such rigor. Would that this were earnestly considered by those persons, whose ingenuity is too ready to be employed in defending any cause, and whose venal tongue disguises impostures! In a particular 			 manner, Christ waxes wroth against those whom ambition, or envy, or some other fraudulent design, prompts to slander, even when there is nothing that their conscience condemns. Against the Pharisees, too, as his custom was, Christ used greater harshness, because they were so captivated by an unfounded conviction of their righteousness, that an ordinary warning had no effect upon them. And till hypocrites are sharply pierced,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">136</FONT></A>
 			 all that is said to them is treated with scorn and contempt.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xiv-p15"></A><i>How can you speak what is good?</i> We have formerly hinted, that proverbial sayings ought not to be rigidly interpreted as an invariable rule, for they state nothing more than the ordinary fact. Sometimes, no doubt, a cruel man will deceive the simple by honied flatteries, a cunning man will cheat under the garb of simplicity, and a man 			 of very wicked thoughts will breathe almost angelical purity of language.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">137</FONT></A>
 			  But the ordinary practice demonstrates the truth of what Christ here says, that <i>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh; </i>agreeably to the old proverb, which declared the tongue to be the index of the mind.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">138</FONT></A>
 			  And, indeed, whatever hidden and crooked recesses may exist in the heart of man, and whatever may be the amazing contrivances by which every man conceals his vices, yet the Lord extorts from each of them some kind of confession, so that they discover by the tongue their natural disposition and hidden feelings. We must also observe the purpose for which Christ employs those parables; for he reproaches the Pharisees with having manifested by words the malice which 			 they had inwardly conceived. Besides, knowing them to be sworn enemies, he takes occasion from, single calumny to expose their whole life, and to destroy their credit with the people, which gave them too great influence in deceiving and in doing mischief. Though <i>good </i>speeches do not always proceed from the inmost heart, but originate (as the phrase is) on the tip of the tongue, yet it is an invariable truth, that bad speeches are indications of 			 a bad heart.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p18"></A><a name="ii.xiv-p18.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xiv-p19"></A><b>36.</b> <i>Of every idle word</i> This is an argument from the less to the greater; for if <i>every idle word</i> is to be called in question, how would God spare the open blasphemies and 			 sacrilegious insolence of those who bark against his glory?   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">139</FONT></A>
 			  An <i>idle word </i>means one that is useless, or that yields no edification or advantage. Many look upon this as too severe;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">140</FONT></A>
 			  but if we consider the purpose for which our tongues were made, we will acknowledge, that those men are justly held guilty who unthinkingly devote them to trifling fooleries, and prostitute them to such a purpose. It is no light fault to abuse, for frivolous purposes, the <i>time, </i>which Paul enjoins us to be careful to <i>redeem, </i>(<a name="ii.xiv-p21.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016">Eph 5:16</a><a name="ii.xiv-p21.2"></A>; <a name="ii.xiv-p21.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005">Col 4:5</a><a name="ii.xiv-p21.3"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text22"><a name="ii.xiv-p22"></A>Now since no man is so cautious in speech, or maintains such a wise restraint upon himself, as never to allow some <i>idle words </i>to escape him, there remains for all of us absolute despair, if the Lord should treat us with rigor. But as the confident hope of our salvation rests on the assurance that God will <i>not enter into judgment </i>with us, (<a name="ii.xiv-p22.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002">Ps 143:2</a><a name="ii.xiv-p22.1"></A>,) but will bury in gracious forgetfulness the sins which deserve innumerable deaths,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">141</FONT></A>
 			 we entertain no doubt that, when he removes the condemnation of our whole life, he will likewise pardon the guilt of idle talking. When the judgment of God is mentioned in Scripture, it does not in any way set aside the forgiveness of sins. And yet let no man indulge himself, but let every man earnestly endeavor to <i>bridle his tongue, </i>(<a name="ii.xiv-p23.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026">Jas 1:26</a><a name="ii.xiv-p23.2"></A>.) First, let us speak of the sacred mysteries of 			 God with the utmost reverence and sobriety; secondly, let us abstain from talkativeness, buffoonery, and vain jests, and much more from slanderous attacks; and, lastly, let us endeavor to have <i>our speech seasoned with salt, </i>(<a name="ii.xiv-p23.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006">Col 4:6</a><a name="ii.xiv-p23.3"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p24"></A><a name="ii.xiv-p24.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xiv-p25"></A><b>37.</b> <i>By thy words thou shalt be justified</i> This was a common proverb, which he applied to the present subject; for I have no doubt that this was a saying which the people had frequently in their mouths, that &#8220;every man is condemned or acquitted by his own acknowledgment.&#8221; But Christ 			 turns it to a meaning somewhat different, that a wicked speech, being the indication of concealed malice, is enough to condemn a man. The attempt which the Papists make to torture this passage, so as to set aside the righteousness of faith, is childish. A man is <i>justified by his words,</i> not because his <i>speech </i>is the ground of his 			 justification, (for we obtain by faith the favor of God, so that he reckons us to be righteous persons;) but because pure <i>speech</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_141"><FONT SIZE="1">142</FONT></A>
 			  absolves us in such a manner, that we are not condemned as wicked persons by our tongue. Is it not absurd to infer from this, that men deserve a single drop of righteousness in the sight of God? On the contrary, this passage upholds our doctrine; for, although Christ does not here treat of the ground of our justification, yet the contrast between the two words points out the meaning of the word <i>justify. </i>The Papists reckon it absurd in us to say, that a man is justified by faith, because they explain the word <i>justified </i>to mean, that he becomes, and is, actually righteous; while we understand it to mean, that he is accounted righteous, and is <i>acquitted </i>before the tribunal of God, as is evident from numerous passages of Scripture. And is not the same thing confirmed by Christ, when he 			 draws a contrast between <i>justified </i>and <i>condemned?</i></p>
