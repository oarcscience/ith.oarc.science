<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxvi-p11"></A>We know that perseverance in prayer is a rare and difficult attainment; and it is a manifestation of our unbelief that, when our first prayers are not successful, we immediately throw away not only hope, but all the ardor of prayer. But it is an undoubted evidence of our Faith, if we are disappointed of our wish, and yet do not lose courage. Most properly, therefore, does Christ recommend to his disciples to persevere in praying.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxvi-p12"></A>The <i>parable </i>which he employs, though apparently harsh, was admirably fitted to instruct his disciples, that they ought to be importunate in their prayers to God the Father, till they at length draw from him what He would otherwise appear to be unwilling to give. Not that by our prayers we gain a victory over God, and bend him slowly and reluctantly to compassion, but because the actual facts do not all at once make it evident that he 			 graciously listens to our prayers. In the <i>parable </i>Christ describes to us a <i>widow, </i>who obtained what she wanted from an unjust and cruel <i>judge, </i>because she did not cease to make earnest demands. The leading truth conveyed is, that God does not all at once grant assistance to his people, because he chooses to be, as it were, wearied out by prayers; and that, however wretched and despicable may be the condition of those who pray to him, yet if they do not desist from the 			 uninterrupted exercise of prayer, he will at length regard them and relieve their necessities.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxvi-p13"></A>The parties between whom the comparison is drawn are, indeed, by no means equal; for there is a wide difference between a wicked and cruel man and God, who is naturally inclined to mercy. But Christ intended to assure believers that they have no reason to fear lest their persevering entreaties to the Father of mercy should be refused, since by importunate supplication they prevail on men who are given to cruelty. The 			 wicked and iron-hearted <i>judge</i> could not avoid yielding at length, though reluctantly, to the earnest solicitations of the widow: how then shall the prayers of believers, when perseveringly maintained, be without effect? If exhaustion and weakness are felt by us when we give way after a slight exertion, or if the ardor of prayer languishes because God appears to lend a deaf ear, 			 let us rest assured of our ultimate success, though it may not be immediately apparent. Entertaining this conviction, let us contend against our impatience, so that the long delay may not induce us to discontinue our prayers.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxvi-p15"></A><b>7. </b><i>And shall not God avenge his elect?</i> That <i>judge, </i>whom Christ has described to us as altogether desperate, as not only hardened against the contemplation of God, but so entirely devoid of 			 shame, that he had no anxiety about his reputation, at length opened his eyes to the distresses of the <i>widow</i> We have no reason to doubt that believers will derive, at least, equal advantage from their prayers, provided they do not cease to plead earnestly with God. Yet it must be observed that, while Christ applies the parable to his subject, he does not make God to resemble a 			 wicked and cruel <i>judge, </i>but points out a very different reason why those who believe in him are kept long in suspense, and why he does not actually and at once stretch out his hand to them: it is because he <i>forbears</i> If at any time God winks at the injuries done 			 to us longer than we would wish, let us know that this is done with a fatherly intention&#8212;to train us to patience. A temporary overlooking of crimes is very different from allowing them to remain for ever unpunished. The promise which he makes, that <i>God will speedily avenge them,</i> must be referred to his providence; for our hasty tempers and carnal apprehension lead us to conclude 			 that he does not come quickly enough to grant relief. But if we could penetrate into his design, we would learn that his assistance is always ready and seasonable, as the case demands, and is not delayed for a single moment, but comes at the exact time.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxvi-p16"></A>But it is asked, How does Christ instruct his disciples to seek vengeance, while he exhorts them on another occasion, <i>pray for those who injure and persecute you, </i>(<a name="ii.xxxvi-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044">Mt 5:44</a><a name="ii.xxxvi-p16.1"></A>.) I reply: what Christ says here about vengeance does not at all interfere with his former doctrine. God declares that he will avenge believers, not for the purpose of giving 			 a loose rein to their carnal affections, but in order to convince them that their salvation is dear and precious in his sight, and in this manner to induce them to rely on his protection. If, laying aside hatred, pure and free from every wicked desire of revenge, and influenced by proper and well-regulated dispositions, they implore divine assistance, it will be a lawful and holy wish, and God himself will listen to it. But as nothing is more difficult than to divest ourselves of sinful 			 affections, if we would offer pure and sincere prayers, we must ask the Lord to guide and direct our hearts by his Spirit. Then shall we lawfully call on God to be our avenger, and he will answer our prayers.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxvi-p18"></A><b>8. </b><i>When the Son of man shall come.</i> By these words Christ informs us that there will be no reason to wonder if men shall afterwards sink under their calamities: it will be because they neglect the true remedy. He intended to obviate an offense which we are daily apt to take, when we see all things in 			 shameful confusion. Treachery, cruelty, imposture, deceit, and violence, abound on every hand; there is no regard to justice, and no shame; the poor groan under their oppressors; the innocent are abused or insulted; while God appears to be asleep in heaven. This is the reason why the flesh imagines that the government of fortune is blind. But Christ here reminds us that men are justly deprived of heavenly aid, on which they have neither knowledge nor inclination to place reliance. They who do 			 nothing but murmur against the Lord in their hearts, and who allow no place for his providence, cannot reasonably expect that the Lord will assist them.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xxxvi-p19"></A><i>Shall he find faith on the earth?</i> Christ expressly foretells that, from his ascension to heaven till his return, unbelievers will abound; meaning by these words that, if the Redeemer does not so speedily appear, the blame of the delay will attach to men, because there will be almost none to look for him. Would that we did not 			 behold so manifest a fulfillment of this prediction! But experience proves that though the world is oppressed and overwhelmed by a huge mass of calamities, there are few indeed in whom the least spark of <i>faith </i>can be discerned. Others understand the word<i> faith </i>to denote uprightness, but the former meaning is more agreeable to the context.</p>
