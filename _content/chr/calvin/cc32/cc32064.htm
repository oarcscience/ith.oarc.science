<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p13"></A><b><a name="ii.lxiii-p13.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015">Matthew 18:15</a><a name="ii.lxiii-p13.2"></A>.</b> <i>But if thy brother shall sin against thee.</i> As he had discoursed about bearing the infirmities of brethren, he now shows more clearly in what manner, and for what purpose, and to what extent, we ought to bear with them. For otherwise it 			 would have been easy to reply, that there is no other way of avoiding offenses, than by every man winking at the faults of others, and thus what is evil would be encouraged by forbearance. Christ therefore prescribes a middle course, which does not give too great offense to the weak, and yet is adapted to cure their diseases; for that severity which is employed as a medicine is profitable and worthy of praise. In short, Christ enjoins his disciples to forgive one another, but to do so in such a 			 manner as to endeavor to correct their faults. It is necessary that this be wisely observed; for nothing is more difficult than to exercise forbearance towards men, and, at the same time, not to neglect the freedom necessary in reproving them.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_551"></A><A HREF="#fn_551"><FONT SIZE="1">552</FONT></A>
 			  Almost all lean to the one side or to the other, either to deceive themselves mutually by deadly flatteries, or to pursue with excessive bitterness those whom they ought to cure. But Christ recommends to his disciples a mutual love, which is widely distant from flattery; only he enjoins them to season their admonitions with moderation, lest, by excessive severity and harshness, they discourage the weak.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p15"></A>Now he distinctly lays down three steps of brotherly correction. The first is, to give a private advice to the person who has offended. The second is, if he shall give any sign of obstinacy, to advise him again in presence of <i>witnesses</i>. The third is, if no advantage shall be obtained in that way, to deliver him up to the public decision of <i>the Church</i>. The design of this, as I have said, is, to hinder charity from 			 being violated under the pretence of fervent zeal. As the greater part of men are driven by ambition to publish with excessive eagerness the faults of their brethren, Christ seasonably meets this fault by enjoining us to cover the faults of brethren, as far as lies in our power; for those who take pleasure in the disgrace and infamy of brethren are unquestionably carried away by hatred and malice, since, if they were under the influence of charity, they would endeavor to prevent the shame of 			 their brethren.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text22"><a name="ii.lxiii-p16"></A>But it is asked, Ought this rule to be extended indiscriminately to every kind of offense? For there are very many who do not allow any public censures, till the <i>offender </i>has been privately admonished. But there is an obvious limitation in the words of Christ; for he does not simply, and without exception, order us to advise or reprove privately, and in the absence of witnesses, all who have <i>offended</i>, but bids us 			 attempt this method, when we have been <i>offended </i>in private; by which is meant, not that it is a business of our own, but that we ought to be wounded and grieved whenever God is <i>offended</i>. And Christ does not now speak about bearing injuries, but teaches us in general to cultivate such meekness towards each other, as not to ruin by harsh treatment those whom we ought to save.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_552"></A><A HREF="#fn_552"><FONT SIZE="1">553</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p18"></A><i>Against thee.</i> This expression, as is evident from what we have said, does not denote an injury committed against any one, but distinguishes between secret and open sins.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_553"></A><A HREF="#fn_553"><FONT SIZE="1">554</FONT></A>
 			  For if any man shall <i>offend </i>against the whole Church, Paul enjoins that he be publicly reproved, so that even <i>elders </i>shall not be spared; for it is in reference to them that he expressly enjoins Timothy, to</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ii.lxiii-p20"></A>rebuke them publicly in presence of all, and thus to make them a general example to others, <br> 			 (<a name="ii.lxiii-p20.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#020">1Ti 5:20</a><a name="ii.lxiii-p20.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p21"></A>And certainly it would be absurd that he who has committed a public offense, so that the disgrace of it is generally known, should be admonished by individuals; for if a thousand persons are aware of it, he ought to receive a thousand admonitions. The distinction, therefore, which Christ expressly lays down, ought to be kept in mind, that no man may bring disgrace upon <i>his brother</i>, by rashly, and without necessity, divulging 			 secret offenses.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p22"></A><i>If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</i> Christ confirms his doctrine by its usefulness and advantage; for it is no small matter to <i>gain </i>to God a soul which had been the slave of Satan. And how comes it that those who have fallen do not often repent, but because they are 			 regarded with hatred, and treated as enemies, and thus acquire a character of hardened obstinacy? Nothing, therefore, is more appropriate than meekness, which reconciles to God those who had departed from him. On the other hand, he who inconsiderately indulges in foolish flattery willingly places in jeopardy the salvation of a <i>brother</i>, which he had in his hand.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p23"></A>According to <i>Luke</i>, Christ expressly enjoins us to be satisfied with a private reproof, if the <i>brother </i>be brought to <i>repentance</i>  Hence, too, we infer how necessary it is that 			 mutual freedom of reproof should subsist among believers. For, since each of us in many ways commits daily offenses, it would be outrageous cruelty to betray, by our silence and concealment, the salvation of those whom we might, by mild reproof, rescue from perdition. Though it does not always succeed, yet he is chargeable with heinous guilt, who has neglected the remedy which the Lord prescribes for promoting the salvation of the brethren. It is also worthy of notice, that the Lord, in order 			 to render us more zealous in performing our duty, ascribes to us that honor which is his own; for to him alone, and to no other, does it belong to convert a man; and yet he bestows on us this applause, though we did not deserve it, that we <i>gain a brother</i> who was lost.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.lxiii-p24"></A><a name="ii.lxiii-p24.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p25"></A><b>16. </b><i>But if he shall not hear thee.</i> The second step is, that he who displayed obstinacy, or refused to yield to one man, should be again admonished in presence of <i>witnesses</i>  Here some object, that it will 			 serve no purpose to call <i>witnesses</i>, if we have to deal with an obstinate and rebellious man, because their presence will be so far from leading him to acknowledge his guilt, that he will only make a more wicked denial. But this difficulty will be speedily removed, if we distinguish between <i>denial </i>and <i>evasion</i>  He who explicitly denies the fact, and declares that he is falsely and calumniously accused, must be left alone; for it would be ill vain to press him by calling <i>witnesses</i>  But as, in most cases, men 			 shamelessly evade, or impudently excuse, the improper and unjust actions which they have committed, till greater authority is employed, towards such persons it is useful to observe this method.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.lxiii-p26"></A><a name="ii.lxiii-p26.1"></A>That Christ&#8217;s discourse ought to be understood in this sense is evident from the word used, <a name="ii.lxiii-p26.2"></A>&#7956;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#958;&#959;&#957;<a name="ii.lxiii-p26.3"></A>,<i> reprove</i><a name="ii.lxiii-p26.4"></A>, <a name="ii.lxiii-p26.5"></A>or <i>argue; </i><a name="ii.lxiii-p26.6"></A>for to argue is to convince by demonstration.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_554"></A><A HREF="#fn_554"><FONT SIZE="1">555</FONT></A>
 			 <a name="ii.lxiii-p27.2"></A> And how could I <i>argue </i><a name="ii.lxiii-p27.3"></A>with a man   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_555"></A><A HREF="#fn_555"><FONT SIZE="1">556</FONT></A>
 			 <a name="ii.lxiii-p28.2"></A> who boldly denies the whole matter? for he who has the effrontery to deny the crime which he has committed shuts the door against a second admonition.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p29"></A>We now perceive for what purpose Christ proposes to call <i>witnesses</i>. It is, to give greater weight and impressiveness to the admonition. As to the slightly different meaning to which he has turned the words of Moses, it involves no absurdity. Moses forbids sentence to be pronounced on a matter that is unknown, and defines this to be the lawful mode of proving, that it be <i>established </i>by the testimony of</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ii.lxiii-p30"></A>two or three witnesses. At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established, <br> 			 (<a name="ii.lxiii-p30.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015">De 19:15</a><a name="ii.lxiii-p30.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text22"><a name="ii.lxiii-p31"></A>Alluding to that law, Christ says that, when two or three witnesses shall rise up to condemn the obstinacy of the man, the case will be clear, at least till the Church be prepared to take cognizance of it; for he who refuses to hear <i>two or three witnesses</i>  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_556"></A><A HREF="#fn_556"><FONT SIZE="1">557</FONT></A>
 			  will have no reason to complain that he is dragged forth to light.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p33"></A><i>Tell it to the Church.</i> It is asked, what does he mean by the term <i>Church? </i>For Paul orders (<a name="ii.lxiii-p33.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005">1Co 5:5</a><a name="ii.lxiii-p33.1"></A>) that the incestuous Corinthian shall be excommunicated, not by a certain chosen number, but by the whole assembly of the godly; and therefore it might appear to be probable that the power of judging is bestowed on the whole of the people. But as at that time no <i>Church</i> as yet was in existence, which acknowledged the authority of Christ, and no such order had been 			 established, and as our Lord employs the ordinary and received forms of expression, there can be no doubt that he alludes to the order of the ancient <i>Church</i>, as in other places also he accommodates his modes of expression to what was known and customary.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_557"></A><A HREF="#fn_557"><FONT SIZE="1">558</FONT></A>
 			  When he commands that:</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ii.lxiii-p35"></A>the offering, which we intend to present, shall be left at the altar, till we are reconciled to an offended brother, <br> 			 (<a name="ii.lxiii-p35.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#023">Mt 5:23</a><a name="ii.lxiii-p35.2"></A>,)</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p36"></A>he unquestionably intends, by means of that form of the worship of God which was then in existence and in force, to teach us, that we cannot in a right manner either pray, or offer any thing to God, so long as we are at variance with our brethren. So then he now looked at the form of discipline which was observed among the Jews; for it would have been absurd to propose an appeal to the judgment of a <i>Church</i> which was not yet in existence.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.lxiii-p37"></A><a name="ii.lxiii-p37.1"></A>Now since among the Jews the power of excommunication belonged to the elders, who held the government of the whole <i>Church</i><a name="ii.lxiii-p37.2"></A>, <a name="ii.lxiii-p37.3"></A>Christ speaks appropriately when he says that they who sinned must at length be brought forward publicly to <i>the Church</i><a name="ii.lxiii-p37.4"></A>, <a name="ii.lxiii-p37.5"></A>if they either despise haughtily, or ridicule and evade, the private admonitions. We know that, after the Jews returned from the Babylonish captivity, a council was formed, which they called <i>Sanhedrim</i><a name="ii.lxiii-p37.6"></A>, <a name="ii.lxiii-p37.7"></A>and in Greek <i>Synedrion</i><a name="ii.lxiii-p37.8"></A>, <a name="ii.lxiii-p37.9"></A>(<a name="ii.lxiii-p37.10"></A>&#963;&#965;&#957;&#8051;&#948;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;<a name="ii.lxiii-p37.11"></A>) and that to this council was committed the superintendence of morals and of doctrine. This government was lawful and approved by God, and was a bridle to restrain within their duty the dissolute and incorrigible.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p38"></A>It will perhaps be objected that, in the time of Christ, every thing was corrupt and perverted, so that this tyranny was very far from deserving to be accounted the judgment of <i>the Church</i>  But the reply is easy. Though the method of procedure was at that time depraved and perverted, 			 yet Christ justly praises that order, such as it had been handed down to them from the fathers. And when, shortly afterwards, he erected a <i>Church</i>, while he removed the abuse, he restored the proper use of excommunication. Yet there is no reason to doubt that the form of discipline, which prevailed in the kingdom of Christ, succeeded in the room of that ancient discipline. And certainly, since 			 even heathen nations maintained a shadowy form of excommunication, it appears that, from the beginning, this was impressed by God on the minds of men, that those who were impure and polluted ought to be excluded from religious services.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_558"></A><A HREF="#fn_558"><FONT SIZE="1">559</FONT></A>
 			  It would therefore have been highly disgraceful to the people of God to have been altogether destitute of that discipline, some trace of which remained among the Gentiles. But what had been preserved under the Law Christ has conveyed to us, because we hold the same rank with the ancient fathers. For it was not the intention of Christ to send his disciples to the synagogue, which, while it willingly cherished in its bosom disgraceful filth, excommunicated the true 			 and sincere worshippers of God; but he reminded us that the order, which had been formerly established in a holy manner under the Law, must be maintained in his <i>Church</i></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p40"></A><i>Let him be to thee as a heathen and a publican.</i> What is here added as to <i>heathens and publicans </i>confirms the interpretation which I have given. For <i>heathens and publicans </i>having been at that time regarded by the Jews with the 			 greatest hatred and detestation, he compares to them unholy and irreclaimable men, who yield to no admonitions. Certainly he did not intend to enjoin them to avoid the society of <i>heathens</i>, of whom <i>the Church </i>was afterwards composed; nor is there any reason at the present day why believers should shrink from associating with <i>publicans</i>  But in order that he might be more easily understood by the ignorant, Christ borrowed a mode of expression from what was then customary among his nation;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_559"></A><A HREF="#fn_559"><FONT SIZE="1">560</FONT></A>
 			 and the meaning is, that we ought to have no intercourse with the despisers of <i>the Church </i>till they repent.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.lxiii-p42"></A><a name="ii.lxiii-p42.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p43"></A><b>18. </b><i>What things soever you shall bind.</i> He now repeats the same words which he had formerly used, (<a name="ii.lxiii-p43.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019">Mt 16:19</a><a name="ii.lxiii-p43.1"></A>,) but in a different sense; for there he intended to maintain their authority in 			 doctrine, but here he appoints discipline, which is an appendage to doctrine. There Christ declared that the preaching of the Gospel would not be without effect, but that the <i>odor </i>of it would either be <i>life-giving </i>or <i>deadly</i>, (<a name="ii.lxiii-p43.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015">2 Cor. 2:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016">16</a><a name="ii.lxiii-p43.2"></A>:) here he affirms that, though wicked men ridicule the judgment of <i>the Church</i>, it will not be ineffectual. We must attend to this distinction, that <i>there </i>our Lord&#8217;s discourse relates to the preached word, but <i>here </i>to public censures and discipline. 			 Let the reader go to that passage for the import of the metaphor, <i>binding and loosin</i>g.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_560"></A><A HREF="#fn_560"><FONT SIZE="1">561</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p45"></A>The substance of it is this: Whoever, after committing a crime, humbly confesses his fault, and entreats <i>the Church</i> to forgive him, is absolved not only by men, but by God himself; and, on the other hand, whoever treats with ridicule the reproofs and threatenings of <i>the Church</i>, if he is condemned by her, the decision which men have given will be ratified in heaven. If it be objected, that in this way God is made a sort of petty judge, who concurs in the sentence of mortal men, the reply is at hand. For when Christ maintains the authority of his Church, he does not diminish his own power or that of his Father, but, on the contrary, 			 supports the majesty of his word. As in the former case (<a name="ii.lxiii-p45.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019">Mt 16:19</a><a name="ii.lxiii-p45.1"></A>) he did not intend to confirm indiscriminately every kind of doctrine, but only that which had proceeded out of his mouth, so neither does he say in this place that every kind of decision will be approved and ratified, but only that in which he presides, and that too not only by his Spirit, but by his word. Hence 			 it follows, that men do no injury to the authority of God, when they pronounce nothing but what comes from his mouth, and only endeavor faithfully to execute what he has commanded. For, though Christ alone is the Judge of the world, yet he chooses to have ministers to proclaim his word.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_561"></A><A HREF="#fn_561"><FONT SIZE="1">562</FONT></A>
 			  Besides, he wishes that his own decision should be pronounced by the Church; and thus he takes nothing from his own authority by employing the ministry of men, but it is Himself alone that <i>looses and binds</i></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p47"></A>But here a question arises. Since the Church endures many hypocrites, and likewise <i>absolves </i>(or <i>looses) </i>many whose professions of repentance are hypocritical, does it follow that such persons will be <i>absolved </i>(or <i>loosed) </i>in 			 heaven? I reply, the discourse is addressed to those only who are truly and sincerely reconciled to the Church. For Christ, wishing to administer comfort to trembling consciences, and to relieve them from fear, declares that any who may have offended are freed from guilt in the sight of God, provided that they be reconciled to <i>the Church</i>  For he has 			 appointed this as the pledge of heavenly grace, which has no reference to hypocrites, who pervert the proper use of reconciliation, but awakens in the godly no ordinary confidence, when they hear that their sins are blotted out before God and angels, as soon as they have obtained forgiveness from <i>the Church</i></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text22"><a name="ii.lxiii-p48"></A>In the other clause, Christ&#8217;s meaning is not at all ambiguous; for, since obstinate and haughty men are strongly inclined to despise the decision of the Church on this pretense, that they refuse to be subject to men &#8212; as wicked profligates often make bold appeals to the heavenly tribunal  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_562"></A><A HREF="#fn_562"><FONT SIZE="1">563</FONT></A>
 			 &#8212; Christ, in order to subdue this obstinacy by terror, threatens that the condemnation, which is now despised by them, will be ratified in heaven. He encourages his followers, at the same time, to maintain proper severity, and not to yield to the wicked obstinacy of those who reject or shake off discipline.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_563"></A><A HREF="#fn_563"><FONT SIZE="1">564</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text22"><a name="ii.lxiii-p51"></A>Hence, too, we may see how absurdly the Papists torture this passage to cloak every species of tyranny. That the right of excommunication is granted to the Church is certain, and is acknowledged by every person of sound judgment; but does it follow that any individual, even though not called by the <i>Church</i>, but elected  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_564"></A><A HREF="#fn_564"><FONT SIZE="1">565</FONT></A>
 			 by a mitered and disguised beast, shall at his own caprice throw out the useless squibs of excommunications?  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_565"></A><A HREF="#fn_565"><FONT SIZE="1">566</FONT></A>
 			 On the contrary, it is evident that the lawful government of the Church is committed to elders, and not only to the ministers of the word, but to those also who, taken from among the people, have been added to them for the superintendence of morals. And yet, not satisfied with this impudence, they endeavor even to prove from this passage that we must bear all the burdens which they shall impose. I do not mention that the power which has been granted to the Church is basely seized and 			 carried off by those outrageous enemies of the Church; and I only mention that, since Christ speaks only about correcting <i>offenders</i>, those who by their laws ensnare souls are chargeable with not less folly than wickedness in abusing this passage. Of the same stamp is their defense of their auricular confession on this pretense; for if Christ intended that those who by their own fault had been brought even to a public sentence should be reconciled to the Church, he does not 			 therefore lay an obligations  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_566"></A><A HREF="#fn_566"><FONT SIZE="1">567</FONT></A>
 			 on every individual to pour his sins into the ear of the priest. But their fooleries are so ridiculous, that it is unnecessary to spend any longer time in refuting them.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p56"></A><b>19. </b><i>Again I say to you.</i> He confirms the former statement; for not only will God bestow the spirit of wisdom and prudence on those who ask it, but he will also provide that not one thing which they shall do according to his word shall want its power and effect. By uniting <i>agreement 			 </i>with <i>prayer,</i> he reminds us with what moderation and humility believers ought to conduct themselves in all religious acts.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_567"></A><A HREF="#fn_567"><FONT SIZE="1">568</FONT></A>
 			  The <i>offender </i>must be admonished, and, if he does not receive correction, he must be excommunicated. Here it is not only necessary to ask counsel at the sacred mouth of God, so that nothing may be determined but by his word, but it is proper at the same time to begin with prayer. Hence appears more clearly what I have formerly stated, that men are not allowed the liberty of doing whatever they please,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_568"></A><A HREF="#fn_568"><FONT SIZE="1">569</FONT></A>
 			 but that God is declared to have the sole claim to the government of the <i>Church</i>, so that he approves and ratifies the decisions of which he is himself the Author. Meanwhile, when believers assemble, they are taught to unite their prayers and to pray in common, not only to testify the unity of faith, but that God may listen to the <i>agreement 			 </i>of them all. So then, as God frequently promises in other passages that he will graciously listen to the private requests of each individual, so here Christ makes a remarkable promise to public prayers, in order to invite us more earnestly to the practice of them.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p60"></A><b>20. </b><i>For where two or three are assembled in my name.</i> This promise is more extensive than the former; for the Lord declares that he will be present,</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ii.lxiii-p61"></A>wherever two or three are met together in his name, <br> 			 to guide them by his counsel, (<a name="ii.lxiii-p61.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#024">Ps 73:24</a><a name="ii.lxiii-p61.2"></A>,)</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text22"><a name="ii.lxiii-p62"></A>and to conduct to a prosperous result whatever they shall undertake. There is therefore no reason to doubt that those who give themselves up to his direction will derive most desirable advantage from his presence. And since it is an invaluable blessing to have Christ for our director in all our affairs, to bless our deliberations and their results; and since, on the other hand, nothing can be more miserable than to be deprived of his grace, 			 this promise ought to add no small excitement to us to unite with each other in piety and holiness.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_569"></A><A HREF="#fn_569"><FONT SIZE="1">570</FONT></A>
 			 For whoever either disregards the holy assemblies, or separates himself from brethren, and takes little interest in the cultivation of unity, by this alone makes it evident that he sets no value on the presence of Christ.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p64"></A>But we must take care, first of all, that those who are desirous to have Christ present with them shall <i>assemble in his name; </i>and we must likewise understand what is the meaning of this expression; for we perceive how ungodly men falsely and impudently, as well as wickedly, cover their conspiracies with his sacred name. If therefore we do not wish to expose Christ to their 			 ridicule, and at the same time to overturn what he has here promised, we must know first of all what is meant by this phrase. It means that those who are <i>assembled together</i>, laying aside every thing that hinders them from approaching to Christ, shall sincerely raise their desires to him, shall yield obedience to his word, and allow themselves to be 			 governed by the Spirit. Where this simplicity prevails, there is no reason to fear that Christ will not make it manifest that it was not in vain for <i>the assembly to meet in his name</i></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxiii-p65"></A>In this is displayed the gross ignorance of the Papists, who exclaim that Councils could not err, and that all ought to abide by their decisions, because, <i>as often as two or three are assembled in the name of Christ, he is in the midst of them</i>  But we ought first of all to inquire 			 whether those persons, as to whose faith, and doctrine, and dispositions, we are in doubt, were <i>assembled in the name of Christ.</i> When the Papists leave out or perplex this matter, who does not see that they dexteroasly confound the distinction between holy and profane assemblies, so that the power of doing any thing is taken from the Church and conveyed to the sworn enemies of 			 Christ? Let us therefore know that none but the pious worshippers of God, who sincerely seek Christ, are encouraged to entertain the confident hope that he will never leave them. Disregarding the bastard and abortive Councils, which out of their own head have woven a web, let Christ alone, with the doctrine of his Gospel, be always exalted amongst us.</p>
