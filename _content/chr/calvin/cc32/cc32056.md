mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, till
the Son of man be risen from the dead. **10**. And his disciples asked
him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
**11**. And Jesus answering said to them, Elijah indeed will come first,
and restore all things. **12**. But I say to you, That Elijah is come
already, and they did not know him, but have done to him whatever they
pleased: thus also will the Son of man suffer from them. **13**. Then
the disciples understood that he had spoken to them concerning John the
Baptist.  <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480)

<span id="ii.lv-p7"></span> 

<span id="ii.lv-p8"></span>**9**. And when they were going down from the
mountain, he charged them not to tell any man those things which they
had seen, till the Son of man had risen from the dead. **10**. And they
kept this saying among themselves, disputing with each other what was
the meaning of the expression which he had used, To rise from the dead.
**11** And they asked him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah
must come first? **12**. And he answering said to them, Elijah indeed
will come first, and restore all things; and, as it is written, the Son
of man must suffer many things and be despised. **13**. But I say to
you, That Elijah is come, and they have done to him whatever they
pleased, as it is written of him.

<span id="ii.lv-p9"></span> **36**. And they kept silence, and told no
man in those days any of those things which they had seen.

<span id="ii.lv-p10"></span> 

<span id="ii.lv-p11"></span> 

<span id="ii.lv-p12"></span><span id="ii.lv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lv-p13"></span>**<span id="ii.lv-p13.2"></span>[Matthew
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#009)<span id="ii.lv-p13.2"></span>.**
*And as they were going down from the mountain.* We have said that the
time for making known *the vision* was not yet fully come; and, indeed,
the disciples would not have believed it, if Christ had not given a more
striking proof of his glory in his resurrection. But after that his
divine power had been openly displayed, that temporary exhibition of his
glory began to be admitted, so as to make it fully evident that, even
during the time that he *emptied himself*, (<span
id="ii.lv-p13.3"></span>[Php 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007)<span
id="ii.lv-p13.3"></span>,) he continued to retain his divinity entire,
though it was concealed under the veil of the flesh. There are good
reasons, therefore, why he enjoins his disciples to keep silence, till
he be risen from the dead.

<span id="ii.lv-p14"></span><span id="ii.lv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lv-p15"></span>**10.** *And his disciples asked him,
saying.* No sooner is the resurrection mentioned than the disciples
imagine that the reign of Christ is commenced;  <span
id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481) for they explain this word to mean
that the world would acknowledge him to be the Messiah. That they
imagined the resurrection to be something totally different from what
Christ meant, is evident from what is stated by Mark, that *they
disputed with each other what was the meaning of that expression which
he had used, To rise from the dead* Perhaps, too, they were already
under the influence of that dream which is now held as an undoubted
oracle among the Rabbins, that there would be a first and a second
coming of the Messiah; that in the first he would be mean and despised,
but that this would be shortly afterwards followed by his royal dignity.
And, indeed, there is some plausibility in that error, for it springs
from a true principle. The Scripture, too, speaks of a first and a
second coming of the Messiah; for it promises that he will be a
Redeemer, to expiate by his sacrifice the sins of the world  <span
id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482) And such is the import of the
following prophecies:

<span id="ii.lv-p18"></span>Rejoice, daughter of Zion, behold, thy King
cometh, poor, sitting on an ass,  
(<span id="ii.lv-p18.2"></span>[Zec
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009)<span id="ii.lv-p18.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.lv-p19"></span>We beheld him, and he had no form or beauty,
and he resembled a leper, so that we had no esteem for him,  
(<span id="ii.lv-p19.2"></span>[Isa.
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004)<span id="ii.lv-p19.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.lv-p20"></span>Again, Scripture represents him as
victorious over death, and as subjecting all things to his dominion. But
we see how the Rabbins corrupt the pure word of God by their inventions;
and as every thing was greatly corrupted in the time of our Lord, it is
probable that the people had also embraced this foolish notion.

<span id="ii.lv-p21"></span>*Why do the scribes say that Elijah must
come first?* The gross mistakes which they committed as to the person of
*Elijah* have been pointed out on two or three occasions.  <span
id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483) Perhaps, too, they cunningly and
wickedly endeavored to lessen the authority of Christ by bringing
forward *Elijah;* for as it had been promised that *Elijah* would come
as the forerunner of Messiah, *to prepare the way before him*, (<span
id="ii.lv-p22.3"></span>[Mal. 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001),
[Mal. 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005)<span
id="ii.lv-p22.3"></span>,) it was easy to excite a prejudice against
Christ, by saying that he came unaccompanied by *Elijah* By a trick
closely resembling this, the devil enchants the Papists of the present
day not to expect the day of judgment till Elijah and Enoch have
appeared.  <span id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484) It may not usually be
conjectured that this expedient was purposely resorted to by the
scribes, in order to represent Christ as unworthy of confidence, because
he wanted the legitimate badge of the Messiah.

<span id="ii.lv-p24"></span><span id="ii.lv-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lv-p25"></span>**11.** *Elijah indeed will come first.* We
have stated elsewhere the origin of that error which prevailed among the
Jews. As John the Baptist was to resemble *Elijah* by restoring the
fallen condition of the Church, the prophet Malachi (<span
id="ii.lv-p25.2"></span>[Mal. 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006)<span id="ii.lv-p25.2"></span>) had
even given to him the name of *Elijah;* and this had been rashly
interpreted by the scribes, as if *Elijah the Tishbite* (<span
id="ii.lv-p25.3"></span>[1Ki 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001)<span
id="ii.lv-p25.3"></span>) were to return a second time to the world.
Christ now declares that every thing which Malachi uttered was true, but
that his prediction had been misunderstood and distorted from its true
meaning. “The promise,” says he, “that *Eliah* would come was true, and
has been already fulfilled; but the scribes have already rejected
Elijah, whose name they idly and falsely plead in opposing me.”

<span id="ii.lv-p26"></span>*And will restore all things.* This does not
mean that *John the Baptist restored* them perfectly, but that he
conveyed and handed them over to Christ, who would complete the work
which he had begun. Now as the scribes had shamefully rejected John,
Christ reminds his disciples that the impostures of such men ought not
to give them uneasiness, and that it ought not to be reckoned strange,
if, after having rejected the servant, they should, with equal disdain,
reject his Master. And that no one might be distressed by a proceeding
so strange, our Lord mentions that the Scripture contained predictions
of both events, that the Redeemer of the world, and Elijah his
forerunner, would be rejected by false and wicked teachers.
