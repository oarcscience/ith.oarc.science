<span id="vii.ii-p1"></span>THE ARGUMENT

<span id="vii.ii-p2"></span>ON

<span id="vii.ii-p3"></span>THE SECOND EPISTLE TO THE THESSALONIANS.

<span id="vii.ii-p4"></span>It does not appear to me probable that this
Epistle was sent from Rome, as the Greek manuscripts commonly bear; for
he would have made some mention of his bonds, as he is accustomed to do
in other Epistles. Besides, about the end of the third Chapter, he
intimates that he is in danger from unreasonable  <span
id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624) men. From this it may be gathered,
that when he was going to Jerusalem, he wrote this Epistle in the course
of the journey. It was also from an ancient date a very generally
received opinion among the Latins, that it was written at Athens. The
occasion, however, of his writing was this — that the Thessalonians
might not reckon themselves overlooked, because Paul had not visited
them, when hastening to another quarter. In the *first Chapter*, he
exhorts them to patience. In the *second*, a vain and groundless fancy,
which had got into circulation as to the coming of Christ being at hand,
is set aside by him by means of this argument — that there must
previously to that be a revolt in the Church, and a great part of the
world must treacherously draw back from God, nay more, that Antichrist
must reign in the temple of God. In the *third Chapter*, after having
commended himself to their prayers, and having in a few words encouraged
them to perseverance, he commands that those be severely chastised who
live in idleness at the expense of others. If they do not obey
admonitions, he teaches that they should be excommunicated.
