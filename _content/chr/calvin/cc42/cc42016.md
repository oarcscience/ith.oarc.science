<span id="vi.i-p1"></span>THE AUTHOR’S DEDICATORY EPISTLE.

<span id="vi.i-p2"></span>TO

<span id="vi.i-p3"></span>MATURINUS CORDERIUS,

<span id="vi.i-p4"></span>A MAN OF EMINENT PIETY AND LEARNING, PRINCIPAL
OF THE COLLEGE OF LAUSANNE.

<span id="vi.i-p5"></span>It is befitting that you should come in for a
share in my labors, inasmuch as, under your auspices, having entered on
a course of study, I made proficiency at least so far as to be prepared
to profit in some degree the Church of God. When my father sent me,
while yet a boy, to Paris, after I had simply tasted the first elements
of the Latin tongue; Providence so ordered it that I had, for a short
time, the privilege of having you as my instructor,  <span
id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484) that I might be taught by you the true
method of learning, in such a way that I might be prepared afterwards to
make somewhat better proficiency. For, after presiding over the first
class with the highest renown, on observing that pupils who had been
ambitiously trained up by the other masters, produced nothing but mere
show, nothing of solidity, so that they required to be formed by you
anew, tired of this annoyance, you that year descended to the fourth
class. This, indeed, was what you had in view, but to me it was a
singular kindness on the part of God that I happened to have an
auspicious commencement of such a course of training. And although I was
permitted to have the use of it only for a short time, from the
circumstance that we were soon afterwards advanced higher by an
injudicious man, who regulated our studies according to his own
pleasure, or rather his caprice, yet I derived so much assistance
afterwards from your training, that it is with good reason that I
acknowledge myself indebted to you for such progress as has since been
made. And this I was desirous to testify to posterity, that, if any
advantage shall accrue to them from my writings, they shall know that it
has in some degree originated with you.

<span id="vi.i-p7"></span>Geneva, 17th February 1550.
