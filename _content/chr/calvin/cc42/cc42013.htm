<p><a name="v.iv.i-p12"></A>To those fruitless exercises which the false apostles urged,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_428"></A><A HREF="#fn_428"><FONT SIZE="1">429</FONT></A>
 		as though perfection consisted in them, he opposes those true exercises in which it becomes Christians to employ themselves; and this has no slight bearing upon the point in hand; for when we see what God would have us do, we afterwards easily despise the inventions of men. When we perceive, too, that what God recommends to us is much more lofty and excellent than what men inculcate, our alacrity of mind increases for following God, so as to disregard men. Paul here exhorts the 		Colossians to meditation upon the heavenly life. And what as to his opponents? They were desirous to retain their childish rudiments. This doctrine, therefore, makes the ceremonies be the more lightly esteemed. Hence it is manifest that Paul, in this passage, exhorts in such a manner as to confirm the foregoing doctrine; for, in describing solid piety and holiness of life, his aim is, that those vain <i>shows</i> of human traditions may vanish.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_429"></A><A HREF="#fn_429"><FONT SIZE="1">430</FONT></A>
 		At the same time, he anticipates an objection with which the false apostles might assail him. What then? &#8220;Wouldst thou rather have men be idle than addict themselves to such exercises, of whatever sort they may be?&#8221; When, therefore, he bids Christians apply themselves to exercises of a greatly superior kind, he cuts off the handle for this calumny; nay more, he loads them with no small odium, on the ground that they impede the right course of the pious by worthless amusements.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_430"></A><A HREF="#fn_430"><FONT SIZE="1">431</FONT></A>
</p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.i-p16"></A><b>1. </b><i>If ye are risen with Christ.</i> Ascension follows resurrection: hence, if we are the members of Christ we must ascend into heaven, because he, on being raised up from the dead, was <i>received</i> <i>up</i> <i>into</i> <i>heaven</i>, (<a name="v.iv.i-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019">Mr 16:19</a><a name="v.iv.i-p16.1"></A>,) that he might draw us up with him. Now, we <i>seek those things which are above</i>, when in our minds   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_431"></A><A HREF="#fn_431"><FONT SIZE="1">432</FONT></A>
 		 we are truly sojourners in this world, and are not bound to it. The word rendered <i>think</i> <i>upon</i> expresses rather assiduity and intensity of aim: &#8220;Let your whole meditation be as to this: to this apply your intellect &#8212; to this your mind.&#8221; But if we ought to think of nothing but of what is heavenly, because Christ is in heaven, how much less becoming were it to seek 		Christ upon the earth. Let us therefore bear in mind that <i>that</i> is a true and holy <i>thinking</i> as to Christ, which forthwith bears us up into heaven, that we may there adore him, and that our minds may dwell with him.</p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.i-p18"></A>As to the <i>right hand of God</i>, it is not confined to heaven, but fills the whole world. Paul has made mention of it here to intimate that Christ encompasses us by his power, that we may not think that distance of place is a cause of separation between us and him, and that at the same time his majesty may excite us wholly to reverence him.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.iv.i-p19"></A><a name="v.iv.i-p19.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.i-p20"></A><b>2. </b><i>Not the things that are on earth.</i> He does not mean, as he does a little afterwards, depraved appetites, which reign in earthly men, nor even riches, or fields, or houses, nor any other things of the present life, which we must</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.iv.i-p21"></A>use, as though we did not use them,<br> 		(<a name="v.iv.i-p21.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#030">1 Cor. 7:30</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031">31</a><a name="v.iv.i-p21.2"></A>)   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_432"></A><A HREF="#fn_432"><FONT SIZE="1">433</FONT></A>
</p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.i-p23"></A>but is still following out his discussion as to ceremonies, which he represents as resembling entanglements which constrain us to creep upon the ground. &#8220;Christ,&#8221; says he, &#8220;calls us upwards to himself, while these draw us downwards.&#8221; For this is the winding-up and exposition of what he had lately touched upon as to the abolition of ceremonies through the death of Christ. &#8220;The ceremonies are dead to you through the death of Christ, and you 		to them, in order that, being raised up to heaven with Christ, you may think only of those things that are above. Leave off therefore earthly things.&#8221; I shall not contend against others who are of a different mind; but certainly the Apostle appears to me to go on step by step, so that, in the first instance, he places traditions as to trivial matters in contrast with meditation on the heavenly life, and afterwards, as we shall see, goes a step farther.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.iv.i-p24"></A><a name="v.iv.i-p24.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.i-p25"></A><b>3. </b><i>For ye are dead.</i> No one can rise again with Christ, if he has not first died with him. Hence he draws an argument from <i>rising</i> <i>again</i> to <i>dying</i>, as from a consequent to an antecedent,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_433"></A><A HREF="#fn_433"><FONT SIZE="1">434</FONT></A>
 		 meaning that we must be dead to the world that we may live to Christ. Why has he taught, that we must <i>seek those things that are above</i>? It is because the life of the pious is <i>above</i>. Why does he now teach, that the things which are on earth are to be left off? Because they are dead to the world. &#8220;Death goes before that resurrection, of which I have spoken. Hence both 		of them must be seen in you.&#8221;</p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.i-p27"></A>It is worthy of observation, that our <i>life</i> is said to be <i>hid</i>, that we may not murmur or complain if our life, being buried under the ignominy of the cross, and under various distresses, differs nothing from death, but may patiently wait for the day of revelation. And in order that our waiting may not be painful, let us observe those expressions, <i>in God</i>, and <i>with Christ</i>, which intimate that our life is out of danger, although it does not appear. For, in the <i>first</i> place, God is faithful, and therefore will not deny what has been <i>committed</i> to him, (<a name="v.iv.i-p27.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012">2Ti 1:12</a><a name="v.iv.i-p27.1"></A>,) nor deceive in the guardianship which he has undertaken; and, <i>secondly</i>, the fellowship of Christ brings still greater security. For what is to be more desired 		by us than this &#8212; that our life remain with the very fountain of life. Hence there is no reason why we should be alarmed if, on looking around on every side, we nowhere see life. For we are</p>  	 
<p class="Center"><a name="v.iv.i-p28"></A>saved by hope. But those things which are already seen with our eyes are not hoped for. (<a name="v.iv.i-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024">Ro 8:24</a><a name="v.iv.i-p28.1"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.i-p29"></A>Nor does he teach that our life is hid merely in the opinion of the world, but even as to our own view, because this is the true and necessary trial of our hope, that being encompassed, as it were, with death, we may seek life somewhere else than in the world.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.iv.i-p30"></A><a name="v.iv.i-p30.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.i-p31"></A><b>4. </b><i>But when Christ, our life, shall appear</i>. Here we have a choice consolation &#8212; that the coming of Christ will be the manifestation of our life. And, at the same time, he admonishes us how unreasonable were the disposition of the man, who should refuse to bear up   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_434"></A><A HREF="#fn_434"><FONT SIZE="1">435</FONT></A>

<p><a name="v.iv.ii-p12"></A><b>5. </b><i>Mortify therefore</i>. Hitherto he has been speaking of contempt of the world. He now proceeds further, and enters upon a higher philosophy, as to the <i>mortification of the flesh</i>. That this may be the better understood, let us take notice that there is a twofold <i>mortification</i>. The former relates to those things that are around us. Of this he has hitherto treated. The other is inward &#8212; that of the understanding and will, and of the whole of our corrupt nature. He makes mention of certain vices which he calls, not with strict accuracy, but at the same time elegantly, <i>members</i>. For he conceives of our nature as being, as it were, a mass made up of different vices. They are, therefore, our <i>members</i>, inasmuch as they in a manner stick close to us. He calls them also <i>earthly</i>, alluding to what he had said &#8212; <i>not</i> <i>the</i> <i>things</i> <i>that</i> <i>are</i> <i>on</i> <i>earth</i>, (<a name="v.iv.ii-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#002">Col 3:2</a><a name="v.iv.ii-p12.1"></A>,) but in a different sense. &#8220;I have admonished you, that earthly things are to be disregarded: you must, however, make it your aim to mortify those vices which detain you on the earth.&#8221; He intimates, however, that we are earthly, so long as the vices of our flesh are 		vigorous in us, and that we are made heavenly by the renewing of the Spirit.</p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.ii-p13"></A>After <i>fornication</i> he adds <i>uncleanness</i>, by which term he expresses all kinds of wantonness, by which lascivious persons pollute themselves. To these is added, <a name="v.iv.ii-p13.1"></A>&#960;&#8049;&#952;&#959;&#962; that is, <i>lust</i>, which includes all the allurements of unhallowed desire. This term, it is true, denotes mental perturbations of other kinds, and disorderly motions contrary to reason; but <i>lust</i> is not an unsuitable rendering of this passage. As to the reason why <i>covetousness</i> is here spoken of as a 		worshipping of <i>images</i>,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_435"></A><A HREF="#fn_435"><FONT SIZE="1">436</FONT></A>
 		 consult the Epistle to the Ephesians, that I may not say the same thing twice.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.iv.ii-p15"></A><a name="v.iv.ii-p15.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.ii-p16"></A><b>6. </b><i>On account of which things the wrath of God cometh</i>. I do not find fault with the rendering of Erasmus &#8212; <a name="v.iv.ii-p16.1"></A><i>solet</i> <i>venire</i> &#8212; (<i>is</i> <i>wont</i> <i>to</i> <i>come</i>,) but as the present tense is often taken in Scripture instead of the future, according to the idiom of the Hebrew language, I have preferred to leave the rendering undecided, so that it might be accommodated to either meaning. He warns the Colossians, then, either of the ordinary judgments of God, which are seen daily, or of the vengeance which 		he has once denounced upon the wicked, and which impends over them, but will not be manifested until the last day. I willingly, however, admit the former meaning &#8212; that God, who is the perpetual Judge of the world, is accustomed to punish the crimes in question.</p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.ii-p17"></A>He says, however, expressly, that the wrath of God will come, or is wont to come, upon the unbelieving or disobedient, instead of threatening them with anything of this nature.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_436"></A><A HREF="#fn_436"><FONT SIZE="1">437</FONT></A>
 		For God would rather that we should see his wrath upon the reprobate, than feel it in ourselves. It is true, that when the promises of grace are set before us, every one of the pious ought to embrace them equally as though they were designed for himself particularly; but, on the other hand, let us dread the threatenings of wrath and destruction in such a manner, that those things which are suitable for the reprobate, may serve as a lesson to us. God, it is true, is often said to be 		angry even with his children, and sometimes chastens their sins with severity. Paul speaks here, however, of eternal destruction, of which a mirror is to be seen only in the reprobate. In short, whenever God threatens, he shews, as it were, indirectly the punishment, that, beholding it in the reprobate, we may be deterred from sinning.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.iv.ii-p19"></A><a name="v.iv.ii-p19.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.ii-p20"></A><b>7. </b><i>In which ye walked.</i> Erasmus mistakingly refers this to men, rendering it, &#8220;<a name="v.iv.ii-p20.1"></A><i>inter</i> <i>quos</i>,&#8221; (&#8220;among <i>whom</i>,&#8221;) for there can be no doubt that Paul had in view the 		vices, in which he, says that the Colossians had walked, during the time that they lived in them. For <i>living</i> and <i>walking</i> differ from each other, as power does from action. <i>Living</i> holds the first place: <i>walking</i> comes afterwards, as in <a name="v.iv.ii-p20.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025">Ga 5:25</a><a name="v.iv.ii-p20.2"></A>,</p>

<p><a name="v.iv.ii-p22"></A>By these words he intimates, that it were an unseemly thing that they should addict themselves any more to the vices, to which they had died through Christ. See the sixth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans. It is an argument from a withdrawment of the cause to a withdrawment of the effect.</p>

 		 It is <i>put off</i> by all that are renewed by Christ.

The <i>old man</i>, however, comes first in order, because 		we are first born from Adam, and afterwards are born again through Christ. And as what we have from Adam becomes old,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_438"></A><A HREF="#fn_438"><FONT SIZE="1">439</FONT></A>
 		 and tends towards ruin, so what we obtain through Christ remains for ever, and is not frail; but, on the contrary, tends towards immortality. This passage is worthy of notice, inasmuch as a definition of regeneration may be gathered from it. For it contains two parts &#8212; the <i>putting off</i> of the <i>old man</i>, and the <i>putting on</i> of the <i>new</i>, and of these Paul here makes mention. It is also to be noticed, that the <i>old man</i> is distinguished by his works, as a tree is by its fruits.

Now, the <i>image of God</i> resides in the whole of the soul, inasmuch as it is not the reason merely that is rectified, but also the will. Hence, too, we learn, on the one hand, what is the end of our regeneration, 		that is, that we may be made like God, and that his glory may shine forth in us; and, on the other hand, what is the image of God, of which mention is made by Moses in <a name="v.iv.iii-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006">Ge 9:6</a><a name="v.iv.iii-p19.1"></A>,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_439"></A><A HREF="#fn_439"><FONT SIZE="1">440</FONT></A>
 		 the rectitude and integrity of the whole soul, so that man reflects, like a mirror, the wisdom, righteousness, and goodness of God. He speaks somewhat differently in the Epistle to the Ephesians, but the meaning is the same. See the passage &#8212; <a name="v.iv.iii-p20.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024">Eph 4:24</a><a name="v.iv.iii-p20.4"></A>. Paul, at the same time, teaches, that there is nothing more excellent at which the Colossians 		can aspire, inasmuch as this is our highest perfection and blessedness to bear the image of God.</p>

For the meaning of the statement is this, that Christian perfection does not stand in need of those outward observances, nay, that they are things that are altogether at variance with it. For under the distinction of <i>circumcision</i> and <i>uncircumcision</i>, of <i>Jew</i> and <i>Greek</i>, he includes, by <i>synecdoche</i>,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_440"></A><A HREF="#fn_440"><FONT SIZE="1">441</FONT></A>

They are, therefore, superfluous in a state of true perfection, nay more, they ought to have no place, inasmuch as injustice would otherwise be 		done to Christ, as though it were necessary to call in those helps for making up his deficiencies.</p>

For these are the effects and evidences of renovation.&#8221; Hence the exhortation depends on the second clause, and, accordingly, he keeps up the metaphor in the word rendered <i>put on</i></p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.iii-p28"></A>He mentions, first, <i>bowels of mercy</i>, by which expression he means an earnest affection, with yearnings, as it were, of the <i>bowels</i>: Secondly, he makes mention of <i>kindness</i>, (for in this manner I have chosen to render <a name="v.iv.iii-p28.1"></A>&#967;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#964;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#945;,) by which we make ourselves amiable. To this he adds <i>humility</i>, because no one will be kind and gentle but the man who, laying aside haughtiness, and high mindedness, brings himself down to the exercise of modesty, claiming nothing for himself.</p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.iii-p29"></A><i>Gentleness</i> &#8212; the term which follows &#8212; has a wider acceptation than <i>kindness</i>, for that is chiefly in look and speech, while this is also in inward disposition. As, however, it frequently happens, that we come in contact with wicked and ungrateful men, there is need of patience, that it may cherish mildness 		in us. He at length explains what he meant by <i>long-suffering</i> &#8212; that we embrace each other indulgently, and forgive also where any offense has been given. As, however, it is a thing that is hard and difficult, he confirms this doctrine by the example of Christ, and teaches, that the same thing is required from us, that as we, who have so frequently and so grievously offended, have nevertheless 		been received into favor, we should manifest the same kindness towards our neighbors, by forgiving whatever offenses they have committed against us. Hence he says,<i> if any one have a quarrel against another.</i> By this he means, that even just occasions of quarrel, according to the views of men, ought not to be followed out.</p>

For as all the things that he has hitherto enumerated flow from <i>love</i>, he now on good grounds exhorts the Colossians to cherish <i>love</i> among themselves, for the sake of these things &#8212; that they may be merciful, gentle, ready to forgive, as though he had said, that they would be such only in the 		event of their having <i>love</i>. For where <i>love</i> is wanting, all these things are sought for in vain. That he may commend it the more, he calls it the <i>bond of perfection</i>, meaning by this, that the troop of all the virtues   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_443"></A><A HREF="#fn_443"><FONT SIZE="1">444</FONT></A>
 		 is comprehended under it. For this truly is the rule of our whole life, and of all our actions, so that everything that is not regulated according to it is faulty, whatever attractiveness it may otherwise possess. This is the reason why it is called here the <i>bond of perfection</i>; because there is nothing in our life that is well regulated if it be not directed towards it, but everything that we attempt is mere 		waste.</p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.iv-p15"></A>The Papists, however, act a ridiculous part in abusing this declaration, with the view of maintaining justification by works. &#8220;<i>Love</i>,&#8221; say they, &#8220;is the <i>bond of perfection</i>: now perfection is righteousness; therefore we are justified by <i>love</i>.&#8221; The answer is twofold; for Paul here is not reasoning as to the manner in which men are made perfect in the sight of God, but as to the manner in which they 		may live perfectly among themselves. For the genuine exposition of the passage is this &#8212; that other things will be in a desirable state as to our life, if <i>love</i> be exercised among us. When, however, we grant that <i>love</i> is righteousness, they groundlessly and childishly take occasion from this to maintain, that we are justified by <i>love</i>, for where will perfect love be found? We, however, do not say that men are justified by faith alone, on the ground that the observance of the 		law is not righteousness, but rather on this ground, that as we are all transgressors of the law, we are, in consequence of our being destitute of any righteousness of our own, constrained to borrow righteousness from Christ. There remains nothing, therefore, but the righteousness of faith, because perfect love is nowhere to be found.</p>

 		 he who has vanquished all the others carries off the palm, so he would have the <i>peace of God</i> be superior to all carnal affections, which often hurry us on to contentions, disagreements, quarrels, secret grudges. He accordingly prohibits us from giving loose reins to corrupt affections of this kind. As, however it is difficult to restrain them, he points out also the remedy, that the <i>peace of</i> <i>God</i> may carry the victory, because it must be a bridle, by which carnal affections may be restrained. Hence he says, <i>in our hearts; </i>because we constantly feel <i>there</i> great conflicts, while the <i>flesh</i> <i>lusteth</i> <i>against</i> <i>the</i> <i>Spirit</i>.

<p><a name="v.iv.iv-p20"></A>The clause, <i>to which ye are called</i>, intimates what manner of <i>peace</i> this is &#8212; that unity which Christ has consecrated among us under his own direction.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_446"></A><A HREF="#fn_446"><FONT SIZE="1">447</FONT></A>

He adds, 		<i>in one body</i>, meaning by this, that we cannot be in a state of agreement with God otherwise than by being united among ourselves as members of one body. When he bids us be <i>thankful</i>, I do not take this as referring so much to the remembrance of favors, as to sweetness of manners. Hence, with the view of removing ambiguity, I prefer to render it, &#8220;Be 		amiable.&#8221; At the same time I acknowledge that, if gratitude takes possession of our minds,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_447"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">448</FONT></A>

<p><a name="v.iv.iv-p24"></A><b>16. </b><i>Let the word of Christ dwell.</i> He would have the doctrine of the gospel be familiarly known by them. Hence we may infer by what spirit those are actuated in the present day, who cruelly   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_448"></A><A HREF="#fn_448"><FONT SIZE="1">449</FONT></A>
 		 interdict the Christian people from making use of it, and furiously vociferate, that no pestilence is more to be dreaded, than that the reading of the Scriptures should be thrown open to the common people. For, unquestionably, Paul here addresses men and women of all ranks; nor would he simply have them take a slight taste merely of the <i>word of Christ</i>, but exhorts that it should <i>dwell in 		them</i>; that is, that it should have a settled abode, and that <i>largely</i>, that they may make it their aim to advance and increase more and more every day. As, however, the desire of learning is extravagant on the part of many, while they pervert the word of the Lord for their own ambition, or for vain curiosity, or in some way corrupt it, he on this account adds, <i>in all 		wisdom</i> &#8212; that, being instructed by it, we may be wise as we ought to be.</p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.iv-p26"></A>Farther, he gives a short definition of this wisdom &#8212; that the Colossians <i>teach one another</i> <i>Teaching</i> is taken here to mean profitable instruction, which tends to edification, as in <a name="v.iv.iv-p26.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#007">Ro 12:7</a><a name="v.iv.iv-p26.1"></A> &#8212; <i>He</i> <i>that</i> <i>teacheth</i>, <i>on</i> <i>teaching</i>; also in Timothy &#8212; &#8220;All Scripture is profitable for <i>teaching</i>.&#8221; (<a name="v.iv.iv-p26.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016">2Ti 3:16</a><a name="v.iv.iv-p26.2"></A>.) This is the true use of Christ&#8217;s word. As, however, doctrine is sometimes in itself cold, and, as one says,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_449"></A><A HREF="#fn_449"><FONT SIZE="1">450</FONT></A>
 		 when it is simply shewn what is right, virtue is praised   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_450"></A><A HREF="#fn_450"><FONT SIZE="1">451</FONT></A>
 		 and left to starve,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_451"></A><A HREF="#fn_451"><FONT SIZE="1">452</FONT></A>
 		 he adds at the same time admonition, which is, as it were, a confirmation of doctrine and incitement to it. Nor does he mean that the <i>word of Christ</i> ought to be of benefit merely to individuals, that they may teach themselves, but he requires mutual teaching and admonition.</p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.iv-p30"></A><i>Psalms, hymns</i>. He does not restrict the <i>word</i> <i>of</i> <i>Christ</i> to these particular departments, but rather intimates that all our communications should be adapted to edification, that even 		those which tend to hilarity may have no empty savor. &#8220;<i>Leave</i> to unbelievers that foolish delight which they take from ludicrous and frivolous jests and witticisms;   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_452"></A><A HREF="#fn_452"><FONT SIZE="1">453</FONT></A>
 		 and let your communications, not merely those that are grave, but those also that are joyful and exhilarating, contain something profitable. In place of their obscene, or at least barely modest and <i>decent</i>, songs, it <i>becomes</i> you to make use of hymns and songs that sound forth God&#8217;s praise.&#8221; Farther, under these three terms he includes all kinds of songs. They are 		commonly distinguished in this way &#8212; that a <i>psalm</i> is that, in the singing of which some musical instrument besides the tongue is made use of: a <i>hymn</i> is properly a song of praise, whether it be sung simply with the voice or otherwise; while an <i>ode</i> contains not merely praises, but exhortations and other matters. He would have the songs of 		Christians, however, to be <i>spiritual</i>, not made up of frivolities and worthless trifles. For this has a connection with his argument.</p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.iv-p32"></A>The clause, <i>in grace</i>, Chrysostom explains in different ways. I, however, take it simply, as also afterwards, in <a name="v.iv.iv-p32.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006">Col 4:6</a><a name="v.iv.iv-p32.1"></A>, where he says, &#8220;Let your speech be seasoned with salt, <i>in 		grace</i>,&#8221; that is, by way of a dexterity that may be agreeable, and may please the hearers by its profitableness, so that it may be opposed to buffoonery and similar trifles.</p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.iv-p33"></A><i>Singing in your hearts.</i> This relates to disposition; for as we ought to stir up others, so we ought also to sing from the heart, that there may not be merely an external sound with the mouth. At the same time, we must not understand it as though he would have every one sing inwardly to himself, but he would have both conjoined, provided the heart goes 		before the tongue.</p>

<p><a name="v.iv.iv-p35"></A><b>17</b><i>. And whatsoever ye do.</i> We have already explained these things, and what goes before, in the Epistle to the Ephesians, where the same things are said almost word for word. As he had already begun to discourse in reference to different 		parts of the Christian life, and had simply touched upon a few precepts, it would have been too tedious a thing to follow out the rest one by one, he therefore concludes in a summary way, that life must be regulated in such a manner, that whatever we say or do may be wholly governed by the authority of Christ, and may have an eye to his glory as the mark.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_453"></A><A HREF="#fn_453"><FONT SIZE="1">454</FONT></A>

 		 may set out with invocation of Christ, and may be subservient to his glory. From invocation follows the act of blessing God, which supplies us with matter of thanksgiving.

 		 should feel disposed to constrain them to anything that is unlawful; will they in that case, too, obey without any reservation? Now it were worse than unreasonable, that the, authority of men should prevail at the expense of neglecting God. I answer, that here, too, we must understand as implied what he expresses elsewhere, (<a name="v.iv.v-p27.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001">Eph 6:1</a><a name="v.iv.v-p27.2"></A>) &#8212; <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>Lord</i>. But for what purpose does he employ a term of universality? I answer again, that it is to shew, that obedience must be rendered not merely to just commands, but also to such as are unreasonable.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_459"></A><A HREF="#fn_459"><FONT SIZE="1">460</FONT></A>
 		 For many make themselves compliant with the wishes of their parents only where the command is not grievous or inconvenient. But, on the other hand, this one thing ought to be considered by children &#8212; that whoever may be their parents, they have been allotted to them by the providence of God, who by his appointment makes children subject to their parents.</p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.v-p29"></A><i>In all things,</i> therefore, that they may not refuse anything, however difficult or disagreeable &#8212; <i>in all things</i>, that in things indifferent they may give deference to the station which their parents occupy &#8212; <i>in all things</i>, that they may not put themselves on a 		footing of equality with their parents, in the way of questioning and debating, or disputing, it being always understood that conscience is not to be infringed upon.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_460"></A><A HREF="#fn_460"><FONT SIZE="1">461</FONT></A>
 		 He prohibits parents from exercising an immoderate harshness, lest their children should be so disheartened as to be incapable of receiving any honorable training; for we see, from daily experience, the advantage of a liberal education.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.iv.v-p31"></A><a name="v.iv.v-p31.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.v-p32"></A><b>22</b> <i>Servants, be obedient.</i> Anything that is stated here respecting <i>servants</i> requires no exposition, as it has been already expounded in commenting on <a name="v.iv.v-p32.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001">Ephesians 6:1</a><a name="v.iv.v-p32.2"></A>, with the exception of these two expressions, &#8212; <i>For we serve the Lord Christ</i>; and, <i>He that will act unjustly will receive the reward of his iniquity.</i></p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.v-p33"></A>By the former statement he means, that service is done to men in such a way that Christ at the same time holds supremacy of dominion, and is the supreme master. Here, truly, is choice consolation for all that are under subjection, inasmuch as they are informed that, while they willingly serve their masters, their services are acceptable to Christ, as though they had been rendered to him. From this, also, Paul gathers, that 		they will <i>receive</i> from him <i>a reward</i>, but it is the <i>reward of inheritance</i>, by which he means that the very thing that is bestowed in reward of works is freely given to us by God, for <i>inheritance</i> comes from adoption.</p>  	 
<p><a name="v.iv.v-p34"></A>In the second clause he again comforts <i>servants</i>, by saying that, if they are oppressed by the unjust cruelty of their masters, God himself will take vengeance, and will not, on the ground that they are <i>servants,</i> overlook the injuries inflicted upon them, inasmuch as there is <i>no respect of persons with him</i>. For this consideration might diminish their courage, if they imagined that God had no regard for them, or no great regard, and that their miseries gave him no concern. Besides, it often happens that servants themselves endeavor to avenge injurious and cruel treatment. He obviates, accordingly, this evil, by admonishing them to wait patiently the judgment of God.</p>
