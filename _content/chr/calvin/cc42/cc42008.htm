<p><a name="iv.v.i-p10"></A><b>1.</b> <i>Therefore, my brethren</i> He concludes his doctrine, as he is wont, with most urgent exhortations, that he may fix it the more firmly in the minds of men. He also insinuates himself into their affections by endearing appellations   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_207"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">208</FONT></A>
 		, which at the same time are not dictated by flattery, but by sincere affection. He calls them his <i>joy </i>and <i>crown; </i>because, delighted to see those who had been gained over through his instrumentality persevering in the faith   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_208"></A><A HREF="#fn_208"><FONT SIZE="1">209</FONT></A>
 		, he hoped to attain that triumph, of which we have spoken   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">210</FONT></A>
 		, when the Lord will reward with a <i>crown </i>those things which have been accomplished under his guidance.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p14"></A>When he bids them <i>so stand fast in the Lord, </i>he means that their condition is approved of by him. At the same time, the particle <i>so </i>might be taken as referring to the doctrine going before; but the former view is more suitable, so that, by praising their 		present condition, he exhorts them to perseverance. They had already, it is true, given some evidence of their constancy. Paul, however, well knowing human weakness, reckons that they have need of confirmation for the future.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v.i-p15"></A><a name="iv.v.i-p15.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p16"></A><b>2.</b> <i>I exhort Euodias and Syntyche</i> It is an almost universally received opinion that Paul was desirous to settle a quarrel, I know not of what sort, between those two women. While I am not inclined to contend as to this, the words of Paul do not afford ground enough for such a 		conjecture to satisfy us that it really was so. It appears, from the testimony which he gives in their favor, that they were very excellent women; for he assigns to them so much honor as to call them fellow-soldiers in the gospel   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">211</FONT></A>
 		. Hence, as their agreement was a matter of great moment   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">212</FONT></A>
 		, and, on the other hand, there would be great danger attendant on their disagreement, he stirs them up particularly to concord.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p19"></A>We must take notice, however, that, whenever he speaks of agreement, he adds also the bond of it&#8212;<i>in the</i> <i>Lord. </i>For every combination will inevitably be accursed, if apart from the Lord, and, on the other hand, nothing is so disjoined, but that it ought to be reunited in Christ.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v.i-p20"></A><a name="iv.v.i-p20.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p21"></A><b>3</b>  <i>I entreat thee, also, true yokefellow</i> I am not inclined to dispute as to the gender of the noun, and shall, accordingly, leave it undetermined   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">213</FONT></A>
 		, whether he addresses here a man or a woman. At the same time there is excessive weakness in the argument of Erasmus, who infers that it is a woman from the circumstance, that mention is made here of other women &#8212; as though he did not immediately subjoin the name of Clement in the same connection. I refrain, however, from that dispute: only I maintain that it is not Paul&#8217;s wife that is designated by this appellation. Those who maintain this, quote Clement and 		Ignatius as their authorities. If they quoted correctly, I would not certainly despise men of such eminence. But as writings are brought forward from Eusebius   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">214</FONT></A>
 		 which are spurious, and were contrived by ignorant monks   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">215</FONT></A>
 		, they are not deserving of much credit among readers of sound judgment   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_215"></A><A HREF="#fn_215"><FONT SIZE="1">216</FONT></A>
 		</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p26"></A>Let us, therefore, inquire as to the thing itself, without taking any false impression from the opinions of men. When Paul wrote the First Epistle to the Corinthians, he was, as he mentions, at that time unmarried.</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.v.i-p27"></A>&#8220;To the unmarried,&#8221; says he, &#8220;and widows, I say it is good that they should continue even as I am&#8221; (<a name="iv.v.i-p27.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#008">1Co 7:8</a><a name="iv.v.i-p27.1"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p28"></A> He wrote that Epistle at Ephesus  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">217</FONT></A>
 		when he was prepared to leave it. Not long after, he proceeded to Jerusalem, where he was put in prison, and sent to Rome. Every one must perceive how unsuitable a period of time it would have been for marrying a wife, spent by him partly in journeying, and partly in prison. In addition to this, he was even at that time prepared to endure imprisonment and persecutions, as he himself testifies, according to Luke. (<a name="iv.v.i-p29.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#013">Ac 21:13</a><a name="iv.v.i-p29.4"></A>.) I am, at the same time, well aware what objection is usually brought forward in opposition to this &#8212; that Paul, though married, refrained from conjugal intercourse. The words, however, convey another meaning, for he is desirous that unmarried persons may have it in their power to remain in the same condition with himself. Now, what is that condition but celibacy? As to their bringing forward that passage &#8212;</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.v.i-p30"></A>Is it not lawful for me to lead about a wife (<a name="iv.v.i-p30.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#005">1Co 9:5</a><a name="iv.v.i-p30.1"></A>,)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p31"></A>for the purpose of proving he had a wife, it is too silly to require any refutation   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">218</FONT></A>
 		. But granting that Paul was married, how <i>came </i>his wife to be at Philippi &#8212; a city which we do not read of his entering on more than two occasions, and in which it is probable he never remained so much as two whole months? In fine, nothing is more unlikely than that he speaks here of his wife; and to me it does not seem probable that he speaks of any female. I leave it, however, to the judgment of my readers. The 		word which Paul makes use of here (<a name="iv.v.i-p32.3"></A>&#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#8049;&#956;&#946;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;<i>) </i>means, to take hold of a thing and embrace it along with another person, with the view of giving help   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_218"></A><A HREF="#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">219</FONT></A>
 		</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p34"></A><i>Whose names are in the book of life</i> The <i>book of life </i>is the roll of the righteous, who are predestinated to life, as in the writings of Moses. (<a name="iv.v.i-p34.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032">Ex 32:32</a><a name="iv.v.i-p34.1"></A>.) God has this 		roll beside himself in safekeeping. Hence the book is nothing else than His eternal counsel, fixed in His own breast. In place of this term, Ezekiel employs this expression &#8212; <i>the writing of the house of Israel. </i>With the same view it is said in</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.v.i-p35"></A>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and let them not be written among the righteous; (<a name="iv.v.i-p35.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028">Ps 69:28</a><a name="iv.v.i-p35.1"></A>)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p36"></A>that is, let them not be numbered among the elect of God, whom he receives within the limits of his Church and kingdom  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_219"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">220</FONT></A>
 		.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p38"></A>Should any one allege, that Paul therefore acts rashly in usurping to himself the right of pronouncing as to the secrets of God, I answer, that we may in some measure form a judgment from the token by which God manifests his election, but only in so far as our capacity admits. In all those, therefore, in whom we see the marks of adoption shine forth, let us in the mean time reckon those to be the sons of God until the <i>books are opened, 		</i>(<a name="iv.v.i-p38.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012">Re 20:12</a><a name="iv.v.i-p38.1"></A>,) which will thoroughly bring all things to view. It belongs, it is true, to God alone now to <i>know them that are his, </i>(<a name="iv.v.i-p38.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019">2Ti 2:19</a><a name="iv.v.i-p38.2"></A>,) and to separate at least the lambs from the kids;  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">221</FONT></A>
 		but it is our part to reckon in charity all to be lambs who, in a spirit of obedience, submit themselves to Christ as their Shepherd  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">222</FONT></A>
 		, who betake themselves to his fold, and remain there constantly. It is our part to set so high a value upon the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which he confers peculiarly on his elect, that they shall be to us the seals, as it were, of an election which is hid from us.</p>  <a name="iv.v.ii"></A>  	  		 		     		  
<p class="TableCaption16"><a name="iv.v.ii-p1"></A><a name="iv.v.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004">Philippians 4:4-9</a><a name="iv.v.ii-p1.1"></A></p>

<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p8"></A><b>7</b>. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</p>

<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p10"></A><b>8</b>. Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things <i>are</i> honest, whatsoever things <i>are</i> just, whatsoever things <i>are</i> pure, whatsoever things <i>are</i> lovely, whatsoever things <i>are</i> of good report; if <i>there be</i> any virtue, and if <i>there be</i> any praise, think on these things</p> 		     		  
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p11"></A><b>8</b>. Quod reliquum est, fratres, quaecunque sunt vera, quaecunque gravia, qaecunque iusta, quaecunque pura, quaecunque amabilia, quaecunque honesta: si qua virtus, et qua laus, haec cogitate.</p> 		    		 		     		  
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p12"></A><b>9</b>. Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</p> 		     		  
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p13"></A><b>9</b>. Quae et didicistis, et suscepistis, et audistis, et vidistis in me: haec facite, et Deus pacis erit vobiscum.</p> 		    		  	   	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p14"></A>&nbsp;</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v.ii-p15"></A><a name="iv.v.ii-p15.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p16"></A><b>4.</b> <i>Rejoice in the Lord</i> It is an exhortation suited to the times; for, as the condition of the pious was exceedingly troublous, and dangers threatened them on every side, it was possible that they might give way, overcome by grief or impatience.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">223</FONT></A>
 		 Hence he enjoins it upon them, that, amidst circumstances of hostility and disturbance, they should nevertheless <i>rejoice in the Lord,</i>   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">224</FONT></A>
 		 as assuredly these spiritual consolations, by means of which the Lord refreshes and gladdens us, ought <i>then </i>most of all to show their efficacy when the whole world tempts us to despair. Let us, however, in connection with the circumstances of the times, consider what efficacy there must have been in this word uttered by the mouth of Paul, who might have had special occasion of 		sorrow.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">225</FONT></A>
 		 For if they are appalled by persecutions, or imprisonments, or exile, or death, here is the Apostle setting himself forward, who, amidst imprisonments, in the very heat of persecution, and in fine, amidst apprehensions of death, is not merely himself joyful, but even stirs up others to joy. The sum, then, is this &#8212; that come what may, believers, having the Lord standing on their side   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_225"><FONT SIZE="1">226</FONT></A>
 		, have amply sufficient ground of joy.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p21"></A>The repetition of the exhortation serves to give greater force to it: Let this be your strength and stability, to <i>rejoice in the Lord, </i>and that, too, not for a moment merely, but so that your joy in him may be perpetuated.  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_226"><FONT SIZE="1">227</FONT></A>
 		For unquestionably it differs from the joy of the world in this respect &#8212; that we know from experience that the joy of the world is deceptive, frail, and fading, and Christ even pronouces it to be accursed (<a name="iv.v.ii-p22.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#025">Lu 6:25</a><a name="iv.v.ii-p22.2"></A>). Hence, that only is a settled joy in God which is such as is never taken away from us.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v.ii-p23"></A><a name="iv.v.ii-p23.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p24"></A><b>5</b> <i>Your moderation</i> This may be explained in two ways. We may understand him as bidding them rather give up their right, than that any one should have occasion to complain of their sharpness or severity. <i>&#8220;</i>Let<i> 		</i>all that have to deal with you have experience of your equity and humanity.&#8221; In this way to <i>know, </i>will mean to <i>experience. </i>Or we may understand him as exhorting them to endure all things with equanimity.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_227"></A><A HREF="#fn_227"><FONT SIZE="1">228</FONT></A>
 		 This latter meaning I rather prefer; for is a term that is made use of by the Greeks themselves to denote moderation of spirit &#8212; when we are not easily moved by injuries, when we are not easily annoyed by adversity, but retain equanimity of temper. In accordance with this, Cicero makes use of the following expression, &#8212; &#8220;My mind is tranquil, which takes everything in good part.&#8221;   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_228"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">229</FONT></A>
 		 Such equanimity &#8212; which is as it were the mother of patience &#8212; he requires here on the part of the Philippians, and, indeed, such as will manifest itself to all, according as occasion will require, by producing its proper effects. The term <i>modesty </i>does not seem appropriate here, because Paul is not in this passage cautioning them against haughty insolence, but directs them to conduct themselves peaceably in 		everything, and exercise control over themselves, even in the endurance of injuries or inconveniences.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p27"></A><i>The Lord is at hand</i> Here we have an <i>anticipation, </i>by which he obviates an objection that might be brought forward. For carnal sense rises in opposition to the foregoing statement. For as the rage of the wicked is the more inflamed in proportion to our mildness,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_229"></A><A HREF="#fn_229"><FONT SIZE="1">230</FONT></A>
 		 and the more they see us prepared for enduring, are the more emboldened to inflict injuries, we are with difficulty induced to <i>possess our souls in patience. </i>(<a name="iv.v.ii-p28.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#019">Lu 21:19</a><a name="iv.v.ii-p28.2"></A>.) Hence those proverbs, &#8212; &#8220;<i>We </i>must howl when among wolves.&#8221; &#8220;Those who act like sheep 		will quickly be devoured by wolves.&#8221; Hence we conclude, that the ferocity of the wicked must be repressed by corresponding violence, that they may not insult us with impunity.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_230"></A><A HREF="#fn_230"><FONT SIZE="1">231</FONT></A>
 		 To such considerations Paul here opposes confidence in Divine providence. He replies, I say, that <i>the Lord is at hand, </i>whose power can overcome their audacity, and whose goodness can conquer their malice. He promises that he will aid us, provided we obey his commandment. Now, who would not rather be protected by the hand of God alone, than have all the resources of the world at his command?</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p30"></A>Here we have a most beautiful sentiment, from which we learn, in the <i>first </i>place, that ignorance of the providence of God is the cause of all impatience, and that this is the reason why we are so quickly, and on trivial accounts, thrown into confusion,  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_231"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">232</FONT></A>
 		and often, too, become disheartened because we do not recognize the fact that the Lord cares for us. On the other hand, we learn that this is the only remedy for tranquillizing our minds &#8212; when we repose unreservedly in his providential care, as knowing that we are not exposed either to the rashness of fortune, or to the caprice of the wicked,  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_232"><FONT SIZE="1">233</FONT></A>
 		but are under the regulation of God&#8217;s fatherly care. In fine, the man that is in possession of this truth, that God is present with him, has what he may rest upon with security.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p33"></A>There are, however, two ways in which <i>the Lord </i>is said to be <i>at hand</i> &#8212; either because his judgment is at hand, or because he is prepared to give help to his own people, in which sense it is made use of here; and also in <a name="iv.v.ii-p33.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#018">Ps 145:18</a><a name="iv.v.ii-p33.1"></A>, <i>The Lord is near to all that call upon him. </i>The meaning therefore <i>is,</i> &#8212; &#8220;Miserable were the 		condition of the pious, if the Lord were at a distance from them.&#8221; But as he has received them under his protection and guardianship, and defends them by his hand, which is everywhere present, let them rest upon this consideration, that they may not be intimidated by the rage of the wicked. It is well known, and matter of common occurrence, that the term <a name="iv.v.ii-p33.2"></A><i>solicitudo</i> (carefulness) is employed to denote that anxiety which proceeds 		from distrust of Divine power or help.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v.ii-p34"></A><a name="iv.v.ii-p34.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p35"></A><b>6</b> <i>But in all things</i> It is the singular number that is made use of by Paul, but is the neuter gender; the expression, therefore, is equivalent to <a name="iv.v.ii-p35.1"></A><i>omni negotio</i><i>, (in every 		matter,</i>) for (<i>prayer</i>) and (<i>supplication</i>) are feminine nouns. In these words he exhorts the Philippians, as David does all the pious in <a name="iv.v.ii-p35.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#022">Ps 55:22</a><a name="iv.v.ii-p35.2"></A>, and Peter also in <a name="iv.v.ii-p35.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#007">1Pe 5:7</a><a name="iv.v.ii-p35.3"></A>, to <i>cast all their care upon the Lord. </i>For we are not made of iron,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_233"></A><A HREF="#fn_233"><FONT SIZE="1">234</FONT></A>
 		 so as not to be shaken by temptations. But this is our consolation, this is our solace &#8212; to deposit, or (to speak with greater propriety) to disburden in the bosom of God everything that harasses us. Confidence, it is true, brings tranquillity to our minds, but it is only in the event of our exercising ourselves in prayers. Whenever, therefore, we are assailed by any temptation, let us betake ourselves forthwith to prayer, as to a sacred asylum.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_234"><FONT SIZE="1">235</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p38"></A>The term <i>requests</i> he employs here to denote desires or wishes.

 		 full of complaints or of murmurings, as though they had just ground for accusing him, while others cannot brook delay, if he does not immediately gratify their desires, Paul on this account conjoins thanksgiving with prayers. It is as though he had said, that those things which are necessary for us ought to be desired by us from the Lord in such a way, that we, nevertheless, subject our affections to his good pleasure, and give thanks while presenting petitions. 		And, unquestionably, gratitude   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_236"></A><A HREF="#fn_236"><FONT SIZE="1">237</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p44"></A>It is on good ground that he calls it the <i>peace of God, </i>inasmuch as it does not depend on the present aspect of things,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">238</FONT></A>
 		 and does not bend itself to the various shiftings of the world,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_238"><FONT SIZE="1">239</FONT></A>
 		 but is founded on the firm and immutable word of God. It is on good grounds, also, that he speaks of it as <i>surpassing all understanding</i> or <i>perception, </i>for nothing is more foreign to the human mind, than in the depth of despair to exercise, nevertheless, a feeling of hope, in the depth of poverty to see <i>opulence, </i>and in the depth of weakness to keep from giving way, and, in fine, to promise ourselves that nothing will be wanting to us when we are left destitute of all things; and all this in the grace of God alone, which is not itself known otherwise than through the word, and the inward earnest of the Spirit.</p>

Accordingly he declares, that he had been gratified by their liberality in such a way that he could at the same time endure want with patience. <i>Want </i>refers here to disposition, for that man can never be poor in mind, who is satisfied with the lot which has been assigned to him by God.</p>

 		 Prosperity is wont to puff up the mind beyond measure, and adversity, on the other hand, to depress.

Let all who wish to be Christ&#8217;s disciples exercise themselves in acquiring this knowledge which was possessed by Paul, but in 		the mean time let them accustom themselves to the endurance of poverty in such a manner that it will not be grievous and burdensome to them when they come to be deprived of their riches.</p>

We must also, after Paul&#8217;s example, take heed lest the pious, on seeing us too much inclined to receive from others, should on good grounds reckon us to be insatiable. <i>You also know, </i>says he. <i>&#8220;I </i>do not require to call in other witnesses, for ye yourselves also know.&#8221; For it frequently happens, that when one thinks that others are deficient in duty, he 		is the more liberal in giving assistance.

<p><a name="iv.v.iv-p35"></A><b>18</b> <i>I have received all things, and abound</i> He declares in more explicit terms, that he has what is sufficient, and honors their liberality with a remarkable testimony, by saying, that he <i>has been filled. </i>It was undoubtedly a 		moderate sum that they had sent, but he says, that by means of that moderate sum he is filled to satiety. It is, however, a more distinguished commendation that he bestows upon the gift in what follows, when he calls it a <i>sacrifice acceptable, and presented as the odour of a good fragrance</i> For what better thing can be desired than that our acts of kindness should be sacred 		offerings, which God receives from our hands, and takes pleasure in their sweet odour? For the same reason Christ says, <i>Whatsoever ye shall have done unto one of the least of these, ye have done it unto me.</i></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iv-p36"></A>The similitude of sacrifices, however, adds much emphasis, by which we are taught, that the exercise of love which God enjoins upon us, is not merely a benefit conferred upon man, but is also a spiritual and sacred service which is performed to God, as we read in the Epistle to the Hebrews, that he is well pleased with such sacrifices. (<a name="iv.v.iv-p36.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016">Heb 13:16</a><a name="iv.v.iv-p36.1"></A>.) 		Alas for our indolence!  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_254"></A><A HREF="#fn_254"><FONT SIZE="1">255</FONT></A>
 		&#8212; which appears in this, that while God invites us with so much kindness to the honor of priesthood, and even puts sacrifices in our hands, we nevertheless do not sacrifice to him, and those things which were set apart for sacred oblations we not only lay out for profane uses, but squander them wickedly upon the most polluted contaminations.  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_255"></A><A HREF="#fn_255"><FONT SIZE="1">256</FONT></A>
 		For the altars, on which sacrifices from our resources ought to be presented, are the poor, and the servants of Christ. To the neglect of these some squander their resources on every kind of luxury, others upon the palate, others upon immodest attire, others upon magnificent dwellings.  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_256"></A><A HREF="#fn_256"><FONT SIZE="1">257</FONT></A>

 		 While I do not reject this reading, I approve more of the other. He expressly makes mention of God as <i>his, </i>because he owns and acknowledges as done to himself whatever kindness is shewn to his servants. They had therefore been truly sowing in the Lord&#8217;s field, from which a sure and abundant harvest might be expected. Nor does he promise them merely a reward in the future life, but even in 		respect of the necessities of the present life: <i>&#8220;</i>Do not think that you have impoverished yourselves; God, whom I serve, will abundantly furnish you with everything necessary for you.&#8221; The phrase, <i>in glory, </i>ought to be taken in place of the adverb <i>gloriously, </i>as meaning <i>magnificently, </i>or <i>splendidly. </i>He adds, however, <i>by Christ, </i>in whose name everything that we do is acceptable to God.</p>

<p><a name="iv.v.iv-p44"></A><b>20</b> <i>Now to our God and Father</i> This may be taken as a general thanksgiving, by which he closes the epistle; or it may be viewed as bearing more particularly upon the last clause in reference to the liberality shewn to Paul.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_258"><FONT SIZE="1">259</FONT></A>
 		 For in respect of the assistance which the Philippians had afforded him, it became him to reckon himself indebted to them for it in such a manner as to acknowledge, that this aid had been afforded to them by the mercy of God.</p>

 		 afterwards all the saints in general, that is, the whole Church at Rome, but chiefly those of the household of Nero &#8212; a thing well deserving to be noticed; for it is no common evidence of divine mercy, that the gospel had made its way into that sink of all crimes and iniquities. It is also the more to be admired, in proportion as it is a rare thing for holiness to reign in the courts of sovereigns. The conjecture formed by some, that Seneca is here referred to 		among others, has no appearance of foundation; for he never gave any evidence, even the smallest, of his being a Christian; nor did he belong to the <i>household of Caesar, </i>but was a senator, and had at one time held the office of praetor.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_260"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">261</FONT></A>
