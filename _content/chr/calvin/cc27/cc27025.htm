<p><a name="vii.i-p5"></A><b><a name="vii.i-p5.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002">Hosea. 1:2</a><a name="vii.i-p5.2"></A>, </b><i>Take to thee a wife, etc</i>., Whether the marriage of the Prophet was a real transaction or not, has been a subject much controverted by the learned. Bishop Horsley, in his Introduction to his New Translation of Hosea, defends, with his usual ability, the opinion that it 			 was a real marriage. Dr. Henderson, in his work on the Minor Prophets, takes the same view. The strongest point in favor of the opposite sentiment, that it was a kind of a parabolic representation, is the command, similar to this, which is given to the Prophet in the third chapter; and to this Calvin especially alludes. Though the latter command is similar, yet it materially differs in many circumstances; and the design of the transaction is wholly different.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p6"></A>The reason for what is commanded is given in both instances. The first marriage was to represent the defection of this people from God, because &#8220;by wantoning the land had grown wanton, that it did not follow Jehovah.&#8221; The second contract (for it was no marriage) was to set forth &#8220;the love of Jehovah towards the children of Israel.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p7"></A>There seems to be no ground for the opinion, that the first wife, Gomer, is &#8220;the woman&#8221; mentioned in the third chapter, who, having been repudiated for her incontinence, was again to be restored. The dowry which the Prophet is said to have given for her, according to the usual manner of those times, clearly shows that it was a new engagement, and not the renewal of a former union. What Dr. Henderson states in favor of what he thinks to have 			 been a reunion, seems to be of no force. The command, he says, is different; it is not &#8220;take,&#8221; but &#8220;love.&#8221; The evident reason for this difference is, that it was no marriage but a contract for marriage, as the sequel evidently proves: he &#8220;bought&#8221; her, she was to &#8220;abide&#8221; for him, she was not to be for another, and he promised to be for her.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p8"></A>The evident design of the first marriage, whether real or not, was to represent the state of the people at that time, in their idolatry, and the ruinous consequences of that idolatry. The evident design of what is recorded in the third chapter, as Calvin states at large, was to set forth the dealings of God with the people during their exile. As the latter transaction bears much the appearance of a parable, we may reasonably conclude that the 			 first was of the same character.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p9"></A>It may be added, that <i>Marckius,</i> who wrote largely and learnedly on the Minor Prophets, maintains that &#8220;children of wantonness,&#8221; or of fornications, do not mean spurius children, but those addicted to wantonness; as in the case of the mother, who was not called a woman of fornications because of her birth, but of her lewd conduct. The children, then, were thus called prospectively; that is, with regard to what they would be. Now, if this 			 be true as to the children, the question may be asked, Was not this also the case with the mother; that is, was she not called prospectively &#8220;a wife of fornications?&#8221; This would certainly be a corrector emblem of the state of the people, who had become idolaters, after God as it were married them, or entered into covenant with them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p10"></A><b><a name="vii.i-p10.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#006">Hosea. 1:6</a><a name="vii.i-p10.2"></A>, </b><i>I will take them away,</i> In confirmation of the note on this place, the following texts are adduced: &#8212; <a name="vii.i-p10.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#026">Gen. 18:26</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#017">Gen. 50:17</a><a name="vii.i-p10.3"></A>; <a name="vii.i-p10.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#021">Ex 23:21</a><a name="vii.i-p10.4"></A>; <a name="vii.i-p10.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#019">Nu 14:19</a><a name="vii.i-p10.5"></A>; <a name="vii.i-p10.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#019">Jos 24:19</a><a name="vii.i-p10.6"></A>; <a name="vii.i-p10.7"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#018">Ps. 25:18</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#008">Ps. 99:8</a><a name="vii.i-p10.7"></A>; 			 <a name="vii.i-p10.8"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#009">Isa 2:9</a><a name="vii.i-p10.8"></A>. These are <i>all</i> the instances in which the verb <a name="vii.i-p10.9"></A>&#1504;&#1513;&#1488; is followed by <a name="vii.i-p10.10"></A>&#1500;, without an objective case: and it means invariably 			 to forgive, and not to take away. And the last text in Isaiah has nearly the very words of this passage, <a name="vii.i-p10.11"></A>&#1493;&#1500;&#1488;-&#1514;&#1513;&#1488; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;, &#8220;and forgive them not.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p11"></A><b><a name="vii.i-p11.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#011">Hosea. 2:11</a><a name="vii.i-p11.2"></A></b>,<i> Her new moon,</i> <i>etc</i>., It is the character of poetry to use the singular number in a collective sense; her new moon, not her new moons. Several instances of this we meet with in this chapter: 			 &#8220;her vine and her fig-tree&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;her ear-ring and her chain&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;the bird of heaven and the reptile of the earth,&#8221; &#8212; all these, though in the singular number, are to be understood as including multiplicity. Calvin retains this poetic character of the original. It would have been better if it had been retained in all translations.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p12"></A><b><a name="vii.i-p12.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004">Hosea 3:4</a><a name="vii.i-p12.2"></A>, </b><i>Without a statue</i>, <i>etc</i>., &#8220;If I may offer a conjecture concerning the difference between these idolatrous statues and teraphim, I would say, that the statues were of large dimensions, set up in public, as objects of popular adoration, [as 			 crucifixes, etc., in Popish countries:] the teraphim were of a smaller size, and for different purposes; kept in the most secret recesses of the temples or consecrated chapels, for magical rites, and rarely, if ever, exposed to public view.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p13"></A>&#8220;Thus, since it appears that both the statue and the teraphim of Hosea were impliments of idolatry, no doubt can remain, that the <i>ephod,</i> which is mentioned between the two, is to be understood of the idolatrous ephod, not that which belonged to the holy vestments of the high priest. As it is put between the statue and the teraphim, it may seem, that it may be connected with either: 			 connected with the statue, it will denote the robe with which the idol was clothed: connected with the teraphim, the ephod of the priest of the teraphim. And in this connection (to which, indeed, the structure of the sentence in the original seems to point in preference) I would choose to take it. For thus we shall have idolatry described by the three principal features in its external appearance, &#8212; the statue, the public object of popular adoration, &#8212; the teraphim, the images of the more 			 secret rites of incantation, &#8212; and the sorcerer, or heirophant, conduction the ceremonies, and propounding to the consultors of the oracle the answers he pretended to receive, represented by the ephod, the most remarkable of his robes of office.&#8221; &#8212; <a name="vii.i-p13.1"></A>Bishop Horsely</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p14"></A><b><a name="vii.i-p14.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008">Hosea 4:8</a><a name="vii.i-p14.2"></A>, </b><i>To iniquity they lift up the heart of each,</i> Probably the words are not correctly rendered according to the exposition given by Calvin. As he explains <i>As to iniquity,</i> would be perhaps the best rendering; for his comment 			 is, &#8220;that the priests lifted up the soul of each by relieving their consciences by soothing words of flattery.&#8221; However true this may have been, yet the meaning of this sentence is, I believe, what I have stated in a note. The rendering I have given removes the anomalies of persons which Calvin notices. The persons who did eat or feed on the sin of the people were evidently the priests, and they were those who raised or lifted up the heart or mind of the people. The affix, <i>their,</i> to iniquity, refers to the priests, and the affix, <i>his</i>, to the heart or mind, refers to the people, and ought to be rendered, <i>their,</i> in our language. Some copies have <i>their</i> appended to the word, <a name="vii.i-p14.3"></A>&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1501;; but this, I have no doubt, has been an attempt, as in other instances, to correct what appeared to be an anomaly. <i>Dr. Henderson</i> renders the line, &#8220;And long for their iniquity,&#8221; and adds in a note, that <a name="vii.i-p14.4"></A>&#1504;&#1513;&#1488; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;,<i> to lift up the animal soul</i> for anything, means to <i>lust after it,</i> long or have a strong desire for it. It has no doubt this meaning; but it means also, to raise up, or guide, or direct the soul, including the mind, the attention, and affections, to an object. The phrase is included, with all its accompaniments, the verb, an objective case, and the proposition <a name="vii.i-p14.5"></A>&#1488;&#1500; or <a name="vii.i-p14.6"></A>&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;, in the following sentence, <a name="vii.i-p14.7"></A>&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1488; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, &#8216;To thee, Jehovah, my soul I lift up,&#8217; <a name="vii.i-p14.8"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001">Ps 25:1</a><a name="vii.i-p14.8"></A>. See <a name="vii.i-p14.9"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#004">Ps 86:4</a><a name="vii.i-p14.9"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p15"></A><b><a name="vii.i-p15.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018">Hosea 4:18</a><a name="vii.i-p15.2"></A>, </b><i>Putrid is become their drink,</i> <i>Newcome</i> reads, &#8220;He is gone after their wine,&#8221; that is, of idols. But this rendering cannot be admitted, as it gives a sense to <a name="vii.i-p15.3"></A>&#1505;&#1512; which it nowhere has. <i>Horsley</i> renders thus, &#8212; &#8220;Their strong drink is vapid;&#8221; and has this note, &#8212; The allusion is to libations made with wine grown dead or turning sour. The image represents the want of all spirit of piety in their acts of worship, and the unacceptableness of such worship before God: which is alleged as a reason for the determination expressed in the preceding clause, to give 			 Ephraim up to his own ways. &#8220;Leave him to himself,&#8221; says God to the Prophet, &#8220;his pretended devotions are all false and hypocritical, I desire none of them.&#8221; <i>Henderson&#8217;s </i>rendering is new, but seems unsuitable to the text, &#8212; &#8220;When their carousal is over, they indulge in lewdness.&#8221; What appears to comport best with the words and with the context, is what is given by <i>Dathius,</i> &#8220;<a name="vii.i-p15.4"></A>compotationes eos seduxerunt,&#8221; &#8212; drinkings have seduced them. He takes <a name="vii.i-p15.5"></A>&#1505;&#1512; in a causative sense. Then the literal version of <a name="vii.i-p15.6"></A>&#1505;&#1512; &#1505;&#1489;&#1488;&#1501; would be, &#8220;Turned <i>them</i> aside, or seduced <i>them,</i> has their strong drink.&#8221; Drunkenness was ascribed to them in verse 11. If this be the meaning, then we have in this verse three of the prevailing sins of the people &#8212; drunkenness &#8212; fornication, that is idolatry &#8212; and bribery.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p16"></A>With regard to the remaining portion of the verse, both <i>Newcome</i> and <i>Henderson</i> have taken such liberties in clipping and in changing the order of the words, that their versions are wholly inadmissible. Where there is a meaning, and a striking one too, this liberty is by no means to be allowed. Horsley&#8217;s version substantially agrees with that of Calvin; and it is this, &#8220;Given up to lasciviousness, greedy of gain, (O shame!) are her 			 great men.&#8221; The parethetic expression, &#8220;O shame!&#8221; had been previously suggested by <i>Drusius.</i> &#8220;For a long time,&#8221; says the Bishop, &#8220;I thought myself original and single in this way of rendering: but I have the satisfaction to find, that the learned Drusius was before me in it. He renders thus,&#8217; &#8212; <a name="vii.i-p16.1"></A>Scortando scortati sunt, amant date (O dedecus) protedctores ejus.&#8217;&#8221; This is certainly a very literal rendering of the original, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="vii.i-p17"></A><a name="vii.i-p17.1"></A> &#1492;&#1494;&#1504;&#1492; &#1492;&#1494;&#1504;&#1493;<br> 			 <a name="vii.i-p17.3"></A>&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1493; &#1492;&#1489;&#1493; &#1511;&#1500;&#1494;&#1503; &#1502;&#1490;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;</p>  		  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent35"><a name="vii.i-p18"></A>Wantoning they have become wanton, <br> 			 &#8216;Bring ye,&#8217; (O shame!) do her protectors love.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p19"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p20"></A><b><a name="vii.i-p20.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001">Hosea 5:1</a><a name="vii.i-p20.2"></A>, </b><i>A net expanded over Tabor,</i> Striking are the words of <i>Bishop Horsley</i> in connection with this passage, &#8212; &#8220;The toils and nets are whatever, in the external form of idolatry, was calculated to captivate the minds of men; 			 magnificent temples, stately altars, images richly adorned, the gaiety of festivals, the pomp, and in many instances, even the horror of public rites.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p21"></A><b><a name="vii.i-p21.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#005">Hosea 6:5</a><a name="vii.i-p21.2"></A>, </b><i>Thy judgments, etc.,</i> <i>Henderson</i> thinks that judgments here are to be viewed in the sense of punishments, and that &#8220;thy judgments&#8221; mean those alluded to and deserved by Ephraim. That this mode of speaking is not unusual 			 in Hebrew, is no doubt true. But the word here used, commonly rendered judgments, is one of very wide meaning. It signifies not only the sentence pronounced on the criminal, but also the sentence pronounced by God as to what is right or wrong. The latter is very frequently its meaning. Moses speaks of statutes and judgments, <a name="vii.i-p21.3"></A>&#1502;&#1513;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, which the Israelites were to &#8220;do,&#8221; or observe and keep, 			 (<a name="vii.i-p21.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#014">De 4:14</a><a name="vii.i-p21.4"></A>.) The Psalmist prays God to teach him his judgments, (<a name="vii.i-p21.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#108">Ps 119:108</a><a name="vii.i-p21.5"></A>.) Hence precepts, as Horsley renders it, suitably express the meaning. Then &#8220;thy&#8221; means given to thee, revealed and communicated to thee. The expression, &#8220;thy judgments,&#8221; admits then no 			 doubt of either of these two meanings. The question is, which of the two is the most suitable to the rest of the sentence, and to the context? To compare inflicted judgments to light going forth, appears not certainly very appropriate; but when the clear teaching of God&#8217;s word as to what is right, and just, and equitable, is compared to out-spreading light, there is a striking suitableness. And then the context seems to favor this view.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p22"></A><b><a name="vii.i-p22.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#009">Hosea 6:9</a><a name="vii.i-p22.2"></A>, </b><i>By consent,</i> <i>etc</i>., <i>Newcome, Horsley,</i> and others, render the line thus, &#8220;A company of priests murder <i>in </i>the way to 			 Shechem,&#8221; taking <a name="vii.i-p22.3"></A>&#1513;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, a shoulder, taken figuratively for consent, as the name of a place. But by this rendering they change the order of the words: <a name="vii.i-p22.4"></A>&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;, the way, is before the verb to murder, and cannot be construed &#8220;in the way to Shechem.&#8221; Besides, the following line confirms the 			 rendering of Calvin; for what they are said to do is <a name="vii.i-p22.5"></A>&#1494;&#1502;&#1492;, a device, a conceived wickedness, or a concerted scheme, which seems to imply a consent.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p23"></A><b><a name="vii.i-p23.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011">Hosea 6:11</a><a name="vii.i-p23.2"></A>, </b><i>Judah also did set a plant for thee</i>  There is much difference in the meaning attached to this line. The foregoing is certainly its most literal rendering, except that for &#8220;plant&#8221; some would substitute &#8220;harvest:&#8221; but the word means both. In all other versions there is 			 something that seems forced. Some then disjoin the next line from this, and connect it with the first verse of the following chapter, and mainly because they cannot see its meaning as connected with this. Now it appears to me, that by this arrangement a confusion is introduced. It must be borne in mind that this section commences in verse 4, in which both Ephraim and Judah are mentioned: but, in the next chapter, Israel or Ephraim is alone spoken of throughout. Hence, to begin the next chapter 			 by introducing Judah, which is evidently meant by &#8220;my people,&#8221; while the whole chapter refers only to Ephraim, is certainly not to produce order, but rather disorder. The connection of the line with the preceding one is, in my view, made sufficiently clear by Calvin, &#8212; that while God was restoring, or endeavoring to restore, the captivity, the dispersed state of his people, (for many of them were taken captives by the neighboring nations long before their final captivity,) &#8212; while God was doing 			 this, Judah was engaged in setting the plant of idolatry in the land; and he is said to do this &#8220;for thee,&#8221; that is, for Ephraim, to further as it were, and assist Ephraim in his idolatry.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p24"></A>The Prophet is supposed to allude to what is recorded in <a name="vii.i-p24.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#000">2Ch 28</a><a name="vii.i-p24.1"></A>. And there we see Jewish captives restored, and Ahaz, the king of Judah, was at the same time introducing idolatry into the land: he was making, as it were, a large plantation; for he made &#8220;molten images,&#8221; and &#8220;sacrificed to the gods of Damascus.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p25"></A><b><a name="vii.i-p25.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#008">Hosea 9:8</a><a name="vii.i-p25.2"></A>, </b><i>The watchmen of Ephraim, etc.</i> The objection to this, because Ephraim is not in construction in the original with watchman, is not valid; for the latter word is a participle, and used as a personal noun, as is often the case in Hebrew. Literally, it is, &#8220;He who watcheth 			 Ephraim.&#8221; The rendering of Henderson is far-fetched, and irrelevant, as there is nothing in the context which justifies it. It is this, &#8212; &#8220;Ephraim expecteth help from my God.&#8221; To translate <a name="vii.i-p25.3"></A>&#1510;&#1494;&#1508;&#1492;, &#8220;expecteth help,&#8221; is without any example. The references, <a name="vii.i-p25.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003">Ps. 5:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#017">Lam. 4:17</a><a name="vii.i-p25.4"></A>, do not bear out the meaning. Besides, the common usage in Hebrew is, when a participle is employed as a verb to express the present time, the auxiliary verb being understood, that it follows the nominative case, and does not precede it as here. It is quite clear that the &#8220;watchman&#8221; and &#8220;the Prophet&#8221; is the same, and that he is described &#8220;as a snare of the fowler in all his ways.&#8221; The only difficulty is in the words, <a name="vii.i-p25.5"></A>&#1506;&#1503;-&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, &#8220;with my God.&#8221; If not construed with Prophet, as I have proposed in my note, it may be appended to the first line, and <a name="vii.i-p25.6"></A>&#1506;&#1501; may be rendered &#8220;before,&#8221; or, &#8220;in the presence of,&#8221; as in <a name="vii.i-p25.7"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#021">1Sa 2:21</a><a name="vii.i-p25.7"></A>, where it 			 is said that Samuel grew <a name="vii.i-p25.8"></A>&#1506;&#1501;-&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, &#8220;before Jehovah.&#8221; <i>Grotius</i> suggests that <a name="vii.i-p25.9"></A>&#1506;&#1501; here may be taken for people; and so it may, for the punctuists alone have made it especially a preposition. Then it would be, &#8220;the people of my God,&#8221; a 			 designation of Ephraim according to God&#8217;s adoption and their own profession, notwithstanding their idolatry. The meaning still would be nearly the same, for the false prophet, as well as the people, professed God&#8217;s name, and claimed to be a Prophet before God: and by this means especially were the people deluded. Satan is never so dangerous as when he pretends to be an angel of light &#8212; a servant of God, and an advocate of idolatry &#8212; a Prophet in the presence of God, and a fowler to catch men, 			 and to draw them into superstition.</p>

<p><a name="vii.i-p28"></A>By Judgment Calvin means religious conduct; I take it to be the administration of justice; but <i>Dr. Henderson,</i> with <i>Grotius</i> and others, considers it to be punishment, inflicted on the people, which seems not suitable either to the comparison or to the context. <i>Newcome&#8217;s</i> explanation is, &#8220;In these times of confusion, judgment has changed its nature, and has become destructive.&#8221; The passage in 			 <a name="vii.i-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#012">Am 6:12</a><a name="vii.i-p28.1"></A>, seems to determine the meaning here. &#8220;<a name="vii.i-p28.2"></A>Judicium hic accipio pro impia gubernatione principum Israelis, maxim&egrave; in jure dicendo: quae judicia, cum deberent esse salutaria et grata, acerba et amara fiunt et hominibus perniciosa.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Rivetus,</i> quoted by Poole.</p>

In commenting on the Vulgate, which has this 			 version &#8212; &#8220;<a name="vii.i-p34.3"></A>Jugum autem impontur eis simul, quod non auferetur &#8212; but a yoke will be laid on them together, which shall not be taken away,&#8221; <i>Rivetus</i> says, that nothing opposes this meaning, except that the Hebrews say that <a name="vii.i-p34.4"></A>&#1506;&#1500; here does not 			 mean a yoke, but the high one, that is, God. But the same word, without the <a name="vii.i-p34.5"></A>&#1493;, which it commonly has, when it means a yoke, occurs in verse 4: and there seems to be a allusion here to what is said there; as there is in the verb <a name="vii.i-p34.6"></A>&#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; to what is expressed in verse 2. The yoke is 			 considered to be that of captivity. God called them by his prophets to himself, as it is said in the second verse; they turned away from God, yet God continued his kindness, and when they were distressed, he raised up the yoke, that is, relieved them: but now, they being bent on defection, he threatens them with subjugation to a foreign power, and withdraws every hope of relief. Taking this view, we might render the words thus, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent36"><a name="vii.i-p35"></A><i>Therefore to the yoke he will call them together; <br> 			 He will not raise </i>it<i> up;</i></p>

<p><a name="vii.i-p38"></A>Not only is this a literal rendering, but it fits in remarkably with the following as well as with the previous context. The exclamation which follows naturally flows from this denunciation of judgment. The version of Newcome is somewhat like this, but not so literal nor so suitable to the context, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent36"><a name="vii.i-p39"></A><i>And </i>though<i> they call on him together because of the yoke, <br> 			 he will not raise </i>it.</p>

It 			 is said that Jehovah &#8220;will roar as a lion.&#8221; This roaring will cause trembling, &#8212; to whom? Most say, to the children of Israel; but <i>Calvin</i> says, to their enemies. But in order to avoid the evident incongruity of applying trembling to the Israelites, the meaning of hastening has been given to the verb <a name="vii.i-p41.3"></A>&#1495;&#1512;&#1491;, which it is said to have only here 			 and in <a name="vii.i-p41.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#013">2Ki 4:13</a><a name="vii.i-p41.4"></A>, its general import being that of trembling or shaking with fear.

The Israelites were not thus designated, but their enemies. But no doubt the last clause has occasioned this mistake, which, according to our version, is, &#8220;I will place them in their houses;&#8221; which may be rendered, &#8220;I will cause them to sit still on (that is, the top of 			 roof of) their houses:&#8221; for it is not <i>in,</i> but <i>on,</i> <a name="vii.i-p41.8"></A>&#1506;&#1500;. The flat roofs of the east were places to which people in fear would likely betake themselves.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p42"></A><i>Bishop Horsley</i> has here a beautiful disquisition on the progress of the Gospel; he takes roaring for preaching, a singular notion. &#8220;The roaring,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is unquestionably the sound of the Gospel. Jehovah himself shall roar: the should shall begin to be uttered by the voice of the incarnate God himself. The first effect shall be, that children shall come fluttering from the west, a new race of children, converts of the Gentiles, 			 chiefly from the western quarters of the world; &#8212; afterwards the natural Israel shall hurry from all the regions of their dispersion, and be settled in their own dwellings,&#8221; etc., etc. Though all this is very fine, it has nothing to do with this passage. Speaking of this roaring being applied to the preaching of the Gospel, <i>Calvin</i> says, &#8220;This and the like are refinements of which I think the Prophet never thought.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p43"></A><b><a name="vii.i-p43.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#012">Hosea 11:12</a><a name="vii.i-p43.2"></A>, </b><i>But Judah as yet rules with his God, etc.</i> Notwithstanding what modern critics have said on this verse, the rendering of <i>Calvin,</i> which as to the first line is adopted by <i>Horsley,</i> seems to most natural, and the most literal. <i>Newcome</i> mangles the whole text, assisted by the Septuagint, the Syriac, and Arabic versions, and the Vulgate. <i>Henderson,</i> following <i>Dathius, Boothroyd,</i> and others, affixes a new idea to <a name="vii.i-p43.3"></A>&#1512;&#1491;, supported, as they say, by the following texts: <a name="vii.i-p43.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031">Jer. 2:31</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#040">Gen. 27:40</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#002">Ps. 55:2</a><a name="vii.i-p43.4"></A>.

Now, in none of these places is there anything <i>decisive</i> in favor of the meaning attached in the following version, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent35"><a name="vii.i-p44"></A>&#8220;And as for Judah he is still inconstant with God.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p45"></A>It is said that the word includes the ideas of being <i>unfaithful, rebelling, wandering at large.</i> Much stronger and clearer examples must be adduced before this meaning can be received. It is always suspicious when anything doubtful or far-fetched is brought forward to explain a text. The meaning of ruling with or before God, as explained by <i>Calvin</i> and by others, such as <i>Rivetus,</i> seems quite satisfactory, and obviates the 			 difficulty felt by <i>Dathius</i> and others, and which obviously induced them to seek a new interpretation.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p46"></A>With regard to the other line, <i>And together with the saints he is faithful,</i> I find no improvement, but otherwise.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p47"></A><i>Newcome&#8217;s </i>version of the whole verse is this, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent36"><a name="vii.i-p48"></A><i>&#8220;Ephraim hath compassed me about with falsehood, <br> 			 And the house of Israel and of Judah with deceit; <br> 			 </i>But<i> hereafter they shall come down a people of God, <br> 			 Even a faithful people of saints.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><a name="vii.i-p51"></A>So various become versions, when once a license is taken with the text, or with the current meaning of the words. <i>Junius</i> and <i>Tremelius</i> agree with <i>Calvin,</i> except as to time, the past tense is adopted.

<p><a name="vii.i-p61"></A><b><a name="vii.i-p61.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011">Hosea 12:11</a><a name="vii.i-p61.2"></A>, </b><i>Is there iniquity in Gilead?</i> There is considerable difficulty connected with this passage, and, indeed, with the whole of this chapter, from the eighth verse to the end. The main drift is evidently what is stated by <i>Calvin,</i> and in this most commentators agree. It was clearly the design of the Prophet, in alluding to Jacob and his history, to prove the ingratitude and to beat down the pride of Ephraim. But still, to connect the whole together in a continuous narrative, is no easy task. On this very line there is a great variety. <i>Grotius</i> reads, &#8220;<a name="vii.i-p61.3"></A>Si in Galaade idolum 			 fuit;&#8221; <i>Junius</i> and <i>Tremelius,</i> &#8220;<a name="vii.i-p61.4"></A>An in Gilhade iniquitas?&#8221; <i>Horsley,</i> &#8220;Was there idolatry in Gilead?&#8221; <i>Newcome, </i>&#8220;Verily, <i>in</i> Gilead<i> there is</i> iniquity;&#8221; and <i>Henderson,</i> &#8220;Verily, Gilead is iniquitous.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p62"></A>It appears that Gilead was at this time destroyed; for what is said in <a name="vii.i-p62.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029">2Ki 15:29</a><a name="vii.i-p62.1"></A>, was evidently previous to the time of Hosea. It is there stated that the king of Assyria had taken Gilead, with other cities, and carried the inhabitants captive to Assyria.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">79</FONT></A>
 			 The reference, then, to Gilead, must have been to its former state. Gilgal being still in the possession of Israel, its state at that time is described. This shows that <i>Grotius </i>and <i>Horsley</i> are more correct than <i>Calvin, Newcome,</i> and <i>Henderson.</i> Gilead is evidently introduced as an instance of the effects of idolatry, and the folly of Israel is exposed in continuing the same idolatry at Gilgal. That I may attempt to exhibit the whole passage from verse eighth 			 to the end, in a connected form, I submit to the reader the following version, &#8212;</p>

So the meaning may be either that given by <i>Horsley</i> or by <i>Calvin;</i> and as the latter is more consonant with this passage, and does not blend in sense, as 			 the former does, with the next clause in the verse, it ought to be preferred. But the Bishop&#8217;s note must be added, &#8212; &#8220;<i>Take away all iniquity, i.e.,</i> Take away entirely the sinful principle within us. Take away the carnal heart of the old Adam. <i>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.</i> And then, when we are thus begotten again unto holiness by thy Spirit,<i> accept the good,</i> accept as good, what, so regenerate, we shall be enabled to perform.&#8221; All this is perfectly true; but the former part is not an explanation of the text; for to <i>take away sin</i> does not mean the renewal of the heart, but the forgiveness of sin. Though they be two gracious acts which go together, they are yet wholly separate and distinct; and to confound them may lead to serious 			 mistakes.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p78"></A>The same verb is used at the beginning of the verse, <i>Take,</i> or bring <i>with you words.</i> As they were to bring words of confession and prayer, so God is solicited to <i>bring good;</i> and to bring good very suitably follows the taking away of iniquity; and then follows the gratitude that is required.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="vii.i-p68"></A> This refers to the meeting or assembling of the people in the wilderness to the tabernacle. The tabernacle was called <a name="vii.i-p68.1"></A>&#1488;&#1495;&#1500; &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512;, the tabernacle of meeting, the very word used here.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="vii.i-p77"></A> The Doctor says, that <i>Horsely</i> is wrong in his philogy in this instance, and adds, that <a name="vii.i-p77.1"></A>&#1502;&#1493;&#1499; is used adverbially. No instance is given; and it is difficult to find one. Let it be adduced, and then the philogical accurateness of this rendering shall be 				  allowed. The fact is, that in Hebrew very few words of this kind are taken adverbially: the language deals very sparingly in adverbs. &#8212; <i>Ed</i></p> 			 </P><p><HR>
