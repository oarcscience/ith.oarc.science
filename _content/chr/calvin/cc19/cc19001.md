<span id="ii-p1"></span>TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE

<span id="ii-p2"></span>volume third

<span id="ii-p3"></span>The derangement as to the order of the chapters
first occurs in this Volume. It is commonly thought that chapters 21,
24, and 27, were delivered in the time of Zedekiah; while chapters 20,
22, 23, 25, and 26, contain Prophecies delivered in the previous reign
of Jehoiakim. The early Versions and the *Targum* retain the same order
with the *Hebrew,* only there are derangements of another kind both in
the *Septuagint* and the *Arabic,* which commence at verse 14 of chapter
25, and continue to the end of chapter 51: It hence appears that the
disorder had taken place early, before the Versions were made.

<span id="ii-p4"></span>There are a few particulars to which the Editor
wishes to draw the attention of Literary Readers, some of which have
been already noticed in the Notes appended to previous Volumes, though
not perhaps so fully specified as to attract attention; and there is one
subject which belongs especially to this Volume.

<span id="ii-p5"></span>The first thing is in reference to a Hebrew
idiom; and that with regard to the pronoun relative <span
id="ii-p5.1"></span>רשא, who, which, whom. There is a peculiarity as to
the use of this which has been overlooked, as far as the writer knows,
by Grammarians. It precedes in Hebrew, as in other languages, the verb
by which it is governed; but when it is not governed in a transitive
sense, a personal pronoun follows the verb with a preposition prefixed
to it, as, for instance, in <span id="ii-p5.2"></span>[Jer
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#002)<span id="ii-p5.2"></span>,

<span id="ii-p6"></span>“To whom the word of the Lord came;”

<span id="ii-p7"></span>which is literally, “Whom the word of the Lord
came to him.” “To him” and “whom” are the same. It is an idiom, and the
same exists in *Welsh,* which in many of its peculiarities corresponds
exactly with the Hebrew. This passage, and others of a similar kind, are
literally the same in that language, “<span id="ii-p7.1"></span>Yr hwn y
daeth gair yr Arglwydd atto;” and the last word, “<span
id="ii-p7.2"></span>atto,” the preposition being prefixed to the
pronoun, and made, as it were, one word, corresponds exactly with the
Hebrew.

<span id="ii-p8"></span>We have, in <span id="ii-p8.1"></span>[Jer
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#010)<span id="ii-p8.1"></span>, these
words —

<span id="ii-p9"></span>“Which (God’s house) is called by my Name,”
literally, “which my Name is called on it;”

<span id="ii-p10"></span>which means, *“on* which my Name is called.”
The following are similar examples: —

<span id="ii-p11"></span>“Unto whom they offer incense” literally, “whom
they offer incense to them,”  
(<span id="ii-p11.2"></span>[Jer
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#012)<span id="ii-p11.2"></span>;)

<span id="ii-p12"></span>“Against whom I have pronounced;” literally,
“whom I have pronounced against them,” (<span id="ii-p12.1"></span>[Jer
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#008)<span id="ii-p12.1"></span>;)

<span id="ii-p13"></span>“Upon whose roofs they have burned incense;”
literally, “which they have burned incense on their *roofs,*” (<span
id="ii-p13.1"></span>[Jer 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013)<span
id="ii-p13.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii-p14"></span>In all these instances the *Welsh* is literally
the *Hebrew.* The last example is rather remarkable, but the *Welsh* is
exactly the same, “<span id="ii-p14.1"></span>y rhai yr arogldarthasant
ar eu pennau.” The verb, also, is similar, derived from the noun which
means incense, “they have incensed;” but the verb in *English* is not so
used. There is hardly a noun or a verb in *Hebrew* which the *Welsh*
cannot literally express — a peculiarity which neither *Latin* nor
*Greek* possesses, and perhaps no modern language. See also <span
id="ii-p14.2"></span>[Gen. 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#005),

[11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011)<span id="ii-p14.2"></span>.  <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0)

<span id="ii-p17"></span>But it must be especially observed, as the
point will be hereafter referred to, that when the relative pronoun is
governed by the verb in a transitive sense, without a preposition, there
is then no personal pronoun added after the verb, either affixed to it
or separately. This seems to be an invariable rule, —

<span id="ii-p18"></span>“The land that I have given for an inheritance;
<span id="ii-p18.1"></span>יתלחנה רשא” (<span id="ii-p18.2"></span>[Jer
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018)<span id="ii-p18.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii-p19"></span>“In the land that I gave; <span
id="ii-p19.1"></span>יתתנ רשא” (<span id="ii-p19.2"></span>[Jer
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#007)<span id="ii-p19.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii-p20"></span>“My law which I set before them; <span
id="ii-p20.1"></span>םהינפל יתתנ רשא”  
(<span id="ii-p20.3"></span>[Jer
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#013)<span id="ii-p20.3"></span>.)

9:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#010)<span id="ii-p21.5"></span>.

<span id="ii-p22"></span>The Second point is connected with the style of
the Hebrew prophets.

<span id="ii-p23"></span>**1.** The order in which they arrange their
ideas. — They frequently mention, first, the effect, then the cause —
first, the last act, then the previous act or acts — first, the deed or
action, then the motive or what led to the deed — first, the later
event, then the former — first, what is most evident and visible, then
what is less ostensible and hidden. In all these instances, the order is
the reverse of what is commonly found in other writers.

<span id="ii-p24"></span>“My people is foolish,” the effect; “they have
not known me,” the cause. (<span id="ii-p24.1"></span>[Jer
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#022)<span id="ii-p24.1"></span>.)
“Before me continually is grief,” the effect; “and wounds,” the cause.
(<span id="ii-p24.2"></span>[Jer
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#007)<span id="ii-p24.2"></span>.) “I
sent them not,” the last act; “neither have I commanded them,” the
preceding; “neither spake to them,” the first. (<span
id="ii-p24.3"></span>[Jer 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#014)<span
id="ii-p24.3"></span>.) “With an outstretched hand and a strong arm,”
the deed or action; “even in anger and in fury, and in great wrath,”
what led to the deed. (<span id="ii-p24.4"></span>[Jer
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#005)<span id="ii-p24.4"></span>.) “The
truth to Jacob,” the later event; “and the mercy to Abraham,” the former
event. (<span id="ii-p24.5"></span>[Mic
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#020)<span id="ii-p24.5"></span>.)
“Hast thou utterly rejected Judah?” the visible act; “hath thy soul
loathed Zion?” the hidden reason. (<span id="ii-p24.6"></span>[Jer
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#019)<span id="ii-p24.6"></span>.)

<span id="ii-p25"></span>Similar instances are found in the New
Testament. What is palpable and evident is stated first, then what leads
to it, or the source from which it comes; as when St. Paul mentions
“rioting” first, and then “drunkenness,” which leads to it; and “strife”
first, and then “envying,” from which it proceeds. (<span
id="ii-p25.1"></span>[Ro 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#013)<span
id="ii-p25.1"></span>.) In a like manner he puts “joy,” the higher and
the most manifest feeling, before “peace,” which is the source of it.
(<span id="ii-p25.2"></span>[Ro
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#013)<span id="ii-p25.2"></span>) In
<span id="ii-p25.3"></span>[Eph
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#023)<span id="ii-p25.3"></span>, the
Apostle mentions “peace, love, and faith;” the right order is reversed —
the most evident thing is first referred to. There are many passages
which can be satisfactorily explained on no other principle.

<span id="ii-p26"></span>**2.** The order in which subjects are often
treated. — When two things are referred to, the last mentioned is first
spoken of, and then the first. This is what is very commonly done.
Pollution and going after Baalim are laid to the charge of Israel in
<span id="ii-p26.1"></span>[Jer
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023)<span id="ii-p26.1"></span>. To
prove the last it is added,

<span id="ii-p27"></span>“See thy way in the valley;”

<span id="ii-p28"></span>and to bring connection as to the first, God
says,

<span id="ii-p29"></span>“Know what thou hast done.”

<span id="ii-p30"></span>In <span id="ii-p30.1"></span>[Jer
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#028)<span id="ii-p30.1"></span>, we
have these words,

<span id="ii-p31"></span>“I have spoken it, I have purposed it.”

<span id="ii-p32"></span>The next sentence applies to the last,

<span id="ii-p33"></span>“and I will not repent,”

<span id="ii-p34"></span>and the following to what he had spoken,

<span id="ii-p35"></span>“Neither will I turn back from it.”

<span id="ii-p36"></span>Neighbor and brother are mentioned in <span
id="ii-p36.1"></span>[Jer 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#004)<span
id="ii-p36.1"></span>; the order is reversed in the latter clause of the
verse. Pashur and the people of Judah are addressed in <span
id="ii-p36.2"></span>[Jer 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#004)<span
id="ii-p36.2"></span>; the doom of Judah is described in the following
verse, and in the sixth the doom of Pashur. God speaks of

<span id="ii-p37"></span>“The way of life and of the way of death,”

<span id="ii-p38"></span>in <span id="ii-p38.1"></span>[Jer
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#008)<span id="ii-p38.1"></span>; in
the next verse, such as would meet with death are first referred to, and
then those to whom life would be granted. In <span
id="ii-p38.2"></span>[De 27:11-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#011)<span
id="ii-p38.2"></span>, and <span id="ii-p38.3"></span>[De
28:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001)<span id="ii-p38.3"></span>,
“blessing” and “curse” are mentioned, and then the “curse” is first
described, and afterwards the “blessing.” This mode of treating subjects
is indeed so common that it would be useless to multiply examples; and
there are not a few instances of the same kind in the New Testament.
 <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1)

<span id="ii-p46"></span>The Third subject is the construction of a
passage in this Volume, in connection with another, which will be
included in the next. — The two passages are <span
id="ii-p46.2"></span>[Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006)<span
id="ii-p46.2"></span>, and <span id="ii-p46.3"></span>[Jer
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016)<span id="ii-p46.3"></span>. The
doctrine involved is important; but our business is to ascertain the
real meaning according to the current diction of the language. These
passages are not rendered alike in our Version, nor in the same sense;
and yet it is evident from the context that the meaning of both passages
must be the same, though the words are in some measure different.
However we may differ from *Blayney,* he yet seems to have been at least
so far right, as he renders them both in the same sense. His versions
are the following: —

<span id="ii-p47"></span>“And this is the Name by which Jehovah shall
call him, Our Righteousness.”  
(<span id="ii-p47.2"></span>[Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006)<span id="ii-p47.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii-p48"></span>“And this is he whom Jehovah shall call, Our
Righteousness.”  
(<span id="ii-p48.2"></span>[Jer
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#016)<span id="ii-p48.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii-p49"></span>In a Note on the last verse, it is said, “This
is the strict grammatical translation of the words of the text.” There
is no doubt but that it may be so rendered; and here is an instance of
what has been already observed as to the relative <span
id="ii-p49.1"></span>רשא. It has often after the verb a personal pronoun
with a preposition prefixed: and as the verb <span
id="ii-p49.2"></span>ארק, whenever it means to name, has the preposition
<span id="ii-p49.3"></span>ל after it, so it has here. The relative and
the pronoun in this case always refer to the same thing or person. Since
this is the idiom of the language, it becomes evident that <span
id="ii-p49.4"></span>הל in this verse, is a masculine according to
Chaldee dialect, as *Blayney* regards it, or a misprint for <span
id="ii-p49.5"></span>ול according to three MSS.; for <span
id="ii-p49.6"></span>רשא, with which it is connected, has, <span
id="ii-p49.7"></span>הז, “this” for its antecedent; and “this” is
clearly the “king” mentioned in the previous verse.

<span id="ii-p50"></span>The matter then is so far clear as to
construction of this part of the verse; but whether “Jehovah” is the
nominative to the verb is another question; and this we shall presently
consider.

<span id="ii-p51"></span>The words in the other passage, <span
id="ii-p51.1"></span>[Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006)<span
id="ii-p51.1"></span>, are somewhat different. The word “Name” is in it;
but it has no personal pronoun with a <span id="ii-p51.2"></span>ל
prefixed, which is ever the case when <span id="ii-p51.3"></span>ארק
means to name, and when the word “name” is omitted. See <span
id="ii-p51.4"></span>[Ge 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#031)<span
id="ii-p51.4"></span>; <span id="ii-p51.5"></span>[Ge
35:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#018)<span id="ii-p51.5"></span>;
<span id="ii-p51.6"></span>[1Sa
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#028)<span id="ii-p51.6"></span>;
<span id="ii-p51.7"></span>[1Ch
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#007)<span id="ii-p51.7"></span>; <span
id="ii-p51.8"></span>[Jer 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#017)<span
id="ii-p51.8"></span>. But when “name” is connected with the verb in
this sense, the preposition <span id="ii-p51.9"></span>ל is not found.
See <span id="ii-p51.10"></span>[Gen.
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#009), [Gen.
29:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#035)<span id="ii-p51.10"></span>;
<span id="ii-p51.11"></span>[1Ch
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#009)<span id="ii-p51.11"></span>. This
accounts for the absence of the pronoun with a <span
id="ii-p51.12"></span>ל prefixed coming after the verb in this passage,
which is found in the other in which the word “name” is omitted. The
<span id="ii-p51.13"></span>רשא then here refers to the “name,” and
stands as it were in its place; and the literal rendering, if we adopt
*Blayney’s* arrangement of the words, would be as follows, —

<span id="ii-p52"></span>And this *is* His Name, which Jehovah shall
call it,  
Our Righteousness.

<span id="ii-p53"></span>Now there is a grammatical objection to this
rendering; for <span id="ii-p53.1"></span>רשא, as before mentioned, when
governed by a verb in the objective *case,* is never followed by a
personal pronoun after the verb, either postfixed or separately. But
here the <span id="ii-p53.2"></span>ו in <span
id="ii-p53.3"></span>וארקי is made a pronoun, wholly contrary to the
usage of the language in such a case as the present. The other passage
may admit of *Blayney’s* construction; but his version here is, as I
conceive, inadmissible, being ungrammatical; the verb is in the plural
number and not in the singular, with an affixed pronoun, therefore
Jehovah cannot be its nominative case.

<span id="ii-p54"></span>It may then be asked, how is the passage to be
translated? Let the reader bear in mind, that when the word “Name —
<span id="ii-p54.1"></span>םש,” is connected with <span
id="ii-p54.2"></span>ארק, there is no preposition used; and as <span
id="ii-p54.3"></span>רשא here has “Name” as its antecedent, it is not
necessary to have a pronoun with a prefixed <span id="ii-p54.4"></span>ל
after the verb; but this is necessary in the other passage, for the word
“name” is not given. Here we see a perfect consistency in the two
passages, though differently worded. Then the true version of this
passage I conceive to be the following, —

<span id="ii-p55"></span>“And this is His Name, which they shall call,  
Jehovah our Righteousness.”

<span id="ii-p56"></span>But in our language it might be rendered, “by
which they shall call *him”* The pronoun “they” refers to Judah and
Israel, at the beginning of the verse. As then “Jehovah” cannot be here
the nominative case to “call,” there is no grammatical necessity to make
it so in the other passage, though there is nothing contrary to the
usage of the language in such a construction. The other passage may be
rendered literally thus, —

<span id="ii-p57"></span>“And this is *He*, whom it shall be called on
Him,  
Jehovah our Righteousness.”

<span id="ii-p58"></span>The words in the idiom of our language may be
thus correctly expressed, “who shall be called.” But however awkward and
even unintelligible the literal rendering may be in English, yet it is
in *Welsh* both expressive and elegant. The phrase is word for word the
same, and thoroughly idiomatic, —

<span id="ii-p59"></span>“<span id="ii-p59.1"></span>Ac eve *yw’r* hwn y
gelwir arno, Jehova ein cyviawnder.”  <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2)

<span id="ii-p61"></span>We shall now refer to the early versions and
the Targum.

<span id="ii-p62"></span>In the *Septuagint,* the passage in <span
id="ii-p62.1"></span>[Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006)<span
id="ii-p62.1"></span>, is rendered substantially according to what is
done by *Blayney;* he indeed defends himself by appealing to that
version. As to the passage in <span id="ii-p62.2"></span>[Jer
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016)<span id="ii-p62.2"></span>, it
is wanting in the *Septuagint;* as supplied in the *Complutensian*
Edition, it is evidently a version of the *Vulgate,* as is the case in
other instances; and as given by *Theodoret,* it is as follows, —

<span id="ii-p63"></span>“This is He who shall be called (<span
id="ii-p63.1"></span>ὁ κληθήσεται)  
The Lord our Righteousness.”

<span id="ii-p64"></span>The *Vulgate* version is the same in both
places, —

<span id="ii-p65"></span>“And this is the Name which they shall call
him,  
Our righteous Lord.”

<span id="ii-p66"></span>The *Syriac* version is the same in both
places, —

<span id="ii-p67"></span>“And this is the Name by which they shall call
Him,  
The Lord our Righteousness.”

<span id="ii-p68"></span>The *Arabic* version is the same with the
preceding, only “righteousness” is not translated; it is “The Lord
Josedek.” It is wanting like the *Septuagint* as to the second passage.

<span id="ii-p69"></span>The paraphrase of the *Targum* is substantially
the same as to both places, —

<span id="ii-p70"></span>“And this is the Name by which they shall call
Him, Done shall be righteousness for us from the presence of the Lord in
his days.”

<span id="ii-p71"></span>It appears then from all the Early Versions,
except the *Septuagint* as to the first passage, and from the *Targum,*
that “Jehovah” is not connected with the verb to call, but with
“righteousness;” and this, as we have seen, comports with what the usage
of the language requires. There can therefore be no reasonable doubt as
to the real meaning of these two passages.

<span id="ii-p72"></span>As to the peculiar idioms of the Hebrew
language, the *Septuagint* version of Jeremiah and of the minor
prophets, is by no means so satisfactory as the *Vulgate* and the
*Syriac* versions. This is what the Editor can testify after a minute
examination.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[1](cc19001.htm#fr_0) <span id="ii-p14.3"></span>

<span id="ii-p15"></span> There is another peculiarity as to <span
id="ii-p15.1"></span>רשא which may be mentioned, that is, when connected
with a noun and rendered “whose,” in the genitive case in our language.
“Whose land the rivers have spoiled;” literally, “whom the rivers have
spoiled her land.” (<span id="ii-p15.2"></span>[Isa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002)<span id="ii-p15.2"></span>.)
“Whose merchants are princes;” literally, “who-her merchants are
princes.” (<span id="ii-p15.3"></span>[Isa
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#008)<span id="ii-p15.3"></span>.)
Here, again, the Welsh is exactly the Hebrew, and in the first of these
verses, the very order of the words is the same, — “<span
id="ii-p15.4"></span>Yr hon yr yspeiliodd yr avonydd ei thir.” “Whose
mouth speaketh vanity;” literally, “who — their mouth speaketh vanity.”
(<span id="ii-p15.5"></span>[Ps
144:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#008)<span id="ii-p15.5"></span>.) The
Welsh is literally the same, — “<span id="ii-p15.6"></span>Y rhai y
llevara en genan wagedd;” the “who” is in apposition with “their,” both
being in Hebrew the same in every case. See also <span
id="ii-p15.7"></span>[De 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#009)<span

<span id="ii-p16"></span>The following are similar instances: — “Whose
seed was in itself;” literally, which — its seed was in itself. (<span
id="ii-p16.1"></span>[Ge 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#012)<span
id="ii-p16.1"></span>.) “In the which is the fruit of a tree yielding
seed; literally, which — in it is the fruit of a tree yielding seed;”
(<span id="ii-p16.2"></span>[Ge
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#029)<span id="ii-p16.2"></span>.)
“Wherein is the breath of life;” literally, “which — in it is the breath
of life.” (<span id="ii-p16.3"></span>[Ge
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#017)<span id="ii-p16.3"></span>.) “Of
beasts that are not clean;” literally, “of the beast which — not it was
clean.” (<span id="ii-p16.4"></span>[Ge
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#008)<span id="ii-p16.4"></span>.) “That
hath statutes;” literally, “which to it are statutes.” (<span
id="ii-p16.5"></span>[De 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#008)<span
id="ii-p16.5"></span>.) See <span id="ii-p16.6"></span>[De

id="ii-p16.7"></span>[Ru 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#002)<span

<span id="fn_1"></span>[2](cc19001.htm#fr_1) <span id="ii-p38.4"></span>

<span id="ii-p39"></span> A few passages shall be referred to, and they
shall be arranged in lines that the order may be more clearly seen, —

<span id="ii-p40"></span>But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, But
ye are justified, In the name of the Lord Jesus, And by the Spirit of
our God. (<span id="ii-p40.1"></span>[1Co
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011)<span id="ii-p40.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii-p41"></span>He mentions sanctification first, and then
justification; the next line refers to justification, and the last to
sanctification.

<span id="ii-p42"></span>That if thou wilt confess with thy mouth the
Lord Jesus, And shalt believe in thine heart, etc., etc.; For with the
heart man believeth unto righteousness, And with the mouth confession is
made, etc. (<span id="ii-p42.1"></span>[Rom.
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010)<span id="ii-p42.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii-p43"></span>Confession and faith, and then faith and
confession. This inversion seems to shew their inseparable connection,
as in the former case as to sanctification and justification; and it is
to be observed that in both instances the right order is given last; but
the case is different in the following example: —

<span id="ii-p44"></span>And he gave some apostles, And some prophets,
and some evangelists, And some pastors and teachers; For the perfecting
of the saints, For the work of the ministry, For the edifying (or
building) of the body of Christ. (<span id="ii-p44.1"></span>[Eph.
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012)<span id="ii-p44.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii-p45"></span>The work of building the Church, which included
especially the laying of the foundation, belonged to the Apostles; the
ministerial work generally was performed by those called prophets and
evangelists, who were the assistants of the Apostles; but the perfecting
work, that of furthering the continual progress of the saints in a
religious life, was carried on by stationary pastors and teachers. See
similar instances in <span id="ii-p45.1"></span>[Mt
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006)<span id="ii-p45.1"></span>, and
<span id="ii-p45.2"></span>[1 Cor.
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#024),
[25](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#025)<span id="ii-p45.2"></span>.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[3](cc19001.htm#fr_2) <span id="ii-p59.2"></span>

<span id="ii-p60"></span> As to <span id="ii-p60.1"></span>רשא, I may
here state the result of a minute examination as to the Book of Psalm.
It is found there as a relative, and as an adverb, about a hundred and
seven times; about forty times as a nominative to verbs; nearly thirty
times as an adverb or conjunction, for, because, that, whom, how, whose,
etc.; in a few instances, in construction with nouns to which are
affixed pronouns in the same case, as exemplified in a previous note; in
twenty-six instances governed by verbs in the objective case, without
any pronouns affixed to the verbs; and five times, according to our
version, accompanied by pronouns when thus circumstanced. But in these
five instances our version seems to me to be incorrect, the construction
being inconsistent with what appears to be the common usage of the
language. The passages are the following, <span id="ii-p60.2"></span>[Ps
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005)<span id="ii-p60.2"></span>; <span
id="ii-p60.3"></span>[Ps 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#003)<span
id="ii-p60.3"></span>; <span id="ii-p60.4"></span>[Ps
88:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#005)<span id="ii-p60.4"></span>; <span
id="ii-p60.5"></span>[Ps 94:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012)<span
id="ii-p60.5"></span>; and <span id="ii-p60.6"></span>[Ps
107:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#002)<span id="ii-p60.6"></span>;
<span id="ii-p60.7"></span>רשא should be when in the first, how in the
second, where in the third, when in the fourth, and that in the fifth,
or how. as it is sometimes rendered in our version. In the first twelve
chapters of Deuteronomy, there are at least a hundred instances of <span
id="ii-p60.8"></span>רשא being governed in a transitive sense; and in no
case it has a corresponding pronoun after the verb, but there are
several instances of this, when governed by an intransitive verb — such
as the following, “A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without
scarceness,” literally, “A land which without scarceness thou shalt in
it eat bread.”
