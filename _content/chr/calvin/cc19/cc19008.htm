<p><a name="ix.ii-p2"></A><b>1.</b> In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ix.ii-p3"></A><b>1.</b> Principio regni Joakim filii Josiae, regis Jehudah, fuit sermo hic a Jehova, dicendo,</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ix.ii-p4"></A><b>2.</b> Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD&#8217;S house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD&#8217;S house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ix.ii-p5"></A><b>2.</b> Sic dicit Jehova, Sta in atrio templi Jehovae, et loquere ad omnes urbes Jehudah (<i>id est,</i> omnes cives urbium Jehudah) quae veniunt ad orandum in templum Jehovae hos omnes sermones quas mandavero tibi ad loquendum ad ipsos (<i>hoc est,</i> loquaris ipsis;) ne diminuas verbum.</p>

<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ii-p7"></A><a name="ix.ii-p7.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p8"></A>This chapter contains a remarkable history, to which a very useful doctrine is annexed, for Jeremiah speaks of repentance, which forms one of the main points of true religion, and he shews at the same time that the people were rejected by God, because they perversely despised all warnings, and could by no means be brought to a right mind. We shall find these two things in this chapter.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p9"></A>He says that this word came to him at the <i>beginning of the reign, of Jehoiakim, </i>of which king we have spoken in other places, where Jeremiah related other discourses delivered in his reign. We hence conclude that this book was not put together in a regular order, but that the chapters were collected, and from them 			 the volume was formed.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p10"></A>The time, however, is not here repeated in vain, for we know that the miserable derive some hope from new events. When men have been long afflicted and well-nigh have rotted in their evils, they yet think, when a change takes place, that they shall be happy, and they promise themselves vain hopes. Such was probably the confidence of the people when Jehoiakim began to reign; for they might have thought that things would be restored by him to a 			 better state. There is also another circumstance to be noticed; though their condition was nigh past hope, they yet hardened themselves against God, so that they obstinately resisted the prophets. It hence appears that the reprobate were become more and more exasperated by the scourges of God, and had never been truly and really humbled. This was the reason why Jeremiah, according to God&#8217;s command, spoke so sharply.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p11"></A>I pass by other things and come to the words, that <i>the word of Jehovah came </i>to him. He thus arrogated nothing to himself; but he testifies how necessary it was, especially among a people so refractory, that he should bring nothing of his own, but announce a truth that came from heaven. A general subject might be here handled, which is, 			 that God alone is to be heard in the Church, and also that no one ought to assume to himself the name of a prophet or teacher, except he whom the Lord has formed and appointed, and to whom he has committed his message; but these things have been treated elsewhere and often and much at large; and I do not willingly dwell long on general subjects. It is then enough to bear in mind the purpose for which Jeremiah says that the word of Jehovah came to him, even that he might secure authority to 			 himself; he does not boast of his own wisdom nor of anything human or earthly, but says only that he spoke what the Lord had commanded him.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ii-p12"></A><a name="ix.ii-p12.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p13"></A>He adds, <i>Thus saith Jehovah, Stand in the court of the house </i>(literally, but house means the Temple) <i>of Jehovah</i> It was not allowed the people to enter into the Temple; hence the Prophet was bidden to abide in the court 			 where he might be heard by all. He was, as we have seen, of the priestly order; but it would have been but of little avail to address the Levites.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">159</FONT></A>
 			  It was therefore necessary for him to go forth and to announce to the whole people the commands of God which are here recited; and he was to do this not only to the citizens of Jerusalem, but also to all the Jews; and this is expressly required, <i>speak to all the cities of Judah; </i>and then it is added, <i>who come to worship in the Temple of Jehovah</i> God seems to have designedly anticipated the presumption of those who thought that wrong was done to them, when they were so severely reproved; &#8220;What! we have left our wives and children, and have come here to worship God; we have laid aside every attention to our private advantage, and have come here, though inconveniently; we might have lived quietly 			 at home and enjoyed our blessings; we have incurred great expenses, undertaken a tedious journey, brought sacrifices, and denied ourselves as to our daily food, that God might be worshipped; and yet thou inveighest severely against us, and we hear nothing from thy mouth but terrors; is this right? Does God render such a reward to his servants?&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p15"></A>Thus then they might have contended with the Prophet; but he anticipates these objections, and allows what they might have pleaded, that they came to the Temple to offer sacrifices; but he intimates that another thing was required by God, and that they did not discharge their duties in coming to the Temple, except they faithfully obeyed God and his Law. We now see why the Prophet said, that he was sent to those who came up to Jerusalem to 			 worship God. The deed itself could not indeed have been blamed; nay, it was highly worthy of praise, that they thus frequented the worship of God; but as the Jews regarded not the end for which God had commanded sacrifices to be offered to him, and also the end for which he had instituted all these external rites, it was necessary to remove this error in which they were involved.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p16"></A>Speak, he says, <i>all the words which I have commanded thee to speak to them</i> The Prophet again confirms, that he was not the author of what he taught, but only a minister, who faithfully announced what God had committed to him; and so the people could not have objected to him by saying, that he brought forward his 			 own devices, for he repelled such a calumny. The false prophets might have also alleged similar things; but Jeremiah had certain evidences as to his calling, that the Jews, by rejecting him, condemned themselves, for their own consciences fully convicted them. But from this passage, and from many like passages, we may draw this conclusion, &#8212; that no one, however he may excel in powers of mind, or knowledge, or wisdom, or station, ought to be attended to, except he proves that he is God&#8217;s 			 minister.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p17"></A>He afterwards adds, <i>Thou shalt not diminish a word</i> Some read, &#8220;Thou shall not restrain,&#8221; which is harsh. The verb, <a name="ix.ii-p17.1"></A>&#1506;&#1512;&#1490;, <i>garo, </i>properly means to be lessened 			 and to be consumed. And Moses makes use of the same word in <a name="ix.ii-p17.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#032">De 12:32</a><a name="ix.ii-p17.2"></A>, when he says,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ix.ii-p18"></A>&#8220;Thou shalt not add, nor diminish,&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p19"></A>in reference to the Law, in which the people were to acquiesce, without corrupting it with any human devices. To diminish then was to take away something from the word.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">160</FONT></A>
 			  But we ought to consider the reason why this was said to Jeremiah; it never entered the mind of the holy man to adulterate God&#8217;s word; but God here encourages him to confidence, so that he might boldly execute his commands. To diminish then something from the word, was to soften what appeared sharp, or to suppress what might have offended, or to express indirectly or coldly what could not produce effect without being forcibly expressed. 			 There is then no doubt but that God anticipates here this evil, under which even faithful teachers in a great measure labor; for when they find the ears of men tender and delicate, they dare not vehemently to reprove, threaten, and condemn their vices. This is the reason why God added this, <i>Diminish not a word; </i>as though he had said, &#8220;Declare thou with closed eyes and with boldness 			 whatever thou hast heard from my mouth, and disregard whatever may tend to lessen thy courage.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p21"></A>We may now easily learn the use of this doctrine; the Prophet was not sent to profane men, who openly avowed their impiety, or lived in gross sins; but he was sent to the very worshippers of God, who highly regarded his external worship, and for this reason had left wives and children, came to the Temple and spared neither labor nor expense. As, then, he was sent to them, we must beware, lest we sleep in our vices and think 			 that we have done our duty to God, when we have apparently given some evidences of piety; for except we really and <i>sincerely obey </i>God, all other things are esteemed of no value by him. It then follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="ix.iii"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption21"><a name="ix.iii-p1"></A><a name="ix.iii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#003">Jeremiah 26:3</a><a name="ix.iii-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ix.iii-p2"></A><b>3.</b> If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ix.iii-p3"></A><b>3.</b> Si forte audiant et convertantur quisque a via sua mala, et poeniteat me mali quod ego cogitans ad faciendum (<i>id est,</i> cogito facere) ipsis propter (a facie, <i>ad verbum)</i> malitiam actionurn ipsorum.</p> 				  			   		    		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.iii-p5"></A><a name="ix.iii-p5.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p6"></A>In this verse God briefly shows for what end he sent his Prophet. For it would not have been sufficient for him to announce what he taught, except it was known to have been the will of God. Here then God asserts that he would not be propitious to the people, except they complied with what he required, that is, to repent. Thus he testifies that what was taught would be useful to them, because it had reference to their safety; and a truth cannot 			 be rendered more entitled to our love than when we know that it tends to promote our wellbeing. Therefore God, when he saw the people rushing headlong through blind despair into all kinds of impiety, designed to make the trial whether or not some of them were healable; as though he had said, &#8220;What are ye doing, ye miserable beings? It is not yet wholly over with you; only obey me, and the remedy for all your evils is ready at hand.&#8221; We now see what God&#8217;s design was, even that he wished to give 			 those Jews the hope of mercy who were altogether irreclaimable, so that they might not reject what he taught on hearing that it would be for their good.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p7"></A>But we may hence gather a general doctrine; that when God is especially displeased with us, it is yet an evidence of his paternal kindness when he favors us with the prophetic teaching, for that will not be without its fruit, except it be through our own fault. But at the same time we are rendered more and more inexcusable, if we reject that medicine which would certainly give us life. Let us then understand that the Prophet says here, that he 			 was sent that he might try whether the Jews would repent; for God was ready to receive them into favor.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p8"></A>By saying <a name="ix.iii-p8.1"></A>&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;,<i> auli, </i>&#8220;if peradventure,&#8221; he made use of a common mode of speaking. God indeed has perfect knowledge of all events, nor had he any doubt respecting what would take place, when the prophets had discharged 			 their duties; but what is pointed out here, and also condemned, is the obstinacy of the people; as though he had said, that it was indeed difficult to heal those who had grown putrid in their evils, yet he would try to do so. And thus God manifests his unspeakable goodness, that he does not wholly cast away men who are almost past remedy, and whose diseases seem to be unhealable. He also strengthens his Prophet; for he might from long experience have been led to think that all his labor would 			 be in vain; therefore God adds this, that he might not cease to proceed in the course of his calling; for what seemed incredible might yet take place beyond his expectation. We now see why it was said, <i>If so be that they will hear</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p9"></A>It is then added, <i>and turn, etc. </i>From the context we learn, that repentance as well as faith proceeds from the truth taught: for how is it that those alienated from God return, confess their sins, and change their character, minds, and purposes? It is the fruit of truth; not that truth in all cases is effectual, 			 but he treats here of the elect: or were they all healable, yet God shews that the use and fruit of his truth is to turn men, as it is said also by the Prophet, (<a name="ix.iii-p9.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006">Mal 4:6</a><a name="ix.iii-p9.1"></A>,) and repeated in the first chapter of Luke,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ix.iii-p10"></A>&#8220;He will turn many of the children of Israel.&#8221; (<a name="ix.iii-p10.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#006">Lu 1:6</a><a name="ix.iii-p10.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p11"></A>What follows is not without its weight, <i>every one from his evil way; </i>for God intimates that it was not enough that the whole people should ostensibly confess their sins, but that every one was required to examine himself: for when we seek God in a troop, and one follows another, it is often done with no right 			 feeling. Repentance therefore is only true and genuine, when every one comes to search his own case; for its interior and hidden seat is in the heart. This is the reason why he says, <i>If a man, </i>that is, if every one <i>turns from his evil way</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p12"></A>As to God&#8217;s<i> repentance, </i>of which mention is made, there is no need of long explanation. No change belongs to God; but when God is said to turn away his wrath, it is to be understood in a sense suitable to the comprehension of men: in the same way also we are to understand the words, that he repents. 			 (<a name="ix.iii-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#005">Ps. 85:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004">Ps. 110:4</a><a name="ix.iii-p12.1"></A>.) It is at the same time sufficiently evident what God means here, even that he is reconcilable, as soon as men truly turn to him: and thus we see that men cannot be called to repent, until God&#8217;s mercy is presented to them. Hence also it follows, that these two things, repentance and faith, are 			 connected together, and that it is absurd and an impious sacrilege to separate them; for God cannot be feared except the sinner perceives that he will be propitious to him: for as long as we are apprehensive of God&#8217;s wrath, we dread his judgment; and thus we storm against him, and must necessarily be driven headlong into the lowest abyss, hence under the Papacy they speak not only foolishly, but also coldly of repentance; for they leave souls 			 doubtful and perplexed, nay, they take away every kind of certainty. Let us then understand the reason why the Holy Spirit teaches us, that repentance cannot be rightly and profitably taught, unless it be added, that God will be propitious to miserable men whenever they turn to him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p13"></A>With regard to the word<i> I think, </i>I have already said, that God forms no contrary purposes; but this refers to those men who deserved his dreadful vengeance; it is the same as though he had said, &#8212; &#8220;Their iniquity has already ripened; I am therefore now ready to take vengeance on them: nevertheless let them 			 return to me, and they shall find me to be a Father. There is, then, no reason for them to despair, though I have already manifested tokens of my vengeance.&#8221; This is the meaning; but he repeats the reason of his wrath, On <i>account of the wickedness of their doings; </i>for we know that they were proud and obstinate; it was therefore necessary to close their mouths, otherwise they would 			 have raised a clamor, and said, that God was unjustly angry, or that he exceeded all bounds. Whatever evils then were at hand, God briefly shews that they came from themselves, that the cause was their own wickedness,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">161</FONT></A>
 			  It follows, &#8212;</p>  <a name="ix.iv"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption21"><a name="ix.iv-p1"></A><a name="ix.iv-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#004">Jeremiah 26:4-6</a><a name="ix.iv-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ix.iv-p2"></A><b>4.</b> And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ix.iv-p3"></A><b>4.</b> Dices ergo ad eos, Sic dicit Jehova, Si non audieritis me, ut ambuletis in lege mea, quam posui coram conspectu vestro,</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ix.iv-p4"></A><b>5.</b> To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending <i>them, </i>but ye have not hearkened;</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ix.iv-p5"></A><b>5.</b> Ad audiendum sermonem <i>(hoc est, </i>ut audiatis sermones) servorum meorum prophetarum, quos ego mitto ad vos, et mane surgendo et mittendo, neque tamen audistis <i>(hoc postremum lego parenthesin;)</i></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ix.iv-p6"></A><b>6.</b> Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ix.iv-p7"></A><b>6.</b> Et <i>(id est, </i>tunc) ponam domum hanc <i>(id est, </i>templum) sicuti Silo, et urbem hanc ponam maledictionem cunctis gentibus terrae.</p> 				  			   		    		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p8"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.iv-p9"></A><a name="ix.iv-p9.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p10"></A>The Prophet now briefly includes what he had been teaching, what he had been commanded to declare to the people. No doubt he spoke to them more at large; but he deemed it enough to shew in a few words what had been committed to him. And the sum of it was, that except the Jews so hearkend as to walk in God&#8217;s Law, and were submissive to the prophets, final ruin was nigh the Temple and the city. This is the meaning: but it may be useful to 			 consider every particular.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p11"></A>By these words, <i>Except ye hearken to me, to walk in my law, </i>God intimates, that he mainly requires obedience, and esteems nothing as much, according to what he says, that it is better than all sacrifices. (<a name="ix.iv-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022">1Sa 15:22</a><a name="ix.iv-p11.1"></A>.) This subject was largely treated in the seventh chapter, where he said,</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p12"></A>&#8220;Did I command your fathers when they came out of Egypt to offer sacrifices to me? this only I required, even to hear my voice.&#8221; (<a name="ix.iv-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022">Jer. 7:22</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#023">23</a><a name="ix.iv-p12.1"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p13"></A>We hence see, that the only way of living piously, justly, holily, and uprightly, is to allow ourselves to be ruled by the Lord. This is one thing. Then what follows is worthy of being noticed, <i>To walk in my law</i> God here testifies that his will is not ambiguous or doubtful, for he has prescribed what is right in 			 his law. Were God then to descend a hundred times from heaven, he would bring nothing but this message, that he has spoken what is necessary to be known, and that his Law is the most perfect wisdom. Had he said only, &#8220;Hear me,&#8221; men might have still evaded and avowed themselves ready to learn. God therefore does here silence hypocrites, and says that he required nothing else but to follow his Law. And for the same purpose he adds what follows, <i>which I have set before you: </i>for this kind of speaking intimates that the doctrine of the Law was by no means obscure or doubtful, as Moses said,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ix.iv-p14"></A>&#8220;I this day call heaven and earth to witness, that I have set life and death before your eyes.&#8221; (<a name="ix.iv-p14.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#019">De 30:19</a><a name="ix.iv-p14.1"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p15"></A>And in another place he said,</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p16"></A>&#8220;Say not, Who shall ascend above the clouds? or, Who shall descend into the abyss? or, Who shall pass beyond the sea? The word is in thy heart and in thy mouth,&#8221; (<a name="ix.iv-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#012">De 30:12-14</a><a name="ix.iv-p16.1"></A>; <a name="ix.iv-p16.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006">Ro 10:6-8</a><a name="ix.iv-p16.2"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p17"></A>as though he had said, &#8220;God has deprived you of every excuse, for there is no reason for doubting, since he has spoken so familiarly to you, and has explained everything necessary to be known.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p18"></A>And hereby is confuted the impious blasphemy of the Papists, who impudently assert that not only the Law is obscure, but also the Gospel. And Paul also loudly declares, that the Gospel is not obscure except to those who perish, and who have a veil over their hearts, being visited with judicial blindness. But as to the Law, in which there is no such plainness as in the Gospel, we see what Jeremiah affirms here, that it was set before the eyes 			 of all, that they might learn from it what pleased God, and what was just and right.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.iv-p19"></A><a name="ix.iv-p19.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p20"></A>But what follows in the next verse ought to be especially observed; for these two things are necessarily connected, &#8212; that God required nothing but obedience to his Law, &#8212; and that his will was that his prophets should be heard, &#8212; <i>To hearken, </i>he says, <i>to the 			 words of my servants, the prophets, whom I send to you, </i>(it is in the second person.) Here there seems to be some inconsistency; for if God&#8217;s Law was sufficient, why were the prophets to be heard? But these two things well agree together: the Law alone was to be attended to, and also the prophets, for they were its interpreters. For God sent not his prophets to correct the Law, to change anything in it, to add or to take away; as it was an unalterable 			 decree, not to add to it nor to diminish from it. What then was the benefit of sending the prophets? even to make more manifest the Law, and to apply it to the circumstances of the people. As then the prophets devised no new doctrine, but were faithful interpreters of the Law, God joined, not without reason, these two things together, &#8212; that his Law was to be heard and also his prophets; for the majesty of the Law derogated nothing from the authority of the prophets; and as the prophets 			 confirmed the Law, it could not have been that they took away anything from the Law.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p21"></A>Nay, this passage teaches us, that all those who repudiate the daily duty of learning, are profane men, and extinguish as far as they can the grace of the Spirit; many such fanatics among the Anabaptists have been in our time, who despised learning of every kind. They boasted that the doctrine of the Law was the Alphabet; and they also indulged in this dream, that wrong is done to the Holy Spirit when men attend to learning. 			 And some dare, in a grosser manner, to vomit forth their blasphemies; they say that Scripture is enough for us, yea, even these two things, &#8220;Fear God and love thy neighbor.&#8221; But as I have already said, we must consider how God has spoken by his Law; whether he has closed up the way, so as not to explain his will more clearly by the prophets, nor to apply to present use what would have otherwise been less effectual? or that he purposed to draw 			 continually by various channels the doctrine which flows from that fountain? But now, since God had given his own Law, and had added to the Law his prophets, every one who rejected the prophets must surely <i>ascribe </i>no authority to the Law. Even so now, they who think it not their duty at this day to seek knowledge in the school of Christ, and to avail themselves of the hearing of his word, no doubt despise 			 God in their hearts, and set no value either on the Law, or on the prophets, or on the Gospel. Remarkable then is this passage; it shews that the Lord would have his Law to be our leader and teacher, and yet he adds his own prophets.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p22"></A>He says further, <i>Whom I have sent to you, rising early and sending</i> Here he upbraids the Jews with their slowness and insensibility; for he roused them early, and that not once but often, and yet he spent his labor in vain. <i>Rising early, </i>when applied to God, means that he called these men in due time, as though he had said, that it was not his fault that the Jews had departed from the right way of safety, for he had been sedulously careful of their well-being, and had in due time warned them. We hence see how the Prophet condemned their tardiness and indifference, and then their hardness, by saying, <i>and sending</i>; for this intimates a repetition or assiduity. He had said before, &#8220;whom I sent to you, rising early;&#8221; now, when he says <i>and sending, </i>he means that he had not sent one prophet, or many at one time, but one after another continually, and that yet it had been without any benefit. The end of the verse I read in a 			 parenthesis, (<i>but ye have not hearkened.) </i>Indeed what follows stands connected with the previous verses.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">162</FONT></A>

<p><a name="ix.vi-p2"></A>We could not yesterday finish the words of the Prophet, as time did not allow us to do so. We said that the Prophet had denounced God&#8217;s vengeance on the people in such a manner, that he softened that severity by some comfort, lest despair should have rendered more obstinate those whom he wished to turn into obedience; we said also, that the ministers of the word cannot otherwise speak rightly or profitably of repentance, except they connect 			 with it the promise of God&#8217;s mercy. But as the Prophet had to do with refractory men and despisers of God, it behoved him to declare what at length he subjoins, even that the destruction of the Temple and city was nigh at band, except they repented.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.vi-p3"></A>And he says that<i> that house would become like Shiloh, </i>in order that by this example he might touch their hearts; for the ark of God had been long at Shiloh, and that place might have been deemed venerable for being ancient. Jerusalem was indeed renowned, but Shiloh was in time before it. This place was now 			 forsaken; nay, it presented a sad and a degraded spectacle. He thus set before their eyes an example of God&#8217;s vengeance, such as awaited them. We have seen the same reference in <a name="ix.vi-p3.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012">Jer 7:12</a><a name="ix.vi-p3.1"></A>, where the Prophet says,</p>

<p><a name="ix.vi-p5"></A>etc.; but he now speaks more briefly, for he no doubt repeated often the same things.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.vi-p6"></A>Then he adds, I <i>will make this city a curse, or execration, to all the nations of the earth</i> It was still more intolerable to the Jews to hear what Jeremiah says here, &#8212; that so great a city, the sanctuary and the royal throne of God, would become a curse to heathen nations; and yet as God had commanded him to say 			 this, he boldly performed his duty.

<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.vii-p7"></A><a name="ix.vii-p7.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.vii-p8"></A>Here the Prophet recites what happened to him, after he had declared God&#8217;s message, and faithfully warned the people by adding threatenings, as God had commanded him. He says first that he was <i>heard; </i>which is not to be deemed as commendatory, as though the priests and prophets patiently heard what he taught; for 			 there was no teachable spirit in them, nor did they come prepared to learn, but they had long indulged themselves in perverseness, so that Jeremiah was become to them an avowed enemy; and they also audaciously opposed all his threatenings. But though they were not ashamed to reject what the Prophet said, they yet observed a certain form, as it is usual with hypocrites, for they are more exact than necessary, as they say, in what is formal, but what is really important they neglect. We may hence 			 observe, that the priests and prophets deserved no praise, because they restrained themselves, as though they deferred their judgment until the cause was known, but as the whole people were present, they for a time shewed themselves moderate; it was yet a reigned moderation, for their hearts were full of impiety and contempt of God, as it became really manifest.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.vii-p9"></A>But it must be observed that he says that the <i>priests </i>and <i>prophets hearkened</i> As to the priests, it is no wonder that he calls them so, though they were in every way wicked, for it was an hereditary honor. But it is strange 			 that he mentions the prophets. At the same time we must know, that Jeremiah thus calls those who boasted that they were sent from above. In the twenty-third chapter he at large reproves them; and in many other places he condemns their impudence in falsely assuming the authority of God. He then allowed them an honorable title, but esteemed it as nothing; as we may do at this day, who without harm may call by way of ridicule those prelates, bishops, or pastors, who under the Papacy seek to be 			 deemed so, provided we at the same time strip them of their masks. But these lay hold on the title, and thus seek to suppress the truth of God, as though to be called a bishop were of more weight than if an angel was to come down from heaven. And yet were an angel to <i>descend </i>from heaven, he ought to be counted by us as a devil, if he brought forward such filthy and execrable blasphemies, as we see the 			 world is at this day polluted with by these unprincipled men. This passage then, and the like, ought to be borne in mind, for they shew that titles are not sufficient, except those who bear them really shew that they are such as their calling imports. Thus, then, Jeremiah was called a Prophet, and also those impostors were called prophets whose only religion it was to corrupt and pervert the doctrine of the Law, but they were so called with regard to the people. It is in the meantime 			 necessary, wisely to distinguish between prophets or teachers, as also the Apostle reminds us, we ought to inquire whether their spirit is from God or not.

Thus he briefly exposed 			 the injustice of those by whom he was condemned; for they had no regard to what was right, as we shall presently see. But as they had brought with them a preconceived hatred, so they vomited out what they could no longer contain. It afterwards follows, &#8212;</p>  <a name="ix.viii"></A>

<p><a name="ix.viii-p6"></A>Here is added the cause of Jeremiah&#8217;s condemnation, that he had dared to threaten with so much severity the holy city and the Temple. They did not inquire whether God had commanded this to be done, whether he had any just cause for doing so; but they took this principle as granted, that wrong was done to God when anything was alleged against the dignity of the Temple, and also that the city was sacred, and therefore nothing could be said 			 against it without derogating from many and peculiar promises of God, since he had testified that it would be ever safe, because he dwelt in the midst of it. We hence see by what right, and under what pretense the priests and the prophets condemned Jeremiah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.viii-p7"></A>And by saying, <i>in the name of Jehovah, </i>they no doubt accused him as a cheat, or a false pretender, because he had said that this had been commanded by God, for they considered such a thing impossible and preposterous. God had promised that Jerusalem would be his perpetual habitation; the words of Jeremiah were, 			 &#8220;I will make this city like Shiloh.&#8221; God seemed in appearance to be inconsistent with himself, &#8220;This is my rest for ever,&#8221; &#8220;this shall be a desert.&#8221; We hence see that the priests and the prophets were not without some specious pretext for condemning Jeremiah. There is therefore some weight in what they said, &#8220;Dost thou not make God contrary to himself? for what thou denouncest in his name openly and directly conflicts with his promises; but God 			 is ever consistent with himself; thou art therefore a cheat and a liar, and thus one of the false prophets, whom God suffers not in his Church.&#8221; And yet what they boasted was wholly frivolous; for God had not promised that the Temple should be perpetual in order to give license to the people to indulge in all manner of wickedness. It was not then God&#8217;s purpose to bind himself to ungodly men, that they might expose his name to open reproach. It is hence evident that the prophets and priests only 			 dissembled, when they took as granted what ought to have been understood conditionally, that is, if they worshipped him in sincerity as he had commanded. For it was not right to separate two things which God had connected; he required piety and obedience from the people, and he also promised that he would be the guardian of the city, and that the Temple would be safe under his protection. But the Jews, having neither faith nor repentance, boasted of what had been said of the Temple, nay, they 			 bragged, as we have seen elsewhere, and spoke false things; and hence the Prophet derided them by repeating three times,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ix.viii-p8"></A>&#8220;The Temple of Jehovah, the Temple of Jehovah, the Temple of Jehovah,&#8221; (<a name="ix.viii-p8.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004">Jer 7:4</a><a name="ix.viii-p8.1"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.viii-p9"></A>as though he had said, &#8212; &#8220;This is your silly talk, you ever cry boastingly, &#8216;The Temple of God;&#8217; but all this will avail you nothing.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.viii-p10"></A>It then follows, that <i>the people were assembled</i> Here Jeremiah passes to another part of the narrative, for he reminded the princes and the king&#8217;s councillors that they were not without reason roused to go up to the Temple.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">163</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.viii-p14"></A>If the dispute had been between few, either Jeremiah would have been slain, or in some way intercepted, or it might have been that the princes would have circumvented the king and his councillors, and thus the holy man would have been privately crushed. But here he introduced these words, that the whole people were assembled against him. Hence it was that the report, reached the king&#8217;s court; and so the princes and councillors were commanded 			 to come. In short, Jeremiah shews the reason why the princes came unto the Temple; it was because the city was everywhere in a commotion, when the report spread that something new and intolerable had been announced. The king therefore could not neglect this commotion; for it is a dangerous thing to allow a popular tumult to prevail. And therefore Jeremiah thus adds, &#8212;</p>  <a name="ix.ix"></A>

<p><a name="ix.ix-p3"></A><b>10</b>. Et audierunt principes Jehudah sermones hos, et ascenderunt e domo regis in domum Jehovae (<i>hoc est, a palatio regis in Templum,)</i> et sederunt in foribus portae Templi Jehovae novae.</p>

<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ix-p5"></A><a name="ix.ix-p5.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ix-p6"></A>We have said that the princes were roused by a popular clamor; nor is there a doubt but; that the king had sent them to quell the commotion. It must be especially noticed, that they were engaged in other matters, as it was seldom the case that courtiers spent their time in hearing the prophets. It is indeed true, that the occupations of those are sacred, who have the care of the commonwealth, who dispense justice, and who have to provide for 			 the public safety; but it behoves them so to divide their time, that they may be able to consecrate some portion of it to God. But courtiers think themselves exempted by a sort of privilege, when yet the truth is more necessary for them than even for the common people; for not only the duty of the head of a family lies on each of them, but the Lord has also set them over a whole people. If, then, private men have need of being daily taught, that they may faithfully rule and guide themselves and 			 their families, what ought to be done by those rulers who are as it were the fathers of the commonwealth? But as I have already said, such men usually exempt themselves from the yoke of the faithful.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ix-p7"></A>Hence then it was, that none of the princes were present, when Jeremiah had been commanded to proclaim his message, not only on the day when few came to the Temple, but when they came from all the cities of Judah to sacrifice at Jerusalem. It was, indeed, a very shameful sign of gross contempt, that no one of the king&#8217;s counsellors appeared in the Temple, when there were present, from remote places, those whom religion and the 			 desire to sacrifice had brought there. But he says that they came to know the cause of the commotion; for it is said, that they <i>sat at the new gate, </i>which some say was eastward; and they conjecture that it was called new, because it had been renewed; the king&#8217;s palace was also towards the east, and the eastern gate was his tribunal. I am disposed to embrace this opinion, that they 			 sat at the eastern gate.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">164</FONT></A>

<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.x-p5"></A><a name="ix.x-p5.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.x-p6"></A>We hence conclude, that the people in assenting to the sentence of the priests and prophets, had done nothing according to their own judgment, but that all of every rank through a violent feeling condemned Jeremiah. And as the priests and prophets directed also their discourse to the people, it appears clear, that they were guided by them, so that they thoughtlessly and inconsiderately gave their consent; for it often happens in a mob that the 			 people exclaim, &#8220;Be it so, be it so; amen, amen.&#8221; Jeremiah has indeed said, that he was condemned by the whole people; but it must be observed, that the people are like the sea, which of itself is calm and tranquil; but as soon as any wind arises, there is a great commotion, and waves dash one against another; so also it is with the people, who without being excit<i>ed </i>are quiet and peaceable; but a sedition is easily raised, when any one stirs up men who are thoughtless and 			 changeable, and who, to retain the same simile, are fluid like water. This, then, is what Jeremiah now intimates.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.x-p7"></A>But there is another thing to be noticed, &#8212; that the common people suffer themselves to be drawn in all directions; but they may also be easily restored, as it has been said, to a right mind. &#8220;When they see,&#8221; says Virgil, &#8220;a man remarkable for piety and good works, they become silent and attend with listening ears.&#8221; He there describes (Aeneid, 1) a popular commotion, which he compares to a tempest; and he rightly speaks of a tempest; but he 			 added this simile according to common usage. The same thing is now set before us by the Prophet; the priests and prophets, who thought that they alone could boast of their power and speak with authority, in a manner constrained the people apparently to consent. The king&#8217;s counsellors being now present, the people became as it were mute; the priests perceived this, and we shall see by the issue that what the same poet mentions took place, &#8220;By his words he rules their hearts and softens 			 their breasts.&#8221; For it became easy for the king&#8217;s counsellors even by a word to calm this foolish violence of the people. We shall indeed soon see, that they unhesitantly said, &#8220;There is no judgment of death against this man.&#8221; It is hence evident how easily ignorant men may be made inconsistent with themselves; but this is to be ascribed to their inconstancy; and noticed also ought to be what I have said, that there was no real consent, because there was no judgment exercised. The 			 authority of the priests overpowered them; and then they servilely confessed what they saw pleased their princes, like an ass, who nods with his ears.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.x-p8"></A>Now, when the subject is duly considered, it appears, that the priests and the prophets alone spoke both to the princes and to the whole people, that Jeremiah was guilty of death,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">165</FONT></A>
 			 because he had prophesied against the city. We have said that they relied on those promises, which they absurdly applied for the purpose of confirming their own impiety, even that God had chosen that city that he might be there worshipped. It was a false principle, and whence proceeded their error? not from mere ignorance, but rather from presumption, for hypocrites are never deceived, except when they determine not to obey God, and as far as they can to reject his judgments. When, 			 therefore, they are carried away by a perverse and wicked impulse, they ever find out some plausible pretext; but it is nothing but a disguise, as we clearly see from this narrative. It follows, &#8212;</p>  <a name="ix.xi"></A>

<p><a name="ix.xi-p6"></A>Jeremiah pleads only his own calling and the command of God; and thus he confutes the preposterous charge which they most impudently brought against him. There is no doubt but that he might have spoken at large, but he deemed it enough to include the substance of his defense. Had he made a long discourse, the main point might have been more obscure. He now clearly makes known the state of the question on both sides. The priests by their own 			 authority condemned Jeremiah, because he reduced to nothing [as they thought] God&#8217;s promises, for he had threatened destruction to the city and to the temple; but Jeremiah on the other side answers, that he had declared nothing but what God had enjoined. There was need of proof, when the priests held that God was inconsistent with himself in denouncing destruction on that city, which he had undertaken to defend and protect. But the confutation of this was ready at hand, &#8212; that God had never 			 bound himself to hypocrites and ungodly men; nay, the whole glory of the city and the majesty of the Temple were dependent on his worship; nor is there any doubt but that Jeremiah had alleged these things. But as it was the main thing, he was satisfied with stating that he had been sent by God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xi-p7"></A>Thus he indirectly condemned their vain boastings, &#8212; that God was on their side; but he says, &#8220;I come not except by God&#8217;s command.&#8221; Now, though he declares briefly and distinctly that he had been sent by God, he yet presents himself as ready to prove everything; and as I have already said, there is no doubt but that he answered and discussed that frivolous question on which the priests so much insisted.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xi-p8"></A>It is further worthy of being noticed, that he addressed both the princes and the people; and thus he intimated that the priests and the prophets were deaf, and not worthy of being spoken to; for it was their determination proudly to despise God, and to carry on war, as it were avowedly, with his servants; for he would have otherwise no doubt gladly endeavored to restore them to the way of safety. But as he saw that they had closed the door 			 against themselves, he passed them by. This is the reason why he says, that he spoke to the princes and to the people, having passed by those, on whom he must have spent labor in vain. And surely when they said that he was worthy of death, they proved by such a presumption that they would not be taught by him; and also their cruelty prevented them from being teachable. But the Prophet had regard to the very source of evil, because their object was obstinately to resist God and all his 			 prophets.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xi-p9"></A>By saying, that he was sent to <i>prophesy </i>all that they had <i>heard, </i>he made them judges, though he did not address them together with the princes; for we have seen that the latter were in the king&#8217;s palace, and had been sent for 			 when there was a fear of some commotion. But there is no doubt but that the address was repeated again. Jeremiah then made them judges and arbitrators, when he said that he retracted nothing, but that what they had heard, he had faithfully declared according to the command of God. It follows, &#8212;</p>  <a name="ix.xii"></A>

<p><a name="ix.xii-p6"></A>He not only confirms here what he had taught, but also reproves the hardness and obstinate wickedness of the priests and prophets; for though he addressed the princes and the people, he yet no doubt designed to touch more sharply those ungodly men who set themselves up against God; and at the same time his discourse referred to them all, when he said, &#8220;How have I sinned? I have endeavored to promote your safety, must I therefore 			 die?&#8221; We hence see that the Prophet not only confirmed what he had said, but also accused his adversaries of ingratitude; for nothing could have been more kind, and ought to have been more acceptable, than to be called to repent, that they might receive mercy from God: &#8220;What was the object of my doctrine? even that ye might repent; and what does repentance bring? even salvation; for God is ready to forgive you. Now ye cannot bear to hear, that God would be merciful to you. What 			 madness is this?&#8221; We now then see the design of the Prophet.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xii-p7"></A>And this passage deserves to be noticed; for God will render to all the ungodly their own reward; not only because they harden themselves against every instruction, but also because they are manifest and, as it were, sworn enemies to their own salvation, inasmuch as they refuse the necessary remedy, and do not allow themselves to be restored to the right way, that they may be forgiven. Very weighty, then, is what he now says, that no fault 			 could be found in his doctrine, except that it proved galling to the wicked, but that they could yet obtain peace, provided they sought reconciliation with God.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">166</FONT></A>

Here, then, he triumphantly declares that he had taught them nothing that was alien to the Law, and that the Jews were inexcusable who professed Jehovah to be their God, and yet hearkened not to his voice, which ought to have been familiar to them.</p>  <a name="ix.xiii"></A>

<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.xv-p7"></A><a name="ix.xv-p7.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p8"></A>Jeremiah, after having exhorted the princes, the priests, and the whole people to repent, and having shewn to them that there was a remedy for their evil, except by their obstinacy they provoked more and more the wrath of God, now speaks of himself, and warns them not to indulge their cruelty by following their determination to kill him; for they had brought in a sentence that he deserved to die. He then saw that their rage was so violent, that 			 he almost despaired of his life; but he declares here that God would be an avenger if they unjustly vented their rage against him. He yet shews that he was not so solicitous about his life as to neglect his duty, for he surrendered himself to their will; &#8220;Do what ye please,&#8221; he says, &#8220;with me; yet see what ye do; for the Lord will not suffer innocent blood to be shed with impunity.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p9"></A>By saying that he was in their <i>hand, </i>he does not mean that he was not under the <i>care </i>of God. Christ also spoke thus when he exhorted his disciples not to fear those who could kill the body. (<a name="ix.xv-p9.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028">Mt 10:28</a><a name="ix.xv-p9.1"></A>.) There is no doubt but that the hairs of our head are numbered before God; thus it cannot be that tyrants, however they may rage, can touch us, no, not with their little finger, except a permission be given them. It is, then, certain that our life can never be in the hand of men, for God is its faithful keeper; but Jeremiah said, after a human manner, that his life was in their hand; for God&#8217;s providence is 			 hidden from us, nor can we discover it but by the eyes of faith. When, therefore, enemies seem to rule so that there is no escape, the Scripture says, by way of concession, that we are in their hands, that is, as far as we perceive. We ought yet to understand that we are by no means so exposed to the will of the wicked that they can do what they please with us; for God restrains them by a hidden bridle, and rules their hands and their hearts. This truth ought ever to remain unalterable, that 			 our life is under the custody and protection of God.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.xv-p10"></A><a name="ix.xv-p10.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p11"></A>We now, then, see in what sense Jeremiah regarded his life as in the hand of his enemies, not that he thought himself cast away by God, but that he acknowledged that loosened reins were given to the wicked to rage against him. But we must at the same time bear in mind why he said this; after having conceded that his life was in 			 their hand, he adds, <i>yet knowing know ye, that if ye kill me, ye will bring innocent blood upon yourselves.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">167</FONT></A>
 			  But he had said before that they might <i>do what seemed them good and right</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">168</FONT></A>
 			  Good and right here is not to be taken for a judgment formed according to the rule of justice, but for a sentence formed iniquitously according to their own will. This is a common mode of speaking in Hebrew. Jeremiah then testifies that he was not solicitous about his life, for he was prepared to offer himself, as it were, as a sacrifice, if the rage of his enemies should go so far. But in warning them to beware of God&#8217;s vengeance, his 			 object was not his own safety, but it was to stimulate them to repentance. He then plainly says that he did not fear death, for the Lord would presently shew himself to be his avenger, and that his blood also would be so precious in the sight of God, that the whole city, together with the people, would be punished, were they to deal unjustly with him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p14"></A>But let us attend to what follows, even that God had <i>sent </i>him. He now takes this principle as granted, that it could not be that God would forsake his servants, to whom he has promised aid when oppressed by the ungodly. God, indeed, ever exhorts his ministers to patience, and he would have them to be prepared for death whenever there is need; yet he promises to bring them help in distress. Jeremiah then relied on this promise, and was 			 thus persuaded that it could not be that God would forsake him; for he cannot disappoint his people, nor forfeit his faith pledged to them. As, then, he was fully persuaded of his own calling, and knew that God was the author of all his preaching, he boldly concluded that his blood could not be shed with impunity. All faithful teachers ought to encourage themselves, for the purpose of discharging strenuously the duties of their office, with this confidence, &#8212; that God who has committed 			 to them their office can never forsake them, but will ever bring them help as far as it may be necessary. It now follows, &#8212;</p>  <a name="ix.xvi"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption21"><a name="ix.xvi-p1"></A><a name="ix.xvi-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#016">Jeremiah 26:16</a><a name="ix.xvi-p1.1"></A></p>

<p><a name="ix.xvi-p6"></A>Jeremiah shews here that the sentence pronounced on him by the priests and false prophets was soon changed. They had indeed heard him, and had given some appearance of docility, as it is the case with hypocrites who for a time attend; but they exasperated themselves against God, and as their minds were previously malignant, they were rendered much worse by hearing. So it happened to the priests and false prophets, and in their blind rage they 			 doomed the holy Prophet to death. He now says that he was acquitted by the princes and the king&#8217;s counsellors, and also by the votes of the people. The people had, indeed, lately condemned him, but they had been carried away by the vain pomp and splendor of the priests and prophets; when they saw these so incensed against Jeremiah, they could not bring themselves to inquire into the cause. Thus the common people are always blinded by prejudices, so that they will not examine the matter itself. 			 So it was when Jeremiah was condemned. We have said that the people were of themselves quiet and peaceable; but the prophets and priests were the farmers, and hence it was that the people immediately gave their consent. But in the presence of the princes they went in a contrary direction.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvi-p7"></A>This passage, in short, teaches us how mischievous are rulers when there is no regard had for equity or justice; and it also teaches us how desirable it is to have honest and temperate rulers, who defend what is good and just, and aid the miserable and the oppressed. But we see that there is nothing steady or fixed in the common people; for they are carried here and there like the wind, which blows now from this quarter and then from that.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvi-p8"></A>But we must notice this clause, that <i>Jeremiah was not worthy of death,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_168"></A><A HREF="#fn_168"><FONT SIZE="1">169</FONT></A>
 			  <i>because he had spoken in the name of Jehovah</i> They thus confessed, that whatever came from God ought to have been received, and that men were mad who opposed the servants of God, for they hurried themselves headlong into their own destruction.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvi-p10"></A>We may hence deduce a useful truth, that whatever God has commanded ought, without exception, to be reverently received, and that his name is worthy of such a regard, that we ought to attempt nothing against his servants and prophets. Now, to speak in the name of Jehovah is no other thing than faithfully to declare what God has commanded. The false prophets, indeed, assumed the name of God, but they did so falsely; but the people acknowledge 			 here that Jeremiah was a true prophet, who did not presumptuously thrust in himself, nor falsely pretended God&#8217;s name, but who in sincerity performed the duties of his office.

<p><a name="ix.xvii-p10"></A>It is uncertain whether what is here recited was spoken before the acquittal of Jeremiah or not; for the Scripture does not always exactly preserve order in narrating things. It is yet probable, that while they were still deliberating and the minds of the people were not sufficiently pacified, the elders interposed, in order to calm the multitude and to soften their irritated minds, and to reconcile those to Jeremiah who had previously 			 become foolishly incensed against him; for no doubt the priests and the false prophets had endeavored by every artifice to irritate the silly people against the Prophet; and hence more than one kind of remedy was necessary. When therefore the elders saw that wrath was still burning in the people, and that their minds were not disposed to shew kindness, they made use of this discourse. They took their argument from example, &#8212; that Jeremiah was not the first witness and herald of dreadful 			 vengeance, for God had before that time, and in time past, been wont to speak by his other prophets against the city and the temple.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvii-p11"></A>The priests and the prophets had indeed charged Jeremiah with novelty, and further pretended that they thus fiercely opposed him on the ground of common justice. Jeremiah had said, that God would spare neither the holy city nor the Temple. This was intolerable, for it had been said of the Temple,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ix.xvii-p12"></A>&#8220;This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell.&#8221; <br> 			 (<a name="ix.xvii-p12.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014">Ps 132:14</a><a name="ix.xvii-p12.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvii-p13"></A>We hence see that Jeremiah was overwhelmed as it were by this one expression, while the priests and the false prophets objected and said,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ix.xvii-p14"></A>&#8220;Thou then makest void God&#8217;s promises; thou regardest as nothing the sanctity of the Temple.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvii-p15"></A>And they further pretended that not one of the prophets had ever thus spoken. But what do the elders now answer? even that there had been other prophets who had denounced ruin on the city and the Temple, and that, was falsely charged with this disgrace, that he was the first to announce God&#8217;s judgment. We now understand the state of the case: Jeremiah is defended, because he had not alone threatened the city and the first, but he had others 			 as the originators, from whose mouths he had spoken, who were also the acknowledged servants of God, from whom credit could not be withholden, such as Micah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvii-p16"></A>Now, what is here related is found in <a name="ix.xvii-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012">Mic 3:12</a><a name="ix.xvii-p16.1"></A>. The Prophet Micah had the same contest with the priests and prophets as Jeremiah had; for they said that it was impossible that God should pour his vengeance on the holy city and the Temple. They said,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ix.xvii-p17"></A>&#8220;Is not Jehovah in the midst of us?&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvii-p18"></A>and they said also, &#8220;No evil shall come on us.&#8221; They were inebriated with such a security, that they thought themselves beyond the reach of danger; and they disregarded all the threatenings of the prophets, because they imagined that God was bound to them. We indeed know that hypocrites ever relied on that promise, &#8220;Here will I dwell;&#8221; and they also took and borrowed words from God&#8217;s mouth and perverted them like cheats: &#8220;God resides in the 			 midst of us; therefore nothing adverse can happen to us.&#8221; But the Prophet said, (the same are the words which we have just repeated,)</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ix.xvii-p19"></A>&#8220;For you Sion shall be plowed as a field,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_169"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">170</FONT></A>
 			  and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of this house as the heights of a forest.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvii-p21"></A>But let us now consider each clause. It is first said, that the <i>elders from the people of the land rose up</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">171</FONT></A>
 			  It is probable that they were called elders, not as in other places on account of their <i>office, </i>but of their age. It is indeed certain that they were men of authority; but yet I doubt not but that they were far advanced in years, as they were able to relate to the people what 			 had happened many years before. As it is added, that they spoke to <i>the whole assembly of the people, </i>we may hence deduce what I have already stated, &#8212; that the people were so violent, that there was need of a calm discourse to mitigate their ardor; and certainly when once a commotion is raised and rages, it is not an easy matter immediately to allay it. When, therefore, the kind 			 elders saw that the minds of the people were still exasperated, they employed a moderating language, and said, <i>Micah</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">172</FONT></A>
 			  <i>the Morasthite </i>(they named his country) <i>prophesied in the days of Hezekiah, king of Judah, etc</i></p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.xvii-p24"></A><a name="ix.xvii-p24.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvii-p25"></A>We ought to notice the time, for it might seem strange, that when that holy king was anxiously engaged in promoting the true worship of God, things were in so disordered a state as to call for so severe a denunciation. If there ever was a king really and seriously devoted to the cause of religion, doubtless he was the first and chief exemplar; he spared no labor, he never seemed to shun any danger or trouble, whenever religion required this; 			 but we find that however strenuously he labored, he could not by his zeal and perseverance succeed in making the whole people to follow him as their leader. What then must happen, when those who ought to shew the right way to others are indifferent and slothful? In the meantime the good princes were confirmed by the example of Hezekiah, so that they did not faint or fail in their minds when they saw that success did not immediately follow his labors, nor any fruit. For it is a grievous trial, 			 and what shakes even the most courageous, when they think that their efforts are vain, that their labors are useless, yea, that they spend their time to no purpose, and thus it happens that many retrograde. But this example of Hezekiah ought to be remembered by them, so that they may still go on, though no hope of a prosperous issue appears; for Hezekiah did not desist, though Satan in various ways put many hinderances in the way, and even apparently upset all his labors, so that they produced 			 no fruit. So much as to the time that is mentioned.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvii-p26"></A>The elders said, that Micah had spoken to the whole people, saying, <i>Thus saith Jehovah, Sion, shall be plowed as a field, </i>We have already seen on what occasion it was that Micah spoke with so much severity; it was when hypocrites set up their false confidence and falsely assumed the name of God, as though 			 they held him bound to themselves. <i>For you, </i>he said, <i>Sion shall be plowed as a field</i> He began with the temple, and then he added, <i>and Jerusalem shall be in heaps, 			 </i>or a solitude; and lastly, he said, <i>and the mountain, of the house, </i>that is, of the temple, etc. He repeated what he had just said, for what else was the mountain of the temple but Sion? But as this prediction could have hardly been believed by the Jews, the Prophet, for the sake of confirmation, said the same thing twice. We hence conclude that it was 			 not a superfluous repetition, but that he might shake with terror the hypocrites, who had hardened themselves against God&#8217;s threatenings, and thought themselves safe, though the whole world went to ruin.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.xvii-p27"></A><a name="ix.xvii-p27.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvii-p28"></A>Having now related what Micah had denounced, they added, <i>Slaying, did Hezekiah the king of Judah and all Judah slay him? </i>By the example of the pious King Hezekiah, they exhorted the people to shew kindness and docility, and shewed that it was an honor done both to God and to his prophets, not to be incensed against his reproofs and 			 threatenings, however sharply they might have been goaded or however deeply they might have been wounded. But they further added, <i>Did he not fear Jehovah? and supplicate the face of Jehovah? and did not Jehovah repent? </i>They confirmed what Jeremiah had previously said, that there was no other remedy but to submit themselves calmly to prophetic instruction, and at the same time to flee to the mercy of God; 			 for by the fear of God here is meant true conversion; what else is God&#8217;s fear than that reverence by which we shew that we are submissive to his will, because he is a Father and a Sovereign? Whosoever, then, owns God as a Father and a Sovereign, cannot do otherwise than to submit from the heart, to his good pleasure. Therefore the elders meant that Hezekiah and the whole people really turned to God. Now repentance, as it must be well known, contains two parts &#8212; the sinner becomes displeased 			 with himself on account of his vices &#8212; and forsaking all the wicked lusts of the flesh, he desires to form his whole life and his actions according to the rule of God&#8217;s righteousness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvii-p29"></A>But they added, that they <i>supplicated, </i>etc. Though Jeremiah uses the singular number, he yet includes both the people and the king; he seems however to have used the singular number designedly, in order to commend the king, whose piety was extraordinary and almost incomparable. There is no doubt but that he pointed out the right way to others, that they might repent, and 			 also that he humbly deprecated that vengeance, which justly filled their minds with terror. He, indeed, ascribed this especially to the pious king; but the same concern is also to be extended to the chief men and the whole body of the people, as we shall presently see; <i>did he not then supplicate the face of Jehovah?</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvii-p30"></A>This second clause deserves special notice; for a sinner will never return to God except he has the hope of pardon and salvation, as we shall ever dread the presence of God, except the hope of reconciliation be offered to us. Hence the Scripture, whenever it speaks of repentance, at the same time adds faith. They are indeed things wholly distinct, and yet not contrary, and ought never to be separated, as some 			 inconsiderately do. For repentance is a change of the whole life, and as it were a renovation; and faith teaches the guilty to flee to the mercy of God. But still we must observe that there is a difference between repentance and faith; and yet they so unite together, that he who tears the one from the other, entirely loses both. This is the order which the Prophet now follows in saying that Hezekiah <i>supplicated the face of 			 Jehovah</i> For whence is the desire to pray, except from faith? It is not then enough for one to feel hatred and displeasure as to his sins, and to desire to be conformed to God&#8217;s will, except he thinks of reconciliation and pardon. The elders then pointed out the remedy, and shewed it as it were by the finger; for if the people after the example of Hezekiah and of others repented, then they were to flee to God&#8217;s mercy, and to testify 			 their faith by praying God to be propitious to them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvii-p31"></A>Hence it follows, that Jehovah <i>repented of the evil which he had spoken against them</i> The Prophet now makes use of the plural number; we hence conclude that under the name of King Hezekiah alone he before included the whole people. God then <i>repented of 			 the evil</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">173</FONT></A>
 			  As to this mode of speaking, I shall not now speak at large. We know that no change belongs to God; for whence comes repentance, except from this, &#8212; that many things happen unexpectedly which compel us to change our purpose? one had intended something; but he thought that that would be which never came to pass; it is therefore necessary for him to revoke what he had determined. Repentance then is the associate of ignorance. Now, as 			 nothing is hid from God, so it can never be that he repents. How so? because he has never determined anything but according to his certain foreknowledge, for all things are before his eyes. But this kind of speaking, that God repents, that is, does not execute what he has announced, refers to what appears to men. It is no wonder that God thus condescendingly speaks to us; but, while this simplicity offends delicate and tender ears, we on the contrary wonder at God&#8217;s indulgence in thus coming 			 down to us, and speaking according to the comprehension of our weak capacities. We now perceive how God may be said to repent, even when he does not execute what he had denounced. His purpose in the meantime remains fixed, and as James says,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ix.xvii-p33"></A>&#8220;There is in him no shadow of turning.&#8221; (<a name="ix.xvii-p33.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017">Jas 1:17</a><a name="ix.xvii-p33.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvii-p34"></A>But a question may again be raised, How did God then repent of the evil which he had threatened both to the king and to the people? even because he deferred his vengeance; for God did not abrogate his decree or his proclamation, but spared Hezekiah and the people then living. Then the deferring of God&#8217;s vengeance is called his repentance; for Hezekiah did not experience what he had feared, inasmuch as he saw not the ruin of the city nor the 			 sad and dreadful event which Micah had predicted.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvii-p35"></A>Now this also is to be noticed, &#8212; that the pious king is here commended by the Holy Spirit, that he suffered himself to be severely reproved, though, as I have already said, he was not himself guilty. He had, indeed, a burning zeal, and was prepared to undergo any troubles in promoting the true worship of God; and yet he calmly and quietly bore with the Prophet, when he spoke of the destruction of the city and Temple, for he saw that he had 			 need of such a helper. For however wisely may pious princes exert themselves in promoting the glory of God, yet Satan resists them. Hence they ever desire, as a matter of no small importance, to have true and faithful teachers to help, to assist and to strengthen them, and also to oppose their adversaries; for if teachers are silent or dissemble, a greater ill-will is entertained towards good princes and magistrates; for when with the drawn sword they defend the glory of God and his worship, 			 while the teachers themselves are dumb dogs, all will cry out, &#8220;Oh! what does this severity mean? Our teachers spare our ears, but these do not spare even our blood.&#8221; It is, therefore, ever a desirable thing for good and pious kings to have bold and earnest teachers, who cry aloud and confirm the efforts of their princes. Such was the feeling of pious Hezekiah, as we may conclude from this passage. The rest I must defer.</p>  <a name="ix.xviii"></A>

<p><a name="ix.xix-p2"></A>We saw yesterday the example which the elders had alleged to deliver Jeremiah from death, &#8212; that he was not the first who had threatened the city and the Temple with ruin, for Micah under the reign of Hezekiah had done the same and was not put to death. They hence concluded that it would be a heinous crime were they to slay Jeremiah, and that it would not remain unpunished. They then intimated that the people would commit a most grievous 			 offense, if they killed Jeremiah; and they also added, that vengeance would follow, for the Lord would render them their due reward, if they thus cruelly treated the holy Prophet. It now follows, &#8212;</p>  <a name="ix.xx"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption21"><a name="ix.xx-p1"></A><a name="ix.xx-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#020">Jeremiah 26:20-23</a><a name="ix.xx-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ix.xx-p2"></A><b>20.</b> And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ix.xx-p3"></A><b>20.</b> Atque etiam vir fuit prophetans in nomine Jehovae, Urias, filius Semeah ex Cariath-iarim, et prophetavit contra urbem hanc et contra terram hanc secundum sermones Jeremiae:</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ix.xx-p4"></A><b>21.</b> And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ix.xx-p5"></A><b>21.</b> Et audivit rex Joakim et omnes magnates ejus et Proceres sermones ejus, et quaesivit rex interficere ipsum, et audivit Urias et timuit, et fugit et transivit (vel, concessit) in Egyptum;</p>

<p><a name="ix.xx-p10"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.xx-p11"></A><a name="ix.xx-p11.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xx-p12"></A>Another example is brought forward, partly different, and partly alike, &#8212; different as to the king, the like as to a Prophet. Uriah, mentioned here, faithfully discharged his office; but Jehoiakim could not bear his preaching, and therefore slew him. Some explain the whole in the same manner, as though the elders designed to shew that the wicked can gain nothing by resisting God&#8217;s prophets, except that by contending 			 they make themselves more and more guilty. But others think that this part was brought forward by the opposite party, and the words, &#8220;And also,&#8221; <a name="ix.xx-p12.1"></A>&#1501;&#1490;&#1493;, <i>ugam, </i>favor this opinion; for they may be taken adversatively, as though they said, &#8220;But there was another Prophet, who did not speak of the ruin of the city and of the destruction of the Temple with impunity.&#8221; And this opinion seems to be confirmed by what follows in the last verse of the chapter, <i>Nevertheless </i>the hand of Ahikam, etc.; the particle <a name="ix.xx-p12.2"></A>&#1498;&#1488;, <i>ak, </i>is properly nevertheless; but it means sometimes, at least, or only. But in this place, as I shall shew again presently, it retains, I think, its proper meaning; for the Prophet declares, that though he was in great danger, yet Ahikam fought so bravely for him, that at length he gained his cause.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xx-p13"></A>But as to the present passage, both expositions may be admitted; that is, either that the malignants adduced the death of Uriah in order to overwhelm Jeremiah, &#8212; or that God&#8217;s faithful followers intended to shew that there was no reason of acting in this manner, for the state of things had become worse, since King Jehoiakim had cruelly slain God&#8217;s servant.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xx-p14"></A>But the time ought especially to be noticed. We have seen that this prophecy was committed to Jeremiah, and also promulgated at the beginning of Jehoiakim&#8217;s reign; but this beginning is not to be confined either to the first or second year; but as he became tributary to the king of Babylon, he afterwards endeavored to throw off the yoke and was at length disgracefully dethroned; hence the beginning of his reign must be during 			 the time that his power was entire. While then Jehoiakim retained his dignity, Jeremiah was bidden to proclaim this message. However this may have been, the King Jehoiakim thus enjoyed a tranquil reign; he was at Jerusalem. It is not therefore said here, that Uriah had threatened the city in his days; but the history is given as of a present thing. One thing then is evident, that this discourse was delivered, when King Jehoiakim was not afar off. His palace was nigh the Temple; his counsellors 			 were present who had come down, as we have seen, on account of the tumult. For the affair could not be hidden; since the priests and the false prophets everywhere inflamed the rage of the people. The king&#8217;s counsellors therefore came to quell the disturbances. If this part of the address is to be ascribed to the defenders of Jeremiah, then they must have been endued with great courage and firmness, to allege against the king a nefarious murder, and also to condemn him for a sacrilege, for he 			 had not only done an injury to a holy Prophet, but had directly opposed God himself. There are on both sides probable conjectures; for if we follow this opinion, that the servants of God, who favored Jeremiah and sought to deliver him from danger, spoke these words, it might be objected and said, that no such thing is expressed But the narrative goes on continuously, <i>And there was also a man, </i>etc. Now when different persons speak and oppose one another, it is usual to mark the change. It seems then that the whole is to be read connectedly, so that they who first adduced the example of Micah, then added on the other hand, that Uriah indeed suffered punishment, but that thus a crime was added to a crime, so that Jehoiakim gained nothing by furiously persecuting God&#8217;s Prophet. And that they did not speak of the consequences, ought not to appear strange, for the condition of 			 the city and of the people was known to all, and a more grievous danger was nigh at hand. Hence a simple narrative might well have been given by them; and as they did not dare to exasperate the mind of the king, it was the more necessary to leave that part untouched.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xx-p15"></A>But if the other view be more approved, that the enemies of Jeremiah did here rise against him, and alleged the case of Uriah, there is also some appearance of reason in its favor; the king was living, his counsellors were present, as we have said. It might then be, that those who wished the death of Jeremiah, referred to this recent example in order to have him destroyed, &#8212; &#8220;Why should he escape, since Uriah was lately put to death, for the 			 cause is exactly the same? Uriah did not go any farther than Jeremiah; he seems indeed to have taken the words from his mouth. As, then, the king did slay him, why should Jeremiah be spared? Why should he escape the punishment the other underwent, when his crime is more grievous?&#8221; It hence appears that this view can without absurdity be defended, that is, that the enemies of Jeremiah endeavored to aggravate his case by referring to the punishment the king inflicted on Uriah, whose case was not 			 dissimilar; and I do not reject this view. If any approve of the other, that this part was spoken by the advocates of Jeremiah, I readily allow it; but I dare not yet reject wholly the idea, that Jeremiah was loaded with prejudice by having the case of Uriah brought forward, who was killed by the king for having prophesied against the city and the Temple.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">174</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xx-p25"></A>Let us now consider the words; <i>There was also a man who prophesied in the name of Jehovah, </i>etc. If we receive the opinion of those who think that Jeremiah&#8217;s enemies speak here, then <i>the name of Jehovah </i>is to be taken for a 			 false pretense, as though they had said, &#8220;It is a very common thing to pretend the name of God; for every one who claims to himself the office of teaching, boasts that he is sent from above, and that what he speaks has been committed to him by God.&#8221; Thus they indirectly condemned Jeremiah; for it was not enough for him to pretend God&#8217;s name, as Uriah, of whom they spoke, had also professed most loudly that he was God&#8217;s prophet, that he brought nothing as his own, and that he had a sure call. 			 But if this part is to be ascribed to God&#8217;s true worshippers, whose object it was to protect and defend Jeremiah, to speak in the name of Jehovah, as we said yesterday, was not only to glory on account of the prophetic office, but also to give evidence of faithfulness and of integrity, so as really and by the effect to prove that he was God&#8217;s prophet, such as he wished to be thought.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xx-p26"></A>They then added, he <i>prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah</i> If the adversaries of Jeremiah were the speakers, we see that he was so overpowered, that it was afterwards superfluous to know anything more of his cause; for another had already been condemned, whose 			 case was in no way dissimilar or different; &#8220;He spoke <i>according to the words of Jeremiah, </i>and he was condemned, why then should we now hesitate respecting Jeremiah?&#8221; We see how malignantly they turned against Jeremiah this example, as though he was condemned beforehand in the person of another. But if these were the words of the godly, they are to be accounted for in another way; 			 what is intimated is, that if Jeremiah was slain, God&#8217;s vengeance would be provoked; for it was more than enough to shed the innocent blood of one Prophet.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.xx-p27"></A><a name="ix.xx-p27.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xx-p28"></A>It then follows, <i>And when, Jehoiakim the king, and all his mighty men and the princes, heard his words, etc</i>. This verse seems to favor the opinion of those who conclude that godly men were the speakers; for they spoke dishonorably of the king and his counsellors; the king heard and his mighty men, (powerful men, 			 literally,) and also all the princes; and <i>the king sought to slay him</i> These words, however, may also be ascribed to the ungodly and the wicked, for they wished to terrify the common people by first mentioning the king and then the mighty men and the princes. And to seek to kill him, might also have been excused, even that the king could not bear such a reproach without revenging 			 it; for he saw that the Prophet had taken such a liberty as not, to spare the holy city nor the Temple: <i>The king </i>then <i>heard, and his mighty men and princes; </i>and then, <i>the king sought to slay him</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xx-p29"></A><i>But when Uriah heard it, he feared and fled</i> This passage teaches us that even the faithful servants of God, who strive honestly to fulfill their office, are yet not always so courageous as boldly to despise all dangers; for it is said that the Prophet <i>feared; </i>but he was not on this account condemned. This fear was not indeed blameless; but his fear was such, that he yet continued in his vocation. He might indeed have pleased the king, but he dreaded such perfidy more than death. He, therefore, so feared, that he turned not aside from the right course, nor denied the truth., nor admitted anything unworthy of his dignity or of the character he sustained. His fear then, though wrong, did not yet so possess the 			 Prophet, but that he was ever faithful to God in his vocation. It then follows, that he <i>went into Egypt</i> We hence conclude, that the king&#8217;s wrath and cruelty were so great, that the holy man could not find a corner to hide himself in through the whole land of Judea, nor even in other regions around. He was therefore forced to seek a hiding place in Egypt.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.xx-p30"></A><a name="ix.xx-p30.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xx-p31"></A>It is afterwards added that the king <i>sent men, </i>even <i>Elnathan, </i>the chief of the legation, with others.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">175</FONT></A>
 			  There is no doubt but that Jehoiakim sent to the king of Egypt and complained that a turbulent man had fled, and that he asked him to deliver him up as a fugitive. So then he was brought back, not through power, but through a nefarious compact, for he was betrayed by the king of Egypt.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.xx-p34"></A><a name="ix.xx-p34.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xx-p35"></A>It is at length added, that they <i>led up Uriah from Egypt, and brought him to King Jehoiakim, who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people, </i>by way of dishonor; for Jeremiah here calls them the graves of the common people, as we in French call shambles <i>des charniers. 			 </i>The rich are honorably and splendidly buried at this day, and every one has his own grave; but when there is a vast number, the bodies are thrown together, for it would be too expensive to dig a grave for each. It seems also that there was such a practice in Judea, and that God&#8217;s Prophet was buried in this ignominious manner.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xx-p36"></A>Thus they who spoke intimated that the king&#8217;s wrath so burned, that he not only put him to death, but followed up his vengeance, so that a new disgrace awaited the Prophet, even when dead, for he was cast among the obscure and ignoble common people.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xx-p37"></A>I have hitherto so explained this passage as to leave it doubtful whether the probability is that the speakers were Jeremiah&#8217;s enemies or his advocates. And though, as I have declared twice or three times, I reject not the view which is different from that which I embrace, yet it seems most probable to me that the words were spoken by the godly men who defended the cause of Jeremiah. All the various reasons which lead me to this conclusion I 			 will not here specify; for every one may himself see why I prefer this view. The common consent of almost all interpreters also influences me, from which I wish not to depart, except necessity compels me, or the thing itself makes it evident that they were mistaken. But we have seen from the beginning, that the two examples consecutively follow one another, and that nothing intervenes; it may hence be supposed, that the enemies of Jeremiah had previously performed their part. The words 			 themselves then shew that those who commenced the discourse were those who carried it on. And that they did not mention the reason why they adduced this example is not to be wondered at; for the displeasure of the king was feared, and he had given no common proof, in his treatment of the holy Prophet, how impatiently he bore anything that trenched on his own dignity. They therefore cautiously related the matter, and left what they did not express to be collected by those who heard them. But it 			 was easy from their words to know what they meant, &#8212; that God&#8217;s vengeance was to be dreaded; for one Prophet had been slain; what if there was to be no end to cruelty? would not God at length arise to execute judgment when his servants were so unworthily treated? As, then, the words are not completed, it seems probable to me that God&#8217;s true servants spoke thus reservedly and cautiously, because they dared not to express their thoughts openly.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xx-p38"></A>Further, these words, <i>the king sought to slay him, </i>and <i>the king sent men, etc</i>., are more suitable when considered as spoken by the defenders of Jeremiah than by the ungodly and the wicked; and they 			 also named Elnathan, that they might hand down his name with infamy to future ages. And they lastly added that the Prophet <i>was brought up from Egypt</i>  What was very shameful seems certainly to be set here before us, that he was forcibly brought back from that land to which he had fled 			 for an asylum, and also that he was brought to the king, that he smote him with the sword, that is, cruelly killed him; and further, that being not satisfied with this barbarous act, he caused him to be ignominiously buried. All these particulars, as I have said, seem to shew that these words may be more suitably applied to the holy men who defended the cause of Jeremiah than to his enemies. It now follows, &#8212;</p>  <a name="ix.xxi"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption21"><a name="ix.xxi-p1"></A><a name="ix.xxi-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#024">Jeremiah 26:24</a><a name="ix.xxi-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ix.xxi-p2"></A><b>24.</b> Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ix.xxi-p3"></A><b>24.</b> Veruntamen manus Achicam, filii Saphan, fuit cum Jeremia, ne traderetur ipse (<i>vel,</i> ne traderent ipsum) in manum populi ad interficiendum ipsum.</p>

<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.xxi-p5"></A><a name="ix.xxi-p5.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxi-p6"></A>There is here an adversative particle, and not without reason; for the contention is pointed out which had so raged that it became difficult to extricate the holy Prophet from danger. We hence conclude that Jeremiah was in so much peril that it was with great and arduous effort that Ahikam saved him. There is a frequent mention of this man in sacred history, and his name will hereafter be found in several places, and he was left to govern the 			 remnant of the people after the demolition of the city. (<a name="ix.xxi-p6.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#022">2Ki 25:22</a><a name="ix.xxi-p6.1"></A>; <a name="ix.xxi-p6.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#014">Jer 39:14</a><a name="ix.xxi-p6.2"></A>.)  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">176</FONT></A>
 			 And there is no doubt but that he made progress in religion and was an upright man, and that his virtues were so valued by Nebuchadnezzar that he bestowed on him such an honor. He was soon afterwards slain by the ungodly and the wicked; but there is nothing related of him but what is honorable to him. It was indeed an extraordinary act of courage that he dared to oppose the fury of the whole people, and to check the priests and the false prophets who had conspired to put the holy man 			 to death.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxi-p8"></A>This is the reason why it is in the last place added, that <i>the hand of Ahikam was with Jeremiah; </i>though the people were furious, and the priests would by no means be restrained from persecuting the holy man, yet Ahikam could not be turned from his holy purpose, but persevered to defend a good cause until Jeremiah 			 escaped in safety. It is hence said, that his <i>hand was with Jeremiah; </i>for by hand in Scripture is meant effort, <i>(conatus;) </i>for where there is anything to be done, or any difficulty, the Scripture uses the word <i>hand</i> But 			 as Ahikam exerted himself to the uttermost, not only in aiding the holy Prophet by his words, but also in repressing the fury of the people, and in boldly resisting the priests and the false prophets, the <i>hand </i>in this place means aid; his <i>hand was with Jeremiah, </i>that is, he aided or helped 			 him, so that he was <i>not delivered up into the hand of the people</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxi-p9"></A>It hence also appears, as we said yesterday, that the tumult of the people was not immediately allayed, for the false prophets and the priests had so roused their virulence that they became almost implacable. Here, then, is set before us an example of courage and perseverance; for it is not enough for us to defend a good cause when we may do so with safety, except we also disregard all ill-will and despise all dangers, and resist the 			 fury of the wicked, and undergo contentions and dangers for God&#8217;s servants whenever necessary. We are also taught at the same time how much weight belongs to the influence of one man when he boldly defends a good cause and yields not to the madness of the wicked, but risks extremities rather than betray the truth of God and his ministers. Now follows, &#8212;</p>

The true reading no doubt is, &#8220;the house of Jehovah.&#8221; It was called &#8220;the new gate,&#8221; says Gataker, because it had been renewed by Jotham. See <a name="ix.ix-p8.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035">2Ki 15:35</a><a name="ix.ix-p8.1"></A>. It is 				  rendered &#8220;the eastern gate&#8221; by the Targ.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.xx-p16"></A> There are two other views taken of this subject; some say that the second example, that of Uriah, was introduced by the writer of the narrative, whether Jeremiah himself or Baruch, and that this was mentioned to shew, that according to this precedent, Jeremiah would have been killed, had it not been for the interposition of Ahikam. This is the view taken by Gataker and Blayney.</p>  				
<p><a name="ix.xx-p17"></A>But what appears most consistent with the whole passage is the view given by Venema; he considers that the 17th verse (<a name="ix.xx-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#017">Jer 26:17</a><a name="ix.xx-p17.1"></A>) has been removed from its place between the 19th and the 20th (<a name="ix.xx-p17.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#019">Jer 26:19-20</a><a name="ix.xx-p17.2"></A>), and that the &#8220;princes&#8221; 				  mentioned the case of Micah in favor of Jeremiah, and that &#8220;the elders of the land&#8221; adduced the case of Uriah against him, and that notwithstanding this it is at last added, that Ahikam, one of the princes, succeeded in his deliverance. That chapters have been transposed in this book is indubitable; the same thing may also have happened as to verses.</p>  				
<p><a name="ix.xx-p18"></A>Then the passage would read thus, &#8212;</p>  				
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xx-p19"></A><b>16.</b> Then said the princes and all the people to the priests and to the prophets, &#8220;Against this man there is no judgment of death, for in</p>  				
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xx-p20"></A><b>18.</b> the name of Jehovah hath he spoken to (or against) us. Micah the Morasthite was a prophet in the days of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, &#8216;Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Sion, being a field, shall be plowed, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house like the heights of</p>  				
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xx-p21"></A><b>19.</b> a forest.&#8217; Slaying, did Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and all Judah, slay him? did he not fear Jehovah and intreat the favor of Jehovah? then Jehovah repented as to the evil which he had pronounced against them; but we are doing a great evil against our own souls.&#8221;</p>  				
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xx-p22"></A><b>17.</b> Then rose up men from the elders of the land and spoke to the</p>  				
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xx-p23"></A><b>20.</b> whole assembly of the people, saying, &#8220;But there was also a man, who prophesied in the name of Jehovah, Uriah, the son of Shemaiah,&#8221; etc. etc.</p>  				
<p><a name="ix.xx-p24"></A>This arrangement makes the whole narrative plain, regular, and consistent. The conclusion comes in naturally, that notwithstanding the adverse speech of the &#8220;elders&#8221; Jeremiah was saved by the influence of Ahikam, one of the princes. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.xx-p32"></A> To avoid what may seem a tautology in this verse, Blayney renders the word for Egypt, adversaries, &#8212; &#8220;But Jehoiakim the king sent adversaries, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt.&#8221; Were the words rendered literally, the repetition would not appear different from many that we meet with; &#8220;Then sent the king Jehoiakim men into Egypt with Elnathan the son of Achbor, even men with him into Egypt.&#8221; The repetition seems to 				  have been intended to shew that there was a strong force, and not one man, sent to take the Prophet, and that this force was to go even as far as Egypt. The version of the Sept. is, &#8220;And the king sent men into Egypt;&#8221; the Vulg. and the Targ. are the same with our version; but the Syr. is, &#8220;And the king Jehoiakim sent a certain Egyptian, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and some with him, into Egypt.&#8221;</p>  				
<p><a name="ix.xx-p33"></A>It is singular that in one MS. the word <a name="ix.xx-p33.1"></A>&#1501;&#1497;&#1500;&#1490;&#1512;&#1502;, searchers, spies, is found instead of <a name="ix.xx-p33.2"></A>&#1501;&#1497;&#1512;&#1510;&#1502;, rendered often Egypt, though it comes from a root which means to bind close, to environ, to beset; and so as a hyphil 				  participle it would be besetters, or catchers &#8212; in modern language, bumbailiffs, which is a corruption for bound bailiffs. This meaning would exactly suit the passage, &#8220;Then the king Jehoiakim sent men, catchers, with Elnathan the son of Achbor, even these men with him into Egypt.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed</i></p> 			 </P>
