<p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN18"><a name="xiii-p1"></A>PSALM 104</p>  		
<p><a name="xiii-p2"></A>This psalm differs from the preceding, inasmuch as it neither treats of the special benefits which God bestows upon his Church, nor lifts us up to the hope of the heavenly life, but by presenting to us a lively image of his wisdom, power, and goodness in the creation of the world, and in the order of nature, encourages us to praise him for the manifestation he has made of himself as a father to us in this frail and perishable life.  		  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">176</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xiii.i-p7"></A><b>1</b>  <i>Bless Jehovah, O my soul!</i> After having exhorted himself to praise God, the Psalmist adds, that there is abundant matter for such an exercise; thus indirectly condemning himself and others of ingratitude, if the praises of God, than which nothing ought to be 			 better known, or more celebrated, are buried by silence. In comparing <i>the light</i> with which he represents God as <i>arrayed</i> to a garment, he intimates, that although God is invisible, yet his glory is conspicuous enough. In respect of his essence, God undoubtedly dwells in 			 light that is inaccessible; but as he irradiates the whole world by his splendor, this is the garment in which He, who is hidden in himself, appears in a manner visible to us. The knowledge of this truth is of the greatest importance. If men attempt to reach the infinite height to which God is exalted, although they fly above the clouds, they must fail in the midst of their course. Those who seek to see him in his naked majesty are certainly very foolish. That we may enjoy the light of him, he 			 must come forth to view with his clothing; that is to say, we must cast our eyes upon the very beautiful fabric of the world in which he wishes to be seen by us, and not be too curious and rash in searching into his secret essence. Now, since God presents himself to us clothed with light, those who are seeking pretexts for their living without the knowledge of him, cannot allege in excuse of their slothfulness, that he is hidden in profound darkness. When it is said that <i>the heavens are a curtain, </i>it is not meant that under them God hides himself, but that by them his majesty and glory are displayed; being, as it were, his royal pavilion.</p>

<p><a name="xiii.i-p9"></A><b>3.</b> <i>Laying the beams of his chambers in the waters</i> David now proceeds to explain at greater length what he had briefly stated under the figure of God&#8217;s raiment. The scope of the passage is shortly this, that we need not pierce our way above the clouds for the purpose of finding God, since 			 he meets us in the fabric of the world, and is everywhere exhibiting to our view scenes of the most vivid description. That we may not imagine that there is any thing in Him derived, as if, by the creation of the world, he received any addition to his essential perfection and glory, we must remember that he clothes himself with this robe for our sake. The metaphorical representation of God, as <i>laying the beams of his chambers in the 			 waters, </i>seems somewhat difficult to understand; but it was the design of the prophet, from a thing incomprehensible to us, to ravish us with the greater admiration. Unless beams be substantial and strong, they will not be able to sustain even the weight of an ordinary house. When, therefore, God makes the waters the foundation of his heavenly palace, who can fail to be astonished at a miracle so wonderful? When we take into account 			 our slowness of apprehension, such hyperbolical expressions are by no means superfluous; for it is with difficulty that they awaken and enable us to attain even a slight knowledge of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiii.i-p10"></A>What is meant by his <i>walking upon the wings of the wind, </i>is rendered more obvious from the following verse, where it is said, that <i>the winds are his messengers</i> God rides on the clouds, and is 			 carried upon the wings of the wind, inasmuch as he drives about the winds and clouds at his pleasure, and by sending them hither and thither as swiftly as he pleases, shows thereby the signs of his presence. By these words we are taught that the winds do not blow by chance, nor the lightnings flash by a fortuitous impulse, but that God, in the exercise of his sovereign power, rules and controls all the agitations and disturbances of the atmosphere. From this doctrine a twofold advantage may be 			 reaped. In the first place, if at any time noxious winds arise, if the south wind corrupt the air, or if the north wind scorch the corn, and not only tear up trees by the root, but overthrow houses, and if other winds destroy the fruits of the earth, we ought to tremble under these scourges of Providence. In the second place, if, on the other hand, God moderate the excessive heat by a gentle cooling breeze, if he purify the polluted atmosphere by the north wind, or if he moisten the parched 			 ground by south winds; in this we ought to contemplate his goodness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiii.i-p11"></A>As the apostle, who writes to the Hebrews, (<a name="xiii.i-p11.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007">Heb 1:7</a><a name="xiii.i-p11.2"></A>) quotes this passage, and applies it to the angels, both the Greek and Latin expositors have almost unanimously considered David as here speaking allegorically. In like manner, because Paul, in quoting <a name="xiii.i-p11.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#004">Ps 19:4</a><a name="xiii.i-p11.3"></A>, in his Epistle to the Romans, (<a name="xiii.i-p11.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018">Ro 10:18</a><a name="xiii.i-p11.4"></A>) seems to apply to the apostles what is there stated concerning the heavens, the whole psalm has been injudiciously expounded as if it were an allegory.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">179</FONT></A>
 			 The design of the apostle, in that part of the Epistle to the Hebrews referred to, was not simply to explain the mind of the prophet in this place; but since God is exhibited to us, as it were, visibly in a mirror, the apostle very properly lays down the analogy between the obedience which the winds manifestly and perceptibly yield to God, and that obedience which he receives from the angels. In short, the meaning is, that as God makes use of the winds as his messengers, turns them 			 hither and thither, calms and raises them whenever he pleases, that by their ministry he may declare his power, so the angels were created to execute his commands. And certainly we profit little in the contemplation of universal nature, if we do not behold with the eyes of faith that spiritual glory of which an image is presented to us in the world.</p>  <a name="xiii.ii"></A>

<p><a name="xiii.ii-p7"></A><b>5</b>  <i>He hath founded the earth upon its foundations</i> Here the prophet celebrates the glory of God, as manifested in the stability of the earth. Since it is suspended in the midst of the air, and is supported only by pillars of water, how does it keep its place so 			 steadfastly that it cannot be moved? This I indeed grant may be explained on natural principles; for the earth, as it occupies the lowest place, being the center of the world, naturally settles down there. But even in this contrivance there shines forth the wonderful power of God. Again, if the waters are higher than the earth, because they are lighter, why do they not cover the whole earth round about? Certainly the only answer which philosophers can give to this is, that the tendency of the 			 waters to do so is counteracted by the providence of God, that a dwelling-place might be provided for man. If they do not admit that the waters are restrained by the determinate appointment of God, they betray not only their depravity and unthankfulness, but also their ignorance, and are altogether barbarous. The prophet, therefore, not without reason, recounts among the miracles of God, that which would be to us wholly incredible, did not even experience show its truth. We are very base indeed 			 if, taught by such undoubted a proof, we do not learn that nothing in the world is stable except in as far as it is sustained by the hand of God. The world did not originate from itself, consequently, the whole order of nature depends on nothing else than his appointment, by which each element has its own peculiar property. Nor is the language of the prophet to be viewed merely as an exhortation to give thanks to God; it is also intended to strengthen our confidence in regard to the future, 			 that we may not live in the world in a state of constant fear and anxiety, as we must have done had not God testified that he has given the earth for a habitation to men. It is a singular blessing, which he bestows upon us, in his causing us to dwell upon the earth with undisturbed minds, by giving us the assurance that he has established it upon everlasting pillars. Although cities often perish by earthquakes, yet the body of the earth itself remains. Yea, all the agitations which befall it 			 more fully confirm to us the truth, that the earth would be swallowed up every moment were it not preserved by the secret power of God.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.ii-p8"></A><a name="xiii.ii-p8.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiii.ii-p9"></A><b>6.</b> <i>He hath covered it with the deep as with a garment, </i>This may be understood in two ways, either as implying that now the sea covers the earth as a garment, or that at the beginning, before God by his omnipotent word held gathered the waters together into one place, the earth was 			 covered with the deep. But the more suitable sense appears to be, that the sea is now the covering of the earth. At the first creation the deep was not so much a garment as a grave, inasmuch as nothing bears less resemblance to the adorning of apparel than the state of confused desolation and shapeless chaos in which the earth then was. Accordingly, in my judgment, there is here celebrated that wonderful arrangement by which the deep, although without form, is yet the garment of the earth. But 			 as the context seems to lead to a different view, interpreters are rather inclined to explain the language as denoting, That the earth was covered with the deep before the waters had been collected into a separate place. This difficulty is however easily solved, if the words of the prophet, <i>The waters shall stand above the mountains, </i>are resolved into the potential mood thus, 			 <i>The waters would stand above the mountains; </i>which is sufficiently vindicated from the usage of the Hebrew language. I have indeed no doubt that the prophet, after having said that God had clothed the earth with waters, adds, by way of exposition, that the waters would stand above the mountains, were it not that they flee away at God&#8217;s rebuke. Whence is it that the mountains are elevated, and that the valleys sink down, but because bounds are set 			 to the waters, that they may not return to overwhelm the earth? The passage then, it is obvious, may very properly be understood thus, &#8212; that the sea, although a mighty deep, which strikes terror by its vastness, is yet as a beautiful garment to the earth. The reason of the metaphor is, because the surface of the earth stands uncovered. The prophet affirms that this does not happen by chance; for, if the providence of God did not restrain the waters, would they not immediately rush forth to 			 overwhelm the whole earth? He, therefore, speaks advisedly when he maintains that the appearance of any part of the earth&#8217;s surface is not the effect of nature, but is an evident miracle. Were God to give loose reins to the sea, the waters would suddenly cover the mountains. But now, fleeing at God&#8217;s rebuke, they retire to a different quarter. By <i>the rebuke of God, and the voice of his thunder, 			 </i>is meant the awful command of God, by which he restrains the violent raging of the sea. Although at the beginning, by his word alone, he confined the sea within determinate bounds, and continues to this day to keep it within them, yet if we consider how tumultuously its billows cast up their foam when it is agitated, it is not without reason that the prophet speaks of it, as kept in check by the powerful command of God; just as, both in Jeremiah, (<a name="xiii.ii-p9.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022">Jer 5:22</a><a name="xiii.ii-p9.1"></A>) and in Job, (<a name="xiii.ii-p9.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#025">Job 28:25</a><a name="xiii.ii-p9.2"></A>) God, with much sublimity, commends his power, as displayed in the ocean. <i>The ascending of the mountains, and the descending of the valleys, </i>are poetical figures, implying, that unless God confined the deep within bounds, the distinction between mountains and valleys, which contributes to the beauty of the earth, would cease to exist, for it would engulf the whole earth. It is said that God <i>has founded a place for the valleys; </i>for there would be no dry land at the foot of the mountains, but the deep would 			 bear sway, did not God command the space there to be unoccupied by the sea, as it were contrary to nature.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.ii-p10"></A><a name="xiii.ii-p10.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiii.ii-p11"></A><b>9.</b><i> Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass</i> The miracle spoken of is in this verse amplified, from its perpetuity. Natural philosophers are compelled to admit, and it is even one of their first principles, that the water is circular, and occupies the region intermediate between the earth and the air. 			 It is entirely owing to the providence of God, that part of the earth remains dry and fit for the habitation of men. This is a fact of which mariners have the most satisfactory evidence. Yea, were even the rudest and most stupid of our race only to open their eyes, they would behold in the sea mountains of water elevated far above the level of the land. Certainly no banks, and even no iron gates, could make the waters, which in their own nature are fluid and unstable, keep together and in one 			 place, as we see to be the case. I have just now said that earthquakes, which bring destruction upon some places, leave the globe, upon the whole, as it was before; and in like manner, although the sea, in some parts of the world, overpasses its boundaries, yet the law, which confines it; within certain limits, stands fast, that the earth may be a fit habitation for men. The Baltic Sea, in our own time, inundated large tracts of land, and did great damage to the Flemish people and other 			 neighboring nations. By an instance of this kind we are warned what would be the consequence, were the restraint imposed upon the sea, by the hand of God, removed. How is it that we have not thereby been swallowed up together, but because God has held in that outrageous element by his word? In short, although the natural tendency of the waters is to cover the earth, yet this will not happen, because God has established, by his word, a counteracting law, and as his truth is eternal, this law 			 must remain steadfast.</p>  <a name="xiii.iii"></A>

<p><a name="xiii.iii-p11"></A><b>10.</b> <i>Sending out springs by the valleys</i> The Psalmist here describes another instance both of the power and goodness of God, which is, that he makes fountains to gush out in the mountains, and to run down through the midst of the valleys. Although it is necessary for the earth to be 			 dry, to render it a fit habitation for us, yet, unless we had water to drink, and unless the earth opened her veins, all kinds of living creatures would perish. The prophet, therefore, speaks in commendation of that arrangement by which the earth, though dry, yet supplies us with water by its moisture. The word <a name="xiii.iii-p11.1"></A>&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, <i>nechalim, </i>which I 			 have rendered <i>springs, </i>is by some translated, <i>torrents </i>or <i>rivers; </i>but <i>springs </i>is more appropriate. In the same sense it is added immediately after, that <i>they run among the 			 hills; </i>and yet, it is scarcely credible that fountains could spring forth from rocks and stony places. But here it may be asked, why the prophet says that <i>the beasts of the field quench their thirst, </i>rather than men, for whose sake the world was created? I would observe, in reply, that he obviously spake in this 			 manner, for the purpose of enhancing the goodness of God, who vouchsafes to extend his care to the brute creation, yea, even to the <i>wild asses, </i>under which species are included all other kinds of wild beasts. And he purposely refers to desert places, that each of us may compare with them the more pleasant, and the cultivated parts of the earth, afterwards mentioned. Rivers run 			 even through great and desolate wildernesses, where the wild beasts enjoy some blessing of God; and no country is so barren as not to have trees growing here and there, on which birds make the air to resound with the melody of their singing. Since even those regions where all lies waste and uncultivated, furnish manifest tokens of the Divine goodness and power, with what admiration ought we to regard that most abundant supply of all good things, which is to be seen in cultivated and favorable 			 regions? Surely in countries where not only one river flows, or where not only grass grows for the feeding of wild beasts, or where the singing of birds is heard not only from a few trees, but where a manifold and varied abundance of good things everywhere presents itself to our view, our stupidity is more than brutish, if our minds, by such manifestations of the goodness of God, are not fixed in devout meditation on his glory.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.iii-p12"></A><a name="xiii.iii-p12.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiii.iii-p13"></A>The same subject is prosecuted in the 13th verse, where it is said <i>that God watereth the mountains from his chambers</i> It is no ordinary miracle that the mountains, which seem to be condemned to perpetual drought, and which, in a manner, are suspended in the air, nevertheless abound in pastures. The prophet, 			 therefore, justly concludes that this fruitfulness proceeds from nothing else but the agency of God, who is their secret cultivator. Labour cannot indeed, in the proper sense, be attributed to God, but still it is not without reason applied to him, for, by merely blessing the earth from the place of his repose, he works more efficaciously than if all the men in the world were to waste themselves by incessant labor.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiii.iii-p14"></A><b>14.</b> <i>Making grass to grow for cattle</i> The Psalmist now comes to men, of whom God vouchsafes to take a special care as his children. After having spoken of the brute creation, he declares, that corn is produced, and bread made of it, for the nourishment of the human race; and he 			 mentions in addition to this, wine and oil, two things which not only supply the need of mankind, but also contribute to their cheerful enjoyment of life. Some understand the Hebrew word <a name="xiii.iii-p14.1"></A>&#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1514;, <i>la&auml;bodath, </i>which I have rendered <i>for the service, 			 </i>to denote the labor which men bestow in husbandry; for while grass grows on the mountains of itself, and without human labor, corn and herbs, which are sown, can only be produced, as is well known, by the labor and sweat of men. According to them the meaning is, that God blesses the toil of men in the cultivation of the fields. But this being too strained an interpretation, it is better to understand the word <i>service, </i>in the ordinary sense of the term. With respect to the word <i>bread, </i>I do not object to the view of those who understand it in a restricted sense, although it probably includes all kinds of food; only I dislike the opinion of those who exclude bread. There is no force in the reason which they allege 			 for taking this view, namely, that in the following verse another use of bread is added, when it is said, that it strengthens the heart of man; for there the same thing is expressed in different words. The prophet, in stating that God causeth the earth to bring forth <i>herbs</i> for the support of men, intends to say that the earth supplies them not only with food in corn, but also 			 with other herbs and fruits; for the means of our sustenance is not limited exclusively to one kind of food.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.iii-p15"></A><a name="xiii.iii-p15.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiii.iii-p16"></A><b>15.</b> <i>And wine that cheereth the heart of man</i> In these words we are taught, that God not only provides for men&#8217;s necessity, and bestows upon them as much as is sufficient for the ordinary purposes of life, but that in his goodness he deals still more bountifully with them by cheering 			 their hearts with wine and oil. Nature would certainly be satisfied with water to drink; and therefore the addition of wine is owing to God&#8217;s superabundant liberality. The expression, <i>and oil to make his face to shine, </i>has been explained in different ways. As sadness spreads a gloom over the countenance, some give this exposition, That when men enjoy the commodities of wine and 			 oil, their faces shine with gladness. Some with more refinement of interpretation, but without foundation, refer this to <i>lamps. </i>Others, considering the letter <a name="xiii.iii-p16.1"></A>&#1502;, <i>mem </i>to be the sign of the comparative degree, take the meaning to be, that wine makes men&#8217;s faces shine more than if they were 			 anointed with oil. But the prophet, I have no doubt, speaks of unguents, intimating that God not only bestows upon men what is sufficient for their moderate use, but that he goes beyond this, giving them even their delicacies.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiii.iii-p17"></A>The words in the last clause, <i>and bread that sustains man&#8217;s heart, </i>I interpret thus: Bread would be sufficient to support the life of man, but God over and above, to use a common expression, bestows upon them wine and oil. The repetition then of the purpose which bread serves is not superfluous: it is 			 employed to commend to us the goodness of God in his tenderly and abundantly nourishing men as a kind-hearted father does his children. For this reason, it is here stated again, that as God shows himself a foster-father sufficiently bountiful in providing bread, his liberality appears still more conspicuous in giving us dainties.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiii.iii-p18"></A>But as there is nothing to which we are more prone, than to abuse God&#8217;s benefits by giving way to excess, the more bountiful he is towards men, the more ought they to take care not to pollute, by their intemperance, the abundance which is presented before them. Paul had therefore good reason for giving that prohibition, (<a name="xiii.iii-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014">Ro 13:14</a><a name="xiii.iii-p18.1"></A>)</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xiii.iii-p19"></A>&#8220;Make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof;&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiii.iii-p20"></A>for if we give full scope to the desires of the flesh, there will be no bounds. As God bountifully provides for us, so he has appointed a law of temperance, that each may voluntarily restrain himself in his abundance. He sends out oxen and asses into pastures, and they content themselves with a sufficiency; but while furnishing us with more than we need, he enjoins upon us an observance of the rules of moderation, that we may not 			 voraciously devour his benefits; and in lavishing upon us a more abundant supply of good things than our necessities require, he puts our moderation to the test. The proper rule with respect to the use of bodily sustenance, is to partake of it that it may sustain, but not oppress us. The mutual communication of the things needful for the support of the body, which God has enjoined upon us, is a very good check to intemperance; for the condition upon which the rich are favored with their 			 abundance is, that they should relieve the wants of their brethren. As the prophet in this account of the divine goodness in providence makes no reference to the excesses of men, we gather from his words that it is lawful to use wine not only in cases of necessity, but also thereby to make us merry. This mirth must however be tempered with sobriety, first, that men may not forget themselves, drown their senses, and destroy their strength, but rejoice before their God, according to the 			 injunction of Moses, (<a name="xiii.iii-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040">Le 23:40</a><a name="xiii.iii-p20.1"></A>;) and, secondly, that they may exhilarate their minds under a sense of gratitude, so as to be rendered more active in the service of God. He who rejoices in this way will also be always prepared to endure sadness, whenever God is pleased to send it. That rule of Paul ought to be kept in mind, (<a name="xiii.iii-p20.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012">Php 4:12</a><a name="xiii.iii-p20.2"></A>,)</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xiii.iii-p21"></A>&#8220;I have learned to abound, &#8212; I have learned to suffer want.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiii.iii-p22"></A>If some token of the divine anger is manifest, even he who has an overflowing abundance of all kinds of dainty food, will restrict himself in his diet knowing that he is called to put on sackcloth, and to sit among ashes. Much more ought he whom poverty compels to be temperate and sober, to abstain from such delicacies. In short, if one man is constrained to abstain from wine by sickness, if another has only vapid wine, and a third nothing 			 but water, let each be content with his own lot, and willingly and submissively wean himself from those gratifications which God denies him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiii.iii-p23"></A>The same remarks apply to oil. We see from this passage that ointments were much in use among the Jews, as well as among the other eastern nations. At the present day, it is different with us, who rather keep ointments for medicinal purposes, than use them as articles of luxury. The prophet, however, says, that oil also is given to men, that they may anoint themselves therewith. But as men are too prone to pleasure, it is to be observed, 			 that the law of temperance ought not to be separated from the beneficence of God, lest they abuse their liberty by indulging in luxurious excess. This exception must always be added, that no person may take encouragement from this doctrine to licentiousness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiii.iii-p24"></A>Moreover, when men have been carefully taught to bridle their lust, it is important for them to know, that God permits them to enjoy pleasures in moderation, where there is the ability to provide them; else they will never partake even of bread and wine with a tranquil conscience; yea, they will begin to scruple about the tasting of water, at least they will never come to the table but in fearfulness. Meanwhile, the greater part of the 			 world will wallow in pleasures without discrimination, because they do not consider what God permits them; for his fatherly kindness should be to us the best mistress to teach us moderation.</p>  <a name="xiii.iv"></A>

<p><a name="xiii.iv-p9"></A><b>16.</b> <i>The trees of Jehovah shall be satiated</i> The Psalmist again treats of God&#8217;s general providence in cherishing all the parts of the world. In the first place, he asserts, that by the watering of which he had spoken the trees are satiated, or filled with sap, that thus flourishing they 			 may be a place of abode to the birds. He next declares, that the wild deer and conies have also their places of shelter, to show that no part of the world is forgotten by Him, who is the best of fathers, and that no creature is excluded from his care. The transition which the prophet makes from men to trees is as if he had said, It is not to be wondered at, if God so bountifully nourishes men who are created after his own image, since he does not grudge to extend his care even to trees. By 			 <i>the trees of the Lord, </i>is meant those which are high and of surpassing beauty; for God&#8217;s blessing is more conspicuous in them.

<p><a name="xiii.v-p7"></A><b>19.</b> <i>He hath appointed the moon to distinguish seasons</i> The Psalmist now comes to another commendation of God&#8217;s providence as manifested in the beautiful arrangement by which the course of the sun and moon alternately succeeds each other; for the diversity in their mutual changes is so far 			 from producing confusion, that all must easily perceive the impossibility of finding any better method of distinguishing time. When it is said, that the <i>moon was appointed to distinguish seasons, </i>interpreters agree that this is to be understood of the ordinary and appointed feasts. The Hebrews having been accustomed to compute their months by the moon, this served for regulating 			 their festival days and assemblies, both sacred and political.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="#fn_193"><FONT SIZE="1">194</FONT></A>
 			  The prophet, I have no doubt, by the figure synecdoche, puts a part for the whole, intimating, that the moon not only distinguishes the days from the nights, but likewise marks out the festival days, measures years and months, and, in fine, answers many useful purposes, inasmuch as the distinction of times is taken from her course. As to the sentence, The <i>sun knoweth his going down, </i>I understand it not only of his daily circuit, but as also denoting that by gradually approaching nearer us at one time, and receding farther from us at another, he knows how to regulate his movements by which to make summer, winter, spring, and autumn. It is farther stated, <i>that the beasts of the forest creep forth during the night,</i> because 			 they go out of their dens with fear. Some translate the verb <a name="xiii.v-p8.1"></A>&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;<i>, ramas, to walk; </i>but its proper signification which I have given is not unsuitable; for although hunger often drives wild beasts into fury, yet they <i>watch </i>for the darkness of the night, that they may move abroad from their hiding-places, and on account 			 of this fearfulness they are said to creep forth.</p>

<p><a name="xiii.v-p10"></A><b>21.</b> The <i>lions roar after their prey</i> Although lions, if hunger compels them, go forth from their dens and roar even at noon-day, yet the prophet describes what is most usually the case. He therefore says, that lions do not venture to go abroad during the daytime, but that, trusting to 			 the darkness of the night, they then sally forth in quest of their prey. Herein is manifested the wonderful providence of God, that a beast so dreadful confines itself within its den, that men may walk abroad with the greater freedom. And if lions sometimes range with greater liberty, this is to be imputed to the fall of Adam, which has deprived men of their dominion over the wild beasts. There are, however, still some remains of the original blessing conferred by God on men, inasmuch as he 			 holds in check so many wild beasts by the light of day, as if by iron cages or chains. The expression, <i>They seek their food from God, </i>is not to be understood of their casting themselves upon the care of God, as if they acknowledged him to be their foster-father, but it points out the fact itself, that God in a wonderful manner provides food for such ravenous beasts.</p>

<p><a name="xiii.v-p12"></A><b>22.</b> <i>The sun shall rise</i> The Psalmist continues to prosecute the same subject, showing that God so distributes the successions of time, as that the day belongs properly to man. Did not God put a restraint upon so many wild beasts which are hostile to us, the human race would soon become 			 extinct. As wild beasts since the fall of man may seem to be born to do us hurt, and to rend and tear in pieces all whom they meet with, this savage cruelty must be kept under check by the providence of God. And in order to keep them shut up within their dens, the only means which he employs is to inspire them with terror, simply by the light of the sun. This instance of divine goodness, the prophet commends the more on account of its necessity; for were it otherwise, men would have no liberty 			 to go forth to engage in the labors and business of life. Man being thus protected by the light against the violence and injuries of wild beasts, in this is to be seen the unparalleled goodness of God, who in so fatherly a manner has provided for his convenience and welfare.</p>  <a name="xiii.vi"></A>

<p><a name="xiii.vi-p6"></A><b>24.</b> <i>O Jehovah! how magnificent are thy works</i> The prophet does not make a full enumeration of the works of God, which would be an endless task, but only touches upon certain particulars, that every one may be led from the consideration of them to reflect the more attentively on that 			 wisdom by which God governs the whole world, and every particular part of it. Accordingly, breaking off his description, he exclaims with admiration, &#8212; <i>How greatly to be praised are thy works!</i> even as we then only ascribe to God due honor when seized with astonishment, we acknowledge that our tongues and all our senses fail us in doing justice to so great a subject. If a small 			 portion of the works of God make us amazed, how inadequate are our feeble minds to comprehend the whole extent of them! In the first place, it is said, <i>that God has made all things in wisdom, </i>and then it is added, <i>that the earth is full of his riches</i> The mention of 			 <i>wisdom</i> only is not intended to exclude the divine power, but the meaning is, that there is nothing in the world confused, &#8212; that, so far from this, the vast variety of things mixed together in it are arranged with the greatest wisdom, so as to render it impossible for any thing to be added, abstracted, or improved. This commendation is set in opposition to the unhallowed 			 imaginations, which often creep upon us when we are unable to discover the designs of God in his works, as if indeed he were subject to folly like ourselves, so as to be forced to bear the reprehension of those who are blind in the consideration of his works. The prophet also, by the same eulogium, reproves the madness of those who dream, that the world has been brought into its present form by chance, as Epicurus raved about the elements being composed of atoms. As it is an imagination more 			 than irrational to suppose, that a fabric so elegant, and of such surpassing embellishment, was put together by the fortuitous concourse of atoms, the prophet here bids us attend more carefully to the wisdom of God, and to that wonderful skill which shines forth in the whole government of the world. Under <i>riches </i>are comprehended the goodness and beneficence of God; for it is not on his own account that he has so richly replenished the earth but 			 on ours, that nothing which contributes to our advantage may be wanting. We ought to know that the earth does not possess such fruitfulness and riches of itself, but solely by the blessing of God, who makes it the means of administering to us his bounty.</p>

<p><a name="xiii.vi-p8"></A><b>25.</b> <i>Great is this sea, and wide in extent</i> After having treated of the evidences which the earth affords of the glory of God, the prophet goes down into the sea, and teaches us that it is a new mirror in which may be beheld the divine power and wisdom. Although the sea were not 			 inhabited by fishes, yet the mere view of its vastness would excite our wonder, especially when at one time it swells with the winds and tempests, while at another it is calm and unruffled. Again, although navigation is an art which has been acquired by the skill of men, yet it depends on the providence of God, who has granted to men a passage through the mighty deep. But the abundance and variety of fishes enhance in no small degree the glory of God in the sea. Of these the Psalmist celebrates 			 especially <i>the leviathan or the whale </i>  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_195"></A><A HREF="#fn_195"><FONT SIZE="1">196</FONT></A>
 			  because this animal, though there were no more, presents to our view a sufficient, yea, more than a sufficient, proof of the dreadful power of God, and for the same reason, we have a lengthened account of it in the book of Job. As its movements not only throw the sea into great agitation, but also strike with alarm the hearts of men, the prophet, by the word <i>sport, </i>intimates that these its movements are only sport in respect of God; as if he had said, The sea is given to the leviathans, as a field in which to exercise themselves.</p>  <a name="xiii.vii"></A>

<p><a name="xiii.vii-p6"></A><b>27.</b> <i>All these wait upon thee</i> The prophet here again describes God as acting the part of the master of a household, and a foster-father towards all sorts of living creatures, by providing liberally for them. He had said before, that God made food to grow on the mountains for the 			 support of cattle, and that sustenance is ministered to the very lions by the hand of the same God, although they live upon prey. Now he amplifies this wonder of the divine beneficence by an additional circumstance. While the different species of living creatures are almost innumerable, and the number in each species is so great, there is yet not one of them which does not stand in need of daily food. The meaning then of the expression, <i>All 			 things wait upon thee, </i>is, that they could not continue in existence even for a few days, unless God were to supply their daily need, and to nourish each of them in particular. We thus see why there is so great a diversity of fruits; for God assigns and appoints to each species of living creatures the food suitable and proper for them. The brute beasts are not indeed endued with reason and judgment to seek the supply of their wants 			 from God, but stooping towards the earth, they seek to fill themselves with food; still the prophet speaks with propriety, when he represents them as waiting upon God; for their hunger must be relieved by his bounty, else they would soon die. Nor is the specification of <i>the season</i> when God furnishes them with food superfluous, since God lays up in store for them, that they may 			 have the means of sustenance during the whole course of the year. As the earth in winter shuts up her bowels, what would become of them if he did not provide them with food for a long time? The miracle, then, is the greater from the circumstance, that God, by making the earth fruitful at stated seasons, extends in this way his blessing to the rest of the year which threatens us with hunger and famine. How wretched would we be when the earth in winter shuts up her riches, were not our hearts 			 cheered with the hope of a new increase? In this sense, the Psalmist appropriately affirms, that God <i>opens his hand</i> If wheat should grow up daily, God&#8217;s providence would not be so manifest. But when the earth becomes barren, it is as if God shut his hand. Whence it follows, that when he makes it fruitful, he, so to speak, stretches out his hand from heaven to give us food. Now 			 if he supply wild and brute beasts with sustenance in due season, by which they are fed to the full, his blessing will doubtless be to us as an inexhaustible source of plenty, provided we ourselves do not hinder it from flowing to us by our unbelief.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.vii-p7"></A><a name="xiii.vii-p7.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiii.vii-p8"></A><b>29</b>  <i>Thou shalt hide thy face, and they shall be afraid</i> In these words, the Psalmist declares, that we stand or fall according to the will of God. We continue to live, so long as he sustains us by his power; but no sooner does he withdraw his life-giving 			 spirit than we die. Even Plato knew this, who so often teaches that, properly speaking, there is but one God, and that all things subsist, or have their being only in him. Nor do I doubt, that it was the will of God, by means of that heathen writer, to awaken all men to the knowledge, that they derive their life from another source than from themselves. In the first place, the Psalmist asserts, that <i>if God hide his face they are 			 afraid; </i>and, secondly, that <i>if he take away their spirit they die, and return to their dust; </i>by which words he points out, that when God vouchsafes to look upon us, that look gives us life, and that as long as his serene countenance shines, it inspires all the creatures with life. Our blindness then is doubly 			 inexcusable, if we do not on our part cast our eyes upon that goodness which gives life to the whole world. The prophet describes step by step the destruction of living creatures, upon God&#8217;s withdrawing from them his secret energy, that from the contrast he may the better commend that continued inspiration, by which all things are maintained in life and rigor. He could have gone farther, and have asserted, that all things, unless upheld in being by God, would return to nothing; but he was 			 content with affirming in general and popular language, that whatever is not cherished by Him falls into corruption. He again declares, that the world is daily <i>renewed, </i>because <i>God sends forth his spirit</i> In the propagation of living creatures, we doubtless see continually a new creation of the world. In now calling <i>that </i>God&#8217;s spirit, which he before represented as the spirit of living creatures, there is no contradiction. God sendeth forth that spirit which remains with him whither he pleases; and as soon as he has sent it forth, all things are created. In this way, what was his own he makes to be ours. But this gives no countenance to the old dream of the Manicheeans, which that filthy dog Servetus has made still worse 			 in our own day. The Manicheeans said that the soul of man is a particle of the Divine Spirit, and is propagated from it as the shoot of a tree; but this base man has had the audacity to assert, that oxen, asses, and dogs, are parts of the divine essence. The Manichees at least had this pretext for their error, that the soul was created after the image of God; but to maintain this with respect to swine and cattle, is in the highest degree monstrous and detestable. Nothing was farther from the 			 prophet&#8217;s intention, than to divide the <i>spirit of God</i> into parts, so that a portion of it should dwell essentially in every living creature. But he termed that the <i>spirit of God</i> which proceeds from him. By the way, he instructs us, that it is ours, because it is 			 given us, that it may quicken us. The amount of what is stated is, that when we see the world daily decaying, and daily renewed, the life-giving power of God is reflected to us herein as in a mirror. All the deaths which take place among living creatures, are just so many examples of our nothingness, so to speak; and when others are produced and grow up in their room, we have in that presented to us a renewal of the world. Since then the world daily dies, and is daily renewed in its various 			 parts, the manifest conclusion is, that it subsists only by a secret virtue derived from God.</p>  <a name="xiii.viii"></A>

<p><a name="xiii.viii-p9"></A><b>31.</b> <i>Glory be to Jehovah for ever</i> The inspired writer shows for what purpose he has celebrated in the preceding part of the psalm the power, wisdom, and goodness of God in his works, namely, to stir up men to praise him. It is no small honor that God for our sake has so 			 magnificently adorned the world, in order that we may not only be spectators of this beauteous theater, but also enjoy the multiplied abundance and variety of good things which are presented to us in it. Our gratitude in yielding to God the praise which is his due, is regarded by him as a singular recompense. What the Psalmist adds, <i>Let Jehovah rejoice in his works, </i>is not 			 superfluous; for he desires that the order which God has established from the beginning may be continued in the lawful use of his gifts. As we read in <a name="xiii.viii-p9.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006">Ge 6:6</a><a name="xiii.viii-p9.1"></A>, that &#8220;it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth,&#8221; so when he sees that the good things which he bestows are polluted by our corruptions, he ceases to take delight in bestowing them. And certainly the confusion and 			 disorder which take place, when the elements cease to perform their office, testify that God, displeased and wearied out, is provoked to discontinue, and put a stop to the regular course of his beneficence; although anger and impatience have strictly speaking no place in his mind. What is here taught is, that he bears the character of the best of fathers, who takes pleasure in tenderly cherishing his children, and in bountifully nourishing them. In the following verse it is shown, that the 			 stability of the world depends on this rejoicing of God in his works; for did he not give vigor to the earth by his gracious and fatherly regard, as soon as he looked upon it with a severe countenance, he would make it tremble, and would burn up the very mountains.</p>

<p><a name="xiii.viii-p11"></A><b>33.</b> <i>I will sing to Jehovah whilst I live</i> Here the Psalmist points out to others their duty by his own example, declaring, that throughout the whole course of his life he will proclaim the praises of God without ever growing weary of that exercise. The only boundary which he fixes 			 to the celebration of God&#8217;s praises is death; not that the saints, when they pass from this world into another state of existence, desist from this religious duty, but because the end for which we are created is, that the divine name may be celebrated by us on the earth. Conscious of his unworthiness to offer to God so precious a sacrifice, he humbly prays, (verse 34,) <i>that the praises which he will sing to God may be acceptable to him, </i>although 			 they proceed from polluted lips. It is true, that there is nothing more acceptable to God, nor any thing of which he more approves, than the publication of his praises, even as there is no service which he more peculiarly requires us to perform. But as our uncleanness defiles that which in its own nature is most holy, the prophet with good reason betakes himself to the goodness of God, and on this ground alone pleads that He would accept of his song of praise. Accordingly, the Apostle, in 			 <a name="xiii.viii-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015">Heb 13:15</a><a name="xiii.viii-p11.1"></A> teaches that our sacrifices of thanksgiving are well pleasing to God, when they are offered to him through Christ. It being however the case, that whilst all men indiscriminately enjoy the benefits of God, there are yet very few who look to the author of them, the prophet subjoins the clause, <i>I will rejoice in 			 the Lord; </i>intimating, that this is a rare virtue; for nothing is more difficult than to call home the mind from those wild and erratic joys, which disperse themselves through heaven and earth in which they evanish, that it may keep itself fixed on God alone.</p>

<p><a name="xiii.viii-p13"></A><b>35.</b> <i>Let sinners perish from the earth</i> This imprecation depends on the last clause of the 31st verse, <i>Let Jehovah rejoice in his works</i> As the wicked infect the 			 world with their pollutions, the consequence is, that God has less delight in his own workmanship, and is even almost displeased with it. It is impossible, but that this uncleanness, which, being extended and diffused through every part of the world, vitiates and corrupts such a noble product of his hands, must be offensive to him. Since then the wicked, by their perverse abuse of God&#8217;s gifts, cause the world in a manner to degenerate and fall away from its first original, the prophet justly 			 desires that they may be exterminated, until the race of them entirely fail. Let us then take care so to weigh the providence of God, as that being wholly devoted to obeying him, we may rightly and purely use the benefits which he sanctities for our enjoying them. Farther, let us be grieved, that such precious treasures are wickedly squandered away, and let us regard it as monstrous and detestable, that men not only forget their Maker, but also, as it were, purposely turn to a perverse and an 			 unworthy end, whatever good things he has bestowed upon them.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xiii-p3"></A> &#8220;For regularity of composition, richness of imagery, sublimity of sentiment, and elegance and perspicuity of diction, this hymn is perhaps the principal poem in the whole collection of these inspired songs. As there is no allusion in it to the Mosaic ritual, nor any mention of the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt, it should seem that it was of an earlier age than the Exodus. It consists of parts sung alternately by 				two companies. The parts are easily distinguished, inasmuch as one Semichorus always speaks of God in the third person, the other addresses him in the second.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Horsley.</i></p> 		  </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xiii.i-p3"></A> &#8220;It is a singular circumstance,&#8221; says Horsley, &#8220;in the composition of this psalm, that each of the parts of the First Semichorus after the first, [that is, verses 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 13, 14, 19,] begins with a participle. And these participles are accusatives, agreeing with <a name="xiii.i-p3.1"></A>&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, the object of the verb <a name="xiii.i-p3.2"></A>&#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;, at the beginning of the whole psalm. Bless Jehovah &#8212; putting on &#8212; extending &#8212; laying &#8212; constituting &#8212; travelling &#8212; making &#8212; setting &#8212; sending &#8212; watering &#8212; making &#8212; making. Thus, this transitive verb, in the opening of the psalm, extending its government through the successive parts of the same semichorus, except the last, unites them all in one long period. As this singular artifice of composition 						seems to be the characteristic of a particular species of ode, in this psalm, I have scrupulously conformed to it in my translation, at the expense of the elegance of my English style.&#8221; Calvin, for the most part, translates these words as participles, but in the nominative case.</p> 				  </P>

The evening they rest in trees.&#8221; This account is confirmed by Dr Shaw, who informs us, that as he lay at anchor near Mount Carmel, he saw &#8220;three flights of them, some of which were more open and scattered, with larger intervals between them; others were closer and more compact, as in the flight of wrens and other birds, 						each of which took up more than three hours in passing by us, extending itself at the same time more than half a mile in breadth.&#8221; &#8212; See his <i>Travels, </i>volume 2, page 269. The stork constructs her nest with exquisite skill of dry twigs of trees and coarse grass from the marsh. But instead of confining herself to one situation, she builds it sometimes on the highest parts of old ruins and houses, &#8212; sometimes in the canals of ancient aqueducts, and 						sometimes on the tops of the eastern mosques and dwelling-houses; so very familiar is she by being never molested, the Mahometans accounting it profane to kill, or even to hurt, or disturb this species of bird, because of their important services in clearing the country of serpents, and other venomous animals, on which they feed. She frequently retires from the noise and bustle of the town to the adjacent field, selecting the highest tree of the forest on which to build her nest, and always 						preferring the fir, when it is equally suitable to her purpose  &#8212; <i>Ibid. </i>volume 2, page 272.

He farther observes, that Aquila, who has given us an ancient Greek 						translation of the Old Testament, and who is said to have been exquisitely skilled in the original language, always understood the <i>chasidah </i>to mean <i>the heron, </i>rather than <i>the stork. </i>&#8220;But,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;the two species resemble each other so much, that it is not improbable but one Hebrew word stood for both,&#8221; and refers to Doubdan, who supposes that 						storks in Palestine roost in trees  &#8212; <i>Harmer</i>&#8217;<i>s Observations, </i>volume 2, page 465, and volume 3, page 338.</p> 				  </P>

To this circumstance allusion is here made; and it is also referred to by Solomon, (<a name="xiii.iv-p6.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#026">Pr 30:26</a><a name="xiii.iv-p6.5"></A>) &#8220;The shaphans are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks.&#8221; It is evident from these 						words, that the shaphan is gregarious. What particular animal then is indicated by this name? Calvin, from giving the original term, one translation in the text, and a different one on the margin, seems to have been uncertain as to the species of animal intended, and on this point considerable variety of opinion has obtained. Some copies of the Septuagint have <i>hedgehogs, </i>and others, <i>hares, </i>the 						former being probably the right reading, as the Vulgate agrees with it. Bochart supposed the<i> jerboa, </i>or <i>jumping-mouse, </i>to be meant. But to this it has been justly objected, that the jerboa always digs its habitation in the smoother places of the desert, especially where the soil is fixed gravel; that it is not gregarious, nor distinguished by feebleness, which it supplies by its wisdom. Nor can 						it be the coney, or rabbit, that is here referred to; for, instead of seeking a habitation among the rocks, it delights to burrow in the sandy downs; and if it sometimes digs a place of shelter among the rocks, it is only where the openings are filled with earth. It is now pretty generally agreed, that <i>the shaphan </i>is the <i>Daman Israel, </i>as suggested by Dr Shaw. &#8220;The Daman Israel,&#8221; says this 						traveler, &#8220;is an animal likewise of Mount Lebanus, though common in other places of this country. It is a harmless creature, of the same size and quality with the rabbit, and with the like incurvating posture and disposition of the fore-teeth. But it is of a browner color with smaller eyes, and a head more pointed, like the marmots. The fore-feet likewise are short, and the hinder are nearly as long in proportion as those of the jerboa. Though this animal is known to burrow sometimes in the 						ground, yet as its usual residence and refuge is in the holes and clifts of the rocks, we have so far a more presumptive proof, that this creature may be the shaphan of the Scriptures, than the jerboa. I could not learn why it was called <i>Daman Israel, i.e., Israel</i>&#8217;<i>s lamb, </i>as those words are interpreted.&#8221; Travels, volume 2, pages 160, 161. It is called in Amhara, &#8220;Ashkoko.&#8221; Bruce confirms Dr 						Shaw&#8217;s opinion. He identifies the animals by the several other particulars mentioned in Scripture, as well as by their attachment to rocks, and their constant residence in holes and caves, as noticed in this psalm. See also Paxton&#8217;s Illustrations of Scripture, volume 2, pages 204-209.</p> 				  </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xiii.v-p3"></A> &#8220;What is here said of the <i>lions </i>peculiarly, that they &#8216;roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God,&#8217; may be illustrated by what is observed of those creatures, that to their great strength and greediness and rapacity, they are not proportionably provided with swiftness of body to pursue in the desert those beasts on which they prey, nor yet so quick-scented, as to be able to follow and trace them to their places of repose. It 						hath therefore been necessary to the providing for these animals, that some supply should be made to these defects by some other way. And it hath been affirmed by some, that their very <i>roaring </i>is useful to them for this end, and that when they cannot overtake their prey, they do by that fierce noise so astonish and amaze the poor beasts, that they fall down before them. If this have that truth, which it professes to have, it gives a clear account both of the phrase of <i>roaring after 						their prey, </i>and of <i>seeking it </i>from God &#8212; of<i> roaring, </i>as being able to do nothing else toward the getting it, but only thus to frighten the hearers, and express his own hunger and want.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Hammond.</i></p> 				  </P>
