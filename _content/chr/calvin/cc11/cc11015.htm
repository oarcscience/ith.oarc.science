<p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN18"><a name="xvi-p1"></A>PSALM 107</p>  		
<p><a name="xvi-p2"></A>The Psalmist teaches us, in the first place, that human affairs are not regulated by the fickle and uncertain wheel of fortune, but that we must observe the judgments of God in the different vicissitudes which occur in the world, and which men imagine happen by chance. Consequently, adversity and all the ills which mankind endure, as shipwrecks, famines, banishments, diseases, and disasters in war, are to be regarded as so many tokens of God&#8217;s 		  displeasure, by which he summons them, on account of their sins, before his judicial throne. But prosperity, and the happy issue of events, ought also to be attributed to his grace, in order that he may always receive the praise which he deserves, that of being a merciful Father, and an impartial Judge. About the close of the psalm, he inveighs against those ungodly men who will not acknowledge God&#8217;s hand, amid such palpable demonstrations of his providence.  		  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_271"></A><A HREF="#fn_271"><FONT SIZE="1">272</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xvi.i-p9"></A><b>1</b>  <i>Praise Jehovah.</i> We have already explained this verse, for it formed the commencement of the preceding psalm. And it appears that it was not only frequently used among the Jews, but also so incorporated with other psalms, that when one part of the chorus on the 			 one side was singing a portion of the psalm, the other part of the chorus on the opposite side in its turn, after each succeeding verse, responded, <i>Praise Jehovah, because he is good, etc</i> The penman of this psalm, whoever he was, has, instead of the ordinary preface, inserted this beautiful sentiment, in which praise and thanksgiving to God were so frequently expressed by the 			 Israelitish Church. Immediately he proceeds to speak more particularly. And first, he exhorts those to offer up a tribute of gratitude to God; who, after having been delivered from slavery and imprisonment, and after a long and painful journey, arrived in safety at their place of abode. These he calls<i> the redeemed of God;</i> because, in wandering through the trackless desert, and 			 howling wilderness, they many a time would have been prevented from returning home, had not God, as it were, with his outstretched hand, appeared as their guard and their guide. He does not here refer to travelers indiscriminately, but to such as either by hostile power, or by any other kind of violence, or by stern necessity, having been banished to distant regions, felt themselves to be in the midst of imminent dangers; or it may be, that he refers to those who had been made prisoners by 			 enemies, pirates, or other robbers. He reminds them that it was by no casual occurrence that they had been driven about in that manner, and had been brought back to their native country, but that all their wanderings had been under the superintending providence of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p10"></A>But the second verse might be conjoined with the first, as if the prophet were commanding the persons whom he was addressing to sing this celebrated ode. It may with equal propriety be read by itself thus: Let the redeemed of Jehovah, who have returned from captivity to their own land, come forth now, and take part in the celebration of God&#8217;s praises, and let them publish his loving-kindness which they have experienced in their deliverance. 			 Among the Jews, who had occasion to undertake extensive journeys, such occurrences as these were very common; because they could hardly leave their own land, without from all quarters encountering ways rugged, and difficult, and perilous; and the same observation is equally applicable to mankind in general. He reminds them how often they wandered and turned aside from the right way, and found no place of shelter; a thing by no means rare in these lonely deserts. Were a person to enter a forest 			 without any knowledge of the proper direction, he would, in the course of his wandering, be in danger of becoming the prey of lions and wolves. He has, however, particularly in his eye those who, finding themselves unexpectedly in desert places, are also in danger of perishing for hunger and thirst. For it is certain that such persons are hourly in hazard of death, unless the Lord come to their rescue.</p>

<p><a name="xvi.i-p12"></A><b>6</b> <i> In their straits they called upon Jehovah</i> The verbs are here in the past tense, and according to grammarians, represent a continued action. The meaning therefore is, that those who are wandering in desert places are often pinched with hunger and thirst in consequence of finding no 			 place in which to lodge; and who, when all hope of deliverance fails them, then cry unto God. Doubtless, God grants deliverance to many when in straits, even though they do not present their supplications to Him for aid; and hence it was not so much the design of the prophet in this passage to extol the faith of the pious, who call upon God with all their heart, as to describe the common feelings of humanity. There may be not a few whose hope does not center on God, who, nevertheless, are 			 constrained, by some invisible disposition of mind, to come to Him, when under the pressure of dire necessity. And this is the plan which God sometimes pursues, in order to extort from such persons the acknowledgement that deliverance is to be sought for from no other quarter than from Himself alone; and even the ungodly, who, while living voluptuously, scoff at Him, he constrains, in spite of themselves, to invoke his name. It has been customary in all ages for heathens, who look upon religion 			 as a fable, when compelled by stern necessity, to call upon God for help. Did they do so in jest? By no means; it was by a secret natural instinct that they were led to reverence God&#8217;s name, which formerly they held in derision. The Spirit of God, therefore, in my opinion, here narrates what frequently takes place, namely, that persons destitute of piety and faith, and who have no desire to have any thing to do with God, if placed in perilous circumstances, are constrained by natural instinct, 			 and without any proper conception of what they are doing, to call on the name of God. Since it is only in dubious and desperate cases that they betake themselves to God, this acknowledgement which they make of their helplessness is a palpable proof of their stupidity, that in the season of peace and tranquillity they neglect him, so much are they then under the intoxicating influence of their own prosperity; and notwithstanding that the germ of piety is planted in their hearts, they 			 nevertheless never dream of learning wisdom, unless when driven by the dint of adversity; I mean, to learn the wisdom of acknowledging that there is a God in heaven who directs every event. It is unnecessary to allude here to the sarcastic retort of the ancient buffoon, who, on entering a temple, and beholding a number of tablets which several merchants had suspended there as memorials of their having escaped shipwreck, through the kind interposition of the gods, smartly and facetiously 			 remarked, &#8220;But the deaths of those who have been drowned are not enumerated, the number of which is innumerable.&#8221; Perhaps he might have some just cause for scoffing in this manner at such idols. But even if a hundredfold more were drowned in the sea than safely reach the harbour, this does not in the least degree detract from the glory of the goodness of God, who, while he is merciful, is at the same time also just, so that the dispensing of the one does not interfere with the exercise of the 			 other. The same observation applies to travelers that stray from the path, and wander up and down in the desert. If many of them perish for hunger and thirst, if many are devoured by wild animals, if many die from cold, these are nothing else than so many tokens of the judgments of God, which he designs for our consideration. From which we infer that the same thing would happen to all men, were it not the will of God to save a portion of them; and thus interposing as a judge between them, he 			 preserves some for the sake of showing his mercy, and pours out his judgments upon others to declare his justice. The prophet, therefore, very properly adds, that by the hand of God they were led into the <i>right way, where they may find a suitable place for lodging;</i> and consequently he exhorts them to render thanks to God for this manifestation of his goodness. And with the view of 			 enhancing the loving-kindness of God, he connects <i>his wondrous works</i> with his mercy; as if he should say, in this kind interposition, God&#8217;s grace is too manifest, either to be unperceived or unacknowledged by all; and for those who have been the subjects of such a remarkable deliverance, to remain silent regarding it, would be nothing less than an impious attempt to suppress the 			 wonderful doings of God, an attempt equally vain with that of endeavoring to trample under their feet the light of the sun. For what else can be said of us, seeing that our natural instinct drives us to God for help, when we are in perplexity and peril; and when, after being rescued, we forthwith forget him, who will deny that his glory is, as it were, obscured by our wickedness and ingratitude?</p>  <a name="xvi.ii"></A>

<p><a name="xvi.ii-p6"></A><b>10.</b> <i>They who dwell in darkness</i> The Spirit of God makes mention here of another species of danger in which God manifestly discovers his power and grace in the protecting and delivering of men. The world, as I said, calls these vicissitudes the sport of fortune; and hardly one among a 			 hundred can be found who ascribes them to the superintending providence of God. It is a very different kind of practical wisdom which God expects at our hands; namely, that we ought to meditate on his judgments in the time of adversity, and on his goodness in delivering us from it. For surely it is not by mere chance that a person falls into the hands of enemies or robbers; neither is it by chance that he is rescued from them. But this is what we must constantly keep in view, that all 			 afflictions are God&#8217;s rod, and that therefore there is no remedy for them elsewhere than in his grace. If a person fall into the hands of robbers or pirates, and be not instantly murdered, but, giving up all hope of life, expects death every moment; surely the deliverance of such a one is a striking proof of the grace of God, which shines the more illustriously in proportion to the fewness of the number who make their escape. Thus, then, should a great number perish, this circumstance ought by 			 no means to diminish the praises of God. On this account the prophet charges all those with ingratitude, who, after they have been wonderfully preserved, very soon lose sight of the deliverance thus vouchsafed to them. And, to strengthen the charge, he brings forward, as a testimony against them, their sighs and cries. For when they are in straits, they confess in good earnest that God is their deliverer; how happens it, then, that this confession disappears when they are enjoying peace and 			 quietness?</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.ii-p7"></A><a name="xvi.ii-p7.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p8"></A><b>11.</b> <i>Because they rebelled</i> In assigning the cause of their afflictions he corrects the false impressions of those persons who imagine that these happen by chance. Were they to reflect on the judgments of God, they would at once perceive that there was nothing like chance or fortune in the 			 government of the world. Moreover, until men are persuaded that all their troubles come upon them by the appointment of God, it will never come into their minds to supplicate him for deliverance. Farther, when the prophet assigns the reason for their afflictions, he is not to be regarded as speaking of those persons as if they were notoriously wicked, but he is to be considered as calling upon the afflicted carefully to examine some particular parts of their life, and although no one accuse 			 them, to look into their hearts, where they will always discover the true origin of all the miseries which overtake them. Nor does he only charge them with having merely sinned, but with having rebelled against the word of God, thus intimating that the best and only regulation for our lives consists in yielding a prompt obedience to his commandments. When, therefore, sheer necessity compels those who are in this manner convicted to cry unto God, they must be insensate indeed, if they do not 			 acknowledge that the deliverance which, contrary to their expectation, they receive, comes immediately from God. For brazen gates and iron bars are spoken of for the purpose of enhancing the benefit; as if he said, the chains of perpetual slavery have been broken asunder.</p>  <a name="xvi.iii"></A>

<p><a name="xvi.iii-p7"></A><b>17</b> <i> Fools are afflicted on account of the way of their transgression.</i> He comes to another species of chastisement. For as he observed above, that those were given over to captivity who refused to yield obedience to God, so now he teaches that others have been visited by God with 			 disease, as the fruit of their transgressions. And when the transgressor shall find that it is God who is administering correction to him, this will pave the way for his arriving at the knowledge of his grace.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.iii-p8"></A>He denominates those <i>fools, </i>who, thoughtlessly giving themselves up to sensuality, bring destruction upon themselves. The sin which they commit is not the result of ignorance and error only, but of their carnal affections, which depriving them of proper understanding, cause them to devise things detrimental to 			 themselves. The maxim, that the fear of God is wisdom, must never be lost sight of. Hence it plainly follows, that they who shake off the yoke of God, and surrender themselves to Satan and sin, are the victims of their own folly and fury. And as constituting a principal ingredient of this madness, the prophet employs the term <i>deletion </i>or <i>transgression; 			 </i>and subsequently he adds <i>iniquities;</i> because it happens that when once a man departs from God, from that moment he loses all self-control, and falls from one sin into another. But it is not of the distempers which commonly prevail in the world to which a reference is made in this passage, but to those which are deemed fatal, and in which all hope of life 			 is abandoned, so that the grace of God becomes the more conspicuous when deliverance from them is obtained. When a man recovers from a slight indisposition, he does not so plainly discern the effects of God&#8217;s power, as when it is put forth in a wonderful and notable manner to bring back some from the gates of death, and restores them to their wonted health and rigour. He says, therefore, that they are preserved from many <i>corruptions, </i>which is 			 equivalent to his saying, that they are delivered from as many deaths. To this purport are the following words of the prophet, in which he says, <i>that they approach the gates of death, and that they loathe all food</i> We have already adverted to their calling upon God, namely, that when men are reduced to the greatest straits, they, by thus calling upon God for aid, acknowledge that 			 they would be undone unless he wonderfully interposed for their deliverance.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.iii-p9"></A><a name="xvi.iii-p9.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.iii-p10"></A><b>20</b>  <i>He sendeth his word.</i> Again, in saying that they are delivered from destruction, the prophet shows that he is here alluding to those diseases which, in the opinion of men, are incurable, and from which few are delivered. Besides, he contrasts God&#8217;s 			 assistance with all the remedies which are in the power of man to apply; as if he should say, that their disease having baffled the skill of earthly physicians, their recovery has been entirely owing to the exertion of God&#8217;s power. It is proper also to notice the manner in which their recovery is effected; God has but to will it, or to speak the word, and instantly all diseases, and even death itself, are expelled. I do not regard this as exclusively referring to the faithful, as many 			 expositors do. I own, indeed, that it is of comparatively little consequence to us to be the subjects of bodily care, if our souls still remain unsanctified by the word of God; and hence it is the intention of the prophet that we consider the mercy of God as extending to the evil and unthankful. The meaning of the passage, therefore, is, that diseases neither come upon us by chance, nor are to be ascribed to natural causes alone, but are to be viewed as God&#8217;s messengers executing his commands; 			 so that we must believe that the same person that sent them can easily remove them, and for this purpose he has only to speak the word. And since we now perceive the drift of the passage, we ought to attend to the very appropriate analogy contained in it. Corporeal maladies are not removed except by the word or command of God, much less are men&#8217;s souls restored to the enjoyment of spiritual life, except this word be apprehended by faith.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.iii-p11"></A><a name="xvi.iii-p11.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.iii-p12"></A><i>And let them sacrifice</i> This clause is subjoined by way of explanation, the more strongly to express how God is robbed of his due, if in the matter of sacrifice his providence be not recognised. Even nature itself teaches that some kind of homage and reverence is due to God; this is acknowledged by the heathens themselves, who have 			 no other instructor than nature. We know too, that the practice of offering sacrifices has obtained among all nations; and doubtless it was by the observance of this ritual, that God designed to preserve in the human family some sense of piety and religion. To acknowledge the bounty and beneficence of God, is the most acceptable sacrifice which can be presented to him; to this subject, therefore, the prophet intends to recall the attention of the insensate and indifferent portion of men. I do 			 not deny that there may be also an allusion to the ceremonial law; but inasmuch as in the world at large sacrifices formed part of the religious exercises, he charges those with ingratitude, who, after having escaped from some imminent peril, forget to celebrate the praises of their Great Deliverer.</p>  <a name="xvi.iv"></A>

<p><a name="xvi.iv-p9"></A><b>23.</b> <i>They that go down to the sea in ships</i> Here we have another instance of God&#8217;s superintending care towards mankind pointed out to us by the prophet, exemplified in the bringing of those who are shipwrecked to the harbour, and this, too, as if he had raised them from the depth and 			 darkness of the tomb, and brought them to live in the light of day. I do not understand what is here said about those who are accustomed to navigate the ocean <i>seeing the wonders of God, </i>as referring generally to the many wonderful things with which it abounds. Such persons are well fitted to bear testimony regarding the works of God, because they there behold more vast and various 			 wonders than are to be seen upon earth. But it appears to me preferable to connect this with the subsequent context, where the prophet is his own interpreter, and where he shows how suddenly God raises and calms the tempest.</p>  		  
<p class="Super"><a name="xvi.iv-p10"></A>The sum of the matter is, that the scope of the passage is to point out that the lives of those who navigate the seas are often in great jeopardy by the storms which they encounter; because, as often as the ocean heaves and is agitated, and the billows rise and rage, so often does death stare them in the face. But he furnishes us with a still more vivid picture of the providence of God; for in telling us, that the sea does 			 not of its own accord rise into a tempest, he makes use of the verb, <i>he speaks, </i>intimating that the word and providence of God make the winds blow, to agitate the sea. True, indeed, the mariners imagine from certain phenomena, that a storm is approaching, but sudden changes proceed only from the secret appointment of God. Therefore, he gives not merely a historical narrative of 			 the manner in which squalls and storms arise, but, assuming the character of a teacher, begins with the cause itself, and then directs to the imminent danger with which the tempest is fraught; or rather, portrays, as in a picture, the image of death, in order that the goodness of God may appear the more conspicuous when the tempest happily ceases without any loss of life. They<i> mount up,</i> says he,<i> to the heavens, they descend into the deeps;</i> as if he should say, they mount up into the air, so that their life may be destroyed, and then they tumble down towards the caverns of the ocean, where they may be drowned.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_283"></A><A HREF="#fn_283"><FONT SIZE="1">284</FONT></A>
 			  Next, he mentions the fears which torment them, or rather which may deprive them of understanding; intimating by these words, that however skilfully mariners may steer their vessels, they may happen to be deprived of their senses; and being thus paralysed, they could not avail themselves of aid, were it even at hand. For though they collect all their tackling, cast their sounding line into the deep, and unfurl their sails to all points, yet after making every 			 attempt, and all human skill is baffled, they give themselves up to the mercy of wind and wave. All hope of safety being cut off, no farther means are employed by them. And now that all human aid fails, they cry unto God for deliverance, which is a convincing evidence that they had been as it were dead.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_284"></A><A HREF="#fn_284"><FONT SIZE="1">285</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xvi.iv-p19"></A><b>29.</b> <i>He maketh the storm a calm</i> A profane author, in narrating the history of such an event, would have said, that the winds were hushed, and the raging billows were calmed; but the Spirit of God, by this change of the storm into a calm, places the providence of God as presiding over 			 all; thereby meaning, that it was not by human agency that this violent commotion of the sea and wind, which threatened to subvert the frame of the world, was so suddenly stilled. When, therefore, the sea is agitated, and boils up in terrific fury, as if wave were contending with wave, whence is it that instantly it is calm and peaceful, but that God restrains the raging of the billows, the contention of which was so awful, and makes the bosom of the deep as smooth as a mirror?   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_285"></A><A HREF="#fn_285"><FONT SIZE="1">286</FONT></A>
 			  Having spoken of their great terror, he proceeds next to mention <i>their joy,</i> so that their ingratitude may appear the more striking, if they forget their remarkable deliverance. For they are not in want of a monitor, having been abundantly instructed by the storm itself, and by the calm which ensued, that their lives were in the hand and under the 			 protection of God. Moreover, he informs them that this is a species of gratitude which deserves not only to be acknowledged privately, or to be mentioned in the family, but that it should be praised and magnified in all places, even in the great assemblies. He makes specific mention of <i>the elders, </i>intimating that the more wisdom and experience a person has, the more capable is he 			 of listening to, and being a witness of, these praises.</p>  <a name="xvi.v"></A>

<p><a name="xvi.v-p7"></A><b>33.</b> <i>He turneth rivers into a wilderness</i> Here then is an account of changes which it would be the height of folly to attribute to chance. Fruitful lands become unfruitful, and barren lands assume the new aspect of freshness and fruitfulness. And how happens it that one district becomes 			 sterile, and another becomes fat and fertile, contrary to what they were wont to be, but because that God pours out his wrath upon the inhabitants of the one, by taking his blessing from them, and renders the other fruitful to feed the hungry? It may be ascribed to the thinness of the population, that many parts of Asia and Greece, once exceedingly fruitful, now lie uncultivated and unproductive; but we must ascribe to the providence of God, which the prophet praises, the well authenticated 			 fact, that in some places the earth that was fruitful has now become barren and parched, while others are beginning to be fertile.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.v-p8"></A>It is, however, not sufficient merely to observe, that these wonderful revolutions of the surface of the earth are the result of God&#8217;s overruling purpose, unless we also observe, in the second place, what the prophet does not omit, that the earth is cursed by him on account of the iniquity of its inhabitants, who prove themselves to be undeserving of being so amply sustained by his bountiful hand. He has 			 put <i>pools and springs of water</i> for fields or countries where there is an abundance of water; because moisture is required to nourish the plants by which fruit is produced. The term <i>saltness </i>is employed metaphorically, inasmuch as there is nothing more sterile than salt; hence that 			 saying of Christ&#8217;s,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvi.v-p9"></A>&#8220;If the salt have lost its saltness, what further purpose will it serve?&#8221;<br> 			 <a name="xvi.v-p9.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050">Mr 9:50</a><a name="xvi.v-p9.2"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.v-p10"></A>not even indeed for barrenness. And, consequently, when men designed to doom any place to remain unproductive, they usually sowed it with salt. And probably it is in allusion to this ancient custom, that the prophet says that the land was covered with salt.</p>

<p><a name="xvi.v-p12"></A><b>35.</b> <i>He turneth the desert into a pool of water</i> This change, in contrast with the former, places the miraculous power of God in a more luminous position. Because, were the fields ceasing to be so productive as in former times, men of the world, as was common of old, would attribute this 			 to the frequent crops which exhausted their productive power. But whence is it that parched grounds become so fruitful, that one would almost say that the atmosphere, as well as the nature of the soil, had undergone a change, unless it be that God hath there put forth a wonderful display of his power and goodness? Wherefore, the prophet very justly says, that the <i>deserts were turned into pools of water, 			 </i>so that populous cities may rise up in waste and uncultivated places, where once there was not a single cottage. For it is as improbable that the nature of the soil is changed, as that the course of the sun and stars is changed. The clause, <i>the hungry are filled, </i>may mean, either that they themselves, after considerable privations, have got what may supply 			 their need, or that those poor persons, living in a country where they cannot longer find daily bread, being constrained to leave it, and to seek a new place of abode, are there bountifully supplied by God. I am rather disposed to think, that this clause refers to what frequently occurs, namely, that the famishing, whose wants the world refuses to supply, and who are expatriated, are comfortably accommodated in these desert places, where God blesses them with abundance. The passage which I have 			 translated,<i> fruit of the increase,</i> is, by not a few Hebrew expositors, considered as a repetition of two synonymous terms, and are for supplying a copulative conjunction, making it, <i>fruit and increase</i> But it was rather the intention of the prophet to refer to fruit 			 yielded annually; as if he said, the fertility of these regions is not temporary, or only for a few years, it is perennial. For <a name="xvi.v-p12.1"></A>&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;<i>, tebuaoth, </i>is the term which, in the Hebrew, denotes full-grown fruit annually produced by the earth. And when he says, that the <i>new settlers sow and plant, </i>he gives us to understand, that, prior to their arrival, cultivation was unknown in these places, and, consequently, in becoming so unusually fertile, they assumed a totally different aspect. And, in fine, he adds, that it was entirely owing to the Divine blessing that those who were once oppressed with poverty and want are now daily increasing in the good things of this life.</p>

<p><a name="xvi.v-p14"></A><b>39.</b> <i>Afterwards they are lessened</i> Ere I enter upon the consideration of the truths contained in this verse, I must make some brief verbal observations. Some make the word <a name="xvi.v-p14.1"></A>&#1506;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512;<i>, otser, 			 </i>to signify <i>tyranny, </i>and certainly <a name="xvi.v-p14.2"></A>&#1506;&#1510;&#1512;<i>, atsar, </i>does signify to <i>bear rule. </i>But since it is used metaphorically for <i>anguish, </i>it appears to me that this is the meaning which is most accordant with 			 the tenor of the passage. The last two words of the verse may be read as in the nominative case, as I have rendered them, or in the genitive, the <i>anguish of misery and sorrow</i> This lection appears to me preferable, <i>through the anguish of misery, </i>  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_288"></A><A HREF="#fn_288"><FONT SIZE="1">289</FONT></A>
 			 <i> and through sorrow.</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.v-p16"></A>We come now to notice shortly the main things in the passage. And as we had formerly a description of the changes which these districts underwent in relation to the nature of the soil, so now we are informed that mankind do not for ever continue in the same condition; because they both decrease in number, and lose their place and property by being reduced by wars or by civil commotions, or by other casualties. Therefore, 			 whether they are wasted by the pestilence, or are defeated in battle, or are cut off by intestine broils, it is manifest that both their rank and condition undergo alteration. And what is the occasion of this change, but that God withdraws his grace, which hitherto formed the hidden spring from which all their prosperity issued? And as there are a thousand casualties by which cities may be ruined, the prophet brings forward one species of change of all others the most palpable and remarkable. 			 And since God&#8217;s hand is not observed in that which relates to persons living in comparative obscurity, he brings into view princes themselves, whose name and fame will not permit any memorable event which befalls them to remain in obscurity. For it seems that the world is made on their account. When God, therefore, hurls them from their lofty estate, then men, aroused as it were from their slumber, are prepared to regard his judgments. Here, too, the mode of address which is employed must be 			 attended to; in saying, that <i>God poured contempt upon princes, </i>it is as if it was his pleasure, so long as they retained their dignity, that honor and respect should be paid to them. The words of Daniel are well known,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvi.v-p17"></A>&#8220;O king, God hath put the fear of thee in the very fowls of the heaven and the beasts of the earth,&#8221; (<a name="xvi.v-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#008">Da 2:8</a><a name="xvi.v-p17.1"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.v-p18"></A>And assuredly, though princes may clothe themselves with power, yet that inward honor and majesty which God has conferred upon them, is a greater safeguard than any human arm. Nor even would a single village hold out for the space of three days, did not God, by his invisible and invincible agency, put a restraint upon the hearts of men. Hence, whenever God renders princes contemptible, their magnificent power must of necessity be subverted. 			 This is a fact corroborated by history, that mighty potentates, who have been the terror and dread of the whole world, when once denuded of their dignity and power, have become the sport even of their own dependants. And inasmuch as such a striking revolution as this should be regarded as a wonderful display of God&#8217;s power, yet such is the obtuseness of our minds, that we will not acknowledge his overruling providence. As a contrast to these reverses, the prophet afterwards shows, that the poor 			 and ignoble are exalted, and their houses increased, and that those who were held in no estimation, suddenly increase in wealth and power. In these things men would assuredly recognize the providence of God, were it not that the perversity of their minds rendered them insensate.</p>  <a name="xvi.vi"></A>

<p><a name="xvi.vi-p7"></A><b>42</b>  <i>The righteous shall see that, and shall rejoice</i> The prophet now draws the conclusion, that so many evident tokens of God&#8217;s superintending and overruling providence could not transpire before the righteous without attracting their notice, and that their vision 			 being illuminated by faith, these scenes are contemplated by them with unfeigned delight; while the wicked remain perplexed and mute. For he very judiciously makes a distinction between these two classes of persons. In whatever manner the wicked may be constrained to recognize God as the supreme ruler of the universe, nevertheless, in seeing they see not, and derive nothing from the sight, except that their conduct is rendered the more inexcusable. But the righteous are not only able to form a 			 good and sound judgment of these events, they also spontaneously open their eyes to contemplate the equity, goodness, and wisdom of God, the sight and knowledge of which are refreshing to them. For the joy which they experience in this exercise is a pledge that their thus observing these things was the spontaneous effusion of their hearts. With regard to the despisers of God, it is not meant that they are so deeply impressed as truly to acknowledge that the world is under his superintending 			 care, but that they are merely so far kept in check as not to presume to deny the existence of that providence as their natural inclination would lead them to do; or, at least, that they meet with a vigorous repulse whenever they attempt to speak in opposition to it. Although the judgments of God are before their eyes, yet is their understanding so darkened, that they cannot perceive the clear light. And this manner of speaking is more energetic than if it had been said, that the wicked 			 themselves are become mute. In fact, they do not cease from murmuring against God&#8217;s dispensations of providence; for we see with what arrogance and contempt they set themselves in opposition to our faith, and have the hardihood to pour forth horrid blasphemies against God. This does not impeach the veracity of the prophet&#8217;s statement, that <i>the mouth of wickedness is stopped, </i>because, in fact, the more proudly and violently they assail God, the more notorious does their impiety appear. Besides, the joy here mentioned arises from this, that there is nothing more calculated to increase our faith, than the knowledge of the providence of God; because, without it, we would be harassed with doubts and fears, being uncertain whether or not the world was governed by chance. For this reason, it follows that those who aim at the subversion of this doctrine, 			 depriving the children of God of true comfort, and vexing their minds by unsettling their faith, forge for themselves a hell upon earth. For what can be more awfully tormenting than to be constantly racked with doubt and anxiety? And we will never be able to arrive at a calm state of mind until we are taught to repose with implicit confidence in the providence of God. Moreover, it is declared in this verse, that God manifests his goodness to all men without exception, and yet there are 			 comparatively few of them who benefit by it. Wherefore, when he formerly called upon all to celebrate the goodness of God, it was in order that the ingratitude of the majority of them might the more plainly appear.</p>

<p><a name="xvi.vi-p9"></A><b>43.</b> <i>Whosoever is wise, so as to observe these things.</i> We are now informed that men begin to be wise when they turn their whole attention to the contemplation of the works of God, and that all others besides are fools. For however much they may pique themselves upon their superior 			 acuteness and subtilty, all this is of no avail so long as they shut their eyes against the light which is presented to them. In employing this interrogatory form of address, he indirectly adverts to that false persuasion which prevails in the world, at the very time when the most daring heaven-despiser esteems himself to be the wisest of men; as if he should say, that all those who do not properly observe the providence of God, will be found to be nothing but fools. This caution is the more 			 necessary, since we find that some of the greatest of philosophers were so mischievous as to devote their talents to obscure and conceal the providence of God, and, entirely overlooking his agency, ascribed all to secondary causes. At the head of these was Aristotle, a man of genius and learning; but being a heathen, whose heart was perverse and depraved, it was his constant aim to entangle and perplex God&#8217;s overruling providence by a variety of wild speculations; so much so, that it may with 			 too much truth be said, that he employed his naturally acute powers of mind to extinguish all light. Besides, the prophet not only condemns the insensate Epicureans, whose insensibility was of the basest character, but he also informs us that a blindness, still greater and more detestable, was to be found among these great philosophers themselves. By the term, <i>observe,</i> he informs 			 us, that the bare apprehension of the works of God is not enough, &#8212; they must be carefully considered in order that the knowledge of them may be deliberately and maturely digested. And, therefore, that it may be engraven upon our hearts, we must make these works the theme of our attentive and constant meditation. When the prophet says, <i>Whosoever is wise, even they shall understand, </i>the change of the singular into the plural number is beautifully appropriate. By the one he tacitly complains of the fewness of those who observe the judgments of God; as if he should say, How seldom do we meet with a person who truly and attentively considers the works of God! Then he adverts to the fact of their being so visibly before all, that it is impossible that men could overlook them, were it not that their minds are perverted by their own wickedness. And if any person be 			 disposed to inquire how it comes to pass that the prophet, after treating of the judgments and severity of God, now makes mention of his loving-kindness, I answer, that his loving-kindness shines most conspicuously, and occupies a very prominent place in all that he does; for he is naturally prone to loving-kindness, by which also he draws us to himself.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvi-p3"></A> &#8220;The author of this psalm is not known; but it was probably David, although some think it better to consider it as having been written after the return from the Babylonish captivity. This psalm is of very singular construction, and was obviously intended to be sung in responses. It has a frequently recurring double burden or intercalary verse. The first burden is found in verses 6, 13, 19, 28; the second 8, 15, 21, 31; that is, after the description of 				a class of calamities comes the first chorus expressing the cry to the Lord for deliverance; then a single verse describes the deliverance as granted, after which follows the chorus of thanksgiving &#8212; and thus on to verse 35, where the system ends. The last two burdens are, however, separate by two verses instead of one, as before. It will also be observed, that the second chorus has sometimes annexed another reflective distich, illustrative of the sentiment, as in verses 9, 16. There are many 				other examples of a similar arrangement to be found in the Psalms; but in Lowth&#8217;s opinion, few of them are equal, and none superior, to this.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible. </i>The beauties of this very interesting and highly instructive composition are many and striking, of which the least intelligent reader who peruses it with any degree of attention must be convinced. In point of poetical beauty, it may, according to the best judges, be classed with the most admired productions 				of Theocritus, Bion, Moschus, or Virgil. &#8220;It may undoubtedly be enumerated,&#8221; remarks Lowth, &#8220;among the most elegant monuments of antiquity; and it is chiefly indebted for its elegance to the general plan and conduct of the poem. It celebrates the goodness and mercy of God towards mankind, as demonstrated in the immediate assistance and comfort which he affords, in the greatest calamities, to those who devoutly implore his aid: in the first place, to those who wander in the desert, and who 				encounter the horrors of famine; next, to those who are in bondage; again, to those who are afflicted with disease; and, finally, to those who are tossed about upon the ocean. The prolixity of the argument is occasionally relieved by narration; and examples are superadded of the divine severity in punishing the wicked, as well as of his benignity to the devout and virtuous.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews, </i>volume 2, page 376. &#8220;Had such an Idyl,&#8221; says Dr Adam Clarke, 				&#8220;appeared in Theocritus or Virgil, or had it been found as a scene in any of the Greek Tragedies, even in &aelig;schylus himself, it would have been praised up to the heavens, and probably been produced as their masterpiece.&#8221;</p> 		  </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvi.ii-p3"></A> To secure the gates of cities, it is customary in the East, at the present day, to cover them with thick plates of brass and iron. Maundrell speaks of the enormous gates of the principal mosque at Damascus, formerly the Church of St John the Baptist, being plated over with brass. Pitts informs us, that Algiers has five gates, and some of these have two, some three, other gates within them; and that some of them are plated all over with thick 						iron, being made strong and convenient for what it is &#8212; a nest of pirates. &#8212; <i>Harmer</i>&#8217;<i>s Observations, </i>volume 1, page 329. To such a practice, which, in all probability, obtained in ancient times, there seems to be here a reference. From this verse some have been inclined to think that the psalm was written after the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity. This deliverance was predicted, in precisely the same terms, in that remarkable passage, where God promises to go 						before Cyrus his anointed, and &#8220;break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron,&#8221; (<a name="xvi.ii-p3.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#002">Isa 45:2</a><a name="xvi.ii-p3.1"></A>) This phraseology appropriately expresses the superior and almost impregnable strength of Babylon. &#8220;Abydenus, quoted by Eusebius in his <a name="xvi.ii-p3.2"></A><i>Praeparatio Evangelica</i><i>, </i>says that the wall of Babylon had brazen gates. And Herodotus more 						particularly, &#8212; &#8216;In the wall all around there are a hundred gates all of brass; and so, in like manner, are the sides and the lintels.&#8217; The gates likewise within the city, opening to the river from the several streets, were of brass: as were those also of the Temple of Belus.&#8221; &#8212; (<i>Lowth</i> on <a name="xvi.ii-p3.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#002">Isa 45:2</a><a name="xvi.ii-p3.3"></A>) But still these brazen gates could not secure the city and the empire from falling into the hands of the 						instrument chosen by God for the deliverance of his people.</p> 				  </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvi.iv-p3"></A> This psalm is distinguished for beautiful and inimitable description. In the preceding part of it, the weary and bewildered traveler, &#8212; the forlorn and wretched captive, shut up in the dungeon and bound in fetters, &#8212; the sick and dying man, &#8212; are painted in the most striking and affecting manner. In this verse there is a transition to ships, and the dangers of mariners foundering in a storm, which is continued to the close of the 30th verse. 						This has often been admired as one of the sublimest descriptions of a sea-storm anywhere to be found, either in the Sacred Writings, or in profane authors.</p> 				  </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvi.iv-p12"></A> The consternation into which those at sea are thrown in a dangerous storm, and their deliverance by God in answer to prayer, is so beautifully described in the well known and admirable hymn of Addison, that we shall take the liberty to quote a part of it:</p>  				
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent01"><a name="xvi.iv-p13"></A>&#8220;Think, O my soul! devoutly think,<br> 				  How with affrighted eyes,<br> 				  Thou saw&#8217;st the wide-extended deep,<br> 				  In all its horrors rise.</p>  				
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent01"><a name="xvi.iv-p14"></A>&#8220;Confusion dwelt on every face,<br> 				  And fear in every heart;<br> 				  When waves on waves, and gulfs on gulfs,<br> 				  O&#8217;ercame the pilot&#8217;s art.</p>  				
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent01"><a name="xvi.iv-p15"></A>&#8220;Yet then, from all my griefs, O Lord,<br> 				  Thy mercy set me free;<br> 				  Whilst in the confidence of prayer,<br> 				  My soul took hold on Thee.</p>  				
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent01"><a name="xvi.iv-p16"></A>&#8220;For though in dreadful whirls we hung<br> 				  High in the broken wave,<br> 				  I knew Thou wert not slow to hear,<br> 				  Nor impotent to save.</p>  				
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent01"><a name="xvi.iv-p17"></A>&#8220;The storm was laid, the winds retir&#8217;d,<br> 				  Obedient to thy will;<br> 				  The sea that roar&#8217;d at thy command,<br> 				  At thy command was still!&#8221;</p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvi.iv-p20"></A> Among the circumstances selected by the prophet in this striking description of a storm at sea, God&#8217;s agency, both in raising and calming it, is not to be overlooked. He is introduced as first causing, by His omnipotent command, the tempest to sweep over the ocean, whose billows are thus made to rise in furious agitation mountains high: and, again, as hushing the winds into a calm, and allaying the agitation of the waves. The description would be 				  utterly mutilated were the special reference to the Divine power in such phenomena omitted. &#8220;How much more comfortable, as well as rational, is the system of the Psalmist, than the Pagan scheme in Virgil, and other poets, where one deity is represented as raising a storm, and another as laying it. Were we only to consider the sublime in this piece of poetry, what can be nobler than the idea it gives us of the Supreme Being, thus raising a tumult among the elements, and recovering them out of 				  their confusion, thus troubling and becalming nature?&#8221; &#8212; <i>Spectator, </i>Number 485.</p> 			 </P>
