<p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN18"><a name="ix-p1"></A>PSALM 100</p>  		
<p><a name="ix-p2"></A>The title of this psalm may serve for a summary of its contents Moreover, its brevity renders a lengthened discourse unnecessary. The Psalmist, in an especial manner, invites believers to praise God, because he has chosen them to be his people, and has taken them under his care.</p>  <a name="ix.i"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption20"><a name="ix.i-p1"></A><a name="ix.i-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#001">Psalm 100:1-3</a><a name="ix.i-p1.1"></A></p>

<p><a name="ix.i-p3"></A><b>1.</b> Let all the earth make a joyful noise to Jehovah. <b>2.</b> Serve Jehovah with gladness: come into his presence with joyfulness. <b>3.</b> Know ye that Jehovah himself is God: he made us, and not we ourselves: we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.</p>

<p><a name="ix.i-p6"></A><b>1</b>  <i>Make a joyful noise</i> The Psalmist refers only to that part of the service of God which consists in recounting his benefits and giving thanks. And since he invites the whole of the inhabitants of the earth indiscriminately to praise Jehovah, he seems, in the spirit 			 of prophecy, to refer to the period when the Church would be gathered out of different nations. Hence he commands (verse 2) that God should <i>be served with gladness, </i>intimating that his kindness towards his own people is so great as to furnish them with abundant ground for rejoicing. This is better expressed in the third verse, in which he first reprehends the presumption of those men 			 who had wickedly revolted from the true God, both in fashioning for themselves gods many, and in devising various forms of worshipping them. And as a multitude of gods destroys and suppresses the true knowledge of one God only, and tarnishes his glory, the prophet, with great propriety, calls upon all men to bethink themselves, and to cease from robbing God of the honor due to his name; and, at the same time, inveighs against their folly in that, not content with the one God, they were become 			 vain in their imaginations. For, however much they are constrained to confess with the mouth that there is a God, the maker of heaven and earth, yet they are ever and anon gradually despoiling him of his glory; and in this manner, the Godhead is, to the utmost extent of their power, reduced to a nonentity. As it is then a most difficult thing to retain men in the practice of the pure worship of God, the prophet, not without reason, recalls the world from its accustomed vanity, and commands them 			 to recognize God as God. For we must attend to this short definition of the knowledge of him, namely, that his glory be preserved unimpaired, and that no deity be opposed to him that might obscure the glory of his name. True, indeed, in the Papacy, God still retains his name, but as his glory is not comprehended in the mere letters of his name, it is certain that there he is not recognized as God. Know, therefore, that the true worship of God cannot be preserved in all its integrity until the 			 base profanation of his glory, which is the inseparable attendant of superstition, be completely reformed.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.i-p7"></A><a name="ix.i-p7.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p8"></A>The prophet next makes mention of the great benefits received from God, and, in an especial manner, desires the faithful to meditate upon them. To say <i>God made us</i> is a very generally acknowledged truth; but not to advert to the ingratitude so usual among men, that scarcely one among a hundred seriously acknowledges 			 that he holds his existence from God, although, when hardly put to it, they do not deny that they were created out of nothing; yet every man makes a god of himself, and virtually worships himself, when he ascribes to his own power what God declares belongs to him alone. Moreover, it must be remembered that the prophet is not here speaking of creation in general, (as I have formerly said,) but of that spiritual regeneration by which he creates anew his image in his elect. Believers are the 			 persons whom the prophet here declares to be God&#8217;s workmanship, not that they were made men in their mother&#8217;s womb, but in that sense in which Paul, in <a name="ix.i-p8.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010">Eph 2:10</a><a name="ix.i-p8.1"></A>, calls them, <a name="ix.i-p8.2"></A>&#932;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#956;&#945;, <i>the workmanship </i>of God, because they are created unto 			 good works which God hath before ordained that they should walk in them; and in reality this agrees best with the subsequent context. For when he says, <i>We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture, </i>he evidently refers to that distinguishing grace which led God to set apart his children for his heritage, in order that he may, as it were, nourish them under his wings, which is a 			 much greater privilege than that of merely being born men. Should any person be disposed to boast that he has of himself become a new man, who is there that would not hold in abhorrence such a base attempt to rob God of that which belongs to him? Nor must we attribute this spiritual birth to our earthly parents, as if by their own power they begat us; for what could a corrupt seed produce? Still the majority of men do not hesitate to claim for themselves all the praise of the spiritual life. 			 Else what mean the preachers of free-will, unless it be to tell us that by our own endeavors we have, from being sons of Adam, become the sons of God? In opposition to this, the prophet in calling us the <i>people of God, </i>informs us that it is of his own good will that we are spiritually regenerated. And by denominating us <i>the sheep of his pasture, </i>he gives us to know that through the same grace which has once been imparted to us, we continue safe and unimpaired until the end. It might be otherwise rendered, <i>he made us his people, </i>etc.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="#fn_123"><FONT SIZE="1">124</FONT></A>
 			  But as the meaning is not altered, I have retained that which was the more generally received reading.</p>  <a name="ix.ii"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption20"><a name="ix.ii-p1"></A><a name="ix.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#004">Psalm 100:4-5</a><a name="ix.ii-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ix.ii-p2"></A><b>4.</b> Enter into his gates with praise, and into his courts with rejoicing: give glory  				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">125</FONT></A>
 				  to him, and bless his name. <b>5.</b> Because Jehovah is good, his mercy endureth for ever, and his truth from generation to generation.</p> 				  			   		    		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ii-p5"></A><a name="ix.ii-p5.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p6"></A><b>4</b>  <i>Enter his gates</i> The conclusion of the psalm is almost the same as the beginning of it, excepting that he adopts a mode of speech which relates to the worship of God which obtained under the law;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">126</FONT></A>
 			  in which, however, he merely reminds us that believers, in rendering thanks to God, do not discharge their duty aright, unless they also continue in the practice of a steady profession of piety. Meanwhile, under the name of the temple, he signifies that God cannot be otherwise worshipped than in strict accordance with the manner prescribed in his law. And, besides, he adds, that <i>God&#8217;s mercy endureth for 			 ever, </i>and that <i>his truth also is everlasting, </i>to point out to us that we can never be at a loss for constant cause of praising him. If, then, God never ceases to deal with us in this manner, it would argue the basest ingratitude on our part, if we wearied in rendering to Him the tribute of praise to which he is entitled. We have elsewhere taken notice of the reason why truth is 			 connected with mercy. For so foolish are we, that we scarcely feel the mercy of God while he openly manifests it, not even in the most palpable displays of it, until he open his holy lips to declare his paternal regard for us.</p>
