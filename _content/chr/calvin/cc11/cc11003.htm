 		  in exhorting the Jews to praise God in solemn assembly, states two grounds why God should be praised; the one, that he sustains by his power the world which he created, the other, that he had of his free grace adopted the Church into a gracious relationship with himself. As many take God&#8217;s praises into their lips in a hypocritical manner, he exhorts the people at the same time to be sincere, serious, and devoted in the service, and to show by the tenor of their life that they had not 		  been chosen in vain. The more effectually to guard them against hypocrisy, he mentions that their fathers from the beginning had been of a stubborn spirit, and chargeable with ingratitude to God; and he takes notice of the dreadful punishment which fell upon them, and which might well deter their children from following in the footsteps of their rebelliousness.</p>  <a name="iv.i"></A>

<p><a name="iv.i-p10"></A><b>1.</b> <i>Come, let us rejoice before Jehovah</i>. This psalm is suited for the Sabbath, when we know that the religious assemblies were more particularly convened for the worship of God. It is not individuals among the godly whom he exhorts to celebrate the divine praises in private; he enjoins these to be offered up in the 			 public meeting. By this he showed that the outward worship of God principally consisted in the sacrifice of praise, and not in dead ceremonies. He enjoins haste upon them; by which they might testify their alacrity in this service. For the Hebrew word <a name="iv.i-p10.1"></A>&#1511;&#1491;&#1501;, <i>kadam</i>, in the second verse, which I have rendered, <i>let us come 			 before</i>, etc., means to <i>make haste</i>. He calls upon them to speed into the presence of God; and such an admonition was needed, considering how naturally backward we are when called by God to the exercise of thanksgiving. This indirect charge of indolence in the exercise, the Psalmist saw it necessary to prefer against God&#8217;s ancient people; and we should be made aware that there is just as much need of a stimulus in our own 			 case, filled as our hearts are with similar ingratitude. In calling them <i>to come before God&#8217;s face</i>, he uses language which was also well fitted to increase the ardor of the worshippers; nothing being more agreeable than to offer in God&#8217;s own presence such a sacrifice as he declares that he will accept. He virtually thus says, in order to prevent their supposing the service vain, that God was present to 			 witness it. I have shown elsewhere in what sense God was present in the sanctuary.</p>

<p><a name="iv.i-p12"></A><b>3.</b> <i>For Jehovah is a great God</i>. By these words the Psalmist reminds us what abundant grounds we have for praising God, and how far we are from needing to employ the lying panegyric with which rhetoricians flatter earthly princes. First, he extols the greatness of God, drawing a tacit contrast between him and such 			 false gods as men have invented for themselves. We know that there has always been a host of gods in the world, as Paul says,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.i-p13"></A>&#8220;There are many on the earth who are called gods,&#8221;<br> 			 (<a name="iv.i-p13.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#005">1Co 8:5</a><a name="iv.i-p13.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="iv.i-p14"></A>We are to notice the opposition stated between the God of Israel and all others which man has formed in the exercise of an unlicensed imagination. Should any object, that &#8220;an idol is nothing in the world,&#8221; (<a name="iv.i-p14.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004">1Co 8:4</a><a name="iv.i-p14.1"></A>,) it is enough to reply, that the Psalmist aims at denouncing the vain delusions of men who 			 have framed gods after their own foolish device. I admit, however, that under this term he may have comprehended the angels, asserting God to be possessed of such excellence as exalted him far above all heavenly glory, and whatever might be considered Divine, as well as above the feigned deities of earth.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A>
 			  Angels are not indeed gods, but the name admits of an improper application to them on account of their being next to God, and still more, on account of their being accounted no less than gods by men who inordinately and superstitiously extol them. If the heavenly angels themselves must yield before the majesty of the one God, it were the height of indignity to compare him with gods who are the mere fictions of the brain. In proof of his greatness, he bids us look to 			 his formation of the world, which he declares to be <i>the work of God&#8217;s hands, </i>and subject to his power. This is one general ground why God is to be praised, that he has clearly shown forth his glory in the creation of the world, and will have us daily recognize him in the government of it. When it is said, that <i>the depths of the 			 earth are in his hand, </i>the meaning is, that it is ruled by his providence, and subject to his power. Some read, <i>the bounds of the earth, </i>but the word means <i>abysses </i>or <i>depths</i>, as opposed to <i>the heights of the mountains. </i>The Hebrew word 			 properly signifies <i>searching.</i></p>  <a name="iv.ii"></A>

<p><a name="iv.ii-p6"></A><b>6.</b> <i>Come ye, let us worship</i> Now that the Psalmist exhorts God&#8217;s chosen people to gratitude, for that pre-eminency among the nations which he had conferred upon them in the exercise of his free favor, his language grows more vehement. God supplies us with ample grounds of praise when he 			 invests us with spiritual distinction, and advances us to a pre-eminency above the rest of mankind which rests upon no merits of our own. In three successive terms he expresses the one duty incumbent upon the children of Abraham, that of an entire devotement of themselves to God. The worship of God, which the Psalmist here speaks of, is assuredly a matter of such importance as to demand our whole strength; but we are to notice, that he particularly condescends upon one point, the paternal favor 			 of God, evidenced in his exclusive adoption of the posterity of Abraham unto the hope of eternal life. We are also to observe, that mention is made not only of inward gratitude, but the necessity of an outward profession of godliness. The three words which are used imply that, to discharge their duty properly, the Lord&#8217;s people must present themselves a sacrifice to him publicly, with kneeling, and other marks of devotion. <i>The face of the Lord </i>is an expression to be understood in the sense I referred to above, &#8212; that the people should prostrate themselves before the Ark of the Covenant, for the reference is to the mode of worship under the Law. This remark, however, must be taken with one reservation, that the worshippers were to lift their eyes to heaven, and serve God in a spiritual manner.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">47</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.ii-p8"></A><a name="iv.ii-p8.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="iv.ii-p9"></A><b>7</b>  <i>Because he is our God</i> While it is true that all men were created to praise God, there are reasons why the Church is specially said to have been formed for that end, (<a name="iv.ii-p9.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003">Isa 61:3</a><a name="iv.ii-p9.1"></A>.) The Psalmist was entitled to require this service more particularly from the hands of his chosen people. This is the reason why he impresses upon the children of Abraham the invaluable privilege which God had conferred upon them in taking them under his protection. God may indeed be said in a sense to have done so much for all mankind. But when asserted to be the Shepherd of the Church, more is meant than that he favors her with the common nourishment, 			 support, and government which he extends promiscuously to the whole human family; he is so called because he separates her from the rest of the world, and cherishes her with a peculiar and fatherly regard. His people are here spoken of accordingly as the <i>people of his pastures, </i>whom he watches over with peculiar care, and loads with blessings of every kind. The passage might have 			 run more clearly had the Psalmist called them <i>the flock of his pastures, </i>and <i>the people of his hand;</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">48</FONT></A>
 			  or, had he added merely &#8212; <i>and his flock</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">49</FONT></A>
 			  &#8212; the figure might have been brought out more consistently and plainly. But his object was less elegancy of expression than pressing upon the people a sense of the inestimable favor conferred upon them in their adoption, by virtue of which they were called to live under the faithful guardianship of God, and to the enjoyment of every species of blessings. They are called <i>the flock of his 			 hand, </i>not so much because formed by his hand as because governed by it, or, to use a French expression, <i>le Troupeau de sa conduite.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">50</FONT></A>
 			  The point which some have given to the expression, as if it intimated how intent God was upon feeding his people, doing it himself, and not employing hired shepherds, may scarcely perhaps be borne out by the words in their genuine meaning; but it cannot be doubted that the Psalmist would express the very gracious and familiar kind of guidance which was enjoyed by this one nation at that time. Not that God dispensed with human agency, 			 intrusting the care of the people as he did to priests, prophets, and judges, and latterly to kings. No more is meant than that in discharging the office of shepherd to this people, he exercised a superintendence over them different from that common providence which extends to the rest of the world.</p>  		  
<p><a name="iv.ii-p13"></A><i>To-day, if you will hear his voice</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">51</FONT></A>
 			  According to the Hebrew expositors, this is a conditional clause standing connected with the preceding sentence; by which interpretation the Psalmist must be considered as warning the people that they would only retain possession of their privilege and distinction so long as they continued to obey God.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">52</FONT></A>
 			  The Greek version joins it with the verse that follows &#8212; <i>to-day, </i>if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts<i>, </i>and it reads well in this connection. Should we adopt the distribution of the Hebrew expositors, the Psalmist seems to say that the posterity of Abraham were the flock of God&#8217;s hand, 			 inasmuch as he had placed his Law in the midst of them, which was, as it were, his crook, and had thus showed himself to be their shepherd. The Hebrew particle <a name="iv.ii-p15.4"></A>&#1488;&#1501;, <i>im, </i>which has been rendered <i>if</i>, would in that case be rather expositive than conditional, 			 and might be rendered <i>when,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">53</FONT></A>
 			  the words denoting it to be the great distinction between the Jews and the surrounding nations, that God had directed his voice to the former, as it is frequently noticed he had not done to the latter, (<a name="iv.ii-p16.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#020">Ps 147:20</a><a name="iv.ii-p16.3"></A>; <a name="iv.ii-p16.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006">Deut. 4:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#007">7</a><a name="iv.ii-p16.4"></A>.) Moses had declared this to constitute the ground of their superiority to other people, saying, &#8220;What nation is there under heaven which hath its gods so nigh unto it?&#8221; The inspired writers borrow frequently from Moses, as is well known, and the Psalmist, by the expression <i>to-day, </i>intimates how emphatically the Jews, in hearing God&#8217;s voice, were 			 his people, for the proof was not far off, it consisted in something which was present and before their eyes. He bids them recognize God as their shepherd, inasmuch as they heard his voice; and it was an instance of his singular grace that he had addressed them in such a condescending and familiar manner. Some take the adverb to be one of exhortation, and read, <i>I</i> <i>would that they would hear my voice, </i>but this does violence to the words. The passage runs well taken in the other meaning we have assigned to it. Since they had a constant opportunity of hearing the voice of God &#8212; since he gave them not only one proof of the care he had over them as shepherd, or yearly proof of it, but a continual exemplification of it, there could be no doubt that the Jews were chosen to be his flock.</p>  <a name="iv.iii"></A>

<p><a name="iv.iii-p11"></A><b>8.</b> <i>Harden not your heart, as in Meribah</i> The Psalmist, having extolled and commended the kindness of God their Shepherd, takes occasion, as they were stiffnecked and disobedient, to remind them of their duty, as his flock, which was to yield a pliable and meek submission; and the more 			 to impress their minds, he upbraids them with the obstinacy of their fathers. The term <a name="iv.iii-p11.2"></A>&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;<i>, Meribah, </i>may be used appellatively to mean <i>strife </i>or <i>contention; </i>but as the Psalmist evidently refers to the history contained in <a name="iv.iii-p11.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#002">Ex 17:2-7</a><a name="iv.iii-p11.3"></A>,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">58</FONT></A>

 			  In the second clause, however, the place where the temptation happened may be thought sufficiently described under the term <i>wilderness, </i>and should any read, <i>according to the day of temptation </i>(instead of <i>Massah</i>)<i> in the wilderness, </i>there can be no objection. Some would have it, that Massah and Meribah were two distinct places, but I see no ground to think so; and, in a matter of so little importance, we should not be too nice or curious. He enlarges in several expressions upon the hardness of heart evinced by the people, and, to produce the greater effect, introduces God himself as speaking.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_59"><FONT SIZE="1">60</FONT></A>
 			  By hardness of heart, he no doubt means, any kind of contempt shown to the word of God, though there are many different kinds of it. We find that when proclaimed, it is heard by some in a cold and slighting manner; that some fastidiously put it away from them after they had received it; that others proudly reject it; while again there are men who openly vent their rage against it with despite and blasphemy.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A>
 			  The Psalmist, in the one term which he has employed, comprehends all these defaulters, the careless &#8212; the fastidious &#8212; such as deride the word, and such as are actuated in their opposition to it by frenzy and passion. Before the heart can be judged soft and pliable to the hearing of God&#8217;s word, it is necessary that we receive it with reverence, and with a disposition to obey it. If it carry no authority and weight with it, we show that we regard him as no more than 			 a mere man like ourselves; and here lies the hardness of our hearts, whatever may be the cause of it, whether simply carelessness, or pride, or rebellion. He has intentionally singled out the odious term here employed, to let us know what an execrable thing contempt of God&#8217;s word is; as, in the Law, <i>adultery </i>is used to denote all kinds of fornication and uncleanness, and <i>murder </i>all kinds of 			 violence, and injury, hatreds, and enmities. Accordingly, the man who simply treats the word of God with neglect, and fails to obey it, is said here to have a hard and stony heart, although he may not be an open despiser. The attempt is ridiculous which the Papists have made to found upon this passage their favorite doctrine of the liberty of the will. We are to notice, in the first place, that all men&#8217;s hearts are naturally hard and stony; for Scripture does not speak of this as a disease 			 peculiar to a few, but characteristic in general of all mankind, (<a name="iv.iii-p15.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026">Eze 36:26</a><a name="iv.iii-p15.2"></A>.) It is an inbred pravity; still it is voluntary; we are not insensible in the same manner that stones are,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_61"></A><A HREF="#fn_61"><FONT SIZE="1">62</FONT></A>
 			  and the man who will not suffer himself to be ruled by God&#8217;s word, makes that heart, which was hard before, harder still, and is convinced as to his own sense and feeling of obstinacy. The consequence by no means follows from this, that softness of heart &#8212; a heart flexible indifferently in either direction, is at our command.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">63</FONT></A>
 			  The will of man, through natural corruption, is wholly bent to evil; or, to speak more properly, is carried headlong into the commission of it. And yet every man, who disobeys God therein, hardens himself; for the blame of his wrong doing rests with none but himself.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.iii-p18"></A><a name="iv.iii-p18.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="iv.iii-p19"></A><b>9</b>  <i>When your fathers tempted me, they proved me</i> The Psalmist insinuates, as I have already remarked, that the Jews had been from the first of a perverse and almost intractable spirit. And there were two reasons which made it highly useful to remind the children 			 of the guilt chargeable upon their fathers. We know how apt men are to follow the example of their predecessors; custom begets a sanction; what is ancient becomes venerable, and such is the blinding influence of home example, that whatever may have been done by our forefathers passes for a virtue without examination. We have an instance in Popedom, of the audacity with which the authority of the fathers is opposed to God&#8217;s word. The Jews were of all others most liable to be deceived upon this 			 side, ever accustomed as they were to boast of their fathers. The Psalmist accordingly would detach them from the fathers, by taking notice of the monstrous ingratitude with which they had been chargeable. A second reason, and one to which I have already adverted, is, that he would show them the necessity in which they stood of being warned upon the present subject. Had their fathers not manifested a rebellions spirit, they might have retorted by asking the question, Upon what ground he warned 			 them against hardness of heart, their nation having hitherto maintained a character for docility and tractableness? The fact being otherwise &#8212; their fathers having from the first been perverse and stubborn, the Psalmist had a plain reason for insisting upon the correction of this particular vice.</p>  		  
<p class="Super"><a name="iv.iii-p20"></A>There are two ways of interpreting the words which follow. As <i>tempting God </i>is nothing else than yielding to a diseased and unwarrantable craving after proof of his power,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A>
 			  we may consider the verse as connected throughout, and read, <i>They tempted me and proved me, although they had already seen my work</i> God very justly complains, that they should insist upon new proof, after his power had been already amply testified by undeniable evidences. There is another meaning, however, that may be given to the term 			 <i>proved,</i> &#8212; according to which, the meaning of the passage would run as follows: &#8212; Your fathers tempted me in asking where God was, notwithstanding all the benefits I had done them; and they proved me, that is, they had actual experience of what I am, inasmuch as I did not cease to give them open proofs of my presence, and consequently they saw my work. Whatever sense we adopt, the 			 Psalmist&#8217;s design is plainly to show how inexcusable the Jews were in desiring a discovery of God&#8217;s power, just as if it had been hidden, and had not been taught them by the most incontestable proofs.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_64"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A>
 			  Granting that they had received no foregoing demonstration of it, they would have evinced an unbecoming spirit in demanding of God why he had failed to provide them with meat and drink; but to doubt his presence after he had brought them from Egypt with an outstretched hand, and evidenced his nearness to them by most convincing testimonies, &#8212; to doubt his presence in the same manner as if it had never been revealed, was a degree of perverse forgetfulness which 			 aggravated their guilt. Upon the whole, I consider the following to be the sense of the passage &#8212; Your fathers tempted me, although they had abundantly proved &#8212; perceived by clear and undeniable evidences, that I was their God &#8212; nay, although my works had been clearly set before them. The lesson is one which is equally applicable to ourselves; for the more abundant testimonies we may have had of the power and loving-kindness of the Lord, the greater will our sin be, if we insist upon receiving 			 additional proofs of them. How many do we find in our own day demanding miracles, while others murmur against God because he does not indulge their wishes? Some may ask why the Psalmist singles out the particular case of Meribah, when there were many other instances which he might have adduced. They never ceased to provoke God from the moment of their passing the Red Sea; and in bringing this one charge only against them, he might seem by his silence on other points to justify their conduct. 			 But the figure synecdoche is common in Scripture, and it would be natural enough to suppose that one case is selected for many. At the same time, another reason for the specification may have been, that, as plainly appears from Moses, the ingratitude and rebellion of the people reached its greatest height on this occasion, when they murmured for water. I am aware that interpreters differ upon this. Such, however, was the fact. They then crowned their former impiety; nor was it until this outcry 			 was made, as the consummating act of all their preceding wickedness, that they gave open proof of their obstinacy being incurable.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_65"></A><A HREF="#fn_65"><FONT SIZE="1">66</FONT></A>

 			  The Psalmist brings it forward as an aggravation of their perverse obstinacy, that God strove with them for so long a time without effect. Occasionally it will happen that there is a violent manifestation of perversity which soon subsides; but God complains that he had constant grounds of contention with his people, throughout the whole forty years. And this proves to us the incurable waywardness of that people. The word <i>generation</i> is used with the same view. The word <a name="iv.iii-p26.2"></A>&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, <i>dor, </i>signifies an age, or the allotted term of human life; and it is here applied to the men of an age, as if the Psalmist had said, that the Israelites whom God had delivered were incorrigible, during the whole 			 period of their lives. The verb <a name="iv.iii-p26.3"></A>&#1488;&#1511;&#1493;&#1496;, <i>akut, </i>which I have rendered <i>I strove, </i>is, by some, translated <i>contemned, </i>and in the Septuagint it reads, <a name="iv.iii-p26.4"></A>&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#969;&#967;&#952;&#953;&#963;&#945;,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">68</FONT></A>
 			  <i>I was incensed, </i>or <i>enraged; </i>but Hebrew interpreters retain the genuine meaning, That God strove with them in a continual course of contention. This was a remarkable proof of their extreme obstinacy; and God is introduced in the verse as formally pronouncing judgment upon them, to intimate, that after having shown their ungodliness in so many different ways, there 			 could be no doubt regarding their infatuation. <i>Erring in heart, </i>is an expression intended not to extenuate their conduct, but to stamp it with folly and madness, as if he had said, that he had to do with beasts, rather than men endued with sense and intelligence. The reason is subjoined, that they would not attend to the many works of God brought under their eyes, and more than 			 all, to his word; for the Hebrew term <a name="iv.iii-p27.8"></A>&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;, <i>derech, </i>which I have rendered <i>ways, </i>comprehends his law and repeated admonitions, as well as his miracles done before them. It argued amazing infatuation that when God had 			 condescended to dwell in such a familiar manner amongst them, and had made such illustrious displays of himself, both in word and works, they should have shut their eyes and overlooked all that had been done. This is the reason why the Psalmist, considering that they wandered in error under so much light as they enjoyed, speaks of their stupidity as amounting to madness.</p>

<p><a name="iv.iii-p29"></A><b>11.</b> <i>Wherefore I have sworn in my wrath</i> I see no objection to the relative <a name="iv.iii-p29.1"></A>&#1488;&#1513;&#1512;, <i>asher, </i>being understood in its proper sense and 			 reading &#8212; <i>To</i> <i>whom I have sworn. </i>The Greek version, taking it for a mark of similitude, reads, As <i>I have sworn</i> But I think that it may be properly considered as expressing an inference or conclusion; not as if they were then at last deprived of the promised inheritance when they 			 tempted God, but the Psalmist, having spoken, in the name of God, of that obstinacy which they displayed, takes occasion to draw the inference that there was good reason for their being prohibited, with an oath, from entering the land. Proportionally as they multiplied their provocations, it became the more evident that, being incorrigible, they had been justly cut off from God&#8217;s rest.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">69</FONT></A>
 			  The meaning would be more clear by reading in the pluperfect tense &#8212; <i>I</i> <i>had sworn; </i>for God had already shut them out from the promised inheritance, having foreseen their misconduct; before he thus strove with them. I have elsewhere adverted to the explanation which is to be given of the elliptical form in which the oath runs.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">70</FONT></A>
 			  The land of Canaan is called God&#8217;s <i>rest</i> in reference to the promise. Abraham and his posterity had been wanderers in it until the full time came for entering upon the possession of it. Egypt had been a temporary asylum, and, as it were, a place of exile. In preparing to plant the Jews, agreeably to his promise, in their rightful patrimony of Canaan, 			 God might very properly call it his rest. The word must be taken, however, in the active sense; this being the great benefit which God bestowed, that the Jews were to dwell there, as in their native soil, and in a quiet habitation. We might stop a moment here to compare what the Apostle states in the third and fourth chapters of his Epistle to the Hebrews, with the passage now before us. That the Apostle follows the Greek version, need occasion no surprise.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">71</FONT></A>
 			  Neither is he to be considered as undertaking professedly to treat this passage. He only insists upon the adverb <i>To-day, </i>and upon the word <i>Rest</i> And first, he states that the expression <i>to-day, </i>is not to be confined to the time when the Law was given, 			 but properly applies to the Gospel, when God began to speak more openly. The fuller and more perfect declaration of doctrine demanded the greater share of attention. God has not ceased to speak: he has revealed his Son, and is daily inviting us to come unto him; and, undoubtedly, it is our incumbent duty, under such an opportunity, to obey his voice. The Apostle next reasons from the <i>rest, </i>to an extent which we are not to suppose that the words of the Psalmist themselves warrant.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">72</FONT></A>
 			  He takes it up as a first position, that since there was an implied promise in the punishment here denounced, there must have been some better rest promised to the people of God than the land of Canaan. For, when the Jews had entered the land, God held out to his people the prospect of another rest, which is defined by the Apostle to consist in that renouncing of ourselves, whereby we rest from our own works while God worketh in us. From this, he takes occasion to 			 compare the old Sabbath, or rest, under the Law, which was figurative, with the newness of spiritual life.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A>
 			  When his said that he <i>swore in his wrath, </i>this intimates that he was in a manner freed to inflict this punishment, that the provocation was of no common or slight kind, but that their awful obstinacy inflamed his anger, and drew from him this oath.</p>

But this depends on the punctuation system of the Masorites, 						which the Apostle has not followed. It is of little consequence whether the words <i>forty years </i>are connected with the close of the 9th verse or the beginning of the 10th; the sense in either case being substantially the same. If the Israelites tempted God forty years, he strove with them during that period; and if he strove with them for so long a time, it was because they tempted him. The Apostle shows that either of these readings may be indifferently adopted, when, in the 17th verse of 						that chapter, instead of speaking of the forty years as the space of time during which the Israelites tempted God, he speaks of them as the period during which God was grieved by that rebellious people. &#8220;But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?&#8221;</p> 				  </P>

Moses Stuart, in his commentary on this passage, as quoted in 						<a name="iv.iii-p5.9"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#010">Heb 3:10</a><a name="iv.iii-p5.9"></A>, understands <i>the heart </i>as pleonastic; so that the phrase imports simply, <i>They always err</i>,<i> i</i> <i>e</i>., they are continually departing 						from the right way. But the phrase, we think, is intended to convey another idea, &#8212; that God, in judging of the character and conduct of men, has a special regard to the state of the heart. It is the heart which he principally requires in our obedience; and this he chiefly looks to in men&#8217;s disobedience. When it is upright as to its general frame, design, and principle, he will bear with many failings and shortcomings. When it is insincere, he will set no value whatever on any outward 						professions or actions, however good in themselves. We ourselves act upon the same principle, and are justified in doing so. If a man discovers that he has just ground to suspect that the hearts of those with whom he has intimate intercourse, are false and deceitful towards him, he ceases to respect and love them, whatever may be their professions of friendship. The lines of the Greek poet, though inconsistent with the subdued feeling and tone of Christian benevolence, which, in this case, 						instead of hatred to the person, produces regret and grief; yet show that men universally, from their very nature, take into account the state of the heart in estimating the professions and conduct of others towards them: &#8212;</p>
