<p><a name="xi.i-p15"></A><b>1.</b><i> Let a man so account of us</i>  As it was a matter of no little importance to see the Church in this manner torn by corrupt factions, from the likings or dislikings that were entertained towards individuals, he enters into a still more lengthened discussion as to the ministry of the word. 			 Here there are <i>three </i>things to be considered in their order. In the <i>first </i>place, Paul describes the office of a pastor of the Church. <i>Secondly</i>, he shows, that it is not enough for any one to produce a title, or even to undertake the duty &#8212; a faithful administration of the office being requisite. 			 <i>Thirdly</i>, as the judgment formed of him by the Corinthians was preposterous,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_206"></A><A HREF="#fn_206"><FONT SIZE="1">207</FONT></A>
 			  he calls both himself and them to the judgment-seat of Christ. In the first place, then, he teaches in what estimation every teacher in the Church ought to be held. In this department he modifies his discourse in such a manner as neither, on the one hand, to lower the credit of the ministry, nor, on the other, to assign to man more than is expedient. For both of these things are exceedingly dangerous, because, when ministers are lowered, contempt of the word 			 arises,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_207"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">208</FONT></A>
 			  while, on the other hand, if they are extolled beyond measure, they abuse liberty, and become &#8220;wanton against the Lord.&#8221; (<a name="xi.i-p17.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#011">1Ti 5:11</a><a name="xi.i-p17.2"></A>.) Now the medium observed by Paul consists in this, that he calls them <i>ministers of Christ</i>; by which he intimates, that they ought to apply themselves not to their own work but to that of the Lord, who has hired them as his servants, and that they are not appointed to bear rule in an authoritative manner in the Church, but are subject to Christ&#8217;s authority   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_208"></A><A HREF="#fn_208"><FONT SIZE="1">209</FONT></A>
 			  &#8212; in short, that they are servants, not masters.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p19"></A>As to what he adds &#8212; <i>stewards of the mysteries of God</i>, he expresses hereby the kind of service. By this he intimates, that their office extends no farther than this, that they are <i>stewards 			 of the mysteries of God</i>  In other words, what the Lord has committed to their charge they deliver over to men from hand to hand &#8212; as the expression is   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">210</FONT></A>
 			  &#8212; not what they themselves might choose. &#8220;For this purpose has God chosen them as ministers of his Son, that he might through them communicate to men his heavenly wisdom, and hence they ought not to move a step beyond this.&#8221; He appears, at the same time, to give a stroke indirectly to the Corinthians, who, leaving in the background the heavenly mysteries, had begun to hunt with excessive eagerness after strange 			 inventions, and hence they valued their teachers for nothing but profane learning. It is an honorable distinction that he confers upon the gospel when he terms its contents <i>the mysteries of God. </i>But as the sacraments are connected with these mysteries as appendages, it follows, that those who have the charge of administering the word are the authorized <i>stewards</i> of them also.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xi.i-p21"></A><a name="xi.i-p21.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p22"></A><b>2.</b> <i>But it is required in ministers</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">211</FONT></A>
 			  It is as though he had said, it is not enough to be a <i>steward</i> if there be not an upright stewardship. Now the rule of an upright stewardship, is to conduct one&#8217;s self in it with fidelity. It is a passage that ought to be carefully observed, for we see how haughtily   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">212</FONT></A>
 			  Papists require that everything that they do and teach should have the authority of law, simply on the ground of their being called pastors. On the other hand, Paul is so far from being satisfied with the mere title, that, in his view, it is not even enough that there is a legitimate call, unless the person who is called conducts himself in the office with fidelity. On every occasion, therefore, on which Papists hold up before us the mask of a name, for the purpose 			 of maintaining the tyranny of their idol, let our answer be, that Paul requires more than this from the <i>ministers of Christ</i>, though, at the same time, the Pope and his attendant train are wanting not merely in fidelity in the discharge of the office, but also in the ministry itself, if everything is duly considered.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p25"></A>This passage, however, militates, not merely against wicked teachers, but also against all that have any other object in view than the glory of Christ and the edification of the Church. For every one that teaches the truth is not necessarily faithful, but, only he who desires from the heart to serve the Lord and advance Christ&#8217;s kingdom. Nor is it without good reason that Augustine assigns to <i>hirelings</i>, (<a name="xi.i-p25.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#012">Joh 10:12</a><a name="xi.i-p25.1"></A>,) a middle place between the <i>wolves </i>and the good teachers. As to Christ&#8217;s requiring <i>wisdom </i>also on the part of the good <i>steward</i>, (<a name="xi.i-p25.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042">Lu 12:42</a><a name="xi.i-p25.2"></A>,) he speaks, it is true, in that passage with greater clearness than Paul, but the meaning is the same. For the <i>faithfulness </i>of which Christ speaks is 			 uprightness of conscience, which must be accompanied with sound and prudent counsel. By a faithful minister Paul means one who, with knowledge as well as uprightness,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">213</FONT></A>
 			 discharges the office of a good and faithful minister.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xi.i-p27"></A><a name="xi.i-p27.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p28"></A><b>3.</b><i> But with me it is a very small thing</i>  It remained that he should bring before their view his <i>faithfulness</i>, that the Corinthians might judge of him 			 from this, but, as their judgment was corrupted, he throws it aside and appeals to the judgment-seat of Christ. The Corinthians erred in this, that they looked with amazement at foreign masks, and gave no heed to the true and proper marks of distinction.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">214</FONT></A>
 			  He, accordingly, declares with great confidence, that he despises a perverted and blind judgment of this sort. In this way, too, he, on the one hand, admirably exposes the vanity of the false Apostles who made the mere applause of men their aim, and reckoned themselves happy if they were held in admiration; and, on the other hand, he severely chastises the arrogance   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">215</FONT></A>
 			  of the Corinthians, which was the reason why they were so much blinded in their judgment.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p31"></A>But, it is asked, on what ground it was allowable for Paul, not merely to set aside the censure of one Church, but to set himself above the judgment of men? for this is a condition common to all pastors &#8212; to be judged of by the Church. I answer, that it is the part of a good pastor to submit both his doctrine and his life for examination to the judgment of the Church, and that it is the sign of a good conscience not to shun the light of 			 careful inspection. In this respect Paul, without doubt, was prepared for submitting himself to the judgment of the Corinthian Church, and for being called to render an account both of his life and of his doctrine, had there been among them a proper scrutiny,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_215"></A><A HREF="#fn_215"><FONT SIZE="1">216</FONT></A>
 			 as he often assigns them this power, and of his own accord entreats them to be prepared to judge aright. But when a faithful pastor sees that he is borne down by unreasonable and perverse affections, and that justice and truth have no place, he ought to appeal to God, and betake himself to his judgment-seat, regardless of human opinion, especially when he cannot secure that a true and proper knowledge of matters shall be arrived at.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p33"></A>If, then, the Lord&#8217;s servants would bear in mind that they must act in this manner, let them allow their doctrine and life to be brought to the test, nay more, let them voluntarily present themselves for this purpose; and if anything is objected against them, let them not decline to answer. But if they see that they are condemned without being heard in their own defense, and that judgment is passed upon them without their being 			 allowed a hearing, let them raise up their minds to such a pitch of magnanimity, as that, despising the opinions of men, they will fearlessly wait for God as their judge. In this manner the Prophets of old, having to do with refractory persons,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">217</FONT></A>
 			 and such as had the audacity to despise the word of God in their administration of it, required to raise themselves aloft, in order to tread under foot that diabolical obstinacy, which manifestly tended to overthrow at once the authority of God and the light of truth. Should any one, however, when opportunity is given for defending himself, or at least when he has need to clear himself, appeal to God by way of subterfuge, he will not thereby make good his innocence, but will rather 			 discover his consummate impudence.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">218</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p36"></A><i>Or of man&#8217;s day.</i> While others explain it in another manner, the simpler way, in my opinion, is to understand the word <i>day </i>as used metaphorically to mean <i>judgment</i>, because there are stated <i>days </i>for administering justice, and the accused are summoned to appear on a certain <i>day</i>  He calls it <i>man&#8217;s day</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_218"></A><A HREF="#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">219</FONT></A>
 			  when judgment is pronounced, not according to truth, or in accordance with the word of the Lord, but according to the humor or rashness of men,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_219"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">220</FONT></A>
 			  and in short, when God does not preside. &#8220;Let men,&#8221; says he, &#8220;<i>sit </i>for judgment as they please: it is enough for me that God will annul whatever they have pronounced.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p39"></A><i>Nay, I judge not mine own self.</i> The meaning is: &#8220;I do not venture to judge myself, though I know myself best; how then will you judge me, to whom I am less intimately known?&#8221; Now he proves that he does not venture to judge himself by this, that though he is not conscious to himself of 			 anything wrong, he is not thereby acquitted in the sight of God. Hence he concludes, that what the Corinthians assume to themselves, belongs exclusively to God. &#8220;As for me,&#8221; says he, &#8220;when I have carefully examined myself, I perceive that I am not so clear-sighted as to discern thoroughly my true character; and hence I leave this to the judgment of God, who alone can judge, and to whom this 			 authority exclusively belongs. As for you, then, on what ground will you make pretensions to something more?&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p40"></A>As, however, it were very absurd to reject all kinds of judgment, whether of individuals respecting themselves, or of one individual respecting his brother, or of all together respecting their pastor, let it be understood that Paul speaks here not of the actions of men, which may be reckoned good or bad according to the word of the Lord, but of the eminence of each individual, which ought not to be estimated according to men&#8217;s humors. It 			 belongs to God alone to determine what distinction every one holds, and what honor he deserves. The Corinthians, however, despising Paul, groundlessly extolled others to the skies, as though they had at their command that knowledge which belonged exclusively to God. This is what he previously made mention of as <i>man</i>&#8217;<i>s day</i> &#8212; when men mount the throne of judgment, and, as if they were gods, anticipate the day of Christ, who alone is appointed by the Father as judge, allot to every 			 one his station of honor, assign to some a high place, and degrade others to the lowest seats. But what rule of distinction do they observe? They look merely to what appears openly; and thus what in their view is high and honorable, is in many instances <i>an abomination in the sight of God</i>. (<a name="xi.i-p40.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#015">Lu 16:15</a><a name="xi.i-p40.1"></A>.) If any one farther objects, that the ministers of the word may in this world be distinguished by 			 their works, as trees <i>by their fruits</i>, (<a name="xi.i-p40.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#016">Mt 7:16</a><a name="xi.i-p40.2"></A>,) I admit that this is true, but we must consider with whom Paul had to deal. It was with persons who, in judging, looked to nothing but show and pomp, and arrogated to themselves a power which Christ., while in this world, refrained from using &#8212; that of assigning to every one his <i>seat in the kingdom of God</i>. (<a name="xi.i-p40.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#023">Mt 20:23</a><a name="xi.i-p40.3"></A>.) He does not, therefore, prohibit us from esteeming those whom we have found to be faithful workmen, and pronouncing them to be such; nor, on the other hand, from judging persons to be bad workmen according to the word of God, but he condemns that rashness which is practiced, when some are preferred above others in a spirit of ambition &#8212; not according to their merits, but without examination of the case.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">221</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xi.i-p42"></A><a name="xi.i-p42.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p43"></A><b>4.</b> <i>I am not conscious to myself of anything faulty.</i> Let us observe that Paul speaks here not of his whole life, but simply of the office of apostleship. For if he had been altogether unconscious to himself of anything wrong,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">222</FONT></A>
 			  that would have been a groundless complaint which he makes in <a name="xi.i-p44.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015">Ro 7:15</a><a name="xi.i-p44.3"></A>, where he laments that <i>the evil which he would not</i>,<i> that he does</i>, and that he is by sin kept back from giving himself up entirely to God. 			 Paul, therefore, felt <i>sin dwelling in him</i>, and confessed it; but as to his apostleship, (which is the subject that is here treated of,) he had conducted himself with so much integrity and fidelity, that his conscience did not accuse him as to anything. This is a protestation of no common character, and of such a nature as clearly shows the piety and sanctity of his breast;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">223</FONT></A>
 			  and yet he says that <i>he is not thereby justified, </i>that is, pure, and altogether free from guilt in the sight of God. Why? Assuredly, because God sees much more distinctly than we; and hence, what appears to us cleanest, is filthy in his eyes. Here we have a beautiful and singularly profitable admonition, not to measure the strictness of God&#8217;s judgment by our own opinion; for we are dim-sighted, but God is 			 preeminently discerning. We think of ourselves too indulgently, but God is a judge of the utmost strictness. Hence the truth of what Solomon says &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="xi.i-p46"></A>&#8220;Every man&#8217;s ways appear right his own eyes, but the Lord pondereth the hearts.&#8221; (<a name="xi.i-p46.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#002">Pr 21:2</a><a name="xi.i-p46.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p47"></A>Papists abuse this passage for the purpose of shaking the assurance of faith, and truly, I confess, that if their doctrine were admitted, we could do nothing but tremble in wretchedness during our whole life. For what tranquillity could our minds enjoy if it were to be determined from our works whether we are well-pleasing to God? I confess, therefore, that from the main foundation of Papists there follows nothing but continual disquietude for 			 consciences; and, accordingly, we teach that we must have recourse to the free promise of mercy, which is offered to us in Christ, that we may be fully assured that we are accounted righteous by God.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xi.i-p48"></A><a name="xi.i-p48.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p49"></A><b>5.</b> <i>Therefore judge nothing before the time</i>  From this conclusion it is manifest, that Paul did not mean to reprove every kind of judgment without exception, but only what is hasty and rash, without examination of the case. For the Corinthians did not mark with 			 unjaundiced eye the character of each individual, but, blinded by ambition, groundlessly extolled one and depreciated another, and took upon themselves to mark out the dignity of each individual beyond what is lawful for men. Let us know, then, how much is allowed us, what is now within the sphere of our knowledge, and what is deferred until the day of Christ, and let us not attempt to go beyond these limits. For there are some things that are now seen openly, while there are others that lie 			 buried in obscurity until the day of Christ.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p50"></A><i>Who will bring to light.</i> If this is affirmed truly and properly respecting the day of Christ, it follows that matters are never so well regulated in this world but that many things are involved in darkness, and that there is never so much light, but that many things remain in obscurity. I speak of the life of men, and their actions. He 			 explains in the second clause, what is the cause of the obscurity and confusion, so that all things are not now manifest. It is because there are wonderful recesses and deepest lurking-places in the hearts of men. Hence, until the thoughts of the hearts are brought to light, there will always be darkness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p51"></A><i>And then shall every one have praise</i>  It is as though he had said, &#8220;You now, O Corinthians, as if you had the adjudging of the prizes,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">224</FONT></A>
 			  crown some, and send away others with disgrace, but this right and office belong exclusively to Christ. You do that <i>before the time</i> &#8212; before it has become manifest who is worthy to be crowned, but the Lord has appointed a day on which he will make it manifest.&#8221; This statement takes its rise from the assurance of a good conscience, which brings us also this advantage, that 			 committing our <i>praises </i>into the hands of God, we disregard the empty breath of human applause.</p>  <a name="xi.ii"></A>

 			  But as he could more freely and less invidiously bring forward his own name, and that of his brethren, he preferred to point out in his own person the fault that existed in others.

<p><a name="xi.ii-p16"></A><b>7.</b> <i>For who distinguisheth thee?</i> The meaning is &#8212; &#8220;Let that man come forward, whosoever he be, that is desirous of distinction, and troubles the Church by his ambition. I will demand of him who it is that makes him superior to others? That is, who it is that has conferred upon him the 			 privilege of being taken out of the rank of the others, and made superior to others?&#8221; Now this whole reasoning depends on the order which the Lord has appointed in his Church &#8212; that the members of Christ&#8217;s body may be united together, and that every one of them may rest satisfied with his own place, his own rank, his own office, and his own honor. If one member is desirous to quit his place, that he may leap over into the place of another, and invade his office, what will become of the entire 			 body? Let us know, then, that the Lord has so placed us in the Church, and has in such a manner assigned to every one his own station, that, being under one head, we may be mutually helpful to each other. Let us know, besides, that we have been endowed with a diversity of gifts, in order that we may serve the Lord with modesty and humility, and may endeavor to promote the glory of him who has conferred upon us everything that we have. This, then, was the best remedy for correcting the ambition 			 of those who were desirous of distinction &#8212; to call them back to God, in order that they might acknowledge that it was not according to any one&#8217;s pleasure that he was placed in a high or a low station, but that this belonged to God alone; and farther, that God does not confer so much upon any one as to elevate him to the place of the Head, but distributes his gifts in such a manner, that He alone is glorified in all things.</p>

 			 that whatever there is of excellence in mankind, is not implanted in him by nature, so that it could be ascribed either to nature or to descent; and farther, that it is not acquired by free will, so as to bring God under obligation, but flows from his pure and undeserved mercy.

Now, there is no man that has anything of excellency from himself; 			 therefore the man that extols himself is a fool and an idiot. The true foundation of Christian modesty is this &#8212; not to be self-complacent, as knowing that we are empty and void of everything good &#8212; that, if God has implanted in us anything that is good, we are so much the more debtors to his grace; and in fine, that, as Cyprian says, we must glory in nothing, because there is nothing that is our own.</p>

It is indeed certain that this is the nature and tendency of a father&#8217;s chastisement, to make his son feel ashamed; for the first token of return to a right state of mind is the shame which the son begins to feel on being reproached for his fault. The object, then, which the father has in view when he chastises his son with reproofs, is that he may bring him to be displeased with himself.

Paul then simply affirms that what he had said, had been said by him, with no disposition to upbraid, or with any view to hurt their reputation, but, on the contrary, with paternal affection he admonished them as to what he saw to be 			 defective in them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p50"></A>But what was the design of this admonition? It was that the Corinthians, who were puffed up with mere empty notions, might learn to glory, as he did, in the abasement of the cross, and might no longer despise him on those grounds on which he was deservedly honorable in the sight of God and angels &#8212; in fine, that, laying aside their accustomed haughtiness, they might set a higher value on those <i>marks</i>  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_250"></A><A HREF="#fn_250"><FONT SIZE="1">251</FONT></A>
 			 <i> of Christ </i>(<a name="xi.iii-p51.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017">Ga 6:17</a><a name="xi.iii-p51.5"></A>) that were upon him, than on the empty and counterfeit show of the false apostles. Let teachers  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_251"></A><A HREF="#fn_251"><FONT SIZE="1">252</FONT></A>
 			 infer from this, that in reproofs they must always use such moderation as not to wound men&#8217;s minds with excessive severity, and that, agreeably to the common proverb, they must mix honey or oil with vinegar &#8212; that they must above all things take care not to appear to triumph over those whom they reprove, or to take delight in their disgrace &#8212; nay more, that they must endeavor to make it understood that they seek nothing but that their welfare may be promoted. For what good will the 			 teacher  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_252"></A><A HREF="#fn_252"><FONT SIZE="1">253</FONT></A>
 			 do by mere bawling, if he does not season the sharpness of his reproof by that moderation of which I have spoken? Hence if we are desirous to do any good by <i>correcting </i>men&#8217;s faults, we must distinctly give them to know, that our reproofs proceed from a friendly disposition.</p>

 			  which he had previously found fault with? For while the Corinthians were giants in pride, they were children in faith, and are, therefore, with propriety, sent to <i>pedagogues</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_255"></A><A HREF="#fn_255"><FONT SIZE="1">256</FONT></A>

</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p60"></A><i>For in Christ</i>  Here we have the reason why he alone ought to be esteemed as the <i>father</i> of the Corinthian Church &#8212; because he had <i>begotten</i> it. And truly it is in most appropriate terms that he here describes spiritual generation, when he says that he has <i>begotten them in Christ</i>, who alone is the life of the soul, and makes the gospel the formal cause.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_257"></A><A HREF="#fn_257"><FONT SIZE="1">258</FONT></A>
 			  Let us observe, then, that we are <i>then </i>in the sight of God truly <i>begotten</i>, when we are engrafted into Christ, out of whom there will be found nothing but death, and that this is effected by means of <i>the gospel</i>, because, 			 while we are by nature flesh and hay, the word of God, as Peter (<a name="xi.iii-p61.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024">1 Pet. 1:24</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#025">25</a><a name="xi.iii-p61.2"></A>) teaches from Isaiah, (<a name="xi.iii-p61.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006">Isa. 40:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#007">7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#008">8</a><a name="xi.iii-p61.3"></A>,) is <i>the incorruptible seed </i>by which we are 			 renewed to eternal life. Take away the gospel, and we will all remain accursed and dead in the sight of God. That same word by which we are <i>begotten</i> is afterwards <i>milk </i>to us for nourishing us, and it is also <i>solid food </i>to sustain us 			 for ever.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_258"><FONT SIZE="1">259</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p63"></A>Should any one bring forward this objection, &#8220;As new sons are <i>begotten</i> to God in the Church every day, why does Paul say that those who succeeded him were not <i>fathers</i>?&#8221; the answer is easy &#8212; that he is here speaking of the <i>commencement</i> of the Church. For although many had been <i>begotten</i> by the ministry of others, this honor remained to Paul untouched &#8212; that he had 			 founded the Corinthian Church. Should any one, again, ask, &#8220;Ought not all pastors to be reckoned <i>fathers</i>, and if so, why does Paul deprive all others of this title, so as to claim it for himself exclusively?&#8221; I answer &#8212; &#8220;He speaks here comparatively.&#8221; Hence, however the title of <i>fathers</i> might be applicable to them in other respects, yet in respect of Paul, they were merely <i>instructors</i>  We must also keep in mind what I touched upon a little ago, that he is not speaking of all, (for as to those who were like himself, as, for example, 			 Apollos, Silvanus, and Timotheus, who aimed at nothing but the advancement of Christ&#8217;s kingdom, he would have had no objection to their being so named, and having the highest honor assigned to them,) but is reproving those who, by a misdirected ambition, transferred to themselves the glory that belonged to another. Of this sort were those who robbed Paul of the honor that was due to him, that they might set themselves off in his 			 spoils.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p64"></A>And, truly, the condition of the Church universal at this day is the same as that of the Corinthian Church was at that time. For how few are there that love the Churches with a <i>fatherly</i>, that is to say, a disinterested affection, and lay themselves out to promote their welfare! Meanwhile, there are very many <i>pedagogues</i>, who give out their services as hirelings, in such a manner as to discharge as it were a mere 			 temporary office, and in the meantime hold the people in subjection and admiration.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_259"></A><A HREF="#fn_259"><FONT SIZE="1">260</FONT></A>
 			 At the same time, even in that case it is well when there are many <i>pedagogues</i>, who do good, at least, to some extent by teaching, and do not destroy the Church by the corruptions of false doctrine. For my part, when I complain of the multitude of pedagogues, I do not refer to Popish priests, (for I would not do them the honor of reckoning them in that number,) but those who, while agreeing with us in doctrine, employ themselves in taking care of their own affairs, 			 rather than those of Christ. We all, it is true, wish to be reckoned <i>fathers</i>, and require from others the obedience of sons, but where is the man to be found who acts in such a manner as to show that he is a <i>father</i>?  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_260"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">261</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p67"></A>There remains another question of greater difficulty: As Christ forbids us to</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="xi.iii-p68"></A>call any one father upon earth, because we have one Father in heaven, <br> 			 (<a name="xi.iii-p68.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#009">Mt 23:9</a><a name="xi.iii-p68.2"></A>,)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p69"></A>how does Paul dare to take to himself the name of<i> father</i>? I answer, that, properly speaking, God alone is the Father, not merely of our soul, but also of our flesh. As, however, in so far as concerns the body, he communicates the honor of his paternal name to those to whom he gives offspring, while, as to souls, he reserves to himself exclusively the right and title of 			 Father, I confess that, on this account, he is called in a peculiar sense <i>the Father of spirits</i>, and is distinguished from earthly <i>fathers</i>, as the Apostle speaks in <a name="xi.iii-p69.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009">Heb 12:9</a><a name="xi.iii-p69.1"></A>. As, however, notwithstanding that it is he alone who, by his own influence, begets souls, and regenerates and quickens them, he makes use of the ministry of his servants for this purpose, there is no harm in their being called <i>fathers</i>, in respect of this ministry, as this does not in any degree detract from the honor of God. The word, as I have said, is the 			 spiritual seed. God alone by means of it regenerates our souls by his influence, but, at the same time, he does not exclude the efforts of ministers. If, therefore, you attentively consider, what God accomplishes by himself, and what he designs to be accomplished by ministers, you will easily understand in what sense he alone is worthy of the name of <i>Father</i>, and how far this name is applicable to 			 his ministers, without any infringement upon his rights.</p>  <a name="xi.iv"></A>

 			  At the same time he gives up something in respect of his own right, when he <i>exhorts </i>them to this, by way of entreaty rather than of command.

This limitation must always be observed, so as not to follow any man, except in so far as he leads us to Christ. We know what he is here treating of. The Corinthians did not merely shun the abasement of the cross, but they also regarded their <i>father </i>with contempt, on this 			 account, that, forgetting earthly glory, he gloried rather in reproaches for Christ; and they reckoned themselves and others fortunate in having nothing contemptible according to the flesh. He accordingly admonishes them to devote themselves, after his example, to the service of Christ, so as to endure all things patiently.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xi.iv-p18"></A><a name="xi.iv-p18.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iv-p19"></A><b>17.</b> <i>For this cause.</i> The meaning is: &#8220;That you may know what my manner of life is, and whether I am worthy to be imitated, listen to what Timothy has to say, who will be prepared to be a faithful witness of these things. Now as there are two things that secure credit to a man&#8217;s testimony &#8212; 			 a knowledge of the things which he relates, and fidelity &#8212; he lets them know that Timothy possesses both of these things. For in calling him his <i>dearly beloved son</i>, he intimates that he knew him intimately, and was acquainted with all his affairs; and farther, he speaks of him as <i>faithful in the 			 Lord</i>  He gives also two things in charge to Timothy &#8212; <i>first</i>, to recall to the recollection of the Corinthians those things which they should of themselves have had in remembrance, and in this he tacitly reproves them; and <i>secondly</i>,<i> 			 </i>to testify to them, how uniform and steady his manner of teaching was in every place. Now it is probable that he had been assailed by the calumnies of the false apostles, as though he assumed more authority over the Corinthians than he did over others, or as though he conducted himself in a very different way in other places; for it is not without good reason that he wishes this to be testified to them. It is then the part of a prudent minister so to regulate his 			 procedure, and to observe such a method of instruction, that no such objection may be brought against him, but he shall be prepared to answer on the same ground as Paul does.</p>

Paul, accordingly, with the view of reproving their ill-regulated conscience, and repressing their 			 insolence, tells them, that they cannot endure his presence. It happens sometimes, it is true, that wicked men, on finding opportunity of insulting, rise up openly with an iron front against the servants of Christ, but never do they come forward ingenuously to an equal combat,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_262"></A><A HREF="#fn_262"><FONT SIZE="1">263</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xi.iv-p25"></A>The clause, <i>if the Lord will</i>, intimates, that we ought not to promise anything to others as to the future, or to determine with ourselves, without adding this limitation in so far as <i>the Lord will permit</i> <i> 			 </i>Hence James with good reason derides the rashness of mankind (<a name="xi.iv-p25.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#015">Jas 4:15</a><a name="xi.iv-p25.1"></A>) in planning what they are to do ten years afterwards, while they have not security for living even a single hour. We are not, it is true, bound by a constant necessity to the use of such forms of expression, but it is the better way to accustom ourselves carefully to them, that we may 			 exercise our minds from time to time in this consideration &#8212; that all our plans must be in subjection to the will of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iv-p26"></A><i>And I will know not the speech</i>  By <i>speech </i>you must understand that prating in which the false apostles delighted themselves, for they excelled in a kind of dexterity and gracefulness of speech, while they were destitute of the zeal and efficacy of the Spirit.

 			  of their glory, and on the ground of which they claim for themselves every honor. If they wish to have any honor from me, they must bring forward that <i>power </i>which distinguishes the true servants of Christ from the merely pretended: otherwise I shall despise them, with all their show. It is to no purpose, therefore, that they confide in their eloquence, for I shall reckon it nothing better than smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="xi.iv-p30"></A><b>20.</b> <i>For the kingdom of God is not in word</i>  As the Lord governs the Church by his word, as with a scepter, the administration of the gospel is often called <i>the kingdom of God</i>  Here, then, we are to understand <i>by the kingdom of God</i> whatever tends in this direction, and is appointed for this purpose &#8212; that God may reign among us. He says that this kingdom does not consist in <i>word</i>,<i> 			 </i>for how small an affair is it for any one to have skill to prate eloquently, while he has nothing but empty tinkling.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_265"></A><A HREF="#fn_265"><FONT SIZE="1">266</FONT></A>
 			  Let us know, then, a mere outward gracefulness and dexterity in teaching is like a body that is elegant and of a beautiful color, while the <i>power</i> of which Paul here speaks is like the soul. <i>We </i>have already seen that the preaching of the gospel is of such a nature, that it is inwardly replete with a kind 			 of solid majesty. This majesty shows itself, when a minister strives by means of <i>power</i> rather than of <i>speech</i> &#8212; that is, when he does not place confidence in his own intellect, or eloquence, but, furnished with spiritual armor, consisting of zeal for maintaining the 			 Lord&#8217;s honor &#8212; eagerness for the raising up of Christ&#8217;s kingdom &#8212; a desire to edify &#8212; the fear of the Lord &#8212; an invincible constancy &#8212; purity of conscience, and other necessary endowments, he applies himself diligently to the Lord&#8217;s work. Without this, preaching is dead, and has no strength, with whatever beauty it may be adorned. Hence in his second epistle, he says, that in Christ nothing avails but <i>a new creature </i>(<a name="xi.iv-p31.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017">2Co 5:17</a><a name="xi.iv-p31.2"></A>) &#8212; a statement which is to the same purpose. For he would have us not rest in outward masks, but depend solely on the internal <i>power</i> of the Holy Spirit.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iv-p32"></A>But while in these words he represses the ambition of the false apostles, he at the same time reproves the Corinthians for their perverted judgment, in measuring the servants of Christ by what holds the lowest place among their excellences. Here we have a remarkable statement, and one that is not less applicable to us than to them. As to our gospel, of which we are proud,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_266"></A><A HREF="#fn_266"><FONT SIZE="1">267</FONT></A>

 			 On the contrary, how many there are, who, while endeavoring to procure favor and applause from the gospel, as though it were some profane science, aim at nothing else than to speak with elegance and refinement! I do not approve of restricting the term <i>power </i>to miracles, for from the contrast we may readily gather that it has a more extensive import.</p>

<p><a name="xi.iv-p36"></A><b>21.</b> <i>What will ye</i>? The person who divided the Epistles into chapters ought to have made this the beginning of the <i>fifth </i>chapter. For having hitherto reproved the foolish pride of the Corinthians, their vain 			 confidence, and their judgment as perverted and corrupted by ambition, he now makes mention of the vices with which they were infected, and on account of which they ought to be ashamed &#8212; &#8220;You are puffed up, as though everything were on the best possible footing among you, but it were better if you did with shame and sighing acknowledge the unhappiness of your condition, for if you persist, I shall be under the necessity of laying aside mildness, and exercising towards you a paternal severity.&#8221; 			 There is, however, still more of emphasis in this threatening in which he gives them liberty to choose, for he declares that it does not depend upon himself whether he shall show himself agreeable and mild, but that it is their own fault that he is necessitated to use severity. &#8220;It is for you,&#8221; says he, &#8220;to choose in what temper you would have me. 			 As for me, I am prepared to be mild, but if you go on as you have done hitherto, I shall be under the necessity of taking up the rod.&#8221; He thus takes higher ground, after having laid claim to <i>fatherly </i>authority over them, for it would have been absurd to set out with this threatening, without first opening up the way by what he said, and preparing them for entertaining fears.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iv-p37"></A>By the term <i>rod</i>, he means that severity with which a pastor ought to correct his people&#8217;s faults. He places in contrast with this, <i>love, and the spirit of meekness</i> &#8212; not,<i> 			 </i>as though the father hated the sons whom he chastises, for on the contrary the chastisement proceeds from love, but because by sadness of countenance and harshness of words, he appears as though he were angry with his son. To express myself more plainly &#8212; in one word, a father always, whatever kind of look he may put on, regards his son with affection, but that affection he manifests when he teaches him pleasantly and lovingly; but when, on the other hand, being 			 displeased with his faults, he chastises him in rather sharp terms, or even with the <i>rod</i>, he puts on the appearance of a person in a passion. As then love does not appear when severity of discipline is exercised, it is not without good reason, that Paul here conjoins<i> love</i> with a <i>spirit of meekness</i>  There are some that understand the term <i>rod</i> to mean excommunication &#8212; but, for my part, though I grant them that excommunication 			 is a part of that severity with which Paul threatens the Corinthians, I at the same time extend it farther, so as to include all reproofs that are of a harsher kind.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iv-p38"></A>Observe here what system a good pastor ought to observe; for he ought of his own accord to be inclined to mildness, with the view of drawing to Christ, rather than driving. This mildness, so far as in him lies, he ought to maintain, and never have recourse to bitterness, unless he be compelled to do so. On the other hand, he must not <i>spare the rod</i>,<i> 			 </i>(<a name="xi.iv-p38.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#024">Pr 13:24</a><a name="xi.iv-p38.1"></A>,) when there is need for it, for while those that are teachable and agreeable should be dealt with mildly, sharpness requires to be used in dealing with the refractory and contumacious. We see, too, that the Word of God does not contain mere doctrine, but contains an intermixture of bitter reproofs, so as to supply pastors with a 			 <i>rod</i>  For it often happens, through the obstinacy of the people, that those pastors who are naturally the mildest   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_268"></A><A HREF="#fn_268"><FONT SIZE="1">269</FONT></A>
 			  are constrained to put on, as it were, the countenance of another, and act with rigor and severity.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xi.iii-p56"></A> &#8220;The Greek word <i>pedagogue</i>,&#8221; says <i>Calmet</i>, &#8220;now carries with it an idea approaching to contempt. With no other word to qualify it, it excites the idea of a pedant, who assumes an air of authority over others, which does not belong to him. But among the ancients a pedagogue was a person to whom they committed the care of their children, to lead them, to observe them, and to instruct them in their first rudiments. 				  Thus the office of a pedagogue nearly answered to that of a governor or tutor, who constantly attends his pupil, teaches him, and forms his manners. Paul (<a name="xi.iii-p56.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015">1Co 4:15</a><a name="xi.iii-p56.1"></A>) says: &#8220;For though you have ten thousand instructors (<i>pedagogues</i>) in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers&#8217; &#8212; representing himself as their father in the faith, since he had <i>begotten them in the gospel</i>. The 				  <i>pedagogue</i>, indeed, may have some power and interest in his pupil, but he can never have the natural tenderness of a <i>father </i>for him.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</p> 			 </P>
