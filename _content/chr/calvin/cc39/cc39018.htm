<p class="Normal"><a name="xix.i-p17"></A><a name="xix.i-p17.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.i-p18"></A><b>1.</b><i> Now concerning spiritual things.</i> He goes on to correct another fault. As the Corinthians abused the gifts of God for ostentation and show, and love was little, if at all, regarded, he shows them for what purpose believers are adorned by God with spiritual gifts &#8212; for the edification of their brethren. This 			 proposition, however, he divides into two parts; for, in the <i>first </i>place, he teaches, that God is the author of those gifts, and, <i>secondly, </i>having established this, he reasons as to their design. He proves from their own experience, that those things in which they gloried, are bestowed upon men through the exercise of God&#8217;s favor; for he reminds them how ignorant they were, and stupid, and 			 destitute of all spiritual light, previously to God&#8217;s calling them. Hence it appears, that they had been furnished with them &#8212; not by nature, but through God&#8217;s unmerited benignity.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.i-p19"></A>As to the words; when he says &#8212; <i>I would not that ye should be ignorant,</i> we must supply the expression &#8212; <i>as</i> <i>to what is right, </i>or <i>as to what is your duty, </i>or some 			 similar expression; and by <i>spiritual things </i>he means <i>spiritual gifts, </i>as to which we shall have occasion to see afterwards. In what follows there is a twofold reading; for some manuscripts have simply <a name="xix.i-p19.1"></A>&#8005;&#964;&#953; others add <a name="xix.i-p19.2"></A>&#8005;&#964;&#949;. The former means <i>because</i> &#8212; assigning a reason: the latter means <i>when; </i>and this latter reading suits much better. But besides this diversity, the construction is in other respects confused; but still, the meaning is evident. Literally, it is this &#8212; <i>Ye know, that 			 when ye were Gentiles, after dumb idols, according as ye were led, following</i> I have, however, faithfully given Paul&#8217;s meaning. By <i>dumb idols </i>he means &#8212; having neither feeling nor motion.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.i-p20"></A>Let us learn from this passage how great is the blindness of the human mind: when it is without the illumination of the Holy Spirit, inasmuch as it stands in amazement at <i>dumb idols,</i>  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_725"></A><A HREF="#fn_725"><FONT SIZE="1">726</FONT></A>
 			  and cannot rise higher in searching after God; nay more, it is <i>led </i>by Satan as if it were a brute.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_726"></A><A HREF="#fn_726"><FONT SIZE="1">727</FONT></A>
 			 He makes use of the term <i>Gentiles </i>here, in the same sense as in <a name="xix.i-p22.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012">Eph 2:12</a><a name="xix.i-p22.3"></A>.</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="xix.i-p23"></A>Ye were at one time Gentiles, says he, without God, <br> 			 strangers to the hope of salvation, etc.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.i-p24"></A>Perhaps, too, he reasons by way of contrast. What if  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_727"></A><A HREF="#fn_727"><FONT SIZE="1">728</FONT></A>
 			 they should now show themselves to be less submissive to God, after his having taken them under his care, to be governed by his word and Spirit, than they formerly discovered themselves to be forward and compliant, in following the suggestions of Satan!</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xix.i-p26"></A><a name="xix.i-p26.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.i-p27"></A><b>3.</b> <i>Wherefore I give you to know.</i> Having admonished them from their own experience, he sets before them a general doctrine, which he deduces from it; for what the Corinthians had experienced in themselves is common to all mankind &#8212; to wander on in error,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_728"></A><A HREF="#fn_728"><FONT SIZE="1">729</FONT></A>
 			  previously to their being brought back, through the kindness of God, into the way of truth. Hence it is necessary that we should be directed by the Spirit of God, or we shall wander on for ever. From this, too, it follows, that all things that pertain to the true knowledge of God, are the gifts of the Holy Spirit,. He at the same time derives an argument from opposite causes to opposite effects. <i>No one, speaking 			 by the Spirit of God, can revile Christ; </i>so, on the other hand, <i>no one can speak well of Christ, but by the Spirit of Christ.</i> To <i>say that Jesus is accursed</i> is utter blasphemy against him. To 			 <i>say that Jesus is the Lord, </i>is to speak of him in honorable terms and with reverence, and to extol his majesty.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.i-p29"></A>Here it is asked &#8212; &#8220;As the wicked sometimes speak of Christ in honorable and magnificent terms, is this an indication that they have the Spirit of God?&#8221; I answer &#8212; &#8220;They undoubtedly have, so far as that effect is concerned; but the gift of regeneration is one thing, and the gift of bare intelligence, with which Judas himself was endowed, when he preached the gospel, is quite another.&#8221; Hence, too, we perceive how great our weakness is, as we 			 cannot so much as move our tongue for the celebration of God&#8217;s praise, unless it be governed by his Spirit. Of this the Scripture, also, frequently reminds us, and the saints everywhere acknowledge that unless the Lord open their mouths, they are not fit to be the heralds of his praise. Among others, Isaiah says &#8212; I am a man of unclean lips, etc. (<a name="xix.i-p29.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005">Isa 6:5</a><a name="xix.i-p29.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xix.i-p30"></A><a name="xix.i-p30.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.i-p31"></A><b>4.</b> <i>Now there are diversities of gifts</i> The symmetry of the Church   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_729"></A><A HREF="#fn_729"><FONT SIZE="1">730</FONT></A>
 			  consists, so to speak, of a manifold unity,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_730"></A><A HREF="#fn_730"><FONT SIZE="1">731</FONT></A>
 			  that is, when the variety of gifts is directed to the same object, as in music there are different sounds, but suited to each other with such an adaptation, as to produce concord. Hence it is befitting that there should be a distinction of gifts as well as of offices, and yet all harmonize in one. Paul, accordingly, in <a name="xix.i-p33.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006">Ro 12:6</a><a name="xix.i-p33.2"></A>, commends this 			 variety, that no one may, by rashly intruding himself into another&#8217;s place, confound the distinction which the Lord has established. Hence he orders every one to be contented with his own gifts, and cultivate the particular department that has been assigned to him.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_731"></A><A HREF="#fn_731"><FONT SIZE="1">732</FONT></A>
 			  He prohibits them from going beyond their own limits by a foolish ambition. In fine, he exhorts that every one should consider how much has been given him, what measure has been allotted to him, and to what he has been called. Here, on the other hand, he orders every one to bring what he has to the common heap, and not keep back the gifts of God in the way of enjoying every one his own, apart from the others,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_732"></A><A HREF="#fn_732"><FONT SIZE="1">733</FONT></A>
 			  but aim unitedly at the edification of all in common. In both passages, he brings forward the similitude of the human body, but, as may be observed, on different accounts. The sum of what he states amounts to this &#8212; that gifts are not distributed thus variously among believers, in order that they may be used apart, but that in the division there is a unity, inasmuch as one Spirit is the source of all those gifts, one God is the Lord of all administrations, and the 			 author of all exercises of power. Now God, who is the beginning, ought also to be the end.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.i-p36"></A><i>One Spirit</i> This passage ought to be carefully observed in opposition to fanatics,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_733"></A><A HREF="#fn_733"><FONT SIZE="1">734</FONT></A>
 			  who think that the name Spirit means nothing essential, but merely the gifts or actions of divine power. Here, however, Paul plainly testifies, that there is <i>one </i>essential power of God, whence all his works proceed. The term Spirit, it is true, is sometimes transferred by metonymy to the gifts themselves. Hence we read of the Spirit of knowledge &#8212; of judgment &#8212; of fortitude &#8212; of modesty. 			   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_734"></A><A HREF="#fn_734"><FONT SIZE="1">735</FONT></A>
 			  Paul, however, here plainly testifies that judgment, and knowledge, and gentleness, and all other gifts, proceed from <i>one </i>source. For it is the office of the Holy Spirit to put forth and exercise the power of God by conferring these gifts upon men, and distributing them among them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.i-p39"></A><i>One Lord.</i> The ancients made use of this testimony in opposition to the Arians, for the purpose of maintaining a Trinity of persons. For there is mention made here of <i>the Spirit, </i>secondly of <i>the 			 Lord, </i>and lastly of <i>God</i>, and to these Three, one and the same operation is ascribed. Thus, by the name <i>Lord, </i>they understood Christ. But for my part, though I have no objection to its being understood in this way, I perceive, at the same time, 			 that it is a weak argument for stopping the mouths of Arians; for there is a correspondence between the word <i>administrations </i>and the word <i>Lord. The administrations, </i>says Paul, <i>are different, </i>but there is only one God whom we must serve, whatever <i>administration </i>we discharge. This antithesis, then, 			 shows what is the simple meaning, so that to confine it to Christ is rather forced.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xix.i-p40"></A><a name="xix.i-p40.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.i-p41"></A><b>6.</b> <i>One God that worketh.</i> Where we use the word <i>powers </i>the Greek term is <a name="xix.i-p41.1"></A>&#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#8053;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;<i>, </i>a term which contains an allusion 			 to the verb <i>worketh, </i>as in Latin <a name="xix.i-p41.2"></A><i>effectus</i> (an effect) corresponds with the verb <a name="xix.i-p41.3"></A><i>effectus</i> (to effect.) Paul&#8217;s meaning is, that although believers may be endowed with different powers, they 			 all take their rise from one and the same power on the part of God. Hence the expression employed here &#8212; <i>worketh all things in all </i>&#8212; does not refer to the general providence of God, but to the liberality that he exercises towards us, in bestowing upon every one some gift. The sum is this &#8212; that there is nothing in mankind that is 			 good or praiseworthy but what comes from God alone. Hence it is out of place here to agitate the question &#8212; in what manner God acts in Satan and in reprobates.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xix.i-p42"></A><a name="xix.i-p42.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.i-p43"></A><b>7.</b> <i>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man</i> He now points out the purpose for which God has appointed his gifts, for he does not confer them upon us in vain, nor does he intend that they shall serve the purpose of ostentation. Hence we must inquire as to the purpose for 			 which they are conferred. As to this Paul answers &#8212; (<i>with a view to utility)</i> &#8212; <a name="xix.i-p43.1"></A>&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#966;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;; that is, that the Church may receive advantage thereby. <i>The manifestation of the Spirit</i> may be taken in a passive as well as in an active 			 sense &#8212; in a <i>passive </i>sense, because wherever there is prophecy, or knowledge, or any other gift, the Spirit of God does there <i>manifest</i> himself &#8212; in an <i>active </i>sense, because the Spirit of God, when he enriches us with any gift, unlocks his treasures, for the purpose of 			 <i>manifesting to </i>us those things that would otherwise have been concealed and shut up. The second interpretation suits better. The view taken by Chrysostom is rather harsh and forced &#8212; that this term is used,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_735"></A><A HREF="#fn_735"><FONT SIZE="1">736</FONT></A>
 			  because unbelievers do not recognize God, except by visible miracles.</p>  <a name="xix.ii"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption26"><a name="xix.ii-p1"></A><a name="xix.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008">1 Corinthians 12:8-13</a><a name="xix.ii-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xix.ii-p2"></A><b>8.</b> For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xix.ii-p3"></A><b>8.</b> Huic quidem per Spiritum datur sermo sapientiae, alteri datur sermo cognitionis, secundum eundem Spiritum.</p>

<p><a name="xix.ii-p5"></A><b>9.</b> Alii fides in eodem Spiritu, alii dona sanationum in codera Spritu.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xix.ii-p6"></A><b>10.</b> To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another <i>divers</i> kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xix.ii-p7"></A><b>10.</b> Alii facultates potentiarum, alii autem prophetia, alii autem discretiones spirituum, alii genera linguarum, alii interpretatio linguarum.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xix.ii-p8"></A><b>11.</b> But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xix.ii-p9"></A><b>11.</b> Porroomnia haec efficit unus et idem Spiritus, distribuens seorsum cuique prout vult.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xix.ii-p10"></A><b>12.</b> For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also <i>is</i> Christ.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xix.ii-p11"></A><b>12.</b> Quemadmodum enim corpus unum est, et membra habet multa: onmia autem membra corporis unius quum multa sint, corpus autem est unum: ita et Christus.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xix.ii-p12"></A><b>13.</b> For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether <i>we be</i> Jews or Gentiles, whether <i>we be</i> bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xix.ii-p13"></A><b>13.</b> Etenim per unum Spiritum nos omnes in unum corpus baptizati sumus, sive Iudaei, sive Graeci: sive servi, sive liberi: et omnes in uno Spiritu potum hausimus.</p> 				  			   		    		  
<p><a name="xix.ii-p14"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xix.ii-p15"></A><a name="xix.ii-p15.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.ii-p16"></A><b>8.</b><i> To one is given</i> He now subjoins an enumeration, or, in other words, specifies particular kinds &#8212; not indeed all of them, but such as are sufficient for his present purpose. <i>&#8220;Believers,&#8221; </i>says he, <i>&#8220;are 			 </i>endowed with different gifts, but let every one <i>acknowledge, </i>that he is indebted for whatever he has to the Spirit of God, for he pours forth his gifts as the sun scatters his rays in every direction. As to the <i>difference</i> between these gifts, <i>knowledge</i> (or understanding) and <i>wisdom</i> are taken in different senses in the Scriptures, but here I take them in the way of less and greater, as in <a name="xix.ii-p16.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003">Col 2:3</a><a name="xix.ii-p16.2"></A>, where they are also joined 			 together, when Paul says, that <i>in Christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Knowledge, </i>therefore, in my opinion, means <i>acquaintance with sacred things</i> &#8212; <i>Wisdom, </i>on the other 			 hand, means the perfection of it. Sometimes <i>prudence </i>is put, as it were, in the middle place between these two, and in that case it denotes skill   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_736"></A><A HREF="#fn_736"><FONT SIZE="1">737</FONT></A>
 			  in applying knowledge to some useful purpose. They are, it is true, <i>very </i>nearly allied; but still you observe a difference when they are put together. Let us then take<i> knowledge</i> as meaning <i>ordinary information, </i>and <i>wisdom, 			 </i>as including revelations that are of a more secret and sublime order.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_737"></A><A HREF="#fn_737"><FONT SIZE="1">738</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.ii-p19"></A>The term <i>faith</i> is employed here to mean a special faith, as we shall afterwards see from the context. A special faith is of such a kind as does not apprehend Christ wholly, for redemption, righteousness, and sanctification, but only in so far as miracles are performed in his name. Judas had a faith of this kind, and he wrought miracles 			 too by means of it. Chrysostom distinguishes it in a somewhat different manner, calling it the faith of miracles, not of doctrines.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_738"></A><A HREF="#fn_738"><FONT SIZE="1">739</FONT></A>
 			  This, however, does not differ much from the interpretation previously mentioned. By the <i>gift of healings</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_739"></A><A HREF="#fn_739"><FONT SIZE="1">740</FONT></A>
 			  every one knows what is meant.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.ii-p22"></A>As to the <i>workings of powers,</i> or, as some render it, the <i>operations of influences, </i>there is more occasion for doubt. I am inclined, however, to think, that what is meant is the influence which is exercised against devils, and also against hypocrites. When, 			 therefore, Christ and his Apostles by authority restrained devils, or put them to flight, that was <a name="xix.ii-p22.1"></A>&#7952;&#957;&#8051;&#961;&#947;&#951;&#956;&#945;<i>, (powerful working,) </i>and, in like manner, when Paul smote the sorcerer with blindness, (<a name="xix.ii-p22.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#011">Ac 13:11</a><a name="xix.ii-p22.2"></A>,) and when Peter struck Ananias and Sapphira dead upon the 			 spot with a single word. The gifts of <i>healing </i>and of miracles, therefore, serve to manifest the goodness of God, but this last, his severity for the destruction of Satan.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_740"></A><A HREF="#fn_740"><FONT SIZE="1">741</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.ii-p24"></A><i>By prophecy,</i> I understand the singular and choice endowment of unfolding the secret will of God, so that a Prophet is a messenger, as it were, between God and man.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_741"></A><A HREF="#fn_741"><FONT SIZE="1">742</FONT></A>
 			  My reason for taking this view will be explained more fully afterwards.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.ii-p26"></A>The<i> discerning of spirits, </i>was a clearness of perception in forming a judgment as to those who professed to be <i>something</i>. (<a name="xix.ii-p26.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#036">Ac 5:36</a><a name="xix.ii-p26.1"></A>.) I speak not of that 			 natural wisdom, by which we are regulated in judging. It was a special illumination, with which some were endowed by the gift of God. The use of it was this: that they might not be imposed upon by masks, of mere pretences,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_742"></A><A HREF="#fn_742"><FONT SIZE="1">743</FONT></A>
 			  but might by that spiritual judgment distinguish, as by a particular mark, the true ministers of Christ from the false.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.ii-p28"></A>There was a difference between the <i>knowledge of tongues, </i>and the <i>interpretation</i> of them, for those who were endowed with the former were, in many cases, not acquainted with the language of the 			 nation with which they had to deal. The <i>interpreters</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_743"></A><A HREF="#fn_743"><FONT SIZE="1">744</FONT></A>
 			  rendered foreign tongues into the native language. These endowments they did not at that time acquire by labor or study, but were put in possession of them by a wonderful revelation of the Spirit.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_744"></A><A HREF="#fn_744"><FONT SIZE="1">745</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xix.ii-p34"></A><b>11.</b> <i>One and the same spirit distributing.</i> Hence it follows that those act amiss who, having no concern as to participation, break asunder that holy harmony, that is fitly adjusted in all its parts, only when under the guidance of the same Spirit, all conspire toward one and the same 			 object. He again calls the Corinthians to unity, by reminding them that all have derived from one fountain whatever they possess, while he instructs them, at the same time, that no one has so much as to have enough within himself, so as not to require help from others. For this is what he means by these words &#8212;<i> distributing to every one severally as he willeth</i> The Spirit of God, therefore, distributes them among us, in order that we may make all contribute to the common advantage. To no one does he give all, lest any one, satisfied with his particular portion, should separate himself from others, and live solely for himself. The same idea is intended in the adverb <i>severally, </i>as it is of great importance to understand 			 accurately that diversity by which God unites us mutually to one another.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_745"></A><A HREF="#fn_745"><FONT SIZE="1">746</FONT></A>
 			  Now, when <i>will</i> is ascribed to the Spirit, and that, too, in connection with power, we may conclude from this, that the Spirit is truly and properly God.</p>

<p><a name="xix.ii-p37"></A><b>12.</b> <i>For as the body is one</i> He now derives a similitude from the human body, which he makes use of also in <a name="xix.ii-p37.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#004">Ro 12:4</a><a name="xix.ii-p37.1"></A>; but it is for a different purpose, as I have already stated 			 above. In that passage, he exhorts every one to be satisfied with his own calling, and not to invade another&#8217;s territory; as ambition, curiosity, or some other disposition, induces many to take in hand more than is expedient. Here, however, he exhorts believers to cleave to each other in a mutual distribution of gifts, as they were not conferred upon them by God that every one should enjoy his own separately, but that one should help another. It is usual, however, for any society of men, or 			 congregation, to be called a <i>body, </i>as one city constitutes a <i>body, </i>and so, in like manner, one senate, and one people. Monenius Agrippa,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_746"></A><A HREF="#fn_746"><FONT SIZE="1">747</FONT></A>
 			  too, in ancient times, when desirous to conciliate the Roman people, when at variance with the senate, made use of an apologue, not very unlike the doctrine of Paul here.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_747"></A><A HREF="#fn_747"><FONT SIZE="1">748</FONT></A>
 			  Among Christians, however, the case is very different; for they do not constitute a mere political body, but are the spiritual and mystical body of Christ, as Paul himself afterwards adds. (<a name="xix.ii-p39.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#027">1Co 12:27</a><a name="xix.ii-p39.2"></A>.) The meaning therefore <i>is</i> &#8212; &#8220;Though the members of the body are various, and have different 			 functions, they are, nevertheless, linked together in such a manner that they coalesce in one.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_748"></A><A HREF="#fn_748"><FONT SIZE="1">749</FONT></A>
 			  We, accordingly, who are members of Christ, although we are endowed with various gifts, ought, notwithstanding, to have an eye to that connection which we have in Christ.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.ii-p41"></A><i>So also is Christ</i> The name of Christ is used here instead of the Church, because the similitude was intended to apply not to God&#8217;s only-begotten Son, but to us. It is a passage that is full of choice consolation, inasmuch as he calls the Church <i>Christ; </i>for Christ   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_749"></A><A HREF="#fn_749"><FONT SIZE="1">750</FONT></A>
 			  confers upon us this honor &#8212; that he is willing to be esteemed and recognised, not in himself merely, but also in his members. Hence the same Apostle says elsewhere, (<a name="xix.ii-p42.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023">Eph 1:23</a><a name="xix.ii-p42.2"></A>,) that the Church is his <i>completion,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_750"></A><A HREF="#fn_750"><FONT SIZE="1">751</FONT></A>
 			  as though he would, if separated from his members, be incomplete. And certainly, as Augustine elegantly expresses himself in one part of his writings &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="xix.ii-p44"></A>&#8220;Since we are <i>in </i>Christ a fruit-bearing vine, what are we <i>out of </i>him but dry twigs?&#8221; (<a name="xix.ii-p44.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#004">Joh 15:4</a><a name="xix.ii-p44.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.ii-p45"></A>In this, then, our consolation lies &#8212; that, as he and the Father are one, so we are one with him. Hence it is that his name is applied to us.</p>

<p><a name="xix.ii-p47"></A><b>13.</b> <i>For we are all baptized by one Spirit.</i> Here there is a proof brought forward from the effect of baptism. <i>&#8220;We </i>are,&#8221; says he, <i>&#8220;engrafted </i>by baptism into Christ&#8217;s body, so that we are by 			 a mutual link bound together as members, and live one and the same life. Hence every one, that would remain in the Church of Christ, must necessarily cultivate this fellowship.&#8221; He speaks, however, of the baptism of believers, which is efficacious through the grace of the Spirit, for, in the case of many, baptism is merely in the letter &#8212; the symbol without the reality; but believers, along with the sacrament, receive the reality. Hence, with respect to God, this invariably holds good &#8212; that 			 baptism is an engrafting into the body of Christ, for God in that ordinance does not represent anything but what he is prepared to accomplish, provided we are on our part capable of it. The Apostle, also, observes here a most admirable medium, in teaching that the nature of baptism is &#8212; to connect us with Christ&#8217;s body. Lest any one, however, should imagine, that this is effected by the outward symbol, he adds that it is the work of the Holy Spirit.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.ii-p48"></A><i>Whether Jews or Greeks.</i> He specifies these instances, to intimate, that no diversity of condition obstructs that holy unity which he recommends. This clause, too, is added suitably and appropriately, for envy might at that time arise from two sources &#8212; because the <i>Jews </i>were not willing 			 that the Gentiles should be put upon a level with them; and, where one had some excellence above others, with the view of maintaining his superiority, lie withdrew himself to a distance from his brethren.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.ii-p49"></A><i>We have all drunk in one Spirit.</i> It is literally, &#8220;We have drunk <i>into </i>one Spirit,&#8221; but it would seem that, in order that the two words <a name="xix.ii-p49.1"></A>&#7952;&#957; (in) and <a name="xix.ii-p49.2"></A>&#7953;&#957; (one) might not immediately follow each other, Paul intentionally changed <a name="xix.ii-p49.3"></A>&#7952;&#957; <i>(in) </i>into <a name="xix.ii-p49.4"></A>&#7952;&#953;&#962; <i>(into,) </i>as he is accustomed frequently 			 to do. Hence his meaning seems rather to be, that we are made to drink through the influence, as he had said before, of the Spirit of Christ, than that we have drunk into the same Spirit. It is uncertain, however, whether he speaks here of Baptism or of the Supper. I am rather inclined, however, to understand him as referring to the Supper, as he makes mention of <i>drinking, </i>for I 			 have no doubt that he intended to make an allusion to the similitude of the sign. There is, however, no correspondence between <i>drinking</i> and baptism. Now, though the cup forms but the half of the Supper, there is no difficulty arising from that, for it is a common thing in Scripture to speak of the sacraments by synecdoche.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_751"></A><A HREF="#fn_751"><FONT SIZE="1">752</FONT></A>
 			  Thus he mentioned above in the tenth chapter (<a name="xix.ii-p50.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#017">1Co 10:17</a><a name="xix.ii-p50.1"></A>) simply the <i>bread, </i>making no mention of the cup. The meaning, therefore, will be this &#8212; that participation in the cup has an eye to this &#8212; that we drink, all of us, of the same cup. For in that ordinance we drink of the life-giving 			 blood of Christ, that we may have life in common with him &#8212; which we truly have, when he lives in us by his Spirit. He teaches, therefore, that believers, so soon as they are initiated by the baptism of Christ, are already imbued with a desire of cultivating mutual unity,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_752"></A><A HREF="#fn_752"><FONT SIZE="1">753</FONT></A>
 			  and then afterwards, when they receive the sacred Supper, they are again conducted by degrees to the same unity, as they are all refreshed at the same time with the same drink.</p>  <a name="xix.iii"></A>

Here is a large subject, and a magnificent one;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_761"></A><A HREF="#fn_761"><FONT SIZE="1">762</FONT></A>
 			  but I content myself with having pointed out the way in which the above similitude must be applied to the Church.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.iii-p61"></A><i>Members severally.</i> Chrysostom is of opinion, that this clause is added, because the Corinthians were not the universal Church; but this appears to me rather forced.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_762"></A><A HREF="#fn_762"><FONT SIZE="1">763</FONT></A>
 			  I have sometimes thought that it was expressive of impropriety, as the Latins say <a name="xix.iii-p62.1"></A><i>Quodammodo</i><i>,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_763"></A><A HREF="#fn_763"><FONT SIZE="1">764</FONT></A>
 			  <i>(in a manner.)</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_764"></A><A HREF="#fn_764"><FONT SIZE="1">765</FONT></A>
 			  When, however, I view the whole matter more narrowly, I am rather disposed to refer it to that division of members of which he had made mention. They are then <i>members severally, </i>according as <i>each </i>one has had his portion and definite work assigned him. The context itself leads us to this meaning. In this way <i>severally, 			 </i>and <i>as a whole, </i>will be opposite terms.</p>  <a name="xix.iv"></A>

<p><a name="xix.iv-p13"></A>He has in the beginning of the chapter spoken of <i>gifts: </i>now he begins to treat of <i>offices, </i>and this order it is proper that we should carefully observe. For the Lord did not appoint ministers, without first endowing them with the requisite gifts, and qualifying them for discharging their duty. Hence we must infer, that those are fanatics, and actuated by an evil spirit, who intrude themselves into the Church, while destitute of 			 the necessary qualifications, as many boast that they are under the influence of the Spirit, and glory in a secret call from God, while in the meantime they are unlearned and utterly ignorant. The natural order, on the other hand, is this &#8212; that gifts come before the office to be discharged. As, then, he has taught above, that everything that an individual has received from God, should be made subservient to the common good, so now he declares that offices are distributed in such a manner, that 			 all may together, by united efforts, edify the Church, and each individual according to his measure.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_766"></A><A HREF="#fn_766"><FONT SIZE="1">767</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.iv-p15"></A>28. <i>First, Apostles</i> He does not enumerate all the particular kinds, and there was no need of this, for he merely intended to bring forward some examples. In the fourth Chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians, (<a name="xix.iv-p15.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011">Eph 4:11</a><a name="xix.iv-p15.1"></A>,) there is a fuller enumeration of the offices, that are required for the continued government of the Church. The reason of this I shall assign there, if the Lord shall permit me to advance so far, though even there he does not make mention of them all. As to the passage before us, we must observe, that of the offices which Paul makes mention of, some are perpetual, others temporary. Those that are perpetual, are such as are 			 necessary for the government of the Church; those that are temporary, are such as were appointed at the beginning for the founding of the Church, and the raising up of Christ&#8217;s kingdom; and these, in a short time afterwards, ceased.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.iv-p16"></A>To the <i>first </i>class belongs the office of <i>Teacher, to </i>the <i>second </i>the <i>office</i> of <i>Apostle; </i>for the Lord created the Apostles, that they might spread the gospel throughout the whole world, and he did not assign to each of them certain limits or parishes, but would have them, wherever they went, to discharge the office of ambassadors among all nations and languages. In this respect there is a difference between them and <i>Pastors, </i>who are, in a manner, tied to their particular churches. For the <i>Pastor </i>has not a commission to preach the gospel over the whole world, but to take care of the Church that has been committed to his charge. In his Epistle to the Ephesians he places <i>Evangelists </i>after the <i>Apostles, </i>but here he passes them over; for from the highest order, he passes immediately to <i>Prophets</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.iv-p17"></A>By this term he means, (in my opinion,) not those who were endowed with the gift of prophesying, but those who were endowed with a peculiar gift, not merely for interpreting Scripture, but also for applying it wisely for present use.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_767"></A><A HREF="#fn_767"><FONT SIZE="1">768</FONT></A>
 			 My reason for thinking so is this, that he prefers prophecy to all other gifts, on the ground of its yielding more edification &#8212; a commendation that would not be applicable to the predicting of future events. Farther, when he describes the office of <i>Prophet</i>, or at least treats of what he ought principally to do, he says that he must devote himself to consolation, exhortation, and doctrine. Now these are things that are distinct from prophesyings.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_768"></A><A HREF="#fn_768"><FONT SIZE="1">769</FONT></A>
 			 Let us, then, by <i>Prophets</i> in this passage understand, first of all, eminent interpreters of Scripture, and farther, persons who are endowed with no common wisdom and dexterity in taking a right view of the present necessity of the Church, that they may speak suitably to it, and in this way be, in a manner, ambassadors to communicate the divine will.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.iv-p20"></A>Between them and <i>Teachers</i> this difference may be pointed out, that the office of <i>Teacher</i> consists in taking care that sound doctrines be maintained and propagated, in order that the purity of religion may be kept up in the Church. At the same time, even this term is taken in different 			 senses, and here perhaps it is used rather in the sense of Pastor, unless you prefer, it may be, to take it in a general way for all that are endowed with the gift of teaching, as in <a name="xix.iv-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001">Ac 13:1</a><a name="xix.iv-p20.1"></A>, where also Luke conjoins them with Prophets. My reason for not agreeing with those who make the whole of the office of Prophet consist in the interpretation of Scripture, is this &#8212; that Paul 			 restricts the number of those who ought to speak, to two or three; (<a name="xix.iv-p20.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#029">1Co 14:29</a><a name="xix.iv-p20.2"></A>,) which would not accord with a bare interpretation of Scripture. In fine, my opinion is this &#8212; that the Prophets here spoken of are those who make known the will of God, by applying with dexterity and skill prophecies, threatenings, promises, and the whole doctrine of Scripture, to the 			 present use of the Church. If any one is of a different opinion, I have no objection to his being so, and will not raise any quarrel on that account. For it is difficult to form a judgment as to gifts and offices of which the Church has been so long deprived, excepting only that there are some traces, or shadows of them still to be seen.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.iv-p21"></A>As to <i>powers</i> and <i>gift of healings</i>, I have spoken when commenting on the 12th Chapter of the Romans. Only it must be 			 observed that here he makes mention, not so much of the gifts themselves, as of the administration of them. As the Apostle is here enumerating offices, I do not approve of what Chrysostom says, that <a name="xix.iv-p21.2"></A>&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#955;&#8053;&#968;&#949;&#953;&#962;, that is, <i>helps</i> or <i>aids</i>, consist in supporting the weak. What is it then? Undoubtedly, it is 			 either an office, as well as gift, that was exercised in ancient times, but of which we have at this day no knowledge whatever; or it is connected with the office of Deacon, or in other words, the care of the poor; and this latter idea pleases me better.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_769"></A><A HREF="#fn_769"><FONT SIZE="1">770</FONT></A>
 			  In <a name="xix.iv-p22.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#007">Ro 12:7</a><a name="xix.iv-p22.2"></A>, he makes mention of two kinds of deacons. Of these I have treated when commenting upon that passage.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.iv-p23"></A>By <i>Governments</i> I understand Elders, who had the charge of discipline. For the primitive Church had its Senate,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_770"></A><A HREF="#fn_770"><FONT SIZE="1">771</FONT></A>
 			  for the purpose of keeping the people in propriety of deportment, as Paul shows elsewhere, when he makes mention of two kinds of Presbyters.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_771"></A><A HREF="#fn_771"><FONT SIZE="1">772</FONT></A>
 			  (<a name="xix.iv-p25.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017">1Ti 5:17</a><a name="xix.iv-p25.2"></A>.) Hence <i>government</i> consisted of those Presbyters who excelled others in gravity, experience, and authority.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.iv-p26"></A>Under <i>different kinds of tongues</i> he comprehends both the knowledge of languages, and the gift of interpretation. They were, however, two distinct gifts; because in some cases an individual spoke in different languages, and yet did not understand the language of the Church with which he had to do. This defect was supplied by 			 interpreters.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_772"></A><A HREF="#fn_772"><FONT SIZE="1">773</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xix.iv-p28"></A><a name="xix.iv-p28.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.iv-p29"></A><b>29.</b> <i>Are all Apostles</i>? It may indeed have happened, that one individual was endowed with many gifts, and sustained two of the offices which he has enumerated; nor was there in this any inconsistency. Paul&#8217;s object, however, is to show in the first place, that no one has such a fullness in everything as to have a 			 sufficiency within himself, and not require the aid of others; and secondly, that offices as well as gifts are distributed in such a manner that no one member constitutes the whole body, but each contributing his portion to the common advantage, they then altogether constitute an entire and perfect body. For Paul means here to take away every occasion of proud boasting, base envyings, haughtiness, and contempt of the brethren, malignity, ambition, and everything of that nature.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xix.iv-p30"></A><a name="xix.iv-p30.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xix.iv-p31"></A><b>31.</b> <i>Seek after the more excellent gifts.</i> It might also be rendered &#8212; <i>Value highly</i>; and it would not suit in with the passage, though it makes little difference as to the meaning; for Paul exhorts the Corinthians to esteem and desire those gifts especially, which 			 are most conducive to edification. For this fault prevailed among them &#8212; that they aimed at show, rather than usefulness. Hence prophecy was neglected, while languages sounded forth among them, with great show, indeed, but with little profit. He does not, however, address individuals, as though he wished that every one should aspire at prophecy, or the office of teacher; but simply recommends to them a desire to promote edification, that they may apply themselves the more diligently to those 			 things that are most conducive to edification.</p>
