<p><a name="xxi.i-p16"></A>As he had previously exhorted them to <i>follow after the more excellent gifts, </i>(<a name="xxi.i-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031">1Co 12:31</a><a name="xxi.i-p16.1"></A>,) so he exhorts them now to <i>follow after love,</i> 			   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_805"></A><A HREF="#fn_805"><FONT SIZE="1">806</FONT></A>
 			  for that was the distinguished excellence,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_806"></A><A HREF="#fn_806"><FONT SIZE="1">807</FONT></A>
 			  which he had promised that he would show them. They will, therefore, regulate themselves with propriety in the use of gifts, if <i>love </i>prevails among them. For he tacitly reproves the want of <i>love, </i>as appearing in this &#8212; that they had hitherto abused their gifts, and, inferring from what goes before, that where they do not assign to <i>love 			 </i>the chief place, they do not take the right road to the attainment of true excellence, he shows them how foolish their ambition is, which frustrates their hopes and desires.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p19"></A>1. <i>Covet spiritual gifts.</i> Lest the Corinthians should object that they wronged God, if they despised his gifts, the Apostle anticipates this objection by declaring, that it was not his design to draw them away even from those gifts that they had abused &#8212; nay rather he commends the pursuit 			 of them, and wishes them to have a place in the Church. And assuredly, as they had been conferred for the advantage of the Church, man&#8217;s abuse of them ought not to give occasion for their being thrown away as useless or injurious, but in the meantime he commends <i>prophecy</i> above all other gifts, as it was the most useful of them all. He observes, therefore, an admirable medium, by 			 disapproving of nothing that was useful, while at the same time he exhorts them not to prefer, by an absurd zeal, things of less consequence to what was of primary importance. Now he assigns the first place to <i>prophecy. Covet, </i>therefore, <i>spiritual gifts </i>&#8212;<i> that 			 </i>is, &#8220;Neglect no gift, for I exhort you to seek after them all, provided only <i>prophecy </i>holds the first place.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xxi.i-p20"></A><a name="xxi.i-p20.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p21"></A><b>2.</b> <i>For he that speaketh in another</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_807"></A><A HREF="#fn_807"><FONT SIZE="1">808</FONT></A>
 			  <i>tongue, speaketh,</i> etc. He now shows from the effect, why it was that he preferred <i>prophecy</i> to other gifts, and he compares it with the gift of <i>tongues, </i>in which it is probable the 			 Corinthians exercised themselves the more, because it had more of show connected with it, for when persons hear a man speaking in a foreign tongue, their admiration is commonly <i>excited. </i>He accordingly shows, from principles already assumed, how perverse a thing this is, inasmuch as it does not at all contribute to the edifying of the Church. He says in the outset &#8212; He <i>that speaketh in another 			 tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto God: </i>that is, according to the proverb, &#8220;He sings to himself and to the Muses.&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_808"></A><A HREF="#fn_808"><FONT SIZE="1">809</FONT></A>
 			  In the use of the word <i>tongue, </i>there is not a <i>pleonasm,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_809"></A><A HREF="#fn_809"><FONT SIZE="1">810</FONT></A>
 			  as in those expressions &#8212; &#8220;She spake thus <i>with her mouth,&#8221; </i>and <i>&#8220;I </i>caught the sound <i>with these ears.&#8221; </i>The term denotes <i>a foreign language. 			 </i>The reason why he does not speak to men is &#8212; because <i>no one heareth,</i> that is, <i>as an articulate voice. </i>For all hear a sound, but they do not understand what is said.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p25"></A>He <i>speaketh in the Spirit</i> &#8212; <i>that </i>is, &#8220;<i>by a </i>spiritual gift, (for in this way I interpret it along with Chrysostom.) He speaketh <i>mysteries </i>and hidden things, and things, therefore, that are 			 of no profit.&#8221; Chrysostom understands <i>mysteries </i>here in a good sense, as meaning &#8212; special revelations from God. I understand the term, however, in a bad sense, as meaning &#8212; dark sayings, that are obscure and involved, as if he had said, <i>&#8220;He </i>speaks what no one <i>understands.&#8221;</i></p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xxi.i-p26"></A><a name="xxi.i-p26.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p27"></A><b>3.</b> <i>He that prophesieth, speaketh unto men</i> &#8220;Prophecy,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is profitable to all, while a foreign language is a treasure hid in the earth. What great folly, then, it is to spend all one&#8217;s time in what is useless, and, on the other hand, to neglect what appears 			 to be most useful!&#8221; To <i>speak to edification, </i>is to speak what contains doctrine fitted to edify. For I understand this term to mean doctrine, by which we are trained to piety, to faith, to the worship and fear of God, and the duties of holiness and righteousness. As, however, we have for the most part need of goads, while others are pressed down by afflictions, or labor under weakness, he adds to doctrine, <i>exhortation and consolation</i> It appears from this passage, and from what goes before, that <i>prophecy </i>does not mean the gift of foretelling future events: but as I have said this once before, I do not repeat it.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xxi.i-p28"></A><a name="xxi.i-p28.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p29"></A><b>4.</b> <i>He that speaketh in another tongue, edifieth himself. In </i>place of what he had said before &#8212; that he <i>speaketh unto God, </i>he now says &#8212; he <i>speaketh to himself</i> But whatever is done in the Church, ought to be for the common benefit. Away, then, with that <i>misdirected </i>ambition, which gives occasion for the advantage of the people generally being hindered! Besides, Paul speaks by way of concession: for when ambition makes use of such empty vauntings,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_810"></A><A HREF="#fn_810"><FONT SIZE="1">811</FONT></A>
 			  there is inwardly no desire of doing good; but Paul does, in effect, order away from the common society of believers those men of mere show, who look only to themselves.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xxi.i-p31"></A><a name="xxi.i-p31.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p32"></A><b>5.</b> <i>I would that ye all spake with tongues</i> Again he declares that he does not give such a <i>preference </i>to prophecy, as not to leave some place for foreign tongues. This must be carefully observed. For God has conferred nothing upon his 			 Church in vain, and languages were of some benefit.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_811"></A><A HREF="#fn_811"><FONT SIZE="1">812</FONT></A>
 			  Hence, although the Corinthians, by a misdirected eagerness for show, had rendered that gift partly useless and worthless, and partly even injurious, yet Paul, nevertheless, commends the use of tongues. So far is he from wishing them abolished or thrown away. At the present day, while a knowledge of languages is more than simply necessary, and while God has at this time, in his wonderful kindness, brought them forward from darkness into light, there are at present 			 great theologians, who declaim against them with furious zeal. As it is certain, that the Holy Spirit has here honored the use of tongues with never-dying praise, we may very readily gather, what is the kind of spirit that actuates those reformers,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_812"></A><A HREF="#fn_812"><FONT SIZE="1">813</FONT></A>
 			  who level as many reproaches as they can against the pursuit of them. At the same time the cases are very different. For Paul takes in languages of any sort &#8212; such as served merely for the publication of the gospel among all nations. They, on the other hand, condemn those languages, from which, as fountains, the pure truth of scripture is to be drawn. An exception is added &#8212; that we must not be so taken up with the use of languages, as to treat with neglect 			 <i>prophecy, </i>which ought to have the first place.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p35"></A><i>Unless he interpret.</i> For if interpretation is added, there will then be prophecy. You must not, however, understand Paul to give liberty here to any one to <i>take </i>up the time of the Church to no profit by muttering words in a foreign tongue. For how ridiculous it were, to repeat the same 			 thing in a variety of languages without any necessity! But it often happens, that the use of a foreign tongue is seasonable. In short, let us simply have an eye to this as our end &#8212; that edification may redound to the Church.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xxi.i-p36"></A><a name="xxi.i-p36.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p37"></A><b>6.</b> <i>Now, brethren, if I should come. He </i>proposes himself as an example, because in his person the case was exhibited more strikingly   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_813"></A><A HREF="#fn_813"><FONT SIZE="1">814</FONT></A>
 			  The Corinthians experienced in themselves abundant fruit from his doctrine. He asks them, then, of what advantage it would be to them, if he were to make use of foreign languages among them. He shows them by this instance, how much better it were to apply their minds to prophesyings. Besides, it was less invidious to reprove this vice in his own person, than in that of another.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p39"></A>He mentions, however, four different kinds of edification &#8212; <i>revelation, knowledge, prophesying, </i>and <i>doctrine</i> As there are a variety of opinions among interpreters respecting them, let me be permitted, also, to bring forward my conjecture. As, however, it is but a conjecture, I leave my readers to judge of it. <i>Revelation</i> and <i>prophesying I </i>put in one class, and I am 			 of opinion that the latter is the administration of the former. I am of the same opinion as to <i>knowledge</i> and <i>doctrine</i> What, therefore, any one has obtained by <i>revelation, 			 </i>he dispenses by <i>prophesying. Doctrine </i>is the way of communicating knowledge. Thus a <i>Prophet</i> will be &#8212; one who interprets and administers <i>revelation. 			 </i>This is rather in favor of the definition that I have given above, than at variance with it. For we have said that <i>prophesying</i> does not consist of a simple and bare interpretation of Scripture, but includes also <i>knowledge</i> for applying it to present use &#8212; which is 			 obtained only by <i>revelation, </i>and the special inspiration of God.</p>  <a name="xxi.ii"></A>

<p><a name="xxi.ii-p26"></A><b>7.</b> <i>Nay even things without life.</i> He brings forward similitudes, first from musical instruments, and then afterwards from the nature of things generally, there being no voice that has not some peculiarity, suitable for distinction.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_814"></A><A HREF="#fn_814"><FONT SIZE="1">815</FONT></A>
 			  <i>&#8220;Even things without life,&#8221; </i>says he, <i>&#8220;instruct </i>us.&#8221; There are, it is true, many random sounds or crashes, without any modulation,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_815"></A><A HREF="#fn_815"><FONT SIZE="1">816</FONT></A>
 			  but Paul speaks here of voices in which there is something of art, as though he had said &#8212; &#8220;A man cannot give life to a harp or flute, but he makes it give forth a sound that is regulated in such a manner, that it can be distinguished. How absurd then it is, that even men, endowed with intelligence, should utter a confused, indistinguishable sound!&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p29"></A>We must not, however, enter here upon any minute discussion as to musical harmonies, inasmuch as Paul has merely taken what is commonly understood; as, for example, the sound of the trumpet,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_816"></A><A HREF="#fn_816"><FONT SIZE="1">817</FONT></A>
 			 of which he speaks shortly afterwards; for it is so much calculated to raise the spirits, that it rouses up &#8212; not only men, but even horses. Hence it is related in historical records, that the Lacedemonians, when joining battle, preferred the use of the flute,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_817"></A><A HREF="#fn_817"><FONT SIZE="1">818</FONT></A>
 			 lest the army should, at the first charge, rush forward upon the enemy with too keen an onset.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_818"></A><A HREF="#fn_818"><FONT SIZE="1">819</FONT></A>
 			 In fine, we all know by experience what power music has in exciting men&#8217;s feelings, so that Plato affirms, and not without good reason, that music has very much effect in influencing, in one way or another, the manners of a state. To speak into the air is to beat the air (<a name="xxi.ii-p32.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026">1Co 9:26</a><a name="xxi.ii-p32.1"></A>) to no purpose. &#8220;Thy voice will not reach either God or man, but will vanish into air.&#8221;</p>

 			  He now speaks in a more general way, for he now takes in the natural voices of animals. He uses the term <i>dumb</i> here, to mean <i>confused</i> &#8212; as opposed to an articulate voice; for the barking of dogs differs from the neighing of horses, and the 			 roaring of lions from the braying of asses. Every kind of bird, too, has its own particular way of singing and chirping. The whole order of nature, therefore, as appointed by God, invites us to observe a distinction.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_820"></A><A HREF="#fn_820"><FONT SIZE="1">821</FONT></A>

 			  The tongue ought to be an index of the mind &#8212; not merely in the sense of the proverb, but in the sense that is explained by Aristotle in the commencement of his book &#8212; &#8220;On Interpretation.&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_822"></A><A HREF="#fn_822"><FONT SIZE="1">823</FONT></A>
 			  How foolish then it is and preposterous in a man, to utter in an assembly a voice of which the hearer understands nothing &#8212; in which he perceives no token from which he may learn what the person means! It is not without good reason, therefore, that Paul views it as the height of absurdity, that a man should be a <i>barbarian </i>to the hearers, by chattering in an unknown tongue, and at the same time he elegantly treats 			 with derision the foolish ambition of the Corinthians, who were eager to obtain praise and fame by this means. &#8220;This reward,&#8221; says he, &#8220;you will earn &#8212; that you will be a <i>barbarian.&#8221; </i>For the term <i>barbarian, </i>whether it be an artificial one, (as Strabo 			 thinks,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_823"></A><A HREF="#fn_823"><FONT SIZE="1">824</FONT></A>
 			 ) or derived from some other origin, is taken in a bad sense. Hence the Greeks, who looked upon themselves as the only persons who were good speakers, and had a polished language, gave to all others the name of <i>barbarians, </i>from their rude and rustic dialect. No language, however, is so cultivated as not to be reckoned barbarous, when it is not 			 understood. &#8220;<i>He that heareth,&#8221; </i>says Paul, &#8220;<i>will </i>be unto me a <i>barbarian, </i>and I will be so to him in return.&#8221; By these words he intimates, that to speak in an unknown tongue, is not to hold fellowship with the Church, 			 but rather to keep aloof from it, and that he who will act this part, will be deservedly despised by others, because <i>he </i>first despises <i>them.</i></p>

Paul, however, does not hereby give permission to any one to cherish an ambition to excel, even to the benefit of the Church, but by correcting the fault, he shows how far short they come of what they are in pursuit of, and at the same time lets them know who they are that should be most highly esteemed. He 			 would have a man to be held in higher estimation, in proportion as he devotes himself with eagerness to promote edification. In the meantime, it is our part to have this one object in view &#8212; that the Lord may be exalted, and that his kingdom may be, from day to day, enlarged.</p>

 			  he employs here, by metonymy, to denote <i>spiritual</i> <i>gifts, </i>as the <i>spirit</i> of doctrine, or of understanding, or of judgment, 			 is employed to denote spiritual doctrine, or understanding, or judgment.

 			  While this example, too, serves to confirm what he has previously maintained, it forms, at the same time, in my opinion, an additional particular. For it is probable that the Corinthians had been in fault in this respect also, that, as they discoursed, so they also prayed in foreign tongues. At the same time, both abuses took their rise from the same source, as indeed they were comprehended under one class. What is meant by <i>praying in a tongue,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_827"></A><A HREF="#fn_827"><FONT SIZE="1">828</FONT></A>
 			  appears from what goes before &#8212; to frame a prayer in a foreign language.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p53"></A>The meaning of the term <i>spirit, </i>however, is not so easily explained. The idea of Ambrose, who refers it to the Spirit that we receive in baptism, has not only no foundation, but has not even the appearance of it. Augustine takes it in a more refined way, as denoting that apprehension, which conceives ideas and 			 signs of things, so that it is a faculty of the soul that is inferior to the understanding. There is more plausibility in the opinion of those who interpret it as meaning the breathing of the throat &#8212; that is, the breath. This interpretation, however, does not accord with the meaning which the term invariably bears in Paul&#8217;s discussion in this place: nay more, it appears to have been repeated the oftener by way of concession. For they gloried in that honorary distinction, which Paul, it is 			 true, allows them, while, on the other hand, he shows how preposterous it is to abuse   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_828"></A><A HREF="#fn_828"><FONT SIZE="1">829</FONT></A>
 			  a thing that is good and <i>excellent. </i>It is as though he had said &#8212; &#8220;Thou makest thy boast to me of <i>spirit, </i>but to what purpose, if it is useless?&#8221; From this consideration, I am led to agree with Chrysostom, as to the meaning of this term, who explains it, as in the previous instance, (<a name="xxi.ii-p54.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#012">1Co 14:12</a><a name="xxi.ii-p54.2"></A>,) to mean a spiritual gift. Thus <i>my spirit </i>will <i>mean</i> &#8212; <i>the gift conferred upon me.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_829"></A><A HREF="#fn_829"><FONT SIZE="1">830</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p56"></A>But here a new question arises; for it is not <i>credible </i>(at least we nowhere read of it) that any spoke under the influence of the Spirit in a language that was to themselves unknown. For the gift of tongues was conferred &#8212; not for the mere purpose of uttering a sound, but, on the contrary, with the view of making a communication. For how ridiculous a thing it would be, that 			 the tongue of a Roman should be framed by the Spirit of God to pronounce Greek words, which were altogether unknown to the speaker, as parrots, magpies, and crows, are taught to mimic human voices! If, on the other hand, the man who was endowed with the gift of tongues, did not speak without sense and understanding, Paul would have had no occasion to say, that <i>the spirit prays, but the understanding is unfruitful, </i>for the <i>understanding</i> must have been conjoined with the <i>spirit</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p57"></A>I answer, that Paul here, for the sake of illustration, makes a supposition, that had no reality, in this way: &#8220;If the gift of tongues be disjoined from the understanding, so that he who speaks is a <i>barbarian</i> to himself, as well as to others, what good would he do by babbling in this manner?&#8221; For it does not, 			 appear that the mind is here said to be <i>unfruitful, (</i><a name="xxi.ii-p57.1"></A>&#7940;&#954;&#945;&#961;&#960;&#959;&#957;<i>) </i>on the ground of no advantage accruing to the Church, inasmuch as Paul is here speaking of the private prayers of an individual. Let us therefore keep it in view, that things that are connected with each other are here 			 disjoined for the sake of illustration &#8212; not on the ground that it either can, or usually does, so happen. The meaning is now obvious. &#8220;If, therefore, I frame prayers in a language that is not understood by me, and the <i>spirit</i> supplies me with words, the <i>spirit</i> indeed 			 itself, which regulates my tongue, will in that case <i>pray, </i>but my mind will either be wandering somewhere else, or at least will have no part in the prayer.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p58"></A>Let us take notice, that Paul reckons it a great fault if the mind is not occupied in prayer. And no wonder; for what else do we in prayer, but pour out our thoughts and desires before God? Farther, as prayer is the spiritual worship of God, what is more at variance with the nature of it, than that it should proceed merely from the lips, and not from the inmost soul? And these things must have been perfectly familiar to every mind, had not 			 the devil besotted the world to such a degree, as to make men believe that they pray aright, when they merely make their lips move. So obstinate, too, are Papists in their madness, that they do not merely justify the making of prayers without understanding, but even prefer that the unlearned should mutter in unknown mumblings.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_830"></A><A HREF="#fn_830"><FONT SIZE="1">831</FONT></A>
 			 Meanwhile they mock God by an acute sophism  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_831"></A><A HREF="#fn_831"><FONT SIZE="1">832</FONT></A>
 			 &#8212; that the <i>final intention </i>is enough, or, in other words, that it is an acceptable service to God, if a Spaniard curses God in the German language, while in his mind he is tossed with various profane cares, provided only he shall, by setting himself to his form of prayer, make up matters with God by means of a thought that quickly vanishes.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_832"></A><A HREF="#fn_832"><FONT SIZE="1">833</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xxi.ii-p65"></A>When he says, I <i>will sing Psalms, </i>or, I <i>will sing,</i> he makes use of a particular instance, instead of a general statement.

 			  &#8212; <i>blessing God, </i>or <i>rendering thanks </i>to him, for in our supplications, we either ask something from God, or we acknowledge some blessing that has been conferred upon us. From this passage, however, we at the same time infer, that the custom of singing was, even at that time, in use among believers, as 			 appears, also, from Pliny, who, writing at least forty years, or thereabouts, after the death of Paul, mentions, that the Christians were accustomed to sing Psalms to Christ before day-break.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_835"></A><A HREF="#fn_835"><FONT SIZE="1">836</FONT></A>
 			  I have also no doubt, that, from the very first, they followed the custom of the Jewish Church in singing Psalms.</p>

<p><a name="xxi.ii-p69"></A><b>16</b>  <i>Else, if thou wilt bless with the spirit.</i> Hitherto he has been showing, that the prayers of every one of us will be vain and unfruitful, if the understanding does not go along with the voice. He now comes to speak of public prayers also. &#8220;If he that frames or utters forth prayers in the name of the people is not understood by the assembly, how will the common people add an expression of their desires in the close, so as to take part in them? For there is no fellowship in prayer, unless when all with one mind unite in the same desires. The same remark applies to <i>blessing, </i>or giving thanks to God.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p70"></A>Paul&#8217;s expression, however, intimates,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_836"></A><A HREF="#fn_836"><FONT SIZE="1">837</FONT></A>
 			  that some one of the ministers uttered or pronounced prayers in a distinct voice, and that the whole assembly followed in their minds the words of that one person, until he had come to a close, and then they all said <i>Amen</i> &#8212; <i>to </i>intimate, that the prayer offered up by that one person was that of all of them in common.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_837"></A><A HREF="#fn_837"><FONT SIZE="1">838</FONT></A>
 			  It is known, that <i>Amen</i> is a Hebrew word, derived from the same term from which comes the word that signifies <i>faithfulness </i>or <i>truth.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_838"></A><A HREF="#fn_838"><FONT SIZE="1">839</FONT></A>
 			  It is, accordingly, a token of confirmation,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_839"></A><A HREF="#fn_839"><FONT SIZE="1">840</FONT></A>
 			  both in alarming, and in desiring.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_840"></A><A HREF="#fn_840"><FONT SIZE="1">841</FONT></A>
 			  Farther, as the word was, from long use, familiar among the Jews, it made its way from them to the Gentiles, and the Greeks made use of it as if it had belonged originally to their own language. Hence it came to be a term in common use among all nations. Now Paul says &#8212; &#8220;If in public prayer thou makest use of a foreign tongue, that is not understood by the<i> unlearned 			 </i>and the common people among whom thou speakest, there will be no fellowship, and thy <i>prayer </i>or <i>blessing </i>will be no longer a public one.&#8221; &#8220;Why?&#8221; &#8220;No one,&#8221; says he, &#8220;<i>can </i>add his <i>Amen to </i>thy prayer or psalm, if 			 he does not understand it.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p76"></A>Papists, on the other hand, reckon that to be a sacred and legitimate observance, which Paul so decidedly rejects. In this they discover an amazing impudence. Nay more, this is a clear token from which we learn how grievously, and with what unbridled liberty, Satan rages in the dogmas of Popery.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_841"></A><A HREF="#fn_841"><FONT SIZE="1">842</FONT></A>
 			  For what can be clearer than those words of Paul &#8212; than an <i>unlearned</i> person cannot take any part in public prayer if he does not understand what is said? What can be plainer than this prohibition &#8212; &#8220;let not prayers or thanksgivings be offered up in public, except in the vernacular tongue.&#8221; In doing every day, what Paul says should not, or even cannot, 			 be done, do they not reckon <i>him </i>to be <i>illiterate</i>? In observing with the utmost strictness what he forbids, do they not deliberately contemn God? We see, then, how Satan sports among them with impunity. Their diabolical obstinacy shows itself in this &#8212; that, when admonished, they are so far from repenting, that they defend this gross abuse by fire 			 and sword.</p>  <a name="xxi.iii"></A>

What dreadful madness is this &#8212; to pursue eagerly with their whole desire, what, in the sight of God, is regarded as a curse! That we may, however, understand more accurately Paul&#8217;s meaning, we must, observe, that this statement is grounded on the testimony of Isaiah, which he immediately afterwards subjoins.

And as interpreters have been misled, from not observing the connection to be of this nature, to prevent all mistake, we shall first explain the passage in Isaiah, and then we shall come to Paul&#8217;s words.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p25"></A>In that chapter the Prophet, inveighs with severity against the ten tribes, which had abandoned themselves to every kind of wickedness. The only consolation is, that God had still a people uncorrupted in the tribe of Judah; but straightway he deplores the corruption of that tribe also; and he does so the more sharply, because there was no hope of amendment. For thus he speaks in the name of God &#8212; <i>Whom shall I teach knowledge? those that are weaned from their mother? those that are drawn from the breasts</i> By this he means, that they are no more capable of instruction than little children but lately weaned.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p26"></A>It is added &#8212; <i>Precept upon precept, instruction upon instruction, charge upon charge, direction upon direction, here a little, and there a little</i> In these words he expresses, in the style of a mimic,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_842"></A><A HREF="#fn_842"><FONT SIZE="1">843</FONT></A>
 			  the slowness and carelessness by which they were kept back. &#8220;In teaching them, I lose my labor, for they make no progress, because they are beyond measure uncultivated, and what they had been taught by means of long-continued labor, they in a single moment forget.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p28"></A>It is added still farther &#8212; <i>He that speaketh to that people is like one that maketh use of stammering lips, and a foreign language</i> This is the passage that Paul quotes. Now the meaning is,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_843"></A><A HREF="#fn_843"><FONT SIZE="1">844</FONT></A>
 			  that the people have been visited with such blindness and madness, that they no more understand God when speaking to them, than they would some barbarian or foreigner, stammering in an unknown tongue &#8212; which is a dreadful curse. He has not, however, quoted the Prophet&#8217;s words with exactness, because he reckoned it enough to make a pointed reference to the passage, that the Corinthians, on being admonished, might attentively consider it. As to his saying that it was 			 <i>written in the law,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_844"></A><A HREF="#fn_844"><FONT SIZE="1">845</FONT></A>
 			  this is not at variance with common usage; for the Prophets had not a ministry distinct from the law, but were the interpreters of the law, and their doctrine is, as it were, a sort of appendage to it; hence the law included the whole body of Scripture, up to the advent of Christ. Now Paul from this infers as follows &#8212; &#8220;Brethren, it is necessary to guard against that childishness, which is so severely reproved by the Prophet &#8212; that the word 			 of God sounds in your ears without any fruit. Now, when you reject prophecy, which is placed within your reach, and prefer to stand amazed at empty sound, is not this voluntarily to incur the curse of God?   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_845"></A><A HREF="#fn_845"><FONT SIZE="1">846</FONT></A>

Paul would have all believers to be, as far as possible, in full maturity as to <i>understanding</i> The Pope, inasmuch as it is 			 easier to govern asses than men, gives orders, under pretext of simplicity, that all under him shall remain uninstructed.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_846"></A><A HREF="#fn_846"><FONT SIZE="1">847</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xxi.iii-p37"></A>Taking it in a general way, the meaning will be <i>&#8220;Tongues, </i>in so far as they are given <i>for a sign</i> &#8212; that is, for a miracle &#8212; are appointed not properly for <i>believers, 			 </i>but for <i>unbelievers.&#8221; </i>The advantages derived from <i>tongues</i> were various. They provided against necessity &#8212; that diversity of <i>tongues</i> might not prevent the Apostles from disseminating the gospel over the whole world: 			 there was, consequently, no nation with which they could not hold fellowship. They served also to move or terrify <i>unbelievers </i>by the sight of a miracle &#8212; for the design of this miracle, equally with others, was to prepare those who were as yet at a distance from Christ for rendering obedience to him. Believers, who had already devoted themselves to his doctrine, did not stand so much in need of such preparation. Hence, the Corinthians brought 			 forward that gift improperly and out of its right place, allowing prophecy in the meantime to be neglected, which was peculiarly and specially set apart for <i>believers, </i>and ought, therefore, to be familiar to them, for in <i>tongues</i> they looked to nothing farther than the miracle.</p>

<p><a name="xxi.iii-p39"></A><b>23.</b> <i>If therefore the whole Church come together</i> As they did not see their fault, in consequence of having their minds pre-occupied with a foolish and depraved desire, he tells them that they will be exposed to the scorn of the wicked or the unlearned, if any, on coming into their 			 assembly, should hear them uttering a sound, but not speaking. For what unlearned person will not reckon those to be out of their right mind, who, in place of speech, utter empty sound, and are taken up with that vanity, while they were gathered together for the purpose of hearing the doctrine of God? This statement has much that is cutting: &#8220;You applaud yourselves in your own sleeve; but the wicked and the unlearned laugh at your fooleries. You 			 do not, therefore, see what to the unlearned and unbelieving is <i>perfectly </i>manifest.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p class="Super"><a name="xxi.iii-p40"></A>Here Chrysostom starts a question&#8217; &#8220;If <i>tongues</i> were given to unbelievers <i>for a sign, </i>why does the Apostle say now, that they will be derided by them?&#8221; He answers, that they are 			 <i>for a sign</i> to fill them with astonishment &#8212; not to instruct them, or to reform them. At the same time he adds, that it is owing to their wickedness, that they look upon the sign as madness. This explanation does not satisfy me; for however an unbeliever or unlearned person may be affected by a miracle, and may regard with reverence the gift of God, he does not cease on that 			 account to deride and condemn an unseasonable abuse of the gift,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_848"></A><A HREF="#fn_848"><FONT SIZE="1">849</FONT></A>
 			  and think thus with himself: &#8220;What do these men mean, by wearying out themselves and others to no purpose? Of what avail is their speaking, if nothing is to be learned from it?&#8221; Paul&#8217;s meaning, therefore, is &#8212; that the Corinthians would be justly <i>convicted </i>of madness by the unbelieving and unlearned, however much they might please themselves. 			   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_849"></A><A HREF="#fn_849"><FONT SIZE="1">850</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xxi.iii-p44"></A><b>24.</b> <i>But if all prophesy</i> As he had previously showed them, how much more advantageous prophecy is to <i>those that are of the household of faith </i>(<a name="xxi.iii-p44.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010">Ga 6:10</a><a name="xxi.iii-p44.1"></A>) than the gift of tongues, so he now shows that it would be useful also to <i>those that are without. </i>(<a name="xxi.iii-p44.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#013">1Co 5:13</a><a name="xxi.iii-p44.2"></A>.) This is a most powerful consideration for showing the Corinthians their error. For what a base part it is to depreciate a gift that is most useful both within and without, and 			 to be wholly taken up with another gift which is useless to those that are <i>within </i>the house; and, in addition to this, gives occasion of offense to those that are <i>without. </i>He sets before them this advantage of prophecy, that it summons the <i>consciences </i>of the wicked to the tribunal of God, and strikes them with a lively apprehension of divine 			 judgment in such a manner, that he who before in utter regardlessness despised sound doctrine, is constrained to give glory to God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p45"></A><i>We </i>shall find it, however, much easier to understand this passage, if we compare it with another that occurs in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a name="xxi.iii-p45.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012">Heb 4:12</a><a name="xxi.iii-p45.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="xxi.iii-p46"></A>The Word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword; piercing to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow &#8212; a discerner of the thoughts of the heart.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_850"></A><A HREF="#fn_850"><FONT SIZE="1">851</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p48"></A>For in both passages, it is the same kind of efficacy of the Word of God that is spoken of: only in that other passage it is spoken of more fully and distinctly. So far as the passage before us is concerned, it is not difficult to understand now, what is meant by being <i>convinced </i>and <i>judged. </i>The consciences of men are in a torpid state,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_851"></A><A HREF="#fn_851"><FONT SIZE="1">852</FONT></A>
 			 and are not touched with any feeling of dissatisfaction on account of their sins, so long as they are enveloped in the darkness of ignorance. In short, unbelief is like a lethargy that takes away feeling. But the Word of God penetrates even to the farthest recesses of the mind, and by introducing, as it were, a light, dispels darkness, and drives away that deadly torpor. Thus, then, unbelievers are <i>convinced, </i>inasmuch as they are seriously affected and alarmed, on coming to 			 know that they have to do with God; and, in like manner, they are <i>judged </i>in this respect, that whereas they were previously involved in darkness, and did not perceive their own wretchedness and baseness, they are now brought into the light of day, and are constrained to bear witness against themselves.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p50"></A>When he says, that they are judged and convinced <i>by all, </i>you must understand him as meaning <i>all that prophesy; </i>for he had said a little before, <i>If ye all prophesy, </i>(<a name="xxi.iii-p50.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#024">1Co 14:24</a><a name="xxi.iii-p50.1"></A>.) He has expressly made use of a general term, with the view of removing the dislike that they felt for prophecy.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_852"></A><A HREF="#fn_852"><FONT SIZE="1">853</FONT></A>
 			  The unbeliever, I say, is <i>convinced</i> &#8212; <i>not </i>as if the Prophet pronounced a judgment upon him either silently in the mind, or openly with the mouth, but because the conscience of the hearer apprehends from the doctrine his own judgment. He is <i>judged, </i>inasmuch as he descends into himself, and, after thorough examination, 			 comes to know himself, while previously he was unmindful of himself. To the same purpose, too, is that saying of Christ:</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="xxi.iii-p52"></A>The Spirit, when he is come, will convince the world of sin, <br> 			 (<a name="xxi.iii-p52.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008">Joh 16:8</a><a name="xxi.iii-p52.2"></A>;)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p53"></A>and this is what he immediately adds &#8212; that <i>the secrets of his heart are made manifest</i> For he does not mean, in my opinion, that it becomes manifest to others what sort of person he is, but rather that his own conscience is aroused, so that he perceives his sins, which previously lay hid from his 			 view.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p54"></A>Here again Chrysostom asks, how it comes to pass that prophecy is so effectual for arousing <i>unbelievers, </i>while Paul had said a little before that it was not given to them. He answers, that it was not given to them as a useless sign, but for the purpose of instructing them. For my part, however, I think that it will be simpler, and therefore more suitable, to say that it was not given to unbelievers, who perish, whose hearts</p>

<p><a name="xxi.iii-p59"></A><b>25.</b> <i>Falling down on his face, he will worship</i> For it is only the knowledge of God that can bring down the pride of the flesh. To that, prophecy brings us. Hence, it is its proper effect and nature to bring down men from their 			 loftiness, that they may, with prostrate homage, render worship to God. To many, however, prophecy also is of no benefit &#8212; nay more, they are made worse by what they hear. Nor was it even Paul&#8217;s intention to ascribe this effect to prophecy, as if it were always the result of it. He simply designed to show how much advantage is derived from it, and what is its office. It is therefore a singular commendation, that it extorts from unbelievers this confession &#8212; that God is present with his people, 			 and that his majesty shines forth in the midst of their assembly.</p>  <a name="xxi.iv"></A>

<p><a name="xxi.iv-p22"></A><b>26.</b> <i>What is it then?</i> He now shows the way in which they may remedy those evils. In the first place, each gift must have its place, but in order and in measure. Farther, the Church must not be taken up to no purpose with unprofitable exercises, but must, in whatever is done, have an eye 			 to edification. He speaks, however, in the first place of edification in this way: &#8220;Let every one, according as he has been endowed with some particular gift, make it his aim to lay it out for the advantage of all.&#8221; For it is in this way that we must understand the word rendered <i>every one</i> &#8212; <i>that </i>no one may take it as implying universality, as 			 though all to a man were endowed with some such gift.</p>

<p><a name="xxi.iv-p24"></A><b>27.</b> <i>If any one speak in another tongue</i> He now describes the order and limits the measure. <i>&#8220;If </i>you have a mind to speak with other tongues,<i> let only two speak, or, at most, not more 			 than three, and let there be at the same time an interpreter sitting by</i> Without an interpreter, <i>tongues </i>are of no advantage: let them, therefore be dispensed with.&#8221; It is to be observed, however, that he does not <i>command, </i>but merely <i>permits; 			 </i>for the Church can, without any inconvenience, dispense with <i>tongues, </i>except in so far as they are helps to prophecy, as the Hebrew and Greek languages are at this day. Paul, however, makes this concession, that he may not seem to deprive the assembly of believers of any gift of the Spirit.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p25"></A>At the same time, it might seem as if even this were not agreeable to reason, inasmuch as he said before, (<a name="xxi.iv-p25.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#022">1Co 14:22</a><a name="xxi.iv-p25.1"></A>,) that <i>tongues, </i>in so far as they are for a <i>sign, </i>are suited to <i>unbelievers. </i>I answer, that, while a miracle may be performed more particularly with a view to unbelievers, it, nevertheless, does not 			 follow, that it may not be of some advantage to believers also. If you understand, that an unknown tongue is a sign to unbelievers in the sense that Isaiah&#8217;s words  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_856"></A><A HREF="#fn_856"><FONT SIZE="1">857</FONT></A>
 			 bear, the method of procedure, which Paul here prescribes, is different. For he allows of other tongues in such a way that, interpretation being joined with them, nothing is left obscure. He observes, therefore, a most admirable medium in correcting the fault of the Corinthians. On the one hand, he does not at all set aside any gift of God whatever,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_857"></A><A HREF="#fn_857"><FONT SIZE="1">858</FONT></A>
 			 in order that all his benefits may be seen among believers.

 			  and to enjoy it as his own, when there is not an opportunity for bringing it forward in a public manner.

He does not, however, restrict the number so definitely, as when he was treating of tongues, for there is less danger, in the event of their applying themselves for a longer time to prophesyings, nay more, continued application would be the most desirable thing of all; but Paul considered what the weakness of men could bear.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p35"></A>There still remains, however, a question &#8212; why it is that he assigns the like number to prophesyings and to tongues, except that, as to the latter, he adds particularly &#8212; at <i>the most, </i>for if <i>tongues</i> are less useful, there ought assuredly to be a more sparing use 			 of them? I answer, that even in <i>tongues, </i>as he takes the term, prophecy is included; for <i>tongues</i> were made use of either for discourses,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_861"></A><A HREF="#fn_861"><FONT SIZE="1">862</FONT></A>
 			 or for prayers. In the former department, the interpreter was in the place of the prophet: thus it was the principal and more frequent exercise of it. Only he limits the measure of it, lest it should fall into contempt through a feeling of disgust, and lest those who were less skillful should prevent those that were better qualified from having time and opportunity of speaking; for he would, undoubtedly, have those to whom he assigns the duty of speaking, to be of 			 the more select class, and appointed by their common suffrages.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_862"></A><A HREF="#fn_862"><FONT SIZE="1">863</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xxi.iv-p39"></A><i>Let the others judge</i>. Lest he should give any occasion to <i>the others</i> to complain &#8212; as though he were desirous that the gift of God   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_864"></A><A HREF="#fn_864"><FONT SIZE="1">865</FONT></A>
 			  should be suppressed among them and buried, he shows in what way they may lawfully make use of it for the benefit of the Church, even by keeping silence &#8212; if they set themselves to<i> judge</i> of what is said by others. For it is of no small advantage, that there should be some that are skillful in judging, who will not allow sound doctrine to be perverted by the impostures of Satan, or to be otherwise corrupted by silly 			 trifles. Paul, accordingly, teaches that the other prophets will be useful to the Church, even by keeping silence.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p41"></A>It may seem, however, to be absurd that men should have liberty given them to judge of the doctrine of God, which ought to be placed beyond all controversy. I answer, that the doctrine of God is not subjected to the scrutiny of men, but there is simply permission given them to judge by the Spirit of God, whether it is his word that is set before them, or whether human inventions are, without any authority, set off under this pretext, as we 			 shall have occasion to notice again ere long.</p>

For all have opportunity and liberty allowed them of speaking, when there is occasion for it, provided only no one unseasonably intrudes &#8212; having it in view to please himself, rather than to serve some useful purpose.

 			  For this only is the true liberty of the Spirit &#8212; not that every one be allowed to blab out rashly whatever he pleases, but that all, from the highest to the lowest, voluntarily allow themselves to be under control, and that the one Spirit be listened to, by whatever mouth he speaks.

This is applicable, it is true, to the whole of the people, but it is particularly suited to the Prophets, and Paul more especially refers to them.

Let all, therefore, undertake the office of teaching on this principle, that they do not refuse or grudge, to be scholars to each other in their turn, whenever there shall be afforded to others the means of edifying the Church.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p50"></A>He says, in the second place, <i>that all may receive consolation</i>. Hence we may infer, that the ministers of Christ, so far from envying, should rather rejoice with all their heart, that they are not the only persons that excel, but have fellow-partakers of the same gift &#8212; a disposition which Moses discovered, as is related in sacred 			 history. (<a name="xxi.iv-p50.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#028">Nu 11:28</a><a name="xxi.iv-p50.1"></A>.) For when his servant, inflamed with a foolish jealousy, was greatly displeased, because the gift of prophecy was conferred upon others also, he reproves him: &#8220;Nay,&#8221; says he, &#8220;would that all the people of God were sharers with me in this superior gift!&#8221; And, undoubtedly, it is a special consolation for pious ministers, to see the Spirit of God, whose 			 instruments they are, working in others also, and they derive also from this no small confirmation. It is a consolation, too, that it contributes to the spread of the word of God, the more it has of ministers and witnesses.</p>

<p><a name="xxi.iv-p55"></A><b>32.</b> <i>And the spirits of the Prophets</i>. This, too, is one of the reasons, why it is necessary for them to take turns &#8212; because it will sometimes happen that, in the doctrine of one Prophet, the others may find something to reprove. &#8220;It is not reasonable,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that any one should be beyond the sphere of 			 scrutiny. In this way it will sometimes come to a person&#8217;s turn to speak, who was among the audience and was sitting silent.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p56"></A>This passage has been misunderstood by some, as if Paul had said, that the Lord&#8217;s Prophets were not like persons taken with a sudden frenzy, who, when a divine impulse (<a name="xxi.iv-p56.1"></A>&#7952;&#957;&#952;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#8056;&#962;) had once seized them,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_870"></A><A HREF="#fn_870"><FONT SIZE="1">871</FONT></A>
 			  were no longer masters of themselves.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_871"></A><A HREF="#fn_871"><FONT SIZE="1">872</FONT></A>
 			  It is indeed true that God&#8217;s Prophets are not disordered in mind; but this has nothing to do with this passage of Paul&#8217;s writings. For it means, as I have already stated, that no one is exempted from the scrutiny of others, but that all must be listened to, with this understanding, that their doctrine is, nevertheless, to be subjected to examination. It is not, however, without difficulty, for the Apostle declares that their <i>spirits are subject</i>. Though it is of gifts that he speaks, how can prophecy, which is given by the Holy Spirit, be judged of by men, so that the Spirit himself is not judged by them? In this manner, even the word of God, which is revealed by the Spirit; will be subjected to examination. The unseemliness of this needs not be pointed out, for it is of itself abundantly evident. I maintain, however, that neither the Spirit of God nor his word is 			 restrained by a scrutiny of this kind. The Holy Spirit, I say, retains his majesty unimpaired, so as to</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="xxi.iv-p62"></A>judge all things, while he is judged by no one. <br> 			 (<a name="xxi.iv-p62.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#015">1Co 2:15</a><a name="xxi.iv-p62.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p63"></A>The sacred word of God, too, retains the respect due to it, so that it is received without any disputation, as soon as it is presented.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p64"></A>&#8220;What is it, then,&#8221; you will say, &#8220;that is subjected to examination?&#8221;&#8217; I answer &#8212; If any one were furnished with a full revelation, that man would undoubtedly, along with his gift, be above all scrutiny. There is, I say, no subjection, where there is a plenitude of revelation; but as God has distributed his spirit to every one in a certain measure, in such a way that, even amidst the greatest abundance, there is always something 			 wanting, it is not to be wondered, if no one is elevated to such a height, as to look down from aloft upon all others, and have no one to pass judgment upon him. We may now see how it is, that, without any dishonor to the Holy Spirit, his gifts admit of being examined. Nay more, where, after full examination, nothing is found that is worthy of reproof, there will still be something, that stands in need of polishing. The sum of all, therefore, is this &#8212; that the gift is subjected to examination 			 in such a way, that whatever is set forth, the Prophets consider as to it &#8212; whether it has proceeded from the Spirit of God; for if it shall appear that the Spirit is the author of it, there is no room left for hesitation.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p65"></A>It is, however still farther asked &#8212; &#8220;What rule is to be made use of in examining?&#8221; This question is answered in part by the mouth of Paul, who, in <a name="xxi.iv-p65.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006">Ro 12:6</a><a name="xxi.iv-p65.1"></A>, requires that prophecy be regulated according to the <i>proportion of faith. </i>As to the passing of judgment, however, there is no doubt, that it ought to be regulated by the word and Spirit of God &#8212; 			 that nothing may be approved of, but what is discovered to be from God &#8212; that nothing may be found fault with but in accordance with his word &#8212; in fine, that God alone may preside in this judgment, and that men may be merely his heralds.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p66"></A>From this passage of Paul&#8217;s writings, we may conjecture how very illustrious that Church was, in respect of an extraordinary abundance and variety of spiritual gifts. There were colleges of Prophets, so that pains had to be taken, that they might have their respective turns. There was so great a diversity of gifts, that there was a superabundance. We now see our leanness, nay, our poverty; but in this we have a just punishment, sent to 			 requite our ingratitude. For neither are the riches of God exhausted, nor is his benignity lessened; but we are neither deserving of his bounty, nor capable of receiving his liberality. Still we have an ample sufficiency of light and doctrine, provided there were no deficiency in respect of the cultivation of piety, and the fruits that spring from it.</p>

For if we are called to contend against wicked doctrines, even though heaven and earth should come together, we must, nevertheless, persevere in the contest. We must, indeed, in the first place, make it our aim, that the truth of God may, without contention, maintain its ground; but if the wicked resist, we must set our face against them, and have no 			 fear, lest the blame of the disturbances should be laid to our charge.

<p><a name="xxi.v-p18"></A>It appears that the Church of the Corinthians was infected with this fault too, that the talkativeness of women was allowed a place in the sacred assembly, or rather that the fullest liberty was given to it. Hence he forbids them to speak in public, either for the purpose of teaching or of prophesying. This, however, we must understand as referring to ordinary service, or where there is a Church in a regularly 			 constituted state; for a necessity may occur of such a nature as to require that a woman should speak in public; but Paul has merely in view what is becoming in a duly regulated assembly.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.v-p19"></A><b>34.</b> <i>Let them be in subjection, as also saith the law.</i> What connection has the object that he has in view with the subjection under which the law places women? &#8220;For what is there,&#8221; some one will say, &#8220;to hinder their being in subjection, 			 and yet at the same time teaching?&#8221; I answer, that the office of teaching   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_876"></A><A HREF="#fn_876"><FONT SIZE="1">877</FONT></A>
 			  is a superiority in the Church, and is, consequently, inconsistent with <i>subjection. </i>For how unseemly a thing it were, that one who is under subjection to one of the members, should preside   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_877"></A><A HREF="#fn_877"><FONT SIZE="1">878</FONT></A>
 			  over the entire body! It is therefore an argument from things inconsistent &#8212; If the woman is under subjection, she is, consequently, prohibited from authority to teach in public.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_878"></A><A HREF="#fn_878"><FONT SIZE="1">879</FONT></A>
 			  And unquestionably,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_879"></A><A HREF="#fn_879"><FONT SIZE="1">880</FONT></A>
 			  wherever even natural propriety has been maintained, women have in all ages been excluded from the public management of affairs.

 			  the effrontery of Caia Afrania   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_881"></A><A HREF="#fn_881"><FONT SIZE="1">882</FONT></A>
 			  led to their being interdicted, even from this. Paul&#8217;s reasoning, however, is simple &#8212; that authority to teach is not suitable to the station that a woman occupies, because, if she teaches, she presides over all the men, while it becomes her to be <i>under subjection.</i></p>

When he says, <i>husbands, </i>he does not prohibit them from consulting the Prophets themselves, if necessary. For all husbands are not competent to give an answer in such a case; but, as he is reasoning here as to external polity, he reckons it sufficient to point out what is unseemly, that the Corinthians may guard against it. In the meantime, it is the part of the prudent reader to consider, that the things of which 			 he here treats are intermediate and indifferent, in which there is nothing unlawful, but what is at variance with propriety and edification.</p>

<p><a name="xxi.v-p29"></A><b>36</b> <i> Did the word of God come out from you?</i> This is a somewhat sharper reproof, but nothing more than was needful for beating down the haughtiness of the Corinthians. They were, beyond measure, self-complacent. They could not endure that either themselves, or what belonged to them, should 			 be found fault with in anything. He asks, accordingly, whether they are the only Christians in the world; nay, farther, whether they are the first, or are to be the last? <i>&#8220;Did the word of God,&#8221;</i> says he, <i>&#8220;come out from you?&#8221; </i>that is, <i>&#8220;Did </i>it originate with you<i>?&#8221; &#8220;Has </i>it ended with you?&#8221; that is, <i>&#8220;Will </i>it spread no farther<i>?&#8221; </i>The design of the admonition is this &#8212; that they may not, without having any regard to others, please themselves in their own contrivances or customs. And this is a doctrine of general 			 application; for no Church should be taken up with itself exclusively, to the neglect of others; but on the contrary, they ought all, in their turn, to hold out the right hand to each other, in the way of cherishing mutual fellowship, and accommodating themselves to each other, in so far as a regard to harmony requires.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_882"></A><A HREF="#fn_882"><FONT SIZE="1">883</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.v-p31"></A>But here it is asked, whether every Church, according as it has had the precedence of another in the order of time,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_883"></A><A HREF="#fn_883"><FONT SIZE="1">884</FONT></A>
 			  has it also in its power to bind it to observe its institutions.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_884"></A><A HREF="#fn_884"><FONT SIZE="1">885</FONT></A>
 			  For Paul seems to intimate this in what he says. For example, Jerusalem was the mother of all the Churches, inasmuch as <i>the word of the Lord had come out from it</i> Was she then at liberty to assume to herself a superior right, so as to bind all others to follow her? I answer, that Paul here does not employ an argument of universal application, but one 			 that was specially applicable to the Corinthians, as is frequently the case. He had, therefore, an eye to individuals, rather than to the thing itself. Hence it does not necessarily follow, that Churches that are of later origin must be bound to observe, in every point, the institutions of the earlier ones, inasmuch as even Paul himself did not bind himself by this rule, so as to obtrude upon other Churches the customs that were in use at Jerusalem. Let there be nothing of ambition &#8212; let there 			 be nothing of obstinacy &#8212; let there be nothing of pride and contempt for other Churches &#8212; let there be, on the other hand, a desire to edify &#8212; let there be moderation and prudence; and in that case, amidst a diversity of observances, there will be nothing that is worthy of reproof.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.v-p34"></A>Let us, therefore, bear in mind, that the haughtiness of the Corinthians is here reproved, who, concerned for themselves exclusively,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_885"></A><A HREF="#fn_885"><FONT SIZE="1">886</FONT></A>
 			 showed no respect to the Churches of earlier origin, from which they had received the gospel, and did not endeavor to accommodate themselves to other Churches, to which the gospel had flowed out from them. Would to God that there were no Corinth in our times, in respect of this fault, as well as of others! But we see how savage men, who have <i>never tasted </i>the gospel, (<a name="xxi.v-p35.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#005">Heb 6:5</a><a name="xxi.v-p35.2"></A>,) trouble the 			 Churches of the saints by a tyrannical enforcement of their own laws.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_886"></A><A HREF="#fn_886"><FONT SIZE="1">887</FONT></A>

He does not, however, desire them to inquire as to his doctrine, as though it were a doubtful matter, but to receive 			 it as the sure word of God, inasmuch as they will recognize it as the word of God, if they judge rightly. Farther, it is in virtue of apostolical authority, that he takes it upon himself to prescribe to them the sentence which they ought to pronounce.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_887"></A><A HREF="#fn_887"><FONT SIZE="1">888</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.v-p40"></A>There is still greater confidence in what he immediately adds &#8212; He <i>that is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</i> This, it is true, was allowable for Paul, who was fully assured as to the revelation that he had received from God, and he ought also to have been well known to the Corinthians, so that they should have 			 looked upon him in no other light, than as an Apostle of the Lord. It is not, however, for every one to advance such a claim for himself, or if he does, he will, by his boasting, throw himself open to merited derision, for <i>then </i>only is there ground for such confidence, when what is affirmed with the mouth shows itself in reality. It was with truth that Paul affirmed, that his precepts were those of the Lord. Many will be prepared to pretend the 			 same thing on false grounds. His great object is this &#8212; that it may be clearly perceived, that he who does not allow himself to be under control, speaks as from the Holy Spirit, not from his own brain. That man, therefore, who is no other than a pure organ of the Holy Spirit, will have the courage to declare fearlessly with Paul, that those who shall reject his doctrine, are not <i>Prophets </i>or <i>spiritual </i>persons; and this he will do in virtue of a right that belongs to him, in accordance with what we had in the beginning of the Epistle &#8212; he <i>that is spiritual, judgeth all things. </i>(<a name="xxi.v-p40.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#015">1Co 2:15</a><a name="xxi.v-p40.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.v-p41"></A>But it may be asked here, how it is that Paul declares those things to be <i>commandments of the Lord, </i>as to which no statement is to be found in the Scriptures? Besides this, there is also another difficulty that presents itself &#8212; that if they are the <i>commandments of the Lord, </i>they are necessary to be observed, and they bind the conscience, and yet they are rites connected with polity, as to the observance of which no such necessity exists. Paul, however, merely says, that he enjoins nothing, but what is in accordance with the will of God. Now God endowed him with wisdom, that he might recommend this order in external things at Corinth, and in other places &#8212; not that 			 it might be an inviolable law, like those that relate to the spiritual worship of God, but that it might be a useful directory to all the sons of God, and not by any means to be despised.</p>

 			  but this is a mistake. For Paul had it in view to cut off every handle from contentious persons, who make no end of disputing, and that, under the pretense of inquiring &#8212; as if the matter were not yet clear; or at least he intimates in general terms, that he regarded as of no account any one that would call in question what he said. &#8220;If any one is ignorant, I do not stop to take notice of his 			 doubts, for the certainty of my doctrine is not at all impaired thereby. Let him go then, whoever he may be. As for you, do not the less on that account give credit to Christ, as speaking by me.&#8221; In fine, he intimates, that sceptics, contentious persons, and subtle disputants;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_889"></A><A HREF="#fn_889"><FONT SIZE="1">890</FONT></A>
 			  do not by the questions they raise diminish, in any degree, the authority of sound doctrine, and of that truth as to which believers ought to feel assured, and at the same time he admonishes us, not to allow their doubts to be any hindrance in our way. That elevation of mind, however, which despises all human judgments, ought to be founded on ascertained truth. Hence, as it would be the part of perverse rashness, either to maintain pertinaciously, in opposition to 			 the views of all others, an opinion that has once been taken up, or audaciously to cling to it, while others are in doubt, so, on the other hand, when we have felt assured that it is God that speaks, let us fearlessly break through all human impediments and all difficulties.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_890"></A><A HREF="#fn_890"><FONT SIZE="1">891</FONT></A>

As he had discoursed, in various instances, as to rites, he wished to sum up everything here in a brief summary &#8212; that decorum should be observed &#8212; that confusion should be avoided. This statement shows, that he did not wish to bind consciences by the foregoing precepts, as if they were in themselves necessary, but only in so far as they were subservient to propriety and peace. Hence we gather (as I have said) a 			 doctrine that is always in force, as to the purpose to which the polity of the Church ought to be directed. The Lord has left external rites in our choice with this view &#8212; that we may not think that his worship consists wholly in these things.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.v-p53"></A>In the meantime, he has not allowed us a rambling and unbridled liberty, but has inclosed it (so to speak) with railings,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_893"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">894</FONT></A>
 			 or at least has laid a restriction upon the liberty granted by him in such a manner, that it is after all only from his word that we can judge as to what is right. This passage, therefore, when duly considered, will show the difference between the tyrannical edicts of the Pope, which oppress men&#8217;s consciences with a dreadful bondage, and the godly regulations of the Church, by which discipline and order are maintained. Nay farther, we may readily infer from this, that the latter are 			 not to be looked upon as human traditions, inasmuch as they are founded upon this general injunction, and have a manifest approval, as it were, from the mouth of Christ himself.</p>

The meaning is &#8212; every language is intelligible to some nation or other; and it is only to persons who are ignorant of it, that its words are destitute of signification. This the Apostle illustrates in a very forcible manner: &#8216;Therefore, if I know not the, meaning of the voice, (<a name="xxi.ii-p35.3"></A>&#964;&#8034;&#962; &#966;&#969;&#957;&#8034;&#962;,<i> of the language</i>,) I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.&#8217; We shall be like two foreigners, who do not understand each other&#8217;s tongue. The very use of the term <i>interpret </i>and <i>interpretation</i>, as applied to this subject, also proves that he could 				  only have intelligent language in view: it being a contradiction in terms to speak of interpreting that which has no meaning.&#8221; Henderson on Inspiration. &#8212; <i>Ed</i></p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xxi.ii-p39"></A> &#8220;The Greeks, after the custom of the Egyptians, mentioned by; Herodotus, (lib. 2,) called all those <i>barbarians </i>who did not speak their language.

Afterwards, <i>barbarian </i>signified any one 				  who spoke a language which another did not understand. Thus the Scythian philosopher, Anacharsis, said, that among the Athenians the Scythians were <i>barbarians</i>; and among the Scythians the Athenians were <i>barbarians</i>. In like manner Ovid.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xxi.ii-p51"></A> &#8220;What is it,&#8221; says <i>Witsius</i>, (in his &#8220;Sacred Dissertations,&#8221;) &#8220;to pray with the <i>tongue</i>? with the <i>spirit</i>? with the <i>mind</i>? (<a name="xxi.ii-p51.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014">1 Cor. 14:14</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015">15</a><a name="xxi.ii-p51.1"></A>.) The <i>tongue </i>means here a language unknown to others, and employed by one who is endowed with a supernatural gift of the Holy Spirit. To <i>pray with the tongue</i>,<i> 				  </i>is to pray in a language unknown to others; as, for instance, to pray in the Hebrew language in presence of Greeks. In that sense he had said, (<a name="xxi.ii-p51.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002">1Co 14:2</a><a name="xxi.ii-p51.2"></A>,) &#8216;He that speaketh with the tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto God; for no man understandeth him;&#8217; that is, he who speaks in a foreign tongue, the knowledge of which he has acquired by an 				  extraordinary gift of the Spirit, has God only for a witness. He cannot reckon as his witnesses, or as persons aware of what he is doing, those who are ignorant of the language, and to whose edification he has contributed little or nothing. The <i>spirit </i>means here that extraordinary gift, by which a man is led to act in a certain way, accompanied by almost ecstatic emotions, so that sometimes he is neither aware what he says, nor do others 				  understand what he means. To <i>pray with the Spirit</i>, is to pray in such a manner as to show that you feel the presence of an extraordinary gift of the Spirit, which moves and hurries you along, in a powerful manner, to those actions which excite astonishment. <a name="xxi.ii-p51.3"></A>&#925;&#959;&#965;&#962;,<i> 				  intelligence</i>,<i> mind</i>, seems here to be chiefly used in a transitive sense, to mean what we give another to understand. Such is the meaning of, <a name="xxi.ii-p51.4"></A>&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, to which <a name="xxi.ii-p51.5"></A>&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962; 				  corresponds. <a name="xxi.ii-p51.6"></A>&#1495;&#1496; &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1498; &#1500;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;,<i> incline thine ear to my understanding</i>, that is, to those things which I shall give thee to understand. (<a name="xxi.ii-p51.7"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#001">Pr 5:1</a><a name="xxi.ii-p51.7"></A>.) To <i>pray 				  with the mind</i>, is to pray in such a manner that the prayers which you deliberately <i>conceive</i>, may be conceived and understood by others. Paul, accordingly, proposes himself as an example of the proper manner of conducting prayers. <i>If I pray in a tongue </i>unknown to the 				  assembly in whose presence I pray, but which I have learned by Divine inspiration, <i>my spirit prayeth</i>, I am acting under the influence of that gift, which impels and arouses me to unusual and remarkable proceedings; but <i>my understanding is unfruitful</i>, I do not enable another to understand with 				  advantage the conceptions of my mind. <i>What then</i>?<i> I will pray with the Spirit</i>; when the vehement emotion of the Spirit comes upon me, I will not struggle against it, <i>but I will pray with the understanding also</i>; I will show that I am not mad, but 				  possessed of a sound understanding; and I will endeavor that others, as well as myself, be edified by my prayer.&#8221; Biblical Cabinet, volume 24. &#8212; <i>Ed</i></p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xxi.iii-p31"></A> <i>Henderson </i>on <i>Isaiah</i>, when commenting on the passage here quoted by the Apostle, (<a name="xxi.iii-p31.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009">Isa 28:9-11</a><a name="xxi.iii-p31.1"></A>,) observes, that it &#8220;contains the taunting language of the drunken 				  priests and judges of the Jews, who repel with scorn the idea that they should require the plain and reiterated lessons which Jehovah taught by his messengers. Such elementary instruction was fit&#8221; (in their view) &#8220;only for babes: it was an insult to their understanding to suppose that they stood in need of it. The language of verse 10&#8221; (<a name="xxi.iii-p31.2"></A><i>precept pon</i>,<i> precept</i>, etc.) &#8220;more resembles that of inebriated persons, than any used by persons in a state of sobriety. The words are obviously selected to suit the character of those supposed to employ them; and, by their monosyllabic and repetitious forms, admirably express the initiatory process of tuition which they indignantly 				  despise. 13-24 The language they employed in caviling at the Prophetic warnings was all but barbarous: it consisted of barely intelligible sounds: they should, by way of condign punishment, hear the foreign, and to them apparently mocking accents of the Chaldeans, whom God would employ as the interpreters of his severe but righteous will. The passage is employed by Paul (<a name="xxi.iii-p31.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020">1 Cor. 14:20</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#021">21</a><a name="xxi.iii-p31.3"></A>) quite in the spirit of the connection in which it here stands.
