<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>On the Christian Life</I>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p> <a name="ii"></A> <h1 align="center"><a name="ii-p0.1"></A>ON THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h1> <h2 align="center"><a name="ii-p0.2"></A>CHAPTER I.</h2> <h4 align="center"><a name="ii-p0.3"></A>THE LIFE OF A CHRISTIAN MAN. SCRIPTURAL ARGUMENTS EXHORTING TO IT.</h4>  <li>Connection between this chapter and the doctrine of Regeneration. Necessity of  the doctrine concerning the Christian Life. The brevity of this treatise. The  method of it. Plainness and unadorned simplicity of the Scripture system of  morals. <li>Two divisions. First, Personal holiness. 1. Because God is holy. 2. Because of  our communion with his saints. <li>Second division, relating to our Redemption. Admirable moral system of  Scripture. Five special inducements or exhortations to a Christian Life. <li>False Christians who are opposed to this life censured 1. They have not truly  learned Christ. 2. The Gospel not the guide of their words or actions. 3. They  do not imitate Christ the Master. 4. They would separate the Spirit from his  word. <li>Christians ought not to despond: Provided 1. They take the word of God for their  guide. 2. Sincerely cultivate righteousness. 3. Walk, according to their  capacity, in the ways of the Lord. 4. Make some progress. 5. Persevere.  <h2 align="center"><a name="ii-p0.10"></A>CHAPTER II.</h2> <h4 align="center"><a name="ii-p0.11"></A>II. A SUMMARY OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE. OF SELF-DENIAL.</h4> <li>Consideration of the second general division in regard to the Christian life.  Its beginning and sum. A twofold respect. 1. We are not our own. Respect to both  the fruit and the use. Unknown to philosophers, who have placed reason on the  throne of the Holy Spirit. <li>Since we are not our own, we must seek the glory of God, and obey his will.  Self-denial recommended to the disciples of Christ. He who neglects it, deceived  either by pride or hypocrisy, rushes on destruction. <li>Three things to be followed, and two to be shunned in life. Impiety and worldly  lusts to be shunned. Sobriety, justice, and piety, to be followed. An inducement  to right conduct. <li>Self-denial the sum of Paul's doctrine. Its difficulty. Qualities in us which  make it difficult. Cures for these qualities. 1. Ambition to be suppressed. 2.  Humility to be embraced. 3. Candour to be esteemed. 4. Mutual charity to be  preserved. 5. Modesty to be sincerely cultivated. <li>The advantage of our neighbour to be promoted. Here self-denial most necessary,  and yet most difficult. Here a double remedy. 1. The benefits bestowed upon us  are for the common benefit of the Church. 2. We ought to do all we can for our  neighbour. This illustrated by analogy from the members of the human body. This  duty of charity founded on the divine command. <li>Charity ought to have for its attendants patience and kindness. We should  consider the image of God in our neighbours, and especially in those who are of  the household of faith. Hence a fourfold consideration which refutes all  objections. A common objection refuted. <li>Christian life cannot exist without charity. Remedies for the vices opposed to  charity. 1. Mercy. 2. Humility. 3. Modesty. 4. Diligence. 5. Perseverance. <li>Self-denial, in respect of God, should lead to equanimity and tolerance. 1. We  are always subject to God. 2. We should shun avarice and ambition. 3. We should  expect all prosperity from the blessing of God, and entirely depend on him. <li>We ought not to desire wealth or honours without the divine blessing, nor follow  the arts of the wicked. We ought to cast all our care upon God, and never envy  the prosperity of others. <li>We ought to commit ourselves entirely to God. The necessity of this doctrine.  Various uses of affliction. Heathen abuse and corruption.   <h2 align="center"><a name="ii-p0.23"></A>CHAPTER III.</h2> <h4 align="center"><a name="ii-p0.24"></A>OF BEARING THE CROSS&#8212;ONE BRANCH OF SELF-DENIAL.</h4> <li>What the cross is. By whom, and on whom, and for what cause imposed. Its  necessity and dignity. <li>The cross necessary. 1. To humble our pride. 2. To make us apply to God for aid.  Example of David. 3. To give us experience of God's presence. <li>Manifold uses of the cross. 1. Produces patience, hope, and firm confidence in  God, gives us victory and perseverance. Faith invincible. <li>2. Frames us to obedience. Example of Abraham. This training how useful. <li>The cross necessary to subdue the wantonness of the flesh. This portrayed by an  apposite simile. Various forms of the cross. <li>3. God permits our infirmities, and corrects past faults, that he may keep us in  obedience. This confirmed by a passage from Solomon and an Apostle. <li>Singular consolation under the cross, when we suffer persecution for  righteousness. Some parts of this consolation. <li>This form of the cross most appropriate to believers, and should be borne  willingly and cheerfully. This cheerfulness is not unfeeling hilarity, but,  while groaning under the burden, waits patiently for the Lord. <li>A description of this conflict. Opposed to the vanity of the Stoics. Illustrated  by the authority and example of Christ. <li>Proved by the testimony and uniform experience of the elect. Also by the special  example of the Apostle Peter. The nature of the patience required of us. <li>Distinction between the patience of Christians and philosophers. The latter  pretend a necessity which cannot be resisted. The former hold forth the justice  of God and his care of our safety. A full exposition of this difference.  <h2 align="center"><a name="ii-p0.37"></A>CHAPTER IV.</h2> <h4 align="center"><a name="ii-p0.38"></A>OF MEDITATING ON THE FUTURE LIFE.</h4> <li>The design of God in afflicting his people. 1. To accustom us to despise the  present life. Our infatuated love of it. Afflictions employed as the cure. 2. To  lead us to aspire to heaven. <li>Excessive love of the present life prevents us from duly aspiring to the other.  Hence the disadvantages of prosperity. Blindness of the human judgment. Our  philosophizing on the vanity of life only of momentary influence. The necessity  of the cross. <li>The present life an evidence of the divine favour to his people; and therefore,  not to be detested. On the contrary, should call forth thanksgiving. The crown  of victory in heaven after the contest on earth. <li>Weariness of the present life how to be tempered. The believer's estimate of  life. Comparison of the present and the future life. How far the present life  should be hated. <li>Christians should not tremble at the fear of death. Two reasons. Objection.  Answer. Other reasons. <li>Reasons continued. Conclusion.   <h2 align="center"><a name="ii-p0.46"></A>CHAPTER V.</h2> <h4 align="center"><a name="ii-p0.47"></A>HOW TO USE THE PRESENT LIFE, AND THE COMFORTS OF IT.</h4> <li>Necessity of this doctrine. Use of the goods of the present life. Extremes to be  avoided. 1. Excessive austerity. 2. Carnal intemperance and lasciviousness. <li>God, by creating so many mercies, consulted not only for our necessities, but  also for our comfort and delight. Confirmation from a passage in the Psalms, and  from experience. <li>Excessive austerity, therefore, to be avoided. So also must the wantonness of  the flesh. 1. The creatures invite us to know, love, and honour the Creator. 2.  This not done by the wicked, who only abuse these temporal mercies. <li>All earthly blessings to be despised in comparison of the heavenly life.  Aspiration after this life destroyed by an excessive love of created objects.  First, Intemperance. <li>Second, Impatience and immoderate desire. Remedy of these evils. The creatures  assigned to our use. Man still accountable for the use he makes of them. <li>God requires us in all our actions to look to his calling. Use of this doctrine.  It is full of comfort.
