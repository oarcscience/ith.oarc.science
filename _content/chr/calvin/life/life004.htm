<p class="SectionInfo1"><a name="v-p1"></A>The four divisions of this chapter are,&#8212;I. The nature of the  cross, its necessity and dignity, sec. 1, 2. II. The manifold advantages of  the cross described, sec. 3&#8211;6. III. The form of the cross the most excellent  of all, and yet it by no means removes all sense of pain, sec. 7, 8. IV. A  description of warfare under the cross, and of true patience, (not that of  philosophers,) after the example of Christ, sec. 9&#8211;11.</p> 
<p class="normal"><a name="v-p2"></A>1. THE pious mind must ascend still higher, namely, whither  Christ calls his disciples when he says, that every one of them must &#8220;take up  his cross,&#8221; (<a name="v-p2.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#024">Matth. xvi. 24</a><a name="v-p2.1"></A>.) Those whom the Lord has chosen and honoured with  his intercourse must prepare for a hard, laborious, troubled life, a life full  of many and various kinds of evils; it being the will of our heavenly Father to  exercise his people in this way while putting them to the proof. Having begun  this course with Christ the first-born, he continues it towards all his  children. For though that Son was dear to him above others, the Son in whom he  was &#8220;well pleased,&#8221; yet we see, that far from being treated gently and  indulgently, we may say, that not only was he subjected to a perpetual cross  while he dwelt on earth, but his whole life was nothing else than a kind of  perpetual cross. The Apostle assigns the reason, &#8220;Though he was a Son, yet  learned he obedience by the things which he suffered,&#8221; (<a name="v-p2.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008">Heb. v. 8</a><a name="v-p2.2"></A>.) Why then  should we exempt ourselves from that condition to which Christ our Head behoved  to submit; especially since he submitted on our account, that he might in his  own person exhibit a model of patience? Wherefore, the Apostle declares, that  all the children of God are destined to be conformed to him. Hence it affords us  great consolation in hard and difficult circumstances, which men deem evil and  adverse, to think that we are holding fellowship with the sufferings of Christ;  that as he passed to celestial glory through a labyrinth of many woes, so we too  are conducted thither through various tribulations. For, in another passage,  Paul himself thus speaks, &#8220;we must through much tribulation enter the kingdom of  God,&#8221; (<a name="v-p2.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022">Acts xiv. 22</a><a name="v-p2.3"></A>;) and again, &#8220;that I may know him, and the power of his  resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto  his death,&#8221; (<a name="v-p2.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029">Rom viii. 29</a><a name="v-p2.4"></A>.) How powerfully should it soften the bitterness of  the cross, to think that the more we are afflicted with adversity, the surer we  are made of our fellowship with Christ; by communion with whom our sufferings  are not only blessed to us, but tend greatly to the furtherance of our  salvation.</p> 
<p class="normal"><a name="v-p3"></A>2. We may add, that the only thing which made it necessary  for our Lord to undertake to bear the cross, was to testify and prove his  obedience to the Father; whereas there are many reasons which make it necessary  for us to live constantly under the cross. Feeble as we are by nature, and prone  to ascribe all perfection to our flesh, unless we receive as it were ocular  demonstration of our weakness, we readily estimate our virtue above its proper  worth, and doubt not that, whatever happens, it will stand unimpaired and  invincible against all difficulties. Hence we indulge a stupid and empty  confidence in the flesh, and then trusting to it wax proud against the Lord  himself; as if our own faculties were sufficient without his grace. This  arrogance cannot be better repressed than when He proves to us by experience,  not only how great our weakness, but also our frailty is. Therefore, he visits  us with disgrace, or poverty, or bereavement, or disease, or other afflictions.  Feeling altogether unable to support them, we forthwith, in so far as regards  ourselves, give way, and thus humbled learn to invoke his strength, which alone  can enable us to bear up under a weight of affliction. Nay, even the holiest of  men, however well aware that they stand not in their own strength, but by the  grace of God, would feel too secure in their own fortitude and constancy, were  they not brought to a more thorough knowledge of themselves by the trial of the  cross. This feeling gained even upon David, &#8220;In my prosperity I Said, I shall  never be moved. Lord, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong:  thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled,&#8221; (<a name="v-p3.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006">Ps. 30:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#007">7</a><a name="v-p3.1"></A>.) He confesses  that in prosperity his feelings were dulled and blunted, so that, neglecting the  grace of God, on which alone he ought to have depended, he leant to himself, and  promised himself perpetuity. If it so happened to this great prophet, who of us  should not fear and study caution? Though in tranquillity they flatter  themselves with the idea of greater constancy and patience, yet, humbled by  adversity, they learn the deception. Believers, I say, warned by such proofs of  their diseases, make progress in humility, and, divesting themselves of a  depraved confidence in the flesh, betake themselves to the grace of God, and,  when they have so betaken themselves, experience the presence of the divine  power, in which is ample protection.</p> 
<p class="normal"><a name="v-p4"></A>3. This Paul teaches when he says that tribulation worketh  patience, and patience experience. God having promised that he will be with  believers in tribulation, they feel the truth of the promise; while supported by  his hand, they endure patiently. This they could never do by their own strength.  Patience, therefore, gives the saints an experimental proof that God in reality  furnishes the aid which he has promised whenever there is need. Hence also their  faith is confirmed, for it were very ungrateful not to expect that in future the  truth of God will be, as they have already found it, firm and constant. We now  see how many advantages are at once produced by the cross. Overturning the  overweening opinion we form of our own virtue, and detecting the hypocrisy in  which we delight, it removes our pernicious carnal confidence, teaching us, when  thus humbled, to recline on God alone, so that we neither are oppressed nor  despond. Then victory is followed by hope, inasmuch as the Lord, by performing  what he has promised, establishes his truth in regard to the future. Were these  the only reasons, it is surely plain how necessary it is for us to bear the  cross. It is of no little importance to be rid of your self-love, and made fully  conscious of your weakness; so impressed with a sense of your weakness as to  learn to distrust yourself&#8212;to distrust yourself so as to transfer your  confidence to God, reclining on him with such heartfelt confidence as to trust  in his aid, and continue invincible to the end, standing by his grace so as to  perceive that he is true to his promises, and so assured of the certainty of his  promises as to be strong in hope.</p> 
<p class="normal"><a name="v-p5"></A>4. Another end which the Lord has in afflicting his people  is to try their patience, and train them to obedience&#8212;not that they can yield  obedience to him except in so far as he enables them; but he is pleased thus to  attest and display striking proofs of the graces which he has conferred upon his  saints, lest they should remain within unseen and unemployed. Accordingly, by  bringing forward openly the strength and constancy of endurance with which he  has provided his servants, he is said to try their patience. Hence the  expressions that God tempted Abraham, (<a name="v-p5.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001">Gen. 21:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012">12</a><a name="v-p5.1"></A>,) and made proof of his  piety by not declining to sacrifice his only son. Hence, too, Peter tells us  that our faith is proved by tribulation, just as gold is tried in a furnace of  fire. But who will say it is not expedient that the most excellent gift of  patience which the believer has received from his God should be applied to uses  by being made sure and manifest? Otherwise men would never value it according to  its worth. But if God himself, to prevent the virtues which he has conferred  upon believers from lurking in obscurity, nay, lying useless and perishing, does  aright in supplying materials for calling them forth, there is the best reason  for the afflictions of the saints, since without them their patience could not  exist. I say, that by the cross they are also trained to obedience, because they  are thus taught to live not according to their own wish, but at the disposal of  God. Indeed, did all things proceed as they wish, they would not know what it is  to follow God. Seneca mentions (De Vit. Beata, cap. xv.) that there was an old  proverb when any one was exhorted to endure adversity, &#8220;Follow God;#8221; thereby  intimating, that men truly submitted to the yoke of God only when they gave  their back and hand to his rod. But if it is most right that we should in all  things prove our obedience to our heavenly Father, certainly we ought not to  decline any method by which he trains us to obedience.</p> 
<p class="normal"><a name="v-p6"></A>5. Still, however, we see not how necessary that obedience  is, unless we at the same time consider how prone our carnal nature is to shake  off the yoke of God whenever it has been treated with some degree of gentleness  and indulgence. It just happens to it as with refractory horses, which, if kept  idle for a few days at hack and manger, become ungovernable, and no longer  recognize the rider, whose command before they implicitly obeyed. And we  invariably become what God complains of in the people of Israel&#8212;waxing gross  and fat, we kick against him who reared and nursed us, (<a name="v-p6.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015">Deut. xxxii. 15</a><a name="v-p6.1"></A>.) The  kindness of God should allure us to ponder and love his goodness; but since such  is our malignity, that we are invariably corrupted by his indulgence, it is more  than necessary for us to be restrained by discipline from breaking forth into  such petulance. Thus, lest we become emboldened by an over-abundance of wealth;  lest elated with honour, we grow proud; lest inflated with other advantages of  body, or mind, or fortune, we grow insolent, the Lord himself interferes as he  sees to be expedient by means of the cross, subduing and curbing the arrogance  of our flesh, and that in various ways, as the advantage of each requires. For  as we do not all equally labour under the same disease, so we do not all need  the same difficult cure. Hence we see that all are not exercised with the same  kind of cross. While the heavenly Physician treats some more gently, in the case  of others he employs harsher remedies, his purpose being to provide a cure for  all. Still none is left free and untouched, because he knows that all, without a  single exception, are diseased.</p> 
<p class="normal"><a name="v-p7"></A>6. We may add, that our most merciful Father requires not  only to prevent our weakness, but often to correct our past faults, that he may  keep us in due obedience. Therefore, whenever we are afflicted we ought  immediately to call to mind our past life. In this way we will find that the  faults which we have committed are deserving of such castigation. And yet the  exhortation to patience is not to be founded chiefly on the acknowledgment of  sin. For Scripture supplies a far better consideration when it says, that in  adversity &#8220;we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with  the world,&#8221; (<a name="v-p7.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#032">1 Cor. xi. 32</a><a name="v-p7.1"></A>.) Therefore, in the very bitterness of tribulation we  ought to recognise the kindness and mercy of our Father, since even then he  ceases not to further our salvation. For he afflicts, not that he may ruin or  destroy but rather that he may deliver us from the condemnation of the world.  Let this thought lead us to what Scripture elsewhere teaches: &#8220;My son, despise  not the chastening of the Lord; neither be weary of his correction: For whom the  Lord loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth,&#8221;  (<a name="v-p7.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011">Prov. 3:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012">12</a><a name="v-p7.2"></A>.) When we perceive our Father&#8217;s rod, is it not our part to  behave as obedient docile sons rather than rebelliously imitate desperate men,  who are hardened in wickedness? God dooms us to destruction, if he does not, by  correction, call us back when we have fallen off from him, so that it is truly  said, &#8220;If ye be without chastisement,&#8221; &#8220;then are ye bastards, and not sons,&#8221;  (<a name="v-p7.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#008">Heb. xii. 8</a><a name="v-p7.3"></A>.) We are most perverse then if we cannot bear him while he is  manifesting his good-will to us, and the care which he takes of our salvation.  Scripture states the difference between believers and unbelievers to be, that  the latter, as the slaves of inveterate and deep-seated iniquity, only become  worse and more obstinate under the lash; whereas the former, like free-born sons  turn to repentance. Now, therefore, choose your class. But as I have already  spoken of this subject, it is sufficient to have here briefly adverted to it.</p> 
<p class="normal"><a name="v-p8"></A>7. There is singular consolation, moreover, when we are  persecuted for righteousness&#8217; sake. For our thought should then be, How high the  honour which God bestows upon us in distinguishing us by the special badge of  his soldiers. By suffering persecution for righteousness&#8217; sake, I mean not only  striving for the defence of the Gospel, but for the defence of righteousness in  any way. Whether, therefore, in maintaining the truth of God against the lies of  Satan, or defending the good and innocent against the injuries of the bad, we  are obliged to incur the offence and hatred of the world, so as to endanger  life, fortune, or honour, let us not grieve or decline so far to spend ourselves  for God; let us not think ourselves wretched in those things in which he with  his own lips has pronounced us blessed, (<a name="v-p8.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010">Matth. v. 10</a><a name="v-p8.1"></A>.) Poverty, indeed  considered in itself, is misery; so are exile, contempt, imprisonment, ignominy:  in fine, death itself is the last of all calamities. But when the favour of God  breathes upon is, there is none of these things which may not turn out to our  happiness. Let us then be contented with the testimony of Christ rather than  with the false estimate of the flesh, and then, after the example of the  Apostles, we will rejoice in being &#8220;counted worthy to suffer shame for his  name,&#8221; (<a name="v-p8.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041">Acts v. 41</a><a name="v-p8.2"></A>.) For why? If, while conscious of our innocence, we are  deprived of our substance by the wickedness of man, we are, no doubt, humanly  speaking, reduced to poverty; but in truth our riches in heaven are increased:  if driven from our homes we have a more welcome reception into the family of  God; if vexed and despised, we are more firmly rooted in Christ; if stigmatised  by disgrace and ignominy, we have a higher place in the kingdom of God; and if  we are slain, entrance is thereby given us to eternal life. The Lord having set  such a price upon us, let us be ashamed to estimate ourselves at less than the  shadowy and evanescent allurements of the present life.</p> 
<p class="normal"><a name="v-p9"></A>8. Since by these, and similar considerations, Scripture  abundantly solaces us for the ignominy or calamities which we endure in defence  of righteousness, we are very ungrateful if we do not willingly and cheerfully  receive them at the hand of the Lord, especially since this form of the cross is  the most appropriate to believers, being that by which Christ desires to be  glorified in us, as Peter also declares, (<a name="v-p9.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011">1 Pet. 4:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014">14</a><a name="v-p9.1"></A>.) But as to  ingenuous natures, it is more bitter to suffer disgrace than a hundred deaths,  Paul expressly reminds us that not only persecution, but also disgrace awaits  us, &#8220;because we trust in the living God,&#8221; (<a name="v-p9.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010">1 Tim. iv. 10</a><a name="v-p9.2"></A>.) So in another passage  he bids us, after his example, walk &#8220;by evil report and good report,&#8221; (<a name="v-p9.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#008">2 Cor. vi. 8</a><a name="v-p9.3"></A>.) The cheerfulness required, however, does not imply a total insensibility  to pain. The saints could show no patience under the cross if they were not both  tortured with pain and grievously molested. Were there no hardship in poverty,  no pain in disease, no sting in ignominy, no fear in death, where would be the  fortitude and moderation in enduring them? But while every one of these, by its  inherent bitterness, naturally vexes the mind, the believer in this displays his  fortitude, that though fully sensible of the bitterness and labouring  grievously, he still withstands and struggles boldly; in this displays his  patience, that though sharply stung, he is however curbed by the fear of God  from breaking forth into any excess; in this displays his alacrity, that though  pressed with sorrow and sadness, he rests satisfied with spiritual consolation  from God.</p> 
<p class="normal"><a name="v-p10"></A>9. This conflict which believers maintain against the  natural feeling of pain, while they study moderation and patience, Paul  elegantly describes in these words: &#8220;We are troubled on every side, yet not  distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken;  cast down, but not destroyed,&#8221; (<a name="v-p10.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008">2 Cor. 4:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#009">9</a><a name="v-p10.1"></A>.) You see that to bear the cross  patiently is not to have your feelings altogether blunted, and to be absolutely  insensible to pain, according to the absurd description which the Stoics of old  gave of their hero as one who, divested of humanity, was affected in the same  way by adversity and prosperity, grief and joy; or rather, like a stone, was not  affected by anything. And what did they gain by that sublime wisdom? they  exhibited a shadow of patience, which never did, and never can, exist among men.  Nay, rather by aiming at a too exact and rigid patience, they banished it  altogether from human life. Now also we have among Christians a new kind of  Stoics, who hold it vicious not only to groan and weep, but even to be sad and  anxious. These paradoxes are usually started by indolent men who, employing  themselves more in speculation than in action, can do nothing else for us than  beget such paradoxes. But we have nothing to do with that iron philosophy which  our Lord and Master condemned&#8212;not only in word, but also by his own example.  For he both grieved and shed tears for his own and others&#8217; woes. Nor did he  teach his disciples differently: &#8220;Ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall  rejoice,&#8221; (<a name="v-p10.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#020">John xvi. 20</a><a name="v-p10.2"></A>.) And lest any one should regard this as vicious, he  expressly declares, &#8220;Blessed are they that mourn,&#8221; (<a name="v-p10.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#004">Matth. v. 4</a><a name="v-p10.3"></A>.) And no wonder.  If all tears are condemned, what shall we think of our Lord himself, whose  "sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground?&#8221; (<a name="v-p10.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#044">Luke xxii. 44</a><a name="v-p10.4"></A>; <a name="v-p10.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#038">Matth. xxvi. 38</a><a name="v-p10.5"></A>.) If every kind of fear is a mark of unbelief, what  place shall we assign to the dread which, it is said, in no slight degree amazed  him; if all sadness is condemned, how shall we justify him when he confesses,  &#8220;My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death?&#8221;</p> 
<p class="normal"><a name="v-p11"></A>10. I wished to make these observations to keep pious  minds from despair, lest, from feeling it impossible to divest themselves of the  natural feeling of grief, they might altogether abandon the study of patience.  This must necessarily be the result with those who convert patience into stupor,  and a brave and firm man into a block. Scripture gives saints the praise of  endurance when, though afflicted by the hardships they endure, they are not  crushed; though they feel bitterly, they are at the same time filled with  spiritual joy; though pressed with anxiety, breathe exhilarated by the  consolation of God. Still there is a certain degree of repugnance in their  hearts, because natural sense shuns and dreads what is adverse to it, while  pious affection, even through these difficulties, tries to obey the divine will.  This repugnance the Lord expressed when he thus addressed Peter: &#8220;Verily,  verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself and  walkedst whither thou wouldst; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch  forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee; and carry thee whither thou  wouldest not,&#8221; (<a name="v-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#018">John xxi. 18</a><a name="v-p11.1"></A>.) It is not probable, indeed, that when it became  necessary to glorify God by death he was driven to it unwilling and resisting;  had it been so, little praise would have been due to his martyrdom. But though  he obeyed the divine ordination with the greatest alacrity of heart, yet, as he  had not divested himself of humanity, he was distracted by a double will. When  he thought of the bloody death which he was to die, struck with horror, he would  willingly have avoided it: on the other hand, when he considered that it was God  who called him to it, his fear was vanquished and suppressed, and he met death  cheerfully. It must therefore be our study, if we would be disciples of Christ,  to imbue our minds with such reverence and obedience to God as may tame and  subjugate all affections contrary to his appointment. In this way, whatever be  the kind of cross to which we are subjected, we shall in the greatest straits  firmly maintain our patience. Adversity will have its bitterness, and sting us.  When afflicted with disease, we shall groan and be disquieted, and long for  health; pressed with poverty, we shall feel the stings of anxiety and sadness,  feel the pain of ignominy, contempt, and injury, and pay the tears due to nature  at the death of our friends: but our conclusion will always be, The Lord so  willed it, therefore let us follow his will. Nay, amid the pungency of grief,  among groans and tears this thought will necessarily suggest itself and incline  us cheerfully to endure the things for which we are so afflicted.</p> 
<p class="normal"><a name="v-p12"></A>11. But since the chief reason for enduring the cross has  been derived from a consideration of the divine will, we must in few words  explain wherein lies the difference between philosophical and Christian  patience. Indeed, very few of the philosophers advanced so far as to perceive  that the hand of God tries us by means of affliction, and that we ought in this  matter to obey God. The only reason which they adduce is, that so it must be.  But is not this just to say, that we must yield to God, because it is in vain to  contend against him? For if we obey God only because it is necessary, provided  we can escape, we shall cease to obey him. But what Scripture calls us to  consider in the will of God is very different, namely, first justice and equity,  and then a regard to our own salvation. Hence Christian exhortations to patience  are of this nature, Whether poverty, or exile, or imprisonment, or contumely, or  disease, or bereavement, or any such evil affects us, we must think that none of  them happens except by the will and providence of God; moreover, that every  thing he does is in the most perfect order. What! do not our numberless daily  faults deserve to be chastised, more severely, and with a heavier rod than his  mercy lays upon us? Is it not most right that our flesh should be subdued, and  be, as it were, accustomed to the yoke, so as not to rage and wanton as it  lists? Are not the justice and the truth of God worthy of our suffering on their  account?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A>
  But if the equity of God is undoubtedly displayed in affliction, we cannot  murmur or struggle against them without iniquity. We no longer hear the frigid  cant, Yield, because it is necessary; but a living and energetic precept, Obey,  because it is unlawful to resist; bear patiently, because impatience is  rebellion against the justice of God. Then as that only seems to us attractive  which we perceive to be for our own safety and advantage, here also our heavenly  Father consoles us, by the assurance, that in the very cross with which he  afflicts us he provides for our salvation. But if it is clear that tribulations  are salutary to us, why should we not receive them with calm and grateful minds?  In bearing them patiently we are not submitting to necessity but resting  satisfied with our own good. The effect of these thoughts is, that to whatever  extent our minds are contracted by the bitterness which we naturally feel under  the cross, to the same extent will they be expanded with spiritual joy. Hence  arises thanksgiving, which cannot exist unless joy be felt. But if the praise of  the Lord and thanksgiving can emanate only from a cheerful and gladdened breasts  and there is nothing which ought to interrupt these feelings in us, it is clear  how necessary it is to temper the bitterness of the cross with spiritual joy.</p>
