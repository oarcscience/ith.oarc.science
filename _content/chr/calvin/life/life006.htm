<p class="SectionInfo1"><a name="vii-p1"></A>The divisions of this chapter are,&#8212;I. The necessity and  usefulness of this doctrine. Extremes to be avoided, if we would rightly use  the present life and its comforts, sec. 1, 2. II. One of these extremes, viz,  the intemperance of the flesh, to be carefully avoided. Four methods of doing  so described in order, sec. 3&#8211;6.</p>  
<p class="normal"><a name="vii-p2"></A>1. BY such rudiments we are at the same time well instructed  by Scripture in the proper use of earthly blessings, a subject which, in forming  a scheme of life, is by no mean to be neglected. For if we are to live, we must  use the necessary supports of life; nor can we even shun those things which seem  more subservient to delight than to necessity. We must therefore observe a mean,  that we may use them with a pure conscience, whether for necessity or for  pleasure. This the Lord prescribes by his word, when he tells us that to his  people the present life is a kind of pilgrimage by which they hasten to the  heavenly kingdom. If we are only to pass through the earth, there can be no  doubt that we are to use its blessings only in so far as they assist our  progress, rather than retard it. Accordingly, Paul, not without cause,  admonishes us to use this world without abusing it, and to buy possessions as if  we were selling them, (<a name="vii-p2.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#030">1 Cor. 7:30</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031">31</a><a name="vii-p2.1"></A>.) But as this is a slippery place, and  there is great danger of falling on either side, let us fix our feet where we  can stand safely. There have been some good and holy men who, when they saw  intemperance and luxury perpetually carried to excess, if not strictly curbed,  and were desirous to correct so pernicious an evil, imagined that there was no  other method than to allow man to use corporeal goods only in so far as they  were necessaries: a counsel pious indeed, but unnecessarily austere; for it does  the very dangerous thing of binding consciences in closer fetters than those in  which they are bound by the word of God. Moreover, necessity, according to  them,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A>
  was abstinence from every thing which could be wanted, so that they held it  scarcely lawful to make any addition to bread and water. Others were still more  austere, as is related of Cratetes the Theban, who threw his riches into the  sea, because he thought, that unless he destroyed them they would destroy him.  Many also in the present day, while they seek a pretext for carnal intemperance  in the use of external things, and at the same time would pave the way for  licentiousness, assume for granted, what I by no means concede, that this  liberty is not to be restrained by any modification, but that it is to be left  to every man&#8217;s conscience to use them as far as he thinks lawful. I indeed  confess that here consciences neither can nor ought to be bound by fixed and  definite laws; but that Scripture having laid down general rules for the  legitimate uses we should keep within the limits which they prescribe.</p> 
<p class="normal"><a name="vii-p3"></A>2. Let this be our principle, that we err not in the use of  the gifts of Providence when we refer them to the end for which their author  made and destined them, since he created them for our good, and not for our  destruction. No man will keep the true path better than he who shall have this  end carefully in view. Now then, if we consider for what end he created food, we  shall find that he consulted not only for our necessity, but also for our  enjoyment and delight. Thus, in clothing, the end was, in addition to necessity,  comeliness and honour; and in herbs, fruits, and trees, besides their various  uses, gracefulness of appearance and sweetness of smell. Were it not so, the  Prophet would not enumerate among the mercies of God &#8220;wine that maketh glad the  heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine,&#8221; (<a name="vii-p3.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#015">Ps. civ. 15</a><a name="vii-p3.1"></A>.) The Scriptures  would not everywhere mention, in commendation of his benignity, that he had  given such things to men. The natural qualities of things themselves demonstrate  to what end, and how far, they may be lawfully enjoyed. Has the Lord adorned  flowers with all the beauty which spontaneously presents itself to the eye, and  the sweet odour which delights the sense of smell, and shall it be unlawful for  us to enjoy that beauty and this odour? What? Has he not so distinguished  colours as to make some more agreeable than others? Has he not given qualities  to gold and silver, ivory and marble, thereby rendering them precious above  other metals or stones? In short, has he not given many things a value without  having any necessary use?</p> 
<p class="normal"><a name="vii-p4"></A>3. Have done, then, with that inhuman philosophy which, in  allowing no use of the creatures but for necessity, not only maliciously  deprives us of the lawful fruit of the divine beneficence, but cannot be  realised without depriving man of all his senses, and reducing him to a block.  But, on the other hand, let us with no less care guard against the lusts of the  flesh, which, if not kept in order, break through all bounds, and are, as I have  said, advocated by those who, under pretence of liberty, allow themselves every  sort of license. First one restraint is imposed when we hold that the object of  creating all things was to teach us to know their author, and feel grateful for  his indulgence. Where is the gratitude if you so gorge or stupify yourself with  feasting and wine as to be unfit for offices of piety, or the duties of your  calling? Where the recognition of God, if the flesh, boiling forth in lust  through excessive indulgences infects the mind with its impurity, so as to lose  the discernment of&#8217; honour and rectitude? Where thankfulness to God for  clothing, if on account of sumptuous raiment we both admire ourselves and  disdain others? if, from a love of show and splendour, we pave the way for  immodesty? Where our recognition of God, if the glare of these things captivates  our minds? For many are so devoted to luxury in all their senses that their mind  lies buried: many are so delighted with marble, gold, and pictures, that they  become marble-hearted&#8212;are changed as it were into metal, and made like painted  figures. The kitchen, with its savoury smells, so engrosses them that they have  no spiritual savour. The same thing may be seen in other matters. Wherefore, it  is plain that there is here great necessity for curbing licentious abuse, and  conforming to the rule of Paul, &#8220;make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the  lusts thereof,&#8221; (<a name="vii-p4.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014">Rom. xiii. 14</a><a name="vii-p4.1"></A>.) Where too much liberty is given to them, they  break forth without measure or restraint.</p> 
<p class="normal"><a name="vii-p5"></A>4. There is no surer or quicker way of accomplishing this  than by despising the present life and aspiring to celestial immortality. For  hence two rules arise: First, &#8220;it remaineth, that both they that have wives be  as though they had none;#8221; &#8220;and they that use this world, as not abusing it,&#8221; (<a name="vii-p5.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029">1 Cor. 7:29</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031">31</a><a name="vii-p5.1"></A>.) Secondly, we must learn to be no less placid and patient in  enduring penury, than moderate in enjoying abundance. He who makes it his rule  to use this world as if he used it not, not only cuts off all gluttony in regard  to meat and drink, and all effeminacy, ambition, pride, excessive shows and  austerity, in regard to his table, his house, and his clothes, but removes every  care and affection which might withdraw or hinder him from aspiring to the  heavenly life, and cultivating the interest of his soul.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A>
  It was well said by Cato: Luxury causes great care, and produces great  carelessness as to virtue; and it is an old proverb,&#8212;Those who are much  occupied with the care of the body, usually give little care to the soul.  Therefore while the liberty of the Christian in external matters is not to be  tied down to a strict rule, it is, however, subject to this law&#8212;he must indulge  as little as possible; on the other hand, it must be his constant aims not only  to curb luxury, but to cut off all show of superfluous abundance, and carefully  beware of converting a help into an hinderance.</p> 
<p class="normal"><a name="vii-p6"></A>5. Another rule is, that those in narrow and slender  circumstances should learn to bear their wants patiently, that they may not  become immoderately desirous of things, the moderate use of which implies no  small progress in the school of Christ. For in addition to the many other vices  which accompany a longing for earthly good, he who is impatient under poverty  almost always betrays the contrary disease in abundance. By this I mean, that he  who is ashamed of a sordid garment will be vain-glorious of a splendid one; he  who not contented with a slender, feels annoyed at the want of a more luxurious  supper, will intemperately abuse his luxury if he obtains it; he who has a  difficulty, and is dissatisfied in submitting to a private and humble condition,  will be unable to refrain from pride if he attain to honour. Let it be the aim  of all who have any unfeigned desire for piety to learn, after the example of  the Apostle, &#8220;both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer  need,&#8221; (<a name="vii-p6.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012">Philip. iv. 12</a><a name="vii-p6.1"></A>.) Scripture, moreover, has a third rule for modifying the  use of earthly blessings. We have already adverted to it when considering the  offices of charity. For it declares that they have all been given us by the  kindness of God, and appointed for our use under the condition of being regarded  as trusts, of which we must one day give account. We must, therefore, administer  them as if we constantly heard the words sounding in our ears, &#8220;Give an account  of your stewardship.&#8221; At the same time, let us remember by whom the account is  to be taken, viz., by him who, while he so highly commends abstinence, sobriety,  frugality, and moderation, abominates luxury, pride, ostentation, and vanity;  who approves of no administration but that which is combined with charity, who  with his own lips has already condemned all those pleasures which withdraw the  heart from chastity and purity, or darken the intellect.</p> 
<p class="normal"><a name="vii-p7"></A>6. The last thing to be observed is, that the Lord enjoins  every one of us, in all the actions of life, to have respect to our own calling.  He knows the boiling restlessness of the human mind, the fickleness with which  it is borne hither and thither, its eagerness to hold opposites at one time in  its grasp, its ambition. Therefore, lest all things should be thrown into  confusion by our folly and rashness, he has assigned distinct duties to each in  the different modes of life. And that no one may presume to overstep his proper  limits, he has distinguished the different modes of life by the name of  callings. Every man&#8217;s mode of life, therefore, is a kind of station assigned him  by the Lord, that he may not be always driven about at random. So necessary is  this distinction, that all our actions are thereby estimated in his sight, and  often in a very different way from that in which human reason or philosophy  would estimate them. There is no more illustrious deed even among philosophers  than to free one&#8217;s country from tyranny, and yet the private individual who  stabs the tyrant is openly condemned by the voice of the heavenly Judge. But I  am unwilling to dwell on particular examples; it is enough to know that in every  thing the call of the Lord is the foundation and beginning of right action. He  who does not act with reference to it will never, in the discharge of duty, keep  the right path. He will sometimes be able, perhaps, to give the semblance of  something laudable, but whatever it may be in the sight of man, it will be  rejected before the throne of God; and besides, there will be no harmony in the  different parts of his life. Hence, he only who directs his life to this end  will have it properly framed; because free from the impulse of rashness, he will  not attempt more than his calling justifies, knowing that it is unlawful to  overleap the prescribed bounds. He who is obscure will not decline to cultivate  a private life, that he may not desert the post at which God has placed him.  Again, in all our cares, toils, annoyances, and other burdens, it will be no  small alleviation to know that all these are under the superintendence of God.  The magistrate will more willingly perform his office, and the father of a  family confine himself to his proper sphere. Every one in his particular mode of  life will, without repining, suffer its inconveniences, cares, uneasiness, and  anxiety, persuaded that God has laid on the burden. This, too, will afford  admirable consolation, that in following your proper calling, no work will be so  mean and sordid as not to have a splendour and value in the eye of God.</p>
