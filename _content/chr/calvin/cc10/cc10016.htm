<p><a name="xvii-p2"></A>As kings, and such as are invested with authority, through the blindness which is produced by pride, generally take to themselves a boundless liberty of action, the Psalmist warns them that they must render an account at the bar of the Supreme Judge, who is exalted above the highest of this world. After he has reminded them of their duty and condition, perceiving that he speaks to such as refuse to receive admonition, he calls upon God to 		  vindicate his character as a righteous judge.  		  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_420"></A><A HREF="#fn_420"><FONT SIZE="1">421</FONT></A>

 			  It is unquestionably a very unbecoming thing for those whom God has been pleased to invest with the government of mankind for the common good, not to acknowledge the end for which they have been exalted above others, nor yet by whose blessing they have been placed in so elevated a station; but instead of doing this, contemning every principle of equity, to rule just as their own unbridled passions dictate. So infatuated are they by their own 			 splendor and magnificence, as to imagine that the whole world was made only for them. Besides, they think that it would derogate from their elevated rank were they to be governed by moderate counsels; and although their own folly is more than enough to urge them on in their reckless career, they, notwithstanding, seek for flatterers to soothe and applaud them in their vices. To correct this arrogance, the psalm opens by asserting, that although men occupy thrones and judgment-seats, God 			 nevertheless continues to hold the office of supreme ruler. God has made even a heathen and licentious poet bear testimony to this truth in the following lines: &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent31"><a name="xvii.i-p11"></A><i>&#8220;</i><a name="xvii.i-p11.1"></A><i>Regum timendorum in proprios greges, <br> 			 Reges in ipsos imperium est Jovis, <br> 			 Clari giganteo triumpho, <br> 			 Cuncta supercilio moventis</i><i>.&#8221; <br> 			 </i>Horatii, Carm. Liber in Ode i.</p>  		  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent31"><a name="xvii.i-p12"></A><i>&#8220;Kings rule their subject flocks; great Jove <br> 			 O&#8217;er kings themselves his reign extends, <br> 			 Who hurl&#8217;d the rebel giants from above; <br> 			 At whose majestic nod all nature bends.&#8221; <br> 			 </i>Boscawen&#8217;s Translation.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p13"></A>That the potentates of this world may not arrogate to themselves more than belongs to them, the prophet here erects a throne for <i>God, </i>from which he judges them all, and represses their pride; a thing which is highly necessary. They may, indeed, admit that they owe their elevation to royal power to the favor of God, and they may worship him by outward ceremonies, but their greatness so infatuates them that they are chargeable with 			 expelling and casting him to a distance from their assembly, by their vain imaginations; for they cannot bear to be subject to reason and laws. Thus the design of the prophet was to deride the madness by which the princes of this world are bewitched, in leaving God no place in their assembly. The more effectually to overthrow this irrational self-confidence with which they are intoxicated, civil order is termed <i>the assembly of God; </i>for although the divine glory shines forth in every part 			 of the world, yet when lawful government flourishes among men, it is reflected therefrom with pre-eminent lustre. I indeed grant that it is quite common for the Hebrews to adorn with the title of <i>God </i>whatever is rare and excellent. But here it would appear, from the scope of the passage, that this name of the Divine Being is applied to those who occupy the exalted station of princes, in which there is afforded a peculiar manifestation of the majesty of God; even as Solomon, in 			 <a name="xvii.i-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017">Pr 2:17</a><a name="xvii.i-p13.1"></A>, calls marriage &#8220;the covenant of God,&#8221; from the peculiar sanctity by which that relation is distinguished.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p14"></A>In the second clause of the verse, it is not material whether we read, <i>He will judge in the midst of the gods, </i>or, <i>He will judge the gods in the midst.</i> The first construction, however, is the most 			 easy and natural, That however much the rulers of the world may exalt themselves, they cannot in the least impair the authority of God, by divesting him of his sovereignty over them and of the government of all things, which he will ever retain as his inalienable prerogative. But here, as also a little after, the name <i>gods </i>is to be understood of <i>judges, </i>on whom God has impressed special marks of 			 his glory. To apply it to angels is a fancy too strained to admit of serious consideration.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p15"></A><a name="xvii.i-p15.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p16"></A><b>2</b>  <i>How long will ye judge unjustly?</i> Many suppose that God is here introduced speaking, and that these are the words which he utters from his throne of judgment. But I would rather consider the prophet himself as the speaker, who, in order to prepare the way for 			 administering a rebuke, had spoken in the manner in which he did in the first verse. Kings may lift up their heads above the clouds, but they, as well as the rest of mankind, are under the government of God; and such being the case, it is in vain for them arrogantly to struggle to obtain exemption from the obligations of reason. Yet this is what they do. Although tyrants are amongst the basest of men, and occupy their exalted station by detestable treason, yet if any servant of God has the 			 fortitude to open his mouth against them, they immediately attempt to shelter themselves by appealing to the sacred name of God, as if great wrong had been done to them. Thus, whilst they persuade themselves that they are privileged with exemption from the law to which the rest of mankind are subject, they endeavor to deprive the common people of divine truth and its ministers. In short, they think that there can be no sovereignty unless where uncontrolled license is enjoyed. But let this 			 principle be once established, &#8220;That God rules among them,&#8221; and then a way is opened up for the admission of divine truth. Accordingly, the prophet, after having thus laid a foundation for his authority, freely inveighs against princes, and reproves the very gross vice of selling themselves to those who unrighteously oppress the poor, and of being gained by bribes to pervert in their administration every principle of justice. He expressly names the <i>wicked; </i>for good men will never attempt to corrupt judges. Moreover, there is a certain devilish frenzy which infatuates the princes of the world, and leads them voluntarily to pay greater respect to wicked men than to the simple and innocent. Even supposing that the wicked continue inactive, and use no endeavors to obtain for themselves favor either by flattery, fraud, bribery, or other artifices; yet those who bear rule are for the most part inclined of themselves to the bad side. The 			 reason why the prophet upbraids them is, that wicked men find more favor at their hands than the good and conscientious.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p17"></A><a name="xvii.i-p17.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p18"></A><b>3</b> <i> Determine the cause of the poor and the orphan.</i> We are here briefly taught that a just and well-regulated government will be distinguished for maintaining the rights of the poor and afflicted. By the figure synecdoche, one part of equitable administration is put for the whole; for it 			 cannot be doubted that rulers are bound to observe justice towards all men without distinction. But the prophet, with much propriety, represents them as appointed to be the defenders of the miserable and oppressed, both because such persons stand in need of the assistance of others, and because they can only obtain this where rulers are free from avarice, ambition, and other vices. The end, therefore, for which judges bear the sword is to restrain the wicked, and thus to prevent violence from 			 prevailing among men, who are so much disposed to become disorderly and outrageous. According as men increase in strength, they become proportionally audacious in oppressing the weak; and hence it is that rich men seldom resort to magistrates for help, except when they happen to fall out among themselves. From these remarks, it is very obvious why the cause of the poor and needy is here chiefly commended to rulers; for those who are exposed an easy prey to the cruelty and wrongs of the rich 			 have no less need of the assistance and protection of magistrates than the sick have of the aid of the physician. Were the truth deeply fixed in the minds of kings and other judges, that they are appointed to be the guardians of the poor, and that a special part of this duty lies in resisting the wrongs which are done to them, and in repressing all unrighteous violence, perfect righteousness would become triumphant through the whole world. Whoever thinks it not beneath him to defend the poor, 			 instead of allowing himself to be carried hither and thither by favor, will have a regard only to what is right. We may farther learn from this passage, that although magistrates may not be solicited for succor, they are accounted guilty before God of negligence, if they do not, of their own accord, succor those who stand in need of their interference. When iniquity openly prevails, and when, on account of it, sighs and lamentations are everywhere heard, it is in vain for them to pretend that 			 they cannot redress wrongs, unless complaints are addressed to them. Oppression utters a sufficiently loud cry of itself; and if the judge, sitting on a high watch-tower, seems to take no notice of it, he is here plainly warned, that such connivance shall not escape with impunity.</p>  <a name="xvii.ii"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption20"><a name="xvii.ii-p1"></A><a name="xvii.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#005">Psalm 82:5-8</a><a name="xvii.ii-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p2"></A><b>5.</b> They know not, neither do they understand: they walk in darkness, although all the foundations of the earth are moved. <b>6.</b> I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you sons of the Most High. <b>7.</b> But ye shall die as a man; and ye shall fall, O princes: as one of the people. <b>8.</b> Arise, O God! Judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.</p>

 			  After having reminded princes of their duty, the Psalmist complains that his admonition from their infatuation is ineffectual, and that they refuse to receive wholesome instruction; yea, that although the whole world is shaken to its foundations, they, notwithstanding, continue thoughtless and secure in the neglect of their duty. He chiefly reprobates and condemns their madness as manifested in this, that although they see heaven and earth 			 involved in confusion, they are no more affected at the sight than if the care of the interests of mankind did not belong to them, of which they are, notwithstanding, in an especial manner the chosen and appointed conservators. I have stated a little before, that what chiefly deprives them of understanding is, that, being dazzled with their own splendor, and perversely shaking off every yoke, no religious considerations have the effect of inclining them to moderation. All sound knowledge and 			 wisdom must commence with yielding to God the honor which is his due, and submitting to be restrained and governed by his word. The last clause of the verse, <i>Although all the foundations of the earth are moved,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_425"></A><A HREF="#fn_425"><FONT SIZE="1">426</FONT></A>
 			  is almost universally understood by interpreters in a different sense from that in which I have rendered it. They explain it as implying, that of all the calamities in the world the greatest is when princes neglect to execute the duties of their office; for it is the observance and prevalence of justice which constitutes the foundation on which the fabric of human society rests. Thus the sense, according to them, is, that the world is 			 undermined and overthrown by the unjust tyranny of princes. I am far from rejecting this interpretation; but, as I have already hinted, I am more inclined to think, that we have here condemned the monstrous stupidity of judges, who can remain indifferent and unmoved in beholding the horrible confusion of civil society, yea even the very earth shaken to its foundations.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.ii-p8"></A><a name="xvii.ii-p8.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p9"></A><b>6</b>  <i>I have said, ye are gods.</i> God has invested judges with a sacred character and title. This the prophet concedes; but he, at the same time, shows that this will afford no support and protection to wicked judges. He does not introduce them as speaking of the 			 dignity of their office; but anticipating the style of reasoning which they would be disposed to adopt, he replies, &#8220;If you appeal to your dignity as an argument to shield you, this boasting will avail you nothing; yea, rather you are deceiving yourselves by your foolish confidence; for God, in appointing you his substitutes, has not divested himself of his own sovereignty as supreme ruler. Again, he would have you to remember your own frailty as a means of stirring you up to execute with fear 			 and trembling the office intrusted to you.&#8221; This verse may also be viewed as addressed by God himself to rulers, and as intimating, that, in addition to his clothing them with authority, he has bestowed upon them his name. This interpretation seems to agree with the language of Christ in <a name="xvii.ii-p9.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#034">Joh 10:34</a><a name="xvii.ii-p9.1"></A>, where he speaks of those as called gods to whom the word of God came. The passage, 			 however, may be appropriately resolved thus: <i>I grant that ye are gods, and the sons of the Most High</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_426"></A><A HREF="#fn_426"><FONT SIZE="1">427</FONT></A>
 			  But this does not materially alter the meaning. The object is simply to teach that the dignity with which judges are invested can form no excuse or plea why they should escape the punishment which their wickedness deserves. The government of the world has been committed to them upon the distinct understanding that they themselves also must one day appear at the judgment-seat of heaven to render up an account. The dignity, therefore, with 			 which they are clothed is only temporary, and will pass away with the fashion of the world. Accordingly, it is added in the 7th verse, <i>But ye shall die as men. </i>You are armed with power, as if he had said, to govern the world; but you have not on that account ceased to be men, so as to be no longer subject to mortality. The last clause of the verse is translated by some expositors, <i>Ye shall fall like one of the 			 princes;</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_427"></A><A HREF="#fn_427"><FONT SIZE="1">428</FONT></A>
 			  but in my opinion improperly. They think that it contains a threatening of the violent death which would befall these unrighteous judges, corresponding to the sentiment of these lines of a heathen poet: &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent19"><a name="xvii.ii-p12"></A>&#8220;<a name="xvii.ii-p12.1"></A>Ad generum Cereris sine caede et sanguine pauci, <br> 			 Descendunt reges, et sicca morte tyranni.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p13"></A>&#8220;Few kings and tyrants go down to Pluto, the son-in-law of Ceres, without being put to a violent death, before they have completed the ordinary term allotted to the life of mortal man.&#8221;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_428"></A><A HREF="#fn_428"><FONT SIZE="1">429</FONT></A>
 			 That translation being forced, and not such as the words naturally suggest, I have no doubt that princes are here compared to the obscure and common class of mankind. The word <i>one </i>signifies any of the common people. Forgetting themselves to be men, the great ones of the earth may flatter themselves with visionary hopes of immortality; but they are here taught that they will be compelled to encounter death as well as other men. Christ, with the view of rebutting the calumny with 			 which the Pharisees loaded him, quoted this text, <a name="xvii.ii-p14.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#034">John 10:34</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#035">35</a><a name="xvii.ii-p14.1"></A>, &#8220;Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken; say ye of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?&#8221; By these words Christ did not mean 			 to place himself among the order of judges; but he argues from the less to the greater, that if the name of God is applied to God&#8217;s officers, it with much more propriety belongs to his only begotten Son, who is the express image of the Father, in whom the Father&#8217;s majesty shines forth, and in whom the whole fullness of the Godhead dwells.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.ii-p15"></A><a name="xvii.ii-p15.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p16"></A><b>8</b>  <i>Arise, O God! judge the earth.</i> The reason why this psalm concludes with a prayer has been already stated at the commencement. The prophet, finding that his admonitions and remonstrances were ineffectual, and that princes, inflated with pride, treated with 			 contempt all instruction on the principles of equity, addresses himself to God, and calls upon Him to repress their insolence. By this means, the Holy Spirit furnishes us with ground of comfort whenever we are cruelly treated by tyrants. We may perceive no power on earth to restrain their excesses; but it becomes us to lift up our eyes to heaven, and to seek redress from Him whose office it is to judge the world, and who does not claim this office to himself in vain. It is therefore our bounden 			 duty to beseech him to restore to order what is embroiled in confusion. The reason of this which immediately follows &#8212; <i>for thou shalt inherit all nations</i> &#8212; is understood by some as a prophecy concerning the kingdom of Christ, by whom God has brought all nations in subjection to himself. But it is to be viewed in a more extensive 			 sense, as implying that God has a rightful claim to the obedience of all nations, and that tyrants are chargeable with wickedly and unjustly wresting from him his prerogative of bearing rule, when they set at nought his authority, and confound good and evil, right and wrong. We ought therefore to beseech him to restore to order the confusions of the world, and thus to recover the rightful dominion which he has over it.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii-p3"></A> Kimchi thinks it probable that this psalm was written in the days of Jehoshaphat, and refers to <a name="xvii-p3.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#005">2Ch 19:5-7</a><a name="xvii-p3.1"></A>, as indicating the time and occasion of its composition. We are there informed that Jehoshaphat; &#8220;set judges in the land, throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city;&#8221; and in instructing them with regard to their duty, he uses nearly the 				same words as those in the beginning of this psalm. Dr Morison takes a different view. &#8220;This psalm,&#8221; says he, &#8220;was composed in all probability in the days of Hezekiah, in reference to certain wicked magistrates, (<a name="xvii-p3.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030">2Ch 29:30</a><a name="xvii-p3.2"></A>,) who had grievously perverted the administration of justice, who were guilty of great oppression, and who had done much to introduce a state of general national corruption. King 				Jehoshaphat had reformed several public abuses which had crept into the judicatories of Israel in his time, (<a name="xvii-p3.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#007">2Ch 19:7</a><a name="xvii-p3.3"></A>,) but before the reign of Hezekiah, things had reverted to their former unhappy condition; so that a public national reformation was loudly demanded. The psalm contains an exhortation to the judges of Israel, and a reproof for their negligence and oppression.&#8221;</p> 		  </P>

Gataker also considers <a name="xvii.ii-p11.5"></A>&#1492;&#1513;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, to be in the vocative case, which is approved by Horsley, Berlin, 				  and others. Dathe takes <a name="xvii.ii-p11.6"></A>&#1492;&#1513;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; in the sense of <i>tyrants</i>, but brings no authority to prove that the word has this sense. Le Clerc, in the latter part of the verse, after <i>like one of</i>, supplies 				  <i>the many</i>, reading, &#8220;And fall, O ye princes! like one of the many.&#8221;</p> 			 </P>
