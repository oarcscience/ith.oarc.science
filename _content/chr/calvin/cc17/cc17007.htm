<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref23"><a name="viii-p1"></A>THE PRINTER TO THE CHRISTIAN READER,</p>  		
<p class="3rdLevelSmallCap12Bld24"><a name="viii-p2"></A>HEALTH.</p>  		
<p><a name="viii-p3"></A>Though Readers were sufficiently reminded, when the Lectures of the beloved and learned John Calvin, on The Minor Prophets and on Daniel, were published, by what means and by whom they had been attained, so that it is to no purpose to sing the same song, for so would I seem to do, were I again to explain at large what has been before set forth; it is yet necessary, if I am not mistaken, to add now, that these Lectures On Jeremiah and the 		  Lamentations were taken down by our two brethren, <i>John Budeus </i>and <i>Charles Jonville, </i>with the same care, fidelity, and diligence as the former Lectures, which cannot but appear to every one who will attentively read them.</p>  		
<p><a name="viii-p4"></A>The Hebrew Text has not been inserted; and among other things, for this reason, because it is already possessed by those who understand the language, and to others it would be of no advantage. We were also afraid, that by increasing the Volume and the expense, we should unnecessarily charge the buyer.</p>  		
<p><a name="viii-p5"></A>But that I may not be prolix and tedious, I pass by the great and manifold benefit that may be derived from this Volume, which will appear to each one better when it is read: for it is so replete with the precious wealth of heavenly Truth, that from it, as from a storehouse, may be drawn the sum and substance of Religion; and so it will no doubt be of great service to the whole Church of God.</p>  		
<p><a name="viii-p6"></A>It remains for you, Christian Reader, to ascribe to God alone whatever benefit you may derive from these Commentaries; and to pray for Calvin, who well deserves this from all the godly, until he shall at length enjoy his eternal inheritance. Make use also thankfully of this so valuable a treasure, and judge kindly and impartially of what is cordially presented to you.</p>
