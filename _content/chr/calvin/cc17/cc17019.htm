<p><a name="xx.i-p3"></A><b>1 </b>The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, <i>one </i>of the priests who were in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Even the word of Jehovah came to him in the days of Josiah, the son of Amon, The king of Judah, in the tenth year of his reign;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p5"></A><b>3</b> And it came in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, to the transmigration of Jerusalem in the fifth month.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p6"></A><b>4 </b>And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee; Before thou camest forth from the womb, I sanctified thee; A prophet to the nations have I made thee.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p8"></A><b>6 </b>And I said, &#8212; Ah! Lord Jehovah, Behold, I know not how to speak, for I am a child.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p9"></A><b>7 </b>And Jehovah said to me, &#8212; Say not, I am a child; For wheresoever I send thee, thou shalt go; And whatsoever I command thee, thou shalt say:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p10"></A><b>8 </b>Fear not their face, for I am with thee, To deliver thee, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p11"></A><b>9 </b>And Jehovah extended his hand and touched my mouth; and Jehovah said to me, &#8212; Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p12"></A><b>10 </b>See, I have set thee today Over nations and over kingdoms, To pull down and to destroy, To root up and to demolish, To build and to plant. (<b>1:47</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p13"></A><b>11 </b>Then the word of Jehovah came to me saying, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, The rod of a watcher <i>is what </i>I see.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Then Jehovah said to me, Thou hast rightly seen, for I watch over my word to do it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p15"></A><b>13 </b>And the word of Jehovah came to me again, saying, What seest thou? And I said, A pot boiling <i>is what </i>I see; its face is towards the north.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p16"></A><b>14 </b>And Jehovah said to me, &#8212; From the north shall break forth an evil On all the inhabitants of the land:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p17"></A><b>15 </b>For behold, I am calling all the families Of the kingdoms of the north, saith Jehovah; And they shall come, <i>and </i>set shall each his throne, At the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, And on all its walls around, And on all the cities of Judah:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p18"></A><b>16 </b>And I will execute my judgments on them For all their wickedness; Because they have forsaken me, And have burnt incense to strange gods, And bowed down to the works of their own hands. (<b>1:58</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p19"></A><b>17 </b>Thou then, gird thy loins and arise, And speak to them whatsoever I command thee; Fear not their face, Lest I dismay thee before them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p20"></A><b>18 </b>And I, behold I have made thee this day A fortified city, an iron pillar, And a brazen wall, as to the whole land, Against the kings of Judah, Against his princes, against his priests, Against the people of the land:</p>

<p><a name="xx.ii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, Saying, Thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; I remember thee for <i>my </i>kindness to thine youth And <i>my</i> love at thy espousal, When thou didst follow me in the desert, In a land not sown. (<b>1:70</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Holiness <i>was </i>Israel to Jehovah, The first-fruits of his increase: Whosoever devour him shall be punished, Evil shall come upon them, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Hear the word of Jehovah, ye house of Jacob, And all the families of the house of Israel:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; What iniquity did your fathers find in me? For they alienated themselves from me, And walked after vanity, and became vain; (<b>1:75</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>And they said not, &#8220;Where is Jehovah, Who brought us out of the land of Egypt, And led us through the wilderness, In a land waste and rugged, In a land horrible and deadly, In a land through which none passed, And in which no man dwelt?&#8221; (<b>1:79</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>And I brought you into a fertile land, To eat its fruit and its abundance; But ye entered and polluted my land, And my heritage have ye made an abomination:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>The priests said not, &#8220;Where is Jehovah?&#8221; And they who handled the law, knew not me; And the pastors dealt treacherously with me, And the prophets prophesied by Baal, And after things which did not profit, they walked.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Therefore still will I contend with you, saith Jehovah; And with your children&#8217;s children will I contend.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>For pass over to the isles of Chittim, and see; And to Kedar send, and consider diligently; And see whether such a thing as this has been done &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>Has a nation changed its gods, Though they are no gods? Yet my people have changed their glory Unto that which does not profit.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Be astonished, ye heavens, at this, and terrified, Be ye wholly desolated, saith Jehovah: (<b>1:92</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Surely, two evils have my people done, &#8212; Me have they forsaken, the fountain of living waters, And dug have they for themselves cisterns, Broken cisterns, which hold no waters!</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p16"></A><b>14 </b>Is Israel a servant? Is he one born in the house? Why is he become a prey?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p17"></A><b>15 </b>Over him roar the lions, They have raised their voice; They have made his land waste; His cities are burnt up, Without an inhabitant.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p18"></A><b>16 </b>Even the children of Noph and Thaphanes Do break thy crown.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p19"></A><b>17 </b>Hast thou not done this for thyself, By forsaking Jehovah thy God, While he was leading thee in the way?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p20"></A><b>18 </b>And now what hast thou to do in the way to Egypt, That thou mightest drink the waters of the Nile? And what hast thou to do in the way to Assyria, That thou mightest drink of the water of the river?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p21"></A><b>19 </b>Chastise thee shall thine own wickedness, And thy apostasies, they shall punish thee; And thou shalt understand and know, That it is an evil and a bitter thing for thee To have forsaken Jehovah thy God, And that my fear has not been in thee, Saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p22"></A><b>20 </b>For of old have I broken thy yoke, Have I burst thy bands; But thou hast said, &#8220;I will not serve;&#8221; For on every high hill and under every shady tree Hast thou rambled like a harlot. (<b>1:107</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p23"></A><b>21 </b>I indeed planted thee a choice vine, Altogether a good seed; How then art thou turned to me A degenerated foreign vine!</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p24"></A><b>22 </b>Even though thou washest thyself with nitre, And multipliest to thee the herb of the fuller; <i>Yet </i>imprinted is thine iniquity Before my face, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p25"></A><b>23 </b>How canst thou say, &#8220;I am not polluted, After Baalim have I not gone?&#8221; See thy ways in the valley, Know what thou hast done, &#8212; <i>Thou </i>swift dromedary, traversing her ways, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p26"></A><b>24 </b>A wild she-ass, used to the desert, In her own lust snuffing up the wind she meets with: Who can thence bring her back? Whosoever seeks her, needs not weary himself; In her month will he find her. (<b>1:118</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p27"></A><b>25 </b>Keep thy foot from being unshod, And thy throat from thirst: Yet thou hast said, &#8220;It is all over, No, for I have loved strangers, And after them will I go.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p28"></A><b>26 </b>As there is shame to a thief when caught, So ashamed shall be the house of Israel, Their kings and their princes, Their priests and their prophets, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p29"></A><b>27 </b>Who say to the wood, &#8220;My father art thou;&#8221; And to the stone, &#8220;Thou hast begotten me:&#8221; For they have turned to me the back, not the face; But in the time of their calamity they say, &#8220;Arise and save us.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p30"></A><b>28 </b>But where are thy gods, Which thou hast made for thyself? Let them arise, if they can save thee In the time of thy calamity; For according to the number of thy cities Have been thy gods, O Judah!</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p31"></A><b>29 </b>Why do ye contend with me? Ye have all dealt perfidiously with me, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p32"></A><b>30 </b>In vain have I chastised your children; Correction they received not; Devoured has the sword your prophets, As a destroying lion.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p33"></A><b>31 </b>O generation! see ye the word of Jehovah; Have I been a desert to Israel, or a land of darkness? Wherefore have my people said, &#8212; &#8220;We have ruled, we will come no more to thee.&#8221; (<b>1:135</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p34"></A><b>32 </b>Can a maid forget her ornaments, A spouse her attire? But my people have forgotten me, Days without number.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p35"></A><b>33 </b>Why trimmest thou thy ways to seek love? Thou hast even thus taught wickedness by thy ways.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p36"></A><b>34 </b>Even in thy skirts is found The blood of the souls of the poor innocents; Not in digging under have they been found, But on account of all these things: (<b>1:143</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p37"></A><b>35 </b>Yet thou hast said, &#8220;Surely I am clean; Only let his fury depart from me.&#8221; Behold I will contend with thee in judgment, Because thou hast said, &#8220;I have not sinned.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p38"></A><b>36 </b>Why ramblest thou so much to change thy ways? Even of Egypt shalt thou be ashamed, As thou hast been ashamed of Assyria.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p39"></A><b>37 </b>Even now for this thou shalt go forth, And thine hands on thine head; For abhorred hath Jehovah thy confidences, And in them thou shalt not prosper. (<b>1:151</b>)</p>  <a name="xx.iii"></A>

<p><a name="xx.iii-p3"></A><b>1 </b>It is said, when a man puts away his wife, And she goes from him to another man, Shall he return to her again? Would not the land be thus greatly polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many friends; Yet return to me, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Raise thine eyes to the high places, And see where thou hast played the harlot: By the ways thou didst sit for them, As the Arabian in the desert; And polluted hast thou the land With thy whoredoms and thy wickedness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Restrained therefore have been the showers, And the late rain has not been; Yet the front of a strumpet has been thine, Thou hast refused to be ashamed.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Wilt thou not hereafter cry to me, &#8212; &#8220;My Father, the guide of my youth art thou?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Will he keep <i>wrath </i>for ever? Will he reserve it perpetually?&#8221; Behold, thou hast spoken, And hast done evils with all thy might. (<b>1:162</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>And Jehovah said to me in the days of Josiah the king, &#8212; Hast thou seen what the apostate Israel has done? She went on every high mountain And under every shady tree, And played there the harlot:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>And I said, after she had done all these things, &#8220;Return to me;&#8220; but she returned not; And see this did her perfidious sister Judah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>And I saw, that when for all these things, Because rebellious Israel had played the harlot, I had dismissed her and given her a bill of divorce, Yet fear did not her perfidious sister Judah, But went and played also the harlot. (<b>1:166</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>And it happened through the levity of her whoredom, That she polluted the land, And played the harlot with stone and with wood.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>And yet after all this, returned to me Has not her perfidious sister Judah, With her whole heart, but feignedly, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>And Jehovah said to me, &#8212; Justified herself has apostate Israel Rather than perfidious Judah:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Go and publish these words towards the north, And say, Return, rebellious Israel, saith Jehovah; I will not let fall my wrath upon you, For I am merciful, saith Jehovah; I will not keep it for ever:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p15"></A><b>13 </b>But know thine iniquity, That against Jehovah thy God thou hast acted wickedly, And prostituted thy ways to strangers Under every shady tree; (<b>1:176</b>) And to my voice thou didst not hearken, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p16"></A><b>14 </b>Return, ye rebellious children, saith Jehovah; For I am your husband; And I will take you, one from a city, And two from a family, and bring you to Sion;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p17"></A><b>15 </b>And will give you pastors according to my heart, And they shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p18"></A><b>16 </b>And it shall be, when ye shall multiply and increase In the land, in those days, saith Jehovah, That they will no more say, &#8212; &#8220;The ark of the covenant of Jehovah;&#8221; And it shall not come to mind, And they shall not remember nor visit it; Even <i>this </i>shall not be done any more. (<b>1:185</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p19"></A><b>17 </b>At that time they shall call Jerusalem, The throne of Jehovah; And assemble to it shall all nations, For the name of Jehovah, even to Jerusalem; And walk shall they no more After the evil hardness of their own hearts. (<b>1:186</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p20"></A><b>18 </b>In those days shall come The house of Judah with the house of Israel; Together shall they come from the land of the north, To the land which I have given For an inheritance to your fathers.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p21"></A><b>19 </b>But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, And give thee the desirable land, The heritage coveted by hosts of nations? And I said, &#8220;My Father,&#8221; shalt thou call me, And from me thou wilt not depart. (<b>1:189</b>)</p>

<p><a name="xx.viii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>I hearkened and heard; they will not speak aright; There is no one who repents of his wickedness, And says, &#8220;What have I done?&#8221; Every one turns to his own course, Like a horse who rushes into battle. (<b>1:425</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.viii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Even the stork in the heavens knows its times; The turtle also, and the swallow and the crane, Observe the time of their journey; But my people know not the judgment of Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.viii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>How say ye, &#8220;We are wise And the law of Jehovah is with us:&#8221; Surely, behold in vain Hath the writer prepared his pen, In vain are the scribes!</p>

<p><a name="xx.viii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>I will therefore give their wives to aliens, And their fields to inheritors; For from the least even to the greatest, Every one is given to covetousness; From the prophet even to the priest, All have acted deceitfully;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.viii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>And healed have they the wound Of the daughter of my people slightly, By saying, &#8220;Peace, peace,&#8221; when there was no peace.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.viii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Had they shame, that they had done abomination? Even of shame they were not ashamed, And how to blush they knew not: Fall therefore shall they with the fallen; At the time of their visitation They shall perish, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.viii-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Destroying, I will destroy them, saith Jehovah; No grapes <i>shall be </i>on the vine, And no figs on the fig-tree; The leaf also shall fall, And what I gave them shall pass from them.</p>

<p><a name="xx.viii-p17"></A><b>15 </b>We looked for peace, but there was no good; For time of healing, but behold terror.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.viii-p18"></A><b>16 </b>From Dan is heard the snorting of his horses; At the sound of the neighing of his strong ones, Tremble does the whole land; For they will come and devour The land and its abundance, The city and its inhabitants.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.viii-p19"></A><b>17 </b>For behold, I will send among you Serpents and basilisks, Which will not be charmed; And they shall bite you, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.viii-p20"></A><b>18 </b>I would strengthen myself against grief: <i>But</i> within me my heart is weak.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.viii-p21"></A><b>19 </b>Behold the voice of the crying Of the daughter of my people from a far country! &#8220;Is not Jehovah in Sion? Is not her king within her?&#8221; &#8212; Why have they provoked me to wrath With their images, with foreign vanities?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.viii-p22"></A><b>20 </b>Past has the harvest, ended is the summer, And we have not been saved! (<b>1:452</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.viii-p23"></A><b>21 </b>For the hurt of the daughter of my people I am hurt, I am become black; Astonishment has laid hold on me.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.viii-p24"></A><b>22 </b>Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? For why is not restored The healing of the daughter of my people! (<b>1:456</b>)</p>  <a name="xx.ix"></A>

<p><a name="xx.ix-p3"></A><b>1 </b>Who will make my head waters And mine eye a fountain of tears! Then would I bewail, day and night, The slain of the daughter of my people.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ix-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Who will set me in the desert, In the lodging of travelers! Then would I leave my people And depart from them: For all of them are adulterers, An assembly of perfidious men.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ix-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And they shoot lies with their tongue as with a bow; But not for truth are they strong in the land; For from evil to evil they proceed; (<b>1:462</b>) And me they know not, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ix-p6"></A><b>4 </b>And every one of his friend take ye heed, And in a brother trust ye not; For every brother by supplanting will supplant, And every friend walks fraudulently:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ix-p7"></A><b>5 </b>And a man deceives his neighbor, And the truth he speaks not; They have taught their tongues to speak falsehood; With doing evil they weary themselves.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ix-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Thou dwellest in the midst of deceit; Through deceit they refuse To know me, saith Jehovah. (<b>1:469</b>)</p>

<p><a name="xx.ix-p12"></A><b>10 </b>For the mountains will I raise up weeping and wailing, For the pastures of the wilderness, lamentation; Because they are laid waste, So that there is not a man passing through, And they hear not the voice of cattle; From the bird of heaven to the beast. Have they fled, have they departed. (<b>1:475</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ix-p13"></A><b>11 </b>I will also make Jerusalem heaps, A place for dragons; And the cities of Judah will I make a waste, So that there shall be no inhabitant.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ix-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Who is a wise man to understand this? And to whom has Jehovah&#8217;s mouth spoken, That he may declare why the land is to perish &#8212; Is to be laid waste like the desert, So that no man should pass through? (<b>1:480</b>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ix-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Then Jehovah said, &#8212; Because they have forsaken my law, Which I have set before them, And hearkened not to my voice, Nor walked according to it;</p>

<p><a name="xx.ix-p18"></A><b>16 </b>I will also scatter them among the nations, Whom they have not known nor their fathers, And I will send after them the sword, Until I shall have consumed them.</p>

<p><a name="xx.ix-p21"></A><b>19 </b>For a voice of wailing is heard from Sion, &#8220;How we are wasted! How greatly shamed! Because we have left the land, They have cast down our dwellings.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ix-p22"></A><b>20 </b>Therefore hear, ye women, the word of Jehovah, And let your ears receive the word of his mouth, And teach your daughters wailing, And each one her friend lamentation:</p>
