<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.i-p18"></A><a name="xiv.i-p18.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p19"></A>As, in the event of the Corinthians retaining any feeling of offense, occasioned by the severity of the preceding Epistle, that might stand in the way of Paul&#8217;s authority having influence over them, he has hitherto made it his endeavor to conciliate their affections. Now, after clearing away all occasion of offense, and regaining favor for his ministry, he recommends to them the brethren at Jerusalem, that they may furnish help to their 			 necessities. He could not, with any great advantage, have attempted this in the commencement of the Epistle. Hence, he has prudently deferred it, until he has prepared their minds for it. Accordingly, he takes up the whole of this chapter, and the next, in exhorting the Corinthians to be active and diligent in collecting alms to be taken to Jerusalem for relieving the indigence of the brethren. For they were afflicted with a great famine, so that they could scarcely support life without being 			 aided by other churches. The Apostles had intrusted Paul with this matter, (<a name="xiv.i-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#010">Ga 2:10</a><a name="xiv.i-p19.1"></A>,) and he had promised to concern himself in reference to it, and he had already done so in part, as we have seen in the former Epistle.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_658"></A><A HREF="#fn_658"><FONT SIZE="1">659</FONT></A>
 			 Now, however, he presses them still farther.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p21"></A><b>1. </b><i>I make known to you.</i> He commends the Macedonians, but it is with the design of stimulating the Corinthians by their example, although he does not expressly say so; for the former had no need of commendation, but the latter had need of a stimulus. And that he may stir up the Corinthians the more to emulation, 			 he ascribes it to the<i> grace of God</i> that the Macedonians had been so forward to give help to their brethren. For although it is acknowledged by all, that it is a commendable virtue to give help to the needy, they, nevertheless, do not reckon it to be a gain, nor do they look upon it as the <i>grace of God</i> Nay rather, they reckon, that it is so 			 much of what was theirs taken from them, and lost. Paul, on the other hand, declares, that we ought to ascribe it to the grace of God, when we afford aid to our brethren, and that it ought to be desired by us as a privilege of no ordinary kind.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p22"></A>He makes mention, however, of a twofold favor, that had been conferred upon the Macedonians. The <i>first </i>is, that they had endured afflictions with composure and cheerfulness. The <i>second </i>is, that from their slender means, equally as though they had possessed abundance,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_659"></A><A HREF="#fn_659"><FONT SIZE="1">660</FONT></A>
 			 they had taken something &#8212; to be laid out upon their brethren. Each of these things, Paul affirms with good reason, is a work of the Lord, for all quickly fail, that are not upheld by the Spirit of God, who is the Author of all consolation, and distrust clings to us, deeply rooted, which keeps us back from all offices of love, until it is subdued by the grace of the same Spirit.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.i-p24"></A><a name="xiv.i-p24.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p25"></A><b>2. </b><i>In much trial</i> &#8212; In other words, while they were tried with adversity, they, nevertheless, did not cease to rejoice in the Lord: nay, this disposition rose so high, as to swallow up sorrow; for the minds of the Macedonians, which must otherwise have been straitened, required to be set free from their restraints, that they might 			 liberally   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_660"></A><A HREF="#fn_660"><FONT SIZE="1">661</FONT></A>
 			  furnish aid to the brethren.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p27"></A>By the term <i>joy</i> he means that spiritual consolation by which believers are sustained under their afflictions; for the wicked either delude themselves with empty consolations, by avoiding a perception of the evil, and drawing off the mind to rambling thoughts, or else they wholly give way to grief, and allow themselves to be overwhelmed with it. 			 Believers, on the other hand, seek occasions of <i>joy</i> in the affliction itself, as we see in the 8th chapter of the Romans.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_661"></A><A HREF="#fn_661"><FONT SIZE="1">662</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p29"></A><i>And their deep poverty.</i> Here we have a metaphor taken from exhausted vessels, as though he had said, that the Macedonians had been emptied, so that they had now reached the bottom. He says, that even in such straits they had abounded in liberality, and had been rich, so as to have enough &#8212; not merely for their own use, but also for giving assistance to others. Mark the way, in which we shall always be liberal 			 even in the most straitened poverty &#8212; if by liberality of mind we make up for what is deficient in our coffers.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p30"></A><i>Liberality</i> is opposed to niggardliness, as in <a name="xiv.i-p30.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008">Ro 12:8</a><a name="xiv.i-p30.1"></A>, where Paul requires this on the part of deacons. For what makes us more close-handed than we ought to be is &#8212; when we look too carefully, and too far forward, in contemplating the dangers that may occur &#8212; when we are excessively cautious and careful &#8212; when we calculate 			 too narrowly what we will require during our whole life, or, in fine, how much we lose when the smallest portion is taken away. The man, that depends upon the blessing of the Lord, has his mind set free from these trammels, and has, at the same time, his hands opened for beneficence. Let us now draw an argument from the less to the greater. &#8220;Slender means, nay poverty, did not prevent the Macedonians from doing good to their brethren: What excuse, then, will the Corinthians have, if they keep 			 back, while opulent and affluent in comparison of them?&#8221;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.i-p31"></A><a name="xiv.i-p31.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p32"></A><b>3. </b><i>To their power, and even beyond their power.</i> When he says that they were <i>willing of themselves, </i>he means that they were, of their own accord, so well prepared for the duty, that they needed no exhortation. It was a great thing &#8212; to strive up to 			 the measure of their ability; and hence, to exert themselves <i>beyond</i> their ability, showed a rare, and truly admirable excellence.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_662"></A><A HREF="#fn_662"><FONT SIZE="1">663</FONT></A>
 			  Now he speaks according to the common custom of men, for the common rule of doing good is that which Solomon prescribes, (<a name="xiv.i-p33.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015">Pr 5:15</a><a name="xiv.i-p33.1"></A>) &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE44"><a name="xiv.i-p34"></A>to drink water out of our own fountains, and let the rivulets go past, that they may flow onwards to others.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_663"></A><A HREF="#fn_663"><FONT SIZE="1">664</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p36"></A>The Macedonians, on the other hand, making no account of themselves, and almost losing sight of themselves, concerned themselves rather as to providing for others.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_664"></A><A HREF="#fn_664"><FONT SIZE="1">665</FONT></A>
 			 In fine, those that are in straitened circumstances are willing beyond their ability, if they lay out any thing upon others from their slender means.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.i-p38"></A><a name="xiv.i-p38.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p39"></A><b>4.</b> <i>Beseeching us with much entreaty. </i>He enlarges upon their promptitude, inasmuch as they did not only not wait for any one to admonish them, but even <i>besought </i>those, by whom they would have been admonished, had they not anticipated the desires of all by their 			 activity.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_665"></A><A HREF="#fn_665"><FONT SIZE="1">666</FONT></A>
 			  We must again repeat the comparison formerly made between the less and the greater. &#8220;If the Macedonians, without needing to be besought, press forward of their own accord, nay more, anticipate others by using entreaties, how shameful a thing is it for the Corinthians to be inactive, more especially after being admonished! If the Macedonians lead the way before all, how shameful a thing is it for the Corinthians not, at least, to imitate their example! But what are 			 we to think, when, not satisfied with <i>beseeching, </i>they added to their requests <i>earnest entreaty, </i>and much of it too?&#8221; Now from this it appears, that they had <i>besought, </i>not as a mere form, but in good earnest.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p41"></A><i>That the favor and the fellowship.</i> The term<i> favor </i>he has made use of, for the purpose of recommending alms, though at the same time the word may be explained in different ways. This interpretation, however, appears to me to be the more simple one; because, as our heavenly Father freely 			 bestows upon us all things, so we ought to be imitators of his unmerited kindness in doing good, (<a name="xiv.i-p41.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045">Mt 5:45</a><a name="xiv.i-p41.1"></A>); or at least, because, in laying out our resources, we are simply the dispensers of his <i>favor. </i>The <i>fellowship of this ministry</i> consisted in his being a 			 helper to the Macedonians in this <i>ministry. </i>They contributed of their own, that it might be <i>administered </i>to the saints. They wished, that Paul would take the charge of collecting it.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.i-p42"></A><a name="xiv.i-p42.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p43"></A><b>5.</b> <i>And not as</i> He expected from them an ordinary degree of willingness, such as any Christian should manifest; but they went beyond his expectation, inasmuch as they not only had their worldly substance in readiness, but were prepared to devote even <i>themselves. They gave 			 themselves, </i>says he, <i>first to God, then to us.</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p44"></A>It may be asked, whether their giving themselves to God, and to Paul, were two different things. It is quite a common thing, that when God charges or commands through means of any one, he associates the person whom he employs as his minister, both in authority to enjoin, and in the obedience that is rendered.</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xiv.i-p45"></A>It seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p46"></A>say the Apostles, (<a name="xiv.i-p46.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028">Ac 15:28</a><a name="xiv.i-p46.1"></A>,) while at the same time they merely, as instruments, declared what had been revealed and enjoined by the Spirit. Again,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xiv.i-p47"></A>The people believed the Lord and his servant Moses,<br> 			 (<a name="xiv.i-p47.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031">Ex 14:31</a><a name="xiv.i-p47.2"></A>,)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p48"></A>while at the same time Moses had nothing apart from God. This, too, is what is meant by the clause that follows &#8212; <i>by the will of God</i> For, as they were obedient to God, who had committed themselves to his ministry, to be regulated by his counsel, they were influenced by this consideration in listening to Paul, as speaking from God&#8217;s mouth.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.i-p49"></A><a name="xiv.i-p49.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p50"></A><b>6.</b> <i>That we should exhort Titus. </i>Now this is an exhortation that is of greater force, when they learn that they are expressly summoned to duty.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_666"></A><A HREF="#fn_666"><FONT SIZE="1">667</FONT></A>
 			  Nor was it offensive to the Macedonians, that he was desirous to have the Corinthians as partners in beneficence. In the mean time an apology is made for Titus, that the Corinthians may not think that he pressed too hard upon them, as if he had not confidence in their good disposition. For he did that, from having been entreated, and it was rather in the name of the Macedonians, than in his own.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.i-p52"></A><a name="xiv.i-p52.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p53"></A><b>7.</b> <i>But as</i> He had already been very careful to avoid giving offense, inasmuch as he said, that Titus had entreated them, not so much from his own inclination, as in consideration of the charge given him by the Macedonians. Now, however, he goes a step farther, by admonishing them, that they must not even wait for the message 			 of the Macedonians being communicated to them; and that too, by commending their other virtues. &#8220;You ought not merely to associate yourselves as partners with the Macedonians, who require that; but surpass them in this respect, too, as you do in others.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p54"></A>He makes a distinction between<i> utterance</i> and <i>faith, </i>because it. is impossible that any one should have <i>faith, </i>and that, too, in an eminent degree, without being at the 			 same time much exercised in the word of God. <i>Knowledge</i> I understand to mean, <i>practice </i>and <i>skill, </i>or <i>prudence. </i>He makes mention of their <i>love</i> to himself, 			 that he may encourage them also from regard to himself personally, and in the mean time he gives up, with a view to the public advantage of the brethren, the personal affection with which they regarded him.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_667"></A><A HREF="#fn_667"><FONT SIZE="1">668</FONT></A>
 			  Now in this way he lays a restraint upon himself in everything, that he may not seem to accuse them when exhorting them.</p>  <a name="xiv.ii"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption10"><a name="xiv.ii-p1"></A><a name="xiv.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#008">2 Corinthians 8:8-12</a><a name="xiv.ii-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p2"></A><b>8.</b> I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p3"></A><b>8.</b> Non secundum imperium loquor, sed per aliorum sollicitudinem, et vestrae dilectionis sinceritatem approbans.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p4"></A><b>9.</b> For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p5"></A><b>9.</b> Nostis enim gratiam Domini nostri Iesu Christi, quod propter vos pauper factus sit, quum esset dives: ut vos illius paupertate ditesceretis.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p6"></A><b>10. </b>And herein I give <i>my</i> advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p7"></A><b>10.</b> Et consilium in hoc do: nam hoc vobis conducit: qui quidem non solum facere, verum etiam velle coepistis anno superiore.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p8"></A><b>11.</b> Now therefore perform the doing <i>of it</i>; that as <i>there was </i>a readiness to will, so <i>there may be </i>a performance also out of that which ye have.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p9"></A><b>11.</b> Nunc autem etiam illud quod facere coepistis, perficite: ut quemadmodum voluntas prompta fuit, ita et perficiatis ex eo quod suppetit.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p10"></A><b>12.</b> For if there be first a willing mind, <i>it is </i>accepted according to that a man hath, <i>and</i> not according to that he hath not.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p11"></A><b>12.</b> Etenim si iam adest animi promptitudo, ea iuxta id quod quisque possidet, accepta est: non iuxta id quod non possidet.</p>

<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.ii-p13"></A><a name="xiv.ii-p13.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p14"></A><b>8.</b> <i>I speak not according to commandment</i> Again he qualifies his exhortation, by declaring that he did not at all intend to compel them, as if he were imposing any necessity upon them, for that is to <i>speak according to commandment, </i>when we enjoin any thing definite, and 			 peremptorily require that it shall be done. Should any one ask &#8212; &#8220;Was it not lawful for him to prescribe what he had by commandment of the Lord?&#8221; The answer is easy &#8212; that God, it is true, everywhere charges us to help the necessities of our brethren, but he nowhere specifies the sum;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_668"></A><A HREF="#fn_668"><FONT SIZE="1">669</FONT></A>
 			  that, after making a calculation, we might divide between ourselves and the poor. He nowhere binds us to circumstances of times, or persons, but calls us to take the rule of love as our guide.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p16"></A>At the same time, Paul does not here look to what is lawful for him, or unlawful, but says, that he does not <i>command </i>as if he reckoned that they required to be constrained by <i>command </i>and requirement, as though they refused to do their duty, unless shut up to it by necessity. He assigns, on the other hand, two reasons why he, notwithstanding, stirs them up to duty: <i>first, </i>Because the concern felt by him for the saints 			 compels him to do so; and, <i>secondly, </i>Because he is desirous, that the love of the Corinthians should be made known to all. For I do not understand Paul to have been desirous to be assured of their love, (as to which he had already declared himself to be perfectly persuaded,)  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_669"></A><A HREF="#fn_669"><FONT SIZE="1">670</FONT></A>
 			 but he rather wished that all should have evidence of it. At the same time, the first clause in reference to the anxiety of others, admits of two meanings &#8212; either that he felt an anxiety as to the individuals, which did not allow him to be inactive, or that, yielding to the entreaties of others, who had the matter at heart, he spoke not so much from his own feeling, as at the suggestion of others.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.ii-p18"></A><a name="xiv.ii-p18.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p19"></A><b>9.</b> <i>For ye know the grace.</i> Having made mention of love, he adduces Christ as an all perfect and singular pattern of it. &#8220;Though he was rich,&#8221; says he, &#8220;he resigned the possession of all blessings, that he might enrich us by 			 his poverty.&#8221; He does not afterwards state for what purpose he makes mention of this, but leaves it to be considered by them; for no one can but perceive, that we are by this example stirred up to <i>beneficence, </i>that we may not spare ourselves, when help is to be afforded to our brethren.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p20"></A>Christ <i>was rich, </i>because he was God, under whose power and authority all things are; and farther, even in our human nature, which he put on, as the Apostle bears witness, (<a name="xiv.ii-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002">Heb 1:2</a><a name="xiv.ii-p20.1"></A>; <a name="xiv.ii-p20.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#008">Heb 2:8</a><a name="xiv.ii-p20.2"></A>,) he was the <i>heir of all things, </i>inasmuch 			 as he was placed by his Father over all creatures, and all things were placed under his feet. He nevertheless <i>became poor, </i>because he refrained from possessing, and thus he gave up his right for a time. We see, what destitution and penury as to all things awaited him immediately on his coming from his mother&#8217;s womb. We hear what he says himself, (<a name="xiv.ii-p20.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#058">Lu 9:58</a><a name="xiv.ii-p20.3"></A>,)</p>

<p><a name="xiv.ii-p22"></A>Hence he has consecrated poverty in his own person, that believers may no longer regard it with horror.

<p><a name="xiv.ii-p35"></A>When he adds &#8212; <i>from what you have,</i> he anticipates an objection; for the flesh is always ingenious in finding out subterfuges. Some plead that they have families, which it were inhuman to neglect; others, on the ground that they cannot give much, make use of this as a pretext for entire exemption. Could I give 			 so small a sum? All excuses of this nature Paul removes, when he commands every one to contribute according to the measure of his ability. He adds, also, the reason: that God looks to the heart &#8212; not to what is given, for when he says, that readiness of mind is acceptable to God, according to the individual&#8217;s ability, his meaning is this &#8212; &#8220;If from slender resources you present some small sum, your disposition is not less esteemed in the sight 			 of God, than in the case of a rich man&#8217;s giving a large sum <i>from his abundance. </i>(<a name="xiv.ii-p35.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#044">Mr 12:44</a><a name="xiv.ii-p35.1"></A>.)

True, indeed, it is certain, that we owe 			 to God, not merely a part, but all that we are, and all that we have, but in His kindness He spares us thus far, that He is satisfied with that participation of which the Apostle here speaks, What he teaches here you must understand to mean an abatement from the rigor of law.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_672"></A><A HREF="#fn_672"><FONT SIZE="1">673</FONT></A>

 			  and moderation, in stating that our alms are well-pleasing to God, when we relieve the necessity of our brethren from our abundance &#8212; not in such a way that they are at ease, and we are in want, but so that we may, from what belongs to us, distribute, so far as our resources allow, and that with a cheerful mind.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_675"></A><A HREF="#fn_675"><FONT SIZE="1">676</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xiv.iii-p20"></A><i>By an equality</i> <i>Equality</i> may be taken in two senses, either as meaning a mutual compensation, when like is given for like, or, as meaning a proper adjustment. I understand <a name="xiv.iii-p20.2"></A>&#7984;&#963;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#945; simply as meaning 			 &#8212; an <i>equality of proportional right,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_676"></A><A HREF="#fn_676"><FONT SIZE="1">677</FONT></A>
 			  as Aristotle terms it.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_677"></A><A HREF="#fn_677"><FONT SIZE="1">678</FONT></A>
 			  In this signification it is made use of, also, in <a name="xiv.iii-p22.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001">Col 4:1</a><a name="xiv.iii-p22.4"></A>, where he exhorts &#8220;masters to give to their servants what is <i>equal.</i>&#8221; He certainly does not mean, that they should be equal in condition and 			 station, but by this term he expresses that humanity and clemency, and kind treatment, which masters, in their turn, owe to their servants. Thus the Lord recommends to us a proportion of this nature, that we may, in so far as every one&#8217;s resources admit, afford help to the indigent, that there may not be some in affluence, and others in indigence. Hence he adds &#8212; at <i>the present time. </i>At that time, indeed, necessity pressed upon them. Hence we 			 are admonished that, in exercising beneficence, we must provide for the present necessity, if we would observe the true rule of equity.</p>

<p><a name="xiv.iii-p24"></A><b>14.</b> <i>And their abundance</i> It is uncertain, what sort of <i>abundance</i> he means. Some interpret it as meaning, that this had been the case, inasmuch as the Gospel had flowed out to them from the Church at Jerusalem, from which source they had, in their 			 penury, been assisted by their spiritual riches. This, I think, is foreign to Paul&#8217;s intention. It ought rather, in my opinion, to be applied to the communion of saints, which means, that whatever duty is discharged to one member, redounds to the advantage of the entire body. &#8220;If it is irksome to you to help your brethren with riches that are of no value, consider how many blessings you are destitute of, and these too, far more precious, with 			 which you may be enriched by those who are poor as to worldly substance. This participation, which Christ has established among the members of his body, should animate you to be more forward, and more active in doing good.&#8221; The meaning may, also, be this. &#8220;You now relieve them according to the necessity of the occasion, but they will have an opportunity given them at another time of requiting you.&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_678"></A><A HREF="#fn_678"><FONT SIZE="1">679</FONT></A>
 			  I approve rather of the other sentiment, which is of a more general nature, and with this accords what he again repeats in reference to equality. For the system of proportional right in the Church is this &#8212; that while they communicate to each other mutually according to the measure of gifts and of necessity, this mutual contribution produces a befitting symmetry, though some have more, and some less, and gifts are distributed unequally. 			   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_679"></A><A HREF="#fn_679"><FONT SIZE="1">680</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xiv.iii-p28"></A><b>15.</b> <i>As it is written.</i> The passage, that Paul quotes, refers to the manna, but let us hear what the Lord says by Moses. He would have this to serve as a never-failing proof, that men do not live by bread alone, but are Divinely supported, by the secret influence of <i>His </i>will, 			 who maintains and preserves all things that he has created. Again, in another passage, (<a name="xiv.iii-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003">De 8:3</a><a name="xiv.iii-p28.1"></A>,) Moses admonishes them, that they had been nourished for a time with such food, that they might learn that men are supported &#8212; not by their own industry or labor, but by the blessing of God. Hence it appears, that in the manna, as in a mirror, there is presented to us an emblem of 			 the ordinary food that we partake of. Let us now come to the passage that Paul quotes. When the manna had fallen, they were commanded to gather it in heaps, so far as every one could, though at the same time, as some are more active than others, there was more gathered by some than was necessary for daily use,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_680"></A><A HREF="#fn_680"><FONT SIZE="1">681</FONT></A>
 			  yet no one took for his own private use more than an homer,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_681"></A><A HREF="#fn_681"><FONT SIZE="1">682</FONT></A>
 			  for that was the measure that was prescribed by the Lord. This being the case, all had as much as was sufficient, and no one was in want. This we have in <a name="xiv.iii-p30.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#018">Ex 16:18</a><a name="xiv.iii-p30.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.iii-p31"></A>Let us now apply the history to Paul&#8217;s object. The Lord has not prescribed to us an homer, or any other measure, according to which the food of each day is to be regulated, but he has enjoined upon us frugality and temperance, and has forbidden, that any one should go to excess, taking advantage of his abundance. Let those, then, that have riches, whether they have been left by inheritance, or procured by industry and efforts, consider that 			 their abundance was not intended to be laid out in intemperance or excess, but in relieving the necessities of the brethren. For whatever we have is <i>manna, </i>from whatever quarter it comes, provided it be really <i>ours, </i>inasmuch as riches acquired by fraud, and unlawful artifices, are unworthy to be called so, but are rather <i>quails </i>sent forth by the anger of God. (<a name="xiv.iii-p31.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#031">Nu 11:31</a><a name="xiv.iii-p31.1"></A>.) And as in 			 the case of one hoarding the manna, either from excessive greed or from distrust, what was laid up immediately putrified, so we need not doubt that the riches, that are heaped up at the expense of our brethren, are accursed, and will soon perish, and that too, in connection with the ruin of the owner; so that we are not to think that it is the way to increase, if, consulting our own advantage for a long while to come, we defraud our poor brethren of the beneficence that we owe them.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_682"></A><A HREF="#fn_682"><FONT SIZE="1">683</FONT></A>
 			 I acknowledge, indeed, that there is not enjoined upon us an equality of such a kind, as to make it unlawful for the rich to live in any degree of greater elegance than the poor; but an equality is to be observed thus far &#8212; that no one is to be allowed to starve, and no one is to hoard his abundance at the expense of defrauding others. The poor man&#8217;s <i>homer</i>  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_683"></A><A HREF="#fn_683"><FONT SIZE="1">684</FONT></A>
 			  will be coarse food and a spare diet; the rich man&#8217;s <i>homer </i>will be a more abundant portion, it is true, according to his circumstances, but at the same time in such a way that they live temperately, and are not wanting to others.</p>

And, in the first place, he names Titus, who, he says, had been divinely raised up. This was of great importance in the 			 case. For his embassy would be so much the more successful, if the Corinthians recognized him as having come to them, from having been stirred up to it by God.

 			  and farther, that this is an evidence of God&#8217;s concern for his people, that he raises up ministers and guardians, to make it their endeavor to relieve their necessities. But if the providence of God shows itself in this manner, in providing the means of nourishment for the body, how much greater care will he exercise as to the means of spiritual nourishment, that his people may not be in want of them!

 			 <i> that no one</i> Lest any one should think, that the Churches had an unfavorable opinion of Paul, as if it had been from distrusting his integrity that they had associated partners with him, as persons that are suspected are wont to have guards set over them, he declares that he had been the adviser of this measure, with the view of providing against calumnies. Here 			 some one will ask, &#8220;Would any one have been so impudent, as to venture to defame with even the slightest suspicion the man, whose fidelity must have been, in all quarters, beyond every surmise?&#8221; I answer, Who is there that will be exempt from Satan&#8217;s bite, when even Christ himself was not spared by them? Behold, Christ is exposed to the reproaches   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_694"></A><A HREF="#fn_694"><FONT SIZE="1">695</FONT></A>
 			  of the wicked, and shall his servants be in safety? (<a name="xiv.iv-p31.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#025">Mt 10:25</a><a name="xiv.iv-p31.2"></A>.) Nay rather, the more upright a person is, in that proportion does Satan assail him by every kind of contrivance, if he can by any means shake his credit, for there would arise from this a much greater occasion of stumbling.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_695"></A><A HREF="#fn_695"><FONT SIZE="1">696</FONT></A>
 			  Hence the higher the station in which we are placed, we must so much the more carefully imitate Paul&#8217;s circumspection and modesty. He was not so lifted up, as not to be under control equally with any individual of the flock.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_696"></A><A HREF="#fn_696"><FONT SIZE="1">697</FONT></A>
 			  He was not so self-complacent, as to think it beneath his station to provide against calumnies. Hence he prudently shunned dangers, and used great care not to furnish any wicked person with a handle against him. And, certainly, nothing is more apt to give rise to unfavorable surmises, than the management of public money.</p>

<p><a name="xiv.iv-p35"></A><b>21.</b> <i>Providing things honest</i> I am of opinion, that there were not wanting, even among the Corinthians, some who would have proceeded so far as to revile, if occasion had been allowed them. Hence he wished them to know the state of matters, that he might shut the mouths of all everywhere. Accordingly he declares, that he is not merely concerned to have a good conscience in the sight of God, but also to have a good character among men. At the same time, there can be no doubt, that he designed to instruct the Corinthians, as well as all others, by his example, that, in doing what is right, the opinion of men is not to be disregarded. The first thing,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_697"></A><A HREF="#fn_697"><FONT SIZE="1">698</FONT></A>
 			  it is true, is that the person take care, that he be a good man. This is secured, not by mere outward actions, but by an upright conscience. The next thing is, that the persons, with whom you are conversant, recognize you as such.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.iv-p37"></A>Here, however, the object in view must be looked to. Nothing, assuredly, is worse than ambition, which vitiates the best things in the world, disfigures, I say, the most graceful, and makes sacrifices of the sweetest smell have an offensive odor before the Lord. Hence this passage is slippery, so that care must be taken  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_698"></A><A HREF="#fn_698"><FONT SIZE="1">699</FONT></A>
 			 lest one should pretend to be desirous, in common with Paul, of a good reputation, and yet be very far from having Paul&#8217;s disposition, for he <i>provided things honest in the sight of men, </i>that no one might be stumbled by his example, but that, on the contrary, all might be edified. Hence we must, if we would desire to be like him, take care that we be not on our own account desirous of a good name. &#8220;He that is regardless of fame,&#8221; says Augustine, &#8220;is cruel, because it is not less 			 necessary before our neighbor, than a good conscience is before God.&#8221; This is true, provided you consult the welfare of your brethren with a view to the glory of God, and in the mean time are prepared to bear reproaches and ignominy in place of commendation, if the Lord should see it meet. Let a Christian man, however, always take care to frame his life with a view to the edification of his neighbors, and diligently take heed, that the ministers of Satan shall have no pretext for reviling, to 			 the dishonor of God and the offense of the good.</p>

Others, however, suppose that the whole quantity gathered by any one family was first put into a common mass, and then measured out to the several individuals composing the <i>household.</i>&#8221; &#8212; <i>Bush&#8217;s Notes on Exodus.</i> &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>
