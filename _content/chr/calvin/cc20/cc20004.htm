<p><a name="v.i-p2"></A><b>1</b>. Moreover, the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,</p> 				   				
<p><a name="v.i-p3"></A><b>1</b>. Et fuit sermo Jehovae ad Jeremiam secundo, cum ipse adhuc captivus esset in atrio custodiae, dicendo,</p>

<p><a name="v.i-p8"></A><b>4</b>. For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;</p>

<p><a name="v.i-p14"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.i-p15"></A><a name="v.i-p15.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p16"></A>This prophecy refers to the same subject; nor was it to be wondered at, that God spoke so much of the same thing, for it was necessary to render the Jews inexcusable, as they always pretended ignorance, except God made frequent repetitions. And this was also the reason why Paul said, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses everything should be established, when he said that he would come the second and the third time to Corinth. (<a name="v.i-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001">2Co 13:1</a><a name="v.i-p16.1"></A>) He intimated that his coming would not be useless, for except they repented they could not have escaped by pretending ignorance, as hypocrites are wont to do. It was, then, God&#8217;s purpose to confirm by many prophecies what he had once testified respecting the restoration of the people; but he had an especial care for the faithful, that they might not grow faint and succumb under those many 			 trials which remained for so long a time; for as some died in exile, they might have forgotten the covenant of God, and thus the soul might have perished with the body. And those who were to return to their own country had need of no common support, so that they might continue firm for seventy years, and rely with confidence on God&#8217;s mercy. We now, then, understand why God repeated the doctrine as to the return of the people.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p17"></A>It is said that the <i>word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah </i>while he was yet in <i>prison</i> Then the Prophet was bidden to consult the benefit of his enemies, and to promote their welfare, however unworthy they were through their 			 ingratitude; for though they had not all demanded his death, yet the greater part of them had clamorously condemned him, and he had been with difficulty delivered, and was now lying in prison. It was a great cruelty that the people, while he was faithfully discharging his prophetic office, should thus furiously rage against him. He is, however, bidden still to proceed in the duties of his office, to comfort them, to ease their grief, and to afford them some alleviation in their evils and 			 miseries.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p18"></A>There is also no doubt but that it was profitable to Jeremiah himself; for it was a most iniquitous reward, that he should, while serving God faithfully and conscientiously, be cast ignominiously into prison, and be there kept a captive so long. It was, then, some mitigation of his grief, that God appeared to him in that very prison; it was an evidence that God esteemed him higher than all the Jews. God did not then speak in the Temple, nor 			 throughout the whole city. The prison then was God&#8217;s sanctuary, and there he gave responses to his Prophet, though he was wont to do this before from the mercy-seat, from the ark of the covenant. We hence see how great was the honor that God was pleased at that time to bestow in a manner on a prison, when he had forsaken his own Temple.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p19"></A>Now follows the prophecy, the substance of which is, that though the city was to be given up into the hand of the king of Babylon, yet that calamity was not to be perpetual, for God at length, after the completion of seventy years, would restore it. But why this promise was given has been stated already: it was given that the faithful might submit patiently to God, and suffer themselves with calm minds to be chastised, and also recumb on the 			 hope the promise gave them, and thus feel assured, that as they were smitten by God&#8217;s hand, their punishment would prove their medicine and an aid to their salvation. Now, then, we perceive what this prophecy is, and also for what purpose it was delivered.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.i-p20"></A><a name="v.i-p20.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p21"></A>But before God promised anything respecting the return of the people, he strengthened the mind of the Prophet by a preface, and also encouraged and animated the godly to entertain good hope. The preface is, that God created and <i>formed Jerusalem</i> There was, then, no doubt but he would at length rescue it from the 			 hands of enemies; nay, that he would raise it up even from hell itself. To prove this, he says that he is <i>Jehovah</i> We hence see why the Prophet, before he recited the promise, honored God with magnificent titles. But it is doubtful whether the past or the present time is to be understood, when it is said, <i>Jehovah the maker of it, 			 Jehovah the former of it; </i>for either would be suitable, &#8212; that is, that God at the beginning built Jerusalem and was its founder, or that he had purposed again to create and form it anew. If the past time be taken, then the meaning is, that the city, which had been built by God, could not possibly perish, because his will was that it should remain perpetually. And the same sentiment often occurs in the Prophets, and also in the 			 Psalms. For it was God&#8217;s design to be regarded as the founder of Jerusalem, in order that he might distinguish it from all other cities of the world. We know that there is nothing under the sun perpetual, for the whole world is subject to various changes; nay,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.i-p22"></A>&#8220;the fashion of this world,&#8221; as Paul says, &#8220;passeth away.&#8221; <br> 			 (<a name="v.i-p22.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031">1Co 7:31</a><a name="v.i-p22.2"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p23"></A>As, then, changes so various take place in all cities, God, by a singular privilege, exempted Jerusalem from this common lot; and hence the Prophet truly and wisely concludes, that the ruin of the city would not be perpetual, because God had formed it. And hence its future restitution is sufficiently proved.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p24"></A>But if any one prefers the present time, then the meaning would be, that he who had resolved to create and form Jerusalem is <i>Jehovah, </i>the God of hosts: no one then can hinder his work. As this sense is not unsuitable, I do not reject it, though I follow the former. We must, at the same time, bear in mind this principle, &#8212; that restoration is promised to the Jews, because Jerusalem had been, as it were, chosen by God, so that he took it 			 under his care and protection, so as to preserve it perpetually. Whether then we take the words to be in the past or present time, that God is the creator and former of Jerusalem, we see that the promise of deliverance is founded on the mercy of God, even because he had cliosen Jerusalem for his own habitation, according to what is in the Psalms,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.i-p25"></A>&#8220;His foundations are on the holy mountains.&#8221; (<a name="v.i-p25.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001">Ps 87:1</a><a name="v.i-p25.1"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p26"></A>And there, also, the pronoun is used instead of God&#8217;s name, as here instead of the city&#8217;s name, <i>Thus saith Jehovah, who has created it, who has formed it, that he might establish it</i> Here Jerusalem is not named; but the narrative is much more emphatical than if it was expressed, as also in the place we have just 			 quoted, the word God is not given, nor the word Church, if I mistake not, in the 37th chapter of Isaiah (<a name="v.i-p26.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#000">Isa 37</a><a name="v.i-p26.1"></A>). When the Prophet says,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.i-p27"></A>&#8220;His foundations are on the holy mountains,&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p28"></A>there is no doubt but that the word God is to be understood, though not expressed. So here, when speaking of the city, he says that Jehovah <i>formed it, </i>or will form it.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">86</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p32"></A>He adds, <i>Jehovah is his name</i> Here he exalts the power of God, that the Jews might not set up against him what otherwise might have terrified them, and, as it were, reduced them to a lifeless state, and caused them wholly to faint away. He, therefore, sets before their eyes the power of God, as though he had said, 			 that there would be no obstacle which could delay God&#8217;s work, for he had resolved to form and create anew his own city after its demolition; it is, in a word, the same as though he had bidden the people to turn their eyes and all their thoughts to God, to consider his immeasurable power, and so to entertain hope, and thus to look down, as it were, from on high on all the impediments which might have otherwise wholly weakened their confidence.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.i-p33"></A><a name="v.i-p33.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p34"></A>He afterwards adds, <i>Cry to me, and I will answer thee, and I will announce to thee things magnificent and recondite, which thou hast not known</i> It was not so much for the sake of the Prophet as of others that this was said. For the Prophet, no doubt, had earnestly prayed, and his prison must have inflamed his ardor, 			 so as to intercede constantly with God. God then does not here reprove his torpor or his sloth by saying, <i>Cry to me; </i>but as I have said, the word is so directed to the Prophet, that God excites all the godly to pray. There is indeed here an implied reproof, as though he had said that it was their fault that God did not cheer their minds with a joyful and happy message, for they had 			 closed the door against themselves, so as to prevent God from offering them that comfort which they yet <i>especially </i>wished; but men, while they expect God to be propitious to them, do not yet give entrance to his grace, because they bolt up, as it were, their hearts with unbelief. We hence see why it was said, <i>Cry to me, and I will answer 			 thee</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p35"></A>But this passage ought especially to be noticed; for we may hence conclude, that whenever we pine away in sorrow, or are worn out by affliction, it is our own fault, because we are tardy and slow to pray: for every one who cries acknowledges that God is always nigh, as he promises in the Psalms, to those who truly call on him. That we are then sometimes worn out with long grief, and no comfort given to us, this happens, let us know, through our 			 neglect and sloth, because we cry not to God, who is ever ready to answer us, as he here promises.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p36"></A>And he says, <i>I will declare to thee great things, and of hidden things thou knowest not</i> So are the words literally; but they cannot be thus suitably rendered: then we may read, &#8220;and things hidden which thou knowest not,&#8221; or, &#8220;I will make thee acquainted with hidden things which are unknown to thee.&#8221; It may, however, 			 be asked, why God called those things hidden, of which Jeremiah had already prophesied? The answer is obvious, &#8212; that they had, as it were, made void all the promises of God, and the holy man might, have been even confounded, when he saw that God&#8217;s favor was thus rejected; for it was reasonable to conclude, that as the people obstinately rejected the hope of deliverance, it was all over with them, and that their condition was, as it were, hopeless. We hence see that those things are often 			 hidden to us which God has again and again made known to us; for either they do not immediately penetrate into our minds, or the memory of them is extinguished, or faith is not so vigorous in us as it ought to be, or we are disturbed and confounded by obstacles thrown in our way.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.i-p37"></A><a name="v.i-p37.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p38"></A>He now expresses what these hidden things were, <i>As to the houses, he says, (so it is literally) thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, as to the houses of this city, and as to the houses of the kings of Judah</i> The proposition; <a name="v.i-p38.1"></A>&#1506;&#1500;, upon, often means with regard to, concerning. He names the <i>houses </i>of the kings, for the kings of Judah were not satisfied, as it is well known, with one palace, but had many houses without the city. <i>As to the houses, </i>he says, <i>which 			 had been thrown down</i> This is variously explained; the houses, say some, had been pulled down for the warlike engines, that is, that these engines might be made from the materials, and for the sword. The sense, however, would appear more obvious were we to take this view, that the houses had been thrown down by the warlike engines, and also by the sword, that is, by the violence of the enemies. The word, <a name="v.i-p38.2"></A>&#1505;&#1500;&#1500;&#1514;<i> sallut, </i>as it has been already stated, is rendered by some fortifications; but when the storming of cities is spoken of, it means no doubt warlike machines, such as the engines to throw darts, or battering-rams: but we know not in what form they were made by the Jews and the Chaldeans.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.i-p39"></A><a name="v.i-p39.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p40"></A>There are two parts to this prophecy, &#8212; that the Jews were about to perish through their own fault, &#8212; and that they were to be restored through the favor and goodness of God alone. Here, then, in the first place, the Prophet condemns the false confidence of the people, who stoutly resisted the Chaldeans. <i>They 			 came, </i>he says, <i>to fight with the Chaldeans; </i>but what would be the issue of the battle? even to <i>fill, </i>he says, <i>with the carcases of men their very 			 houses</i> When he says that the Jews were <i>come, </i>he speaks of what had already, as it were, taken place. It is indeed a participle in the present tense, <i>coming; </i>but the Prophet here sets before their eyes what was to be, as though he had said, &#8220;The Jews will boldly rush forth, and will 			 think themselves equal, and even superior to the Chaldeans; thus they will arm themselves with courage for the battle.&#8221; Then he says this, in order to ridicule the audacity of the people. The sad issue of the fight follows, the filling of their own houses with the carcases of men. The copulative is redundant, or it must be taken as explanatory, and rendered, even. <i>They shall come </i>then <i>to fight, evern that they may fill their own houses with carcases, </i>and thus inflame the fury of their enemies.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">87</FONT></A>
 			  For it hence happened that the Chaldeans shed more blood, and spared not the mass of the people; because we know that when a city is won by force, more cruelty is exercised, and the slaughters become much greater. Had the Jews willingly surrendered, they would have received more humanity at the hand of their conquerors; but the Chaldeans became implacable, because their fury had been kindled by the pertinacity of the people fighting against them. God, at the same 			 time, shews that the Chaldeans would not be victorious through their own valor, but because he himself would <i>smite </i>or slay the Jews. Then he ascribes to his own vengeance the calamity which might have seemed to proceed from the Chaldeans; for Jeremiah could not have exhorted the people to repentance except he shewed that it happened through a righteous judgment, that the Chaldeans so cruelly raged against them. But we must defer the rest until 			 to-morrow.</p>  <a name="v.ii"></A>  		  
<p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld24"><a name="v.ii-p1"></A>PRAYER</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.ii-p2"></A>Grant, Almighty God, that we may so learn to humble ourselves under thy mighty hand, whenever thou chastisest us, that we may not faint in our miseries, but flee to thy mercy with more confidence, and by acknowledging our sins, may become so displeased with ourselves, that we may never lose the taste of thy mercy but gird ourselves up so as to entertain good hope, and call upon thee, until we shall at length find by success that our prayers are not 			 in vain; and may we ever thus find comfort in our evils, so that we may at length enjoy that perfect felicity, which thou hast prepared for us in heaven, through Christ our Lord. &#8212; Amen.</p>  <a name="v.iii"></A>  		  
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref27"><a name="v.iii-p1"></A>Lecture One Hundred and Thirty-Third</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.iii-p2"></A>I was compelled yesterday to stop at the second clause of the fifth verse, where God declares that the Jews were <i>slain </i>by him, while they were exerting all their strength to resist. He then says that that slaughter happened to the city and to the people, because they had sinned against him. But he says, first, I have <i>slain </i>them, 			 and then, <i>I have hid my face from this city, </i>and he also adds the reason, on <i>accorent of all their wickedness</i> Then he declares that he was the author of that slaughter, and he also shews that in just judgment he punished the wickedness of the people. For as they had 			 never ceased for a long time to provoke his vengeance, he here shews that they deserved that reward, even of having their city forcibly taken by the Chaldeans, and also of being everywhere slain, and of having their houses filled with dead bodies.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.iii-p3"></A><a name="v.iii-p3.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.iii-p4"></A>He afterwards says, <i>Behold, I will bring a renewal and a healing, and I will heal them</i> This is the main point, as they say, in the passage. He had been hitherto shewing, that the Jews had deserved so heavy a punishment, because by their obstinacy they had not ceased to provoke God against themselves. But he 			 promises here to be propitious to them after having moderately corrected them. For we have said, that the design of this prophecy was to sustain the Jews, so that they might not despond, but rely on the promise of favor, however bitter exile might be. Then he says, <i>I will bring a renewal, </i>or restoration, <i>and a 			 healing</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">88</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.iii-p6"></A>And it is added, <i>I will open to them abundance of peace and of truth</i> Some render the last word, <a name="v.iii-p6.1"></A>&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, <i>amet, </i>prayer; for the verb <a name="v.iii-p6.2"></A>&#1488;&#1502;&#1503;<i> amen, </i>means sometimes to pray and also to multiply. There may then be a twofold meaning; the first, that God would open to them an access to prayer; for things were so hopeless among the people, that no one dared to utter a word. Even Jeremiah himself was forbidden to pray, (<a name="v.iii-p6.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014">Jer 11:14</a><a name="v.iii-p6.3"></A>) because God had resolved to destroy those miserable men respecting whom there was no hope of repentance. Some therefore understand that an access to prayer is here promised, so that the faithful and the servants of God might pray for the prosperity of the city. But this explanation seems to me to be too far-fetched. I take, therefore, a simpler interpretation, &#8212; that God would give them abundance of peace, or rather the prolonging or continuance of peace. By peace is meant, as it 			 is well known, a happy state. Then to Jerusalem, reduced to extreme miseries, God promises joyful things, so that she should afterwards live prosperously; and he adds the word <i>truth, </i>which is to be taken here for stability,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">89</FONT></A>
 			  as, indeed, everywhere in Scripture, as though he had said, that the prosperous state of the city would notbe for a month, or a short time, but continual and even perpetual, as he declares in the next verse.</p>  <a name="v.iv"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption17"><a name="v.iv-p1"></A><a name="v.iv-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#007">Jeremiah 33:7</a><a name="v.iv-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="v.iv-p2"></A><b>7</b>. And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="v.iv-p3"></A><b>7</b>. Et reducam captivitatem Jehudah, et captivitatem Israel, et aedificabo cos sicuti a principio.</p>

<p class="Normal"><a name="v.iv-p5"></A><a name="v.iv-p5.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.iv-p6"></A>By the word <i>building, </i>God means that they would return to their own country for this end &#8212; that they might remain secure in it. And this promise was very needful, since the Jews were on every side surrounded by enemies; for all their neighbors had united together against them, and were most hostile, so that they never ceased to create new troubles. For this reason mention is made of <i>building, </i>as though the Prophet had said, that 			 the prosperity of the city would be lasting, for it would be so founded, that it would not fall or totter at any kind of assault.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.iv-p7"></A>But he promises deliverance, not only to the tribe of Judah, but also to the whole kingdom of Israel. Though very few returned, yet God offered the benefit which he had promised to all in common: and then, as it has been often said, this promise is to be extended to the coming of Christ. For God confined not his favor to those few years in which liberty was granted to the Jews, when they returned from their exile in Babylon; but included 			 the eternal salvation which remained for them, of whiclx the prelude was their return. Let us now proceed, &#8212;</p>  <a name="v.v"></A>

<p><a name="v.v-p6"></A>He says first, that he would <i>cleanse themfrom all iniquity, </i>and then, that he would be propitious to <i>all their iniquities</i> He no doubt repeats the same thing; but the words are not superfluous, for it was 			 necessary seriously to remind the Jews of their many vices, of which indeed they were conscious, and yet they did not repent. As then they perversely followed their own wills, it was needful for the Prophet to goad them sharply, so that they might know that they were exposed to eternal destruction, if God&#8217;s mercy, and that by no means common, came not to their aid. Here, then, he represents the greatness of their sins, that he might on the other hand extol the mercy of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.v-p7"></A>By the word <i>cleanse, </i>one might understand regeneration, and this may seem probable to those who are not well acquainted with the language of Scripture; but <a name="v.v-p7.1"></A>&#1496;&#1492;&#1512;, <i>theer, </i>means properly to expiate. This then does not refer to regeneration, but to forgiveness, hence I have said, that the Prophet mentions two things here in the same sense, &#8212; that God would <i>cleanse them from iniquity, </i>&#8212; and that he would <i>pardon all their 			 iniquities</i> We see now the reason why the Prophet used so many words in testifying that God would be so merciful to them as to forgive their sins, even because they, though loaded with many vices, yet extenuated their heinousness, as hypocrites always do. The favor of God, then, would never have been appreciated by the Jews had not the atrocity of their guilt been clearly made known to them. And this also was the reason why he said, 			 <i>I will pardon all their iniquities</i> He had said before, <i>I will cleanse them from all iniquity; </i>then he added, <i>I will pardon all their iniquities</i> For by this 			 change in the number the Prophet shews the mass and variety of their sins, as though he had said, that the heaps of evils were so multiplied, that there was need of no common mercy in God to receive them into favor.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.v-p8"></A>He says further, <i>By which they have sinned against me, and by which they have acted wickedly against me</i> These words confirm what I have already said, that the Jews were severely reproved by the Prophet, in order that they might first consider and reflect on what they deserved; and secondly, that they might extol the 			 favor of God according to its value.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.v-p9"></A>We must at the same time observe, that the Jews had their attention directed to the first and chief ground of confidence, so that they might have some hope of a restoration; for the origin of all God&#8217;s blessings, or the fountain from which all good things flow, is the favor of God in being reconciled to us. He may, indeed, supply us bountifully with whatever we may wish, while yet he himself is alienated from us, as we see to be the case with the 			 ungodly, who often abound in all good things; and hence they glory and boast as though they had God as it were, in a manner, bound to them. But whatever God grants and bestows on the ungodly, cannot, properly speaking, be deemed as an evidence of his favor and grace; but he thus renders them more unexcusable, while he treats them so indulgently. There is then no saving good, but what flows from the paternal love of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.v-p10"></A>We must now see how God becomes propitious to us. He becomes so, when he imputes not our sins to us. For except pardon goes before, he must necessarily be adverse to us; for as long as he looks on us as we are, he finds in us nothing but what deserves vengeance. We are therefore always accursed before God until he buries our sins. Hence I have said, that the first fountain of all the good things that are to be hoped for, is here briefly made 			 known to the Jews, even the gratuitous favor of God in reconciling them to himself. Let us then learn to direct all our thoughts to God&#8217;s mercy whenever we seek what seems necessary to us. For if we catch as it were at God&#8217;s blessings, and do not consider whence they proceed, we shall be caught by a bait: as the fish through their voracity strangle themselves, (for they snatch at the hook as though it were food) so also the ungodly, who with avidity seize on God&#8217;s blessings, and care not that 			 he should be propitious to them; they swallow them as it were to their own ruin. That all things then may tuae to our salvation, let us learn to make always a beginning with the paternal love of God, and let us know that the cause of that love is his immeasurable goodness, through which it comes that he reconciles us freely to himself by not imputing to us our sins.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.v-p11"></A>We may also gather another doctrine from this passage, &#8212; that if the grievousness of our sins terrifies us, yet all diffidence ought to be overcome, because God does not promise his mercy only to those sinners who have slightly fallen, either through ignorance or error, but even to such as have heaped sins on sins. There is therefore no reason why the greatness of our sins should overwhelm us; but we may ever venture to flee to the hope of 			 pardon, since we see that it is offered indiscriminately to all, even to those who had been extremely wicked before God, and had not only sinned, but had also become in a manner apostates, so that they ceased not in all ways to provoke God&#8217;s vengeance.

<p><a name="v.vi-p6"></A>Here God testifies that his favor would be such as to deserve praise in all the world, or, which is the same thing, that his bounty would be worthy of being remembered. Hence he says, that it would be to him for <i>a name among all nations; </i>but as he designed to extol the greatness of his glory, he adds, 			 <i>a praise and an honor, </i>or a glory; and it is emphatically added, <i>among all nations</i> And this passage shews to us that the Prophet did not speak only of the people&#8217;s return, and that this prophecy ought not to be confined to the state of the <i>city, 			 </i>such as it was before the coming of Christ; for though the favor of God was known among the Chaldeans and some other nations, it was not yet known through the whole world, for he says, <i>among all the nations of the earth; </i>and God no doubt included all parts of the world. We hence then conclude that the favor of which the Prophet speaks refers to the kingdom of 			 Christ, for God did not then attain a name to himself among all nations, but, as it is well known, only in some portions of the east. When, therefore, he says that the favor he would shew to his people, would be to him <i>a name, </i>he promises no doubt that deliverance which was at length brought by Christ.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.vi-p7"></A>And in the same sense must be taken what follows, <i>Because they shall hear, </i>etc.; for the relative <a name="v.vi-p7.1"></A>&#1488;&#1513;&#1512;<i> asher, </i>is here a causative, as the Prophet expresses here the way and manner in which 			 glory and honor would come to God on account of the deliverance of his people, even because the nations would hear of this; and this has been done by the preaching of the Gospel, because then only was God&#8217;s goodness towards the Jews everywhere made known, when the knowledge of the Law and of prophetic truth came to aliens who had previously heard nothing of the true doctrine of religion. We now then understand the design of the holy 			 Spirit.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.vi-p8"></A>Further, by these words God exhorts all to gratitude; for whenever the fountain of God&#8217;s blessings is pointed out to us, we ought not to be indifferent, but to be stimulated to give thanks to him. When therefore God declares that the redemption of his people would be <i>a name </i>to him <i>among all 			 nations, </i>he thus shews to the godly that they ought not to be torpid, but to proclaim his goodness. And at the same time it serves for a confirmation, when God intimates that he would be the Redeemer of his people, in order that he might acquire to himself a name, for there is to be understood a contrast, that in this kindness, he would not regard what the Jews deserved, but would seek for a cause in himself, as it is expressed more 			 fully elsewhere,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.vi-p9"></A>&#8220;Not on your account will I do this, O house of Israel,&#8221; (<a name="v.vi-p9.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022">Eze 36:22</a><a name="v.vi-p9.1"></A>)</p>

<p><a name="v.vi-p12"></A>We then see that God brings forward his own name, that the Jews might continue to entertain hope, however guilty they may have been, and own themselves worthy of eternal destruction.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.vi-p13"></A>If we read, &#8220;It shall be to me for a name of joy,&#8221; the sense would be, &#8220;for a name in which I delight.&#8221; If we read the words apart, &#8220;For a name and joy,&#8221; the sense would be still the same; nor ought it to be deemed unreasonable that God testifies that it would be to him for joy. For though he is not moved and influenced as we are, yet this mode of speaking is elsewhere adopted, as in 			 <a name="v.vi-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#031">Ps 104:31</a><a name="v.vi-p13.1"></A>,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.vi-p14"></A>&#8220;The Lord shall rejoice in his works.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.vi-p15"></A>God then is said to take delight in doing good, because he is in his nature inclined to goodness and mercy.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.vi-p16"></A>He afterwards adds, <i>they, shall fear and tremble for all the goodness, </i>etc. The word <a name="v.vi-p16.1"></A>&#1499;&#1500;<i> cal, </i>&#8220;all,&#8221; denotes greatness, and is to be taken emphatically. The words, however, may at first 			 sight appear singular, &#8220;they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness,&#8221; etc.; for it seems not reasonable that men should fear, when they acknowledge God&#8217;s goodness, for this, on the contrary, is a reason for joy and confidence. This clause is sometimes applied to the ungodly, for they have no taste for God&#8217;s favor so as to be cheered by it, but on the contrary they fret and gnash their teeth when God appears kind to his people; for they are vexed, when they see that they are excluded from 			 the enjoyment of those blessings, which are laid up, as it is said elsewhere, for them who fear God. But I have not the least doubt but the Prophet means the conversion of the Gentiles when he says, <i>they shall fear </i>and <i>tremble </i>for all <i>the 			 goodness, </i>etc.; as though he had said, that not only the name of God would be known among the nations, so that they would proclaim that he had been merciful to his people, but that it would at the same time be the effect and influence of his grace, that the nations would become obedient to God. Moreover, it is a usual thing to designate the worship and fear of God by the words fear, dread, and trembling. For though the faithful do 			 not dread the presence of God, but cheerfully present themselves to him whenever he invites them, and in full confidence call on him, there is yet no reason why they should not tremble when they think of his majesty. For these two things are connected together, even the fear and trembling which humble us before God, and the confidence which raises us up so as to dare familiarly to approach him. Here then is pointed out the conversion of the Gentiles; as though the Prophet had said, that the 			 favor of deliverance to the Church would not only avail for this end, to make the Gentiles to proclaim God&#8217;s goodness, but would also have the effect of bringing them under his authority, that they might reverence and fear him as the only true God. He again adds the word <i>peace, </i>but in the same sense as before: he mentions goodness, the cause of prosperity, and then he adds peace or prosperity as its effect. It afterwards follows, &#8212;</p>  <a name="v.vii"></A>

<p><a name="v.vii-p8"></A>These two verses are connected together, and have been improperly divided, for the sentence is not complete. In the first place we have, <i>Yet shall be heard, </i>but what? <i>the voice of joy, etc., </i>as we find 			 in the following verse. Jeremiah confirms at large what he had taught respecting the return of the people, because there was need of many and strong supports, that, the faithful might <i>proceed </i>in their course with <i>confidence</i> It was indeed difficult to muster courage under so great a calamity; 			 and had they for a short season breathing time, yet new trials constantly arising might have cast them down and laid them prostrate. There is no wonder then that the Prophet here speaks diffusely of that favor which was deemed incredible; and then the memory of it might not have always remained fixed in the hearts of the faithful, had not a repeated confirmation been given.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.vii-p9"></A>He again introduces God as the speaker, that the promise might have more effect. <i>Again, </i>he says, <i>shall be heard in this place </i>&#8212;<i> even in the cities of Judah and in the streets 			 of Jerusalem </i>&#8212;<i> the voice of joy, </i>etc. He repeats what we noticed yesterday, that the Jews put every obstacle they could in the way of their restoration. The narrowness of our hearts, we know does in a manner exclude an entrance as to God&#8217;s favor; for being filled, nay, swollen with unbelief, we suffer not God&#8217;s grace to enter into us. So the 			 Jews, by desponding and imagining that their calamity was incurable, and that no remedy was to be expected, rejected as far as they could the promised favor of deliverance This, then, is what the Prophet again upbraids them with, even that they said that the whole country and all the cities were destroyed, so that neither man nor beast remained. This was, indeed, the fact at that time, and the 			 Jews had spoken correctly; but as it was said yesterday, the ungodly never feel the scourges of God without rushing headlong into despair. Then what is condenmed is this, that the Jews thought that they were to perish without any hope of deliverance. Hence the Prophet here reproves their unbelief, and at the same time exhorts them to entertain hope. But he testifies that God&#8217;s grace would surpass all their wickedness.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.vii-p10"></A><a name="v.vii-p10.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.vii-p11"></A><i>Heard </i>then <i>shall be the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness; the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride; </i>that is, marriages shall again be celebrated. And this way of speaking often occurs in the Prophets when they refer to the 			 joyful condition of the city and of the people; for in seasons of mourning no one thinks of marrying a wife, so that marriage-feasts then cease as well as all festivals. Then the Prophet briefly shews that God would put an end to the calamities of the people, and give them reasons for rejoicing after he had for a time punished their sins.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.vii-p12"></A>But he shews also of what kind their joy would be, <i>The voice of them who shall say, Praise ye Jehovah of hosts</i> Here he distinguishes between the faithful and the ungodly, for joy is common to both, when prosperity happens to them; for God&#8217;s children may rejoice when the Lord shews himself to them as a bountiful 			 Father. But the profane exult through intemperate joy, and at the same time they make no mention of God, for they live only on present things; but the faithful raise up their thoughts to God, and never rejoice without thanksgiving. Thus they consecrate and sanctify their joy, when the ungodly, by polluting God&#8217;s blessing, do also contaminate their joy. We ought then to take special notice of this difference which the Prophet here intimates, between godly and profane joy; for the children of 			 this world do indeed exult, but as we have said, immoderately in their joy; and they are unthankful to God, and never duly reflect on his goodness; nay, they designedly turn away their eyes and their thoughts from God; but the faithful have always a regard to God whenever it succeeds well with them, for they know that everything flows to them from God&#8217;s goodness only.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.vii-p13"></A>Hence he says, Heard shall be the voice of them who shall say, <i>Praise ye Jehovah, for he is good, etc. </i>The Prophet here alludes to the customary practice of singing, which is spoken of in sacred history. For we know that when the Temple was dedicated, the praises of God were celebrated, and the Levites always 			 sang, <i>For his mercy is for ever</i> They first exhorted others to praise God, and to every sentence this repetition was added, &#8220;For his mercy is for ever.&#8221; What then had formerly been in common use the Prophet refers to: <i>Heard </i>then 			 <i>shall be </i>that usual song, <i>Praise ye Jehovah, for his mercy is for ever</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.vii-p14"></A>He then adds, <i>Of them who shall bring praise to the house of Jehovah; for I will restore the captivity of the land</i> He mentions sacrifices, for the service, according to the Law, required, that these should be added as evidences of gratitude. God indeed had no need of vetires, nor did he delight in external 			 displays; but these exercises of religion were necessary for a rude people, and still learning the elements of truth. The Prophet then speaks here with reference to a particular time, when he connects sacrifices with praises and thanksgiving, he yet shews for what end God required sacrifices to be then offered to him, lest the Jews should think that God was pacified when a calf had been slain. He then shews that all this had been prescribed to them, and enjoined for this end &#8212; that they might 			 shew themselves thankful.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.vii-p15"></A>This metonymical mode of speaking ought then to be carefully observed; for hence we conclude, that sacrifices of themselves were of no moment, but were only acceptable and of good odor to God on this account &#8212; because they were evidences of gratitude.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.vii-p16"></A>He then adds, <i>To the house of Jehovah</i> Now, this also ought in the last place to be noticed, &#8212; that it is not sufficient for one to be thankful to God, but that public thanksgiving is also required, so that we may mutually stimulate one another. And we also know that confession ought not to be separated from 			 faith; as faith has its seat in the heart, so also outward confession proceeds from it; and therefore it cannot be but that the interior feeling must break out from the soul, and the tongue be connected with the heart. It hence follows, that all those are guilty of falsehood who say that they have faith within, but are at the same time mute, and, as far as they can, unworthily bury the benefits of God. And as I have said, this zeal is required of all the godly, in order that they may stimulate 			 one another to praise God; for it was for this purpose and for this reason, that express mention is made of the Temple; that is, that the faithful might understand, that God is to be worshipped, not only privately and within closed doors, but that also a public profession ought to be made, so that they may together with common consent celebrate and acknowledge his benefits and blessings.</p>  <a name="v.viii"></A>

But in setting forth their quiet and peaceable condition, he speaks of shepherds; for we know that it is a 			 sure sign of peace, when flocks and herds are led into the fields in security. For enemies always gape after prey, and the experience of wars proves this; for whenever incursions are made by enemies, they send spies that they may know whether there are any shepherds or keepers of cattle; and then they know that there is a prey for them. As then shepherds, when an invasion from enemies is dreaded, dare not go forth, and as there is then no 			 liberty, the Prophet, in order to intimate that the Jews would be in a tranquil state, says, <i>There shall again be in this place the habitation of sheepherds, who will make their sheep, </i>or <i>their flock</i>, <i>to lie down</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.x-p9"></A>We now perceive the design of the Prophet; for one not sufficiently acquainted with Scripture might raise a question, Is this promise to be confined to shepherds and herdsmen? But, as I have already intimated, the answer is obvious, &#8212; The promise is general, but expressed in this way, &#8212; that God would be the guardian of his people, so that shepherds would drive here and there their flocks, and herdsmen their cattle, in perfect safety, and without 			 any fear of danger.</p>

<p><a name="v.x-p11"></A>And in the next verse Jeremiah confirms the same thing, where he mentions, as before, the cities of the mountains, and the cities of the plains, and then the cities of the south, and adds also the <i>land of Benjamin, </i>which was a different part of the country, and he mentions generally the <i>circuits of Jerusalem and the cities of Judah</i> What then? <i>The flocks, </i>he says, <i>shall pass under the hands of a numberer</i> Here, again, is set forth a greater security, because 			 shepherds would not, as it were, by stealth lead forth their sheep, and afterwards gather them in a hurry, as it is usually done, when there is any fear of danger. <i>The sheep, </i>he says, <i>shall pass under the hands of a numberer</i> This could not be the case but in time of 			 perfect peace and quietness; for where there is fear, the shepherds can hardly dare send forth their flocks, and then they dare not number them, but shut them in; and they are also often compelled to drive their flocks into forests and desert places, in order to conceal them. When, therefore, Jeremiah mentions the numbering of them, he intimates that the whole country would be in a state of peace, as in other words, and without a figure, he presently will tell us. But the Prophet in this way 			 exalted the benefits of God, and at the same time strengthened the minds of the weak, for as it has been said, this favor could have hardly been tasted by the Jews while in a state so despairing. The Prophet then made use of a homely and ordinary style when he spoke of flocks and herds. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="v.xi"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption17"><a name="v.xi-p1"></A><a name="v.xi-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014">Jeremiah 33:14</a><a name="v.xi-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="v.xi-p2"></A><b>14</b>. Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="v.xi-p3"></A><b>14</b>. Ecce dies veniunt, dicit Jehova, et excitabo <i>(vel, </i>stabilium) sermonum meum benum, quem loquutus sum <i>(vel, </i>pronuntiavi) ad domum Israel et ad domum Jehudah.</p> 				  			   		    		  
<p><a name="v.xi-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.xi-p5"></A><a name="v.xi-p5.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xi-p6"></A>Jeremiah now shews why God had promised that there would be a quiet <i>habitation for shepherds, </i>so that no one would by force take away their flocks. For God declares, that his promise would not be void, as its effects would shortly be evident, even when his mercy was 			 known by the ten tribes and by the kingdom of Judah. Hence he says, <i>The days shall come; </i>for it behoved the faithful to look farther than to their present condition. As they were then exposed to slaughter, though the unbelieving still entertained vain hopes, yet the children of God saw thousand deaths; so that it could not be but that terror almost drove them to despair; and in their 			 exile they saw that they were far removed from their own country, without any hope of a return. That the Prophet then might still support these, he bids them to extend their thoughts to a future time; and he had prefixed, as we have before seen, seventy years. It is the same then as though he had said, that the favor of which he predicts could not be laid hold on, except the faithful held their minds in suspense, and patiently waited until the time of the promised deliverance came.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xi-p7"></A><i>Coming </i>then <i>are the days, and I will rouse, </i>or as some render it, &#8220;and I will establish;&#8221; and both meanings may suit; for <a name="v.xi-p7.1"></A>&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; <i>kum, </i>means to rise, but here in an active or transitive sense it means to make to rise. However, its meaning sometimes is to establish, and sometimes to rouse,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">90</FONT></A>
 			  so as to make that to appear which was before hidden. And this mode of speaking is fitly adopted as to the promises of God; for they seem for a time to he dormant without any effect, or seem to disappear or vanish away. Hence the stability of the promises then appears, and is seen when God raises them up, they being before hidden and concealed from the faithful. The meaning of the Prophet is, that God would at length render evident the power of his word, by 			 fulfilling it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xi-p9"></A>But from this manner of speaking, a useful doctrine may be deduced: for we are thus reminded that the promises of God are not always so manifest, that their effect or accomplishment is evident to us, but on the contrary they may appear to be dead and void. When it is so, let us learn to exercise faith and patience, so that our souls may not tremble, though God&#8217;s promises may not every moment manifest their power by being 			 actually fulfilled. In short, the true application of prophetic truth is, that we never lay hold on, and really embrace the promises of God, except we look forward to the <i>days that are coming, </i>that is, except we patiently wait for the time prefixed by God: and further, except our faith leans on the promises, when they seem to he dormant, it is not firm, and has no roots or 			 foundations; for as the root which nourishes the tree is not seen, but lies hid in the earth, and as the foundation of a house is not visible to our eyes, so ought our faith to be in like manner founded, and to drive deep roots into God&#8217;s promises, so that its firmness may not be in the air, nor have a visible surface, but a hidden foundation. This then is the import and the proper application of this doctrine.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xi-p10"></A>But God calls it his <i>good word, </i>because he had promised to be the deliverer of his people. The word of God, when it denounces all kinds of death, and contains nothing but terrors, is always good, if goodness be taken for what is just and right; and hence God, by Ezekiel, reproves the Jews, because his word was 			 bitter to them, and says,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.xi-p11"></A>&#8220;Are the ways of the Lord crooked and thorny? Ye are awry,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and not my word.&#8221; (<a name="v.xi-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#025">Eze 18:25</a><a name="v.xi-p11.1"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xi-p12"></A>But here the goodness of the word is to be taken for the deliverance of the people; for when God shakes the despisers of his Law with terror, his word is called evil on account of its effect. At the same time, as I have already said, whether God offers to us his favor and mercy, or denounces vengeance on the unbelieving, his word is ever good and right, though it may not be pleasant. This then relates to the apprehensions of 			 men when he says, <i>I will rouse, </i>or establish, <i>my good word</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xi-p13"></A>He afterwards adds, <i>which I have spoken;&#8217;</i>by which clause he confirms the doctrine of Jeremiah, for he shews that he was its author, and that Jeremiah brought nothing from himself, but faithfully testified of his mercy and of the liberation of the people according to the commission he had received. We are at the 			 same time reminded, that we are not presumptuously to hope for anything, except God has spoken. Let us then learn to embrace his promises, so that none of us may look for this or that, but know that then only he will be propitious to us, when we lean on his word. He afterwards speaks of the kingdom of Israel, and of the kingdom of Judah, to intimate that he would be merciful to the whole people, though the ten tribes had been for a long time separated from the tribe of Judah, and from the half 			 tribe of Benjamin, as it has been stated elsewhere. It follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="v.xii"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption17"><a name="v.xii-p1"></A><a name="v.xii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015">Jeremiah 33:15</a><a name="v.xii-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="v.xii-p2"></A><b>15</b>. In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="v.xii-p3"></A><b>15</b>. Diebus illis et termpore illo germinare faciam Davidi germen justitiae; et faciet judicium et justitiam in terra.</p> 				  			   		    		  
<p><a name="v.xii-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.xii-p5"></A><a name="v.xii-p5.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xii-p6"></A>Here the Prophet shews what Paul afterwards has spoken of, that all the promises of God are in Christ yea and amen, (<a name="v.xii-p6.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020">2Co 1:20</a><a name="v.xii-p6.1"></A>) that is, that they do not stand nor can be valid as to us, except Christ interposes to sanction or confirm them. Then the efficacy of God&#8217;s promises depends on Christ alone. And hence the Prophets, when speaking of the 			 grace of God, come at length to Christ, for without him all the promises would vanish away. Let us also know that the Jews had been so trained as ever to flee to God&#8217;s covenant; for on the general covenant depended all particular promises. As, for instance, Jeremiah has hitherto been often prophesying of God&#8217;s mercy to the people, after having punished them for their sins; now this promise was special. How then could the Jews and the Israelites believe that they should return to their own 			 country? This special promise could have been of no moment, except as it was an appendix of the covenant, even because God had adopted them as his people. As then the Jews knew that they had been chosen as a peculiar people, and that God was their Father, hence their faith in all the promises. Now, again, we must bear in mind, that the covenant was founded on Christ alone; for God had not only promised to Abraham that he would be a Father to his seed, but had also added an earnest or a pledge 			 that a Redeemer would come.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xii-p7"></A>We now then perceive the reason why the Prophets, when they sought to strengthen the faithful in the hope of salvation, set forth Christ, because the promises had no certainty without the general covenant. And further, as the general covenant could not stand, nor have any validity, except in Christ, this is the point to which Jeremiah now turns his attention, as we have also seen in other places, especially in the twenty-third chapter, from 			 which he repeats this prophecy. God then had promised that his people would be restored; he had also promised that he would be so propitious to them as to preserve them in safety as his people: he now adds &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xii-p8"></A><i>In those days, and at that time, I will raise up, </i>I will cause to germinate; the verb in the twenty-third chapter is <a name="v.xii-p8.1"></A>&#1492;&#1511;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;, <i>ekamti, </i>I will cause to rise; but here, &#8220;I will cause to germinate;&#8221; and there we read, &#8220;a righteous branch,&#8221; but here, &#8220;a branch of righteousness,&#8221; which means the same thing. But why does the Prophet now speak of the seed of David? It is not an abrupt sentence; and the reason is, because the minds of the faithful would have alwass vacillated, had not Christ been brought forward, on whom the eternal and unchangeable covenant of God was founded. But 			 they could not have had any taste of God&#8217;s grace, had they not known that they had been gratuitously chosen by him. Adoption then was the foundation of the covenant; and then Christ was the earnest and pledge of the covenant, as well as of gratuitous adoption. Hence it was, that the Prophet, wishing to seal and confirm his prophecy, bids the faithful to look to Christ.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xii-p9"></A>He says, <i>In those days, and at that time; </i>for, as it is said in the proverb, &#8220;Even quickness is delay when we have ardent wishes,&#8221; so now a long delay might have produced weariness iu the Israelites. That they might not, then, be carried away by too much haste, he mentions <i>those days </i>and <i>that time</i> So that if God deferred the time, that they might check themselves, he says, <i>I will make to grow for David a righteous branch</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xii-p10"></A>This passage ought, no doubt, to be understood of Christ. We know that it was a common thing with the Jews, that whenever the Prophets promised to them the seed of David, to direct their attention to Christ. This was then a mode of teaching familiarly known to the Jews. The Prophets, indeed, sometimes mentioned David himself, and not his son,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.xii-p11"></A>&#8220;I will raise up David,&#8221; etc. (<a name="v.xii-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023">Eze 34:23</a><a name="v.xii-p11.1"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xii-p12"></A>Now David was dead, and his body was reduced to dust and ashes; but under the person of David, the Prophets exhibited Christ. Then as to this passage, the Jews must shew their effrontery in a most ridiculous manner, if they make evasions and attempt to apply it otherwise than to Christ. This being the ease, were any one to ask now the Jews, how this prophecy has been fulfilled, it would be necessary for them to acknowledge Christ, or to deny 			 faith in God, and also in Jeremiah. It is, indeed, certain that Jeremiah celebrates here the grace of deliverance especially on this account, because a Redeemer was shortly to come. For the return of the Jews to their own land, what was it? We know that they, even immediately at their restoration, were in a miserable state, though their condition then was much better than afterwards; for in after times they were cruelly treated by Antiochus and other kings of Syria: they were ever exposed to 			 the heathens around them, so that they were harassed and plundered by them at pleasure. Then during the whole of that time which preceded the coming of Christ, God did not fulfill what he had promised by Jeremiah and his other servants. What is now their condition? Dispersed through the whole world; and they have been so for more than fifteen hundred years, since Christ arose from the dead; and we see that they pine away under their calamities, so their curse seems dreadful to all. God had, 			 indeed, spoken by Moses, and then repeated it by his Prophets,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.xii-p13"></A>&#8220;Ye shall be for a hissing and for a curse to all nations.&#8221; <br> 			 (<a name="v.xii-p13.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037">De 28:37</a><a name="v.xii-p13.2"></A>; <a name="v.xii-p13.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#018">Jer 25:18</a><a name="v.xii-p13.3"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xii-p14"></A>But that punishment was to be for a time. There is, therefore, no reason for what the Jews allege. It hence appears that they are wholly destitute of all credit, and only perversely pretend, I know not what, that there may be some show, though wholly hypocritical, in what they assert. But with regard to us, we see that the promise respecting the coming of the Messiah has not been made in vain; and we also know, that it happened, through the 			 wonderful purpose of God, that the Jews did not enjoy full and real happiness, such as had been promised at the coming of Christ, lest they should think that what all God&#8217;s servants had promised was then accomplished: for we know how disposed men are to be satisfied with earthly things. The Jews might then have thought that their happiness was completed, had not God exercised them with many troubles, in order that they might ever look forward to the manifestation of Christ.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xii-p15"></A>He calls it <i>the Branch of righteousness, </i>by way of contrast, because the children of David had become degenerated; and God had almost deemed them accursed, for the greatest part of the kings were destitute of God&#8217;s grace. There was, then, but one Branch of righteousness, even Christ. We further know how wide and 			 extensive is Christ&#8217;s righteousness, for he communicates it to us. But we ought to begin with that righteousness which I have mentioned, that is, what is in opposition to the many changes which happened to the posterity of David, for things often were in a very low state. Though<i> unto David, </i><a name="v.xii-p15.1"></A>&#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;<i> 			 Ladavid, </i>is often taken as meaning, &#8220;I will raise up the branch of David,&#8221; yet God seems here to refer to the promise which he had made to David, as God is said in many passages to have sworn to his servant David. (<a name="v.xii-p15.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003">Ps. 89:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011">Ps. 132:11</a><a name="v.xii-p15.2"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xii-p16"></A>It follows, <i>And he shall execute judgement and justice in the land</i> By these words a right government is denoted; for when the two words are joined tegether, justice refers to the defense of the innocent, and judgment to the punishment of iniquity; for except the wicked are restrained by the fear of the law, they 			 would violate all order. Judgment, indeed, when by itself, means the right administration of the law; but as I have already said, justice and judgment include the protection of the good, and also the restraint of the wicked, who become not obedient willingly or of their own accord. In a word, the promise is, that the king here spoken of would be upright and just, so as to be in every way perfect, and exhibit the model of the best of kings.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xii-p17"></A>But we must always observe the contrast between the other descendants of David and Christ. For the Jews had seen the saddest spectacles in the posterity of David: many of them were apostates, and perverted the worship of God; others raged against the Prophets and all good men, and were also full of avarice and rapacity, and given to all kinds of lusts. Since, then, their kings had debased themselves with so many crimes, there is here promised 			 a king who would so discharge his office as to be owned as the true minister of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xii-p18"></A>It is, at the same time, necessary to bear in mind the character of Christ&#8217;s kingdom. It is, we know, spiritual; but it is set forth under the image or form of an earthly and civil government; for whenever the Prophets speak of Christ&#8217;s kingdom, they set before us an earthly form, because spiritual truth, without any metaphor, could not have been sufficiently understood by a rude people in their childhood. There is no wonder, then, that the 			 Prophets, wishing to accommodate their words to the capacity of the Jews, should so speak of Christ&#8217;s kingdom as to portray it before them as an earthly and civil government. But it is necessary for us to consider what sort of kingdom it is. As, then, it is spiritual, the justice and judgment of which the Prophet speaks, do not belong only to civil and external order, but rather to that rectitude by which it comes that men are reformed according to God&#8217;s image, which is in righteousness and 			 truth. Christ then is said to reign over us in justice and judgment, not only because he keeps us by laws within the range of our duty, and defends the good and the innocent, and represses the audacity of the wicked; but because he rules us by his Spirit. And of the Spirit we know what Christ himself declares, &#8220;The Spirit shall convince the world of righteousness and judgment,&#8221; etc. (<a name="v.xii-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008">Joh 16:8</a><a name="v.xii-p18.1"></A>) Hence we must come 			 to spiritual jurisdiction, if we wish to understand what that righteousness is which is here mentioned: of the same kind also is the judgment that is added. It afterwards follows, &#8212;</p>  <a name="v.xiii"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption17"><a name="v.xiii-p1"></A><a name="v.xiii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016">Jeremiah 33:16</a><a name="v.xiii-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="v.xiii-p2"></A><b>16</b>. In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this <i>is the name </i>wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="v.xiii-p3"></A><b>16</b>. Diebus illis servabitur Jehudah, et Jerusalem habitabitur secure; et hoc nomen quo vocabitur ipsa, Jehova justitia nostra.</p> 				  			   		    		  
<p><a name="v.xiii-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.xiii-p5"></A><a name="v.xiii-p5.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xiii-p6"></A>Here the Prophet extends the benefits of the kingdom to all the Jews, and shews how much was to be expected fromthat kingdom which he had promised; for in it would be found perfect happiness and safety. Had not this been added, what we have heard of the righteous king would have appeared cold and uninteresting; for it sometimes happens, that however much the king may exercise justice and judgment, yet the people continue 			 still miserable. But the Prophet testifies here that the people would be in every way blessed and happy, when governed by the King promised to come. Hence he says, <i>In those days Judah shall be saved</i> He promises salvation to the Jews, though under that name are included also, as it is often the case, the ten tribes. He adds <i>Jerusalem, </i>but in a similar sense, <i>Jerusalem shall dwell safely, </i>that is, shall be in a peaceable state. This mode of speaking is taken from Moses; for the Prophets, whenever they spoke of God&#8217;s blessings, are wont to borrow their doctrine from that fountain. He then says, that the people would be saved, and 			 then that they would be in peace and quietness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xiii-p7"></A>It may now be proper to repeat what I have already touched upon, &#8212; that the salvation mentioned here belongs to the kingdom of Christ. Had he been speaking of some earthly or temporal government, the salvation must also have been temporal. But as the spiritual and celestial kingdom of Christ is the object of the promise, the salvation mentioned must reach to the very heavens. Hence its limits are far wider than the whole world. In short, the 			 salvation of which Jeremiah now prophesies, is not to be confined to the boundaries of a fading life, nor is it to be sought in this world, where it has no standing; but if we wish to know what it is, we must learn to raise our thoughts upwards, and above the world and everything that exists here. It is an eternal salvation. In the meantime, Christ gives us some foretaste of this salvation in this life, according to what is said,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.xiii-p8"></A>&#8220;godliness has the promises of the present as well <br> 			 as of the future life.&#8221; (<a name="v.xiii-p8.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008">1Ti 4:8</a><a name="v.xiii-p8.2"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xiii-p9"></A>But as this promise ought to be applied to the kingdom of Christ, there is no doubt but it is perpetual, and ought to raise up our thoughts to heaven itself.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xiii-p10"></A>To salvation is added <i>safety; </i>for were the faithful ever to fear and tremble, where would be their salvation? And we know that the happiness brought to us by Christ cannot be otherwise received, except through peace, according to what Scripture so often teaches us:</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.xiii-p11"></A>&#8220;Having been justified,&#8221; says Paul, &#8220;we have peace with God.&#8221; <br> 			 (<a name="v.xiii-p11.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001">Ro 5:1</a><a name="v.xiii-p11.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xiii-p12"></A>And then when he speaks in the fourteenth chapter of the same Epistle of the kingdom of God, he says that it consists in joy and peace; and in another place he says,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.xiii-p13"></A>&#8220;May the peace of God, which surpasses all conception, obtain the victory in your hearts.&#8221; (<a name="v.xiii-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007">Php 4:7</a><a name="v.xiii-p13.1"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xiii-p14"></A>Hence these things are connected together, salvation and peace, not that we enjoy this joyful and peaceful state in the world; for they greatly deceive themselves who dream of such a quiet state here, as we have to engage in a perpetual warfare, until God at length gathers us to the fruition of a blessed rest. We must, therefore, contend and fight in this world. Thus the faithful shall ever be exposed to many troubles; and hence Christ 			 reminds his disciples, &#8220;In me ye have peace; but in theworld&#8221; &#8212; what? Sorrows and troubles. (<a name="v.xiii-p14.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033">Joh 16:33</a><a name="v.xiii-p14.1"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xiii-p15"></A>We now, then, see why the Prophet joined safety or security to salvation, even because we cannot otherwise know that we shall be saved, except we be fully persuaded that God so cares for our salvation as to protect us by his power, and that his aid will be always ready whenever needed.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xiii-p16"></A>He in the last place adds, <i>And this is the name by which they shall call her, Jehovah our righteousness</i> In chapter 23 (<a name="v.xiii-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#000">Jeremiah 23</a><a name="v.xiii-p16.1"></A>) this name is given to Christ, and to him alone it properly belongs; but it is here transferred to the Church, for whatever belongs to the head, is made common to all the members. 			 For we indeed know that Christ has nothing as his own, for as he is made righteousness, it belongs to us, according to what Paul says,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.xiii-p17"></A>&#8220;He is made to us righteousness, and redemption, and sanctification, and wisdom.&#8221; <br> 			 (<a name="v.xiii-p17.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030">1Co 1:30</a><a name="v.xiii-p17.2"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xiii-p18"></A>As, then, the Father conferred righteousness on his own Son for our sake, it is no wonder that what is in his power is transferred to us. What, then, we found in the twenty-third chapter was rightly declared, for it belongs peculiarly to Christ, that he is God our righteousness. But as we partake of this righteousness, when he admits us into a participation of all the blessings by which he is adorned and enriched by the Father, it hence 			 follows, that this also belongs to the whole Church, even that God is its righteousness.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">91</FONT></A>
 			 Hence it is wisely said by the Prophet, that this would be the name of the whole Church, which could not be, except it had put on Christ, so that God might reign there in righteousness, for the righteousness of Christ extends to all the faithful; and Christ also dwells in them, so that they are not only the temples of Christ, but, as it were, a part of him; and even the Church itself is by Paul called Christ,</p>

<p><a name="v.xvi-p8"></A>The Prophet had spoken of the restoration of the Church; he now confirms the same truth, for he promises that the kingdom and the priesthood would be perpetual. The safety of the people, as it is well known, was secured by these two things; for without a king they were like an imperfect or a maimed body, and without a priesthood there was nothing but ruin; for the priest was, as it were, the mediator between God and the people, and the 			 king represented God. We now, then, perceive the object of the Prophet, why he speaks expressly here of the kingdom and the priesthood, for the people could not otherwise have any ground to stand on. He therefore declares that the condition of the people would be safe, because there would always be some of the posterity of David, who would succeed to govern them, and there would always be some of the posterity of Levi, to offer sacrifices.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xvi-p9"></A>But this passage ought to be carefully noticed, for we hence gather, that though all other things were given to us according to our wishes, we should yet be ever miserable, except we had Christ as our head, to perform the office of a king and of a priest. This, then, is the only true happiness of the Church, even to be in subjection to Christ, so that he may exercise towards us the two offices described here. Hence also we gather, 			 that these are the two marks of a true Church, by which she is to be distinguished from all conventicles, who falsely profess the name of God, and boast themselves to be Churches. For where the kingdom and priesthood of Christ are found, there, no doubt, is the Church; but where Christ is not owned as a king and a priest, nothing is there but confusion, as under the Papacy; for though they pretend the name of Christ, yet, as they do not submit to his government and laws, nor are 			 satisfied with his priesthood, but have devised for themselves numberless patrons and advocates, it is quite evident that, notwithstanding the great splendor of the Papacy, it is nothing but an abomination before God. Let us, then, learn to begin with the kingdom and the priesthood, when we speak of the state and government of the Church.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xvi-p10"></A>Now we know that in David was promised a spiritual kingdom, for what was David but a type of Christ? As God then gave in David a living image of his only-begotten Son, we ought ever to pass from the temporal kingdom to the eternal, from the visible to the spiritual, from the earthly to the celestial. The same thing ought to be said of the priesthood; for no mortal can reconcile God to men, and make an atonement for sins; and further, the blood 			 of bulls and of goats could not pacify the wrath of God, nor incense, nor the sprinkling of,water, nor any of the things which belonged to the ceremonial laws; they could not, give the hope of salvation, so as to quiet trembling consciences. It then follows, that that priesthood was shadowy, and that the Levites represented Christ until he came.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xvi-p11"></A>But the Prophet here speaks according to the <i>circumstances </i>of his own time, when he says, <i>Cut off shall not be from David a man, </i>who may <i>sit on the throne of the house of 			 Israel; </i>and then, <i>cut off shall not be from the priests, the Levites, a man </i>who may <i>kindle burnt-offerings burn an oblation, </i>etc.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">92</FONT></A>
 			  Why does he not speak in general of the whole people? Why does he not promise that the twelve tribes would be saved? for this would be, a matter of greater moment. But as we have said, we ought to understand this principle, that every kind of blessing is included here, so that men are always in a miserable state unless they are ruled by Christ and have him as their priest.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xvi-p16"></A>But it may be asked here, how does this prophecy agree with facts? for from the time Jeremiah promised such a state of things, there has been no successor to David. It is true, indeed, that Zerubbabel was a leader among the people, but he was without a royal title or dignity. There was no throne, no crown, no scepter, from the time in which the people returned from their Babylonian exile; and yet God testified by the mouth of Jeremiah that 			 there would be those from the posterity of David, who would govern the people in continual succession. He does not stay that they would be chiefs or leaders, but he adorns them with a royal title. Some one, he says, will ever remain to occupy the throne. I have said already that there has been no throne. But we must bear in mind what Ezekiel says, that an interruption as to the kingdom is not contrary to this prophecy, as to the perpetuity of the kingdom, or continued succession,<i> 			 </i>(<a name="v.xvi-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027">Eze 21:27</a><a name="v.xvi-p16.1"></A>) for he prophesied that the crown would be cast down, until the legitimate successor of David came. It was therefore necessary that the diadem should fall and be cast on the ground, or be transverted, as the Prophet says, until Christ was manifested. As, then, this had been declared, now when our Prophet speaks of kings succeeding David, we must so understand what he says as that that 			 should remain true which has been said of the cast down diadem. God, then, did cast down the diadem until the legitimate successor came. Ezekiel does not only say, &#8220;Cast ye it down transverted,&#8221; but he repeats the words three times, intimating thereby that the interruption would be long. There was, therefore, no cause of stumbling, when there was no kind of government, nor dignity, nor power; for it was necessary to look forward to the king, to whom the diadem, or the royal crown, was to 			 be restored.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xvi-p17"></A>We now then see how it was that there have been always those of David&#8217;s posterity who occupied the throne; though this was hidden, yet it may be gathered from other prophetic testimonies. For Amos, when he speaks of Christ&#8217;s coming, makes this announcement,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.xvi-p18"></A>&#8220;There shall come at that time one who will repair the ruins of the tabernacle of David.&#8221; (<a name="v.xvi-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011">Am 9:11</a><a name="v.xvi-p18.1"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xvi-p19"></A>It was therefore necessary that the kingdom should be, as it were, demolished when Christ appeared. We further know what Isaiah says,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.xvi-p20"></A>&#8220;Come forth shall a shoot from the root of Jesse.&#8221; <br> 			 (<a name="v.xvi-p20.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001">Isa 11:1</a><a name="v.xvi-p20.2"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xvi-p21"></A>He does not there name David, but a private person, who was content with a humble, retired, and rustic life; for a husbandman and a shepherd, as it is well known, was Jesse the father of David. In short, whenever the Prophets declare that the kingdom of David would be perpetual, they do not promise that there would be a succession without interruption; but this ought to be referred to that perpetuity which was at length manifested in 			 Christ alone. We have said elsewhere, how the time of return ought to be connected with the coming of Christ. For it is not necessary nor expedient to introduce an anagogical sense, as interpreters are wont to do, by representing the return of the people as symbolical of what was higher, even of the deliverance which was effected by Christ; for it ought to be considered as one and the same favor of God, that is, that he brought back his people from exile, that they might at length enjoy quiet 			 and solid happiness when the kingdom of David should again be established.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.xvi-p22"></A><a name="v.xvi-p22.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xvi-p23"></A>As to the priesthood, the same difficulty might be raised, for we know that the priesthood became corrupted; nay, that for the most part the priests not only became degenerate, but altogether sacrilegious. Hence the sacerdotal name itself became nothing else but a base and wicked profanation of all sacred things. But it was God&#8217;s purpose in this manner to shew that another priest was to be expected, and that men were not to look on figures and 			 types, but were to raise their thoughts higher, even to him who was to be the only true Mediator to reconcile God to men.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xvi-p24"></A>By saying, <i>who may kindle a burnt-offering, etc</i>., he specifies certain things, or some parts of the priest&#8217;s office, because the Prophets accommodated their discourses to men of their own age and time, and described the kingdom and priesthood of Christ under those external symbols, which were then in use. It is 			 hence proper to take the ceremonies of the Law as denoting the reality, or what they signified. For Christ offered no calves, nor any incense, but fulfilled all these things which were then set forth to the people under symbols. And he speaks of <i>burning, </i>or perfuming the <i>oblation, </i><a name="v.xvi-p24.1"></A>&#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;<i>, meneche, </i>for though the oblation remained entire, there was yet a perfuming made by frankincense, and a small portion of the flour was burnt. It is then a mode of speaking, when a part is stated for the whole. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="v.xvii"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption17"><a name="v.xvii-p1"></A><a name="v.xvii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#019">Jeremiah 33:19-21</a><a name="v.xvii-p1.1"></A></p>

<p><a name="v.xvii-p10"></A>He confirms the same thing, but by introducing a similitude; for he shews that God&#8217;s covenant with the people of Israel would not be less firm than the settled order of nature. Unceasing are the progresses of the sun, moon, and stars; continual is the succession of day and night. This settled state of things is so fixed, that in so great and so multiplied a variety there is no change. We have now rain, then fair weather, and we have various 			 changes in the seasons; but the sun still continues its daily course, the moon is new every month, and the revolving of day and night, which God has appointed, never ceases; and this unbroken order declares, as it is said in <a name="v.xvii-p10.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#000">Psalm 19</a><a name="v.xvii-p10.1"></A>, the wonderful wisdom of God. The Prophet then sets before us here the order of nature, and says, that God&#8217;s covenant with his Church shall be no less fixed and unchangeable than what it is with mankind, with regard to the government of the world.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.xvii-p11"></A><a name="v.xvii-p11.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xvii-p12"></A>We now perceive the purpose of the Prophet in saying, <i>If void ye can make my covenant respecting the day and the night, then abolished shall be my covenant with David and the Levites</i> Now he indirectly touches on the wickedness of the people; for the Jews did, as far as they could, overthrow, by their murmurs 			 and complaints, the covenant of God; for in their adversities they instantly entertained the thought and also expressed it, that God had forgotten his covenant. This want of faith then is intimated by the Prophet, as though he had said, &#8220;Why are these complaints? It is the same thing as though ye sought to pull down the sun and the moon from the heavens, and to subvert the difference between day and night, and to upset the whole order of nature; for I am the same God, who has settled the 			 succession of day and night, and has promised that the Church shall continue for ever: ye can, therefore, no more abolish my covenant with David than the general law of nature.&#8221; We now then understand the Prophet&#8217;s object: for this was not said without conveying reproof; because they were very wicked and ungrateful to God, when they doubted his truth and constancy, respecting the promise as to the perpetual condition of the Church. He in short intimates that they were carried away, as it were, 			 by a blind madness, when they thus hesitated to believe God&#8217;s covenant, as though they attempted to subvert the whole world, so that there should be no longer any difference between light and darkness.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.xvii-p13"></A><a name="v.xvii-p13.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xvii-p14"></A>Hence he says, <i>There shall be abolished my covenant with David my servant, that he should not be my son, </i>etc. He repeats what he had said, even that it could not be but that the posterity of David should obtain the kingdom, which we know has been fulfilled in Christ. <i>The throne 			 </i>of David he now calls what he had named before as the throne of the house of Israel; but he means the same thing. It is called the throne of the house of Israel, because the king and the people are relatively connected, and also because the posterity of David ruled for the public good, not for their own sake.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xvii-p15"></A>He adds, <i>and with the Levites, the priests, my ministers</i> He had called David his <i>servant, </i>he now calls the Levites his <i>ministers. </i>The word <a name="v.xvii-p15.1"></A>&#1513;&#1512;&#1514;<i> sheret, </i>is commonly known, and is used often by Moses, when speaking of the Levitical priesthood.

<p><a name="v.xviii-p6"></A>There is an omission at the beginning; the particle of comparison is left out, for <a name="v.xviii-p6.1"></A>&#1488;&#1513;&#1512;<i> asher, </i>cannot be taken for <a name="v.xviii-p6.2"></A>&#1499;&#1488;&#1513;&#1512;<i> caasher: As the 			 hosts of the heavens cannot be numbered, </i>nor <i>the sand of the sea, </i>so God promises that he would <i>multiply the seed of David, </i>and also the <i>Levites. </i>This 			 promise, as given to Abraham, referred to the whole body of the people; for when Abraham was bidden to go out, and to look on the heavens, God made this promise to him, &#8220;Number the stars, if thou canst, and the sands of the sea, so shall thy seed be.&#8221; We hence see that this blessing was extended to the whole seed of Abraham, and especially to the twelve tribes. And now it is confined to the family of David, and to the Levitical tribe.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xviii-p7"></A>But what we have already touched upon ought to be borne in mind, &#8212; that the safety of the people was grounded on the kingdom and the priesthood. As then kings ruled not for themselves, nor had the sacerdotal dignity been given to the Levites for their own private advantage, but for the sake of the people, so now the Prophet, stating a part for the whole, intimates that the whole people would be secure and safe, when the royal and sacerdotal 			 dignity flourished. There is not, then, anything diminished from God&#8217;s promise, as though the other tribes were not to multiply; but what Jeremiah testifies respecting the family of David and the Levitical tribe, is to be extended, without any difference, to the whole Church. It is yet not without reason that an especial mention is made of David and Levi; for, as it has been said, the Church must have been in a miserable state, without a head, and without a Mediator. There is, however, no doubt 			 but that Jeremiah alluded to that passage which we have already quoted, (<a name="v.xviii-p7.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005">Ge 15:5</a><a name="v.xviii-p7.1"></A>; <a name="v.xviii-p7.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#018">Ro 4:18</a><a name="v.xviii-p7.2"></A>) and thus he reproved the want of faith in the people; for they could not have doubted the restoration of the Church without impugning the truth of God, as though he had given only vain words to Abraham, when he said,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.xviii-p8"></A>&#8220;Number the stars of heaven if thou canst, and the sands of the sea, so shall thy seed be.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xviii-p9"></A>He therefore shews that God would be true and faithful in that promise, so as to multiply his Church like the stars of heaven, and the sands of the sea. It follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="v.xix"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption17"><a name="v.xix-p1"></A><a name="v.xix-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#023">Jeremiah 33:23-24</a><a name="v.xix-p1.1"></A></p>

<p class="Normal"><a name="v.xix-p7"></A><a name="v.xix-p7.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xix-p8"></A>He now assigns a reason why he had so largely spoken of the deliverance of the people and of their perpetual preservation, even because the blessing promised by God was regarded as uncertain by the unbelieving. Farther, God not only reminds his Prophet why he bade him to repeat so often the same thing, but speaks also for the sake of the people, in order that they might know that this repetition was not in vain, as it was necessary to contend 			 against their perverse wickedness; for they had so filled their minds and hearts with despair, that they rejected all God&#8217;s promises, and gave no place to faith or hope.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xix-p9"></A>There are some who explain this passage of the Chaldeans, who regarded the people with great contempt. But this explanation is cold and unmeaning. I have no doubt but that God here expostulates with the Israelites, because they relinquished the hope of a deliverance; for Jeremiah would not have spoken thus of the Chaldeans, <i>Hast thou not seen this people? 			 </i>He expostulates with Jeremiah, because he had not moved from the city. He then shews, according to what I have already observed, that there was a necessity why he should so often confirm what had been said so plainly before of the return of the people, <i>Hast thou not seen, </i>he says, <i>how this 			 people speak? saying, Jehovah now rejects the two families whom he had chosen, </i>even the kingdom of Israel and the kingdom of Judah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xix-p10"></A>It was indeed an unhappy event, that the people had been divided into two parts; for they ought to have been one nation. But though it had happened through the defection of the ten tribes that the body of the people had been torn asunder, yet the Prophet, according to the usual way of speaking, says, that the <i>two families </i>had been 			 <i>chosen</i> The election of God was indeed different, even that the seed of Abraham might be one: for as there is but one head, so there ought to be but one body. But God had not wholly cast away the ten tribes, though they had wickedly and impiously revolted from the family of David. He then says, according to the language which prevailed, that the <i>two families </i>had been <i>rejected, </i>that is, the kingdom of Israel and the kingdom of Judah. Now the people said, that both were rejected, which was true, but not in the sense they intended; for as it has been before said, they thought that there was no hope remaining, as though the covenant of God had been wholly 			 abolished, while yet the rejection was only for a time.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xix-p11"></A>We hence see what God reproved in the common language of the people, even because they entertained no hope of mercy and pardon; for being struck with amazement, they had cast aside every thought of God&#8217;s promises, when they saw that they were to go into exile. For as before they had hardened themselves against threatenings, so now despair immediately laid hold on their minds, so that they could not conceive any idea of God&#8217;s 			 goodness and mercy. He adds, that <i>the people were contemptible in their eyes, so as not to be a nation any more</i> Thus in the third place he teaches what we have before observed.</p>  <a name="v.xx"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption17"><a name="v.xx-p1"></A><a name="v.xx-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#025">Jeremiah 33:25-26</a><a name="v.xx-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="v.xx-p2"></A><b>25</b>. Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant <i>be </i>not with day and night, <i>and if</i> I have not appointed the ordinantes of heaven and earth;</p> 				   				
<p><a name="v.xx-p3"></A><b>25</b>. Sic dicit Jehova, Si non foedus meum diei et noctis, leges coelorum et terrae non posuero <i>(repetendum est </i><a name="v.xx-p3.1"></A>&#1488;&#1501;<i> si, </i>si non posuero leges, <i>vel, statuta, </i>coelorum et terrae:)</p>

<p><a name="v.xx-p5"></A><b>26</b>. Etiam semen Jacob et Davidis servi mei reprobabo, ut non assumam ex semine ejus qui dominetur super semine Abrahae, Isaac et Jacob; quia reducam captivitatem eorum, et miserabor eorum.</p>

<p class="Normal"><a name="v.xx-p7"></A><a name="v.xx-p7.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xx-p8"></A>Here God opposes the constancy of his faithfulness to their perverse murmurings, of which he had complained; and he again adduces the similitude previously brought forward: <i>&#8220;lf, </i>then, I <i>have not fixed my covenant, </i>or if there is no covenant <i>as to the day and the night, </i>&#8212;<i> if there are no laws as to heaven and earth, then I shall now cast away the seed of Jacob and the seed of David: </i>but if my constancy is 			 ever conspicuous as to the laws of nature, how is it that ye ascribe not to me my due honor? For I am the same God, who created the heaven and the earth, who fixed all the laws of nature which remain unchangeable, and who also have made a covenant with my Church. If my faithfulness as to the laws of nature changes not, wily should it change as to that sacred covenant which I have made with my chosen people?&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xx-p9"></A>We now see the reason why God so often confirmed a thing in itself sufficiently clear, even because the contest with the obstinate hopelessness of the people was difficult. For they thought that they were rejected without any hope of deliverance, when God punished them only for a time for their wickedness, as they deemed their exile to be without a return.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.xx-p10"></A><a name="v.xx-p10.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xx-p11"></A>He mentions the <i>seed of Jacob </i>first, because it had been said to Abraham, <i>For thy seed, </i>and the same promise was repeated to Jacob. (<a name="v.xx-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#004">Ge 26:4</a><a name="v.xx-p11.1"></A>; <a name="v.xx-p11.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#014">Ge 28:14</a><a name="v.xx-p11.2"></A>) He afterwards adds the <i>seed of David, </i>because an especial promise was afterwards given to David, (<a name="v.xx-p11.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012">2 Sam. 7:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013">13</a><a name="v.xx-p11.3"></A>:) <i>Then also the seed of David, </i>he says, <i>will I reject, that I should not take of his seed to rule over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: </i>he now fitly joins together what might have seemed unconnected; for he says, that there would be 			 always some of David&#8217;s posterity to rule over all the tribes. God, therefore, thus preserved his Church when he set a king over his Church; or a kingdom, as we have said, is inseparable from the safety of the people.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xx-p12"></A>He lastly adds, <i>For I will restore their captivity</i> This obviated the diffidence of the people: for an objection was ready at hand, &#8220;What can this mean? for the ten tribes have been already led away into distant regions, and are scattered; a part also of the kingdom 			 of Judah has been cut off; and what remains is not far from entire ruin.&#8221; Hence God calls their attention to the hope of deliverance, as though he had said, that they were acting foolishly, because they were thus hasty, for their expectation ought to have remained in suspense until the time prescribed, that is, till the end of the seventy years, according to what we have before seen, when the Prophet spoke against impostors who boasted of a quick return. He therefore tells them that they ought 			 patiently to bear their exile, until the full time of their deliverance came. And he points out the fountain or cause of their deliverance when he says, <i>I will have mercy on them, </i>as though he had said, that the very salvation whieh he promised to the people depended on his gratuitous mercy.</p>  <a name="v.xxi"></A>

<p><a name="v.xxi-p2"></A>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou settest before us daily, both in the heavens and on the earth, an illustrious example, not only of thy power and wisdom, but also of thy goodness and faithfulness, &#8212; O grant, that we may learn to raise up our thoughts still higher, even to that hope which is laid up for us in heaven, and that we may so suffer ourselves to be agitated by the various changes of this world, that yet our hope may remain fixed in thee, and 			 that whatever may happen, we may be fully persuaded that thou wilt be in such a way our Father, that we shall at length enjoy that blessed rest, which has been obtained for us by the blood of thine only-begotten Son. &#8212; Amen.</p>
