<span id="ii.iii-p1"></span>MATTHEW 21:28-32

<span id="ii.iii-p2"></span><span id="ii.iii-p2.1"></span>[Matthew
21:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#028)<span id="ii.iii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii-p3"></span>**28. **But what think you?  <span
id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28) A man had two sons, and, coming to the
first, he said, Son, go work today in my vineyard. **29. **And he
answering said, I will not;  <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29) but
afterwards he repented, and went. **30. **And coming to the other, he
spoke in the same manner. But he answering said, I \[go,\] Sir, and went
not. **31. **Which of the two did what his father wished?  <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30) And they say to him, The first. Jesus
saith to them, Verily I say to you, That the publicans and the harlots
will go before you into the kingdom of God. **32. **For John came to you
by the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but the
publicans and the harlots believed him. And you, when you had seen it,
were not moved by repentance  <span id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31) to
believe in him.

<span id="ii.iii-p8"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii-p9"></span><span id="ii.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii-p10"></span>This conclusion shows what is the object of
the parable, when Christ prefers to the scribes and priests those who
were generally accounted infamous and held in detestation; for he
unmasks those hypocrites,  <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32) that
they may no longer boast of being the ministers of God, or hold out a
pretended zeal for godliness. Though their ambition, and pride, and
cruelty, and avarice, were known to all, yet they wished to be reckoned
quite different persons. And when, but a little ago, they attacked
Christ, they falsely alleged that they were anxious about the order of
the Church, as if they were its faithful and honest guardians. Since
they attempt to practice such gross imposition on God and men, Christ
rebukes their impudence by showing that they were at the greatest
possible distance from what they boasted, and were so far from deserving
that elevation with which they flattered themselves, that they ranked
below *the publicans and the harlots* For as to the profession which
they made of being eminent in observing the worship of God, and of being
zealots of the Law, Christ tells them that it is quite as if *a son*
were, in words, to promise obedience to *his father,* but afterwards to
deceive him.  <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33) So far as regards
*the publicans and the harlots,* he does not excuse their vices, but
compares their dissolute life to the obstinacy of a rebellious and
debauched *son,* who at first throws off his father’s authority; but
shows that they are greatly preferable to the scribes and Pharisees in
this respect, that they do not continue to the end in their vices, but,
on the contrary, submit gently and obediently to the yoke which they had
fiercely rejected. We now perceive the design of Christ. Not only does
he reproach the priests and scribes with obstinately opposing God, and
not repenting, though so frequently admonished, but he strips them of
the honor of which they were unworthy, *because* their ungodliness was
worse than the lasciviousness of *the harlots.*

<span id="ii.iii-p13"></span><span id="ii.iii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii-p14"></span>**30.** *I, Sir.*  <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34) This phrase is borrowed from the Hebrew
language; for, when the Hebrews wish to offer their services, and to
declare that they are ready to obey, they speak in this manner, “Here I
am, Sir,” It is a laudable virtue in itself, as soon as God has spoken,
to yield to Him ready and cheerful obedience; and Christ does not here
give the commendation to slowness. But as both are improper—to delay
before doing your duty, and to promise what you do not perform—Christ
shows that this hypocrisy is less to be endured than the fierceness
which, in process of time, is subdued.

<span id="ii.iii-p16"></span><span id="ii.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii-p17"></span>**32.** *For John came.* As *John* was a
faithful servant of God, whatever he taught Christ ascribes to God
himself. It might have been more fully expressed thus: God came pointing
out *the way of righteousness* by the mouth of *John;* but as *John*
spoke in the name of God, and not as a private individual, he is most
properly named instead of God. Now this passage gives no small authority
to the preaching of the word, when those persons are said to have been
disobedient and rebellious against God, who despised the pious and holy
warnings of a teacher whom tie had sent.

<span id="ii.iii-p18"></span>There are some who give a more ingenious
exposition of the word *righteousness,* and I allow them to enjoy their
own opinion; but, for my own part, I think that it means nothing more
than that *John’s* doctrine was pure and right; as if Christ had said,
that they had no good reason for rejecting him. When he says that *the
publicans believed,* he does not mean that they assented in words, but
that they sincerely embraced what they had heard. Hence we infer, that
faith does not consist solely in a person’s giving his assent to true
doctrine, but that it embraces something greater and loftier, that the
hearer, renouncing himself, devotes his life wholly to God. By saying
that they were not moved even by such an example, he presents an
aggravated view of their malice; for it was an evidence of the lowest
depravity, not even to follow *the harlots and the publicans.*  <span
