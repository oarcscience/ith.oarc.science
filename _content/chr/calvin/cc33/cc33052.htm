For&#8212;as we have already had frequent opportunities of perceiving&#8212;it was not the intention of the Evangelists to embrace every part of the history; because the Holy Spirit, who guided their pen, has thought fit to compose such a summary as we see out of their united testimonies. Matthew has therefore selected what was of the greatest importance to us, namely, that when Christ appeared to the disciples, he likewise commissioned them to be apostles, to convey into every part of the world the 			 message of eternal life.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p9"></A><i>To the mountain where Jesus had appointed them. </i>Though <i>the mountain </i>is not mentioned any where else, yet we con-elude that this spot <i>in Galilee </i>was known to Mary.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_322"></A><A HREF="#fn_322"><FONT SIZE="1">323</FONT></A>

<p><a name="ii.li-p12"></A><b>17.</b><i> But some doubted. </i>It is wonderful that, after they had twice seen Christ, still <i>some doubted. </i>If any one choose to view this as referring to the first appearance, there will be no absurdity in that opinion; for the Evangelists are sometimes in the habit of blending a variety of 			 transactions. But neither would it have the appearance of absurdity to suppose that in some of them the remains of their former terror led them again into hesitation; for we know that, when Christ appeared, they were struck with fear and amazement, till they had recovered their minds and had become accustomed to his presence. The meaning, therefor appears to me to be, that <i>some </i>at first hesitated, until Christ made a nearer and more familiar 			 approach to them; but that when they certainly and absolutely recognized him, then <i>they worshipped, </i>because the splendor of his divine glory was manifest. And perhaps it was the same reason that suddenly caused them to <i>doubt, </i>and afterwards led them to <i>worship him; </i>namely, that he had laid aside the form of a servant, and had nothing in his 			 appearance but what was heavenly.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p13"></A><a name="ii.li-p13.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p14"></A><b>18.</b><i> And Jesus approached and spoke to them. </i>His <i>approach </i>unquestionably removed all hesitation. Before relating that the office of teaching was committed to the disciples, Matthew says that Christ began by speaking of his <i>power; </i>and not 			 without reason. For no ordinary authority would here have been enough, but sovereign and truly divine government ought to be possessed by him who commands them to promise eternal life in his ham to reduce the whole world under his sway, and to publish a doctrine which subdues all pride, and lays prostrate the whole of the human race. And by this preface Christ not only encouraged the Apostles to full confidence in the discharge of their office, but confirmed the faith of his gospel in all ages. 			 Never, certainly, would the Apostles have had sufficient confidence to undertake so arduous an office, if they had not known that their Protector sitteth in heaven, and that the highest <i>authority is given to him; </i>for without such a support it would have been impossible for them to make any progress. But when they learn that he to whom they owe their services is the Governor of heaven and earth, this alone was abundantly sufficient for preparing 			 them to rise superior to all opposition. As regards the hearers, if the contemptible appearance of those who preach the gospel weakens or retards their faith, let them learn to raise their eyes to the Master himself, by whose power the majesty of the Gospel ought to be estimated, and then they will not venture to despise him when speaking by his ministers.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p15"></A>He expressly calls himself the <i>Lord and King of heaven and earth, </i>because, by constraining men to obey him in the preaching of the gospel, he establishes his throne <i>on the earth; </i>and, by regenerating his people to a new life, and inviting them to the hope of salvation, he opens <i>heaven </i>to admit to a blessed immortality with angels those who formerly had not only crawled on the world, but had been plunged in the abyss of 			 death. Yet let us remember that what Christ possessed in his own right was given to him by the Father in our flesh, or&#8212;to express it more clearly&#8212;in the person of the Mediator; for he does not lay claim to the eternal power with which he was endued before the creation of the world, but to that which he has now received, by being appointed to be Judge of the world. Nay, more, it ought to be remarked, that this authority was not fully known until he rose from the dead; for then only did he come 			 forth adorned with the emblems of supreme King. To this also relate those words of Paul:</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ii.li-p16"></A>he emptied himself, (<a name="ii.li-p16.1"></A>&#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7952;&#954;&#8051;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#949;,) therefore God hath exalted him, and given to him a name which is above every other name, <br> 			 (<a name="ii.li-p16.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007">Phil. 2:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009">9</a><a name="ii.li-p16.3"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p17"></A>And though, in other passage the <i>sitting at the right hand of God </i>is placed after the ascension to heaven, as later in the order of time; yet as the resurrection and the ascension to heaven are closely connected with each other, with good reason does Christ now speak of his power in such magnificent terms.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p18"></A><a name="ii.li-p18.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p19"></A><b>19.</b> <i>Go out, therefore, and teach all nations. </i>Though Mark, after having related that Christ <i>appeared to the eleven disciples, </i>immediately subjoins 			 the command to <i>preach the gospel, </i>he does not speak of these as an unbroken series of events, for we learn from the enumeration of them which is given by Matthew, that the latter event did not take place before they had gone <i>into Galilee. </i>The meaning amounts to this, 			 that by proclaiming the gospel everywhere, they should bring <i>all nations </i>to the obedience of the faith, and next, that they should seal and ratify their doctrine by the sign of the gospel. In Matthew, they are first taught simply to <i>teach; </i>but Mark expresses the kind of doctrine, that they should <i>preach the gospel; 			 </i>and shortly afterwards Matthew himself adds this limitation, to <i>teach them to observe all things whatsoever the Lord hath commanded.</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p20"></A>Let us learn from this passage, that the apostleship is not an empty title, but a laborious office; and that, consequently, nothing is more absurd or intolerable than that this honor should be claimed by hypocrites, who live like kings at their ease, and disdainfully throw away from themselves the office of <i>teaching. </i>The Pope of Rome and his band proudly boast of their succession, as if they held this rank in common with Peter and his 			 companions; and yet they pay no more regard to doctrine than was paid by the <i>Luperci, </i>or the priests of <i>Bacchus </i>and <i>Venus.</i>  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_323"></A><A HREF="#fn_323"><FONT SIZE="1">324</FONT></A>
 			 And with what face, pray, do they claim to be the successors of those who, they are told, were appointed to be preachers of the gospel? But though they are not ashamed to display their impudence, still with every reader of sound judgment this single word is sufficient to lay prostrate their silly hierarchy&#8212;that no man can be a successor of the apostles who does not devote his services to Christ in the preaching of the gospel. In short, whoever does not fulfill the duties of a teacher 			 acts wickedly and falsely by assuming the name of an apostle; and what is more&#8212;the priesthood of the New Testament consists in slaying men, as a sacrifice to God, by the spiritual sword of the word. Hence it follows, that all are but pretended and spurious priests who are not devoted to the office of teaching.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p22"></A><i>Teach all nations. </i>Here Christ, by removing the distinction, makes the Gentiles equal to the Jews, and admits both, indiscriminately to a participation in the covenant. Such is also the import of the term: go <i>out; </i>for the prophets under the law had limits assigned to them, 			 but now,</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ii.li-p23"></A>the wall of partition having been broken down, <br> 			 (<a name="ii.li-p23.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014">Eph 2:14</a><a name="ii.li-p23.2"></A>,)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p24"></A>the Lord commands the ministers of the gospel to go to a distance, in order to spread the doctrine of salvation in every part of the world. For though, as we have lately suggested, the right of the first-born at the very commencement of the gospel, remained among the Jews, still the inheritance of life was common to the Gentiles. Thus was fulfilled that prediction of Isaiah, (<a name="ii.li-p24.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006">Isa 49:6</a><a name="ii.li-p24.1"></A>,) and others of a similar nature, that Christ was</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ii.li-p25"></A>given for a light of the Gentiles, <br> 			 that he might be the salvation of God to the end of the earth.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p26"></A><i> Mark </i>means the same thing by <i>every creature; </i>for when <i>peace </i>has been proclaimed to those that are within the Church, the same message reaches those who are <i>at 			 a distance, and were strangers, </i>(<a name="ii.li-p26.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017">Eph. 2:17</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019">19</a><a name="ii.li-p26.1"></A>.) How necessary it was that the apostles should be distinctly informed of the calling of the Gentiles, is evident from this consideration, that even after having received the command, they felt the greatest horror at 			 approaching them, as if by doing so they polluted themselves and their doctrine.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p27"></A><i>Baptizing them. </i>Christ enjoins that those who have submitted to the gospel, and professed to be his disciples, shall be <i>baptized; </i>partly that their <i>baptism </i>may be a pledge of eternal life before God:, and partly that it may be an outward sign of faith before men. 			 For we know that God testifies to us the grace of adoption by this sign, because he engrafts us into the body of his Son, so as to reckon us among his flock; and, therefore, not only our spiritual washing, by which he reconciles us to himself, but likewise our new righteousness, are represented by it. But as God, by this seal confirms to us his grace, so all who present themselves for <i>baptism </i>do, as it were, by their own signature, ratify their 			 faith. Now since this charge is expressly given to the apostles along with the preaching of the word, it follows that none can lawfully administer <i>baptism </i>but those who are also the ministers of doctrine. When private persons, and even women, are permitted to <i>baptize, </i>nothing can be more at variance with the ordinance of Christ, nor is it any thing else than a mere profanation. Besides, as 			 doctrine is placed first in order, this points out to us the true distinction between this mystery and the bastard rites of the Gentiles, by which they are initiated into their sacred mysteries; for the earthly element does not become a sacrament until God quickens it by his word. As superstition improperly counterfeits all the works of God, foolish men forge various sacraments at their pleasure; but as the word, which is the soul, is not in them, they are idle and unmeaning shadows. Let us 			 therefore hold that the power of the doctrine causes the signs to assume a new nature; as the outward working of the flesh begins to be the spiritual pledge of regeneration, when it is preceded by the doctrine of the gospel; and this is the true consecration instead of which, Popery has introduced to us the enchantments of sorcery.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p28"></A>Accordingly, it is said in Mark, <i>He that shall believe and be baptized shall be saved. </i>By these words Christ not only excludes from the hope of salvation hypocrites who, though destitute of faith, are puffed up only by the outward sign; but by a sacred bond he connects <i>baptism </i>with doctrine, so that the latter is nothing more than an appendage of the former. But as Christ enjoins them to <i>teach </i>before <i>baptizing, </i>and desires that none but <i>believers </i>shah be admitted to <i>baptism, </i>it would appear that <i>baptism </i>is not properly administered unless when it is preceded by faith. On this pretense, the <i>Anabaptists </i>have stormed greatly against infant baptism. But the reply is not difficult, if we attend to the reason of the command. Christ orders them to convey <i>to all nations </i>the message of eternal salvation, and confirms it by adding the seal of baptism. Now it 			 was proper that <i>faith </i>in the word should be placed before <i>baptism, </i>since the Gentiles were altogether alienated from God, and had nothing in common with the chosen people; for otherwise it would have been a false figure, which offered forgiveness and the gift of the Spirit to unbelievers, who were not yet members of Christ. But we know that by <i>faith </i>those who were formerly despised are united to the people of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p29"></A>It is now asked, on what condition does God adopt as children those who formerly were aliens? It cannot, indeed, be denied that, when he has once received them into his favor, he continues to bestow it on their children and their children&#8217;s children. By the coming of Christ God manifested himself as a Father equally to the Gentiles and to the Jews; and, therefore, that promise, which was formerly given to the Jews, must now be in force towards 			 the Gentiles,</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ii.li-p30"></A>I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed after thee, <br> 			 (<a name="ii.li-p30.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007">Ge 17:7</a><a name="ii.li-p30.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p31"></A>Thus we see that they who entered by faith into the Church of God are reckoned, along with their posterity, among the members of Christ, and, at the same time, called to the inheritance of salvation. And yet this does not involve the separation of <i>baptism </i>from faith and doctrine; because, 			 though infants are not yet of such an age as to be capable of receiving the grace of God by faith, still God, when addressing their parents, includes them also. I maintain, therefore, that it is not rash to administer baptism to infants, to which God invites them, when he promises that <i>he will be their God.</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p32"></A><i>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. </i>This passage shows that the full and clear knowledge of God, which had been but darkly shadowed out under <i>the Law and the Prophets, </i>is at length fully discovered under the reign of Christ. True, indeed, the ancients would never have ventured to 			 call God their <i>Father, </i>if they had not derived this assurance from Christ their Head; and the Eternal Wisdom of God, who is the fountain of light and life, was not wholly unknown to them. It was even one of their acknowledged principles, that God displays his power by <i>the Holy Spirit. </i>But at the commencement of the gospel God was far more clearly revealed in Three Persons; for then the Father 			 manifested himself in the Son, his lively and distinct image, while Christ, irradiating the world by the full splendor of his Spirit, held out to the knowledge of men both himself and the Spirit.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p33"></A>There are good reasons why <i>the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, </i>are expressly mentioned; for there is no other way in which the efficacy of <i>baptism </i>can be experienced than when we begin with the unmerited mercy of <i>the Father, </i>who 			 reconciles us to himself by the only begotten <i>Son; </i>next, Christ comes forward with the sacrifice of his death; and at length, <i>the Holy Spirit </i>is likewise added, by whom he washes and regenerates us, (<a name="ii.li-p33.1"></A>Titus 3:5,) and, in short, makes us partakers of his benefits. Thus we perceive that God cannot 			 be truly known, unless our faith distinctly conceive of Three Persons in one essence; and that the fruit and efficacy of <i>baptism </i>proceed from God <i>the Father </i>adopting us through his <i>Son, </i>and, after having cleansed us from the pollutions of the flesh through <i>the Spirit: </i>creating us anew to 			 righteousness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p34"></A><a name="ii.li-p34.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p35"></A><b><a name="ii.li-p35.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016">Mark 16:16</a><a name="ii.li-p35.2"></A></b> <i>He who shall believe and be baptized shall be saved. </i>This promise was added in order to allure all mankind to <i>believe; </i>as it is followed, on the other hand, by a threatening of awful destruction, in order to terrify 			 unbelievers. Nor is it wonderful that salvation is promised to <i>believers; </i>for, by <i>believing </i>in the only begotten Son of God, not only are they reckoned among the children of God, but receiving the gift of free justification and of the Spirit of regeneration, they possess what constitutes eternal life. <i>Baptism </i>is joined to the <i>faith </i>of the gospel, in order to inform us that the Mark of our salvation is engraved on it; for had it not served to testify the grace of God, it would have been improper in Christ to have said, that <i>they who shall believe and be baptized shall be saved. </i>Yet, at the same time, we must hold that it is not required as absolutely necessary to salvation, so that all who 			 have not obtained it must perish; for it is not added to faith, as if it were the half of the cause of our salvation, but as a testimony. I readily acknowledge that men are laid under the necessity of not despising the sign of the grace of God; but though God uses such aids in accommodation to the weakness of men, I deny that his grace is limited to them. In this way we will say that it is not necessary in itself, but only with respect to our obedience.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p36"></A><i>But he who shall not believe shall be condemned. </i>By this second clause in which Christ <i>condemns those who shall not believe, </i>he means that rebels, when they reject the salvation offered to them, draw down upon themselves severer punishment, and not only are involved in the general destruction of mankind, but bear 			 the guilt of their own ingratitude.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p37"></A><a name="ii.li-p37.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p38"></A><b>17</b> <i> And these signs shall follow them that shall believe. </i>As the Lord, while he still lived with men in the world, had ratified the faith of his gospel by miracles, so now he extends the same power to the future, lest the disciples should imagine that it could not be separated from his bodily presence. For it was 			 of very great importance that this divine power of Christ should continue to be exerted amongst <i>believers, </i>that it might be certainly known that he was risen from, the dead, and that thus his doctrine might remain unimpaired, and that his name might be immortal. When he says that <i>believers </i>will receive this gift, we 			 must not understand this as applying to every one of them; for we know that gifts were distributed variously, so that the power of working miracles was possessed by only a few persons. But as that which was bestowed on a few was common to the whole Church, and as the miracles performed by one individual served for the confirmation of all, Christ properly uses the word <i>believers </i>in an indefinite sense. The 			 meaning, therefore, is, that <i>believers </i>will be ministers of the same power which had formerly excited admiration in Christ, that during his absence the sealing of the gospel may be more fully ascertained, as he promises</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ii.li-p39"></A>that they will do the same things, and greater, <br> 			 (<a name="ii.li-p39.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#012">Joh 14:12</a><a name="ii.li-p39.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p40"></A>To testify the glory and the divinity of Christ, it was enough that a few of the <i>believers </i>should be endued with this power.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p41"></A>Though Christ does not expressly state whether he intends this gift to be temporary, or to remain perpetually in his Church, yet it is more probable that miracles were promised only for a time, in order to give luster to the gospel, while it was new and in a state of obscurity. It is possible, no doubt, that the world may have been deprived of this honor through the guilt of its own ingratitude; but I think that the true design for which 			 miracles were appointed was, that nothing which was necessary for proving the doctrine of the gospel should be wanting at its commencement. And certainly we see that the use of them ceased not long afterwards, or, at least, that instances of them were so rare as to entitle us to conclude that they would not be equally common in all ages.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p42"></A>Yet those who came after them, that they might not allow it to be supposed that they were entirely destitute of miracles, were led by foolish avarice or ambition to forge for themselves miracles which had no reality. Thus was the door opened for the impostures of Satan, not only that delusions might be substituted for truth, but that, under the pretense of miracles, the simple might be led aside from the true faith. And 			 certainly it was proper that men of eager curiosity, who, not satisfied with lawful proof, were every day asking new miracles, should be carried away by such impostures. This is the reason why Christ, in another passage, foretold that the reign of Antichrist would be full of <i>lying signs, </i>(<a name="ii.li-p42.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024">Mt 24:24</a><a name="ii.li-p42.1"></A>;) and Paul makes a similar declaration, (<a name="ii.li-p42.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009">2Th 2:9</a><a name="ii.li-p42.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p43"></A>That our faith may be duly confirmed by miracles, let our minds be kept within that moderation which I have mentioned. Hence, also, it follows that it is a silly calumny which is advanced by those who object against our doctrine, that it wants the aid of miracles; as if it were not the same doctrine which Christ long ago has abundantly sealed. But on this subject I use greater brevity, because I have already treated it more fully in many 			 passages.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p44"></A><a name="ii.li-p44.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p45"></A><b><a name="ii.li-p45.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020">Matthew 28:20</a><a name="ii.li-p45.2"></A>.</b> <i>Teaching them to observe all things. </i>By these words, as I have formerly suggested, Christ shows that, in sending the apostles, he does not entirely resign his office, as if he ceased to be the Teacher of his Church; for he sends away the apostles with this reservation, 			 that they shall not bring forward their own inventions, but shall purely and faithfully deliver from hand to hand (as we say) what he has entrusted to them. Would to God that the Pope would subject to this rule the power which he claims for himself; for we would easily permit him to be the successor of Peter or of Paul, provided that he did not usurp a tyrannical dominion over our souls. But as he has set aside the authority of Christ, and infects the Church with his childish fooleries, this 			 shows plainly enough how widely he has departed from the apostolic office. In short, let us hold that by these words teachers are appointed over the Church, not to put forward whatever they may think proper, but that they, as well as others, may depend on the mouth of the Master alone, so as to gain disciples for him, and not for themselves.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p46"></A><i>And, lo, I am with you always. </i>As Christ gave to the apostles a commission which they were unable to discharge by reliance on merely human power, he encourages them by the assurance of his heavenly protection. For before promising that he would be with them, he began with declaring that he is the, King <i>of heaven and earth, </i>who governs all things by his power and authority.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p47"></A>The pronoun <i>I</i> must be viewed as emphatic; as if he had said that the apostles, if they wished zealously to perform their duty, must not consider what they are able to do, but must rely on the invincible power of those under whose banner they fight. The nature of that presence which the Lord promises to his followers ought to be 			 understood spiritually; for it is not necessary that he should descend from heaven in order to assist us, since he can assist us by the grace of his Spirit, as if he stretched out his hand from heaven. For he who, in respect of his body, is at a great distance from us, not only diffuses the efficacy of his Spirit through the whole world, but even actually dwells in us.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p48"></A><i>Even to the end of the world. </i>It ought likewise to be remarked, that this was not spoken to the apostles alone; for the Lord promises his assistance not for a single age only, but <i>even to the end of the world. </i>It is as if he had said, that though the ministers of the gospel be weak and suffer the want of all 			 things: he will be their guardian, so that they will rise victorious over all the opposition of the world. In like manner, experience clearly shows in the present day, that the operations of Christ are carried on wonderfully in a secret manner, so that the gospel surmounts innumerable obstacles.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.li-p49"></A>So much the more intolerable is the wickedness of the Popish clergy, when they take this as a pretext for their sacrilege and tyranny. They affirm that the Church cannot err, because it is governed by Christ; as if Christ, like some private soldier, hired himself for wages to other captains, and as if he had not, on the contrary, reserved the entire authority for himself, and declared that he would defend his doctrine, so that his ministers 			 may confidently expect to be victorious over the whole world.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="ii.li-p21"></A> The God <i>Pan, </i>in honor of whom the grossest indecency was practiced at the festival of the <i>Lupercalia,</i> &#8212; <i>Bacchus, </i>the patron of drunkenness, &#8212; and <i>Venus, </i>the patroness of licentiousness, &#8212; recall to every one 				  who is familiar with classical literature the degraded state of morals into which Rome had sunk amidst the proudest triumphs of civilization. Ancient Heathenism, like the Braminism of modern Hindostan, offered a ready apology for every species of crime, and associated with the history of its gods, and with the most sacred duties of religion, scenes so utterly impure, and so much fitted to inflame the basest passions, that the bare recital of them would offend a modest ear. By the present 				  allusion, Calvin means something more than meets the eye, and reminds us that the Pope and his clergy not only &#8220;paid as little regard to Christian doctrine as the priests of Pan, and Bacchus, and Venus,&#8221; but that they too closely resembled them in the flagrant immorality of their lives. Above all, he points to the refinements of casuistry, the shocking disclosures of the confessional, and the profligacy of monastic life, in all of which, under 				  the cloak of religion, practices, <i>of which it is a shame even to speak, </i>(<a name="ii.li-p21.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#012">Eph 5:12</a><a name="ii.li-p21.1"></A>,) received the most direct encouragement. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>
