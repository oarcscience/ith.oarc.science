<p><a name="ii.vii-p5"></A><b>34.</b>&nbsp;But when the Pharisees heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they assembled together. <b>35.</b>&nbsp;And one of them, a doctor of the law, put a question to him, tempting him, and saying, <b>36.</b>&nbsp;Master, which is the great commandment in the law? <b>37.</b>&nbsp;Jesus saith to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. <b>38.</b>&nbsp;This is the 				  first and great commandment. <b>39.</b>&nbsp;And the second is like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as much as thyself. <b>40.</b>&nbsp;On these two commandments the whole law and the prophets depend.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.vii-p6"></A><b>28.</b>&nbsp;And when one of the scribes came, and heard them disputing together, and saw that he had answered them well, he put a question to him, Which is the first commandment of all? <b>29.</b>&nbsp;And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. <b>30.</b>&nbsp;And, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all 				  thy strength; this is the first commandment. <b>31.</b>&nbsp;And the second, which is like it, is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: there is no other commandment greater than these. <b>32.</b>&nbsp;And the scribe said to him, Master, thou hast answered well with truth, that there is one God, and there is no other besides him. <b>33.</b>&nbsp;And that to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his 				  neighbor as himself, is better than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices. <b>34.</b>&nbsp;And Jesus, when he saw that he had replied skillfully, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.&nbsp;And after that, no man ventured to put a question to him.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.vii-p7"></A><b>25.</b>&nbsp;And, lo, a certain lawyer  				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">71</FONT></A>
 				  rose up, tempting him, and saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? <b>26.</b>&nbsp;And he said to him, What is written in the law?

<p><a name="ii.vii-p11"></A>Although I think that this narrative has nothing more than a resemblance to what is related by Matthew in the 22nd, and by Mark in the 12th chapter, of his Gospel, and that they are not the same; I have chosen to collect them into one place, because, while Matthew and Mark affirm that this was the 			 last <i>question </i>by which our Lord was <i>tempted, </i>Luke makes no mention of that circumstance, and seems intentionally to leave it out, because he had stated it in another passage. And yet I do not dispute that it may be the same 			 narrative, though Luke has some things different from the other two. They all agree in this, that the <i>scribe </i>put a question for the sake of tempting Christ; but he who is described by Matthew and Mark goes away with no bad disposition; for he acquiesces in Christ&#8217;s reply, and shows a sign of a teachable and gentle mind: to which must be added, that Christ, on the other hand, declares that he 			 <i>is not far from the kingdom of God. </i>Luke, on the other hand, introduces a man who was obstinate and swelled with pride, in whom no evidence of repentance is discovered. Now there would be no absurdity in saying that Christ was repeatedly <i>tempted </i>on the subject of true righteousness, and of 			 keeping the Law, and of the rule of a good life. But whether Luke has related this out of its proper place, or whether he has now passed by the other question &#8212; because that former narrative relating to doctrine was sufficient &#8212; the similarity of the doctrine seemed to require me to compare the three Evangelists with each other.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p12"></A>Let us now see what was the occasion that led this <i>scribe </i>to put a question to Christ. It is because, being an expounder of the Law, he is offended at the doctrine of the gospel, by which he supposes the authority of Moses to be diminished. At the same time, he is not so much influenced by zeal for the Law, as by displeasure at losing 			 some part of the honor of his teaching. He therefore inquires at Christ, if he wishes to profess any thing more perfect than the Law; for, though he does not say this in words, yet his question is ensnaring, for the purpose of exposing Christ to the hatred of the people. Matthew and Mark do not attribute this stratagem to one man only, but show that it was done by mutual arrangement, and that out of the whole sect one person was chosen who was thought to excel the rest in ability and learning. 			 In the form of the question, too, Luke differs somewhat from Matthew and Mark; for, according to him, the <i>scribe </i>inquires <i>what </i>men <i>must do to obtain eternal life, </i>but according 			 to the other two Evangelists, he inquires <i>what is the chief commandment in the law. </i>But the design is the same, for he makes a deceitful attack on Christ, that, if he can draw any thing from his lips that is at variance with <i>the law, </i>he may exclaim against him as an apostate and a promoter of ungodly 			 revolt.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p13"></A><a name="ii.vii-p13.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p14"></A><b><a name="ii.vii-p14.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#026">Luke 10:26</a><a name="ii.vii-p14.2"></A>.</b> <i>What is written in the law? </i>He receives from Christ a reply different from what he had expected. And, indeed, no other rule of a holy and righteous life was prescribed by Christ than what had been laid down by the Law of Moses; for the perfect love of God and of our 			 neighbors comprehends the utmost perfection of righteousness. Yet it must be observed, that Christ speaks here about obtaining salvation, in agreement with the question which had been put to him; for he does not teach absolutely, as in other passages, how men may arrive at eternal life, but how they ought to live, in order to be accounted righteous in the sight of God. Now it is certain that in the Law there is prescribed to men a rule by which they ought to regulate their life, so as to obtain 			 salvation in the sight of God. That the Law can do nothing else than condemn, and is therefore called the doctrine of death, and is said by Paul to increase transgressions, (<a name="ii.vii-p14.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013">Ro 7:13</a><a name="ii.vii-p14.3"></A>,) arises not from any fault of its doctrine, but because it is impossible for us to perform what it enjoins. Therefore, though no man is justified by the Law yet the Law itself contains the highest 			 righteousness, because it does not falsely hold out salvation to its followers, if any one fully observed all that it commands.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">72</FONT></A>
 			  Nor ought we to look upon this as a strange manner of teaching, that God first demands the righteousness of works, and next offers a gratuitous righteousness without works; for it is necessary that men should be convinced of their righteous condemnation, that they may betake themselves to the mercy of God. Accordingly, Paul (<a name="ii.vii-p15.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005">Rom. 10:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006">6</a><a name="ii.vii-p15.2"></A>) 			 compares both kinds of <i>righteousness, </i>in order to inform us that the reason why we are freely justified by God is, that we have no righteousness of our own. Now Christ in this reply accommodated himself to the <i>lawyer, </i>and attended to the nature of his <i>question; 			 </i>for he had inquired not how salvation must be sought, but by what works it must be obtained.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p16"></A><a name="ii.vii-p16.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p17"></A><b><a name="ii.vii-p17.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037">Matthew 22:37</a><a name="ii.vii-p17.2"></A>.</b> <i>Thou shalt love the Lord thou God. </i>According to Mark, the preface is inserted, that <i>Jehovah alone is the God of Israel;</i> 			 by which words God supports the authority of his law in two ways. For, first, it ought to be a powerful excitement to the worship of God, when we are fully convinced that we worship the actual Creator of heaven and earth, because indifference is naturally produced by doubt; and, secondly, because it is a pleasing inducement to <i>love 			 </i>him, when he freely adopts us as his people. So then, that they may not hesitate, as usually happens in cases of uncertainty, the Jews are informed that the rule of life is prescribed to them by the true and only God; and, on the other hand, that they may not be kept back by distrust, God approaches to them in a familiar manner, and reminds them of his gracious covenant with them. And yet there is no reason to doubt that the Lord distinguishes himself from 			 all idols, that the Jews may not be drawn aside from him, but may adhere to the pure worship of God himself. Now if uncertainty does not keep back the wretched worshippers of idols from being carried away to the love of them by impetuous zeal, what excuse is left for the hearers of the Law, if they remain indifferent, after that God has revealed himself to them?</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p18"></A>What follows is an abridgment of the Law,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A>
 			  which is also found in the writings of Moses, (<a name="ii.vii-p19.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005">De 6:5</a><a name="ii.vii-p19.2"></A>.) For, though it is divided into two tables, the first of which relates to the worship of God, and the second to charity, Moses properly and wisely draws up this summary,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">74</FONT></A>
 			  that the Jews may perceive what is the will of God in each of the commandments. And although we ought to love God far more than men, yet most properly does God, instead of worship or honor, require <i>love </i>from us, because in this way he declares that no other worship is pleasing to Him than what is voluntary; for no man will actually obey God but he who <i>loves </i>Him. But as the wicked and sinful inclinations of the flesh draw us aside from what is right, Moses shows that our life will not be regulated aright till the <i>love</i> of God fill all our senses. Let us therefore learn, that the commencement of godliness is the <i>love </i>of God, because God disdains the forced services of men, and chooses to be worshipped freely and willingly; and let us also learn, that under the <i>love </i>of God is included the reverence due to him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p21"></A>Moses does not add the <i>mind, </i>but mentions only the <i>heart, </i>and the <i>soul, </i>and the <i>strength; </i>and though the present division into four clauses is more full, yet it does not alter the sense. For while Moses intends to teach generally that God ought to be perfectly <i>loved, </i>and that whatever powers belong to men ought to be devoted to this object, he reckoned it enough, after mentioning the <i>soul </i>and the <i>heart, </i>to add the <i>strength, </i>that he might not leave any part of us uninfluenced by the <i>love </i>of God; and we know also that under the word <i>heart </i>the Hebrews sometimes include the <i>mind,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">75</FONT></A>
 			  particularly when it is joined to the word <i>soul </i>What is the difference between the <i>mind </i>and the heart, both in this passage and in Matthew, I do not trouble myself to 			 inquire, except that I consider the <i>mind </i>to denote the loftier abode of reason, from which all our thoughts and deliberations flow.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p23"></A>It now appears from this summary that, in the commandments of the Law, God does not look at what men can do, but at what they ought to do; since in this infirmity of the flesh it is impossible that perfect <i>love </i>can obtain dominion, for we know how strongly all the senses of our soul are disposed to vanity. Lastly, we learn from this, 			 that God does not rest satisfied with the outward appearance of works, but chiefly demands the inward feelings, that from a good root good fruits may grow.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p24"></A><a name="ii.vii-p24.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p25"></A><b>39.</b> <i>And the second is like it. </i>He assigns the <i>second </i>place to mutual kindness among men, for the worship of God is <i>first</i> in order. The <i>commandment </i>to love our neighbors, he tells us, is <i>like </i>the first, because it depends upon it. For, since every man is devoted to himself, there will never be true charity towards <i>neighbors, 			 </i>unless where the love of God reigns; for it is a mercenary love   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">76</FONT></A>
 			  which the children of the world entertain for each other, because every one of them has regard to his own advantage. On the other hand, it is impossible for the love of God to reign without producing brotherly kindness among men.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p27"></A>Again, when Moses commanded us to love our neighbors as ourselves, he did not intend to put the <i>love </i>of <i>ourselves </i>in the first place, so that a man may first love <i>himself 			 </i>and then love his <i>neighbors; </i>as the sophists of the <i>Sorbonne</i> are wont to cavil, that a rule must always go before what it regulates. But as we are too much devoted to ourselves, Moses, in correcting this fault, places our neighbors in an equal rank with 			 us; thus forbidding every man to pay so much attention to himself as to disregard others, because kindness unites all in one body. And by correcting the <i>self-love </i>(<a name="ii.vii-p27.3"></A>&#966;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8055;&#945;&#957;) which separates some persons from others, he brings each of them into a common union, 			 and&#8212;as it were&#8212;into a mutual embrace. Hence we conclude, that charity is justly pronounced by Paul to be</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ii.vii-p28"></A>the bond of perfection, (<a name="ii.vii-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014">Col 3:14</a><a name="ii.vii-p28.1"></A>,)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p29"></A>and, in another passage, the</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ii.vii-p30"></A>fulfilling of the law, (<a name="ii.vii-p30.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010">Ro 13:10</a><a name="ii.vii-p30.1"></A>;)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p31"></A>for all the commandments of the second table must be referred to it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p32"></A><a name="ii.vii-p32.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p33"></A><b><a name="ii.vii-p33.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#028">Luke 10:28</a><a name="ii.vii-p33.2"></A>.</b> <i>Do this, and thou shalt live. </i>I have explained a little before, how this promise agrees with freely bestowed justification by faith; for the reason why God justifies us freely is, not that the Law does not point out perfect righteousness, but because we fail in keeping 			 it, and the reason why it is declared to be impossible for us to obtain life by it is, that</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ii.vii-p34"></A>it is weak through our flesh, (<a name="ii.vii-p34.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003">Ro 8:3</a><a name="ii.vii-p34.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p35"></A>So then these two statements are perfectly consistent with each other, that the Law teaches how men may obtain righteousness by works, and yet that no man is justified by works, because the fault lies not in the doctrine of the Law, but in men. It was the intention of Christ, in the meantime, to vindicate himself from the calumny which, he knew, was brought against him by the unlearned and ignorant, that he set aside the Law, so far as it is 			 a perpetual rule of righteousness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p36"></A><a name="ii.vii-p36.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p37"></A><b>29. </b><i>But he wishing to justify himself. </i>This question might appear to be of no importance for <i>justifying </i>a man. But if we recollect what was formerly stated, that the hypocrisy of men is elderly detected by means of the second table&#8212;for, while 			 they pretend to be eminent worshippers of God, they openly violate charity towards their neighbors&#8212;it will be easy to infer from this, that the Pharisee practiced this evasion, in order that, concealed under the false mask of holiness, he might not be brought forth to light. So then, aware that the test of charity would prove unfavorable to him, he seeks concealment under the word <i>neighbor, </i>that he may 			 not be discovered to be a transgressor of the Law. But we have already seen, that on this subject the Law was corrupted by the scribes, because they reckoned none to be their <i>neighbors </i>but those who were worthy of it. Hence, too, this principle was received among them, that we have a right to <i>hate our enemies, </i>(<a name="ii.vii-p37.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#043">Mt 5:43</a><a name="ii.vii-p37.1"></A>.) For the only method to which hypocrites can resort for avoiding the condemnation of themselves, is to turn away as far as they are able, that their life may not be tried by the judgment of the Law.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p38"></A><a name="ii.vii-p38.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p39"></A><b>30.</b> <i>And Jesus answering said. </i>Christ might have stated simply, that the word <i>neighbor </i>extends indiscriminately to every man, because the whole human race is united by a sacred bond of fellowship. And, indeed, the Lord 			 employed this word in the Law, for no other reason than to draw us sweetly to mutual kindness. The commandment would have run more clearly thus: <i>Love every man as thyself. </i>But as men are blinded by their pride, so that every man is satisfied with himself, scarcely deigns to admit others to an equal rank, and withholds from them the duties he owes them, the Lord purposely declares that all are 			 <i>neighbors </i>that the very relationship may produce mutual love. To make any person our <i>neighbor, </i>therefore, it is enough that he be, a man; for it is not in our power to blot out our common nature.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p40"></A>But Christ intended to draw the reply from the Pharisee, that he might condemn himself. For in consequence of the authoritative decision being generally received among them, that no man is our <i>neighbor </i>unless he is our friend, if Christ had put a direct question to him, he would never have made an explicit acknowledgment, that under 			 the word <i>neighbor</i> all men are included, which the comparison brought forward forces him to confess. The general truth conveyed is, that the greatest stranger is <i>our neighbor, </i>because God has bound all men together, for the purpose of assisting each other. He glances briefly, however, at the Jews, and especially at 			 the priests; because, while they boasted of being the children of the same Father, and of being separated by the privilege of adoption from the rest of the nations, so as to be God&#8217;s sacred heritage, yet, with barbarous and unfeeling contempt, they despised each other, as if no relationship had subsisted between them. For there is no doubt that Christ describes the cruel neglect of brotherly kindness, with which they knew that they were chargeable. But here, as I have said, the chief design is 			 to show that the <i>neighborhood, </i>which lays us under obligation to mutual offices of kindness, is not confined to friends or relatives, but extends to the whole human race.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p41"></A>To prove this, Christ compares <i>a Samaritan </i>to <i>a priest </i>and <i>a Levite. </i>It is well known what deadly hatred the Jews bore to the <i>Samaritans, </i>so that, notwithstanding their living close beside them, they were always at the greatest variance. Christ now says, that a Jew, an inhabitant of <i>Jericho, </i>on his journey <i>from Jerusalem, </i>having been wounded by <i>robbers, </i>received no assistance either from <i>a Levite or from a priest, </i>both of whom met with him lying on the road, and <i>half-dead, </i>but that a <i>Samaritan </i>showed him great kindness, and then asks, <i>Which of these three was neighbor </i>to the Jew? This subtle doctor could not escape from preferring the <i>Samaritan </i>to the other two. For here, as in a mirror, we behold that common relationship of men, which the scribes endeavored to blot out by their wicked 			 sophistry;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">77</FONT></A>
 			  and the <i>compassion, </i>which an enemy showed to a Jew, demonstrates that the guidance and teaching of nature are sufficient to show that man was created for the sake of man. Hence it is inferred that there is a mutual obligation between all men.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p43"></A>The allegory which is here contrived by the advocates of free will is too absurd to deserve refutation. According to them, under the figure of a wounded man is described the condition of Adam after the fall; from which they infer that the power of acting well was not wholly extinguished in him; because he is said to be only <i>half-dead. </i>As if it had been the design of Christ, in this passage, to speak of the corruption of human nature, and to inquire whether the wound which Satan inflicted on Adam were deadly or curable; nay, as if he had not plainly, and without a figure, declared in another passage, that all are <i>dead, </i>but those whom he quickens by <i>his voice, 			 </i>(<a name="ii.vii-p43.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025">Joh 5:25</a><a name="ii.vii-p43.1"></A>.) As little plausibility belongs to another allegory, which, however, has been so highly satisfactory, that it has been admitted by almost universal consent, as if it had been a revelation from heaven. This <i>Samaritan </i>they imagine to be Christ, because he is our guardian; and they tell us that <i>wine was poured, </i>along with <i>oil, </i>into the wound, because Christ cures us by repentance and by a promise of grace. They have contrived a third subtlety, that Christ does not 			 immediately restore health, but sends us to the Church, as <i>an innkeeper, </i>to be gradually cured. I acknowledge that I have no liking for any of these interpretations; but we ought to have a deeper reverence for Scripture than to reckon ourselves at liberty to disguise its natural meaning. And, indeed, any one may see that the curiosity of certain men has led them to contrive these speculations, contrary to 			 the intention of Christ.</p>

 			  all the doctrine of Scripture, but because all that is anywhere taught as to the manner of living a holy and righteous life must be referred to these two leading points. For Christ does not treat generally of what <i>the Law and the Prophets </i>contain, but, in drawing up his reply, states that nothing else is required in <i>the Law 			 and the prophets </i>than that every man should <i>love God </i>and his <i>neighbors; </i>as if he had said, that the sum of a holy and upright life consists in the worship of God and in charity to men, as Paul states that charity is</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ii.vii-p47"></A>the fulfilling of the law, (<a name="ii.vii-p47.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010">Ro 13:10</a><a name="ii.vii-p47.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p48"></A>And therefore some ill-informed persons are mistaken in interpreting this saying of Christ, as if we ought to seek nothing higher in <i>the Law and the Prophets. </i>For as a distinction ought to be made between the promises and the commandments, so in this passage Christ does not state generally what we ought to learn from the word of God, 			 but explains, in a manner suited to the occasion, the end to which all the commandments are directed. Yet the free forgiveness of sins, by which we are reconciled to God, &#8212; confidence in calling on God, which is the earnest of the future inheritance, &#8212; and all the other parts of faith, though they hold the first rank in the Law, do not <i>depend on these two commandments;</i> for it is 			 one thing to demand what we owe, and another thing to offer what we do not possess. The same thing is expressed in other words by Mark, that <i>there is no other commandment greater than these.</i></p>

<p><a name="ii.vii-p50"></A><b><a name="ii.vii-p50.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#032">Mark 12:32</a><a name="ii.vii-p50.2"></A>.</b> <i>Master, thou hast spoken well, and with truth. Mark </i>alone mentions that the <i>scribe </i>was softened down; and it is worthy of notice that, though he had attacked Christ maliciously, and 			 with the intention of taking him by surprise, not only does he silently yield to the latter, but openly and candidly assents to what Christ had said. Thus we see that he did not belong to the class of those enemies whose obstinacy is incurable; for, though they have been a hundred times convinced, yet they do not cease to oppose the truth in some manner. From this reply it may also be concluded, that Christ did not precisely include under these two words the rule of life, but embraced the 			 opportunity which presented itself for reproving the false and hypocritical holiness of the scribes, who, giving their whole attention to outward ceremonies, almost entirely disregarded the spiritual worship of God, and cared little about brotherly kindness. Now though the scribe was infected by such corruptions, yet, as sometimes happens, he had obtained from the Law the seed of right knowledge, which lay choked in his heart, and on that account he easily allows himself to be withdrawn from 			 the wicked custom.</p>

<p><a name="ii.vii-p52"></A><b>33.</b> <i>Is better than all burnt-offerings and sacrifices. </i>But it appears to be incongruous that <i>sacrifices, </i>which are a part of divine worship, and belong to the first table of the Law, should be reckoned of less importance 			 than charity towards men. The reply is, Though the worship of God is greatly preferable, and is more valuable than all the duties of a holy life, yet its outward exercises ought not to be estimated so highly as to swallow up brotherly kindness. For we know that brotherly kindness, in itself and simply, is pleasing to God, though <i>sacrifices </i>are not regarded by him with delight or approbation, except with a 			 view to another object. Besides, it is naked and empty <i>sacrifices </i>that are here spoken of; for our Lord contrasts a hypocritical appearance of piety with true and sincere uprightness. The same doctrine is to be found very frequently in the prophets, that hypocrites may know that <i>sacrifices </i>are of no value, unless 			 spiritual truth be joined to them, and that God is not appeased by offerings of beasts, where brotherly kindness is neglected.</p>

<p><a name="ii.vii-p54"></A><b>34.</b> <i>But when Jesus saw. </i>Whether this <i>scribe </i>made any farther progress is uncertain; but as he had shown himself to be teachable, Christ stretches out the hand to him, and teaches us, by his example, that we ought to 			 assist those in whom there is any beginning either of docility or of right understanding. There appear to have been two reasons why Christ declared that this scribe <i>was not far from the kingdom of God. </i>It was because he was easily persuaded to do his duty, and because he skillfully distinguished the outward worship of God from necessary duties. Nor was it so much with the design of praising as of 			 exhorting him, that Christ declared that <i>he was near the kingdom of God; </i>and in his person Christ encourages us all, after having once entered into the right path, to proceed with so much the greater cheerfulness. By these words we are also taught that many, while they are still held and involved in error, advance with closed eyes towards the road, and in this manner are prepared for running in the course 			 of the Lord, when the time arrives.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.vii-p55"></A><i>And after that, no man ventured to put a question to him. </i>The assertion of the Evangelists, that the mouth of adversaries was stopped, so they <i>did not venture </i>any more to lay snares for Christ, must not be so understood as if&#8217; they desisted from their wicked obstinacy; 			 for they groaned within, like wild beasts shut up in their dens, or, like unruly horses, they bit the bridle. But the more hardened their obstinacy, and the more incorrigible their rebellion, so much the more illustrious was Christ&#8217;s triumph over both. And this victory, which he obtained, ought greatly to encourage us never to become dispirited in the defense of the truth, being assured of success. It will often happen, indeed, that enemies shall molest and insult us till the end, but God will 			 at length secure that their fury shall recoil on their own heads, and that, in spite of their efforts, truth shall be victorious.</p>
