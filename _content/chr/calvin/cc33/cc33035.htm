But Caiaphas triumphs over him on account of his silence, as if he was struck dumb by being vanquished; which is usually the case with men who are conscious of having done wrong. But it is an instance of extreme wickedness that he 			 insinuates that Christ is not free from blame, because <i>witnesses </i>speak against him. The question, <i>What is it that those men testify against thee? </i>amounts to this: &#8220;How comes it that those men oppose thee, but because they are urged by conscientious views? For they would not have appeared against thee without a 			 good reason.&#8221; As if he did not know that those <i>witnesses </i>had been procured by fraud: but this is the way in which wicked men, when they find themselves in the possession of authority and power, throw off sham and indulge in arrogance. Christ was again silent, not only because the objection was frivolous, but because, having been appointed to be a sacrifice, he had thrown aside all anxiety about 			 defending himself.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxxiv-p16"></A><a name="ii.xxxiv-p16.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxxiv-p17"></A><b>63.</b> <i>I</i> <i>adjure thee by the living God. The high priest </i>thought that this alone was a crime sufficient to condemn Christ, if he professed that he was <i>the Christ. </i>But since they all boasted of expecting redemption from Christ, he ought first to have inquired if such was the fact. That there would be a <i>Christ, </i>by whose hands the people were to be delivered, they would not have ventured to deny. Jesus came publicly forward, bearing the title of <i>the Christ. </i>Why do they not consider the fact itself? Why do they not examine the signs, by means of which a correct decision might have been formed? But, having already determined to put Christ to death, they are satisfied with this pretense of sacrilege, that he claimed for himself the glory of Divinity. And yet Caiaphas examines the matter on oath, as if he had been prepared to yield as soon as it was fully 			 ascertained; but all the while his whole mind is filled with a malicious hatred and contempt of Christ, and is so blinded by pride and ambition, that he takes for granted, that as soon as the fact has been ascertained, without inquiring whether it is right or wrong, he will have just grounds for condemning him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxxiv-p18"></A><i>If thou art the Christ, the Son of God. </i>From the words of Caiaphas we may infer, that it was at that time common among the Jews to bestow on the Messiah the title of <i>the Son of God; </i>for this form of interrogation could not have originated in any other way than from 			 the ordinary custom; and, indeed, they had learned from the predictions of Scripture that he was not less <i>the Son of God </i>than <i>the Son of David. </i>It appears, too, that Caiaphas employed this epithet, with the view either of terrifying Christ, or of exciting a prejudice against him; as if he had said, &#8220;See where 			 you are going; for you cannot call yourself <i>the Christ, </i>without claiming, at the same time, the appellation of <i>Son of God, </i>with which Scripture honors him.&#8221; Such is also his reason for using the word <i>Blessed, </i>which Mark 			 gives instead of <i>God; </i>for this pretended reverence   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_231"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">232</FONT></A>
 			  for God was intended to bring a heavier charge against Christ than that of profaning the holy name of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxxiv-p20"></A><a name="ii.xxxiv-p20.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxxiv-p21"></A><b>64.</b> <i>Thou hast said it. </i>Luke inserts another reply, by which Christ reproves the malice of the priests, in not inquiring with a desire to know. <i>If I tell you, </i>says he, <i>you will not believe: </i>by which words he means, that though he were to prove to them a hundred times that he was <i>the Christ, </i>it would be of no avail with obstinate men. For they had not only heard, but had beheld with their eyes miracles, 			 which, though Christ had been silent, would have confirmed his heavenly and divine power, and would even have cried aloud, that he was the promised Redeemer.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxxiv-p22"></A>He next adds a confession, which, though it is related in many words by Matthew, does not convey a different meaning. Jesus affirms that he is <i>the Christ, </i>not for the purpose of avoiding death, but rather of inflaming the rage of his enemies against him. Though at that time he was 			 exposed to contempt, and almost annihilated, by his mean garb, he announces, that at the proper time he will at length come with royal majesty, that they may tremble before the Judge, whom they now refuse to acknowledge as the Author of salvation. The meaning therefore is, that they are widely mistaken, if from his present appearance they form a judgment of what he is; because it is necessary that he should be humbled, and almost reduced to nothing, before he appear adorned with the emblems of 			 his royal power, and with magnificent splendor. For by this word <i>hereafter </i>he distinguishes between his first and second coming.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxxiv-p23"></A>We may draw from this a useful doctrine, which is still more extensive. For how comes it that wicked men are so much at their ease? How comes it that they are so insolent in rebellion, but because they do not set a high value on the crucified Jesus? It is therefore necessary to remind them of a dreadful judgment, which, with all their stupidity, they will not be able to avoid. And though they ridicule as a fable what is 			 said about the future coming of Christ, still it is not in vain that the Judge summons them to his tribunal and orders them to be summoned by the preaching of the Gospel, that they may be rendered the more inexcusable. But this announcement is fitted to be of very great use even to believers, that they may now with the eyes of hope look for Christ <i>sitting at the right hand of the father, </i>and patiently 			 wait till he comes, and may likewise believe that the rage of wicked men against him, while absent, will not be without its consequences; for they will be compelled to behold him on high <i>coming from heaven, </i>whom now they not only despise, but even trample upon in their pride.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxxiv-p24"></A><i>Sitting at the right hand of power. </i>The metaphor contained in the term <i>right hand </i>must be well known, for it frequently occurs in Scripture. Christ then sits <i>at the right hand </i>of the Father, because he is his deputy; and it is called <i>the right hand </i>or power, a, because it is only through the agency of his Son that God now displays his <i>power, </i>and will execute judgment at the last day.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxxiv-p25"></A><a name="ii.xxxiv-p25.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxxiv-p26"></A><b>65.</b> <i>Then the high priest rent his garments. </i>By this we see how little advantage was derived by wicked men from the miracles by which Christ had proved his Divinity. But we need not wonder, that under the mean garb of a servant, the Son of God was despised by those who were 			 unmoved by any anxiety about the promised salvation. For if they had not entirely laid aside every pious feeling, their deplorable condition ought to have led them to look anxiously for the Redeemer; but when they now, without making any inquiry, reject him when offered to them, do they not as far as lies in their power, destroy all the promises of God? <i>The high priest </i>first pronounces Christ to be a 			 blasphemer, to which the others afterwards assent. The <i>rending of the clothes </i>plainly shows how boldly and wickedly those who profanely despise God make false pretensions of zeal. It would indeed have been praiseworthy in <i>the high priest, </i>if he heard the name of God shamefully profaned, not only to feel inward 			 resentment and excruciating pain, but to make an open display of his detestation; but while he refused to make inquiry, he contrived an unfounded charge of <i>blasphemy. </i>And yet, this treacherous hypocrite, while he assumed a character which did not belong to him, taught the servants of God with what severity of displeasure they ought to regard blasphemies, and condemned by his example the shameful 			 cowardice of those who are no more affected by an outrage on religion, than if they heard buffoons uttering their silly jokes.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxxiv-p27"></A><i>Then they spat in his face. </i>Either Luke has inverted the order of the narrative, or our Lord twice endured this highly contemptuous treatment. The latter supposition appears to me to be probable. And yet, I have no doubt that the servants were emboldened to <i>spit </i>on 			 Christ, and to <i>strike </i>him with greater insolence, after they had seen that the council, so far as their decision had influence, condemned him to death. The object of all these expressions of contempt was, to show that nothing was more unlikely than that he should be a prince of prophets, who, in consequence of being blindfolded,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_232"><FONT SIZE="1">233</FONT></A>
 			  was not able even to ward off <i>blows. </i>But this insolence was turned by the providence of God to a very different purpose; for the face of Christ, dishonored by <i>spitting </i>and <i>blows, </i>has restored 			 to us that image which had been disfigured, and almost effaced, by sin.</p>
