<p><a name="ii.xxii-p6"></A>Though this exhortation &#8212; as will appear from the conclusion of it&#8212;has nearly the same object with the former, yet it is properly added, in order to confirm believers in perseverance. Our Lord knew how strongly the nature of men is inclined to idleness, and how, for the most part, they not only grow weary after a great lapse of time, but give way through sudden dislike. To remedy this disease, he taught his disciples that 			 they were not duly fortified, unless they had sufficient perseverance for a long period. When this is ascertained to be the design of the parable, we ought not to trouble ourselves much with minute investigations, which have nothing to do with what Christ intended. Some people give themselves a good deal of uneasiness about <i>the lamps, the vessels, and the oil; </i>but the plain and natural meaning of the 			 whole is, that it is not enough to have ardent zeal for a short time, if we have not also a constancy that never tires. And Christ employs a very appropriate parable to express this. A little before, he had exhorted the disciples, that as they had a journey to perform through dark and dreary places, they should provide themselves with <i>lamps; </i>but as the wick of the lamp, if it be not supplied with oil, 			 gradually dries up, and loses its brightness, Christ now says, that believers need to have incessant supplies of courage, to support the flame which is kindled in their hearts, otherwise their zeal will fail ere they have completed the journey.</p>

He employs this remarkable title, that believers may not deceive themselves by an erroneous opinion that they have arrived at absolute 			 perfection. The parable is borrowed from the ordinary custom of life; for it was a childish speculation of <i>Jerome </i>and others, to adduce this passage in praise of <i>virginity; </i>while Christ had no other object in view than to lessen the uneasiness which they might be apt to feel in consequence of the delay of his 			 coming. He says, therefore, that he asks nothing more from us than is usually done for friends at a marriage-feast. The custom was, that <i>virgins, </i>who are tender and delicate&#8212;should, by way of respect, accompany <i>the bridegroom </i>to his chamber. But the general instruction of the parable consists in this, that it is not 			 enough to have been once ready and prepared for the discharge of duty, if we do not persevere to the end.</p>

<p><a name="ii.xxii-p10"></A><b>2.</b><i> Five were wise. </i>Towards the close of the former chapter, our Lord specially required <i>steward </i>to be <i>wise,</i> (<a name="ii.xxii-p10.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#045">Mt 24:45</a><a name="ii.xxii-p10.1"></A>) for it is reasonable, that the heavier the charge which any man sustains, and the more important the matters in which he is employed, the <i>wisdom </i>with which he conducts himself should be the greater. But now he demands <i>wisdom 			 </i>from all the children of God in general, that they may not, through inconsiderate rashness, expose themselves to be the prey of Satan. Now this kind of <i>wisdom </i>he describes by saying, that they are to provide themselves with the supplies necessary for completing the course of their life. For the warmth of our impatience makes us look upon the time, however short, as 			 far too long protracted; and next, our poverty is such, that we need supplies for every hour.</p>

<p><a name="ii.xxii-p12"></A><b>5.</b><i> And while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. </i>Some interpret this slumbering in a bad sense, as if believers, along with others, abandoned themselves to sloth, and were asleep amidst the vanities of the world; but this is altogether inconsistent with the intention of Christ, and with the structure of the parable. 			 There would be greater probability in explaining it to denote death, which overtakes believers before the coming of Christ; for it is not at that time only that we must look for salvation, but also when we have left the world and are sleeping in Christ. But I take it more simply as denoting earthly occupations, in which believers must be engaged, so long as they dwell in the body; and, though forgetfulness of the kingdom of God ought never to steal upon them, yet the distracting influence of 			 the occupations of this world is not inappropriately compared to <i>sleep. </i>For they cannot be so constantly occupied with the thought of meeting Christ, as not to be distracted, or retarded, or entangled by a variety of cares, in consequence of which, while they watch, they are partly asleep.</p>

<p><a name="ii.xxii-p14"></A><b>6.</b><i> At midnight a cry arose. </i>With respect to the <i>cry </i>I view it as taken metaphorically for his sudden arrival; for we know, that when any thing new and 			 unexpected happens, men are wont to make a loud noise. True, indeed, our Lord <i>cries </i>daily, that <i>he will come quickly, </i>(<a name="ii.xxii-p14.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020">Re 22:20</a><a name="ii.xxii-p14.1"></A>;) but at that, time, the whole frame of 			 the world will resound with the <i>cry, </i>and his dreadful majesty will fill heaven and earth in such a manner, as not only to awaken those who are <i>asleep, </i>but to bring the dead <i>out of their graves, </i>(<a name="ii.xxii-p14.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028">Joh 5:28</a><a name="ii.xxii-p14.2"></A>.)</p>

<p><a name="ii.xxii-p16"></A><b>8.</b><i> And the foolish said to the wise. </i>This is a reproof of the late repentance of those who never think of what they are in want of, till <i>the door is shut </i>against every remedy. For those who do not make provision for a long period are charged 			 with folly, because they are careless, and flatter themselves amidst their poverty, and allow the season of mutual intercourse to pass in such a way as to despise the aids which were offered to them. As they do not, in proper time, bethink themselves about procuring oil, Christ, mocking the knowledge which they have acquired when it is too late, shows how their stupidity will be punished, when they shall see themselves to be empty and unprovided, while there is no remedy.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxii-p17"></A><a name="ii.xxii-p17.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxii-p18"></A><b>9.</b> <i>Lest there be not enough for you and us. </i>We know that the Lord distributes his gifts so variously to each, according to his measure, in order that they may give mutual aid to each other, and may employ for the general advantage what has been entrusted to each individual; and that in this way is preserved 			 the sacred connection which exists among the members of the Church. But Christ here points out the time when he shall summon all men to his tribunal, each carrying his bundle, that he may bring with him according as he has done in his body. That portion of grace received, which every man has laid up for himself, is, therefore, justly compared to a stock of provisions for a journey, which <i>would not be enough </i>for a greater number of persons.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxii-p19"></A><i>But rather go to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. </i>These words immediately follow, and are not intended as an admonition, but a reproof; and the meaning is: &#8220;There once was a time for <i>buying, </i>which you ought not to have neglected; for <i>oil </i>was at that time offered for sale, but the means of obtaining it are now withdrawn.&#8221; And yet it is foolish in the Papists to infer from this, that by our own virtues or industry we obtain the gift of perseverance. For the word <i>buy </i>does not at all imply that a price has been given; as appears clearly from the passage in Isaiah, 			 (55:1) where the Lord, while he invites us <i>to buy, </i>demands no price, but informs us, that he has <i>wine and milk in abundance, </i>to be gratuitously bestowed. There is no other way of obtaining it, therefore, but to receive by faith what is offered to us.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxii-p20"></A><a name="ii.xxii-p20.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxii-p21"></A><b>10.</b> <i>And the door was shut. </i>At length it follows that <i>the door </i>of the heavenly kingdom <i>will be shut </i>against all who have not 			 made provision, because they failed in the middle of the course. We must not enter here into minute inquiries, how it is that Christ says that <i>the foolish virgins </i>went to buy for it means nothing else than that all who shall not be ready at the very moment when they shall be called will be <i>shut out </i>from entering into heaven.</p>
