<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p4"></A><b>2</b> To Timothy, my beloved son,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">276</FONT></A>
 				 grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p6"></A><b>3</b> I give thanks to God, whom I worship from my ancestors, in a pure conscience, as I make continual mention of thee in my prayers night and day,</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p7"></A><b>4</b> Desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p8"></A><b>5</b> Calling to remembrance that unfeigned faith which is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that (it dwelleth) in thee also.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">277</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p10"></A><b>6</b> For which cause I advise thee to stir up the gift of God which is in thee, by the laying on of my hands;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p11"></A><b>7</b> For God hath not given to us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of soberness.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p12"></A><b>8</b> Be not ashamed, therefore, of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, who am his prisoner; but be thou a partaker of the afflictions of the gospel, according to the power of God;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p13"></A><b>9</b> Who hath saved us and hath called us with a holy calling; not according to our works, but according to his purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before eternal ages,</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p14"></A><b>10 </b>But hath now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who hath indeed destroyed death, and hath brought to light life and immortality by the gospel.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p15"></A><b>11 </b>To which I have been appointed a herald, and an apostle, and a teacher of the gentiles;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p16"></A><b>12 </b>For which cause also I suffer these things, but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep what I have intrusted to him till that day.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p17"></A><b>13 </b>Hold the form of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p18"></A><b>14 </b>Guard the excellent thing to thee by the Holy Spirit, who dwelleth in us.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p19"></A><b>15 </b>Thou knowest this, that all that are in Asia have forsaken me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p20"></A><b>16 </b>May the Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus; for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p21"></A><b>17 </b>But when he was in Rome, he sought me out diligently, and found me.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p22"></A><b>18 </b>May the Lord grant to him that he may find mercy with the Lord on that day; and how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus, thou knowest well.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_277"></A><A HREF="#fn_277"><FONT SIZE="1">278</FONT></A>

<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p3"></A><b>1</b> Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p4"></A><b>2</b> And what things thou hast heard from me by many witnesses, these commit thou to believing men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p5"></A><b>3</b> Do thou therefore endure afflictions, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p6"></A><b>4</b> No man who warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of life, that he may please his general.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p7"></A><b>5</b> And if any one also strive, he is not crowned, unless he strive lawfully.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p8"></A><b>6</b> The husbandman must labor before he receive the fruits.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p9"></A><b>7</b> Understand what I say; and may the Lord give thee understanding in all things!</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p10"></A><b>8</b> Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, hath been raised from the dead, according to my gospel;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p11"></A><b>9</b> In which I am a sufferer, as an evil &#8212; doer, even to bonds, but the word of God is not bound.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Wherefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>It is a faithful saying; for if we die with him, we shall also live with him;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>If we suffer, we shall also reign with him;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_278"></A><A HREF="#fn_278"><FONT SIZE="1">279</FONT></A>
 				 if we deny him,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_279"></A><A HREF="#fn_279"><FONT SIZE="1">280</FONT></A>
 				 he will also deny us;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p17"></A><b>13 </b>If we are unbelieving, he remaineth faithful; he cannot deny himself.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p18"></A><b>14 </b>Remind them of these things, solemnly charging them before the Lord not to dispute about words, for no use, (but) for the subversion of the hearers.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p19"></A><b>15 </b>Study to shew thyself to be approved by God, a workman that doth not blush, dividing aright the word of truth.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p20"></A><b>16 </b>But avoid profane and unmeaning noises; for they will grow to greater ungodliness.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p21"></A><b>17 </b>And their word will eat as a gangrene; of the number of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p22"></A><b>18 </b>Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is already past, and subvert the faith of some.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p23"></A><b>19 </b>Nevertheless, the foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal, The Lord knoweth who are his, and, Let every one that calleth on the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p24"></A><b>20 </b>Now, in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor and some to dishonor</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p25"></A><b>21 </b>If any one, therefore, shall cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel sanctified for honor, and useful for the Lord, being prepared for every good work.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p26"></A><b>22 </b>Flee youthful desires; but follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with all that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p27"></A><b>23 </b>But avoid foolish and uninstructive questions, knowing that they beget quarrels.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p28"></A><b>24 </b>But the servant of the Lord must not fight, but must be gentle towards all, qualified for teaching, patient to the bad,</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p29"></A><b>25 </b>Instructing <i>(or, chastising) </i>those who resist, if some time God give to them repentance for the acknowledgment of the truth,</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p30"></A><b>26 </b>And deliverance <i>(or, return to a sound mind) </i>from the snare of the devil, by whom they are held captive at his will.</p>  <a name="vii.ii.iii"></A>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p1"></A>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref13"><a name="vii.ii.iii-p2"></A>CHAPTER 3</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p3"></A><b>1</b> But know this, that in the last days there will arise dangerous <i>(or,</i> <i>troublesome</i>) times.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p4"></A><b>2</b> For men will be lovers of themselves, covetous, proud, slanderers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p5"></A><b>3</b> Without natural affection,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_280"></A><A HREF="#fn_280"><FONT SIZE="1">281</FONT></A>
 				 covenant breakers, false accusers, intemperate, fierce, despisers of those that are good;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p7"></A><b>4</b> Traitors, rash, haughty, lovers of pleasures rather than of God;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p8"></A><b>5</b> Having a form of godliness, while they deny the power of it.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p9"></A><b>6</b> Turn away from those persons; for of those are they who creep into families, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, who are led away by various sinful desires;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p10"></A><b>7</b> Always learning, while yet they never can come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p11"></A><b>8</b> And as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth, men corrupted in understanding, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p12"></A><b>9</b> But they shall not proceed further; for the madness of the latter shall be manifest to all, as was also that of time former.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p13"></A><b>10 </b>But thou hast closely followed my doctrine, instruction,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_281"></A><A HREF="#fn_281"><FONT SIZE="1">282</FONT></A>
 				 purpose, faith, meekness, love, patience;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p15"></A><b>11 </b>Persecutions, afflictions, which befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured; but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p16"></A><b>12 </b>And all who wish to live a godly life in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p17"></A><b>13 </b>But wicked men and impostors will grow worse and worse, going astray, and leading others astray.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p18"></A><b>14 </b>But as for thee, continue in those things which thou hast learned, and which have been intrusted to thee, knowing from whom thou hast learned them;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p19"></A><b>15 </b>And that from (thy) childhood thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise to salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p20"></A><b>16 </b>All scripture (<i>or, the whole of scripture</i>) is divinely inspired, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p21"></A><b>17 </b>That the man of God may be perfect, being made ready for every good work.</p>  <a name="vii.ii.iv"></A>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p1"></A>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref13"><a name="vii.ii.iv-p2"></A>CHAPTER 4</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p3"></A><b>1</b> I adjure thee, therefore, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead, at his appearing and his kingdom.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p4"></A><b>2</b> Preach the word; apply thyself in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all gentleness and doctrine.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p5"></A><b>3</b> For there will be a time, when they will not endure sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, shall heap up to themselves according to their sinful desires;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p6"></A><b>4</b> And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned to fables.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p7"></A><b>5</b> But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, render thy ministry approved.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p8"></A><b>6</b> For I am now offered as a sacrifice, and the time of my dissolution is at hand.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p9"></A><b>7</b> I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p10"></A><b>8</b> Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will render to me on that day, and not to me only, but likewise to all who love his coming.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p11"></A><b>9</b> Make haste to come to me quickly.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p12"></A><b>10 </b>For Demas hath forsaken me, having embraced this world, and is gone away to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p13"></A><b>11 </b>Luke alone is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee, for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p14"></A><b>12 </b>And I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p15"></A><b>13 </b>When thou shalt come, bring the cloak which I left at Carpus, and the books, and the parchments.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p16"></A><b>14 </b>Alexander the coppersmith hath done me many evil things; may the Lord reward him according to his works!</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p17"></A><b>15 </b>Of whom beware thou also; for he vehemently opposed our discourses.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p18"></A><b>16 </b>At my first defense no man assisted me, but all forsook me; may it not be laid to their charge!</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p19"></A><b>17 </b>But the Lord assisted and strengthened me, that through me the proclamation might be confirmed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p20"></A><b>18 </b>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory for ever and ever! Amen.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p21"></A><b>19 </b>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the family of Onesiphorus.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p22"></A><b>20 </b>Erastus remained at Corinth; but I left Trophimus at Miletum sick.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p23"></A><b>21 </b>Make haste to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p24"></A><b>22 </b>The Lord Jesus Christ (be) with thy spirit. Grace be with thee. Amen</p>  			 
<p class="Italic"><a name="vii.ii.iv-p25"></A>This Second (Epistle) was written from Rome to Timothy, who was the first bishop ordained at Ephesus, when Paul was brought the second time before Caesar Nero.</p>
