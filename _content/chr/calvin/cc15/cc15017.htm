<p><a name="xviii.ii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>The sword of Jehovah hath been filled with blood; It hath been made fat with fatness; Even with the blood of lambs And of goats, With the fat of the kidneys of rams; For the sacrifice of Jehovah is on Bozrah, And a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.ii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>And the unicorns shall come down with them, And the bullocks with the bulls; And their land shall be made drunken with blood, And their dust shall be made fat with fatness.</p>

<p><a name="xviii.iv-p3"></A><b>1 </b>It came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came up against all the defended cities of Judah, And took them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Then the king of Assyria sent Rabshakch from Lachish, with a powerful army, to Jerusalem, to king Hezekiah, who stood at the conduit of the upper pool in the way of the fullers field.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And there came out to him Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, And Shebna the chancellor, And Joab, the son of Asaph, the secretary.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p6"></A><b>4 </b>And Rabshakeh said to them: Say now to Hezekiah? Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this in which thou trustest? I have said, (only a word of the lips.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Counsel And strength for war. Now in whom hast thou trusted, that thou hast rebelled against me?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Behold, thou hast rusted in that broken staff of reed, on Egypt, on which if one lean, it will go into his hand And pierce it. Such is Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to all who have confidence in him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p9"></A><b>7 </b>And if thou shalt say to me, We trust in Jehovah our God; is it not, he whose high places And altars Hezekiah hath taken away, And hath said to Judah And Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p10"></A><b>8 </b>Now, come, give a hostage to my master, the king of Assyria. I will give thee two thousand horses; wilt thou have horsemen to set upon them?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p11"></A><b>9 </b>And how dost thou despise the face of one captain of the least of my masters servants, And place thy confidence in Egypt for chariots And horsemen?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p12"></A><b>10 </b>And have I now come up without Jehovah to this land, to destroy it? Jehovah said to me: Go up against this land, to destroy it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p13"></A><b>11 </b>Then said Eliakim, And Shebna, And Joah, to Rabshakeh: Speak, I pray, to thy servants, in the Syrian language, (for we understand it,) And speak not to us in the Jewish language, in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p14"></A><b>12 </b>And Rabshakeh said: Hath my master sent me to thy master And to thee to speak those words? Is it not to the men who sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, And drink their own urine with you?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Therefore Rabshakeh stood, And cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language, And said: Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p16"></A><b>14 </b>Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah impose upon you, for he will not be able to deliver you.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p17"></A><b>15 </b>And let not Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, By delivering will Jehovah deliver us; this city shall not be given up into the hand of the king of Assyria.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p18"></A><b>16 </b>Listen not to Hezekiah; for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make with me a blessing, And come out; And let every one eat of his own vine, And let every one eat of his own fig-tree, And let every one drink the waters of his own well.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p19"></A><b>17 </b>Till I come And take you into a land like your own land, a land of corn And wine, a land of bread And vineyards.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p20"></A><b>18 </b>Lest perhaps Hezekiah deceive you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p21"></A><b>19 </b>Where is the god of Hamath And Arpad? Where is the god of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p22"></A><b>20 </b>Who is there among all the gods of those lands that hath delivered his land out of my hand; that Jehovah should rescue Jerusalem out of my hand?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p23"></A><b>21 </b>They were silent, And did not answer him a word; for this was the commandment of the king, Do not answer him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.iv-p24"></A><b>22 </b>Then came Eliakim, who was over the house And Shebna the chancellor, And Joab, the son of Asaph, the secretary, to Hezekiah, with rent garments, And told him the words of Rabshakeh.</p>  <a name="xviii.v"></A>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xviii.v-p1"></A>  		  
<p class="BOOK-CHAP-GR-16-CEN25"><a name="xviii.v-p2"></A>CHAPTER 37</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p3"></A><b>1 </b>Now, it came to pass, that Hezekiah, when he heard this rent his clothes, And covered himself with sackcloth, And went into the house of Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p4"></A><b>2 </b>At the same time he sent Eliakim, who was over the palace, And Shebna the chancellor, and the eldest of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Who said to him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, And of blasphemy; for the children have come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p6"></A><b>4 </b>If, perhaps, Jehovah thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom his master, the king of Assyria, hath sent to curse the living God, And to rebuke with words which Jehovah thy God hath heard. Thou shalt therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that is still left.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p7"></A><b>5 </b>The servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p8"></A><b>6 </b>And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master: Thus saith Jehovah, Fear not the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have reproached me.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Behold, I will bring a wind upon him; for he shall hear a report, And shall return to his own land; And I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p10"></A><b>8 </b>And Rabshakeh, having returned, found the king of Assyria besieging Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p11"></A><b>9 </b>And hearing concerning Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, He hath gone out to fight against thee; after having heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Thus shall ye say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given up into the hand of the king of Assyria.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p13"></A><b>11 </b>Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to at hands, how they have destroyed them; And shalt thou be delivered?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers destroyed, Gozan, And Itaran, And Rezeph, And the children of Edom, who were in Telassar?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arphad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena And Iva?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p16"></A><b>14 </b>Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, And read it, And went up to the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p17"></A><b>15 </b>Then Hezekiah prayed to God, saying:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p18"></A><b>16 </b>O Jehovah of hosts, God of Israel, who dwellest between the cherubim, thou alone art God over all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven And earth.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p19"></A><b>17 </b>Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, And hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, And see; And hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to reproach the living God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p20"></A><b>18 </b>Truly, O Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the nations, And their land,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p21"></A><b>19 </b>And have cast their gods into the fire; for they were not gods, but the work of men&#8217;s hands, wood, And stone; therefore they have destroyed them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p22"></A><b>20 </b>And now, O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand; that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou alone art Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p23"></A><b>21 </b>Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent to Hezekiah, saying: Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Since thou hast prayed to me concerning Sennacherib, king of Assyria;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.v-p24"></A><b>22 </b>This is the word which Jehovah hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee, hath laughed at thee; The daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. Whom hast thou reproached?</p>

<p><a name="xviii.v-p26"></A><b>24 </b>By the hand of thy servants thou hast reproached the Lord, And hast said, By the multitude of my chariots I will go up, To the heights of the mountains, To the sides of Lebanon; I will cut down the tallest of her cedars, Her choice firs; Then will I come to the height of his border, And even to his level forest.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_249"></A><A HREF="#fn_249"><FONT SIZE="1">250</FONT></A>
