<span id="v.xxi-p1"></span>DEUTERONOMY 10

<span id="v.xxi-p2"></span><span id="v.xxi-p2.1"></span>[Deut.
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#021),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#022)<span id="v.xxi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="v.xxi-p3"></span>**21.** He *is* thy praise, and he *is* thy
God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things which thine
eyes have seen.

<span id="v.xxi-p4"></span>**21.** Jehova est laus tua, et ipse est Dens
qui fecit tecum magna et terribilia ista quae viderunt oculi tui.

<span id="v.xxi-p5"></span>**22.** Thy fathers went down into Egypt with
threescore and ten persons; and now the Lord thy God hath made thee as
the stars of heaven for multitude.

<span id="v.xxi-p6"></span>**22.** Cum septuaginta animabus descenderunt
patres tui in Aegyptum: nunc autem posuit to Jehova Deus tuus sicut
stellas coeli in multitudinem.

<span id="v.xxi-p7"></span><span id="v.xxi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="v.xxi-p8"></span>**21.** *He is thy praise.* That he may the
more easily persuade his countrymen that nothing is better, or more
desirable for them than to devote themselves to God’s service, Moses
reminds them that they have nothing to boast of out of Him; as if he had
said, that they were happy in this one respect, that God had taken them
under His charge; but that if this glory were to be taken away, they
would be miserable and ruined. For God is called “the praise” of His
people, as being their honor and their ornament. Consequently, if they
desire to enjoy true and solid blessedness, they must take care to keep
themselves under His guardianship; for, if they should be deprived of
this, nothing would remain to them but ignominy and shame. To the same
effect, he adds, that He is their God; because nothing can be more
perverse and absurd than not to receive the Creator of the world
Himself, when He freely offers Himself as our God. In proof of this, he
subjoins, that He has exerted His power in many miracles for His
people’s safety; and, in order that they might be rendered the more
inexcusable, he cites their own eyes as witnesses of so many mighty acts
which had been wrought in their favor. Thence he goes a step higher,
(reminding them,  <span id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251) ) that their
race had been wondrously increased in a short time; whence it was plain,
that they had been thus incredibly multiplied by preternatural and
divine influence. For assuredly the signal blessing of God was clearly
manifested, in the procreation of seven hundred thousand men in less
than two hundred and fifty years.  <span
id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252) Those who then lived had not seen them
with their own eyes; but Moses retraces God’s grace to the fountainhead,
that they may more fully acknowledge, that whatever good they had
experienced depended on that adoption, which had made them God’s people.
