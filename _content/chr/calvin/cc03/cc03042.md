<span id="v.xvii-p1"></span>DEUTERONOMY 27

<span id="v.xvii-p2"></span>deuteronomy 27:1-4, 8

<span id="v.xvii-p3"></span>**1.** And Moses, with the elders of Israel,
commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command
you this day.

<span id="v.xvii-p4"></span>**1.** Et praecepit Moses et seniores
Israelis populo, dicendo, Custodi omnia praecepta quae ego praecipio
vobis hodie.

<span id="v.xvii-p5"></span>**2.** And it shall be, on the day when ye
shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee,
that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaster them with plaster.

<span id="v.xvii-p6"></span>**2.** Erit, quo die transieritis Jordanem
ad terram quam Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi, statues tibi lapides magnos,
et lines calce.

<span id="v.xvii-p7"></span>**3.** And thou shalt write upon them all
the words of this law, when thou art passed over; that thou mayest go in
unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth
with milk and honey; as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee.

<span id="v.xvii-p8"></span>**3.** Et scribes in illis omnia verba Legis
hujus, quum transieris ut venias in terram quam Jehova Deus tuus dat
tibi, terram fluentem lacte et melle: sicut loquutus est Jehova Deus
patrum tuorum tibi.

<span id="v.xvii-p9"></span>**4.** Therefore it shall be, when ye be
gone over Jordan, *that* ye shall set up these stones, which I command
you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster.

<span id="v.xvii-p10"></span>**4.** Erit ergo quum transieritis
Jordanem, statuetis lapides istos de quibus ego praecipio vobis hodie,
et lines eos calce.

<span id="v.xvii-p11"></span>**8.** And thou shalt write upon the stones
all the words of this law very plainly.

<span id="v.xvii-p12"></span>**8.** Et scribes in lapidibus omnia verba
Legis hujus *(ad verbum,* bene) distincte explicando.

<span id="v.xvii-p13"></span><span id="v.xvii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="v.xvii-p14"></span>**1.** *And Moses, with the elders.* This
precept is of the same character as those that have preceded it; for, as
God would have His precepts written on the door-posts, and on the
borders of their garments, so that they might constantly meet their
eyes, so also would He have a monument existing at the very entrance of
their land, from which the people might learn that they dwelt in it, in
order that they might worship God purely. Wherefore, lest by the
people’s carelessness the knowledge of the Law should be obscured, or in
any way obliterated, God would have its sum inscribed in a conspicuous
place. Hence may be gathered the similarity I have adverted to between
the private houses of individuals and the whole land. When the precepts
were written on the doors, every one was admonished that his house was
sacred to God, and the same was the case with the whole land, so that
whosoever entered it might know that it was, as it were, the sanctuary
of heavenly doctrine, and thus their zeal might be stirred up to the
pure worship of God. The object of the plain and distinct writing of the
Scripture, referred to in verse 8, was to take away (the excuse of
 <span id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236) ) ignorance.
