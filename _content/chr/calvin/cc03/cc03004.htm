<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.i.i-p17"></A><b>1.</b> <i>These are the names</i>  It is the intention of Moses to describe the miraculous deliverance of the people, (from whence the Greeks gave the name to the book;) but, before he comes to that, he briefly reminds us that the promise given to Abraham was not 				ineffectual, that his seed should be multiplied</p>  			 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.i.i-p18"></A>&#8220;as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea-shore.&#8221; (<a name="iv.i.i-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017">Ge 22:17</a><a name="iv.i.i-p18.1"></A>.)</p>  			 
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text10"><a name="iv.i.i-p19"></A>This, then, is the commencement of the book, &#8212; that although their going down from the land of Canaan into Egypt might have seemed at the time as it were the end and abolition of God&#8217;s covenant, yet in his own time he abundantly accomplished what he had promised to his servant as to the increase of his descendants. However, he only mentions by name the twelve patriarchs who went down with their father Jacob, and then sums up the whole 				number of persons, as in two other passages. (<a name="iv.i.i-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#027">Ge 46:27</a><a name="iv.i.i-p19.1"></A>, and <a name="iv.i.i-p19.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#022">De 10:22</a><a name="iv.i.i-p19.2"></A>.) The calculation is perfectly accurate, if Jacob is counted among the thirty and six souls in the first catalogue. For it is a far-fetched addition of the Rabbins  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>
 				to count in Jochebed the mother of Moses, to complete the number; and it is not probable that a woman, who was afterwards born in Egypt, should be reckoned among the men whom Jacob brought with him. If any object that the seventy are said to have &#8220;come out of the loins of Jacob,&#8221; the discrepancy is easily explained by the common scriptural use of the figure <i>synecdoche</i>  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>
 				That he from whom the others sprung is not excluded, we gather from the words of Moses, (<a name="iv.i.i-p21.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#022">De 10:22</a><a name="iv.i.i-p21.1"></A>,)</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.i.i-p23"></A>But there is no reason to add five more, as we read in the address of Stephen recorded by Luke, (<a name="iv.i.i-p23.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#014">Ac 7:14</a><a name="iv.i.i-p23.1"></A>;) for we cannot be surprised that in this mode of expressing numbers this error should have occurred by the introduction of a single letter. Should any objector make this an handle for controversy, we should remember that the Spirit, by the mouth of Paul, 				does not warn us without purpose</p>  			 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.i.i-p24"></A>&#8220;not to give heed to genealogies.&#8221; (<a name="iv.i.i-p24.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004">1Ti 1:4</a><a name="iv.i.i-p24.1"></A>.)</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.i.i-p26"></A><b>6.</b><i> And Joseph died.</i> The Rabbins ignorantly conclude from this expression that Joseph died first of his brethren, whereas it is evident that the others were passed over, and his name was expressly mentioned to do him honor, as being the only one then in authority. How long they survived their father, Moses 				does not say, but only marks the beginning of the change, &#8212; as much as to say, the Israelites were humanely treated for a considerable space of time; so that the condition of those who went down with Jacob was tolerable, since, free from all injustice and tyranny, they tranquilly enjoyed the hospitality accorded to them. At the same time, he gives us to understand that, when all that generation was gone, the desire and the memory of the land of Canaan, which they had never seen, might have died 				out of the minds of their descendants, if they had not been forcibly aroused to seek after it. And unquestionably, since that people were forgetful and careless of meditating on God&#8217;s mercies, God could not have better provided for their salvation than by allowing them to be cruelly tried and afflicted; otherwise, as though their origin had been in Egypt, they might have preferred to have remained for ever in their nest, and by that indifference the hope of the promised heritage would have been 				effaced from their hearts.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.i.i-p27"></A><a name="iv.i.i-p27.1"></A></p>  			 
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.i.i-p28"></A><b>7.</b> <i>And the children of Israel were fruitful.</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>
 				 To what an extent they increased Moses relates in the 12th chapter, viz., to the number of 600,000, besides women and children; which was certainly an incredible increase for so short a time. For, though 430 years be counted from the date of the covenant with Abraham to the departure of the people, it is clear that half of them had elapsed before Jacob went down into Egypt; so that the 				Israelites sojourned in that land only 200 years, or little more &#8212; say ten years more. How then could it come to pass that in so short a time a single family could have grown into so many myriads? It would have been an immense and extraordinary increase if 10,000 had sprung from every tribe; but this more than quadruples that number. Wherefore certain sceptics, perceiving that the relation of Moses surpasses the ordinary ratio of human propagation, and estimating the power of God by their own 				sense and experience, altogether refuse to credit it. For such is the perverseness of men, that they always seek for opportunities of despising or disallowing the works of God; such, too, is their audacity and insolence that they shamelessly apply all the acuteness they possess to detract from his glory. If their reason assures them that what is related as a miracle is possible, they attribute it to natural causes, &#8212; so is God robbed and defrauded of the praise his power deserves; if it is 				incomprehensible to them, they reject it as a prodigy.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>
 				 But if they cannot bring themselves to acknowledge the interference of God except in matters by the magnitude of which they are struck with astonishment, why do they not persuade themselves of the truth of whatever common sense repudiates? They ask how this can be, as if it were reasonable that the hand of God should be so restrained as to be unable to do anything which exceeds the bounds of human comprehension. 				Whereas, because we are naturally so slow to profit by his ordinary operations, it is rather necessary that we should be awakened into admiration by extraordinary dealings.</p>  			 
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="iv.i.i-p31"></A><a name="iv.i.i-p31.1"></A>Let us conclude, then, that since Moses does not here speak of the natural course of human procreation, but celebrates a miracle unheard of before, by which God ratified the truth of his promise, we should judge of it perversely, and maliciously, if we measure it by our own feeble reason, instead of meditating with reverence <a name="iv.i.i-p31.2"></A>upon what far transcends all our senses. Let us 				rather remember how God reproves his unbelieving people by the Prophet Isaiah. (<a name="iv.i.i-p31.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001">Isa 51:1</a><a name="iv.i.i-p31.3"></A><a name="iv.i.i-p31.4"></A>) For, in order to prove that it would not be difficult for Him, in spite of the small number to which the Israelites were reduced, to produce a great multitude, He bids them look into &#8220;the <a name="iv.i.i-p31.5"></A>hole of the pit from whence they were digged,&#8221; viz., to 				Abraham, and Sarah that bare them, whom he multiplied though alone, and childless. Certain Rabbins, after their custom, imagine that four infants were produced at a birth; for as often as they meet with any point which perplexes them, they gratuitously invent whatever suits them, and then obtrude their imaginations as indubitable facts; and proceed foolishly, and unseasonably, to discuss that this is physically probable. There are Christians, too, who, with little consideration, have imitated 				them here, contending that what Moses describes is in accordance with experience, because the fecundity of certain nations has been almost as great. We indeed sometimes see confirmed by remarkable examples what the Psalmist says, (<a name="iv.i.i-p31.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#036">Ps 107:36</a><a name="iv.i.i-p31.6"></A><a name="iv.i.i-p31.7"></A>,) that God &#8220;maketh <a name="iv.i.i-p31.8"></A>the hungry to dwell&#8221; in the wilderness, &#8220;that they may prepare a city for 				habitation, and sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase; and he blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;&#8221; as also, that &#8220;He turneth a fruitful land into barrenness,&#8221; and strips it of inhabitants; but the design of Moses is to shew, that there never was any fecundity, which was not inferior to the increase of the people of Israel. Hence his comparison between the seventy souls, and the multitude which proceeded from them, that this special blessing 				of God might be distinguished from ordinary cases; hence too the accumulated expressions, which undoubtedly are meant for amplification, that &#8220;they <a name="iv.i.i-p31.9"></A>were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.&#8221; For the repetition of the adverb, <i>Meod</i><a name="iv.i.i-p31.10"></A>,<i> Meod</i><a name="iv.i.i-p31.11"></A>,<i> 				</i><a name="iv.i.i-p31.12"></A>marks an unusual abundance, Nor do I reject the conjecture of some, that in the word <a name="iv.i.i-p31.13"></A>&#1513;&#1512;&#1507;<a name="iv.i.i-p31.14"></A>, <i>sharatz</i><a name="iv.i.i-p31.15"></A>, <a name="iv.i.i-p31.16"></A>there is a metaphor taken from fishes, but I know not whether it is very sound, since the word is used generally for any multiplication.</p>  <a name="iv.i.ii"></A>

<p class="TableText17"><a name="iv.i.ii-p2"></A><b>8.</b> Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.i.ii-p13"></A><b>8.</b> <i>Now there arose a new king.</i> When more than one hundred years had been happily passed in freedom and repose, the condition of the elect people began to be changed. Moses relates that the commencement of their troubles proceeded from jealousy, and from the groundless fear of the 				Egyptians, because they conceived that danger might arise from this strange nation, unless they hastened to oppress it. But before he comes to this, he premises that the remembrance of the benefits received from Joseph had departed, because it might have in some measure mitigated their cruelty, had it still been unimpaired. It is probable that this oblivion of the gratitude due to him arose from the moderation of Joseph; for if he had demanded great privileges for his people, and immunity from 				tributes and burdens, the remembrances of the saving of the country by an Israelite would have been famous for many ages; but it appears that he was content with the kind hospitality afforded them, that his brethren might dwell comfortably, and without molestation in the land of Goshen, because he wished them to be sojourners there until the time of deliverance arrived. And in this way he best provided for their safety, lest being thus ensnared, they might have fallen into the nets of 				destruction. But in proportion as the moderation of the holy man exposed them not to jealousy and complaint, so was the ingratitude of the Egyptians less excusable in forgetting, after little more than a single century, that remarkable benefit, which should have been everywhere preserved in their public monuments, lest the name of Joseph should ever perish. Their unkindness, then, was intolerable, in refusing that his kindred and descendants should sojourn with them, since they ought to have 				ascribed the safety of themselves and their country, after God, to him, or rather under the hand and with the blessing of God. But this disease has always been flagrant in the world; and certainly it is good for us that evil should ever be our reward from men for our kindnesses, that we may learn in the performance of our duty to look to God alone, since otherwise we are unduly addicted to conciliate favor and applause for ourselves, or to seek 				after more earthly advantages. Still it was no common return which the Israelites had liberally received during more than 100 years for Joseph&#8217;s sake, that they lived comfortably in a proud, avaricious, and cruel nation. Nevertheless, whatever happens, although we are not only defrauded of all recompense, but even although many of whom we have deserved well conspire for our destruction, let us never regret having done rightly; and, in the meantime, let us learn that nothing is more effective to 				restrain the desire of doing wrong, than those ties of mutual connection, by which God has bound us together.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A>
 				 But, although the favor conferred by Joseph had been forgotten by all, the shame and sin of ingratitude cleaves especially to the king; in whom it was more than base to forget by whose industry and care he received so rich a yearly revenue. For the holy Patriarch, by buying up the land, had obtained a fifth part of the produce as a yearly tribute for the king. But so are tyrants accustomed to engulf whatever is paid them, without considering by what right it is 				acquired.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.i.ii-p15"></A><a name="iv.i.ii-p15.1"></A></p>  			 
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="iv.i.ii-p16"></A><b>9.</b> <i>And he said unto his people.</i> <a name="iv.i.ii-p16.1"></A>That is to say, in a public assembly, such as kings are wont to hold for consultation on public affairs. As if Moses had said that this point was proposed by the king for deliberation by his estates; viz., that because it was to be apprehended that 				the Israelites, trusting in their multitude and strength, might rise in rebellion, or might take advantage of any public disturbance to shake off the yoke and to leave Egypt, they should be anticipated, and afflicted with heavy burdens, to prevent their making any such attempt. This Pharaoh calls   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A>
 				<a name="iv.i.ii-p17.8"></A> &#8220;dealing <a name="iv.i.ii-p17.9"></A>wisely with them;&#8221; for though the word <a name="iv.i.ii-p17.10"></A>&#1495;&#1499;&#1501;<a name="iv.i.ii-p17.11"></A>, <i>chakam</i><a name="iv.i.ii-p17.12"></A>, <a name="iv.i.ii-p17.13"></A>is often taken, in a bad sense, to mean &#8220;to <a name="iv.i.ii-p17.14"></A>overreach with cunning,&#8221; still in this case he 				concealed under an honest pretext the injury which he proposed to do them, alleging that prudent advice should be taken lest the Egyptians might suffer great loss through their carelessness and delay. This was common with heathen nations, to profess in their counsels, that what was right should be preferred to what was profitable; but, when it comes to the point, covetousness generally so blinds everybody, that they lose their respect for what is right, and are hurried away headlong to their 				own advantage. They make out too that what is advantageous is necessary; and so persuade themselves that whatever they are compelled to do is right. For that specious yet fallacious pretext readily occurs, and easily deceives, that, when any danger is apprehended, it ought to be met. By the tragic poets, indeed, that detestable sentiment, <i>occupandum esse scelus</i><a name="iv.i.ii-p17.15"></A>, <a name="iv.i.ii-p17.16"></A>&#8220;that<i> 				</i><a name="iv.i.ii-p17.17"></A>we should be beforehand in crime,&#8221; is attributed to wicked and desperate characters; because our nature convinces us that it is unjust and absurd; and yet is it commonly considered the best mode of precaution, so that only those are accounted provident who consult for their own security by injuring others, if occasion requires it. From this source almost all wars proceed; because, whilst every prince fears his neighbor, this fear so fills him with apprehension, that he 				does not hesitate to cover the earth with human blood. Hence, too, amongst private individuals, arises the license for deceit, murder, rapine, and lying, because they think that injuries would be repelled too late, unless they respectively anticipated them. But this is a wicked kind of cunning, (however it may be varnished over with the specious name of foresight,) unjustly to molest others for our own security. I fear this or that person, because he both has the means of injuring me, and I am 				uncertain of his disposition towards me; therefore, in order that I may be safe from harm, I will endeavor by every possible means to oppress him. In this way the most contemptible, and imbecile, if he be inclined to mischief, will be armed for our hurt, and so we shall stand in doubt of the greater part of mankind. If thus every one should indulge his own distrust, while each will be devising to do some injury to his possible enemies, there will be no end to iniquities. Wherefore we must 				oppose the providence of God to these immoderate cares and anxieties which withdraw us from the course of justice. Reposing on this, no fear of danger will ever impel us to unjust deeds or crooked counsels. In the words of Pharaoh, all is otherwise; for, having given warning that the Israelites might, if they would, be injurious, he advises that their strength should in some way or other be broken. For, when we have once determined to provide for our own advantage, or quiet, or safety, we ask 				not the question whether we are doing right or wrong.</p>  			 
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.i.ii-p18"></A><i>Behold, the people.</i> It not unfrequently happens that the minds of the wicked are aroused to jealousy by the mercies of God, acting like fans to light up their wrath. Nevertheless, the very least proof of his favor ought not on that account to be less agreeable to us, because it is made an occasion to the wicked of dealing more 				cruelly with us. In fact, God thus attempers his bounty towards us, lest we should be too much taken up with earthly prosperity. Thus the blessing on which all his happiness depended banished Jacob from the home of his father, and from his promised inheritance; but yet he assuaged his grief with this single consolation, that he knew God to be reconciled to him. So also his posterity, the more they experienced of God&#8217;s goodness towards them, the more they were exposed to the enmity of the 				Egyptians. But Pharaoh, to render them hated, or suspected, refers to their power, and accuses them of disaffection, whereof they had given no token. Yet he does not accuse them of rebellion, as if they would take armed possession of the kingdom, but that they would depart elsewhere; whence we may conjecture, that they made no secret of the hope which God had given them of their return. But this seemed a plausible excuse enough, that it was anything but just for those, who had of their own 				accord sought the protection of the king, to be freely sent away; and thus   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A>

The exaction, then, by which Pharaoh broke faith with them, was in itself unjust; but the crime to which he proceeded was still greater, because he did not simply seek for pecuniary advantage, but desired to afflict the wretched people by the 				heaviness of their burdens.

Thus was that 				wicked and deceitful design frustrated, which the Egyptians had set on foot for destroying the Church.

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.i.iv-p19"></A><b>15.</b><i> And the king of Egypt spake.</i> The tyrant now descends from the open violence and cruelty which had availed nothing, to secret plots and deceit. He desires the infants to be killed at their birth; and commands the midwives to be the instruments of this dreadful barbarity. We read of no such detestable 				example of inhumanity since the world began. I admit it has occasionally happened, that, upon the capture of a city, the conquerors have not spared even children and infants; that is to say, either in the heat of battle, or because the defense had been too obstinate, and they had lost many of their men, whose death they would avenge. It has happened, too, that an uncle, or brother, or guardian, has been impelled by the ambition of reigning to put children to death. It has happened, again, that 				in the detestation of a tyrant, and to destroy the very memory of his family, his whole offspring has been slain; and some have proceeded to such cruelty against their enemies, as to tear the little ones from their mothers&#8217; breasts. But never did any enemy, however implacable, ever so vent his wrath against a whole nation, as to command all its male offspring to be destroyed in the midst of peace. This was a trial, such as to inflict a heavy blow on men of the utmost firmness, much more to 				bring low a fainting people, already weary of their lives. For, at first sight, each would think it more advantageous and desirable for them to sink down into an humbler state, than that the wrath of their enemies should be thus provoked against them by the blessings of God. And it is probable, such was the prostration of their minds, that they were not only sorely smitten, but almost stupified. For nothing else remained, but that the men should die without hope of offspring, and that the name 				and race of Abraham should soon be cut off, and thus all God&#8217;s promises would come to nought. In these days, in which we have to bear similar insults, and are urged to despair, as if the Church would soon be utterly destroyed, let us learn to hold up this example like a strong shield: seeing that it is no new case, if immediate destruction seem to await us, until the divine aid appears suddenly and unexpectedly in our extremity. Josephus falsely conjectures that the midwives were Egyptian 				women, sent out as spies; whereas Moses expressly says, that they had been the assistants and attendants of the Hebrew women in their travail; and this erroneous idea is plainly refuted by the whole context, in which it especially appears that they were restrained by the fear of God from yielding to the sinful desire of the tyrant. Hence it follows, that they were previously possessed with some religious feeling. But another question arises, why two midwives only are mentioned by name, when it 				is probable that, in so great a population, there were many? Two replies may be given; either that the tyrant addressed himself to these two, who might spread the fear of his power amongst the others; or, that, desiring to proceed with secret malice, he made a trial of the firmness of these two, and if he had obtained their acquiescence, he hoped to have easily succeeded with the others; for shame forbade him from issuing an open and general 				command.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.i.iv-p21"></A><b>17.</b> <i>But the midwives feared God.</i> Moses does not mean that they were then first affected with the fear of God; but he assigns this reason why they did not obey his unjust command, viz., because reverence towards God had greater influence with them. And certainly, as all our 				affections are best directed by this rein, so also it is the surest shield for resisting all temptations, and a firm support to uphold our minds from wavering in seasons of danger. Now, they not only dreaded this crime as being cruel and inhuman; but because purer religion and piety flourished in their hearts; for they knew that the seed of Abraham was chosen of God, and had themselves experienced that it was blessed; and hence it was natural to feel, that it would be an act of very gross 				impiety to extinguish in it the grace of God. We must also observe the <i>antithesis </i>between the fear of God and the dread of punishment, which might have deterred them from doing right. Although tyrants do not easily allow their commands to be despised, and death was before their eyes, they still keep their hands pure from evil. Thus, sustained and supported by reverential fear of God, they boldly despised the command and the threatenings of 				Pharaoh. Wherefore those, whom the fear of men withdraws from the right course, betray by their cowardice an inexcusable contempt of God, in preferring the favor of men to his solemn commands. But this doctrine extends still more widely; for many would be   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A>
 				 more than preposterously wise, whilst, under pretext of due submission, they obey the wicked will of kings in opposition to justice and right, being in some cases the ministers of avarice and rapacity, in others of cruelty; yea, to gratify the transitory kings of earth, they take no account of God; and thus, which is worst of all, they designedly oppose pure religion with fire and sword. It only makes their effrontery more detestable, that 				whilst they knowingly and willingly crucify Christ in his members, they plead the frivolous excuse, that they obey their princes according to the word of God; as if he, in ordaining princes, had resigned his rights to them; and as if every earthly power, which exalts itself against heaven, ought not rather most justly to be made to give way. But since they only seek to escape the reprobation of men for their criminal obedience, let them not be argued with by long discussions, but rather 				referred to the judgment of women; for the example of these midwives is abundantly sufficient for their condemnation; especially when the Holy Spirit himself commends them, as not having obeyed the king, because they feared God.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.i.iv-p24"></A><b>18.</b> <i>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives.</i> He was not reduced to a more moderate course by equity or mercy; but because he dared not openly expose to slaughter the wretched and harmless infants at their birth, lest such atrocity should arouse the wrath of the Israelites to 				vengeance, He therefore secretly sends for the midwives, and inquires why they have not executed his murderous command? I doubt not, however, that he was restrained rather by the fear of rebellion than by shame.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A>
 				 In the answer of the midwives two vices are to be observed, since they neither confessed their piety with proper ingenuity, and what is worse, escaped by falsehood. For the fabulous story which the Rabbins invent to cover their fault, must be rejected, viz., that they did not come in time to the Hebrew women, because they had warned them of the wicked design of the king; and so it came to pass that they were not present when they were delivered. What can be more 				tame than this invention, when Moses shews in his narrative that they were guilty of falsehood? Some assert that this kind of lie,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A>
 				 which they call &#8220;the lie officious, or serviceable,&#8221; is not reprehensible; because they think that there is no fault where no deceit for the purpose of injury is used.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A>
 				 But I hold, that whatever is opposed to the nature of God is sinful; and on this ground all dissimulation, whether in word or deed, is condemned, as I shall more largely discuss in explaining the law, if God grants me time to do so. Wherefore both points must be admitted, that the two women lied, and, since lying is displeasing to God, that they sinned. For, as in estimating the conduct of saints we should be just and humane interpreters; so also superstitious 				zeal must be avoided in covering their faults, since this would often infringe on the direct authority of Scripture. And, indeed, whensoever the faithful fall into sin, they desire not to be lifted out of it by false defences, for their justification consists in a simple and free demand of pardon for their sin. Nor is there any contradiction to this in the fact, that they are twice praised for their fear of God, and that God is said to have rewarded them; because in his paternal indulgence of 				his children he still values their good works, as if they were pure, notwithstanding they may be defiled by some mixture of impurity. In fact, there is no action so perfect as to be absolutely free from stain; though it may appear more evidently in some than in others. Rachel was influenced by faith, to transfer the right of primogeniture to her son Jacob; a desire, undoubtedly, pious in itself, and a design worthy of praise, anxiously to strive for the fulfillment of the divine promise; but 				yet we cannot praise the cunning and deceit, by which the whole action would have been vitiated, had not the gratuitous mercy of God interposed. Scripture is full of such instances, which shew that the most excellent actions are sometimes stained with partial sin. But we need not wonder that God in his mercy should pardon such defects, which would otherwise defile almost every virtuous deed; and should honor with reward those works which are unworthy of praise, or even favor. Thus, though these 				women were too pusillanimous and timid in their answers, yet because they had acted in reality with heartiness and courage, God endured in them the sin which he would have deservedly condemned. This doctrine gives us alacrity in our desire to do rightly, since God so graciously pardons our infirmities; and, at the same time, it warns us most carefully to be on our guard, lest, when we are desirous of doing well, some sin should creep in to obscure, and thus to contaminate our good work; since 				it not unfrequently happens that those whose aim is right, halt or stumble or wander in the way to it. In fine, whosoever honestly examines himself, will find some defect even in his best endeavors. Moreover, by the rewards of God, let us be encouraged to the confidence of thus obtaining good success, lest we should faint at the dangers we incur by the faithful performance of our duty; and assuredly no danger will alarm us, if this thought be deeply impressed upon our hearts, that whatever 				ill-will our good deeds may beget in this world, still God sits in heaven to reward them.</p>

The tyrant, finding that his snares and deceit availed nothing, now shakes off fear and flies to open violence, commanding the little ones to be torn from the breasts of their mothers and to be cast into the river. Lest there should be any lack of executioners, he gives this charge to all the Egyptians, whom he knew to be more than ready for the work. He spares the daughters, that, being enslaved and allotted to the Egyptians, they might produce slaves for their masters, whilst by them the races and names could not be preserved. Here it may be worth while to meditate on a comparison with our own times. Antichrist, with all his murderous agents, leaves in peace those who by their treacherous 				silence deny Christ, and are prepared to embrace as slaves every kind of impiety; neither does he exercise his cruelty, insatiable though it be, where he sees no manliness to exist; and he exults and triumphs, as if his end was gained, when he perceives any who had some courage in professing their faith fallen into effeminacy and cowardice. But how much better is it for us to die an hundred times, retaining our manly firmness in death, than to redeem our life for the base service of the 				devil.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.i.i-p20"></A><a name="iv.i.i-p20.1"></A> It may he noticed, once for all, that Calvin&#8217;s references to Rabbinical expositions of supposed difficulties are generally references to what Sebastian Munster had inserted at the close of each chapter of his version of the Old Testament, which is described as follows in the title-page to its second edition, Basle, 1546: <a name="iv.i.i-p20.2"></A>&#8212; <a name="iv.i.i-p20.3"></A>&#8220;En 					 tibi Lector Hebraica Biblia, Latina planeque nova Sebast. Munsteri tralatione, post omnes omnium hactenus ubivis gentium editiones evulgata, et quoad fieri potuit Hebraicae veritati conformata: adjectis insuper e Rabbinorum commentariis annotationibus.&#8221; The notion that Jochebed was included in the enumeration, is mentioned by <i>S.M</i><a name="iv.i.i-p20.4"></A>. in the annotations on <a name="iv.i.i-p20.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#027">Ge 46:27</a><a name="iv.i.i-p20.5"></A><a name="iv.i.i-p20.6"></A>. In that verse, as given in our authorized version, <i>which came </i><a name="iv.i.i-p20.7"></A>must be understood to agree with <i>house</i><a name="iv.i.i-p20.8"></A>, <a name="iv.i.i-p20.9"></A>the Hebrew being <a name="iv.i.i-p20.10"></A>&#1492;&#1499;&#1488;&#1492;<a name="iv.i.i-p20.11"></A>. The persons of that house properly of Jacob&#8217;s own blood were seventy in number, 					 as appears from the enumeration in that chapter, including a daughter (v. 15) and a granddaughter, (v. 17.) The number in Stephen&#8217;s speech is supposed by many to be taken from the Septuagint, which says that nine souls were born to Joseph in Egypt, and so makes the whole amount seventy-five, both in <a name="iv.i.i-p20.12"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#000">Genesis 46</a><a name="iv.i.i-p20.12"></A> and in <a name="iv.i.i-p20.13"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#000">Exodus 1</a><a name="iv.i.i-p20.13"></A>. But Stephen spoke of the number of his kindred whom Joseph sent for, and may reasonably be supposed to have meant thereby Jacob and his eleven sons, with their wives and 					 fifty-three male children, which would amount to seventy-five souls. &#8212; <i>W</i></p> 				</P>
