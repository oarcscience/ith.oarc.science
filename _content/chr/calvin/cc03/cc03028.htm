<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="v.iii-p12"></A><b>36.</b> <i>I am the Lord your God.</i> In these first four passages he treats of the same points which we have observed in the preface to the Law; for he reasons partly from God&#8217;s authority, that the law should be reverently obeyed, because the Creator of heaven and earth justly claims supreme 			 dominion; and, partly, he sets before them the blessing of redemption, that they may willingly submit themselves to His law, from whom they have obtained their safety. For, whenever God calls Himself Jehovah, it should suggest His majesty, before which all ought to be humbled; whilst redemption should of itself produce voluntary submission. At the beginning he repeats the same words which he had lately used; and thence exhorts them to observe His statutes and judgments, <i>i.e., </i>treasure them diligently in their minds. Afterwards he reminds them wherefore they ought attentively to observe the Law, viz, that they may perform the works which God therein requires. Nor is it without a reason that at the end of the second verse He declares Himself to be Jehovah, because it is not easy either to subdue rebellious minds or to retain fickle ones in the fear of God. In the next verse, the qualification &#8220;which<i> 			 </i>sanctify you&#8221; is added, to arouse them earnestly to prove their gratitude to God, who has by peculiar privilege separated them from the rest of mankind.</p>
