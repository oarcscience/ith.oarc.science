<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="iv.xii.i-p19"></A><a name="iv.xii.i-p19.1"></A>I have here omitted what Moses has related in the beginning of the chapter up to this verse, because it pertains to the perpetual doctrine of the Law. I shall hereafter insert it in its proper place. But., since here also God gave precepts as to the observation of the Passover, I have thought it right to interweave them with the history; because Moses does not merely teach here what God would have observed by His people 				in all ages, but relates what He required on a particular occasion. But my readers are to be reminded that some precepts are temporary, and some perpetual, like the Law itself. Of this we may see a clear and familiar example in the chapter before us. For up to this place, Moses had explained what; would be the due observation of the Passover year by year for ever; but now he only relates historically, that, on the night in which the people went forth, they celebrated the Passover according&#8217; to 				God&#8217;s command. I shall, therefore, lightly touch upon what is here repeated; since a more fitting place for a full exposition will be, when we come to the doctrine of the law. The word <a name="iv.xii.i-p19.2"></A>&#1508;&#1505;&#1492;<a name="iv.xii.i-p19.3"></A>,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">140</FONT></A>
 				 <i>pesech, </i><a name="iv.xii.i-p20.6"></A>means a <i>passing-over, </i><a name="iv.xii.i-p20.7"></A>not of the people, (as many have falsely thought,) but of God Himself, who passed over the houses of the Israelites without harm, when He slew the first-born in all Egypt. Since, then, the wrath of God, which then like a deluge covered the whole of Egypt, left the Israelites untouched, He instituted a memorial of His <i>passing-over, </i><a name="iv.xii.i-p20.8"></A>whereby they had been preserved in safety amidst the public destruction of the whole land. He is also said to have passed-over the Egyptians, whom He deprived of their first-born; but after a different manner, because He spared His chosen ones, as if they had been far away, or protected in places of sure refuge.</p>  			 
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.xii.i-p21"></A><b>21.</b> <i>Then Moses called for all the elders.</i> His address is especially directed to the elders, that they might afterwards repeat it to the multitude; for he could not have been heard at the same time by so great a number of people. But, although the 				disorganization of the people had been terrible under that severe tyranny, still God willed that certain relics of order should be preserved, and did not suffer those, whom He had adopted, to be deprived of all government. This also had been an availing means of preserving their unity, so that the chosen seed of Abraham should not be lost. But Moses here only speaks of the sprinkling of the blood; because he had already addressed them as to the eating of the lamb. He therefore commands branches 				of hyssop to be dipped in the blood, which had been caught in the basin, and every one&#8217;s lintel and two side-posts to be sprinkled with this. By which sign God testified that He will preserve His people from the common destruction, because they will be discerned from the wicked by the mark of blood. For it was necessary that the Israelites should first be reminded, that by the expiation of the sacrifice, they were delivered from the plague, and their houses preserved untouched; and, secondly, 				that the sacrifice would profit them, only if its conspicuous sign existed among them. We elsewhere see that the Paschal lamb was a type of Christ, who by His death propitiated His Father, so that we should not perish with the rest of the world. But, already of old time, He desired to bear witness to the ancients under the Law, that He would not be reconciled to them otherwise than through the sacrifice of a victim. And there is no doubt that by this visible symbol He raised up their minds to 				that true and heavenly Exemplar, whom it would be absurd and profane to separate from the ceremonies of the law. For what could be more childish than to offer the blood of an animal as a protection against the hand of God, or to seek from thence a ground of safety? God, then, shows that He spares the Israelites on no other condition but that of sacrifice; from whence it follows, that the death of Christ was set before them in this ordinance, which alone constituted the difference between them 				and the Egyptians. But at the same time He taught that no advantage was to be expected from the blood poured forth, without the sprinkling; not that the external and visible sprinkling produced any good effect, but because by this familiar rite it was useful that the ignorant should be brought to perceive the truth, and that they might know that what was put before them Visibly must be spiritually fulfilled. It is notorious from the testimony of Peter, (<a name="iv.xii.i-p21.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002">1Pe 1:2</a><a name="iv.xii.i-p21.2"></A>,) that our souls are sprinkled with the blood of Christ by the Spirit. This was typified by the bunch of hyssop,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">141</FONT></A>
 				 which herb possesses great cleansing power, and therefore, was often used in other sacrifices also, as we shall hereafter see in the proper places.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.xii.i-p23"></A><a name="iv.xii.i-p23.1"></A></p>  			 
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.xii.i-p24"></A><b>23.</b> <i>For the Lord will pass through.</i> He forbids them to go out during the night, lest they should mix themselves with the Egyptians, but commands them to keep quietly under the protection of the blood. By this sign they were admonished that they also were exposed to destruction, if 				they did not separate themselves from the unbelievers under the safeguard of the blood. Afterwards the promise: is added, that, provided this were done, the angel would pass them over, and inflict no injury upon them, because God would acknowledge the houses so marked as His own. Wherefore, it is again repeated, that they should alone be safe by the blessing of the blood, who should not neglect to sprinkle themselves with it; because faith alone confers upon us the salvation which is obtained 				by the slaughter of the victim. The angel, whom God had delegated for afflicting Egypt, is here undoubtedly called &#8220;the destroyer;&#8221; and, although He often executes His judgments by evil angels, it is to be gathered from other passages that this was one of the elect angels, who also was the minister of the people&#8217;s deliverance under Christ as the Head.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="iv.xii.i-p26"></A><b>25.</b> <i>When ye come into the land.</i> <a name="iv.xii.i-p26.1"></A>He now adds that this rite must be annually observed, in order that the memory of this extraordinary grace might never perish. But since a commandment is given respecting the continual observation   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_141"><FONT SIZE="1">142</FONT></A>
 				<a name="iv.xii.i-p27.1"></A> of the Sabbath, I postpone its explanation to a more appropriate place; except I would cursorily remark, that the proclamation of the blessing is annexed to the sign; because otherwise it would be an empty and unmeaning proceeding. God, therefore, would have the fathers proclaim it unto their children, so that the knowledge of their redemption, being handed down by tradition, may flourish in all ages. The word <a name="iv.xii.i-p27.2"></A>&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;<a name="iv.xii.i-p27.3"></A>,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">143</FONT></A>
 				 <i>gnebod, </i><a name="iv.xii.i-p28.4"></A>some have improperly rendered &#8220;work,&#8221; whereas it is rather used for &#8220;worship;&#8221; as in many passages to serve God means the same as to worship Him. We too, in French, call whatever relates to the exercises of piety &#8220;God&#8217;s service.&#8221; Finally, Moses adds that the people professed their faith and obedience by solemn adoration. This indeed they had already done from the beginning, but with little constancy, 				because they had been so harassed by their afflictions as to neglect their duty; but now they correct the fault of ingratitude. Therefore, they not only declare their feelings of seriousness by bowing the head, but give actual proof of them; for it is expressly said, that they diligently performed whatever was commanded.</p>  <a name="iv.xii.ii"></A>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.xii.ii-p25"></A><b>29.</b> <i>And it came to pass, that at midnight.</i> Lest the hand of God should be hidden in this miracle, as well in the preservation of the people as in taking vengeance upon the Egyptians, Moses sets forth its power by many circumstances. For he both relates that the destruction took 				place at midnight, which was the time prescribed by God, and then adds, that all the first-born of the land were smitten, from the son of the king to the son of the captive in the dungeon. It is thus that he indicates proverbially the most abject persons, as he had said before, &#8220;unto the first-born of the maidservant that is behind the mill.&#8221; For it could only be by an extraordinary miracle that this calamity could affect every house without exception, at the same hour, especially when it 				extended even to the beasts. <i>Thirdly, </i>he recounts that all the Egyptians were aroused suddenly, and manifestly convinced that the God of Israel was wroth with them. <i>Fourthly, </i>that Pharaoh humbly prayed of Moses to lead forth the people in haste; nay, that he even importunately thrust them out. Yet not even by such clear and solid proofs has the dishonesty and impudence of some been prevented from 				attempting to upset by their falsehoods this memorable work of God. The calumnies are too well known which Josephus refutes in his reply to Apion the Grammarian; and it appears from Justin   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">144</FONT></A>
 				 that they were generally received. Nor can we wonder that the devil should have employed all sorts of artifices, so that by the introduction of various fables he might efface from men&#8217;s minds the redemption of the Church. But here also was manifested the admirable wisdom of God, that the futility of these absurdities refutes itself, without the use of any arguments against them. Perhaps there was no intention to deceive on the part of profane writers, when they 				reported these frivolous and silly stories about the Jews; for doubtless Strabo   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">145</FONT></A>
 				 desired to give the true history of the origin of circumcision when he wrote his foolish and unfounded fables. Nor did even Cornelius Tacitus,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">146</FONT></A>
 				 although he wrote with malignant and virulent feelings, intentionally put himself to shame; but when by the impulse of Satan they obscured God&#8217;s glory, they were smitten with blindness and folly, so that their ridiculous want of truth might be discovered even by children; from whence, however, some sparks of fact may still be elicited, because God would not suffer so memorable an operation to be altogether forgotten, of which these blind men were the proclaimers, 				when the devil was using their aid to obliterate its memory.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.xii.ii-p30"></A><b>31.</b> <i>And he called for Moses.</i> It is not probable that God&#8217;s servants were recalled into the presence of Pharaoh; but the sense of this passage must be sought for in the prediction of Moses. Pharaoh, therefore, is said to have called them, when, by sending to them his chief 				courtiers, he compelled their departure. And this is sufficiently proved by the context, because it is immediately added, that the Israelites were by the Egyptians compelled to go out: in haste. Therefore, although Pharaoh never should have seen Moses from the time that he threatened him with death if he came to him again, there is nothing absurd in saying that he called for him when he sent his nobles to him with his command. The perturbation of an alarmed and anxious person is expressed to 				the life in these words, &#8212; &#8220;Rise up, get you forth, both ye and your children; go, serve the Lord; also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said.&#8221; For he takes no less precaution lest he should give any occasion for delay, than he had before been diligent in bargaining. Whilst, then, he hastily cuts off all objections, the change in the man betrays itself, for the same God who had before hardened his iron heart has now broken it. Hence, too, that cry &#8212; the signal of despair &#8212; &#8220;We be all 				dead men;&#8221; hence, too, their readiness to give willingly of their substance, and to dress up in spoils those whom they had pillaged before. Nor indeed does he without reason repeat that this favor proceeded from divine inspiration, since there would never have been such liberality in robbers as willingly to proffer whatever precious things their houses possessed, and to give them to the Israelites, now ready to depart, whom they knew to be justly hostile to them on account of so many injuries. 				And that the children of Israel should be so prompt to obey, who before had been either slow, or inconstant, or sullen, or rebellious, was brought about by the guidance of the Spirit, who turned their hearts in a moment; since God well knew how to dispose opportunely all the springs of action.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.xii.ii-p32"></A><b>37.</b> <i>And the children of Israel journeyed.</i> Although it is probable that they were more widely dispersed, since that district could not have contained so great a multitude, especially when the Egyptians occupied it together with them; still because the recollection of the promise 				remained among them, from whence some hope of their redemption always was preserved, it is not wonderful that they should have preferred to be kept within narrow bounds, to their great inconvenience, rather than, by seeking other habitations, to separate from the main body. That this was the peculiar abode of the nation is plain also from what has gone before, where Moses related that they were forced to servile tasks in building those fortified cities wherein they might be shut up, as in 				prison. In the number of men which he reports, he commends the incredible miracle of God&#8217;s favor in increasing and multiplying their race. Thus is the effrontery of the impious refuted who think it a sufficient ground for their sneers, that this great people could not in so short a time have naturally proceeded from a single family; and therefore they burst out into unrestrained and blasphemous laughter, as if Moses were simply relating what had happened, and not rather extolling the 				extraordinary power of God in the sudden increase of His Church. But we know that it was no more a matter of difficulty for the Creator of the whole world to exceed the ordinary course of nature, in the multiplication of a particular nation, than at the beginning to produce speedily many people from one man and woman; and again, after the deluge, to renew the human race by a miraculous augmentation. Now, this is the peculiar character of the Church, that in producing and preserving it, God 				exerts unusual power, that it may be separated from the common condition of mankind; for although it sojourns on earth, yet is its nature in a manner heavenly, that the work of God may shine forth more brightly in it. No wonder then if, contrary to usual custom, it should emerge, as it were, from nothing, if it grows in the same way and makes continual progress. Such an example does Paul set before us in <a name="iv.xii.ii-p32.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#000">Romans 4</a><a name="iv.xii.ii-p32.1"></A>., in the person of Abraham. But whilst the impious despisers of God betray their 				stupidity in their wicked audacity, when they estimate this work of God by their own senses and by common reason, so, too, do they foolishly err who attempt to defend Moses by philosophical arguments; for his intention was very different, viz., to show that the promises were not unfulfilled, &#8220;I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore,&#8221; (<a name="iv.xii.ii-p32.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017">Ge 22:17</a><a name="iv.xii.ii-p32.2"></A>, and <a name="iv.xii.ii-p32.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002">Ge 12:2</a><a name="iv.xii.ii-p32.3"></A>, and <a name="iv.xii.ii-p32.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005">Ge 15:5</a><a name="iv.xii.ii-p32.4"></A>,) the effect of which promises was beyond human comprehension.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.xii.ii-p34"></A><b>38.</b> <i>And a mixed multitude.</i> Although Abraham possessed many servants, yet is it scarcely probable that in the famine Jacob maintained any other persons in his family besides his own children, whom he could hardly so sustain as to preserve them from dying of hunger. And since 				Moses, in relating their coming into Egypt, does not mention any servants, we may conjecture that they brought no great number, because necessity compelled them to be content at any rate with a few. From hence we gather that the mixed multitude, which united themselves with the Israelites, were either the offspring of Egypt, or had migrated from the neighboring countries to take up their habitation there; as fertile lands often attract many strangers to them by the pleasures of abundance. The 				same expression is used in <a name="iv.xii.ii-p34.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#003">Ne 13:3</a><a name="iv.xii.ii-p34.1"></A>, where it is said that &#8220;the mixed multitude&#8221; was separated from the true Israelites, lest all should promiscuously arrogate to themselves the same dignity, and, thus the Church should be polluted by a confused admixture, But if any should think it absurd that ungodly men, with no better hope before them, would voluntarily forsake a rich and 				convenient habitation in order to seek a new home as wanderers and pilgrims, let him recollect that Egypt had now been afflicted by so many calamities that by its very poverty and devastation it might easily have driven away its inhabitants. A great part of the cattle had perished; all the fruits of the earth were corrupted; the fields were ravaged and almost desert; we need not, therefore, wonder if despair should have caused many sojourners to fly away, and even some of the natives 				themselves. It may be also that, having been inhumanly treated, they shook off the yoke of tyranny when a way to liberty was opened to them.</p>  			 
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.xii.ii-p35"></A>But although God gave His people a ready departure, still He did not choose to let them go out altogether without any inconvenience; for they go not out satiated with food, nor having delicately supped, but are compelled to carry in their bags unbaked masses of dough, that they may eat bread burned or toasted on the embers in their journey. By this example we are taught that God&#8217;s blessings are always mingled with certain inconveniences, 				lest too great delight should corrupt the minds of the godly.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.xii.ii-p48"></A><b>40.</b> <i>Now the sojourning of the children of Israel.</i> The beginning of this period is not reckoned from the coming down of Jacob, for it is very clear from other passages, that, from the time that Jacob entered into Egypt to the Exodus, not more than 230 years at most had 				passed.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">147</FONT></A>
 				 The Jews generally only reckon 210; but Moses includes also the period during which Abraham and his children were not in possession of the promised land. The meaning therefore is, that from the time that the inheritance of the land of Canaan was given to Abraham, the promise was suspended for 400, years before his posterity enjoyed their right. For Paul also thus explains this difficulty, (<a name="iv.xii.ii-p49.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001">Ga 3:1</a><a name="iv.xii.ii-p49.1"></A>,) where he says, that God had confirmed his covenant with Abraham 430 years before the law was promulgated. Moses, therefore, dates the commencement of this period from the sojourning of Abraham, when he was still the lord of the land of Canaan by the just title of donation. With respect to the omission of the thirty years in the 15th chapter of Genesis, in this there is no contradiction, because the land had already been promised 				to Abraham some years previously, though, so far from obtaining dominion over it, he had scarcely been permitted to occupy it as &#8220;a stranger.&#8221; Therefore God apprizes him, that 400 years still remained before he would put his descendants into possession of it; and, consequently, that the little time which had elapsed was not sufficient for the trial of his patience, but that both for himself and for his posterity there was need of extraordinary endurance, lest they should faint under the 				weariness of the long delay. Moreover, there is no departure from the usual manner of speaking, in His not exactly reckoning the number of years. More than 400 years, some twenty, or thereabouts, indeed, remained; but, since God had no other object than to exhort His people to patience, He does not accurately compute or define the exact number of years, because it was sufficient to put before them 400 years in a round sum. In the same way, it is added in the next verse, &#8220;at the end of 430 				years,&#8221; viz., from the time that Abraham had begun to be the legitimate lord of the land; for Moses wished to show, that although God had long delayed the fulfillment of His promise, still His truth and faithfulness were certainly proved, not only because He had precisely performed what He had proraised, but because He had observed the: foreappointed time. He calls the people, weak as they were, by an honorable title, &#8220;the hosts of the Lord,&#8221; both to enforce again the power of God&#8217;s blessing, 				and to give due honor to His grace in ruling and marshalling so confused a band. Although soldiers may be accustomed to obedience, and have learnt from exercise to keep their ranks; although they may have generals, commandants, and captains, and banners also under which to range themselves, still it is a very difficult thing to march an army of 20,000, or 30,000 men by night without. confusion, and in good order; how great a miracle was it, then, for 600,000 men, with women and children, much 				baggage, herds, and flocks, and other encumbrances, to pass by night through the midst of enemies, and all to escape safely without a single exception! To the same effect, Moses repeats in the last verse of this chapter, that &#8220;the Lord did bring the children of Israel out &#8212; by their armies,&#8221; as much as to say, that there was no confusion in that immense multitude; since God performed the part of an incomparable Leader in His marvelous power.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.xii.ii-p51"></A><b>42.</b> <i>It is a night to be much observed.</i> He shows that the Israelites have good cause for sacrificing to God with a solemn ceremony year by year for ever, and for celebrating the memory of that night; and that the Passover was instituted in token of their gratitude. But this 				admonition was very useful, in order that the Israelites should retain the legitimate use of this solemn feast-day, and that it might not grow into a mere cold ceremony, as is often the case; but that rather they might profitably, and to the advancement of their piety, exercise themselves in this emblem of their redemption. At the same time, he teaches that this so inestimable a benefit was not to be celebrated in one, or two, or three generations, but that as long as the people should remain 				it was worthy of eternal remembrance, and that it might never be forgotten, the Passover was to be sacredly observed.</p>  			 
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="iv.xii.ii-p52"></A>Moreover we must remark, that the generations of the ancient people were brought to an end by the coming of Christ; because the shadows of the Law ceased when the state of the Church was renewed, and the Gentiles were gathered into the same body.</p>

But it is not so much their promptitude and alacrity 				which are praised, as the wondrous power of God in fashioning their hearts, and directing their hands, so that, in the darkness of the night, amidst the greatest disturbances, in precipitate haste, with nothing well prepared, they were so active and dexterous. Meanwhile, Moses concludes, from the obedience of the people, that nothing was done without the command and guidance of God; from whence it is more clearly manifest that He was the sole author of their deliverance.</p>
