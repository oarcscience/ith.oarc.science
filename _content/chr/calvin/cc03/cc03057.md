<span id="v.xxxii-p3"></span>**1.** These *be* the words which Moses
spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the
plain over against the Red *sea,* between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban,
and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.

<span id="v.xxxii-p4"></span>**1.** Haec sunt verba quae loquutus est
Moses ad omnem Israelem trans Jordanem in deserto, in planitie, e
regione Suph, inter Paran et Thophel, et Laban, et Hazeroth, et Dizahab.

<span id="v.xxxii-p5"></span>**2.** *(There are* eleven *days’ journey*
from Horeb, by the way of mount Seir, unto Kadeshbarnea.)

<span id="v.xxxii-p6"></span>**2.** Undecim dies sunt ab Horeb, itineris
montis Seir, usque ad Cades Barnea.

<span id="v.xxxii-p7"></span>**3.** And it came to pass in the fortieth
year, in the eleventh month, on the first *day* of the month, *that*
Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the
Lord had given him in commandment unto them;

<span id="v.xxxii-p8"></span>**3.** Fuit autem quadragesimo anno,
undecimo mense, prima mensis, loquutus est Moses ad filios Israel juxta
omnia quae praeceperat Jehova ad illos.

<span id="v.xxxii-p9"></span>**4.** After he had slain Sihon the king of
the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which
dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei.

<span id="v.xxxii-p10"></span>**4.** Posteaquam percusserat Sehon regem
Emorrhaeorum qui habitabat in Hesbon, et Og regem Basan, qui habitabat
in Astaroth in Edrei.

<span id="v.xxxii-p11"></span>**5.** On this side Jordan, in the land of
Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying.

<span id="v.xxxii-p12"></span>**5.** Trans Jordanem in terra Moab
incepit Moses explanare legem hanc, dicendo.

<span id="v.xxxii-p13"></span><span id="v.xxxii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="v.xxxii-p14"></span>**1.** *These are the words.* These two
latter passages properly belong to the *supplements,* wherein God
afterwards more clearly and familiarly illustrated the Law previously
given by Him; they comprehend also exhortations, by which He subdued the
people’s minds to obedience, and eulogies, by which He commended and
confirmed the Law. The sum is, that Moses is appointed the minister and
ambassador of God, who by his mouth prescribes to Israel all that is
right and just. But when he says, “beside the covenant, which he made
with them in Horeb,” (<span id="v.xxxii-p14.1"></span>[De
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#001)<span id="v.xxxii-p14.1"></span>,)
necessary that the Decalogue should be more fully explained, lest its
brevity should render it obscure to an ignorant and slow-hearted people.
For God did not, like earthly kings, learn from experience to enrich His
law by new precepts, but considered the people’s dull and weak
understanding. The particle of exception, “beside,” does not, therefore,
designate anything additional, but only signifies that God had again
repeated His covenant, that it might be more distinctly and certainly
understood. In which respect He gave an extraordinary proof of His
indulgence, that previous to their entering the land, He renewed His
covenant about forty years after its first promulgation, and added a
clear exposition of it, because He had then to do with a new generation.
For this reason the place is expressly mentioned, because from thence
the lapse of time is made evident.
