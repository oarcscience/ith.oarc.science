<span id="v.xi-p1"></span>DEUTERONOMY 27

<span id="v.xi-p2"></span><span id="v.xi-p2.1"></span>[Deut.
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#009),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#010)<span id="v.xi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="v.xi-p3"></span>**9.** And Moses, and the priests the Levites,
spake unto all Israel, saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; This
day thou art become the people of the Lord thy God.

<span id="v.xi-p4"></span>**9.** Et loquutus est Moses et sacerdotes
Levitae ad omnem Israel, dicendo, Ausculta et audi Israel, hodie factus
es in populum Jehovae Deo tuo.

<span id="v.xi-p5"></span>**10.** Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of
the Lord thy God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I
command thee this day.

<span id="v.xi-p6"></span>**10.** Audias ergo vocem Dei tui, et facias
praecepta ejus, et statuta ejus quae ego praecipio tibi hodie.

<span id="v.xi-p7"></span><span id="v.xi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="v.xi-p8"></span>The ground of his exhortation is again taken
from the special favor of adoption, wherewith the God of Abraham had
honored them; for there was nothing which should have more *effectually*
stimulated them to obedience, than that more than paternal love, and the
gratuitous kindness with which He had prevented them. Although, at the
same time, they were admonished in these words of the object for which
they were separated from other nations; for the conclusion he draws is,
that because they were received by God as His people, they, therefore,
lay under an obligation to keep His statutes; as Paul more plainly
teaches us that we are redeemed from all iniquity, that Christ might
purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. (<span
id="v.xi-p8.1"></span>Titus 2:14.) Moreover, since the priests were now
appointed, from whose lips the doctrine of the law was to be sought,
they here come forward in God’s own name, and engage the people to
respond to His generous calls upon them; and not only this, but also to
obey His ministers.
