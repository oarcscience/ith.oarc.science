<span id="xx-p1"></span>APPENDIX OF ADDITIONAL ANNOTATIONS.

<span id="xx.i"></span>

<span id="xx.i-p1"></span>APPENDIX A

<span id="xx.i-p2"></span>**Chapter 1:3** *Who being the brightness,
etc.* The words are rendered by *Beza,* “the effulgence of his glory,
and the impress of his person;” by *Doddridge,* “the effulgent ray of
his glory, and the express delineation of his person;” *by Macknight,*
“an effulgence of his glory, and an exact image of his substance;” and
by *Stuart,* “the radiance of his glory, and the exact image of his
substance.” The word “brightness,” does not adequately express the
meaning of the first word, ἀπαύγασμα, which signifies an emitted light,
a splendor proceeding from an object. The most suitable word would be,
outshining, or irradiation, “the outshining of his glory.” The “express
image” of our version is the impress, the engraven or impressed form,
derived from the archetype. And “impress,” as given by *Beza,* fully
expresses it.

<span id="xx.i-p3"></span>The words are doubtless metaphorical, but the
idea is this — that Christ, as a Mediator, as the Son of God in human
nature, exactly represents what God is, being the very image of him who
is invisible. “Substance,” or essence, is the divine nature in all its
glorious and incomprehensible attributes of power, wisdom, holiness,
justice, and goodness. These and other perfections are exhibited in
Christ perfectly, and in such a way that we can look on them, and in a
measure understand them. Hence he said, “He that hath seen me, hath seen
the Father,” <span id="xx.i-p3.1"></span>[Joh
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009)<span id="xx.i-p3.1"></span>.

<span id="xx.i-p4"></span>The word ὑπόστασις, does not mean a “person,”
either in Scripture or in classic writers. It is a meaning invented by
the fathers during the Arian controversy. As used in the *Sept.* and in
the New Testament, it means foundation or basis, <span
id="xx.i-p4.1"></span>[Eze 43:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#011)<span
id="xx.i-p4.1"></span>, — substance, <span id="xx.i-p4.2"></span>[Ps
139:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#015)<span id="xx.i-p4.2"></span>, —
expectation, <span id="xx.i-p4.3"></span>[Ps
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#011)<span id="xx.i-p4.3"></span>, —
and confidence, <span id="xx.i-p4.4"></span>[2Co
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#004)<span id="xx.i-p4.4"></span>. Its
classic meaning, according to *Stuart,* is foundation, steadfastness,
courage, purpose, resolution, determination, substance, essence, being.
There is in <span id="xx.i-p4.5"></span>[Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015)<span id="xx.i-p4.5"></span>, a
phrase of a similar import, with “the impress of his substance,” where
Christ is said to be “the image (εἴχων — the likeness) of the invisible
God.” The substance or essence is “the invisible God,” and “the impress”
is “the image.”

<span id="xx.i-p5"></span>“In the opinion,” says *Stuart,* “that the
verse now under consideration relates to the incarnate Messiah, and not
to the Logos in his divine nature simply considered, I find that Scott
and Beza concur, not to mention others of the most respectable
commentators.”

<span id="xx.i-p6"></span>It was the mistaken view which the fathers
took of the passage that led them to invent a new meaning to the word
ὑπόστασις; and many have followed them.

<span id="xx.ii"></span>

<span id="xx.ii-p1"></span>APPENDIX B

<span id="xx.ii-p2"></span>**Chapter 1:5.** *Thou art my Son, etc*. It
is to be observed that Christ *is* called a Son when his prophetic
office is referred to, <span id="xx.ii-p2.1"></span>[Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002)<span id="xx.ii-p2.1"></span>, when
spoken of as a king, <span id="xx.ii-p2.2"></span>[Heb
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008)<span id="xx.ii-p2.2"></span>, when
his priesthood is mentioned, <span id="xx.ii-p2.3"></span>[Heb
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005)<span id="xx.ii-p2.3"></span>, and
when a comparison is made between him and Moses, <span
id="xx.ii-p2.4"></span>[Heb 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006)<span
id="xx.ii-p2.4"></span>. But as a king over his people is he represented
here as superior to angels; and David as his type was also called a son
because he was a king. Christ is said here to have derived his name by
“inheritance” — from whom? The Apostle refers throughout to the Old
Testament; and what does Peter say That David, being a Prophet, knew
that God “would raise up Christ to sit *on his* throne,” <span
id="xx.ii-p2.5"></span>[Ac 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030)<span
id="xx.ii-p2.5"></span>. Then the inheritance in this instance was from
David. Christ is God’s *only­begotten* Son as to his divine nature; but
he is also a Son in a peculiar manner, superior to all others, that is,
as a Prophet, Priest, and King. There were types of him in these
offices; but they were only types, and therefore far inferior to him
even as to these offices. And angels never sustained such offices.

<span id="xx.iii"></span>

<span id="xx.iii-p1"></span>APPENDIX C

<span id="xx.iii-p2"></span>**Chapter 1:6** *And again when he bringeth,
etc* Critics have found some difficulty in the order in which the
particles are arranged here, and have proposed a transposition, which is
not at all necessary. The word “first­begotten,” or first­born, seems to
have been used on account of what the previous verse contains. The
words, “Today have I begotten thee,” refer clearly to the resurrection;
and Christ is said to have been “the first­born from the dead,” <span
id="xx.iii-p2.1"></span>[Col 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018)<span
id="xx.iii-p2.1"></span>. Having then referred to Christ’s resurrection,
he now as it were goes back to his birth, or to the announcement made in
prophecy of his coming into the world, and seems to say, that not only
when he became the first­born from the dead he attained a manifested
superiority over angels, but even at his first introduction into the
world, for they were commanded even to worship him. “And when again,” or
also, or moreover, “he introduces,” etc.; as though he had said, “God
owned him as his Son by raising him from the dead; and again, or in
addition to this, when he introduced him into the world, he commanded
the angels to worship him.” So that the subordination of angels was
evident before his resurrection, even at his very introduction into the
world.

<span id="xx.iii-p3"></span>*Stuart* considers his introduction to be
his birth, and regards the words, “and let all the angels of God worship
him,” as borrowed, though not literally, from <span
id="xx.iii-p3.1"></span>[Ps 97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007)<span
id="xx.iii-p3.1"></span>, to express what is intimated in the account of
his birth, <span id="xx.iii-p3.2"></span>[Lu
2:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#010)<span id="xx.iii-p3.2"></span>.
The Hebrews, written to, were, he supposes, acquainted with that event.

<span id="xx.iii-p4"></span>This is the view taken by some of the
fathers, *Chrysostom* and others. But some, as *Mede,* thinking the
quotation a prophecy, consider that his second coming is intended, as
the contents of the Psalm were deemed to be descriptive of the day of
judgment. A third party, as Dr. *Owen,* view the introduction to be
Christ’s birth, and consider the Psalm as giving an allegorical
description of the progress of the Gospel in the world; and this seems
to be the view taken by *Calvin,* and is apparently the most consistent.

<span id="xx.iii-p5"></span>The difference in the quotation is quite
immaterial. The words in the Psalm are, “Worship him all gods,” or
rather angels; for so is the word sometimes rendered. The version of the
*Sept.* is*,* “Worship him all ye his angels;” and here “God “is put
instead of “his.”

<span id="xx.iv"></span>

<span id="xx.iv-p1"></span>APPENDIX D

<span id="xx.iv-p2"></span>**Chapter 1:10.** *Thou, Lord, etc.* The
quotation is literally from the *Sept.,* only the order of the words in
the first sentence is changed; and it is literally the Hebrew, except
that σὺ χύζιε are added. The Hebrew is, “Of old the earth hast thou
founded, and the work of thy hands are the heavens.”

<span id="xx.iv-p3"></span>Nothing can more clearly prove the *divine*
nature of Christ than this quotation; and it settles at once the meaning
of αἰω̑νας*;* in <span id="xx.iv-p3.1"></span>[Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002)<span id="xx.iv-p3.1"></span>, as
it confirms the truth that Christ, the Messiah, being not only the Son
but also the only­begotten of God, is the Creator of the world, even the
earth and the heavens, as here stated. Nor can the word have any other
meaning in <span id="xx.iv-p3.2"></span>[Heb.
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026), [Heb.
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003)<span id="xx.iv-p3.2"></span>

<span id="xx.iv-p4"></span>It is generally admitted that this Psalm
refers to Christ; and Dr. *Owen* mentions three particulars in proof of
this, — the redemption of the Church, <span id="xx.iv-p4.1"></span>[Ps.
102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#016)<span id="xx.iv-p4.1"></span>, —
the call of the Gentiles, <span id="xx.iv-p4.2"></span>[Ps.
102:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#015),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#021)<span id="xx.iv-p4.2"></span>, —
and the creation of a new people, <span id="xx.iv-p4.3"></span>[Ps
102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018)<span id="xx.iv-p4.3"></span>;
and he adds, that the Jews themselves refer the last thing to the time
of the Messiah.

<span id="xx.iv-p5"></span>Referring to the words, “as a vesture,” the
same author beautifully observes, that the whole creation is like God’s
vesture, by which he shews himself to men in his power and wisdom, and
that hence it is said, that he “clothes himself with light as with a
garment,” <span id="xx.iv-p5.1"></span>[Ps
104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002)<span id="xx.iv-p5.1"></span>.

<span id="xx.v"></span>

<span id="xx.v-p1"></span>APPENDIX E

<span id="xx.v-p2"></span>**Chapter 1:14** *Are they not all ministering
spirits, etc* It is said of Christ also, that he was a minister or a
servant; but while he was a servant, he was at the same time the Lord of
all, which cannot be said of angels. Yet as a servant he was superior to
them; for he became so in a work which they were not capable of doing.
So that as a servant a superiority belongs to him. But his office as a
servant is not contemplated here. Indeed all the names given to him, in
common either with men on earth or with angels in heaven, mean very
different things when applied to him; such as son, servant, priest,
king, Savior, etc.

<span id="xx.v-p3"></span>It ought to be born in mind that throughout
this chapter Christ is spoken of in his character of a Mediator, and not
as to his divine nature simply considered, and that the reference is
made, as to his superiority over angels, to the testimonies in the Old
Testament. He is in this chapter represented as superior to angels, —

<span id="xx.v-p4"></span>**1.** Because he is called in a peculiar
respect a Son.

<span id="xx.v-p5"></span>**2.** Because angels were commanded to
worship him.

<span id="xx.v-p6"></span>**3.** Because he is addressed as having an
eternal throne, and being honored more than all his associates as a
king.

<span id="xx.v-p7"></span>**4.** Because he is the Creator of the world.

<span id="xx.v-p8"></span>**5.** And lastly, because there is a promise
made to him that all his enemies shall be finally subdued, while angels
are only employed in ministering to his people.

<span id="xx.v-p9"></span>Who, after duly considering all these things,
can possibly come to any other conclusion than that the Messiah is a
divine person as well as human? Angels are commanded to worship him, his
throne is eternal, he created this world, and all his enemies shall
finally be made his footstool. That he is sometimes spoken of as having
a delegated power, as in <span id="xx.v-p9.1"></span>[Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002)<span id="xx.v-p9.1"></span>, “by
whom he (God) made the world,” and sometimes as acting independently, as
in <span id="xx.v-p9.2"></span>[Heb
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010)<span id="xx.v-p9.2"></span>,
“Thou, Lord, hast founded the earth;” all this only proves, that as he
is inferior to the Father in his mediatorial office, so he is one with
the Father as his only­begotten Son. Creation is what God claims as
peculiarly his own work; and were not the Son one in essence with the
Father, creation could not have been ascribed to him.

<span id="xx.vi"></span>

<span id="xx.vi-p1"></span>APPENDIX F

<span id="xx.vi-p2"></span>**Chapter 2:1.** *Lest at any time we should
let them slip.* Much has been written as to the meaning of the verb here
used. It is said by *Schleusner* that it signifies two things, “to flow
through,” as waters through a sieve or a leaky vessel, and “to flow by,”
as a river. It is used mostly in the latter sense. *Chrysostom* and
others, both ancient and modern, give it the sense of falling away or
perishing; but, according to *Stuart,* there is no instance either in
Scripture or the classics which countenances such a meaning. As it was
often the case, so here, the fathers gave what they conceived to be the
general sense, without attending to the precise meaning of the word
used; and thus their propositions are often very loose. Besides, most of
them were wholly ignorant of the language of the Old Testament.

<span id="xx.vi-p3"></span>To flow by, in the sense of escaping, is its
meaning in classical authors; and *Stuart* says that all the examples
commonly referred to apply only to *things,* and not to *persons.* The
word only occurs here in the New Testament, and once in the *Sept.;* and
there also it refers to a person, and is clearly used *transitively.*
The passage is <span id="xx.vi-p3.1"></span>[Pr
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021)<span id="xx.vi-p3.1"></span>, “O
son, pass not by (or disregard not, μὴ παραῤῥυὢς, flow not by,) but keep
(or retain, τήρησον) my counsel and thought.” The form of the sentence
is different in Hebrew, but the idea is here preserved, “My son, let
them not depart from thine eyes; keep (retain) sound wisdom and
discretion.” Not to suffer them to depart from the eyes, is the same as
not to pass them by or disregard them. There is no other idea compatible
with the context; and it is what exactly suits this passage. Then the
sentence would be, “Lest we should at any time disregard (or neglect)
them.”

<span id="xx.vi-p4"></span>It is justly observed by *Stuart,* that
everything in the whole passage is in favor of this meaning: it is the
opposite of “taking heed;” and it is often the case in Scripture that
the negative idea is stated as well as the positive, and *vice versa.*
Besides, in <span id="xx.vi-p4.1"></span>[Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003)<span id="xx.vi-p4.1"></span> the
same idea is presented to us on the same subject, “If we *neglect,*”
*etc.* Indeed, to disregard or neglect may be deemed as the
*consequence* of not taking heed or attending to a thing. Inattention to
truth is followed by the neglect of what it teaches and inculcates.
Unless we earnestly attend to what we hear, we shall inevitably neglect
what is required. There may be some attention without performance; but
there can be no performance without attention.

<span id="xx.vii"></span>

<span id="xx.vii-p1"></span>APPENDIX G

<span id="xx.vii-p2"></span>**Chapter 2:7** *Thou madest him, etc* The
reference is to <span id="xx.vii-p2.1"></span>[Ps
8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001)<span id="xx.vii-p2.1"></span>,
and has been variously explained. There are especially three opinions on
the subject. Some, like *Calvin* and *Doddridge,* consider that the case
of “man,” as described in the Psalm, is *alluded* to, or accommodated to
Christ. Others, like *Grotius,* hold that “man,” in the Psalm, is to be
understood historically and mystically. The third party, as most of the
Fathers, as well as some later divines, such as *Beza,* Dr. *Owen.,* and
*Stuart,* maintain that the Psalm is strictly prophetic. What makes it
difficult to regard it in this light is the exclamation, “What is man?”
and also the dominion over the brute creation, which is the only thing
mentioned in the Psalm as constituting the glory and honor of man.

<span id="xx.vii-p3"></span>All critics refer on this subject to the
grant given to Adam in <span id="xx.vii-p3.1"></span>[Ge
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028)<span id="xx.vii-p3.1"></span>.
But this grant, forfeited no doubt by Adam’s sin and fall, was
afterwards renewed to Noah and his sons, when they came out of the ark,
and was even enlarged, as the permission to eat animal food was given
them. <span id="xx.vii-p3.2"></span>[Ge
9:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001)<span id="xx.vii-p3.2"></span>.
It was this grant no doubt the Psalmist had in view. Noah and his sons
were men of faith; Noah is distinctly said to have been a righteous man.
It was to them as bearing this character that the grant was made. What
Adam forfeited was restored to those restored to God’s favor, that is,
the dominion over the brute creation and the inheritance of this lower
world. But as Canaan was afterwards to the Israelites a type of heaven,
and also a pledge to those who were Israelites indeed, so might be
regarded the possession of the earth granted to Noah and his sons,
though dominion in which “glory and honor” consisted, is what is
expressly mentioned in the Psalm; and dominion is the special subject
handled by the Apostle, <span id="xx.vii-p3.3"></span>[Heb
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005)<span id="xx.vii-p3.3"></span>.

<span id="xx.vii-p4"></span>Though man, as to his nature, is inferior to
the angels, yet in that nature God has granted him a dominion never
granted to angels. The power over every living thing in the world was
bestowed, not on angels, but on man, according to the testimony of the
Old Testament; so that the power ascribed by the Jews to angels was not
warranted by their own Scriptures. This fact seems to have been referred
to as an introduction to what the Apostle was proceeding to say
respecting Christ, and as an evidence that his human nature, though in
itself inferior to that of angels, did not detract from his superiority;
as though he had said, “It is no objection that he became man, for even
to man, not to angels, has been granted the dominion of the world.”

<span id="xx.vii-p5"></span>Then the Apostle extends the idea, and
refers to Christ as one who was to make good the grant made. The
dominion promised to man, especially what that dominion was a pledge of,
was not attained by man; but Christ, who has assumed his nature, and in
this respect became lower than the angels, will yet attain it for him.
It is through Christ indeed that we obtain a right to the things of this
world as well as to the things of the next world. God promises both to
his people; but in Christ only are his promises, yea and amen. The
promise made to man as a believer, both as to this world and the next,
is as it were made good only through Christ, who assumed his nature for
this very purpose.

<span id="xx.vii-p6"></span>By taking this view we avoid the necessity
of making that prophetic which has no appearance of being so, or of
supposing that the Psalm is referred to by way of accommodation. The
fact respecting man restored to God’s favor is stated, and the Apostle
teaches us that the dominion granted to him can only be realized through
Christ, who has already attained that dominion in his own person, and
will eventually confer it on all his people.

<span id="xx.viii"></span>

<span id="xx.viii-p1"></span>APPENDIX H

<span id="xx.viii-p2"></span>**Chapter 2:9.** *That he by the grace of
God, etc* How to connect the different parts of this verse has been a
difficulty which critics have in various ways attempted to remove. There
is hardly a sense in our version. We must either regard a transposition
in the words, or, like *Stuart,* give the meaning of *when* to ὅπως,
“when by the grace of God he had tasted death for all.” But this is an
unnatural meaning, and therefore not satisfactory. *Doddrid*g*e*
supposes a transposition, and gives this version, —

<span id="xx.viii-p3"></span>“But we see Jesus, who was made a little
lower than the angels for the suffering of death, that by the grace of
God he might taste death for every man, crowned with glory and honor.”

<span id="xx.viii-p4"></span>*Macknight* more properly connects “the
suffering of death” with “crowned with glory and honor,” while he makes
a similar transposition. *Bloomfield* considers that there is an
ellipsis in the last clause, and gives this rendering, —

<span id="xx.viii-p5"></span>“But him, who was made a little lower than
the angels, even Jesus, we behold, on account of having suffered death,
crowned with glory and honor, which suffering he bore, in order that by
the grace of God he might taste of death for every man.”

<span id="xx.viii-p6"></span>This borders on tautology, and cannot be
admitted. That the transposition made by *Doddridge* and *Macknight*
gives the real meaning, admits hardly of a doubt; and such a version
would be the most suitable in our language. But how to account for the
arrangement in the Apostle’s words seems to be this, it is a
construction according to the system of Hebrew parallelism; the first
and the last clause are connected, and the second and the third. Let the
verse be arranged in lines, and this will become quite evident, —

<span id="xx.viii-p7"></span>“But him, who was made a little lower than
angels, — We behold, *even* Jesus, for the suffering of death, Crowned
with glory and honor, — That by God’s grace he might for all taste
death.”

<span id="xx.viii-p8"></span>The meaning is clearly this, — that he was
made lower than angels in order to die for all, and that on account of
his atoning death he was crowned with glory and honor; which perfectly
accords with what the Apostle teaches us in <span
id="xx.viii-p8.1"></span>[Php
2:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008)<span id="xx.viii-p8.1"></span>.
See a similar arrangement in <span id="xx.viii-p8.2"></span>[Mt
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006)<span id="xx.viii-p8.2"></span>,
and <span id="xx.viii-p8.3"></span>[1Co
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011)<span id="xx.viii-p8.3"></span>.

<span id="xx.ix"></span>

<span id="xx.ix-p1"></span>APPENDIX I

<span id="xx.ix-p2"></span>**Chapter 2:14** *The power of death, etc*
This is rendered by *Stuart* “deadly power.” The genitive after χράτος;
is no doubt in several instances rendered adjectively, as “the power of
his glory,” in <span id="xx.ix-p2.1"></span>[Col
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011)<span id="xx.ix-p2.1"></span>,
“his glorious power;” and “the power of his might,” in <span
id="xx.ix-p2.2"></span>[Eph 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010)<span
id="xx.ix-p2.2"></span>, may be rendered “His mighty power.” But there
is here an antithesis which ought to be preserved, — the death of Christ
and the death over which Satan is said to have power. Christ by his
death deprived Satan of his power to cause death.

<span id="xx.ix-p3"></span>To “destroy” does not suitably express what
is meant by the verb here used. It means to render void, useless,
inefficacious, and hence to overcome, to subdue. When applied to the
Law, it means to render void or to abolish: but when it refers to a
person, as here, or to a hostile power, as in <span
id="xx.ix-p3.1"></span>[1Co 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024)<span
id="xx.ix-p3.1"></span>, it means to subjugate, to put down, or to
overcome. So here, the rendering most suitable would be, “that by death
he might overcome (or subdue) him who had the power of death,” that is,
the power of causing eternal ruin; for death here must mean the second
death. And hence the Rabbinical notion about the angel of death, that
is, of temporal death, has no connection with this passage.

<span id="xx.ix-p4"></span>There is here evidently an allusion to <span
id="xx.ix-p4.1"></span>[Ge 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#013)<span
id="xx.ix-p4.1"></span>. The originator of death is Satan, both as to
the soul and the body; and hence our Savior calls him a murderer. To
subdue this murderer was to remove the sin which he introduced, by means
of which he brought in death; and this removal of sin was effected by
death, so that the remedy for sin was the same with the effect which sin
produced.

<span id="xx.x"></span>

<span id="xx.x-p1"></span>APPENDIX K

<span id="xx.x-p2"></span>**Chapter 2:16** *For verily he took not, etc*
The words may be rendered, “For verily he lays not hold on angels, but
on the seed of Abraham does he lay hold.” Both early and later divines
have supposed “nature” to be understood; but some moderns, following
*Cameron* of an earlier age, regard the verb in the sense of bringing
aid or help. So *Stuart* and *Bloomfield.* The first renders the verse
thus, —

<span id="xx.x-p3"></span>“Besides, he doth not at all help the angels,
but he helpeth the seed of Abraham.”

<span id="xx.x-p4"></span>The present, the historical present, is used
for the past; or if we render οὐ γὰρ δήπου “for nowhere,” the reference
is to Scripture; nowhere in Scripture is such a thing recorded.

<span id="xx.x-p5"></span>But to “take hold on” is sufficiently plain
and very expressive. Christ took hold on Peter when he was sinking,
(<span id="xx.x-p5.1"></span>[Mt
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#031)<span id="xx.x-p5.1"></span>:) it
is the same verb. Our Savior took not hold on the angels when sinking
into ruin, but he did take hold on the seed of Abraham to save them from
perdition. The connection seems to be with the preceding verses;
therefore γὰρ ought to be rendered “for” and not “besides,” as by
*Stuart,* nor “moreover,” as by *Macknight.* A reason is given why
Christ became partaker of flesh and blood; and the reason was, because
he did not come to deliver angels but the seed of Abraham; that is, his
spiritual, not his natural seed, for he speaks throughout of God’s sons
and God’s children. See <span id="xx.x-p5.2"></span>[John
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013)<span id="xx.x-p5.2"></span>, where
the born of God are represented to be those to whom Christ grants the
privilege of children.

<span id="xx.xi"></span>

<span id="xx.xi-p1"></span>APPENDIX L

<span id="xx.xi-p2"></span>**Chapter 3:4** *He that built, etc.* This
verse has been considered as difficult with respect to the connection it
has with the argument of the Apostle. *Stuart* states thus the
difficulty, — “Moses as the *delegate* of God was the founder of the
Jewish institution, and Christ is merely declared to be only a
*delegated founder,* then in what way does the writer make out the
superiority of Christ to Moses. Both were delegates of the same God, and
both the founders of a new and divine dispensation. If Christ, then, is
not here asserted to be founder in some other character than that of a
*delegate,* I am unable to perceive any force in the writer’s argument.”
Hence the Professor comes to the conclusion, that Christ is meant by the
Apostle when he says, “He who built (or formed) all things is God,”
conceiving that the argument is otherwise inconclusive.

<span id="xx.xi-p3"></span>Now, the mistake of the Professor is this,
that he makes delegation to be the comparison and not the *character* of
the delegation. That Christ’s power was delegated is quite evident from
this passage: Christ is said to have been “appointed” in <span
id="xx.xi-p3.1"></span>[Heb 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002)<span
id="xx.xi-p3.1"></span>, and is said to be “faithful,” which implies
that he had an office delegated to him. Then the delegation is
undeniable; and what the Apostle evidently dwells upon is the
superiority of the delegated power: Moses was faithful as a servant in
God’s house; the people of Israel were previously Gods adopted people;
but Christ has power, a delegated power, to make as it were a new
people; he builds his own house. Moses was a part of the house in which
he served; but as Christ builds his own house, he is worthy of more
glory than Moses. These are the comparisons made by the Apostle.

<span id="xx.xi-p4"></span>Then this verse is introduced, and that for
two reasons, — first, to shew that God built the house in which Moses
served; and secondly, to intimate the divine power of Christ, as none
but God builds all things. Moses’ house is called God’s house in <span
id="xx.xi-p4.1"></span>[Heb 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002)<span
id="xx.xi-p4.1"></span>; and Christ’s house is called his own in <span
id="xx.xi-p4.2"></span>[Heb 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005)<span
id="xx.xi-p4.2"></span>. Hence the obvious inference is, that he is one
with God, as God only builds all things, though in his Mediatorial
character he acts as God’s Apostle and high priest. The same kind of
representation we find in <span id="xx.xi-p4.3"></span>[Heb.
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010)<span id="xx.xi-p4.3"></span>: it
is said that by him God made the world; and afterwards that the Son is
the Creator, who had founded the earth, and whose work are the heavens.
Creative power, though exercised by Christ as a Mediator, must yet be a
divine power.

<span id="xx.xii"></span>

<span id="xx.xii-p1"></span>APPENDIX M

<span id="xx.xii-p2"></span>**Chapter 3:9.** *Tempted, etc.* To
understand this passage we must bear in mind the event referred to. The
same year in which the people of Israel came forth from Egypt, they were
distressed for water at Rephidim, (<span id="xx.xii-p2.1"></span>[Ex
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001)<span id="xx.xii-p2.1"></span>;)
and the place had two names given to it, Massah and Meribah, because the
people tempted God and chided with Moses. The Lord did not swear *then*
that they should not enter into the land of Canaan; but this was on the
following year, after the return of the spies. (<span
id="xx.xii-p2.2"></span>[Nu
14:20-38](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#020)<span
id="xx.xii-p2.2"></span>.) And God said then that they had tempted him
“ten times;” that is, during the short time since their deliverance from
Egypt. It was after *ten* temptations that God deprived them of the
promised land.

<span id="xx.xii-p3"></span>Bearing in mind these facts, we shall be
able to see the full force of the passage. The “provocation” or
contention, and “temptation” refer clearly to the latter instance, as
recorded in <span id="xx.xii-p3.1"></span>[Numbers
14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#000)<span id="xx.xii-p3.1"></span>,
because it was then that God swear that the people should not enter into
his rest. The people’s conduct was alike in both instances.

<span id="xx.xii-p4"></span>To connect “forty years” with “grieved” was
the work of the Punctuists, and this mistake the Apostle corrected; and
it is to be observed that he did not follow in this instance the
*Septuagint,* in which the words are arranged as divided by the
Masorites. Such a rendering as would correspond with the Hebrew is as
follows, — “Today when ye hear his voice,

<span id="xx.xii-p5"></span>**8.** Harden not your hearts as in the
provocation, In the day of temptation in the wilderness.

<span id="xx.xii-p6"></span>**9.** When your fathers tempted me, they
proved me And saw my works forty years:

<span id="xx.xii-p7"></span>**10** I was therefore offended with that
generation and said, Always do they go astray in heart, And they have
not known my ways;

<span id="xx.xii-p8"></span>**11.** So that I swear in my wrath, They
shall by no means enter into my rest.’”

<span id="xx.xii-p9"></span>The meaning of the ninth verse is, that when
the children of Israel tempted God, they proved him, *i.e.,* found out
by bitter experience how great his displeasure was, and saw his works or
his dealings with them for forty years. He retained them in the
wilderness during that period until the death of all who disbelieved his
word at the return of the spies; he gave them this proof of his
displeasure. “Therefore” in <span id="xx.xii-p9.1"></span>[Heb
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#011)<span id="xx.xii-p9.1"></span> is
connected with “tempted;” it was because they tempted him that he was
offended with them so as to swear that they should not enter into his
rest. There is evidently a <span id="xx.xii-p9.2"></span>ו left out in
Hebrew, found only in one MS.; but it is required by the future form of
the verb. To “go astray in heart” was to disbelieve God’s word, (see
<span id="xx.xii-p9.3"></span>[Heb
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012)<span id="xx.xii-p9.3"></span>,
and <span id="xx.xii-p9.4"></span>[Nu
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#011)<span id="xx.xii-p9.4"></span>;)
and not to have known Gods ways, was not to recognize his power, and
goodness, and faithfulness in their deliverance from Egypt. See <span
id="xx.xii-p9.5"></span>[Nu 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022)<span
id="xx.xii-p9.5"></span>. Not to know here does not mean what *Stuart*
says, not to approve, but not to comprehend or understand God’s ways, or
not to recognize them as his ways or doings.

<span id="xx.xii-p10"></span>The last line is in the form of an oath,
“If they shall enter,” etc.; but when in this defective form, the “if”
may be rendered as a strong negative, “by no means.” *Doddridge* has
“never,” and *Macknight* “not,” in which he has been followed by
*Stuart.*

<span id="xx.xiii"></span>

<span id="xx.xiii-p1"></span>APPENDIX N

<span id="xx.xiii-p2"></span>**Chapter 3:15** *While it is said, etc.*
No doubt the connection first referred to in the note is the most
suitable. This verse is as it were the heading of what follows; but to
put the sixteenth verse in an interrogatory form, as is done by
*Stuart,* seems not suitable to the passage. I would render the words
thus, —

<span id="xx.xiii-p3"></span>**15.** With regard to what is said,
“Today, when ye hear his

<span id="xx.xiii-p4"></span>**16.** voice, harden not your hearts as in
the provocation,” some indeed when they heard did provoke, but not all
who came

<span id="xx.xiii-p5"></span>**17.** out of Egypt under Moses: but with
whom was he offended for forty years? was it not with those who sinned,
whose

<span id="xx.xiii-p6"></span>**18.** carcasses fell in the wilderness?
And to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, but
to those who did not believe?

<span id="xx.xiii-p7"></span>The “provocation” is the subject; who
offered it are then mentioned; and afterwards the cause of it, the want
of faith.

<span id="xx.xiv"></span>

<span id="xx.xiv-p1"></span>APPENDIX O

<span id="xx.xiv-p2"></span>**Chapter 4:2** *For unto us* *was the
Gospel preached, etc.* Literally it is, “For we have been evangelized.”
*Doddridge* has, “For we are made partakers of the good tidings;”
*Macknight,* “For we also have received the good tidings;” and *Stuart,*
“For to us also blessings are proclaimed.” Perhaps the most literal
version would be, “For we also have had good tidings.” The same form of
words occurs again in <span id="xx.xiv-p2.1"></span>[Heb
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#006)<span id="xx.xiv-p2.1"></span>,
“And they to whom it was first preached,” etc.; rather, “And they who
had first good tidings,” etc. The good tidings were evidently the
promise of rest.

<span id="xx.xiv-p3"></span>“The word preached” is literally “the word
of hearing;” that is, the word heard, a noun being put for a participle,
a common thing in Hebrew.

<span id="xx.xiv-p4"></span>Though there are several MSS. and the Greek
fathers in favor of “mixed” being in the accusative case, agreeing with
“them,” “who united not by faith with those who heard,” *i.e.,* obeyed;
yet the *Vulgate* and the *Syriac* countenance our present reading,
which has been adopted by *Erasmus, Beza,* Dr. *Owen,* and most modern
divines, as being most suitable to the passage.

<span id="xx.xiv-p5"></span>Our version is followed by *Doddridge* and
*Macknight.* The version of *Stuart* is the same with that of *Calvin,*
“being not connected with faith in those who heard it.” The *Syriac*
seems the most literal, “being not mingled with faith by them who heard
it.” They had not the ingredient of faith to mix up as it were with it.
Instead of receiving the promise, they refused and rejected it, as
though it were an unwholesome and disagreeable draught. The word is used
in <span id="xx.xiv-p5.1"></span>[2 Macc.
15:39](../../../bib/apo/ma2015.htm#039)<span id="xx.xiv-p5.1"></span>,
of wine *mingled* with water.

<span id="xx.xv"></span>

<span id="xx.xv-p1"></span>APPENDIX P

<span id="xx.xv-p2"></span>**Chapter 4:12.** *For the word of God, etc*.
Some, as *Stuart* and *Bloomfield,* view “the word” here as minatory,
being a threatening to the unbelievers before mentioned. Though it may
be so viewed, yet it seems not to be right to translate λόγος;
“threatening,” as done by *Stuart.*

<span id="xx.xvi"></span>

<span id="xx.xvi-p1"></span>APPENDIX Q

<span id="xx.xvi-p2"></span>“Quick” or living, and “powerful” or
efficacious, are regarded by many as meaning nearly the same thing; but
“living” designates what is valid, what continues in force, as opposed
to what is dead and no longer existing; and “efficacious” refers to the
effect, capable of producing the effect designed. Exclusion from rest as
to unbelievers was still living, still in force, abiding the same
without any change. See <span id="xx.xvi-p2.1"></span>[1 Pet.
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023),
[25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#025)<span id="xx.xvi-p2.1"></span>. It
was also in full power so as effectually to exclude from rest all who
did not believe. And then to prevent every evasion, so that no one might
think a mere profession sufficient, or rather to guard against the
incipient seduction of sin, he compares this “word” to a sword which can
dissect the whole well­compacted frame of man, so that even the very
marrow may be discovered; and then passing from this simile, he says
that this “word” is capable of judging the thoughts and purposes of the
heart. And in order to identify as it were this “word” with God himself;
he immediately refers to God’s omniscience. The design of the Apostle
seems to have been to guard the Hebrews against the deceitfulness of
sin; so that they might not give heed to any of its hidden suggestions.

<span id="xx.xvi-p3"></span>*Stuart* makes the transition from the
“word” to God at the end of the twelfth verse, and renders the clause
thus, “He also judgeth the thoughts and purposes of the heart.” But this
clause may more properly be viewed as explanatory of what is said of the
two-edged sword.

<span id="xx.xvii"></span>

<span id="xx.xvii-p1"></span>APPENDIX R

<span id="xx.xvii-p2"></span>**Chapter 4:12.** *Two­edged sword, etc*
Whether the penetrating, or convincing, or killing power of the “word”
is set forth by the metaphor of the “sword,” has been controverted.
*Beza* and *Scott,* as well as *Calvin,* regard its convincing *and*
killing power as intended. “It enters,” says *Beta,* “into the inmost
recesses of the soul, so that it indicts on the perverse a deadly wound,
and by killing the old man quickens into life the elect.” *Stuart* views
its killing power as alone intended: “The sense is,” he observes, “that
the divine commination is of *most deadly* punitive efficacy.”

<span id="xx.xvii-p3"></span>Now, if the whole passage be duly
considered in connection with what is gone before, there will appear a
sufficient reason to conclude, that the metaphor of “the sword “is only
intended to shew that the “word” reaches to all the inward workings of
the soul, that it extends to the motives and the most hidden thoughts
and purposes of the heart. The last clause in the 12th verse clearly
explains what is meant by the “sword;” and this is further confirmed by
the following verse, where it is said that all things are naked and open
to God, of whose word he speaks, and with whom we have to do. All this
seems to concur with the purpose for which the words were introduced,
that is, to warn the Hebrews of the danger of listening to the seductive
and deceiving power of sin.

<span id="xx.xvii-p4"></span>As to the 13th verse, *Bloomfield* suggests
a transposition which would render the transition from God’s word to God
himself much more easy, “Moreover there exists no creature that is not
manifest in the sight of him with whom we have to do; but all things are
naked and exposed to his eyes.” But the construction here is similar to
what we have noticed in two previous instances, <span
id="xx.xvii-p4.1"></span>[Heb. 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#018)<span id="xx.xvii-p4.1"></span>;
the first and the last clause are connected, and the two middle clauses.

<span id="xx.xvii-p5"></span>The last sentence is rendered by *Grotius,*
“of whom is our word, *i.e.,* of whom we speak; by *Beza,* “with whom we
have to do; by *Doddridge, Macknig*h*t,* and *Stuart,* “to whom we must
give an account.” Wherever λόγος signifies “account,” the verb “to
render,” or a similar verb is connected with it. There are two instances
in the *Sept.* where it stands alone with a pronoun in the dative case
as here, and it means *business, affair,* or *concern:* see <span
id="xx.xvii-p5.1"></span>[Jud
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#028)<span id="xx.xvii-p5.1"></span>,
and <span id="xx.xvii-p5.2"></span>[2Ki
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#005)<span id="xx.xvii-p5.2"></span>. In
the last passage it is connected also, as here, with the preposition
πρὸς. There can therefore be no doubt but that our version is the right
one, “with whom we have to do,” or literally, “with whom *there is* to
us a concern.” There is no <span id="xx.xvii-p5.3"></span>*usus
loquendi,* as pleaded by some, in favor of the other meaning.

<span id="xx.xviii"></span>

<span id="xx.xviii-p1"></span>APPENDIX S

<span id="xx.xviii-p2"></span>**Chapter 6:1** *Therefore leaving, etc*
Authors differ as to the character of this passage, whether it be
hortatory or didactic, that is, whether the Apostle, putting himself as
it were with them, exhorts them to advance in knowledge, or, discharging
the office of a teacher, he intimates the course which he means to
pursue. *Stuart* and some others, as well as *Calvin,* take the first
view, as though the Apostle had said, “As the perfect or grown up are
alone capable of receiving strong food, it behooves us to quit the state
of childhood and to advance into the state of manhood, so as to attain
perfect knowledge.” It is said that this view comports better with what
follows, “for it is impossible,” etc.

<span id="xx.xviii-p3"></span>But there are especially two things in the
passage which militate against this view, first, “not laying the
foundation,” etc. which refers evidently to teaching; and secondly, the
third verse, which also refers to teaching.

<span id="xx.xviii-p4"></span>It is usual with the Apostle to speak of
himself in the plural number: see, for instance, the 9th verse.
“Therefore” is a general inference from what he had been saying, and not
from a particular clause, as though he had said, “Such being the case
with you, let me now therefore, in order to draw you onward, leave the
first principles, and proceed to state things which are suitable to
advanced Christians: it is not my purpose now to preach repentance and
faith in which you have been already taught, and to do this is
unavailing as to those who have fallen away; ‘for it is impossible,’”
etc. His object was not to convert them to the faith, but to confirm and
advance them in it.

<span id="xx.xviii-p5"></span>Or the whole argument may be more fully
stated thus, — “What I design now to do is not to call you to repentance
and faith, to require you to be baptized that you might receive the
miraculous gift of the Holy Ghost, and to teach you the doctrine of the
resurrection as confirmed by our Savior’s resurrection, and of the day
of judgment, when a sentence shall be pronounced on the just and unjust
which shall never be reversed; for all these things have been long known
to you, and you have made a long profession of them: there is therefore
no need of taking such a course, nor is it of any benefit, for if you
fall away, it is impossible to restore you again to repentance.” But
instead of making the case personal to them, he states it generally. He
thus most powerfully stimulated them to make advances in the knowledge
of divine truths; for not to advance is to retrograde, and to retrograde
is the direct way to apostasy.

<span id="xx.xix"></span>

<span id="xx.xix-p1"></span>APPENDIX T

<span id="xx.xix-p2"></span>**Chapter 6:5.** *And the powers of the
world to come.* The *five* things mentioned here have been variously
explained.

<span id="xx.xix-p3"></span>**1** *Enlightened,* — baptized, say most of
the fathers, and some moderns too, but without any countenance from the
use of the word in Scripture, either in the New Testament or in the
*Sept.* It means to emit light, to bring to light, to enlighten, and
hence to instruct, to teach. It is often used in the *Sept.* for a word
that means to teach in Hebrew. The taught, the instructed in the duty
and necessity of repentance and in Christian truth generally, were no
doubt “the enlightened.” This is the meaning given to it by *Crotius,
Beza, Dr* *Owen, Doddridge, Scott, Stuart, etc.*

<span id="xx.xix-p4"></span>**2** *The heavenly* gift, — faith — Christ
— the Holy Spirit — pardon of sins — peace of conscience — eternal life:
all these have been stated, but the first, “faith towards God,”
mentioned in the first verse, is no doubt what is meant.

<span id="xx.xix-p5"></span>**3.** *Partakers of the Holy Ghost;* that
is, in his miraculous powers, as understood by most; it is what is
evidently intimated by “baptisms and laying on of hands” in the second
verse.

<span id="xx.xix-p6"></span>**4** *The good word of God,* — the Gospel —
the Gospel covenant — the promises of the Gospel — the heavenly
inheritance: such have been the explanations given. There are but two
places where the phrase “the good word” occurs, and that is in <span
id="xx.xix-p6.1"></span>[Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010)<span id="xx.xix-p6.1"></span>,
and in <span id="xx.xix-p6.2"></span>[Jer
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014)<span id="xx.xix-p6.2"></span>;
and there it means the promise of restoration given to the Jews, and
here it clearly means the promise of the resurrection mentioned in the
second verse.

<span id="xx.xix-p7"></span>**5.** *The powers of the world to come*;
that is, miraculous powers, say most; but αἰω&lt;n oj me&gt;λλων, “the
world to come,” says *Schleusner* never means in the New Testament the
time of the Gospel, but the future world. See <span
id="xx.xix-p7.1"></span>[Mt 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#032)<span
id="xx.xix-p7.1"></span>; <span id="xx.xix-p7.2"></span>[Lu
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#030)<span id="xx.xix-p7.2"></span>;
<span id="xx.xix-p7.3"></span>[Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021)<span id="xx.xix-p7.3"></span>. He
therefore explains the clause thus, “The power and efficacy of the
doctrine respecting the future felicity of Christians in heaven.” It
would have comported more with the “eternal judgment” in these converse,
had he said, “respecting the future state both of the saved and of the
lost in the next world;” for eternal judgment refers to both.

<span id="xx.xix-p8"></span>To “taste,” according to the usage of
Scripture, is to know, to partake of, to experience, to possess, to
enjoy. It does not mean here, as some have thought, slightly to touch a
thing, or to sip it, but to know, to know experimentally, to feel, or to
enjoy.

<span id="xx.xix-p9"></span>Thus we see that there is a complete
correspondence between the particulars mentioned here and the things
stated in verses 1 and 2.

<span id="xx.xx"></span>

<span id="xx.xx-p1"></span>APPENDIX U

<span id="xx.xx-p2"></span>**Chapter 6: 4­9.** On the subject handled in
these verses, *Stuart* asks and answers a question thus, “Does the whole
paragraph pertain to real Christians, or to those who are such only by
profession? To the former beyond all reasonable doubt.” The question is
not suitable, for the Apostle only speaks of those who had enjoyed
certain privileges, and as to whether they were real or merely
professing Christians, he does not treat of. Paul addressed the
Corinthians as “the Church of God;” and it might in the same way be
asked, “Did he address them as real Christians, or as those who were
only such by profession t” and it might be answered, “Doubtless as real
Christians.” And yet we find that he says, “Examine yourselves, whether
ye be in the faith.” What is spoken of here is the *enjoyment* of
certain privileges and the danger of not making a right use of them, and
even the awful doom of those who disregarded them and turned away from
the truth.

<span id="xx.xx-p3"></span>Our author indeed fully admits the doctrine
of the perseverance of the saints; but a question of this kind, not
relevant to the subject, tends only to create embarrassment. He indeed
afterwards somewhat modifies it by saying, that “God treats Christians
as free agents and rational beings, and guards them against defection,
not by mere *physical* force, but by *moral* means adapted to their
nature as free and rational agents.” No doubt God thus acts according to
the whole current of Scripture; but this in no way contravenes the
truth, clearly taught in many passages, that his elect people, real
Christians, shall never perish.

<span id="xx.xxi"></span>

<span id="xx.xxi-p1"></span>APPENDIX X

<span id="xx.xxi-p2"></span>**Chapter 6:10.** *And labor of love, etc*
Though *Griesbach* and others have excluded τοῦ χόπου, “labor,” from the
text, yet *Bloomfield* thinks that there are sufficient reasons for
retaining the words. The greatest number of MSS. contain them, and they
seem necessary to render the passage complete, though the meaning
without them would be the same. There is here an instance of an
arrangement similar to what is found often in the Prophets, as will be
seen by putting the verse in lines, —

<span id="xx.xxi-p3"></span>“For not unrighteous is God, To forget your
work, And the labor of that love Which ye have shewed to his name,
Having ministered and ministering to the saints.”

<span id="xx.xxi-p4"></span>Excluding the first line, we see that the
first and last are connected, and the two middle lines. Their “work” was
to minister to the saints; and in addition to this there was “the labor
of that love” which they manifested towards God. He would not forget
their work in aiding the saints, nor the love which they had shewn
towards his name by an open profession of it, and activity and zeal in
God’s service. *Grotius* says that “the labor of love” was in behalf of
the Christian faith.

<span id="xx.xxi-p5"></span>*Stuart* says that “work” was the outward
act, and that “love” was the principle from which it emanated. Examples
of this kind no doubt occur often in Scripture, the not being first
stated, and then the inward principle or motive; but if “labor” be
retained, this view cannot be maintained.

<span id="xx.xxii"></span>

<span id="xx.xxii-p1"></span>APPENDIX Y

<span id="xx.xxii-p2"></span>**Chapter 6:11.** *To the full assurance,
etc.* The preposition πρὸς, “to,” may be rendered “with regard to, in
respect of” If this meaning be given to it, then the diligence required
was with reference to the full assurance of hope: they were to exercise
diligence in order that they might enjoy the assurance of hope to the
end. But if the preposition be rendered “for the sake of,” as by
*Stuart,* then the meaning is, that they were to exercise the same
diligence as they had already exhibited in the work and labor of love,
for the purpose of attaining the full assurance of hope.

<span id="xx.xxii-p3"></span>Now *Calvin* takes the first meaning; he
considers that the Apostle now refers to the full assurance of hope or
of faith as he regards it, as he had before spoken of the works of
benevolence. What follows seems to favor this view, for the Apostle
proceeds to speak of faith and patience as exemplified by the fathers,
especially by Abraham.

<span id="xx.xxii-p4"></span>Some, as *Beza,* connect “to the end” with
“shewing the same diligence,” but it is more suitable to connect them
with “the assurance of hope,” as it is done by most.

<span id="xx.xxii-p5"></span>The remarks of *Scott* on the difference of
“the assurance of hope,” of “the understanding,” and of “faith,” are so
clear and discriminating that they shall be added, —

<span id="xx.xxii-p6"></span>“He who so understands the Gospel as to
perceive the relation of each part to all the rest, and its use as a
part of some great design, in something of the same manner that a
skillful anatomist understands the use and office of every part of the
human body, in relation to the whole, has *the full assurance of
understanding;* and those things willful appear inconsistent, useless,
or superfluous to others, he perceives essentially necessary to the
system or the great design. The man who is fully convinced that this
consistent and harmonious though complicated design is the work and
revelation of God, and has no doubt the things testified are true, that
the promises and threatenings will be fulfilled, and that Christ will
certainly save all true believers, has *the full assurance of faith,*
though he may through misapprehension, or temptation, or other causes,
doubt of his own personal interest in this salvation. But he, who beyond
doubt or hesitation is assured that he himself is a true believer,
interested in all the precious promises, sealed by the sanctifying
Spirit, and ‘a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed,’ has *the
full assurance of hope.*”

<span id="xx.xxiii"></span>

<span id="xx.xxiii-p1"></span>APPENDIX Z

<span id="xx.xxiii-p2"></span>**Chapter 7**<span
id="xx.xxiii-p2.1"></span>:**14** *For under it the people received the
Law, etc* These words are variously explained. The preposition ἐπὶ often
means “for,” or “on the account of,” as ἐπ᾿ ἐλπίδι, “for the hope,”
(<span id="xx.xxiii-p2.2"></span>[Ac
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006)<span id="xx.xxiii-p2.2"></span>;)
and so *Macknight* renders it here “on account of it the people received
the Law.” It is not true that the people were under the priesthood when
they were subjected to the Law; for the Law was given before the
Levitical priesthood was established: it was after the tabernacle was
made and set up that Aaron and his sons were consecrated priests. See
<span id="xx.xxiii-p2.3"></span>[Ex
40:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#012)<span
id="xx.xxiii-p2.3"></span>

<span id="xx.xxiii-p3"></span>*Stuart* gives another rendering, “For the
Law was given to the people in connection with this,” or “on this
condition,” as he explains himself in a note. And he observes, “The
meaning is, that the Levitical priesthood and the Mosaic Law are closely
and inseparably linked together.”

<span id="xx.xxiii-p4"></span>As the Apostle speaks afterwards of the
change of the Law, that is, respecting the priesthood, it is more
consistent to regard the same law as intended here, “though the people
had received a law respecting it,” that is, the priesthood. This is
parenthetically put in for two reasons, — to anticipate an objection on
the ground of a divine appointment, and to introduce the subject for the
purpose of shewing that it was an appointment intended to be changed.

<span id="xx.xxiv"></span>

<span id="xx.xxiv-p1"></span>APPENDIX A 2

<span id="xx.xxiv-p2"></span>**Chapter 7:11­17.** This passage may be
thus rendered, —

<span id="xx.xxiv-p3"></span>**11.** “Now if indeed perfection were by
the Levitical priesthood, (though the people had received a law
respecting it,) what need was there still that another priest should
rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not to be named after the order

<span id="xx.xxiv-p4"></span>**12**. of Aaron? The priesthood then being
changed, there is of

<span id="xx.xxiv-p5"></span>**13.** necessity a change also of the law;
for he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from whom
no one

<span id="xx.xxiv-p6"></span>**14.** attended at the altar. It is indeed
evident that our Lord sprang from Judah, of which tribe Moses said
nothing

<span id="xx.xxiv-p7"></span>**15.** respecting the priesthood. And this
is still more manifest, since according to the likeness of Melchisedec
rises another

<span id="xx.xxiv-p8"></span>**16.** priest; who is made, not according
to the law of carnal

<span id="xx.xxiv-p9"></span>**17.** precept, but according to the power
of perpetual life; for he testifies, ‘Thou art a priest for ever,
according to the order of Melchisedec.’”

<span id="xx.xxiv-p10"></span>“The law of carnal precept” is the rule
that refers to the present life, life in the flesh, which is frail and
uncertain; and contrasted with it is “perpetual life, which belongs to
Christ as a priest, according to the quotation which follows. The
meaning is, that Christ was not made a priest according to that law
which regulates things belonging to dying men, (see <span
id="xx.xxiv-p10.1"></span>[Heb
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#023)<span id="xx.xxiv-p10.1"></span>,)
but in accordance with what was suitable to one endued with permanent
life or existence.

<span id="xx.xxiv-p11"></span>The argument of the whole passage seems to
be as follows, — There is no perfection in the Levitical priesthood, for
another priest has been appointed. This being the case, the law
respecting the priesthood must necessarily be changed; and that it is
changed is proved by two things, — by the fact that Christ did not
spring from the tribe of Levi, and by the prophetic announcement that he
was to be a priest according to the order of Melchisedec, and
consequently a perpetual priest, and not like the sons of Aaron, who
were priests in succession, being all subject to death.

<span id="xx.xxv"></span>

<span id="xx.xxv-p1"></span>APPENDIX B 2

<span id="xx.xxv-p2"></span>**Chapter 7:19.** *But the bringing in, etc.
Theophylact, Luther, Capellus,* and others have rendered this noun as in
the same predicament with “disannulling” or abrogation in the former
verse, —

<span id="xx.xxv-p3"></span>**18.** “There is therefore an abrogation of
the preceding commandment, on account of its weakness and uselessness,
(for

<span id="xx.xxv-p4"></span>**19.** the law perfected nothing,) and an
introduction of a better hope, through which we draw nigh to God.”

<span id="xx.xxv-p5"></span>This passage forms an inference or a
conclusion from what has been said. The “commandment” abrogated was
respecting the Levitical priesthood. Its “weakness” was, that it could
not really atone for sin; and its uselessness, that it could not make
men holy or confer life. The same thing is expressed in the words
included in the parenthesis. But what has been said does not only prove
that the Levitical priesthood is abolished, but also that there is
brought in or introduced a better hope; which means that a better thing
than the Levitical priesthood, which was an object of hope to the
ancient saints, is introduced after that priesthood, and was expressly
mentioned by David in the Psalms many years after the Levitical
priesthood was established. This appears to be the genuine meaning of
the passage.

<span id="xx.xxv-p6"></span>Then the following verses come in very
suitably, as the “introduction” is mentioned here, —

<span id="xx.xxv-p7"></span>**20.** “And inasmuch as *it was* not
without an oath, (for they

<span id="xx.xxv-p8"></span>**21.** indeed were made priests without an
oath, but he with an oath, *made by* him who said to him, ‘The Lord hath
sworn and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, according

<span id="xx.xxv-p9"></span>**22**. to the order of Melchisedec,’) of a
covenant so much the

<span id="xx.xxv-p10"></span>**23.** better is Jesus the surety. They
are also many who are made priests, because they are not suffered by
death to continue; but he, because he abideth for ever, hath a
priesthood that passeth not to another, (or more literally, hath an
intransmissible priesthood.)”

<span id="xx.xxv-p11"></span>What was not “without an oath” was “the
introduction,” etc. There are here two additional things stated as
proving the superiority of Christ’s priesthood: the oath proved that he
was the surety of a better covenant; and his priesthood, unlike that of
Aaron, which passed from one to another, was intransmissible or
unsuccessive, as the word means, and not “unchangeable,” as in our
version.

<span id="xx.xxvi"></span>

<span id="xx.xxvi-p1"></span>APPENDIX C 2

<span id="xx.xxvi-p2"></span>**Chapter 7:27.** *Who needeth not daily,
etc* A difficulty has been raised as to this verse. It is said that
Christ did not, like the priests, offer up a daily sacrifice, first for
his own sins and then for the sins of the people, “for this he did once
when he offered up himself.” It seems hence, it is said, that he offered
a sacrifice for himself as well as for the people. In order to explain
this, it has been proposed to take in the following verse; and it has
been said that there is here an arrangement similar to what often occurs
in the Prophets; that is, when two things are stated, the last is first
referred to, and then the first. The two things here are the priest’s
own sins and those of the people. The Apostle is supposed to speak first
of what Christ did as to the sins of the people, and then that in the
following verse he shews that Christ had no sins of his own, for he
became or was made “a perfect priest,” and that “for ever,” being
sinless not only when he actually offered the great sacrifice, but also
sinless as our intercessor in heaven.

<span id="xx.xxvi-p3"></span>This is the explanation of Bishop *Jebb,*
and is adopted by *Bloomfield.* That arrangements of this kind are found
in the New Testament, and even in this Epistle is what cannot be
doubted. But the last word, “perfected,” will not admit of the meaning
given to it, “he *is* and *was,* and *shall be* everlastingly perfect
and free from sin.” Were this its meaning, there would be a complete
correspondence with the former part. Perfection is twice before applied
to Christ in this Epistle, (<span id="xx.xxvi-p3.1"></span>[Heb.
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010), [Heb.
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#009)<span id="xx.xxvi-p3.1"></span>,)
but not in the sense above stated. When Christ is said to be perfected
or made perfect, the meaning is that he is completely fitted and
qualified for his undertaking, or that he has fully completed his work
of expiation. Here the meaning seems to be that he is for ever made
perfect as a priest, having not only once for all made an adequate
atonement for the sins of his people, but also continues a priest for
ever.

<span id="xx.xxvi-p4"></span>As to the 27th verse, it may be thus
rendered, —

<span id="xx.xxvi-p5"></span>**27.** “Who has no need daily to offer
sacrifices, as the high priests, (first for their own sins, and then for
those of the people:) for this he did once for all, when he offered up
himself”

<span id="xx.xxvi-p6"></span>“This he did” refers only to the offering
of a sacrifice, and “for their own sins,” etc., apply only to the high
priests. Thus we avoid the difficulty alluded to.

<span id="xx.xxvi-p7"></span>From an idea that the high priest offered
sacrifices only once a year, *i.e., on* the day of expiation,
*Macknight* renders καθ ἡμέραν “from time to time,” etc. He considers it
as equivalent to κατ ἐναυτὸν “from year to year,” in <span
id="xx.xxvi-p7.1"></span>[Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001)<span id="xx.xxvi-p7.1"></span>,
and refers to <span id="xx.xxvi-p7.2"></span>[Ex
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#010)<span id="xx.xxvi-p7.2"></span>,
where “from year to year” is in Hebrew from “days to days,” and the same
in the *Sept.,* ἀφ᾿ ἡμερῶν εἰς ἡμέρας. Whether the high priest offered
sacrifices daily, is what cannot be ascertained from Scripture, though
*Stuart* refers to <span id="xx.xxvi-p7.3"></span>[Le
6:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#019)<span
id="xx.xxvi-p7.3"></span>, and <span id="xx.xxvi-p7.4"></span>[Num.
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#003),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#004)<span id="xx.xxvi-p7.4"></span>,
where nothing satisfactory is found. He quotes indeed some words from
*Philo,* who says that this was the case. *Scott* considered that what
was done daily by the priests is here attributed to the high priest,
they being his coadjutors. But *Macknight’s* explanation *is* the most
satisfactory, especially as the comparison throughout is between Christ
and the high priest.

<span id="xx.xxvi-p8"></span>The 28th verse may be thus rendered,—

<span id="xx.xxvi-p9"></span>“For the law made men high priests, who
have infirmity; but the word of the oath, the Son, perfected for ever.”

<span id="xx.xxvi-p10"></span>“Perfected,” or completely qualified, that
is, as a priest. The word, perfected, depends as to its specific meaning
on the context. The subject here is the perpetuity of the priest. The
high priests under the Law did not continue because of death, (<span
id="xx.xxvi-p10.1"></span>[Heb
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#023)<span id="xx.xxvi-p10.1"></span>,)
and this is the “infirmity” mentioned here, though in another place,
(<span id="xx.xxvi-p10.2"></span>[Heb
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#002)<span id="xx.xxvi-p10.2"></span>,)
it means sinfulness. Then the perfection of the Son is the perpetuity of
his life, referred to in verses 16 and 24. The high priests died, and
hence were not fitted for their work; but Christ lives, and therefore
continues for ever fully qualified for his office. See <span
id="xx.xxvi-p10.3"></span>[Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026)<span id="xx.xxvi-p10.3"></span>.

<span id="xx.xxvii"></span>

<span id="xx.xxvii-p1"></span>APPENDIX D 2

<span id="xx.xxvii-p2"></span>**Chapter 8:1.** *This is the sum, etc*
Many think that the word κεφάλαιον does not mean here a sum in the sense
of a summary, but a principal thing. So *Chrysostom* understood it.
*Macknight’s* version is, “Now of the things spoken the chief is;”
*Stuart’s* is substantially the same. But the idea seems to be somewhat
different: the literal rendering is, “Now the head as to the things said
is,” etc.; that is, the sum total, the whole amount.

<span id="xx.xxvii-p3"></span>*Parkhurst* quotes a passage from
*Menander* which is very similar to the first part of this verse, Τὸ δὲ
κεφάλιιον τῶν λόγων ῎Ανθρωπος εἶ— “But the sum of my discourse is, Thou
art a man,” etc. The word means here the substance or the sum total. The
word <span id="xx.xxvii-p3.1"></span>ראש, read, in Hebrew, has a like
meaning, the total number of the people, <span
id="xx.xxvii-p3.2"></span>[Ex
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#012)<span id="xx.xxvii-p3.2"></span>;
<span id="xx.xxvii-p3.3"></span>[Nu
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#002)<span id="xx.xxvii-p3.3"></span>

<span id="xx.xxviii"></span>

<span id="xx.xxviii-p1"></span>APPENDIX E 2

<span id="xx.xxviii-p2"></span>**Chapter 8:9.** *And I regarded them
not, etc* The Apostle here follows the *Sept.,* though in some other
parts of this quotation he follows more closely the Hebrew. Our version
in <span id="xx.xxviii-p2.1"></span>[Jer
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032)<span
id="xx.xxviii-p2.1"></span>, is, “although I was a husband to them,”
which is not countenanced by any of the earlier versions. The phrase is
peculiar, not found anywhere else except in <span
id="xx.xxviii-p2.2"></span>[Jer
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#017)<span id="xx.xxviii-p2.2"></span>;
which is rendered by *Kimchi,* “I have abhorred them.”

<span id="xx.xxviii-p3"></span>The verb means to have, to possess, to
rule, to exercise dominion, to marry; and *Pocock* and some others
think, that it means to loathe, to disdain, to abhor, when followed as
here by the preposition <span id="xx.xxviii-p3.1"></span>ב and it is
said that its cognate in Arabic has this meaning. The *Vulg*. here is,
“and I have ruled over them;” and the *Syr.,* “and I have despised
them.” The expression is softened by the *Sept.,* “and I have
disregarded (or cared not) for them.” The same is done as to the
preceding clause, “because they continued not in my covenant,” which is
in Hebrew, though not as rendered in our version, “because they broke my
covenant.” So <span id="xx.xxviii-p3.2"></span>אשר rendered by the
*Syr.* and the *Targ.* “Which my covenant” has been derived from the
*Vulg*., and is a construction which the original will not bear.

<span id="xx.xxviii-p4"></span>Still the most probable and the easiest
solution is, to suppose a typographical mistake in <span
id="xx.xxviii-p4.1"></span>[Jer
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032)<span
id="xx.xxviii-p4.1"></span>, the word <span
id="xx.xxviii-p4.2"></span>בעלתי: being used instead of <span
id="xx.xxviii-p4.3"></span>בחלתי: there being only one letter different.
The reasons for this supposition are these: — All the versions are
different here from what they are in <span
id="xx.xxviii-p4.4"></span>[Jer
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#017)<span id="xx.xxviii-p4.4"></span>,
where the same phrase is supposed to occur, — and this latter verb is
found in <span id="xx.xxviii-p4.5"></span>[Zec
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#008)<span id="xx.xxviii-p4.5"></span>,
followed by: as here, and means to “abhor,” or according to some, to
“reject.”

<span id="xx.xxviii-p5"></span>There is also another word, <span
id="xx.xxviii-p5.1"></span>נעלתי which has been mentioned, and has but
one letter different; and as it is used by Jeremiah himself in chapter
<span id="xx.xxviii-p5.2"></span>[Jer
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#019)<span
id="xx.xxviii-p5.2"></span>, and with <span
id="xx.xxviii-p5.3"></span>ב, in the sense of abhorring or loathing, it
may justly be deemed as the most probable word.

<span id="xx.xxviii-p6"></span>But *Newcome* suggests another thing, a
typographical mistake in the Greek. There is another reading in some
copies of the *Sept.,* and that is, εμελησα, “I have cared for them;”
and this would in substance agree with “I was a husband to them.” This
conjecture is less probable; for it involves a mistake both in the
*Sept.* and in this Epistle. But either of these suppositions would
reconcile the passages; and it is singular that in both cases the change
required is only in *one* letter!

<span id="xx.xxix"></span>

<span id="xx.xxix-p1"></span>APPENDIX F 2

<span id="xx.xxix-p2"></span>**Chapter 9:2** *The first, etc. Doddridge,
Macknight,* and *Stuart,* connect “the first” with “tabernacle,” but
improperly. The rendering ought to be no doubt as in our version, or as
follows, “For a tabernacle was made; the first, in which were the
candlestick, and the table, and the shew­bread, which is called holy.”
We find in verse 3, that “the Holy of holies” is also called a
tabernacle, which was as it were the second tabernacle, or the second
part of it, see <span id="xx.xxix-p2.1"></span>[Heb
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007)<span id="xx.xxix-p2.1"></span>.
The word “holy,” followed by “of holies,” is an adjective agreeing in
gender with tabernacle; and “of holies” seem to mean holy things; so
that it might be rendered, “The holy tabernacle of holy things.” The
accents are of no authority. The word “holy” in the plural with an
article, as in verse 8 and 12, designates the Holy of holies; or it may
refer to both places, the sanctuary and the Holy of holies, for the
people were excluded from both; and no access, strictly speaking,
applied to them only.

<span id="xx.xxx"></span>

<span id="xx.xxx-p1"></span>APPENDIX G 2

<span id="xx.xxx-p2"></span>**Chapter 9:9, 10.** These two verses have
greatly tried the ingenuity of critics, not as to the general meaning,
but as to the construction. All agree as to the general import of the
passage, and yet they find a difficulty in the syntax. This has arisen
from not apprehending the style of the Apostle; he often arranges his
sentences according to the practice of the ancient prophets. So he does
here. In verse ninth he mentions two things, “gifts” or oblations and
“sacrifices;” then he refers first to “sacrifices,” and afterwards to
the “gifts.” Of the “sacrifices,” he says, that they could not perfect
or justify “the worshipper,” for so λατρευόντα ought to be rendered
here; but of “the gifts,” together with meats, etc., he says, that they
were only imposed until the time of reformation. Here syntax is
satisfied. The two verses may be thus rendered, —

<span id="xx.xxx-p3"></span>**9.** “Which is a type for the present
time, while gifts and sacrifices are offered, which (sacrifices) cannot
perfect the

<span id="xx.xxx-p4"></span>**10.** worshipper as to his conscience,
being imposed (gifts) only, together with meats, and drinks, and divers
washings, even ordinances of the flesh, until the time of reformation.”

<span id="xx.xxx-p5"></span>Now, there is here a consistency in every
part; δυνάμεναι is in the same gender with θυσίαι*,* and what is said is
suitable to sacrifices, they being not able to atone for sin; and then
ἐπικείμενα *is* of the same gender with δῶρά, and what is said of them
is also suitable, that they were imposed or required only, together with
meats, etc., which were rituals referring to the flesh or body, and not
to the conscience or the soul, until the time of reforming or rectifying
all things came.

<span id="xx.xxx-p6"></span>*Doddridge* rightly states the efficacy of
the Jewish sacrifices when he says, that they averted “temporal evils,”
but did expiate offenses in the court above; they removed offenses
against the government under which the Jews lived, and restored them to
the privileges of eternal communion with the Church; and thus they were
types and symbols of the efficacy of the true sacrifices by which we are
restored to the favor of God, and to a spiritual communion with him.

<span id="xx.xxxi"></span>

<span id="xx.xxxi-p1"></span>APPENDIX H 2

<span id="xx.xxxi-p2"></span>**Chapter 9:16, 17.** Much has been written
on the meaning of the word διαθήκη in this passage. It is rendered
“covenant” throughout by *Doddridge, Macknight, Scholefield, etc.;* and
*Scott* is disposed to take the same view. *Macknight’s* version is
this, —

<span id="xx.xxxi-p3"></span>**16.** “For where a covenant is, there is
a necessity that the

<span id="xx.xxxi-p4"></span>**17.** death of the appointed sacrifice be
brought in; for a covenant is firm over dead sacrifices, since it never
hath force whilst the appointed sacrifice liveth.”

<span id="xx.xxxi-p5"></span>The difficulty here is as to the word
διαθέμενος, rendered above, “the appointed sacrifice,” — by *Doddridge,*
“he by whom the covenant is confirmed,” — and by *Scholefield,* “the
mediating sacrifice.” But the word is never found to have such meanings
in the New Testament, in the *Sept.,* or in the classics. It is
therefore impossible to accede to such a view of the passage.

<span id="xx.xxxi-p6"></span>It is then said, on the other hand, that
διαθήκη does not mean a testament or a will in the New Testament nor in
the *Sept.* This is not true; for it clearly means a testament or a will
in <span id="xx.xxxi-p6.1"></span>[Ga
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015)<span id="xx.xxxi-p6.1"></span>,
and in connection, too, with its common meaning, a covenant, see <span
id="xx.xxxi-p6.2"></span>[Ga 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017)<span
id="xx.xxxi-p6.2"></span>. Besides it has commonly, if not always, this
meaning in the classics.

<span id="xx.xxxi-p7"></span>These two verses are to be viewed as an
illustration, and may be regarded as parenthetic; and were γὰρ rendered
“in fact,” or indeed, this would appear more evident, “Where indeed a
testament is,” etc. As an illustration, a reference to a testament is
exceedingly suitable; for with regard to Christ, his death was really
the ratification of the covenant; as by death a Will attains its
validity, so by Christ’s death the covenant of which he is the Mediator.
Death in both instances has a similar effect. And this, and no more than
this, seems to have been the intention of the Apostle. The different
meaning of the same word in the same passage is to be found out by words
connected with it; in the present instance διαθέμενος is sufficient,
independently of the 17th verse, which can be rightly applied to nothing
but to a will or a testament.

<span id="xx.xxxi-p8"></span>Many agree with *Calvin* on these verses,
such as *Erasmus, Beza, Schleusner, Stuart, Bloomfield, etc.*

<span id="xx.xxxii"></span>

<span id="xx.xxxii-p1"></span>APPENDIX I 2

<span id="xx.xxxii-p2"></span>**Chapter 10:5** *But a body hast thou
prepared me* The words in the Psalm are, “Mine ears hast thou opened,”
<span id="xx.xxxii-p2.1"></span>[Ps
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006)<span id="xx.xxxii-p2.1"></span>;
or more literally, “Ears hast thou opened for me.” *Calvin* seems to
have discarded the idea of an allusion to the boring of the ear in sign
of servitude. The two verbs are certainly different. He evidently refers
to <span id="xx.xxxii-p2.2"></span>[Isa
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005)<span
id="xx.xxxii-p2.2"></span>*,* “The Lord hath opened mine ear, and I was
not rebellious;” which clearly applies to Christ. He therefore makes the
meaning of the phrase to be, “Thou hast made me teachable and obedient.”
This view has been adopted by *Merrick, Bishop Horne,* and *Stuart.* But
how to make the words, “a body hast thou prepared for me,” to bear an
analogous meaning, does not very clearly appear. *Bishop* *Horne* gives
this version, “Thou hast prepared” or fitted “my body,” that is, to be
obedient and to do thy will.

<span id="xx.xxxii-p3"></span>*Mede* conceived that the allusion is to
the practice of boring the ear in token of servitude, mentioned in <span
id="xx.xxxii-p3.1"></span>[Ex
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006)<span id="xx.xxxii-p3.1"></span>;
and that as that practice was unknown to the Greeks, the *Seventy*
rendered the words in conformity with what they did as to their slaves;
which was, to set a mark on the body; “Thou hast fitted (or adapted) a
body for me;” that is, that I might be thy servant. That Christ assumed
“the form of a servant,” is expressly declared in <span
id="xx.xxxii-p3.2"></span>[Php
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007)<span id="xx.xxxii-p3.2"></span>.
There is in this case an agreement as to meaning; but the difficulty is:
as to the verb <span id="xx.xxxii-p3.3"></span>כרה which does not mean
to bore or to perforate, but to dig, to hollow out, and in a secondary
sense, to form or to make a thing, such as a well, a pit, a grave, or a
cave. As to “ears” instead of an “ear,” as in <span
id="xx.xxxii-p3.4"></span>[Ex
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006)<span id="xx.xxxii-p3.4"></span>,
that might be accounted for by saying, that the object was to shew the
*entire* willingness of Christ to become a servant.

<span id="xx.xxxii-p4"></span>These have been the two ways proposed to
reconcile the passages as they now stand. There are no different
readings in Hebrew, nor in the *Sept.,* nor in this Epistle. Proposals
have therefore been made as to a change in the texts on the supposition
of typographical mistakes.

<span id="xx.xxxii-p5"></span>Some, as *Grotius, Hammond,* and *Dr.
Owen,* have proposed ὠτία, ears, instead of σῶμα, body, in the *Sept.*
When did this change take place? Before or after the Apostle’s time? If
before, then the Apostle adopted a false reading; if after, then the
same mistake must have been made in the *Sept.* and in this Epistle;
which is not credible.

<span id="xx.xxxii-p6"></span>Others have supposed a mistake in the
Hebrew text; and this conjecture has been approved by *Kennicott,
Doddridge,* Bishop *lowth,* Adam *Clarke,* and Pye *Smith.* It is no
objection to say that the *Syr., Vulg.,* and the *Targ.,* confirm the
present reading; for the mistake might have been made long before any of
these were in existence. Such a change might indeed have been made in
the first ages of Christianity, and might have been made intentionally,
through a wish to obscure the testimony of Scripture respecting Christ.

<span id="xx.xxxii-p7"></span>The words are supposed to have been <span
id="xx.xxxii-p7.1"></span>אז גוה instead of <span
id="xx.xxxii-p7.2"></span>אזנים, as the text now is. There would in this
case be a literal agreement; the passage in the Psalm might then be thus
rendered, —

<span id="xx.xxxii-p8"></span>**6.** “Sacrifice and offering thou hast
not delighted in, Then a body hast thou formed for me; Burnt­offering
and sin­offering thou hast not required,

<span id="xx.xxxii-p9"></span>**7.** Then I said, Behold, I am coming.”
—

<span id="xx.xxxii-p10"></span>There is here a consistency throughout.
“Behold, I am coming,” that is, in the body designed for him. And then
the Apostle says, “When coming into the world, he saith,” etc., clearly
referring to our Saviors incarnation. And this “body” is afterwards
expressly mentioned in verse 10, in opposition to sacrifices. It is true
that in his argument in verse 9, he dwells on the words, “I come;” but
then his coming was in the body prepared for him.

<span id="xx.xxxiii"></span>

<span id="xx.xxxiii-p1"></span>APPENDIX K 2

<span id="xx.xxxiii-p2"></span>**Chapter 10:14** *He hath perfected,
etc* The word simply means to complete, to finish, to perfect; and it
depends on the context what that completion or perfection means. To
perfect the sanctified or the expiated, or those atoned for, was
completely to free them from the imputation of sin, to make them fully
clear from guilt, or in other words, fully to take away their sins,
which was never done by the sacrifices of the law, verse 11. This is the
point here handled. *Stuart* gives the real meaning by the following
free translation, — “By one offering, then, he hath fully accomplished
for ever what was needed by those for whom expiation is (was) made.”

<span id="xx.xxxiii-p3"></span>The perfecting “for ever” by one offering
in this verse, proves that “for ever,” εἰς τὸ διηνεκὲς, in verse 12, is
to be connected with the offering of one sacrifice, and not with the
sitting on God’s right hand; the verse may be thus rendered, —

<span id="xx.xxxiii-p4"></span>**12.** “But he, having offered one
sacrifice for sins for perpetuity, (or, according to *Beza* and *Stuart,
‘*one perpetual sacrifice for sins,’) sat down on the right hand of God,
henceforth waiting until his enemies be made his footstool.”

<span id="xx.xxxiii-p5"></span>Some copies have αὐτὸς; — “he;” and some,
οὗτος; — “this.” If the latter be adopted, it ought not to be rendered
“this man,” but “this priest,” such being the word used before. As *one*
sacrifice is opposed to *many* sacrifices, so a *perpetual* sacrifice,
that is, a sacrifice perpetually efficacious, is opposed to those
sacrifices which were *often* made.

<span id="xx.xxxiv"></span>

<span id="xx.xxxiv-p1"></span>APPENDIX L 2

<span id="xx.xxxiv-p2"></span>**Chapter 10:19 21.** Of these verses the
following rendering is offered, —

<span id="xx.xxxiv-p3"></span>**19.** “Having then, brethren, liberty as
to an entrance into the

<span id="xx.xxxiv-p4"></span>**20.** holiest through the blood of
Jesus, which he has consecrated for us, a way new and leading to life,
through the

<span id="xx.xxxiv-p5"></span>**21.** veil, that is, his flesh, — and
having a great priest over the house of God, let us approach,” etc.

<span id="xx.xxxiv-p6"></span>It is rather “liberty” or freedom than
“boldness,” and so it is rendered by *Beza, Doddridge,* and *Stuart.*
The *Vulgate* has “confidence.” The word for “consecrated” is literally
“initiated:” Christ first opened the way, and opened it for his people.
The “way” is in apposition with “entrance.” It was “new,” in contrast
with the old under the Law, and living or “leading to life:” so ζῶσαν
evidently means here. It has often a causative sense. The “living bread”
in <span id="xx.xxxiv-p6.1"></span>[Joh
6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051)<span id="xx.xxxiv-p6.1"></span>,
is said in <span id="xx.xxxiv-p6.2"></span>[Joh
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033)<span id="xx.xxxiv-p6.2"></span>
to be the bread that “giveth life.” So here the living way may be said
to be that which leads to life.

<span id="xx.xxxiv-p7"></span>There is a division of opinion as to the
“veil.” *Calvin, Doddridge, Stuart,* and others, take the veil as a
figurative expression for the human nature of Christ; and they ground
their opinion on the following texts, <span
id="xx.xxxiv-p7.1"></span>[Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014)<span id="xx.xxxiv-p7.1"></span>;
<span id="xx.xxxiv-p7.2"></span>[1Ti
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)<span id="xx.xxxiv-p7.2"></span>;
<span id="xx.xxxiv-p7.3"></span>[Php
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006)<span id="xx.xxxiv-p7.3"></span>.
Others give this explanation, “As the veil was removed for the entrance
of the high priest, so Christ s body was removed by death, in order to
open an entrance into heaven.” But the easiest and the most natural way
is to consider it an allusion to what took place at our Saviors death,
the rending asunder of the veil of the temple, (<span
id="xx.xxxiv-p7.4"></span>[Mt
27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051)<span
id="xx.xxxiv-p7.4"></span>,) which was a significant intimation and a
striking symbol of what was done by Christ when he died on the cross. It
was by his flesh or body being torn and rent, when suffering for us,
that a way to the holiest was opened to us, and the same is ascribed to
his blood in the former verse, so that one part corresponds with the
other. The way was opened through the veil being rent, which symbolized
his rent or torn flesh.

<span id="xx.xxxv"></span>

<span id="xx.xxxv-p1"></span>APPENDIX M 2

<span id="xx.xxxv-p2"></span>**Chapter 10:22.** *With* *pure water* It
is evident that baptism is not here referred to, because the Apostle is
instructing the Hebrews, who had been baptized, how they were daily to
draw nigh to God.

<span id="xx.xxxv-p3"></span>The words “pure water” are not found
elsewhere in the New Testament, nor in the *Sept.* but once, <span
id="xx.xxxv-p3.1"></span>[Eze
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025)<span id="xx.xxxv-p3.1"></span>,
where our version is “purifying water,” and no doubt correctly, though
the early versions have “pure water.” It was a command as to Aaron, “He
shall wash (λούσεται) with water his whole body (πάν τὸ σῶμα;)” So the
*Sept.,* but the Hebrew is “his flesh,” (<span
id="xx.xxxv-p3.2"></span>בשרו,) though the Samaritan text has “all,”
(<span id="xx.xxxv-p3.3"></span>כל) before it, <span
id="xx.xxxv-p3.4"></span>[Le 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#004)<span
id="xx.xxxv-p3.4"></span>. See also <span id="xx.xxxv-p3.5"></span>[Le
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#024)<span id="xx.xxxv-p3.5"></span>.
The terms here used are sacerdotal or Levitical. The “sprinkled” with
blood were the priests at their consecration, and not those who brought
their offerings. See <span id="xx.xxxv-p3.6"></span>[Le
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#030)<span id="xx.xxxv-p3.6"></span>.
In no other case were any sprinkled with blood except the lepers, and
the people when the covenant was made. Washing with water was also done
by the priests at their consecration, (see <span
id="xx.xxxv-p3.7"></span>[Le 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#006)<span
id="xx.xxxv-p3.7"></span>,) and whenever they ministered. (<span
id="xx.xxxv-p3.8"></span>[Exod. 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#020),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#021)<span id="xx.xxxv-p3.8"></span>.)

<span id="xx.xxxv-p4"></span>The reason of this allusion especially to
what was done as to the priests, seems to have been this, to shew that
all who now draw nigh to God through Christ are priests, for they all
serve God as it were in the sanctuary, and like the high priest, enter
as it were into the holiest, not once a year, but daily and constantly,
whenever they hold communion with God.

<span id="xx.xxxv-p5"></span>As sprinkling in the case of Christians is
continually needed, so is washing, as the daily washing of the priests
before they engaged in their duties. (<span id="xx.xxxv-p5.1"></span>[Ex
40:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#032)<span id="xx.xxxv-p5.1"></span>.)
The sprinkling betokens forgiveness, and washing, sanctification or
cleansing. See <span id="xx.xxxv-p5.2"></span>[1Pe
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002)<span id="xx.xxxv-p5.2"></span>;
and <span id="xx.xxxv-p5.3"></span>[1Co
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001)<span id="xx.xxxv-p5.3"></span>;
<span id="xx.xxxv-p5.4"></span>[1Th
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023)<span id="xx.xxxv-p5.4"></span>.

<span id="xx.xxxv-p6"></span>It may be added that as (ζῶσαν, living,
seems to have been used in <span id="xx.xxxv-p6.1"></span>[Heb
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020)<span id="xx.xxxv-p6.1"></span>
in a causative sense, so καθαρὸν in this passage; and it may be
rendered, as in <span id="xx.xxxv-p6.2"></span>[Eze
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025)<span id="xx.xxxv-p6.2"></span>,
“purifying.” The priests after washing were said to be clean, and were
deemed to have been thereby purified, which proves that washing was
nothing more than a symbol. Pure or purifying water signifies the
sanctifying effect of divine grace.

<span id="xx.xxxvi"></span>

<span id="xx.xxxvi-p1"></span>APPENDIX N 2

<span id="xx.xxxvi-p2"></span>**Chapter 10:26.** *Willfully, etc*. It is
rendered by the *Vulg*., “<span id="xx.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>voluntarie —
voluntarily;” by *Beza,* “<span id="xx.xxxvi-p2.2"></span>ultro — of
one’s own accord;” by *Doddridge* and *Macknight,* as in our version,
and by *Stuart,* “voluntarily.”

<span id="xx.xxxvi-p3"></span>It occurs in one other place, (<span
id="xx.xxxvi-p3.1"></span>[1Pe
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002)<span id="xx.xxxvi-p3.1"></span>,)
and is rendered “willingly;” it is found as an adjective in <span
id="xx.xxxvi-p3.2"></span>[Phm
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#014)<span id="xx.xxxvi-p3.2"></span>,
and is rendered willingly; and in both instances in opposition to
“constraint.” So that *Schleusner’s* explanation seems right, “with no
compelling force — <span id="xx.xxxvi-p3.3"></span>nulla vi cogente.” It
is used in the *Sept.* for a Hebrew word which means freely, with free
will, spontaneously. We may therefore thus render the words, “For if we
sin of our own free will, (that is, renounce the faith, which is clearly
the sin intended,) after having received the knowledge of the truth,
there remains no more a sacrifice for sins.”

<span id="xx.xxxvi-p4"></span>According to this verse the case of the
persecuted is not here contemplated, for they are under constraint; but
such are spoken of here as renounced the faith willingly, freely, by
their own free choice; so that “willfully” is not what is meant, but
spontaneously, without any outward constraining force or influence.

<span id="xx.xxxvi-p5"></span>The fathers, such as *Chrysostom,
Theophylact,* and *Augustine,* sadly blundered on this passage, because
they did not understand the sin that is here intended, though it be
evidently that of apostasy according to the drift of the whole context;
and hence they said some strange things about sin after baptism, though
baptism is neither mentioned nor alluded to in the whole passage. How
many errors and absurdities have been introduced by the fathers into the
world!

<span id="xx.xxxvii"></span>

<span id="xx.xxxvii-p1"></span>APPENDIX O 2

<span id="xx.xxxvii-p2"></span>**Chapter 10:30** *The Lord shall judge*
The same meaning is given to “judge” here by *Beza* as by *Calvin;* but
*Doddridge, Grotius,* and *Macknight* think it means to avenge, to
vindicate, or defend. The argument is considered to be this, — “If God
would avenge the injury done to his people, much more the injury or
reproach done to his Son and the Holy Spirit.” *Stuart* and *Bloomfield*
give the verb the sense of condemning or punishing; that is, his
apostatizing people, — “The Lord will condemn (or punish) his people.”

<span id="xx.xxxvii-p3"></span>The two quotations are connected in <span
id="xx.xxxvii-p3.1"></span>[Deut.
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035),
[36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036)<span id="xx.xxxvii-p3.1"></span>.
“Vengeance” refers to idolaters; and lest an advantage should have been
taken of this, he added, as it seems, these words, “The Lord will judge
his people;” that is, he will call his people to an account, so as to
reward some, and to punish others. The apostates might have said,
“Though we leave the Christian, and turn to the Jewish religion, we
shall not be idolaters; therefore the vengeance you threaten will not
belong to us. To prevent this kind of evasion, the Apostle adds, “The
Lord will summon to judgment his own people, and give to each according
to their works. The fact, that God is a judge, who will reward some and
punish others, is what is meant; and this view accords with the passage
in Deuteronomy, and also with the design of the Apostle here.

<span id="xx.xxxvii-p4"></span>The two verbs also, the Hebrew <span
id="xx.xxxvii-p4.1"></span>ידין, and the Greek κρινεῖ, will admit of
this meaning. The first, indeed, though not the second, often means to
vindicate, to defend; but the context in <span
id="xx.xxxvii-p4.2"></span>[De
32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036)<span
id="xx.xxxvii-p4.2"></span>*,* requires its sense to be that of
executing what is right and just to all. See <span
id="xx.xxxvii-p4.3"></span>[Ge
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#006)<span id="xx.xxxvii-p4.3"></span>

<span id="xx.xxxviii"></span>

<span id="xx.xxxviii-p1"></span>APPENDIX P 2

<span id="xx.xxxviii-p2"></span>**Chapter 12:1.** *Which doth so easily
beset us, etc. Calvin* follows the *Vulg*., “which surrounds us, or
stands around us. It is rendered by *Chrysostom,* “which easily
surrounds us; *by Beza,* “which is ready to encompass us;” by
*Doddridge,* “which in present circumstances hath the greatest advantage
against us;” *by Macknight,* “easily committed.”

<span id="xx.xxxviii-p3"></span>The word εὐπερίστατον means literally,
“well­standing­around.” But εὐ in composition often means readily,
easily, aptly. Then we may render it, “the readily surrounding sin,”
that *is,* the sin which readily surrounds us, and thereby entangle us,
so as to prevent as, like long garments, to run our course. The runners
threw aside every weight or burden, and also their long garments. These
two things seem to have been alluded to. Therefore the second clause is
not explanatory of the preceding, as some consider it, but is wholly a
distinct thing; there was the burden and the readily entangling sin. The
burden was probably worldly cares, or as *Theophylact says,* “the
baggage of earthly concerns;” and the easily encircling sin seems to
have been the fear of persecution as *Doddridge* suggests; which, if
allowed to prevail, would lead them to apostasy.

<span id="xx.xxxviii-p4"></span>If the word be taken in an active sense,
then what is meant is the deceptive power of sin, it being that which
readily surrounds and allures us; but if it be taken passively, then
what *is* specifically meant *is,* that the sin referred to is that
which stands fairly and plausibly around us; for “well­standing­around”
is what presents on every side a fair and plausible appearance. And
apostasy might have been so represented; for the Jews could produce many
plausible arguments. *Scapula* says that ἀπερίστατος is applied by the
Greek rhetoricians to a question barely or briefly stated, unaccompanied
with any circumstances; then, if instead of the negative, ευ*,* well, be
prefixed to it, the meaning would be that it is something well stated
and plausibly represented. The version in this case would be, “the sin
that plausibly presents itself” If this meaning be received, then there
seems to be a striking contrast in the passage; we are surrounded by a
throng of witnesses, and also by sin with its plausible pretenses. It
*is* usual with Paul to personify sin.

<span id="xx.xxxix"></span>

<span id="xx.xxxix-p1"></span>APPENDIX Q 2

<span id="xx.xxxix-p2"></span>**Chapter 12:2.** *Who for the joy, etc*.
Hardly any agree with *Calvin* in the view he takes of this clause. The
preposition is, indeed, used in both senses; but the words, “set before
him,” and the argument, evidently favor the other view. The subject
handled is, that the prospect of future glory ought to sustain us under
the evils of the present life; and Christ is referred to as an example;
and the Apostle says, that he for the sake of the joy set before him
endured the cross. The same word is here used and rendered, “set before
him,” as in <span id="xx.xxxix-p2.1"></span>[Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018)<span id="xx.xxxix-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xx.xxxix-p3"></span>The first clause of the verse is rendered
by *Calvin,* “the prince and perfecter of the faith;” by *Beza*, “the
leader and consummator of the faith;” by *Doddridge,* “the leader and
finisher of *our* faith;” by *Macknight,* “the captain and perfecter of
the faith,” and by *Stuart,* “the author and perfecter of *our* faith.”
The first word is rendered “author” by the *Vulg*., and “the beginner”
by *Erazmus.* Following this meaning we may render thus, “the beginner
and perfecter of the faith,” that is, of the Gospel, or of the religion
we profess. Christ being the author or originator, and also the complete
revealer of the faith, of what we profess to believe, may fitly be set
forth as our example. This is the view of *Stuart.*

<span id="xx.xxxix-p4"></span>*Doddridge* takes faith as a principle,
that is, subjective faith, faith in us; so *Theophylact* did, “He at
first gives us faith, and afterwards brings it to perfection.” *Scott*
mentions this view, and then adds, “From him as the great Prophet, the
*doctrine* of faith had been delivered from the beginning, and perfected
in the revelation made in the Gospel; and this none would ever be
authorized to change, add to, or deduct from.”

<span id="xx.xxxix-p5"></span>But the reference here seems to be to what
Christ did in his own person, as it appears from what follows; he
endured the cross, which seems to refer to the first word, “leader;” and
his sitting down at God’s right hand appears to be explanatory of his
being the consummator of the faith. The Apostle’s subject is the race,
that is, the race of faith, or in behalf of the faith we profess. Christ
is the captain or leader in this race of faith; and though he had the
cross to endure, he yet completed it, and is now at God’s right hand.
This is the example that is presented to us. *Schleusner* explains
τελειωτὴν as one who brings anything to an end, a finisher, a completer.
Christ is the captain or leader in the contest of faith, and the
completer of it, having brought it to a triumphant issue.

<span id="xx.xl"></span>

<span id="xx.xl-p1"></span>APPENDIX R 2

<span id="xx.xl-p2"></span>**Chapter 12:6** *For whom the Lord loveth,
etc* The quotation is from <span id="xx.xl-p2.1"></span>[Prov.
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012)<span id="xx.xl-p2.1"></span>, made
from the *Sept.,* consistently with the Hebrew, except in the last
clause; which in Hebrew is, “As a father, the Son in whom he delights.”
Some have unwisely attempted to amend one of the words in Hebrew, while
there are *three* words which must be altered if we attach importance to
verbal identity; and even the amended word can hardly answer the
purpose, a sense being given to it, which it has nowhere else.

<span id="xx.xl-p3"></span>If we make <span id="xx.xl-p3.1"></span>כאב:
a verb, it will not be suitable, for its meaning is to be sore, to be
sad, to be sorrowful, and is ever used intransitively; and if like
*Schleusner,* we make it a <span id="xx.xl-p3.2"></span>יכאיב, it will
hardly bear the meaning here required; it is used in the sense of making
sore, sad, or sorrowful. This, indeed, approaches to a verbal identity;
but then there is “every” to be put in, and “delights in” is to be
changed into “receiveth.” To be over­scrupulous about words, when the
general meaning is the same, is neither wise nor reasonable, but wholly
puerile; it is a disposition clearly discountenanced by the usage of
Scripture, there being many passages in which the meaning *is* given but
not the words. Even in this Epistle the same passage *is* quoted twice,
but in different words. See <span id="xx.xl-p3.3"></span>[Heb.
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#012), [Heb.
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#017)<span id="xx.xl-p3.3"></span>

<span id="xx.xl-p4"></span>The *Vulg*., the *Syr.,* and the *Targ.,*
materially agree with the Hebrew text as it *is.* The *Arab.* alone
favors the *Sept. Macknight* quotes *Hallet* as saying, that the *Syr.*
and the *Targ.,* as well as the *Arab.,* coincide with the *Sept.;*
which is quite a mistake. The *Syr.* is, “For whom the Lord loveth he
correcteth, like a father who correcteth his own son;” and the *Targ*.
is nearly the same, the word “father” being retained. And then what this
author says as to the meaning of the verb <span
id="xx.xl-p4.1"></span>כאב: is not true; there is no instance in which
it is used in the sense of scourging. We must not pervert the meaning of
words, or invent a new meaning, to gratify a fond desire for verbal
agreement.

<span id="xx.xl-p5"></span>But there is in this quotation what deserves
special notice. “Correction” was by the rod; so we find the rod and
correction joined together in <span id="xx.xl-p5.1"></span>[Pr
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#015)<span id="xx.xl-p5.1"></span>. In
Hebrew it is “the rod of correction (<span
id="xx.xl-p5.2"></span>מוסר),” and in the *Sept.,* “rod and correction
(παιδεία.)” In <span id="xx.xl-p5.3"></span>[Pr
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#013)<span id="xx.xl-p5.3"></span>,
correction and beating with the rod are represented as the same thing.
Bearing this in mind, we shall understand the connection and meaning of
this passage, —

<span id="xx.xl-p6"></span>**11.** The correction of the Lord, my Son,
despise not, — And fret not at his chastisement;

<span id="xx.xl-p7"></span>**12.** For whom the Lord loveth he
chastiseth, And *corrects* as a father the Son he graciously accepts.

<span id="xx.xl-p8"></span>The middle lines are *evidently* connected;
chastisement is the subject of both, the noun and the verb are from the
same root. Then the first and the fourth are also connected; the “Son”
is mentioned in both; and the verb in the last line must be borrowed
from the subject of the first line, and that is correction. We hence see
the reason why μαστιγοῖ is introduced, it being nothing more than to
supply what is left to be understood in Hebrew.

<span id="xx.xli"></span>

<span id="xx.xli-p1"></span>APPENDIX S 2

<span id="xx.xli-p2"></span>**Chapter 12:11.** *Peaceable fruit of
righteousness, etc* This is a phrase which is commonly understood as to
its general import, and yet it is difficult to explain it
satisfactorily. Some take “of righteousness” as the exegetic genitive
case, “the peaceable fruit,” that is, as *Macknight* explains it, “which
is righteousness;” and he adds, “Righteousness is denominated
*peaceful,* because it is productive of inward peace to the afflicted
person himself, and of outward peace to them with whom he lives; also it
is called the fruit of God’s chastisements, because afflictions have a
natural tendency to produce virtues in the chastised, which are the
occasion of joy far greater than the pain arising from the
chastisement.” <span id="xx.xli-p2.1"></span>[Ps.
119:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#067),
[71](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#071),
[75](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#075)<span id="xx.xli-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xx.xli-p3"></span>*Doddridge* also seems to have understood
the phrase in the same sense, for he says, that chastisement “produces
and improves those virtues which afford joy and peace to the mind.” To
the same effect are the remarks of *Scott,* and *Calvin’s* view seems to
be similar.

<span id="xx.xli-p4"></span>The phrase admits of another meaning: “The
fruit of righteousness,” according to the more frequent usage of
Scripture, means the fruit which belongs to righteousness, or in the
words of *Stuart,* “such as righteousness produces,” or in the words of
an author quoted by *Poole,* “which proceeds from righteousness.”
Righteousness seems to mean here what is just and right, or what ought
to be done according to the will of God, as when our Savior says, “For
thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness,” <span
id="xx.xli-p4.1"></span>[Mt 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015)<span
id="xx.xli-p4.1"></span>. What may be deemed as especially referred to
here, is submission or subjection to the divine will mentioned in <span
id="xx.xli-p4.2"></span>[Heb 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009)<span
id="xx.xli-p4.2"></span>. This subjection was righteousness; it was
right according to the statement in <span id="xx.xli-p4.3"></span>[Heb
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#007)<span id="xx.xli-p4.3"></span>. It
was said before that the object of correction is to make us partakers of
God’s holiness; now he mentions righteousness; they are connected. We
must be made holy, we must be cleansed from pride, worldliness, and
self­will, in order that we may do what is right and just, that is,
submit to God’s will when he chastises us; and when this submission or
righteousness takes place, then correction produces a peaceable or a
blessed fruit, that is, such an effect, or such a blessing, as peace or
happiness. Peace and happiness are both signified by the word; but
“blessed” or happy is more suitably applied to “fruit” than “peaceable”
or peaceful.

<span id="xx.xli-p5"></span>Then the meaning may be thus conveyed, “but
it afterwards yields to those who are exercised (or trained, that is,
unto holiness) by it, a blessed fruit, such as righteousness (that is,
subjection to our Father’s will) brings forth.”

<span id="xx.xlii"></span>

<span id="xx.xlii-p1"></span>APPENDIX T 2

<span id="xx.xlii-p2"></span>**Chapter 12:13.** *And make straight
paths, etc.* If this be a quotation, and not an appropriation of certain
words, it is taken from <span id="xx.xlii-p2.1"></span>[Pr
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#026)<span id="xx.xlii-p2.1"></span>,
where the Hebrew *is,* “Make direct the path of thy feet;” and the
*Sept.,* “Make straight the paths for thy feet,” the very words of this
passage. That the verb in Hebrew means to “make direct,” and not to
“ponder,” as in our version, is evident from a similar phrase in <span
id="xx.xlii-p2.2"></span>[Ps
78:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#050)<span id="xx.xlii-p2.2"></span>,
“He made (or made direct) a way to his anger.” The verb is the same as
in Proverbs. The noun means a balance, or rather the beam of a balance,
(see <span id="xx.xlii-p2.3"></span>[Pr
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011)<span id="xx.xlii-p2.3"></span>,)
which is straight, and is used to equalize what is weighed. The verb may
therefore include the idea of making straight or of making even. The
verse that follows in <span id="xx.xlii-p2.4"></span>[Pr
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#026)<span id="xx.xlii-p2.4"></span>,
favors this idea of a straight path, “Turn not to the right hand nor to
the left,” which implies that it is a straight course that is to be
taken. See <span id="xx.xlii-p2.5"></span>[Pr
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#025)<span id="xx.xlii-p2.5"></span>

<span id="xx.xlii-p3"></span>“Make direct the path of thy feet,” or
“Make straight the paths for thy feet,” evidently means, “Let the path
or paths along which you go, be direct or straight.” The ways of error
and sin are called crooked paths: see <span id="xx.xlii-p3.1"></span>[Pr
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015)<span id="xx.xlii-p3.1"></span>;
<span id="xx.xlii-p3.2"></span>[Isa
59:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#008)<span id="xx.xlii-p3.2"></span>.
So the way of truth and holiness is compared to a straight line, from
which we are not to deviate either to the right hand or to the left.

<span id="xx.xlii-p4"></span>It is remarkable what the Apostle says in
<span id="xx.xlii-p4.1"></span>[Ga
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#014)<span id="xx.xlii-p4.1"></span>,
of Peter and those who dissembled with him, that they “did not walk
uprightly (or literally, did not foot straightly, οὐκ ὀρθοποδοῦσι)
according to the truth of the Gospel;” they deviated from the straight
line prescribed by the Gospel. The idea, therefore, of removing
impediments, of making their paths plain or smooth, as *Macknight* and
others render it, seems not to be here intended; nor does it comport
with what follows, “that the lame,” or the feeble, “may not turn aside,
but rather be healed,” that is, of his lameness, or his weakness. For
were those reputed strong in the faith not to walk straightly, but to
turn into the crooked ways of dissimulation, like Peter and others at
Antioch, the lame, the weak in faith, would be tempted to do the same,
instead of having their lameness healed, or their weakness strengthened
by the example of others walking in a straight course.

<span id="xx.xlii-p5"></span>The idea of dislocation given to ἐκτραπὣ by
*Schleusner, Macknight,* and others, is one invented for the purpose of
suiting what they conceived to be the meaning of this passage, which is
by no means necessary, and is indeed inappropriate to the context when
rightly understood. “That which is lame,” τὸ χωλὸν, is a neuter instead
of a masculine, an idiom we often meet with in the New Testament.

<span id="xx.xliii"></span>

<span id="xx.xliii-p1"></span>APPENDIX U 2

<span id="xx.xliii-p2"></span>**Chapter 12:15** *Lest any root, etc*
This quotation, made from <span id="xx.xliii-p2.1"></span>[De
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018)<span id="xx.xliii-p2.1"></span>,
seems to be an adoption of some words, and nothing more; for it is
neither literally the Hebrew nor the *Sept.* “Root” refers not to a
principle in Deuteronomy, but to an individual, to a person given to
idolatry. A person also seems to be intended here. The clause in Hebrew
is, “Lest there be among you a fruit­bearing root, hemlock or wormwood;”
and in the *Sept.,* “Lest there be among you a root springing up in gall
and bitterness.” As the idea only of a growing bitter or poisonous root
is borrowed, it is not necessary to suppose that the application here is
the same as in Deuteronomy. What is there applied to an idolater, is
here applied to a person disturbing the peace of the Church.

<span id="xx.xliii-p3"></span>Some understand this passage as referring
to defection or apostasy; and therefore render the first clause, “Lest
any one recede (or depart) from the grace of God,” that is, the Gospel,
or Christian faith. But the words can hardly admit of this meaning.
Hence most give this version, “Lest any one fall short of the grace of
God.” But what is this “grace of God?” Various answers have been given,
— God’s favor to those who cultivate holiness; God’s mercy offered in
the Gospel; the promised rest; eternal life. But taking this verse, as
we certainly ought, in connection with the preceding, we may justly say,
that it is God’s sanctifying grace, or “the holiness “mentioned before;
and then, according to the inverted order which we often find in
Scripture, the next clause refers to “peace,” “lest any root of
bitterness, growing up, should disturb you, and many by it (or by this)
be polluted (or infected.)”

<span id="xx.xliii-p4"></span>Then follow examples of these two evils in
the same order: the first, “the fornicator,” is the violator of
“holiness,” or is deficient as to this grace of God; and the second,
“the profane,” is a disturber of the peace of the Church, as Esau was,
of the peace of his own family, being “a root of bitterness.”

<span id="xx.xliii-p5"></span>But observe, “peace” was to be with “*all*
men;” yet the example as to the disturber of it refers to the peace of
the Church; so with respect to “holiness,” what is universal is
inculcated; but the example as to the violator of it is particular. For
want of seeing this, no doubt some of the fathers regarded “holiness” in
the former verse us meaning chastity.

<span id="xx.xliii-p6"></span>Esau became “a root of bitterness” by
being profane; and to be profane in this instance was to despise holy
things, to regard them of no value, so as to prefer to them the
gratification of the flesh. This was Esau’s profaneness, which led
eventually to a dreadful discord in his family; and to shew the evil
which follows such profaneness, the Apostle points out the loss he
sustained as a warning to others.

<span id="xx.xliv"></span>

<span id="xx.xliv-p1"></span>APPENDIX X 2

<span id="xx.xliv-p2"></span>**Chapter 12:18­24.** In this comparison
between the Law and the Gospel, it would no doubt be more consonant to
what is said in Exodus and also to the comparison here made, to regard
μὴ as a part of the text, though omitted in all the copies already
examined. Very seldom indeed is there any sufficient ground for a
conjecture of this kind; nor can it be said that there is here an
indispensable necessity for it, only that the comparison would be more
complete, — “Ye are not come to a mount not to be touched under the
peril of destruction; but to a mount to which you have a free access.”
So terrible was the delivery of the Law, that to touch the mountain was
instant death; to approach Sion is what we are graciously invited to do,
it being the city of God, who giveth life.” The participle ζῶν seems to
have this meaning here, as there appears no other reason why the word is
here applied to God.

<span id="xx.xliv-p3"></span>In describing the superiority of the Gospel
to the Law, the Apostle borrows expressions from the former
dispensation; and though Mount Sion and Jerusalem seemed to belong to
the Law, yet they are taken here in contrast with Sinai, where the Law
was proclaimed. Sion is, indeed, an evangelical term, and the whole
ceremonial Law, though added to the Law proclaimed on Mount Sinai, was
yet the Gospel typically, and existed in part before the Law was given.

<span id="xx.xliv-p4"></span>The contrast here is very striking: terror
and death were to the Israelites at Sinai; but a free approach and life
are to those who come to Sion: there were on Sinai angels, surrounded
with fire, darkness, and tempest; but myriads of them, an innumerable
host, are now ministering spirits to the inhabitants of Sion: the whole
assembly at the foot of Sinai were only the children of Israel; but the
assembly in Sion is the general assembly and Church of the firstborn,
the saints of God gathered from all nations: God appeared on Sinai as
the judge, ruler, and governor of one people; but the God of Sion is the
judge and governor of all who come there from all the various nations of
the earth: to those at Sinai the state of departed saints was
imperfectly known; but to those who are come to Sion their condition is
well known, they being a part of that body — the Church — of which
Christ is the head: the mediator at Sinai was Moses, a faithful servant,
and no more; but the Mediator of the New Covenant, which belongs to
Sion, *is* Jesus, by virtue of whose blood all sins are forgiven, and
all pollutions removed — a blood which pleads for mercy and not for
vengeance as the blood of Abel. All the parts of the first contrast are
not mentioned, but they may easily be gathered from the second.

<span id="xx.xliv-p5"></span>That the Church on earth is here meant by
Sion, seems very clear. The Church is often called the kingdom of
heaven, and its subjects are called the citizens of heaven. That angels
and saints departed are mentioned as those to whom we are come, is no
objection, because everything that belongs to Sion is seen only by
faith. Our connection with distant believers, living on the earth, is
maintained only by faith, exactly in the same manner as our connection
with angels or departed spirits. Whether the angels mentioned here are
ministering spirits, or the hosts above who serve God in heaven, it
makes no difference, as they are fellow­servants and fellow­citizens as
it were with all the family on earth. See <span
id="xx.xliv-p5.1"></span>[Col. 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#017)<span id="xx.xliv-p5.1"></span>. It
is the same company, though one is now on earth and the other in heaven;
they will finally be more closely united.

<span id="xx.xliv-p6"></span>To the notion that some, as *Macknight* and
others, have entertained, that Sion here means the Church in its
glorified state after the resurrection, there are insuperable
objections: the contrast in that case would not be suitable; for the
object of the Apostle is evidently to set forth the excellency of the
Gospel dispensation in comparison with that of the Law; no satisfactory
difference on such a supposition could be made between the Church of the
firstborn and the spirits of just men made perfect; the expression, “the
enrolled in heaven,” is more suitably applied to those on earth than to
those in glory; and there would be no propriety in that case in
mentioning Christ as the Mediator, or that his blood speaks a language
different from that of Abel.

<span id="xx.xlv"></span>

<span id="xx.xlv-p1"></span>APPENDIX Y 2

<span id="xx.xlv-p2"></span>**Chapter 12:27** *As* *of things that are
made, etc* The meaning of ὡς πεποιημένων*,* as given by *Doddridge,
Scott,* and *Stuart, is,* that they were things created, and therefore
perishable, appointed only for a time. *Macknight* considered the
expression elliptical for things “made with hands;” which denotes what
is of an imperfect nature. But the explanation of *Schleusner* is the
most natural and most suitable to the passage. He says that ποιέω means
sometimes to accomplish, to finish, to bring to an end. (<span
id="xx.xlv-p2.1"></span>[Rom. 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021),
[Rom. 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#028)<span
id="xx.xlv-p2.1"></span>; <span id="xx.xlv-p2.2"></span>[Eph
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#011)<span id="xx.xlv-p2.2"></span>;
<span id="xx.xlv-p2.3"></span>[1Th
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024)<span id="xx.xlv-p2.3"></span>.)
Then the rendering would be, “as of things to be completed,” or brought
to an end. They were things to be shaken or changed, as things to be
finished or terminated. The corresponding verb in Hebrew, <span
id="xx.xlv-p2.4"></span>עשה, has evidently this meaning, “all his works
which he had made,” (<span id="xx.xlv-p2.5"></span>עשה,) or completed,
or finished. (<span id="xx.xlv-p2.6"></span>[Ge
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002)<span id="xx.xlv-p2.6"></span>; see
<span id="xx.xlv-p2.7"></span>[Isa
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004)<span id="xx.xlv-p2.7"></span>.)

<span id="xx.xlvi"></span>

<span id="xx.xlvi-p1"></span>APPENDIX Z 2

<span id="xx.xlvi-p2"></span>**Chapter 12:28.** *let us have grace, etc*
So *Beza, Grotius, Doddridge,* and *Scott.* The *Vulg.* and *Calvin* are
no doubt wrong. The authority as to MSS. is altogether in favor of the
verb being in the imperative mood. *Macknight* gives this singular
rendering, “Let us hold fast a gift whereby we can worship God,” etc. He
explains the “gift” as denoting the dispensation of religion. No less
unsuitable is the version of *Stuart,* though countenanced by some of
the fathers, “Let us manifest gratitude (by which we may serve God
acceptably) with reverence and godly fear.” When “χάρις” means
gratitude, it is ever followed by a dative case, which is not the case
here. To have faith, ἔχειν πίστιν is to possess it, (<span
id="xx.xlvi-p2.1"></span>[Mt
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#020)<span id="xx.xlvi-p2.1"></span>;)
to have eternal life is to possess it, (<span
id="xx.xlvi-p2.2"></span>[Mt
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#016)<span id="xx.xlvi-p2.2"></span>;)
to have hope is to enjoy or possess it, (<span
id="xx.xlvi-p2.3"></span>[Ro 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004)<span
id="xx.xlvi-p2.3"></span>;) and so to have grace is to possess it. And
this alone comports with what follows; it is the possession of that by
which we may “serve God acceptably.” By “grace” we are to understand the
gracious help and assistance which God promises to all who seek it.

<span id="xx.xlvi-p3"></span>To receive a kingdom is to obtain a right
or a title to it; and having the promise of this kingdom we ought to
seek, attain, and possess that grace, that divine help, by which we may
in the meantime serve God acceptably. This is the obvious meaning of the
passage.

<span id="xx.xlvii"></span>

<span id="xx.xlvii-p1"></span>APPENDIX A 3

<span id="xx.xlvii-p2"></span>**Chapter 12:28.** *With reverence and
godly fear* The first word, αἰδως, means “modesty,” as rendered in <span
id="xx.xlvii-p2.1"></span>[1Ti
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009)<span id="xx.xlvii-p2.1"></span>,
and it is not found elsewhere in the New Testament. It has in the
classics the meaning of respect and reverence. The second word,
εὐλαθεία, properly means caution, circumspection, awfulness, and hence
dread and fear. It is found only here, and <span
id="xx.xlvii-p2.2"></span>[Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007)<span id="xx.xlvii-p2.2"></span>.
It occurs as a passive participle twice, in <span
id="xx.xlvii-p2.3"></span>[Ac
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#010)<span id="xx.xlvii-p2.3"></span>,
and in <span id="xx.xlvii-p2.4"></span>[Heb
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007)<span id="xx.xlvii-p2.4"></span>,
and means to be influenced or moved with fear. Neither “godly” nor
“religious” ought to be added to it.

<span id="xx.xlvii-p3"></span>It may seem difficult to reconcile this
“fear” or dread with that love, and confidence, and delight with which
God is to be served according to the evident testimony of Scripture,
especially of the New Testament. But were we to take the first word as
meaning “modesty,” (or humility,) as rendered by *Beza,* we might regard
the words as describing what we ought to feel in considering what we are
in ourselves, and what the danger is to which we are exposed. The
meaning then would be, that we are to serve God under a deep
consciousness of our own weakness, and under a fear or dread of the
danger of apostasy, though that dread may arise in part from an
apprehension of what God will be to apostates, according to what is said
in the following verse. Without these two feelings it is indeed
impossible for us in our present state to serve God acceptably; for
without humility arising from a sense of unworthiness and weakness, we
shall not be capable of appreciating his mercy; and without the dread of
sin, and especially of apostasy, we shall never depend as we ought on
God’s power to preserve us.

<span id="xx.xlvii-p4"></span>These feelings do not in the least degree
interfere with the exercise of love, gratitude, or confidence, but on
the contrary strengthen them. The weak shall be supported, but he must
feel his weakness; and those who dread sin (not God) shall be kept and
preserved; but they must feel this dread. And the more our weakness is
felt, the stronger we shall be, as Paul says, “When I am weak, then am I
strong;” and the more we fear and dread sin, the safer we shall be. But,
like Peter, we shall stumble and fall if we become self­confident and
exempt from the dread of sin.

<span id="xx.xlvii-p5"></span>No other meaning but that of fear or dread
belongs to εὐλαθεία, wherever found, either as a noun or a participle.
It is the fear of evil and not the fear of God. See the *Sept.,* in
<span id="xx.xlvii-p5.1"></span>[Jos
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#024)<span id="xx.xlvii-p5.1"></span>;
and <span id="xx.xlvii-p5.2"></span>[1 Macc.
3:30](../../../bib/apo/ma1003.htm#030)<span id="xx.xlvii-p5.2"></span>;
12:42. There is no place found where it denotes the fear of God.

<span id="xx.xlviii"></span>

<span id="xx.xlviii-p1"></span>APPENDIX B 3

<span id="xx.xlviii-p2"></span>**Chapter** **13:5** *let your
conversation, etc.* It is rendered by *Macknight* “behavior;” and by
S*tuart* “conduct.” But τρόπος; means not only way, manner, conduct, but
also a turn as it were of the mind, disposition, <span
id="xx.xlviii-p2.1"></span>*ing*e*nium,* as given by *Schleusner.
Parkhurst* quotes a passage from *Demosthenes,* in which it evidently
bears this sense. This version may then be given, “Let there be no
moneyloving disposition;” or, “Let your disposition be free from the
love of money.” The *Syr*. is, “Let not your heart love money.” The
*Vulg*. gives a loose version, “Let the conduct be without avarice.”
*Beza’s* is nearly the same. “Be content,” or “be satisfied, with what
you have;” that is, deem what you have sufficient or enough.

<span id="xx.xlix"></span>

<span id="xx.xlix-p1"></span>APPENDIX C 3

<span id="xx.xlix-p2"></span>**Chapter 13:5** *I will never leave thee,
etc* There are three places where these words with some variety are
found, <span id="xx.xlix-p2.1"></span>[De
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#006)<span id="xx.xlix-p2.1"></span>;
<span id="xx.xlix-p2.2"></span>[Jos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005)<span id="xx.xlix-p2.2"></span>;
<span id="xx.xlix-p2.3"></span>[1Ch
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#020)<span id="xx.xlix-p2.3"></span>.
In the first, they are the words of Moses to the people of Israel; in
the second, the words of God to Joshua; and in the third the words of
David to Solomon. The Hebrew in the three places is exactly the same,
excepting the change of person; but in none is the version of the
*Sept.* the same. The words, as here given, is literally the Hebrew in
<span id="xx.xlix-p2.4"></span>[Jos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005)<span id="xx.xlix-p2.4"></span>,
where the Greek version is wholly different; only the Apostle introduces
the treble negatives as found in that version in <span
id="xx.xlix-p2.5"></span>[De 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#006)<span
id="xx.xlix-p2.5"></span>, but not given in that version in either of
the two other instances. Then the quotation is from <span
id="xx.xlix-p2.6"></span>[Jos 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005)<span
id="xx.xlix-p2.6"></span>, except that the Apostle follows the *Sept.*
in <span id="xx.xlix-p2.7"></span>[De
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#006)<span id="xx.xlix-p2.7"></span>,
as to the three negatives.

<span id="xx.xlix-p3"></span>The Hebrew could not be rendered as to the
verbs more correctly than what is done by the Apostle, which are the
same in the *Sept.,* except in <span id="xx.xlix-p3.1"></span>[Jos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005)<span id="xx.xlix-p3.1"></span>.
The first verb means to relax, and in a transitive sense, to let go, to
dismiss, to give up, to surrender; and the second verb means to leave,
to forsake, to desert. The verbs in Greek bear a similar meaning. To
give a distinct sense to each, we may render the clause thus, —

<span id="xx.xlix-p4"></span>“I will not dismiss thee,  
Nor will I by any means desert thee.”

<span id="xx.xlix-p5"></span>That is, I will not give thee up so as to
separate myself from thee; nor will desert thee, no, by no means, when
thou art in difficulties and trials.

<span id="xx.xlix-p6"></span>The three negatives with the last verb are
remarkable. There is in Hebrew what somewhat corresponds with them. The
<span id="xx.xlix-p6.1"></span>ו when preceded by a negative may often
be rendered *and not, nor, neither.* Then the version would be this, “I
will not dismiss thee, nor will I, no, forsake thee.” It is indeed a
promise, that God will continue to be our God, so as not to give us up,
and that he will by no means forsake us in time of need.

<span id="xx.xlix-p7"></span>The quotation in the next verse is from
<span id="xx.xlix-p7.1"></span>[Ps
118:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#006)<span id="xx.xlix-p7.1"></span>,
and is literally the *Sept.* The Hebrew is somewhat different, “The Lord
is mine, and I will not fear; what can man do to me?” Then the next
verse shews that the Lord who was his was also a help to him, “The Lord,
mine, is my help, (literally, for my help;) and I shall look on my
haters;” a phrase which signifies that he should gain the victory over
them. The word “help” is borrowed by the *Sept.* from the seventh verse;
and as it was evidently the Apostle’s design to confirm the last clause
of the previous citation, “I will not forsake thee,” he deemed it
sufficient to quote the words of the *Sept.*

<span id="xx.l-p1"></span>APPENDIX D 3

<span id="xx.l-p2"></span>**Chapter 13:7** *Rule over you, etc*. The
word ἡγουμένοι means properly leaders, conductors, guides, such as lead
the way, and according to its secondary meaning, presidents, chiefs,
governors, rulers. It is rendered “prefects — <span
id="xx.l-p2.1"></span>praefectorum,” by the *Vulg*.; “leaders — <span
id="xx.l-p2.2"></span>ductorum,” by *Beza* and *Stuart;* and “rulers” by
*Macknight; Doddridge* paraphrases it, “Who have presided over you.” The
version most suitable to the context is “your leaders;” for they are
spoken of as persons to be followed; they were such as took the lead in
religion and were examples to others. But in verse 17 the idea of a
ruler is most suitable, for they were to be obeyed. The specific meaning
of a word which has various senses is ever to be ascertained from the
context. The leaders here referred to were those who had finished their
course; for they were *to remember* them, and not to observe their
conduct then as though they were living; and contemplating the end or
conclusion of their life, they were to follow their faith.

<span id="xx.l-p3"></span>The word ἔχθασις; means an outlet, a way of
escape, also the end, conclusion, or termination of a thing, or the
issue; and ἀναστροφὴ signifies manner of life, intercourse, behavior,
conduct, the way in which one lives. There is no English word that can
suitably express it. It may be rendered here “life,” — “and
contemplating the end of their life, follow their faith;” that *is,*
what they believed. They ended their life in peace, and were enabled to
triumph over all evils by means of the faith which they professed and
possessed.

<span id="xx.li"></span>

<span id="xx.li-p1"></span>APPENDIX E 3

<span id="xx.li-p2"></span>**Chapter 13:8** *Jesus Christ the same, etc*
The connection of this verse is differently viewed, and also its
meaning. Some connect it with the preceding verse thus, — “Jesus Christ
is even the same in power, grace, and faithfulness; he supported your
leaders and guides, who have completed their trials victoriously; he
being still the same will support you.” Such is the view taken by
*Grotius, Doddridge, Macknight, Scott,* and *Stuart.* Others, as
*Scholefield, Bloomfield,* and some German divines, connect the verse
with what follows in this sense, — “Jesus Christ is the same, therefore
be ye the same, and be not carried about by divers and strange
doctrines.”

<span id="xx.li-p3"></span>But there is no need of this exclusive
connection, as the verse appears connected with the preceding and the
following verse. Those who adopt the first view seem to be wrong as to
the main subject of the passage. What the Apostle exhorted the Hebrews
to do was to follow the *faith* of their leaders who were gone to rest,
and the contemplation of their happy and victorious end was introduced
for the purpose of encouragement in following their faith. And that this
is the particular and the chief point handled here is evident from the
ninth verse, where this doctrine is as it were applied, “Be ye not
carried about,” etc. Then the meaning of the whole passage may be given
thus, — “Follow the faith of your departed guides; there is no change in
it, Christ is ever the same in his mind, will, and purpose as to the
faith: suffer not, therefore, yourselves to be led astray by various and
strange doctrines, different from the faith of those who taught you and
have attained a happy end.” Thus the passage appears consistent
throughout and suitably connected, —

<span id="xx.li-p4"></span>**7.** Remember your leaders, who have spoken
to you the word of God, and contemplating the end of their life, follow
their

<span id="xx.li-p5"></span>**8.** faith: Jesus Christ, yesterday and
today, *is* the same, and

<span id="xx.li-p6"></span>**9.** *will be* for ever: Be not carried
about by various and strange (new) doctrines; for it is good that the
heart should be made firm by grace, not by meats, by which they have not
profited who have been so occupied.

<span id="xx.li-p7"></span>If the auxiliary verb be put in at all in the
eighth verse, it ought to be put in twice. But the words may be rendered
as a nominative case absolute, “Jesus Christ *being* the same yesterday,
and today, and for ever;” as though he had said, “I exhort you to follow
their faith, inasmuch as Jesus Christ, our teacher, mediator, and Savior
never changes, but is ever the same.”

<span id="xx.li-p8"></span>The MSS. are more in favor μὴ παραφέρεσθε,
“Be ye not carried away,” than of μὴ περιφέρεσθε, “Be ye not carried
about;” but as the latter verb is used on the same subject in <span
id="xx.li-p8.1"></span>[Eph 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014)<span
id="xx.li-p8.1"></span>, it is better to adopt it here: the difference
indeed is very trifling.

<span id="xx.li-p9"></span>The passage, as thus explained, bears
strongly against every innovation in the faith, in the doctrine of the
Gospel, Christ its teacher being ever the same. There are to be no
strange or new doctrines; for such is the meaning of strange here, that
is, what is alien to the Gospel, and therefore new. And what are all the
additions which have been made by the fathers, and especially by the
Church of Rome, but various doctrines, foreign to the Gospel, which ever
continues the same? Their variety is as great as their novelty. Christ
was, is, and will ever be the same as teacher, mediator, and Savior;
hence the faith, once delivered to the saints, must continue
unchangeably the same.

<span id="xx.lii"></span>

<span id="xx.lii-p1"></span>APPENDIX F 3

<span id="xx.lii-p2"></span>**Chapter 13:9.** *For it is a good thing,
etc* There seems to be some obscurity in the latter part of this verse,
and in the following verses. There appears, however, to be an intimation
of what the Apostle means in the term “strange” or new, as applied to
the doctrines here referred to. There was probably an attempt made to
unite some parts of the ceremonial law, especially the feasts, with the
Gospel. The distinction of meats was not new, but this kind of mixture
might have been so termed, that is, a participation in those sacrifices,
part of which was allowed to be eaten by those who presented them, <span
id="xx.lii-p2.1"></span>[Le
7:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#011)<span id="xx.lii-p2.1"></span>.
This was probably one of the strange or new doctrines. Such a compliance
must have been made for the sake of avoiding reproach and persecution.

<span id="xx.lii-p3"></span>The Apostle says in verse 10, that those who
did eat of the sacrifices could not be partakers of what Christians feed
on. Then in verse 11, he mentions the sacrifice made annually by the
high priest, no part of which was eaten, but the whole was burnt without
the camp, (referring to the state of things when the tabernacle was
erected in the wilderness,) intimating that the *chief* sacrifice was
not partaken of either by the priests or by the people. Taking this fact
as an intimation, and a symbol of what was to be, he says that Christ
had offered the great and the real sacrifice without the gate, (alluding
now to the temple at Jerusalem,) where we are to follow him, bearing the
reproach to which he was subjected; and we are not to return as it were
to the tabernacle, and to partake of such sacrifices as were there
eaten.

<span id="xx.lii-p4"></span>As an inducement to bear reproach, he
reminds them that life is but short, and that Christians expect their
home in another country; and at last he states what sacrifices they were
still to offer to God, not the sacrifices of peace­offerings, but those
of praise and thanksgiving, and also of good works.

<span id="xx.lii-p5"></span>The “meats” according to this view,
mentioned in verse 9, must have been the meats eaten when
free­will­offerings were presented. Admitting that the great sacrifice
for sin had been offered by Christ, some might have still supposed and
taught that such offerings as these were still allowed; and to eat of
such offerings might have been thought a very profitable thing,
calculated to produce a great benefit. In opposition to such a
sentiment, the Apostle may be supposed to have said, that it was good
that the heart should be strengthened by grace, not by meats, which did
not prove profitable to those who usually partook of them.

<span id="xx.lii-p6"></span>The “altar” is to be taken for the
sacrifices offered on it. He declares that it was not possible to
partake of the Christian’s food, and of the offerings made on the altar.
The literal rendering of the 11th and 12th verses is as follows, —

<span id="xx.lii-p7"></span>**11.** “Moreover, of the animals whose
blood for sin is brought into the holiest by the high priest, the bodies
of these are

<span id="xx.lii-p8"></span>**12.** burnt without the camp. Therefore
Jesus also, that he might make expiation for the people by his own
blood, suffered without the gate.”

<span id="xx.lii-p9"></span>The purpose for which these words seem to
have been added, was to shew that no eating, no meats, were connected
with the sacrifice for sin; and by saying in the following verse that we
are to follow Christ without the camp, bearing his reproach, the Apostle
intimates that this reproach ought not to be avoided by joining those in
the tabernacle, engaged in offering peace­offerings on which they
feasted.

<span id="xx.lii-p10"></span>The import of the whole passage, 9-16, may
be thus stated: — “Be not led away by various kinds of doctrines, and
such as are new; grace, and not eating of offerings, strengthens the
heart to enable it to maintain the faith and to endure trials; and this
grace, the meat that belongs to our altar, cannot be partaken of by
those who are still wedded to the altar of the earthly tabernacle. And
as to the annual sacrifice for sin, it is not eaten, but all burnt, not
in the tabernacle, but without the camp, — an intimation of what Christ
did when he suffered without the gate. Thither we must follow him, and
not return again to the tabernacle in order to avoid reproach; and this
reproach will not be long, for we are hastening to another world; and
instead of presenting free­will offerings and eating of them, what we
are to offer now are the sacrifices of praise, of thanksgiving, and of
good works.”

<span id="xx.liii"></span>

<span id="xx.liii-p1"></span>APPENDIX G 3

<span id="xx.liii-p2"></span>**Chapter 13:17** *That they may do it with
joy, etc.* There is a difference of opinion as to this sentence. Some,
as *Theophylact, Grotius,* and *Doddridge* refer “it,” or “this,” to
watching; others, as *Macknight, Scott,* and *Stuart,* apply “it” to the
account that is to be given by ministers. The first view, which *Calvin*
evidently takes, is alone consistent with the rest of the passage. The
concluding words of the verse are wholly inappropriate, if the account
at the day of judgment be considered as intended, but in every way
suitable when we regard watching as referred to. To say that an
unfavorable account at the last day would be “unprofitable” to the
people, would be to use an expression in no way congruous; but to
represent the watching of ministers, when rendered “grievous” by the
perverseness and refractory conduct of the people, as unprofitable to
the people themselves, is altogether appropriate; and it is a very
important consideration, and affords a strong argument in favor of
obedience. The people by insubordination, not only grieve those who
watch over them, but also injure themselves, prevent their own
improvement, and render the watching care of their ministers useless.
Reference is made by *Macknight* to <span id="xx.liii-p2.1"></span>[1Th
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019)<span id="xx.liii-p2.1"></span>;
but “joy” only is mentioned there; and *Doddridge* justly observes, “It
is not possible for any perverseness of the people to prevent a faithful
minister from giving up his account with joy; nor can any *groans* be
mingled with the triumphant songs which God will put into the mouths of
all his people.” No doubt the “grief” here mentioned shews clearly the
meaning of the passage.

<span id="xx.liv"></span>

<span id="xx.liv-p1"></span>APPENDIX H 3

<span id="xx.liv-p2"></span>**Chapter 13:20** *Through the blood of the
covenant, etc* The *Vul*g*.,* our version, *Calvin,* and *Scott,*
connect the words with “bringing again from the dead;” only the *Vulg*.
and *Calvin* render the preposition *in,* and our version and *Scott,
through.* The idea conveyed by *in* is explained by *Calvin,* and the
same is given by *Theodoret,* and what is meant by *through* is thus
explained by *Scott,* — “In order to shew that his ransom was accepted,
and that he might perform his gracious work as the great Shepherd of the
sheep, God the Father had raised him from the dead ‘through the blood of
the everlasting covenant.’”

<span id="xx.liv-p3"></span>Others, as *Beza, Doddridge* and *Stuart,*
connect the words with “the great Shepherd,” that is, that Christ became
the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of an everlasting
covenant; and <span id="xx.liv-p3.1"></span>[Ac
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028)<span id="xx.liv-p3.1"></span>*,*
and <span id="xx.liv-p3.2"></span>[Joh
10:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011)<span
id="xx.liv-p3.2"></span>, have been referred to as favorable to this
view. *Stuart’s* version is the following, —

<span id="xx.liv-p4"></span>**20.** “Now may the God of peace, that
raised from the dead our Lord Jesus, (who by the blood of an everlasting
covenant

<span id="xx.liv-p5"></span>**21**. has become the great Shepherd of the
sheep,) prepare you for every good work, that ye may do his will;
working in you that which is well­pleasing in his sight, through Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever.”

<span id="xx.liv-p6"></span>But a more literal rendering may be given
thus, —

<span id="xx.liv-p7"></span>**20.** “Now the God of peace, who has
restored from the dead the Shepherd of the sheep (the chief through the
blood of

<span id="xx.liv-p8"></span>**21.** the everlasting covenant) our Lord
Jesus, — may he fit you for every good work to do his will, forming in
you what is well­pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ, to whom be
glory for ever and ever.”

<span id="xx.liv-p9"></span>The word μέγας great, means sometimes
“chief,” <span id="xx.liv-p9.1"></span>*summus,* as given by
*Schleusner;* and it has this meaning in <span
id="xx.liv-p9.2"></span>[Heb 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014)<span
id="xx.liv-p9.2"></span>. In <span id="xx.liv-p9.3"></span>[Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011)<span id="xx.liv-p9.3"></span>,
etc., our Savior refers to his death, the shedding of his blood, as an
evidence that he was *the* good Shepherd. It may then be rightly said,
that he became the chief by or through the blood of the everlasting
covenant, that is, through the blood that sealed and rendered effectual
a covenant that is permanent, and not temporary like that of Moses.

<span id="xx.liv-p10"></span>His prayer was that God would fit, adapt,
or prepare them for every good work; and this he afterwards explains,
“forming,” producing, or creating “in you,” etc.; for the verb, ποιέω,
to make, is often used in this sense. He means an internal influence or
operation, as expressed more fully in <span
id="xx.liv-p10.1"></span>[Php
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013)<span id="xx.liv-p10.1"></span>,
“For it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do (literally, to
work) of his good pleasure.” And this forming or creating in them what
was pleasing in his sight was to be done through Jesus Christ, through
him as a Mediator, he having become the chief Shepherd of the sheep by
shedding his blood for them.
