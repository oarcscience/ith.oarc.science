<p><a name="ix.i-p2"></A><b>1.</b> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ix.i-p3"></A><b>1.</b> Unde fratres sancti vocationis coelestis participes, considerate Apostolum et sacerdotem confessionis nostrae, Christum Iesum;</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ix.i-p4"></A><b>2.</b> Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses <i>was faithful</i> in all his house.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ix.i-p5"></A><b>2.</b> Qui fidelis est ei qui constituit eum, quemadmodum et Moses in Tota domo ejus.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ix.i-p6"></A><b>3.</b> For this <i>man</i> was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honor than the house.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ix.i-p7"></A><b>3.</b> Majore quippe gloria hic dignus habitus est quam Moses, quanto majorem habet honorem architectus domus quam ipsa.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ix.i-p8"></A><b>4.</b> For every house is builded by some <i>man</i>; but he that built all things <i>is</i> God.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ix.i-p9"></A><b>4.</b> Omnis enim domus construitur ab aliquo, qui autem omnia construxit Deus est.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ix.i-p10"></A><b>5.</b> And Moses verily <i>was</i> faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ix.i-p11"></A><b>5.</b> Et Moses quidem fidelis in tota domo ejus tanquam minister in testimonium eorum quae post dicenda erant;</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ix.i-p12"></A><b>6.</b> But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ix.i-p13"></A><b>6.</b> Christus autem tanquam filius supra domum ipsius; cujus nos domus sumus, si fiduciam et gloriationem spei ad finem usque firmam tenuerimus.</p>

<p><a name="ix.i-p16"></A><b>1.</b> <i>Wherefore, holy brethren,</i> <i>etc.</i> He concludes the preceding doctrine with a necessary exhortation, that the Jews should attentively consider what sort of being and how great Christ is. As he had before, by naming him a teacher and a priest, briefly compared him with Moses and Aaron, so he now includes 			 both clauses; for he adorns him with two titles, as he sustains a twofold character in the Church of God. Moses was a prophet and a teacher, and Aaron was a priest; but the two offices belong to Christ. If then we seek rightly to know him, we must inquire what sort of being he is; yea, he must be clothed with his own power, lest we lay hold on an empty shadow and not on him.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">53</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p18"></A>First, the word <i>consider,</i> is important, for it intimates that singular attention is required, as he cannot be disregarded with impunity, and that at the same time the true knowledge of Christ is sufficient to dissipate the darkness of all errors. And to encourage them the more to pursue this study, he reminds them of their <i>calling</i>; as though he had said, &#8220;God favored you with no common grace when He called you into his kingdom;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">54</FONT></A>
 			  it now remains that you have your eyes fixed on Christ as your leader in the way.&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">55</FONT></A>
 			  For the calling of the godly cannot be otherwise confirmed than by a thorough surrender of themselves to Christ. We ought not therefore to regard this as said only to the Jews, but that it is a general truth addressed to all who desire to come into the kingdom of God; they ought sedulously to attend to Christ, for he is the sole instructor of our faith, and has confirmed it by the sacrifice of himself; for <i>confession,</i> or profession, is to be taken here for faith, as thought he had said, that the faith we profess is vain and of no avail, unless Christ be its object.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">56</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p23"></A><a name="ix.i-p23.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p24"></A><b>2.</b> <i>Who was,</i> or <i>is</i> <i>faithful,</i> <i>etc.</i> This is a commendation of the apostleship of Christ, in order that the faithful may securely acquiesce in him; and he commends it on two grounds, because the Father has set 			 him to be over us as our teacher, and because Christ himself has faithfully performed the office committed to him. These two things are always necessary to secure authority to a doctrine; for God alone ought to be attended to, as the whole Scripture testifies; hence Christ declares, that the doctrine which he delivered was not his own, but the Father&#8217;s, (<a name="ix.i-p24.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#016">Joh 7:16</a><a name="ix.i-p24.1"></A>;) and in another place he 			 says, &#8220;He who received me, receiveth him who has sent me.&#8221; (<a name="ix.i-p24.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#048">Lu 9:48</a><a name="ix.i-p24.2"></A>.) For we say of Christ, that as he is clothed with our flesh, he is the Father&#8217;s minister to execute his commands. To the calling of God is added the faithful and upright performance of duty on the part of Christ; and this is required in true ministers, in order that they may obtain credence in the Church. Since these two 			 things are found in Christ, doubtless he cannot be disregarded without despising God in him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p25"></A><i>As also Moses,</i> <i>etc.</i> Omitting for a while the priesthood, he speaks here of his apostleship. For as there are two parts in God&#8217;s covenant, the promulgation of the truth, and so to speak, its real confirmation, the full perfection of the covenant would not appear in Christ, were not both parts found in him. Hence the writer of the epistle, after having 			 mentioned both, roused attention by a brief exhortation. But he now enters on a longer discussion, and begins with the office of a teacher: he therefore now compares Christ only with Moses. The words, <i>in all his house,</i> may be applied to Moses; but I prefer to apply them to Christ, as he may be said to be faithful to his Father in ruling his whole house. It hence follows, that none belong to the Church of God except those who acknowledge Christ. 			   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">57</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p28"></A><a name="ix.i-p28.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p29"></A><b>3.</b> <i>For this man </i>(or, <i>he</i>) <i>was counted worthy,</i> <i>etc.</i> Lest he might appear to make Moses equal to Christ, he reminds us of his superior excellency; and this he proves by two arguments, &shy;Moses so ruled the 			 Church, that he was still a part and member of it; but Christ being the builder, is superior to the whole building, &#8212; Moses while ruling others, was ruled also himself, as he was a servant; but Christ being a Son possesses supreme power.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p30"></A>It is a frequent and well&shy;known metaphor used in Scripture to call the Church the house of God. (<a name="ix.i-p30.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015">1Ti 3:15</a><a name="ix.i-p30.1"></A>.) And as it is composed of the faithful, each of them is called a living stone. (<a name="ix.i-p30.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005">1Pe 2:5</a><a name="ix.i-p30.2"></A>.) They are also sometimes called the vessels with which the house is 			 furnished. (<a name="ix.i-p30.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#020">2Ti 2:20</a><a name="ix.i-p30.3"></A>.) There is then no one so eminent that he is not a member, and included in the universal body. God being the builder, alone is to be set above his own work; but God dwells in Christ, so that whatever is said of God is applicable to him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p31"></A>If any one objects and says that Christ is also a part of the building because he is the foundation, because he is our brother, because he has a union with us and then that he is not the master&shy;builder because he himself was formed by God: in reply to these things we say that our faith is so founded on him that he still rules over us that he is in such a way our brother that he is yet our Lord, that he was so formed by God as man that he 			 nevertheless by his Spirit revives and restores all things as the eternal God. The Scripture employs us various metaphors to set forth Christ s grace towards us; but there is no one which derogates from his honor mentioned here by the Apostle; for what is stated here is that all ought to be brought down to their own state because they ought to be in subjection to the head and that Christ alone is exempt from this submission, because he is the head.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p32"></A>If it be again objected and said that Moses was no less a master&shy;builder than Paul who gloried in this title: to this I reply that this name is applied to prophets and teachers but not with strict correctness; for they are only the instruments and indeed dead instruments, except the Lord from heaven gives efficacy to what they do; and then they so labor in building the Church, that they themselves form a part of the structure; but the case 			 is wholly different as to Christ, for he ever builds up the Church by the power of his own Spirit. Besides, he stands far above the rest, for he is in such a way the true temple of God, that he is at the same time the God who inhabits it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p33"></A><a name="ix.i-p33.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p34"></A><b>4.</b> <i>He that built,</i> <i>etc.</i> Though these words may be extended to the creation of the whole world, yet I confine them to the present subject. We are then to understand that nothing is done in the Church which ought not to he ascribed to Gods power; for he alone has founded it by his own hand, 			 (<a name="ix.i-p34.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005">Ps 87:5</a><a name="ix.i-p34.1"></A>;) and Paul says of Christ that he is the head, from whom the whole body, joined together and connected by every subservient juncture, makes an increase according to what is done proportionally by every member. (<a name="ix.i-p34.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016">Eph 4:16</a><a name="ix.i-p34.2"></A>.) Hence he often declares that the success of 			 his ministry was God&#8217;s work. In a word, if we take a right view of things, it will appear that how much soever God may use the labors of men in building his Church, yet he himself performs everything &#8212; the instrument derogates nothing from the workman.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">58</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p36"></A><a name="ix.i-p36.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p37"></A><b>5.</b> <i>And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant,</i> <i>etc.</i> The second difference is, that to Moses was committed a doctrine to which he, in common with others, was to submit; but Christ, though he put on the form of a servant, is yet Master and Lord, to whom all ought to be subject; for, as we 			 found in <a name="ix.i-p37.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002">Heb 1:2</a><a name="ix.i-p37.1"></A>, he is constituted heir of all things.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p38"></A><i>For a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after,</i> or <i>which were afterwards to be said</i> or <i>declared</i>. I explain this simply in this way, &#8212; that Moses, while a herald of that doctrine which was to be published for a time to the ancient people, did at the same time render a testimony to the 			 Gospel, the publication of which was not as yet to be made; for it is doubtless evident, that the end and completion of the Law is that perfection of wisdom contained in the Gospel. This exposition seems to comport with the future tense of the participle. The meaning indeed is, that Moses faithfully delivered to the people what the Lord had committed to him, but that limits were prescribed to him which it was not lawful for him to pass. God formerly spoke at different times and in various ways 			 by the prophets, but he deferred to the fullness of time the complete revelation of the Gospel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p39"></A><a name="ix.i-p39.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p40"></A><b>6.</b> <i>Whose house are we,</i> <i>etc.</i> As Paul in his Epistle to the Romans, after having prefaced that he was appointed to be the Apostle of the Gentiles, adds, for the sake of gaining credit among them, that they were of that number; so now the author of this epistle exhorts the Jews who had already made a 			 profession of Christ to persevere in the faith, that they might be deemed as being in Gods household. He had said before that God&#8217;s house was subject to the authority of Christ. Suitably to this declaration is added the admonition that they would then have a place in God&#8217;s family when they obeyed Christ. But as they had already embraced the gospel, he mentions their condition if they persevered in the faith. For the word <i>hope</i> I take for faith; 			 and indeed hope is nothing else but the constancy of faith. He mentions <i>confidence</i> and <i>rejoicing,</i> or glorying, in order to express more fully the power of faith.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_58"><FONT SIZE="1">59</FONT></A>
 			  And we hence conclude that those who assent to the Gospel doubtfully and like those who vacillate, do not truly and really believe; for faith cannot be without a settled peace of mind, from which proceeds the bold confidence of rejoicing. And so these two things, confidence and rejoicing, are ever the effects of faith, as we stated in explaining Romans the 5th chapter, and Ephesians the 3rd chapter</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p44"></A>But to these things the whole teaching of the Papists is opposed; and this very fact, were there nothing else, sufficiently proves that they pull down the Church of God rather than build it. For the certainty by which alone we are made, as the Apostle teaches us, holy temples to God, they not only darken by their glosses, but also condemn as presumption. Besides, what firmness of confidence can there be when men know not what they ought to 			 believe? And yet that monstrous thing, implicit faith, which they have invented, is nothing else than a license to entertain errors. This passage reminds us that we are always to make progress even unto death; for our whole life is as it were a race.</p>  <a name="ix.ii"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption21"><a name="ix.ii-p1"></A>Hebrews Chapter 3:7-13</p>

<p><a name="ix.ii-p12"></A><b>12.</b> Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</p>

<p><a name="ix.ii-p17"></A><a name="ix.ii-p17.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p18"></A>He proceeds in his exhortation, that they were to obey Christ speaking to them; and that he might add more weight to it, he confirms it by the testimony of David; for since they were to be sharply goaded, it was better, for the sake of avoiding offense, to bring forward another person. Had he simply reproached them for the unbelief of the fathers, they would have less favorably attended to him; but when he brought forward David, it was less 			 offensive. Now, the import of the whole is, &#8212; As God from the beginning would his voice obeyed, and could not endure perverseness without punishing it severely, so at this day he will not lightly punish our stubbornness, unless we become teachable. But the discourse is suspended until we come to the words, &#8220;Take heed, brethren, lest there be at any time in any of you,&#8221; <i>etc.</i> That the passage, then, may flow better, it would be proper to include the rest in a parenthesis.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_59"><FONT SIZE="1">60</FONT></A>
 			 Let us now consider the words in order.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p20"></A><b>7.</b> <i>As the Holy Ghost saith,</i> <i>etc.</i> This availed much more to touch their hearts than if he had quoted David by name. And it is useful for us to familiarize ourselves with such expressions, so that we may remember that the words adduced from the books of the prophets are those of God and not of 			 men.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p21"></A>But as this sentence<i>, Today, if ye will hear his voice,</i> is a part of a former verse, some have not unsuitably rendered it thus, &#8220;Would to God you would this day hear his voice.&#8221; It is indeed certain that when David called the Jews God&#8217;s people, he immediately drew this conclusion, that the voice of God ought to have been heard by them; for as to those whom he there invited to 			 sing praises to God and to celebrate his goodness, he reminded them at the same time that obedience was the chief worship which he required, and that it was better than all sacrifices. The chief thing, then, was to obey the word of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p22"></A><a name="ix.ii-p22.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p23"></A><b>8. </b>Then follows<a name="ix.ii-p23.1"></A>, <i>Harden not your hearts</i>  By which words is intimated that our rebellion against God flows from no other fountain than willful wickedness, by which we obstruct the entrance of his grace, We have indeed by nature a 			 heart of stone, and there is in all an innate hardness from the womb, which God alone can mollify and amend. That we, however, reject the voice of God, it happens through a spontaneous obstinacy, not through an external impulse, a fact of which every one is a witness to himself. Rightly, then, does the Spirit accuse all the unbelieving that they resist God, and that they are the teachers and authors of their own perverseness, so that they can throw the blame on none else. It is hence, however, 			 absurdly concluded that we have, on the other hand, a free power to form the heart for God&#8217;s service; nay rather, it must ever be the case with men, that they harden their heart until another be given them from heaven; for as we are bent towards wickedness, we shall never cease to resist God until we shall be tamed and subdued by his hand.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p24"></A><i>As in the provocation,</i> <i>etc.</i> It was for two reasons necessary for them to be reminded of the disobedience of their fathers; for as they were foolishly inflated on account of the glory of their race, they often imitated the vices of their fathers as though they were virtues, and defended themselves by their examples; and further, when they heard that 			 their fathers were so disobedient to God, they were thus more fully taught that this admonition was not superfluous. As both these reasons existed even in the Apostle&#8217;s time, he readily accommodated to his own purpose what had been formerly said by David, in order that those whom he addressed might not imitate their fathers too much.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p25"></A>And hence may be learnt a general truth, that we are not to defer too much to the authority of the fathers lest it should draw us away from God; for if any fathers have ever been worthy of honor, no doubt the Jews possessed that preeminence; and yet David distinctly commanded their children to beware of being like them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p26"></A>And I have no doubt but that he referred to the history recorded in <a name="ix.ii-p26.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001">Ex 17:1-7</a><a name="ix.ii-p26.1"></A>: for David uses here the two names which Moses relates were given to a certain place, <a name="ix.ii-p26.2"></A>&#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; Meribah, which means strife or provocation, 			 and <a name="ix.ii-p26.3"></A>&#1502;&#1505;&#1492; Massah, which means temptation. They tempted God by denying that he was in the midst of them, because they were distressed for want of water; and they also provoked him by contending with Moses. Though indeed they gave many examples of unbelief, yet David selected this in an especial manner, because it was more memorable then any other, and also, because in order of time it followed 			 for the most part the rest, as it evidently appears from the fourth book of Moses, where from chap. 10 to 20 a series of many temptations is described; but this narrative is given in the twentieth chapter. This circumstance increased not a little the atrocity of their wickedness; for they had often experienced the power of God, and yet they perversely contended with him, and renounced all confidence in him: how great was their ingratitude! He then mentioned one particular instance instead of 			 many.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p27"></A><a name="ix.ii-p27.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p28"></A><b>9.</b> <i>Tempted,</i> <i>etc.</i> This word is to be taken in a bad sense; it means to provoke in a proud and insulting manner, which we express in French by saying, <a name="ix.ii-p28.1"></A><i>defier comme en depitant</i>  For though God had often brought them help, yet they forgot all, and scornfully asked, where was his power. <i>Proved,</i> <i>etc.</i> This clause is to be thus explained, &#8220;When yet they had proved me and seen my works&#8221;. For it enhanced the guilt of their impiety, that having been taught by so many evidences of divine power, they had made so bad a progress. For it was a marvelous supineness and 			 stupidity to esteem God&#8217;s power as nothing, which had been so fully proved.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p30"></A><i>Forty years.</i> These are connected by David with what follows. But we know that the Apostles in quoting passages attend more to the general meaning than to the words. And no doubt God complained that the people had been vexatious to him for forty years, because so many benefits had availed nothing for the purpose of teaching them; for though God did good continually to them who were wholly unworthy, 			 they yet never ceased to rise up against him.

But their right to a sure possession was founded on what God said to Abraham,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ix.ii-p35"></A>&#8220;To thy seed will I give this land.&#8221; (<a name="ix.ii-p35.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007">Ge 12:7</a><a name="ix.ii-p35.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p36"></A>By God swearing, <i>If they shall enter,</i> <i>etc.</i>, the atrocity of their evil conduct is made more evident and is more forcibly set forth, for it is an evidence of wrath greatly inflamed. &#8220;If they shall enter,&#8221; is in the form of an oath, in which something is to be understood, as an imprecation, or some such thing, when men speak; but 			 when God speaks, it is the same as though he said, &#8220;Let me not be deemed true,&#8221;, or, &#8220;Let me not be hereafter believed, if such a thing shall not be so.&#8221; However, this defective mode of speaking recommends fear and reverence to us, so that we may not rashly swear, as many do, who are often in the habit of pouring forth dreadful curses.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p37"></A>But as to the present passage, we ought not to think that they were then for the first time denied entrance into the land by God&#8217;s oath, when they tempted him in Rephidim; for they had long before been excluded, even from the time they had refused to march forward at the report of the spies. God then does not here ascribe their expulsion from the land to this instance of tempting him as to the first cause; but he intimates that by no 			 chastisement could they have been restored to a sound mind, but that they continually added new offenses: and thus he shows that they fully deserved to be thus severely punished, for they never ceased to increase more and more his wrath by various sins, as though he had said, &#8220;This is the generation to which I denied the possession of the promised land, for during whole forty years afterwards it betrayed its obstinate madness by innumerable sins.&#8221;</p>

Unless our faith be now and then raised up, it will lie prostrate; unless it be warmed, it will be frozen; unless it be 			 roused, it will grow torpid. He would have us then to stimulate one another by mutual exhortations, so that Satan may not creep into our hearts, and by his fallacies draw us away from God. And this is a way of speaking that ought to be especially observed; for we fall not immediately by the first assault into this madness of striving against God; but Satan by degrees accosts us artfully by indirect means, until he holds us ensnared in his delusions. Then indeed being blinded, we break forth 			 into open rebellion.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">63</FONT></A>

<p><a name="ix.ii-p45"></A>We must then meet this danger in due time, and it is one that is nigh us all, for nothing is more possible than to be deceived; and from this deception comes at length hardness of heart. We hence see how necessary it is for us to be roused by the incessant goads of exhortations. Nor does the Apostle give only a general precept, that all should take heed to themselves, but he should have them also to be solicitous for the salvation of every 			 member, so that they should not suffer any of those who had been once called to perish through their neglect, and he who feels it his duty so to watch over the salvation of the whole flock as to neglect no one sheep, performs in this case the office of a good shepherd.</p>

As often, then, and as long as he opened his sacred mouth to teach us, let this 			 sentence come to our minds, &#8220;Today, if ye will hear his voice&#8221;. In the same way Paul teaches us that when the Gospel is preached to us, it is the accepted time in which God hears us, and the Day of salvation in which he helps us.

In a word, too late will be their groans who despise the grace offered to them today. As, then, we know 			 not whether God will extend his calling to tomorrow, let us not delay. Today he calls us; let us immediately respond to him, for there is no faith except where there is such a readiness to obey.</p>  <a name="ix.iii"></A>

<p><a name="ix.iii-p16"></A><b>14.</b> <i>For we are made partakers,</i> <i>etc.</i> He commends them for having begun well; but lest, under the pretext of the grace which they had obtained, they should indulge themselves in carnal security, he says that there was need of perseverance; for many having only tasted the Gospel, do not think of any 			 progress as though they had reached the summit. Thus it is that they not only stop in the middle of their race, yea, nigh the starting&shy;posts, but turn another way. Plausible indeed is this objection, &#8220;What can we wish more after having found Christ?&#8221; But if he is possessed by faith, we must persevere in it, so that he may be our perpetual possession. Christ then has given himself to be enjoyed by us on this condition, that by the same faith by which we have been admitted into a 			 participation of him, we are to preserve so great a blessing even to death.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A>

<p><a name="ix.iii-p18"></A>Hence he says <i>beginning,</i> intimating that their faith was only begun. As <i>hypostasis</i> sometimes means <i>confidence,</i> it may be so taken here; yet the term <i>substance,</i> as some have rendered it, I do not dislike, though I explain it in a 			 way somewhat different. They think that faith is thus called, because the whole of what man may have without it is nothing but vanity; but I so regard it, because we recumb on it alone, as there is no other support on which we can rely. And suitable to this view is the word <i>steadfast</i> or firm; for we shall be firmly fixed and beyond the danger of vacillating, provided faith be our foundation. The sum of the whole then is, that faith whose 			 beginnings only appear in us, is to make constant and steady progress to the end.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_64"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A>

For since faith responds to the preaching of the Gospel, as preaching continues through the whole course of our life, so we ought to continue growing in faith. The 			 phrase, then, <i>while it is said,</i> is the same as though he had said, &#8220;Since God never makes an end of speaking, it is not enough for us readily to receive his doctrine, except we exhibit the same teachableness and obedience tomorrow and every following day.&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_65"></A><A HREF="#fn_65"><FONT SIZE="1">66</FONT></A>

<p><a name="ix.iii-p26"></A><b>16</b> <i> For some, when they had heard,</i> <i>etc.</i> David spoke of the fathers as though that whole generation were unbelieving; but it appears that some who truly feared God mingled with the wicked. The apostle mentions this to modify what had been more severely said by David, in order that we may know that the 			 word is preached to all for this end, that all may obey it with one consent, and that the whole people were justly condemned for unbelief, when the body was torn and mutilated by the defection of the greatest part.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p27"></A>But by saying that some <i>provoked,</i> while yet they were by far the greatest part, this object was not only to avoid giving offense, but also to encourage the Jews to imitate those who believed; as though he had said, &#8220;As God forbids you to follow the unbelief of the fathers, so he sets before you other fathers whose faith is to be your example&#8221;. Thus is mitigated what otherwise 			 might have appeared too hard; that is, had they been commanded wholly to dissent from their fathers. <i>To come out by Moses,</i> means by the hand of Moses, for he was the minister of their deliverance. But there is an implied comparison between the benefit which God had bestowed on them by Moses, and the participation of Christ previously mentioned.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p28"></A><a name="ix.iii-p28.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p29"></A><b>17.</b> <i>But with whom was he grieved,</i> or <i>angry, etc.</i> He means that God had never been angry with his people except for just causes, as Paul also reminds us in <a name="ix.iii-p29.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#005">1 Cor. 10:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#006">6</a><a name="ix.iii-p29.1"></A>. Therefore as many chastisements of God as we read were inflicted on the ancient people, so many grievous sins shall we find which provoked God&#8217;s vengeance. At the same time we must come to this conclusion, that unbelief was the chief of all their evils; for though he mentions this the last, he yet means that it was the primary cause of their curse; and no doubt from the time they once became unbelievers, they never ceased to add one sin to another, and thus they 			 brought on themselves new scourges continually. Hence those very persons who through unbelief rejected the possession of the land offered to them, pursued their own obstinacy, now lusting, then murmuring, now committing adultery, then polluting themselves with heathen superstitions, so that their depravity became more fully manifested.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p30"></A>The unbelief, then, which they showed from the beginning, prevented them from enjoying the kindness of God; for the contempt of his word ever led them to sin. And as at first they deserved through their unbelief that God should deprive them of the promised rest, so whatever sin they committed afterwards flowed from the same fountain.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p31"></A>It may be further asked, whether Moses, and Aaron, and those like them, were included in this number? To this I answer, that the Apostle speaks of the whole community rather than of individuals. It is certain that there were many godly men who were either not entangled in the general impiety or soon repented. Moses&#8217; faith was once shaken and only once, and that for a moment. The Apostle&#8217;s words, therefore, contain a statement of the whole 			 instead of a part, a mode of speaking frequently employed when a multitude or body of people are spoken of.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.ii-p44"></A>  &#8220;Deceitfulness of sin&#8221; is rendered by Stuart &#8220;sinful delusion.&#8221; It ought rather to be &#8220;deceitful (or seductive) sin&#8221; as &#8220;deceitfulness of riches&#8221; in <a name="ix.ii-p44.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#022">Mt 13:22</a><a name="ix.ii-p44.2"></A>, means &#8220;deceitful riches.&#8221; The &#8220;sin&#8221; was evidently that of apostasy: and it was deceitful, because there was a present prospect of relief from troubles and persecutions. The power 				  of any sin to deceive and seduce, consists in some present gratification or interest. See note on verse 6. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.iii-p17"></A> What is implied here is that we may professedly be partakers of Christ: that is of his blessings as a Savior, and yet be not really so: the proof of the reality is perseverance. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.iii-p19"></A> Here is another instance of the genitive being the main subject, &#8220;the beginning of our confidence,&#8221; i.e., our first confidence, which the Apostle calls &#8220;first faith&#8221; in <a name="ix.iii-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#012">1Ti 5:12</a><a name="ix.iii-p19.1"></A>. Macknight renders it &#8220;the begun confidence.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.iii-p22"></A> Most connect this verse with the preceding, as in our version, and as Doddridge thus &#8220;forasmuch as it is said;&#8221; and Macknight thus &#8220;as ye may know by the saying.&#8221; So does Beza; and Calvin seems to do the same; but some connect it with the 13th and others with the 14th verse. Modern authors, such as Stuart and Blooomfield, regard it as the commencement of a paragraph, and connect it with what 				  follows. Stuart&#8217;s version is &#8212;</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.iii-p23"></A>15. With regard to the saying, &#8220;today while ye hear his voice, harden<br> 				  16. Not your hearts as in the provocation;&#8221; who now were they that when they heard did provoke? Nay, did not all who came out of Egypt under Moses? Etc.</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.iii-p24"></A>Bloomfield approves of this version, only he considers the quotation is confined to the words, &#8220;Today, while ye hear his voice,&#8221; and regards what follows, &#8220;harden not,&#8221; etc., as said by the writer: See Appendix N. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>
