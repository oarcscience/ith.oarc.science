<p><a name="xvii.i-p2"></A><b>1.</b> Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</p>

<p><a name="xvii.i-p5"></A><a name="xvii.i-p5.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p6"></A><b>1.</b> <i>Now faith,</i> <i>etc.</i> Whoever made this the beginning of the eleventh chapter, has unwisely disjointed the context; for the object of the Apostle was to prove what he had already said &shy;that there is need of patience.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_199"></A><A HREF="#fn_199"><FONT SIZE="1">200</FONT></A>
 			  He had quoted the testimony of Habakkuk, who says that the just lives by faith; he now shows what remained to be proved &#8212; that faith can be no more separated from patience than from itself. The order then of what he says is this, &#8212; &#8220;We shall not reach the goal of salvation except we have patience, for the Prophet declares that the just lives by faith; but faith directs us to things afar off which we do not as yet enjoy; it then necessarily includes patience.&#8221; 			 Therefore the minor proposition in the argument is this, <i>Faith is the substance of things hoped for,</i> <i>etc.</i> It is hence also evident, that greatly mistaken are they who think that an exact definition of faith is given here; for the Apostle does not speak here of the whole of what faith is, but selects that part of it which was suitable to his purpose, even that it has patience ever connected with 			 it.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_200"></A><A HREF="#fn_200"><FONT SIZE="1">201</FONT></A>
 			  Let us now consider the words.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p9"></A>He calls faith the <i>hypostasis,</i> the substance of things hoped for. We indeed know that what we hope for is not what we have as it were in hand, but what is as yet hid from us, or at least the enjoyment of which is delayed to another time. The Apostle now teaches us the same thing with what we find in <a name="xvii.i-p9.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024">Ro 8:24</a><a name="xvii.i-p9.1"></A>; where it is said that what is hoped for is not seen, and hence the inference is drawn, that it is to be waited for in patience. So the Apostle here reminds us, that faith regards not present things, but such as are waited for. Nor is this kind of contradiction without its force and beauty: Faith, he says, is the hypostasis, the prop, or the foundation on which we plant our foot, &#8212; the prop of what? Of things absent, which are so far 			 from being really possessed by us, that they are far beyond the reach of our understanding.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p10"></A>The same view is to be taken of the second clause, when he calls faith the <i>evidence</i> or demonstration of things <i>not seen;</i> for demonstration makes things to appear or to be seen; and it is commonly applied to what is subject to our senses.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_201"></A><A HREF="#fn_201"><FONT SIZE="1">202</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p14"></A>Then these two things, though apparently inconsistent, do yet perfectly harmonize when we speak of faith; for the Spirit of God shows to us hidden things, the knowledge of which cannot reach our senses: Promised to us is eternal life, but it is promised to the dead; we are assured of a happy resurrection, but we are as yet involved in corruption; we are pronounced just, as yet sin dwells in us; we hear that we are happy, but 			 we are as yet in the midst of many miseries; an abundance of all good things is promised to us, but still we often hunger and thirst; God proclaims that he will come quickly, but he seems deaf when we cry to him. What would become of us were we not supported by hope, and did not our minds emerge out of the midst of darkness above the world through the light of God&#8217;s word and of his Spirit? Faith, then, is rightly said to be the subsistence or substance of things which are as yet the objects of 			 hope and the evidence of things not seen. <i>Augustine</i> sometimes renders evidence &#8220;conviction,&#8221; which I do not disapprove, for it faithfully expresses the Apostle&#8217;s meaning: but I prefer &#8220;demonstration,&#8221; as it is more literal.</p>  <a name="xvii.ii"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption21"><a name="xvii.ii-p1"></A>Hebrews Chapter 11:2-4</p>

<p><a name="xvii.ii-p3"></A><b>2.</b> Per hane enim testimonium consequuti sunt seniores.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p4"></A><b>3.</b> Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</p>

<p><a name="xvii.ii-p8"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p9"></A><a name="xvii.ii-p9.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p10"></A><b>2.</b> <i>For by it the elders, </i>  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_202"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">203</FONT></A>
 			  <i>etc.</i> He handles this subject to the end of the chapter &#8212; that the fathers obtained salvation and were accepted by God in no other way than by faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p12"></A>The Jews indeed had some reasons for paying great deference to the fathers; but a foolish admiration of the fathers had so prevailed among them, that it proved a great hindrance to a thorough surrender of themselves to Christ and to his government. It was occasioned either by ambition or superstition, or by both. For when they heard that they were the blessed and holy seed of Abraham, inflated with this distinction they fixed their eyes on 			 men rather than on God. Then added to this was a false emulation; for they did not consider what was mainly worthy of imitation in their fathers. It thus happened that they became attached to the old ceremonies, as though the whole of religion and perfect holiness consisted in them. This error the Apostle exposes and condemns; and be shows what was the chief excellency of the fathers, in order that their posterity might understand how they might become really like them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p13"></A>Let us then bear in mind that the main point and the very hinge on which the Apostle&#8217;s argument turns is this, &#8212; That all the fathers from the beginning of the world, were approved by God in no other way than by being united to him by faith: and this he shows, that the Jews might know that by faith alone they could be bound together in holy unity with the fathers, and that as soon as they renounced faith, they became banished from the 			 Church, and that they were then no longer the legitimate children of Abraham, but a degenerate race and bastards.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_203"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">204</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p15"></A><a name="xvii.ii-p15.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p16"></A><b>3.</b> <i>Through,</i> or by, <i>faith we understand, </i>  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_204"></A><A HREF="#fn_204"><FONT SIZE="1">205</FONT></A>
 			  <i>etc.</i> This is a most striking proof of the last verse; for we differ nothing from the brute creation, if we understand not that the world has been created by God. To what end have men been endued with understanding and reason, except that they might acknowledge their Creator? But it is by faith alone we know that it was God who created the world. No wonder then that faith shone forth in the fathers above all other 			 virtues.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p20"></A>But it may be here asked, Why does the Apostle assert that what even infidels acknowledge is only understood by faith? For the very appearance of heaven and earth constrains even the ungodly to acknowledge some Maker; and hence Paul condemns all for ingratitude, because they did not, after having known God, give him the honor due to him. (<a name="xvii.ii-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025">Ro 1:25</a><a name="xvii.ii-p20.1"></A>.) And no 			 doubt religion would not have so prevailed among all nations, had not men&#8217;s minds been impressed with the convictions that God is the Creator of the world. It thus then appears that this knowledge which the Apostle ascribes to faith, exists without faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p21"></A>To this I reply, &#8212; that though there has been an opinion of this kind among heathens, that the world was made by God, it was yet very evanescent, for as soon as they formed a notion of some God, they became instantly vain in their imaginations, so that they groped in the dark, having in their thoughts a mere shadow of some uncertain deity, and not the knowledge of the true God. Besides, as it was only a transient opinion that flit in their 			 minds, it was far from being anything like knowledge. We may further add, that they assigned to fortune or chance the supremacy in the government of the world, and they made no mention of God&#8217;s providence which alone rules everything. Men&#8217;s minds therefore are wholly blind, so that they see not the light of nature which shines forth in created things, until being irradiated by God&#8217;s Spirit, they begin to understand by faith what otherwise they cannot comprehend. Hence most correctly does the 			 Apostle ascribe such an understanding to faith; for they who have faith do not entertain a slight opinion as to God being the Creator of the world, but they have a deep conviction fixed in their minds and behold the true God. And further, they understand the power of his word, not only as manifested instantaneously in creating the world, but also as put forth continually in its preservation; nor is it his power only that they understand, but also his goodness, and wisdom, and justice. And hence 			 they are led to worship, love, and honor him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p22"></A><i>Not made of things which do appear.</i> As to this clause, all interpreters seem to me to have been mistaken; and the mistake has arisen from separating the preposition from the participle &#966;&#945;&#8054;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#969;&#957;. They give this rendering, &#8220;So that visible things were made from things which do not appear.&#8221; But from such words hardly any sense can be elicited, at 			 least a very jejune sense; and further, the text does not admit of such a meaning, for then the words must have been, &#7952;&#954; &#956;&#8052; &#966;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#969;&#957;: but the order adopted by the Apostle is different. If, then, the words were rendered literally, the meaning would be as follows, &#8212; &#8220;So that they became the visible of things not visible,&#8221; or, not apparent. Thus the preposition would be joined to the participle to which it belongs. Besides, the words would then 			 contain a very important truth, &#8212; that we have in this visible world, a conspicuous image of God; and thus the same truth is taught here, as in <a name="xvii.ii-p22.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020">Ro 1:20</a><a name="xvii.ii-p22.1"></A>, where it is said, that the invisible things of God are made known to us by the creation of the world, they being seen in his works. God has given us, throughout the whole framework of this world, clear evidences of his eternal 			 wisdom, goodness, and power; and though he is in himself invisible, he in a manner becomes visible to us in his works.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_205"></A><A HREF="#fn_205"><FONT SIZE="1">206</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p27"></A>Correctly then is this world called the mirror of divinity; not that there is sufficient clearness for man to gain a full knowledge of God, by looking at the world, but that he has thus so far revealed himself, that the ignorance of the ungodly is without excuse. Now the faithful, to whom he has given eyes, see sparks of his glory, as it were, glittering in every created thing. The world was no doubt made, that it might be the theater of the 			 divine glory.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p28"></A><a name="xvii.ii-p28.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p29"></A><b>4.</b> <i>By faith Abel offered,</i> <i>etc.</i> The Apostle&#8217;s object in this chapter is to show, that however excellent were the works of the saints, it was from faith they derived their value, their worthiness, and all their excellences; and hence follows what he has already intimated, that the fathers pleased God by 			 faith alone.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p30"></A>Now he commends faith here on two accounts, &#8212; it renders obedience to God, for it attempts and undertakes nothing, but what is according to the rule of God&#8217;s word, &#8212; and it relies on God&#8217;s promises, and thus it gains the value and worth which belongs to works from his grace alone. Hence, wherever the word faith is found in this chapter, we must bear in mind, that the Apostle speaks of it, in order that the Jews might regard no other rule 			 than God&#8217;s word, and might also depend alone on his promises.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p31"></A>He says, first, that Abel&#8217;s <i>sacrifice</i> was for no other reason preferable to that of his brother, except that it was sanctified by faith:   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_206"></A><A HREF="#fn_206"><FONT SIZE="1">207</FONT></A>
 			  for surely the fat of brute animals did not smell so sweetly, that it could, by its odor, pacify God. The Scripture indeed shows plainly, why God accepted his sacrifice, for Moses&#8217;s words are these, &#8220;God had respect to Abel, and to his gifts.&#8221; It is hence obvious to conclude, that his sacrifice was accepted, because he himself was graciously accepted. But how did he obtain this favor, except that his heart was purified by faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p34"></A><i>God testifying,</i> etc. He confirms what I have already stated, that no works, coming from us can please God, until we ourselves are received into favor, or to speak more briefly, that no works are deemed just before God, but those of a just man: for he reasons thus, &#8212; God bore a testimony to Abel&#8217;s gifts; then he had obtained the praise of being just before God.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_207"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">208</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p37"></A>This doctrine is useful, and ought especially to be noticed, as we are not easily convinced of its truth; for when in any work, anything splendid appears, we are immediately rapt in admiration, and we think that it cannot possibly be disapproved of by God: but God, who regards only the inward purity of the heart, heeds not the outward masks of works. Let us then learn, that no right or good work can proceed from us, until we are justified 			 before God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p38"></A><i>By it he being dead,</i> <i>etc.</i> To faith he also ascribes this, &#8212; that God testified that Abel was no less the object of his care after his death, than during his life: for when he says, that though dead, he still speaketh, he means, as Moses tells us, that God was moved by his violent death to take vengeance. When, therefore, Abel or his blood is said to 			 speak, the words are to be understood figuratively. It was yet a singular evidence of God&#8217;s love towards him, that he had a care for him when he was dead; and it hence appears, that he was one of God&#8217;s saints, whose death is precious to him.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_208"></A><A HREF="#fn_208"><FONT SIZE="1">209</FONT></A>
</p>  <a name="xvii.iii"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption21"><a name="xvii.iii-p1"></A>Hebrews Chapter 11:5-6</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p2"></A><b>5.</b> By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p3"></A><b>5.</b> Fide Enoch translatus est ne videret mortem; neque inventus est propterea quod Deus illum transtulerat; nam ante translationem suam testimonium adeptus erat quod placuisset Deo.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p4"></A><b>6.</b> But without faith <i>it is</i> impossible to please <i>him</i>: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and <i>that</i> he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p5"></A><b>6.</b> Sine fide autem impossibile est placere Deo; nam qui ad Deum accedit, eum credere oportet quod sit, et quod remunerator sit iis qui eum quaerunt.</p> 				  			   		    		  
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p6"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p7"></A><a name="xvii.iii-p7.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p8"></A><b>5.</b> <i>By faith Enoch,</i> <i>etc.</i> He chose a few of the most ancient, that he might make a transition to Abraham and his posterity. He teaches us that through faith, it was that Enoch was translated.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p9"></A>But we ought especially to consider the reason why God in so unusual a manner removed him from the earth. The event was remarkable, and hence all may know how dear he was to God. Impiety and all kinds of corruptions then prevailed everywhere. Had he died as other men, it would have not occurred to any, that he was thus preserved from the prevailing contagion by God&#8217;s providence; but, as he was taken away without dying, the hand of God from 			 heaven, removing him as it were from the fire, was openly manifested. It was not to then an ordinary honor with which God had favored him. Moses indeed tells us, that he was a righteous man, and that he walked with God; but as righteousness begins with faith, it is justly ascribed to his faith, that he pleased God.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">210</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p11"></A>As to the subtle questions which the curious usually moot, it is better to pass them over, without taking much notice of them. They ask, what became of these two men, Enoch and Elijah? And then, that they may not appear merely to ask questions, they imagine that they are reserved for the last days of the Church, that they may then come forth into the world; and for this purpose the Revelation of John is referred to. Let us leave this airy 			 philosophy to those light and vain minds, which cannot be satisfied with what is solid. Let it suffice us to know, that their translation was a sort of extraordinary death; nor let us doubt but that they were divested of their mortal and corruptible flesh, in order that they might, with the other members of Christ, be renewed into a blessed immortality.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">211</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p14"></A><a name="xvii.iii-p14.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p15"></A><b>6.</b> <i>But without faith,</i> <i>etc.</i> What is said here belongs to all the examples which the Apostle records in this chapter; but as there is in the passage some measure of obscurity, it is necessary to examine its meaning more closely.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p16"></A>But there is no better interpreter than the Apostle himself. The proof, then, which he immediately subjoins, may serve as an explanation. The reason he assigns why no one can please God without faith, is this, &#8212; because no one will ever come to God, except he believes that God is, and is also convinced that he is a remunerator to all who seek him. If access then to God is not opened, but by faith, it follows, that all who are without it, 			 are the objects of God&#8217;s displeasure. Hence the Apostle shows how faith obtains favor for us, even because faith is our teacher as to the true worship of God, and makes us certain as to his goodwill, so that we may not think that we seek him in vain. These two clauses ought not to be slightly passed over, &#8212; that we must believe that God is, and that we ought to feel assured that he is not sought in vain.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">212</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p18"></A>It does not indeed seem a great matter, when the Apostle requires us to believe that God is; but when you more closely consider it, you will find that there is here a rich, profound, and sublime truth; for though almost all admit without disputing that God is, yet it is evident, that except the Lord retains us in the true and certain knowledge of himself, various doubts will ever creep in, and obliterate every thought of a Divine Being. To 			 this vanity the disposition of man is no doubt prone, so that to forget God becomes an easy thing. At the same time the Apostle does not mean, that men ought to feel assured that there is some God, for he speaks only of the true God; nay, it will not be sufficient for you to form a notion of any God you please; but you must understand what sort of Being the true God is; for what will it profit us to devise and form an idol, and to ascribe to it the glory due to God?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p19"></A>We now then perceive what the Apostle means in the first clause; he denies that we can have an access to God, except we have the truth, that God is deeply fixed in our hearts, so as not to be led here and there by various opinions.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p20"></A>It is hence evident, that men in vain weary themselves in serving God, except they observe the right way, and that all religions are not only vain, but also pernicious, with which the true and certain knowledge of God is not connected; for all are prohibited from having any access to God, who do not distinguish and separate him from all idols; in short, there is no religion except where this truth reigns dominant. But if the true knowledge 			 of God has its seat in our hearts it will not fail to lead us to honor and fear him; for God, without his majesty is not really known. Hence arises the desire to serve him, hence it comes that the whole life is so formed, that he is regarded as the end in all things</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p21"></A>The second clause is that we ought to be fully persuaded that God is not sought in vain; and this persuasion includes the hope of salvation and eternal life, for no one will be in a suitable state of heart to seek God except a sense of the divine goodness be deeply felt, so as to look for salvation from him. We indeed flee from God, or wholly disregard him, when there is no hope of salvation. But let us bear in mind, that this is what must 			 be really believed, and not held merely as a matter of opinions; for even the ungodly may sometimes entertain such a notion, and yet they do not come to God; and for this reason, because they have not a firm and fixed faith.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">213</FONT></A>
 			 This then is the other part of faith by which we obtain favor with God, even when we feel assured that salvation is laid up for us in him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p23"></A>But many shamefully pervert this clause; for they hence elicit the merits of works, and the conceit about deserving. And they reason thus: &#8220;We please God by faith, because we believe him to be a rewarder; then faith has respect to the merits of works.&#8221; This error cannot be better exposed, than by considering how God is to be sought; while any one is wandering from the right way of seeking him,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">214</FONT></A>
 			 he cannot be said to be engaged in the work. Now Scripture assigns this as the right way, &#8212; that a man, prostrate in himself, and smitten with the conviction that he deserves eternal death, and in self&shy;despair, is to flee to Christ as the only asylum for salvation. Nowhere certainly can we find that we are to bring to God any merits of works to put us in a state of favor with him. Then he who understands that this is the only right way of seeking God, will be freed from every 			 difficulty on the subject; for reward refers not to the worthiness or value of works but to faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p25"></A>Thus, these frigid glosses of the Sophists, such as, &#8220;by faith we please God, for we deserve when we intend to please,&#8221; fall wholly to the ground. The Apostle&#8217;s object was to carry us much higher, even that conscience might feel assured that it is not a vain thing to seek God; and this certainty or assurance far exceeds what we can of ourselves attain, especially when any one considers his own self. For it is not to be laid down as an 			 abstract principle, that God is a rewarder to those who seek him; but every one of us ought individually to apply this doctrine to himself, so that we may know that we are regarded by God, that he has such a care for our salvation as never to be wanting to us, that our prayers are heard by him, that he will be to us a perpetual deliverer. But as none of these things come to us except through Christ, our faith must ever regard him and cleave to him alone.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p26"></A>From these two clauses, we may learn how, and why it is impossible for man to please God without faith; God justly regards us all as objects of his displeasure, as we are all by nature under his curse; and we have no remedy in our own power. It is hence necessary that God should anticipate us by his grace; and hence it comes, that we are brought to know that God is, and in such a way that no corrupt superstition can seduce us, and also that 			 we become assured of a certain salvation from him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iii-p27"></A>Were any one to desire a fuller view of this subject, he should make his commencement here, &#8212; that we in vain attempt to try anything, except we look to God; for the only true end of life is to promote his glory; but this can never be done, unless there be first the true knowledge of him. Yet this is still but the half of faith, and will profit us but little, except confidence be added. Hence faith will only then be complete and secure us 			 God&#8217;s favor, when we shall feel a confidence that we shall not seek him in vain, and thus entertain the certainty of obtaining salvation from him. But no one, except he be blinded by presumption, and fascinated by self&shy;love, can feel assured that God will be a rewarder of his merits. Hence this confidence of which we speak recumbs not on works, nor on man&#8217;s own worthiness, but on the grace of God alone; and as grace is nowhere found but in Christ, it is on him alone that faith ought to be 			 fixed.</p>  <a name="xvii.iv"></A>

<p><a name="xvii.iv-p6"></A><b>7.</b> <i>By faith Noah,</i> <i>etc.</i> It was a wonderful example of magnanimity, that when the whole world were promising themselves impunity, and securely and unrestrainedly indulging themselves in sinful pleasures, Noah alone paid regard to Gods vengeance though deferred for a considerable time, &#8212; that he greatly 			 wearied himself for a hundred and twenty years in building the ark, &#8212; that he stood unshaken amidst the scoffs of so many ungodly men, &#8212; that he entertained no doubt but that he would be safe in the midst of the ruin of the whole world, &#8212; yea, that he felt sure of life as it were in the grave, even in the ark. It is briefly that I shall touch on the subject; each one can better for himself weigh all the circumstances.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iv-p7"></A>The Apostle ascribes to faith the praise of so remarkable a fortitude. He has been hitherto speaking of the fathers who lived in the first age of the world; but it was a kind of regeneration when Noah and his family emerged from the deluge. It is hence evident that in all ages men have neither been approved by God, nor performed anything worthy of praise otherwise than by faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iv-p8"></A>Let us now then see what are the things he presents to our consideration in the case of Noah. They are the following, &#8212; that having been warned of things to come, but not yet made visible, he feared, &#8212; that he built an ark, &#8212; that he condemned the world by building it, &#8212; and that he became the heir of that righteousness which is faith.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">215</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iv-p12"></A>What I have just mentioned is that which especially sets forth the power of faith; for the Apostle ever reminds us of this truth, that faith is the evidence of things not seen; and doubtless it is its peculiar office to behold in God&#8217;s word the things which are hid, and far removed from our senses. When it was declared to Noah that there would be a deluge after one hundred and twenty years, first, the length of time might have removed every 			 fear; secondly, the thing in itself seemed incredible; thirdly, he saw the ungodly heedlessly indulging in sinful pleasures; and lastly, the terrible announcement of a deluge might have appeared to him as intended only to terrify men. But Noah attended so much to God&#8217;s word, that turning away his eyes from the appearance of things at that time, he feared the destruction which God had threatened, as though it was present. Hence the faith which he had in God&#8217;s word prepared him to render 			 obedience to God; and of this he afterwards gave a proof by building the ark.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iv-p13"></A>But here a question is raised. Why does the Apostle make faith the cause of fear, since it has respect to promises of grace rather than to threatening? For Paul for this reason calls the Gospel, in which God&#8217;s righteousness is offered to us for salvation, the word of faith. It seems then to have been improperly stated, that Noah was by faith led to fear. To this, I reply, that faith indeed properly springs from promises; it is founded on 			 them, it rests on them. We hence say that Christ is the real object of faith, for through him our heavenly Father is reconciled to us, and by him all the promises of salvation are sealed and confirmed. Yet there is no reason why faith should not look to God and reverently receive whatever he may say; or if you prefer another way of stating the subject, it rightly belongs to faith to hear God whenever he speaks, and unhesitatingly to embrace whatsoever may proceed from his sacred mouth. Thus far 			 it has regard to commands and threatening, as well as to gratuitous promises. But as no man is moved as he ought and as much as is needful, to obey God&#8217;s commands, nor is sufficiently stirred up to deprecate his wrath, unless he has already laid hold on the promises of grace, so as to acknowledge him as a kind Father, and the author of salvation, &#8212; hence the Gospel is called the word of faith, the principal part being stated for the whole; and thus is set forth the mutual relation that there is 			 between them both. Faith, then, though its most direct regard is to God&#8217;s promises, yet looks on his threatening so far as it is necessary for it to be taught to fear and obey God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iv-p14"></A><i>Prepared an ark,</i> <i>etc.</i> Here is pointed out that obedience which flows from faith as water from a fountain. The work of building the ark was long and laborious. It might have been haltered by the scoffs of the ungodly, and thus suspended a thousand times; nor is there a doubt but they mocked and derided the holy man on every side. That he then bore 			 their wanton insults with an unshaken spirit, is a proof that his resolution to obey was not of an ordinary kind. But how was it that he so perseveringly obeyed God except that he had previously rested on the promise which gave him the hope of deliverance; and in this confidence he persevered even to the last; for he could not have had the courage willingly to undergo so many toils, nor could he have been able to overcome so many obstacles, nor could he have stood so firm in his purpose for so 			 long a time, had he not beforehand possessed this confidence.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iv-p15"></A>It hence appears that faith alone is the teacher of obedience; and we may on the contrary draw this conclusion, that it is unbelief that prevents us to obey God. And at this day the unbelief of the world exhibits itself dreadfully in this way, for there are a very few who obey God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iv-p16"></A><i>By the which he condemned the world,</i> <i>etc.</i> It were strange to say that Noah&#8217;s deliverance condemned the world, and the context will hardly allow faith to be meant; we must then understand this of the ark. And he is said on two accounts to have by the ark condemned the world; for by being so long occupied in building it, he took away every excuse from 			 the wicked; &#8212; and the event which followed proved how just was the destruction of the world; for why was the ark made the means of deliverance to one family, except that the Lord thus spared a righteous man that he should not perish with the ungodly. Had he then not been preserved, the condemnation of the world would not have been so apparent. Noah then by obeying God&#8217;s command condemned by his example the obstinate disobedience of the world: his wonderful deliverance from the midst of death, 			 was an evidence that the world justly perished; for God would have doubtless saved it, had it not been unworthy of salvation</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.iv-p17"></A><i>Of the righteousness which is by faith.</i> This is the last thing in the character of Noah, which the Apostle reminds us to observe. Moses records that he was a righteous man: history does not expressly say that the cause and root of his righteousness was faith, but the Apostle declares that as arising from the facts of the case. And this is not only true, because no one ever devotes himself really and 			 sincerely to God&#8217;s service, but he who relies on the promises of his paternal kindness, and feels assured that his life is approved by him; but also on this account, because the life of no one, however holy it may be, when tried by the rule of God&#8217;s law, can please him without pardon being granted. Then righteousness must necessarily recumb on faith.</p>  <a name="xvii.v"></A>

But he now reminds them of what they ought to 			 possess as the main thing, that they might be counted among his children. He therefore calls their attention to faith, for Abraham himself had no excellency which did not proceed from faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.v-p15"></A>He first teaches us that faith was the cause why he immediately obeyed God when he was commanded to remove from his own country; and then that through the same faith it was that he went on without wavering, according to what he was called to do even to the end. By these two things, &#8212; his promptness in obeying, and his perseverance, was Abraham&#8217;s faith most clearly proved.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.v-p16"></A><i>When he was called,</i> <i>etc.</i> The old Latin translator and Erasmus apply this to his name, which is extremely tame and frigid. On the contrary, I refer it to the oracle by which he was called from his own country. He indeed did in this way undergo a voluntary exile, while yet he did nothing but by God&#8217;s command; and no doubt it is one of the chief things 			 which belong to faith, not to move a step except God&#8217;s word shows us the way, and as a lantern gives us light, according to what David says. (<a name="xvii.v-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#105">Ps 119:105</a><a name="xvii.v-p16.1"></A>.)

 			  <i>etc.</i> To the command was added a promise, that God would give him a land for an inheritance. This promise he immediately embraced, and hastened as though he was sent to take possession of this land. It is a no ordinary trial of faith to give up what we have in hand, in order to seek what is afar off, and unknown to us. For when God commanded him to leave his own country, he did not point out the place where he 			 intended him to live, but left him in suspense and perplexity of mind: &#8220;go&#8221;, he said, &#8220;into the place that I will show thee.&#8221; (<a name="xvii.v-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001">Ge 12:1</a><a name="xvii.v-p18.1"></A>.) Why did he defer to point out the place, except that his faith might be more and more exercised? Besides, the love of his native land might not only have retarded the alacrity of Abraham, but also held him so bound to it, so as not to quit his 			 home. His faith then was not of an ordinary kind, which thus broke through all hindrances and carried him where the Lord called him to go.</p>

Still greater was the 			 disappointment, which the Apostle does not mention, when shortly after a famine drove him from the country, when he was compelled to flee to the land of Gerar; but the Apostle considered it enough to say, as a commendation to his faith, that he became a sojourner in the land of promise; for to be a sojourner seemed contrary to what had been promised.

It was no doubt a great thing to cherish in their hearts the assurance given them by God respecting the possession of the land 			 until it was after some ages realized; yet as they did not confine their thoughts, no, not to that land, but penetrated even into heaven, it was still a clearer evidence of their faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.v-p25"></A>He calls heaven a <i>city that has foundations,</i> because of its perpetuity; for in the world there is nothing but what is transitory and fading. It may indeed appear strange that he makes God the Maker of heavens as though he did not also create the earth; to this I answer, that as in earthly buildings, the hands of men make use of materials, the workmanship of God is not unfitly 			 set in opposition to them. Now, whatever is formed by men is like its authors in instability; so also is the perpetuity of the heavenly life, it corresponds with the nature of God its founder.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">218</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xvii.v-p28"></A><b>11.</b> <i>Through faith also, Sarah herself,</i> <i>etc.</i> That women may know that this truth belongs to them as well as to men, he adduces the example of Sarah; which he mentions in preference to that of others, because she was the mother of all the faithful.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.v-p29"></A>But it may seem strange that her faith is commended, who was openly charged with unbelief; for she laughed at the word of the angel as though it were a fable; and it was not the laugh of wonder and admiration, for otherwise she would not have been so severely reproved by the angel. It must indeed be confessed, that her faith was blended with unbelief;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_218"></A><A HREF="#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">219</FONT></A>
 			 but as she cast aside her unbelief when reproved, her faith is acknowledged by God and commended. What then she rejected at first as being incredible, she afterwards as soon as she heard that it came from God, obediently received.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.v-p32"></A>And hence we deduce a useful doctrine, &#8212; that when our faith in some things wavers or halts, it ceases not to be approved of God, provided we indulge not the spirit of unbelief. The meaning then is, that the miracle which God performed when Isaac was born, was the fruit of the faith of Abraham, and of his wife, by which they laid hold on the power of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.v-p33"></A><i>Because she judged him faithful,</i> <i>etc.</i> These reasons, by which the power and character of faith are set forth, ought to be carefully noticed. Were any one only to hear that Sarah brought forth a child through faith, all that is meant would not be conveyed to him, but the explanation which the Apostle adds removes every obscurity; for he declares that 			 Sarah&#8217;s faith was this, &#8212; that she counted God to be true to his word, that is, to what he had promised.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.v-p34"></A>There are two clauses to this declaration; for we hence learn first, that there is no faith without God&#8217;s word, for of his faithfulness we cannot be convinced, until he has spoken. And this of itself is abundantly sufficient to confute the fiction of the sophists respecting implicit faith; for we must ever hold that there is a mutual relation between God&#8217;s word and our faith. But as faith is founded chiefly, according to what has been already 			 said, on the benevolence or kindness of God, it is not every word, though coming from his mouth, that is sufficient; but a promise is necessary as an evidence of his favor. Hence Sarah is said to have counted God faithful who had promised. True faith then is that which hears God speaking and rests on his promise.</p>

 			  and Sarah his wife, who had been barren in the flower of her age, was now sterile, being far advanced in years. Sooner then might oil be expected to flow from a stone, than a nation to proceed from them: and yet there sprang from them an innumerable multitude. If now the Jews are proud of their origin, let them consider what it was. Whatever they are, everything is doubtless to be ascribed to the faith of Abraham and Sarah.

</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.vi-p15"></A>At the same time the expression <i>in faith,</i> is differently explained. Some understand simply this that they died in faith, because in this life they never enjoyed the promised blessings, as at this day also salvation is hid from us, being hoped for. But I rather assent to those who think that there is expressed here a difference between us and the fathers; and I give this 			 explanation, &#8212; &#8220;Though God gave to the fathers only a taste of that grace which is largely poured on us, though he showed to them at a distance only an obscure representation of Christ, who is now set forth to us clearly before our eyes, yet they were satisfied and never fell away from their faith: how much greater reason then have we at this day to persevere? If we grow faint, we are doubly inexcusable&#8221;. It is then an enhancing circumstance, that the fathers had a distant view of the spiritual 			 kingdom of Christ, while we at this day have so near a view of it, and that they hailed the promises afar off, while we have them as it were quite near us; for if they nevertheless persevered even unto death, what sloth will it be to become wearied in faith, when the Lord sustains us by so many helps. Were any one to object and say, that they could not have believed without receiving the promises on which faith is necessarily founded: to this the answer is, that the expression is to be 			 understood comparatively; for they were far from that high position to which God has raised us. Hence it is that though they had the same salvation promised them, yet they had not the promises so clearly revealed to them as they are to us under the kingdom of Christ; but they were content to behold them afar off.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">223</FONT></A>

Since Jacob 			 confessed himself a pilgrim in the land, which had been promised to him as a perpetual inheritance, it is quite evident that his mind was by no means fixed on this world, but that he raised it up above the heavens. Hence the Apostle concludes, that the fathers, by speaking thus, openly showed that they had a better country in heaven; for as they were pilgrims here, they had a country and an abiding habitation elsewhere.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.vi-p18"></A>But if they in spirit amid dark clouds, took a flight into the celestial country, what ought we to do at this day? For Christ stretches forth his hand to us, as it were openly, from heaven, to raise us up to himself.

<p><a name="xvii.vii-p16"></A><b>17.</b> <i>By faith Abraham,</i> <i>etc.</i> He proceeds with the history of Abraham, and relates the offering up of his son; and it was a singular instance of firmness, so that there is hardly another like it to be found. Hence for the sake of enhancing it, he adds, <i>when he was 			 tempted,</i> or tried. Abraham had indeed already proved what he was, by many trials; yet as this trial surpassed every other, so the Apostle would have it to be regarded above all his trials. It is then as though he had said, &#8220;The highest excellency of Abraham was the sacrificing of his son:&#8221; for God is said to have then in an especial manner tried him. And yet this act flowed from faith; then Abraham had nothing more excellent than faith, which brought forth such 			 extraordinary fruit.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.vii-p17"></A>The word, <i>tempted</i> or <i>tried</i>, means no other thing than proved. What James says, that we are not tempted by God, is to be understood differently, (<a name="xvii.vii-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013">Jas 1:13</a><a name="xvii.vii-p17.1"></A>;) he means that God does not tempt us to do evil; for he 			 testifies that this is really done by every man&#8217;s own lust. At the same time he says not that God does not try our integrity and obedience, though God does not thus search us, as if he knew not otherwise what is hid in our hearts; nay, God wants no probation that he may know us; but when he brings us to the light, that we may by our works show what was before hid, he is said to try or prove us; and then that which is made openly manifest, is said to be made known to God. For it is a very usual 			 and frequent mode of speaking in Scripture, that what is peculiar to men is ascribed to God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.vii-p18"></A>The sacrificing of Isaac is to be estimated according to the purpose of the heart: for it was not owing to Abraham that he did not actually perform what he was commanded to do. His resolution to obey was then the same, as though he had actually sacrificed his son.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.vii-p19"></A><i>And offered up his only-begotten Son,</i> <i>etc.</i> By these various circumstances, the Apostle intended to show, how great and how severe the trial of Abraham was; and there are still other things related by Moses, which had the same tendency. Abraham was commanded to take his own son, his only begotten and beloved son Isaac, to lead to the place, which was 			 afterwards to be shown to him, and there to sacrifice him with his own hands. These tender words God seems to have designedly accumulated, that he might pierce the inmost heart of the holy man, as with so many wounds; and then that he might more severely try him, he commanded him to go a three&shy;days&#8217; journey. How sharp, must we think, was his anguish to have continually before his eyes his own son, whom he had already resolved to put to a bloody death! As they were coming to the place, Isaac 			 pierced his breast with yet a new wound, by asking him, &#8220;Where is the victim?&#8221; The death of a son, under any circumstances, must have been very grievous, a bloody death would have still caused a greater sorrow; but when he was bidden to slay his own, &#8212; that indeed must have been too dreadful for a father&#8217;s heart to endure; and he must have been a thousand times disabled, had not faith raised up his heart above the world. It is not then without reason, that the apostle records that he was then 			 <i>tried.</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.vii-p20"></A>It may, however, be asked, why is Isaac called the only begotten, for Ishmael was born before him and was still living. To this the answer is, that by God&#8217;s express command he was driven from the family, so that he was accounted as one dead, at least, he held no place among Abraham&#8217;s children.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.vii-p21"></A><i>And he that received the promises,</i> <i>etc.</i> All the things we have hitherto related, however deeply they must have wounded the heart of Abraham, yet they were but slight wounds compared with this trial, when he was commanded, after having received the promises, to slay his son Isaac; for all the promises were founded on this declaration, &#8220;In Isaac shall 			 thy seed be called,&#8221; (<a name="xvii.vii-p21.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012">Ge 21:12</a><a name="xvii.vii-p21.1"></A>;)   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">225</FONT></A>
 			  for when this foundation was taken away, no hope of blessing or of grace remained. Here nothing earthly was the matter at issue, but the eternal salvation of Abraham, yea, of the whole world. Into what straits must the holy man have been brought when it came to his mind, that the hope of eternal life was to be extinguished in the person of his son? And yet by faith he emerged above all these thoughts, so as to execute what he was commanded. Since it was a marvelous 			 fortitude to struggle through so many and so great obstacles, justly is the highest praise awarded to faith, for it was by faith alone that Abraham continued invincibly.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.vii-p23"></A>But here arises no small difficulty, How is it that Abraham&#8217;s faith is praised when it departs from the promise? For as obedience proceeds from faith, so faith from the promise; then when Abraham was without the promise, his faith must have necessarily fallen to the ground. But the death of Isaac, as it has been already said, must have been the death as it were of all the promises; for Isaac is not to be considered as a common man, but as 			 one who had Christ included in him. This question, which would have been otherwise difficult to be solved, the Apostle explains by adding immediately, that Abraham ascribed this honor to God, that he was able to raise his son again from the dead. He then did not renounce the promise given to him, but extended its power and its truth beyond the life of his son; for he did not limit God&#8217;s power to so narrow bounds as to tie it to Isaac when dead, or to extinguish it. Thus he retained the promise, 			 because he bound not God&#8217;s power to Isaac&#8217;s life, but felt persuaded that it would be efficacious in his ashes when dead no less than in him while alive and breathing.</p>

The word<i> figure,</i> which is here used, is variously explained. I take it 			 simply as meaning likeness; for though Isaac did not really rise from the dead, yet he seemed to have in a manner risen, when he was suddenly and wonderfully rescued through the unexpected favor of God.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_225"><FONT SIZE="1">226</FONT></A>
 			  However, I do not dislike what some say, who think that our flesh, which is subject to death, is set forth in the ram which was substituted for Isaac. I also allow that to be true which some have taught, that this sacrifice was a representation of Christ. But I have now to state what the Apostle meant, not what may in truth be said; and the real meaning here, as I think, is, that Abraham did not receive his Son otherwise than if he had been restored from death to 			 new life.</p>

<p><a name="xvii.vii-p28"></A><b>20.</b> <i>By faith Isaac,</i> <i>etc.</i> It was also the work of faith to bless as to future things; for when the thing itself does not exist and the word only appears, faith must necessarily bear rule. But first we must notice of what avail is the blessing of which he speaks. For to <i>bless</i> often means to pray for a blessing. But the blessing of Isaac was very different; for it was as it were an introduction into the possession of the land, which God had promised to him and his posterity. And yet he had nothing in that land but the right of burial. Then strange seemed these high titles, &#8220;Let people serve thee, and tribes bow down to thee,&#8221; (<a name="xvii.vii-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029">Ge 27:29</a><a name="xvii.vii-p28.1"></A>;) for what dominion could he have given who himself was hardly a free man? We hence see that this blessing depended on faith; for Isaac had nothing which he could have bestowed on his children but the word of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.vii-p29"></A>It may, however, be doubted whether there was any faith in the blessing given to Esau, as he was a reprobate and rejected by God. The answer is easy, for faith mainly shone forth, when he distinguished between the two twins born to him, so that he gave the first place to the younger; for following the oracle of God, he took away from the firstborn the ordinary right of nature. And on this depended the condition of the whole nation, that 			 Jacob was chosen by God, and that this choice was sanctioned by the blessing of the father.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.vii-p30"></A><a name="xvii.vii-p30.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.vii-p31"></A><b>21.</b> <i>By faith Jacob,</i> <i>etc.</i> It was the Apostle&#8217;s object to attribute to faith whatever was worthy of remembrance in the history of the people: as, however, it would have been tedious to recount everything, he selected a few things out of many, such at this. For the tribe of Ephraim was so superior to 			 the rest, that they in a manner did lie down under its shade; for the Scripture often includes the ten tribes under this name. And yet Ephraim was the younger of the two sons of Joseph, and when Jacob blessed him and his brother, they were both young. What did Jacob observe in the younger, to prefer him to the first born? Nay, when he did so, his eyes were dim with age, so that he could not see. Nor did he lay his right hand by chance on the head of Ephraim, but he crossed his hands, so that he 			 moved his right hand to the left side. Besides, he assigned to them two portions, as though he was now the Lord of that land, from which famine had driven him away. There was nothing here agreeable to reason; but faith ruled supreme. If, then, the Jews wish to be anything, they should glory in nothing else, but in faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.vii-p32"></A><i>And worshipped on the top,</i> <i>etc.</i> This is one of those places from which we may conclude that the points were not formerly used by the Hebrews; for the Greek translators could not have made such a mistake as to put staff here for a bed, if the mode of writing was then the same as now. No doubt Moses spoke of the head of his couch, when he said 			 <a name="xvii.vii-p32.1"></A>&#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513; &#1492;&#1502;&#1496;&#1492; but the Greek translators rendered the words, &#8220;On the top of his staff&#8221; as though the last word was written, <i>mathaeh.</i> The Apostle hesitated not to apply to his purpose what was commonly received: he was indeed writing to the Jews; but they who were dispersed into various countries, had changed their own language for the Greek. 			 And we know that the Apostles were not so scrupulous in this respect, as not to accommodate themselves to the unlearned, who had as yet need of milk; and in this there is no danger, provided readers are ever brought back to the pure and original text of Scripture. But, in reality, the difference is but little; for the main thing was, that Jacob worshipped, which was an evidence of his gratitude. He was therefore led by faith to submit himself to his son.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_226"><FONT SIZE="1">227</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xvii.viii-p15"></A>But he seems to say what is contrary to the character of faith, when he says that they were induced to do this by the beauty of the child; for we know that Jesse was reproved, when he brought his sons to Samuel as each excelled in personal appearance; and doubtless God would not have us to regard what is externally attractive. To this I answer, that the parents of Moses were not charmed with beauty, so as to be induced by pity to save him, 			 as the case is commonly with men; but that there was some mark, as it were, of future excellency imprinted on the child, which gave promise of something extraordinary. There is, then, no doubt but that by his very appearance they were inspired with the hope of an approaching deliverance; for they considered that the child was destined for the performance of great things.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.viii-p16"></A>Moreover, it ought to have had a great weight with the Jews, to hear that Moses, the minister of their redemption, had been in an extraordinary manner rescued from death by means of faith. We must, however, remark, that the faith here praised was very weak; for after having disregarded the fear of death, they ought to have brought up Moses; instead of doing so, they exposed him. It is hence evident that their faith in a short time not only 			 wavered, but wholly failed; at least they neglected their duty when they cast forth the infant on the bank of the river. But it behaves us to be more encouraged when we hear that their faith, though weak, was yet so approved by God as to secure that life to Moses, on which depended the deliverance of the Church.</p>

<p><a name="xvii.viii-p18"></A><b>24.</b> <i>By faith Moses, when he was come to years,</i> <i>etc.</i> The example of Moses ought to have been remembered by the Jews, more than that of any other; for through him they were delivered from bondage, and the covenant of God was renewed, with them, and the constitution of the Church established by the 			 publication of the Law. But if faith is to be considered as the main thing in Moses, it would be very strange and unreasonable that he should draw them away to anything else. It hence follows that all they make a poor proficiency in the Law who are not guided by it to faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.viii-p19"></A>Let us now see what the things are for which he commends the faith of Moses. The first excellency he mentions is, that when grown up, he disregarded the adoption of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter. He refers to his age, for had he done this when a boy, it might have been imputed to his levity, or his ignorance; for as understanding and reason are not strong in children, they heedlessly rush headlong into any course of life; young people also are often 			 carried here and there by unreflecting ardor. That we may then know that nothing was done thoughtlessly, and without a long deliberation, the Apostle says, that he was of mature age, which is also evident from history.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_227"></A><A HREF="#fn_227"><FONT SIZE="1">228</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.viii-p22"></A>But he is said to have disregarded his adoption; for when he visited his brethren, when he tried to relieve them, when he avenged their wrongs, he fully proved that he preferred to return to his own nation, rather than to remain in the king&#8217;s court: it was then the same as a voluntary rejection of it. This the Apostle ascribes to faith; for it would have been much better for him to remain in Egypt, had he not been persuaded of the blessing 			 promised to the race of Abraham; and of this blessing, the only witness was God&#8217;s promise; for he could see nothing of the kind with his eyes. It hence appears, that he beheld by faith what was far removed from his sight.</p>

<p><a name="xvii.viii-p24"></A><b>26</b> <i> Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches,</i> <i>etc.</i> This clause ought to be carefully noticed; for we here learn that we ought to shun as a deadly poison whatever cannot be enjoyed without offending God; for the <i>pleasures of sin</i> he calls all 			 the allurements of the world which draw us away from God and our calling. But the comforts of our earthly life, which we are allowed by pure conscience, and God&#8217;s permission to enjoy, are not included here. Let us then ever remember that we ought to know and understand what God allows us. There are indeed some things in themselves lawful, but the use of which is prohibited to us, owing to circumstances as to time, place, or other things. Hence as to all the blessings connected with the present 			 life, what is ever to be regarded is, that they should be to us helps and aids to follow God and not hindrances.

<p><a name="xvii.viii-p26"></A>In opposition to these he sets the <i>reproach of Christ,</i> which all the godly ought willingly to undergo. For those whom God has chosen, he has also foreordained to be conformed to the image of his own son; not that he exercises them all by the same kind of reproaches or by the same cross, but that they are all to be so minded as not to decline to undertake the cross in 			 common with Christ. Let every one then bear in mind, that as he is called to this fellowship he is to throw off all hindrances. Nor must we omit to say, that he reckons among the reproaches of Christ all the ignominious trials which the faithful have had to endure from the beginning of the world; for as they were the member of the same body, so they had nothing different from what we have. As all sorrows are indeed the rewards of sin, so they are also the fruits of the curse pronounced on the 			 first man: but whatever wrongs we endure from the ungodly on account of Christ, these he regards as his own.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_229"></A><A HREF="#fn_229"><FONT SIZE="1">230</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xvii.viii-p33"></A>He also explains more fully what he means in this clause by the <i>reproach of Christ,</i> by what he has previously declared when he said, that Moses chose to<i> suffer affliction with the people of God.</i> He could not have otherwise avowed himself as one of God&#8217;s people, except he had made himself a companion to his own nation in 			 their miseries. Since, then, this is the end, let us not separate ourselves from the body of the Church: whatever we suffer, let us know that it is consecrated on account of the head. So on the other hand he calls those things the <i>treasures of Egypt,</i> which no one can otherwise possess than by renouncing and forsaking the Church.</p>

 			  He proves by the description he gives, that the magnanimity of Moses&#8217; mind was owing to faith; for he had his eyes fixed on the promise of God. For he could not have hoped that it would be better for him to be with the people of Israel than with the Egyptians, had he not trusted in the promise and in nothing else.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.viii-p36"></A>But if any one hence concludes, that his faith did not recumb on God&#8217;s mercy alone, because he had respect to the reward; to this I answer, that the question here is not respecting righteousness or the cause of salvation, but that the Apostle generally includes what belongs to faith. Then faith, as to righteousness before God, does not look on reward, but on the gratuitous goodness of God, not on our works but on Christ alone; but faith, 			 apart from justification, since it extends generally to every word of God, has respect to the reward that is promised; yea, by faith we embrace whatever God promises: but he promises reward to works; then faith lays hold on this.

<p><a name="xvii.viii-p38"></A><b>27.</b> <i>By faith he forsook Egypt,</i> <i>etc.</i> This may be said of his first as well as of his second departure, that is, when he brought out the people with him. He then indeed left Egypt when he fled from the house of Pharaoh. Add to this, that his going out is recorded by the Apostle before he mentions the 			 celebration of the Passover. He seems then to speak of the flight of Moses; nor is what he adds, that he<i> feared not the wrath of the king,</i> any objection to this, though Moses himself relates that he was constrained to do so by fear. For if we look at the beginning of his course he did not fear, that is, when he avowed himself to be the avenger of his people. However, when I consider all the circumstances, I am inclined to regard this as his 			 second departure; for it was then that he bravely disregarded the fierce wrath of the king, being armed with such power by God&#8217;s Spirit, that he often of his own accord defied the fury of that wild beast. It was doubtless an instance of the wonderful strength of faith, that he brought out a multitude untrained for war and burdened with many incumbrances, and yet hoped that a way would be opened to him by God&#8217;s hand through innumerable difficulties. He saw a most powerful king in a furious rage, 			 and he knew that he would not cease till he had tried his utmost. But as he knew that God had commanded him to depart, he committed the event to him, nor did he doubt but that he would in due time restrain all the assaults of the Egyptians.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.viii-p39"></A><i>As seeing him who is invisible.</i> Nay, but he had seen God in the midst of the burning bush: this then seems to have been said improperly, and not very suitable to the present subject. I indeed allow, that Moses was strengthened in his faith by that vision, before he took in hand the glorious work of delivering the people; but I do not admit that it was such a view of God, as divested him of his 			 bodily senses, and transferred him beyond the trials of this world. God at that time only showed him a certain symbol of his presence; but he was far from seeing God as he is. Now, the Apostle means, that Moses so endured, as though he was taken up to heaven, and had God only before his eyes; and as though he had nothing to do with men, was not exposed to the perils of this world and had no contests with Pharaoh. And yet, it is certain, that he was surrounded with so many difficulties, that he 			 could not but think sometimes that God was far away from him, or at least, that the obstinacy of the king, furnished as it was with so many means of resistance, would at length overcome him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.viii-p40"></A>In short, God appeared to Moses in such a way, as still to leave room for faith; and Moses, when beset by terrors on every side, turned all his thoughts to God. He was indeed assisted to do this, by the vision which we have mentioned; but yet he saw more in God than what that symbol intimated: for he understood his power, and that absorbed all his fears and dangers. Relying on God&#8217;s promise, he felt assured that the people, though then 			 oppressed by the tyranny of the Egyptians, were already, as it were, the lords of the promised land.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_231"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">232</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.viii-p42"></A>We hence learn, that the true character of faith is to set God always before our eyes; secondly, that faith beholds higher and more hidden things in God than what our senses can perceive; and thirdly, that a view of God alone is sufficient to strengthen our weakness, so that we may become firmer than rocks to withstand all the assaults of Satan. It hence follows, that the weaker and the less resolute any one is, the less faith he has.</p>  <a name="xvii.ix"></A>

<p><a name="xvii.ix-p12"></A><b>28.</b> <i>Through faith he kept the Passover,</i> <i>etc.</i> This ought to have availed much to commend faith to the Jews; for they held this first sacrifice of the Passover in the highest esteem. But, he says, that it was kept by faith, not because the Paschal lamb was a type of Christ, but because its benefit did 			 not appear, when he sprinkled the doorposts with blood: when therefore the effect was yet hid, it was necessarily looked for by faith. Nay, it might have seemed strange, that Moses should set a few drops of blood, as a remedy, in opposition to God&#8217;s vengeance; but being satisfied with God&#8217;s word alone, that the people would be exempt from the scourge that was coming on the Egyptians, he did not hesitate. Hence the Apostle justly commends his faith in this respect.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ix-p13"></A>They who explain that the Passover was by faith celebrated by Moses, because he had respect to Christ, say indeed what is true; but the Apostle here records simply his faith, because he acquiesced in God&#8217;s word alone, when the effect did not appear: therefore out of place here are philosophical refinements. And the reason why he mentions Moses alone, as celebrating the Passover, seems to be this, that God through him instituted the Passover. 			  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_232"><FONT SIZE="1">233</FONT></A>

But in doing the same thing, there was a great difference between the Israelites and the 			 Egyptians; while the former passed through safely, the latter coming after them were drowned. Whence was this difference, but that the Israelites had the word of God, and that the Egyptians were without it. The argument then derives its force from what happened to the contrary; hence, he says, that the <i>Egyptians were drowned.</i> That disastrous event was the punishment of their temerity, as on the other hand, the Israelites were preserved safe, 			 because they relied on God&#8217;s word, and refused not to march through the midst of the waters.</p>

For at their first entrance the city Jericho stood in their way; it being 			 fortified and almost impregnable, it impeded any farther progress, and they had no means to assail it. The Lord commanded all the men&shy;of&shy;war to go round it once every day, and on the seventh day seven times. It appeared to be a work childish and ridiculous; and yet they obeyed the divine command; nor did they do so in vain, for success according to the promise followed.

<p><a name="xvii.ix-p19"></A>We may also apply this event to our benefit and instruction: for it is not otherwise, than by faith, that we can be freed from the tyranny of the Devil, and be brought to liberty; and by the same faith, it is that we can put to flight our enemies, and that all the strongholds of hell can be demolished.</p>

He has hitherto shown that the 			 Patriarchs, whom the Jews most honored and venerated, did nothing worthy of praise except through faith; and that all the benefits conferred on us by God, even the most remarkable, have been the fruits of the same faith: but he now teaches us, that an alien woman, not only of a humble condition among her own people, but also a harlot, had been adopted into the body of the Church through faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ix-p22"></A>It hence follows, that those who are most exalted, are of no account before God, unless they have faith; and that, on the other hand, those who are hardly allowed a place among the profane and the reprobate, are by faith introduced into the company of angels.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ix-p23"></A>Moreover, James also bears testimony to the faith of Rahab, (<a name="xvii.ix-p23.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025">Jas 2:25</a><a name="xvii.ix-p23.1"></A>,) and it may be easily concluded from sacred history, that she was endued with true faith; for she professed her full persuasion of what God had promised to the Israelites; and of those whom fear kept from entering the land, she asked pardon for 			 herself and her friends, as though they were already conquerors; and in all this, she did not consider men, but God himself. The evidence of her faith was, that she received the spies at the peril of her life: then, by means of faith, she escaped safe from the ruin of her own city. She is mentioned as a <i>harlot,</i> in order to amplify the grace of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ix-p24"></A>Some, indeed, render <a name="xvii.ix-p24.1"></A>&#1494;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; a hostess, as though she kept a public house, or an inn; but as the word means a harlot everywhere in Scripture, there is no reason why we should explain it otherwise in this place.

 			  But such a fear was groundless; for in the history of Joshua, this word, harlot, is expressly added, in order that we may know that the spies came into the city Jericho clandestinely, and concealed themselves in a harlot&#8217;s house. At the same time this must be understood of her past life; for faith is an evidence of repentance.</p>  <a name="xvii.x"></A>

<p><a name="xvii.x-p11"></A>He first refers to the time that intervened between Joshua and David, when the Lord raised up judges to govern the people; and such were the four he now mentions, <i>Gideon, Barak, Samson</i>, and <i>Jephthah.</i></p>

Who would not at first have condemned the rashness of <i>Jephthah</i>, who avowed himself the avenger of a people already past hope? But as they all followed the guidance of God, and being animated by his promise, undertook what was commanded them, they have been honored with the testimony of the Holy 			 Spirit.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_234"><FONT SIZE="1">235</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.x-p14"></A>Then the Apostle ascribes all that was praiseworthy in them to faith; though there was not one of them whose faith did not halt.<i> Gideon</i> was slower to take up arms than what he ought to have been; nor did he venture without some hesitation to commit himself to God. <i>Barak</i> at first trembled, so that he was almost forced by the 			 reproofs of Deborah. <i>Samson</i> being overcome by the blandishments of a concubine, inconsiderately betrayed the safety of the whole people. <i>Jephthah</i>, hasty in making a foolish vow, and too obstinate in performing it, marred the finest victory by the cruel death of his own daughter. Thus, in all the saints, something reprehensible is ever to be found; yet faith, though halting and imperfect, is still 			 approved by God. There is, therefore, no reason why the faults we labor under should break us down, or dishearten us, provided we by faith go on in the race of our calling.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.x-p15"></A><i>Of David,</i> <i>etc.</i> Under David&#8217;s name he includes all the pious kings, and to them he adds <i>Samuel</i> and the <i>Prophets.</i> He therefore means in short to teach us, that the kingdom of Judah was founded in faith; and that it stood to the last by faith. The many 			 victories of David, which he had gained over his enemies, were commonly known. Known also, was the uprightness of Samuel, and his consummate wisdom in governing the people. Known too were the great favors conferred by God on prophets and kings. The Apostle declares that there are none of these things which ought not to be ascribed to faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.x-p16"></A>But it is to some only of these innumerable benefits of God that he refers, in order that the Jews might from them draw a general conclusion, &#8212; that as the Church has always been preserved by God&#8217;s hand through faith, so at this day there is no other way by which we may know his kindness towards us.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.x-p17"></A>It was by faith that David so many times returned home as a conqueror; that Hezekiah recovered from his sickness; that Daniel came forth safe and untouched from the lions&#8217; den, and that his friends walked in a burning furnace as cheerfully as on a pleasant meadow.

<p><a name="xvii.xi-p16"></A><b>35.</b> <i>Women received,</i> <i>etc.</i> He had already mentioned instances in which God had remunerated the faith of his servants, he now refers to examples of a different kind, &#8212; that saints, reduced to extreme miseries, struggled by faith so as to persevere invincible even to death. These instances at the first 			 view widely differ: some triumphed gloriously over vanquished enemies, were preserved by the Lord through various miracles, and were rescued by means new and unusual from the midst of death; while others were shamefully treated, were despised by almost the whole world, were consumed by want, were so hated by all as to be compelled to hide themselves in the coverts of wild beasts, and lastly, were drawn forth to endure savage and cruel tortures: and these last seemed wholly destitute of God&#8217;s 			 aid, when he thus exposed them to the pride and the cruelty of the ungodly. They seem then to have been very differently treated from the former ones; and yet faith ruled in both, and was alike powerful in both; nay, in the latter its power shone forth in a much clearer light. For the victory of faith appears more splendid in the contempt of death than if life were extended to the fifth generation. It is a more glorious evidence of faith, and worthy of higher praise, when reproaches, want, and 			 extreme troubles are borne with resignation and firmness, than when recovery from sickness is miraculously obtained, or any other benefit from God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.xi-p17"></A>The sum of the whole is, that the fortitude of the saints, which has shone forth in all ages, was the work of faith; for our weakness is such that we are not capable of overcoming evils, except faith sustains us. But we hence learn, that all who really trust in God are endued with power sufficient to resist Satan in whatever way he may assail them, and especially that patience in enduring evils shall never be wanting to us, if faith be 			 possessed; and that, therefore, we are proved guilty of unbelief when we faint under persecutions and the cross. For the nature of faith is the same now as in the days of the holy fathers whom the Apostle mentions.

 			  By<i> sheepskins</i> and <i>goatskins</i> I do not think that tents made of skins are meant, but the mean and rough clothing of the saints which they put on when wandering in deserts.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.xi-p21"></A>Now though they say that Jeremiah was stoned, that Isaiah was sawn asunder, and though sacred history relates that Elijah, Elisha, and other Prophets, wandered on mountains and in caves; yet I doubt not but he here points out those persecutions which Antiochus carried on against God&#8217;s people, and those which afterwards followed.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.xi-p22"></A><i>Not accepting deliverance,</i> <i>etc.</i> Most fitly does he speak here; for they must have purchased a short lease of life by denying God; but this would have been a price extremely shameful. That they might then live forever in heaven, they rejected a life on earth, which would have cost them, as we have said, so much as the denial of God, and also the 			 repudiation of their own calling. But we hear what Christ says, that if we seek to save our lives in this world, we shall lose them for ever. If, therefore, the real love of a future resurrection dwells in our hearts, it will easily lead us to the contempt of death. And doubtless we ought to live only so as to live to God: as soon as we are not permitted to live to God, we ought willingly and not reluctantly to meet death. Moreover, by this verse the Apostle confirms what he had said, that the 			 saints overcome all sufferings by faith; for except their minds had been sustained by the hope of a blessed resurrection, they must have immediately failed.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_238"><FONT SIZE="1">239</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.xi-p24"></A>We may hence also derive a needful encouragement, by which we may fortify ourselves in adversities. For we ought not to refuse the Lord&#8217;s favor of being connected with so many holy men, whom we know to have been exercised and tried by many sufferings. Here indeed are recorded, not the sufferings of a few individuals, but the common persecutions of the Church, and those not for one or two years, but such as continued sometimes from 			 grandfathers even to their grandchildren. No wonder, then, if it should please God to prove our faith at this day by similar trials; nor ought we to think that we are forsaken by him, who, we know, cared for the holy fathers who suffered the same before us.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_239"><FONT SIZE="1">240</FONT></A>

(<a name="xvii.xi-p27.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#032">Ge 18:32</a><a name="xvii.xi-p27.2"></A>.) Though then the world may cast out God&#8217;s servants as offscourings, it is yet to be regarded as one of its judgments that it cannot bear them; for there is ever accompanying them some blessing from God. Whenever the righteous are taken away from us, let us know that such events are presages of evil to us; for we are unworthy of having them with us, lest they should perish together with us.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.xi-p28"></A>At the same time the godly have abundant reasons for consolation, though the world may cast them out as offscourings; for they see that the same thing happened to the prophets, who found more clemency in wild animals than in men. It was with this thought that Hilary comforted himself when he saw the church taken possession of by sanguinary tyrants, who then employed the Roman emperor as their executioner; yea, that holy man then called to 			 mind what the Apostle here says of the Prophets; &#8212; &#8220;Mountains and forests,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and dungeons and prisons, are safer for me than splendid temples; for the Prophets, while abiding or buried in these, still prophesied by the Spirit of God.&#8221; So also ought we to be animated so as boldly to despise the world; and were it to cast us out, let us know that we go forth from a fatal gulf, and that God thus provides for our safety, so that we may not sink in the same destruction.</p>

<p><a name="xvii.xi-p30"></A><b>39.</b> <i>And these all,</i> <i>etc.</i> This is an argument from the less to the greater; for if they on whom the light of grace had not as yet so brightly shone displayed so great a constancy in enduring evils, what ought the full brightness of the Gospel to produce in us? A small spark of light led them to heaven; 			 when the sun of righteousness shines over us, with what pretense can we excuse ourselves if we still cleave to the earth? This is the real meaning of the Apostle.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_240"></A><A HREF="#fn_240"><FONT SIZE="1">241</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xvii.xi-p37"></A>I know that Chrysostom and others have given a different explanation, but the context clearly shows, that what is intended here is the difference in the grace which God bestowed on the faithful under the Law, and that which he bestows on us now. For since a more abundant grace is poured on us, it would be very strange that we should have less faith in us. He then says that those fathers who were endued with so remarkable a faith, had not yet 			 so strong reasons for believing as we have. Immediately after he states the reason, because God intended to unite us all into one body, and that he distributed a small portion of grace to them, that he might defer its full perfection to our time, even to the coming of Christ.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.xi-p38"></A>And it is a singular evidence of God&#8217;s benevolence towards us, that though he has shown himself bountifully to his children from the beginning of the world, he yet has so distributed his grace as to provide for the well&shy;being of the whole body. What more could any of us desire, than that in all the blessings which God bestowed on Abraham, Moses, David, and all the Patriarchs, on the Prophets and godly kings, he should have a regard for 			 us, so that we might be united together with them in the body of Christ? Let us then know that we are doubly and treble ungrateful to God, if less faith appears in us under the kingdom of Christ than the fathers had under the Law, as proved by so many remarkable examples of patience. By the words, that they received not the promise, is to be understood its ultimate fulfillment, which took place in Christ, on which subject something has been said already.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.i-p11"></A> The two words &#8220;substance&#8221; and &#8220;evidence&#8221; have been variously rendered, though the meaning continues materially the same: &#8220;substinance&#8221; and &#8220;demonstration&#8221; by Beza: &#8220;confident expectation&#8221; and &#8220;conviction&#8221; by Grotius and Doddridge: &#8220;confidence&#8221; and &#8220;evidence&#8221; by Macknight: &#8220;confidence&#8221; and &#8220;convincing evidence&#8221; by Stuart. When the primary meaning of words is suitable, there is no necessity of having recourse to what is secondary. The first word 				  means properly a foundation, a basis, a prop, a support: and what can be more appropriate here? Faith is the basis or the prop (as Calvin renders it in his exposition) of things hoped for; that is, faith is the foundation of hope; it is the fulcrum on which hope rests. The other word is properly &#8220;demonstration&#8221; a proof supported by reasons &#8212; what is made clear and evident. Conviction is the result of demonstration. So, then, the meaning is this &#8212; faith sustains hope, and exhibits to view things 				  unseen: it is the basis on which the objects of hope rest, and the demonstration or manifestation of what is not seen.</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.i-p12"></A>The word &#8220;substance&#8221; is derived from the Vulgate: though its etymological meaning corresponds with the original, yet its received meaning is quite different.

The universe, the whole visible creation, is what is 				  meant, as it appears from &#8220;seen&#8221; in the next clause: and the word &#945;&#7984;&#969;&#768;&#957;, in the singular number, says Stuart, is not employed to designate the &#8220;world&#8221; that is the universe. It is said to be used plurally to express the various parts of which the world is composed.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.ii-p19"></A>The verb &#8220;framed,&#8221; is rendered &#8220;compacted&#8221; by Beza &#8212; &#8220;adjusted&#8221; by Doddridge &#8212; &#8220;produced&#8221; by Macknight &#8212; and &#8220;formed&#8221; by Stuart.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.ii-p23"></A> Moderns no less than the ancients differ from Calvin as to this clause; and yet his explanation is more suited to the passage, and especially to &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8056; which means properly, to the end that, or, in order to, denoting the object or final cause. But there is no authority for making &#7952;&#954; and &#966;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#969;&#957; one word as he proposes: yet if the transposition of &#956;&#8052; be admitted, which both ancient and modern critics allow, the meaning advocated by Calvin may still be defended: &#8220;in order that of things not apparent there might be things visible;&#8221; the things not apparent or visible being the power, wisdom and goodness of God, in exact harmony with <a name="xvii.ii-p23.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020">Ro 1:20</a><a name="xvii.ii-p23.1"></A>, where God&#8217;s power and divinity are said to be &#8220;invisible things&#8221; &#8212; &#964;&#8048; &#7936;&#959;&#769;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#945;: they are things not apparent.</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.ii-p24"></A>Again, the verb &#954;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#961;&#964;&#8055;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; denotes not creation, but the fitting or adjusting, or setting in order of things previously created: it seems to designate the work done, not as described in the first verse of Genesis, but in the following verses: so that the object or design of this adjustment or arrangement is what is expressed in this clause; it was, that there might be visible 				  things as evidence or manifestations of things invisible.</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.ii-p25"></A>It may be further said, that the world is said to have been set in order by the word of God: and so it is recorded in Genesis: but this word or fiat is not mentioned in the first verse of that book, in which the heavens and the earth are said to have been created. It hence appears that the reference here is to the setting in order of this world, and not to the first creation of its materials; and if so, the second clause cannot refer to the 				  creation of the world out of nothing, as it is necessarily connected with what the first clause contains.</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.ii-p26"></A>&#8220;Faith&#8221; then refers here, if this view must be taken, not to the fact that the world was made by God, which even heathens admitted, but to the design of God in creation, the manifestation of his own glory. &#8220;The heavens,&#8221; says the Psalmist &#8220;declare the glory of God,&#8221; etc. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</p> 			 </P>

The word &#960;&#955;&#949;&#8055;&#969;&#957; is literally more, but is used in the sense 				  of more in number, quantity or excellency. The last is evidently the meaning here; for Abel&#8217;s offering, according to the account given, was not in the number or quantity, but in quality.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.ii-p35"></A> What the Apostle evidently refers to are these words, &#8220;the Lord had respect to Abel and to his offering.&#8221; He calls this &#8220;testifying.&#8221; How this was done, we are not told. The divine approbation was in some way conveyed; there was respect had to Abel and to his offering, but not to Cain nor to his offering. The Apostle says here first, that Abel &#8220;obtained a testimony that he was righteous,&#8221; and then he adds by way of explanation: God testifying of 				  his gifts. It seems then that the approbation of his gifts was the testimony he received that he was righteous, this was evidently the meaning of the Apostle. Now the question is, how was this testimony as to that sacrifice. What was it? Such, we may reasonably conclude as was given in other recorded instances; it was by fire sent from heaven to consume the sacrifice.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.iv-p9"></A> This is a very clear statement of the case of Noah. Many learned critics have given a different view, among moderns, Stuart and Dr. Bloomfield. The word rendered very correctly in our version, &#8220;being moved with fear,&#8221; they have rendered &#8220;with reverence&#8221; connecting it with &#8220;prepared.&#8221; The only other instance in which it occurs, it has the meaning of fear or dread, as to the consequences, see 				  <a name="xvii.iv-p9.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#010">Ac 23:10</a><a name="xvii.iv-p9.1"></A>. Besides, the whole tenor of the passage comports with this meaning: what was the warning? It was that of a dreadful judgment; and how is judgment to be regarded, but with fear? Faith, as Calvin will tell us presently, regards judgments as well as promises. Men are exhorted to flee from the wrath to come: when they believe that there is a wrath to come, do not they fear? Doddridge and Scott coincide 				  with Calvin.</p>

Stuart refers &#8220;which&#8221; to faith, while it ought evidently to be referred to the ark; Noah by building the ark which he did by faith, condemned the conduct of others in neglecting to 				  provide for the coming destruction.

Besides, the idea is somewhat different. There are thus two things in the verse stated more directly, as evidences and proofs of faith, &#8212; his departure from his own country, and his ignorance as to the country where he was going. His faith was such that he obeyed, so as to leave his own country, and also to go to a country, of which he knew nothing. &#8212; <i>Ed</i></p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.vii-p26"></A> The meaning given by Stuart and some others is very far fetched, though said to be natural, that &#8220;Abraham believed that God could raise Isaac from the dead, because he had, as it were, obtained him from the dead, i.e., he was born of those who were dead as to these things.&#8221; Hence the rendering given is &#8220;comparatively.&#8221; Abraham had, as to his purpose, sacrificed him, so that he considered him as dead; and he received him back from the dead, not 				  really, but in a way bearing a likeness to such a miracle. This sense is alone compatible with the former clause, which mentions Abraham&#8217;s faith in God&#8217;s power to raise his son from the dead; he believed that God was able to do this; and then it is added that Abraham had received back his son as though he had sacrificed him, and as though God had raised him from the dead. What actually took place bore a likeness to the way which he had anticipated.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.vii-p34"></A> The points are of no authority; and the Apostle adopted the Septuagint version, and thus sanctioned it: and there is no reason to dispute that sanction.

The latter is the most suitable meaning here; and the words may be rendered &#8220;executed justice.&#8221; Samuel was an example of this.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.xi-p20"></A> This conjecture not countenanced by any MSS. that are considered to have much weight. What has led to this conjecture has evidently been a misunderstanding as to the import of the word in this connection. Being a word of general import, it has been viewed as inappropriate here among words of specified meaning: it refers to the temptation or trial to which those who were condemned for their religion were commonly exposed &#8212; the offer of life and 				  of favors and recantation: that seems to have been the special temptation here intended. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.xi-p23"></A> The verse concludes with these words &#8220;that they might obtain a better resurrection,&#8221; &#8212; better than what? Better than the resurrection referred to at the beginning of the verse, when it is said that &#8220;women received their dead raised to life again;&#8221; or better than the life promised by persecutors to those doomed to die, in case they renounced their religion. The former is the view taken by Scott and Stuart, and the latter by Doddridge: but as 				  deliverance and no deliverance are facts in contrast, the first is the most obvious meaning.&#8212;<i>Ed</i>.</p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.xi-p25"></A> The conclusion of the 37th verse is, &#8220;being destitute, afflicted, tormented:&#8221; this is said of those who &#8220;wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins.&#8221; They were destitute, they had been oppressed or persecuted and unjustly dealt with. Wrong treatment and oppression or persecution drove them from there homes and destitution followed. This is the way in which things are often stated in Scripture; the effect or the present 				  state first, and then the cause or what led to it. The words are rendered &#8220;destitute, afflicted, maltreated,&#8221; by Macknight, &#8212; and &#8220;suffering want, afflicted, injuriously treated,&#8221; by Stuart. The second word often means oppression or persecution. The third word is found only here and <a name="xvii.xi-p25.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#002">Heb 13:2</a><a name="xvii.xi-p25.1"></A> where it is rendered &#8220;suffer adversity.&#8221; It is found in the Sept., in 				  <a name="xvii.xi-p25.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026">1Ki 2:26</a><a name="xvii.xi-p25.2"></A>, twice and <a name="xvii.xi-p25.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#039">1Ki 11:39</a><a name="xvii.xi-p25.3"></A>. It is used by Aqula in <a name="xvii.xi-p25.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#022">Ex 22:22</a><a name="xvii.xi-p25.4"></A>, and in <a name="xvii.xi-p25.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#023">Job 37:23</a><a name="xvii.xi-p25.5"></A>.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.xi-p31"></A> This is materially the view taken by Beza, Doddridge, Scott and Stuart. The &#8220;promise&#8221; is deemed to be especially that of Christ. The ancients heard of him, believed in his coming, but did not witness it. The &#8220;some better thing&#8221; is considered to be the same with the promise, or to be the Gospel as revealed, or in the words of Stuart, &#8220;the actual fulfillment of the promise respecting the Messiah.&#8221;</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.xi-p32"></A>Still there is something unsatisfactory in this view as to &#8220;the promise,&#8221; as Stuart seems to intimate. There are two verses, <a name="xvii.xi-p32.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036">Heb. 10:36</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015">Heb. 9:15</a><a name="xvii.xi-p32.1"></A>, which seem to throw light on this subject: by the first we find that &#8220;the promise&#8221; is future to us as well as to the ancient saints; and by the second, that &#8220;the better thing&#8221; is the 				  atoning death of Christ, which was to the ancient saints an unfulfilled event, but to us fulfilled and clearly revealed, and yet its benefits extended to them as well as to us.</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.xi-p33"></A>The &#8220;promise&#8221; throughout this Epistle is that of &#8220;the eternal inheritance&#8221; and &#8220;the promises&#8221; in <a name="xvii.xi-p33.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013">Heb 11:13</a><a name="xvii.xi-p33.1"></A> include this and others, and especially &#8220;the better things,&#8221; that is the Gospel, or fulfillment of what was necessary to attain the inheritance, even the death and resurrection of Christ; or we may say that it is &#8220;the better hope,&#8221; (<a name="xvii.xi-p33.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019">Heb 7:19</a><a name="xvii.xi-p33.2"></A>) or the &#8220;better covenant, which was established on better promises,&#8221; (<a name="xvii.xi-p33.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006">Heb 8:6</a><a name="xvii.xi-p33.3"></A>.) The verses may be thus rendered &#8212;</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.xi-p34"></A>&#8220;And all these, having obtained a good report through faith, have not received the promise: 40. God having foreordained as to us something more excellent, so that they without us might not be perfected;&#8221; that is, in body as well as in soul.</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.xi-p35"></A>The sentiment seems to be this, &#8212; &#8220;the ancient saints believed God&#8217;s promise, respecting an eternal inheritance after the resurrection: they died in hope of this, they have not yet obtained it, and for this reason, because God had designed to fulfill to us what he had also promised to them, even the coming of a Redeemer; it is necessary that this more excellent thing than what had in this world been vouchsafed to them, should take place, as on it 				  depended everything connected with the promise of the &#8216;heavenly city:&#8217; so that without the more excellent thing fulfilled to us, their perfect state, in body as well as in soul, was not to be attained.&#8221;</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.xi-p36"></A>Their souls are perfect, for we as Christians are said to have come &#8220;to the spirits of just men made perfect,&#8221; (<a name="xvii.xi-p36.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023">Heb 12:23</a><a name="xvii.xi-p36.1"></A>;) they who die in the Lord are said to &#8220;rest from their labors,&#8221; and are pronounced blessed or happy. (<a name="xvii.xi-p36.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013">Re 14:13</a><a name="xvii.xi-p36.2"></A>.) But they are not in possession 				  of the inheritance promised them, neither the ancients nor those who now die in the Lord.The promise as to both will not be fulfilled until the glorious day of the resurrection. Then all the saints, whether before or after the coming of Christ, will at the same time, with pure and immortal bodies, united to pure spirits, be together introduced into their eternal inheritance which he promised to Abraham and his seed, when he said that he would be their God. Christ referred to that declaration as 				  an evidence of the resurrection. (<a name="xvii.xi-p36.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#037">Lu 20:37</a><a name="xvii.xi-p36.3"></A>.) Then the Patriarchs believed that there would be a resurrection. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>
