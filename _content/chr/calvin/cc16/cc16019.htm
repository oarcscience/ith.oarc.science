<p><a name="xx.i-p3"></A><b>1 </b>Hear me, O islands! And hearken, ye peoples from afar. Jehovah hath called me from the womb; From my mothers belly he hath had my name in remembrance.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p4"></A><b>2 </b>And he hath placed nay mouth like a sharp sword; In the shadow of his hand he hath protected me, And hath placed me as a polished arrow; in his quiver hath he hid me;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And said to me, Thou art my servant, O Israel! In thee will I he glorified.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p6"></A><b>4 </b>But I said, In vain have I toiled; Uselessly And unprofitably have I exhausted my strength; and my judgment is before Jehovah; And my work before my God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p7"></A><b>5 </b>And now saith Jehovah, Who formed me from the womb to be his servant, That I may bring back Jacob to him: And though Israel be not gathered, Yet I shall be glorious in the eyes of Jehovah, And my God shall be my strength.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p8"></A><b>6 </b>And he saith, It is a light thing that thou shouldst be my servant, To raise up the tribes of Jacob, And that thou shouldst restore the desolations of Israel; Therefore have I appointed thee to be a light of the Gentiles, That thou mayest be my salvation to the end of the earth.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, The Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, To the contemptible in the soul, To the abhorred nation, To the servant of rulers; Kings shall see, And princes shall arise, And shall worship for the sake of Jehovah; For faithful is the Holy One of Israel, who hath chosen thee.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p10"></A><b>8 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, In a time of good-pleasure have I listened to thee; In the day of salvation have I assisted thee; And I will preserve thee. And give thee for a covenant of the people, That thou mayest raise up the earth, That thou mayest possess by inheritance the desolate heritages;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p11"></A><b>9 </b>That thou mayest say to them that are bound, Go forth! To them that are in darkness, Show yourselves. On the ways they shall feed; On all the high places shall be their pastures.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p12"></A><b>10 </b>They shall not hunger nor thirst; The heat And the sun shall not smite them; For he that hath compassion on them shall guide them; And by the fountains of waters shall he lead them.</p>

<p><a name="xx.i-p30"></A><b>25 </b>Yet thus saith Jehovah; Even the captivity of the mighty shall be taken away, And the prey of the tyrant shall be delivered; For I will contend with him who contendeth with thee, And I will save thy children.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p31"></A><b>26 </b>And I will feed thy spoilers with their own flesh, And they shall be made drunk with their own blood as with new wine; And all flesh shall know that I am Jehovah, Thy Savior And thy Redeemer, The Mighty One of Jacob.</p>  <a name="xx.ii"></A>

<p><a name="xx.ii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Why came I, And no mall (met me)? Called I, And no man answered? By shortening hath my hand been shortened, So that it cannot redeem? Is there not in me power to deliver? Behold! by my rebuke I dry up the sea; I put rivers in the wilderness, So that their fishes purify for want of water, And die for thirst.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>I clothe the heavens with blackness, And make their covering like sackcloth.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of the learned, That I may know a word in season to the weary. In the morning will he awaken, In the morning will he awaken mine ear, That I may hear as the learned.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>The Lord Jehovah hath opened mine ear, And I was not rebellious: I did not turn back.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>I exposed my body to the smiters, And my cheeks to them that tore me; My face I did not hide from shame And spitting.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>For the Lord Jehovah will assist me; Therefore I was not ashamed; Therefore have I set my time as a flint; And I know that I shall not be confounded.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>He is near that justifieth me: Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together: Who is the opponent of my cause? Let him draw near to me.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Behold! the Lord Jehovah will assist me; Who is he that shall condemn me? Behold! all shall wax old as a garment; The moth shall consume them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Who is there among you that feareth Jehovah? Let him hear the voice of his servant. He who hath walked in darkness, And hath had no light; Let him trust in the name of Jehovah, And rely on his God.</p>

<p><a name="xx.iii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Surely Jehovah will comfort Zion; He will comfort all her desolations; And he will make her desert like a place of delights, And her wilderness like the garden of Jehovah: Gladness And joy shall be found in her; Confession And the voice of a song.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Attend to me, my people; And listen to me, my nation; For the law shall go forth from me; And I will reveal my judgment for a light of the peoples.</p>

<p><a name="xx.iii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Lift up your eyes toward heaven, And look upon the earth beneath; For the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, And the earth shall wax old like a garment, And its inhabitants shall perish in the same manner; But my salvation shall endure for ever. And my righteousness shall not perish.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Hearken to me, ye that know righteousness; A people in whose heart is my law. Fear ye not the reproach of men, And be not discouraged by their slander.</p>
