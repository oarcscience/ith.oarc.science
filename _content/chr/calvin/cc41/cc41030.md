<span id="vi.iv-p2"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="vi.iv-p3"></span>**1** I therefore, a prisoner in the Lord,
beseech you, that ye may walk worthy of the calling to which ye have
been called,

<span id="vi.iv-p4"></span>**2** With all humility and meekness, with
patience forbearing one another in love,

<span id="vi.iv-p5"></span>**3** Endeavoring to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace.

<span id="vi.iv-p6"></span>**4** One body and one spirit;  <span
id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218) as ye have been called in one hope of
your calling.

<span id="vi.iv-p8"></span>**5** One Lord  <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219) one faith, one baptism.

<span id="vi.iv-p10"></span>**6** One God and Father of all, who is
above all things, and through all things, *(or, above all men and
through all men,)* and in you all.

<span id="vi.iv-p11"></span>**7** But to each of us hath grace been
given, according to the measure of the gift of Christ.

<span id="vi.iv-p12"></span>**8** Wherefore he saith: After having
ascended on high, he led captivity captive  <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220) and gave gifts to men. (<span
id="vi.iv-p13.2"></span>[Ps 68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018)<span
id="vi.iv-p13.2"></span>.)

<span id="vi.iv-p14"></span>**9** Now that (word) he ascended, what is
it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?

<span id="vi.iv-p15"></span>**10** He who descended is the same also who
ascended above all heavens, that he might fill all things.  <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221)

<span id="vi.iv-p17"></span>**11** And he gave some apostles, and some
prophets, and some evangelists, and others pastors and teachers,

<span id="vi.iv-p18"></span>**12** For the renewing of the saints, for
the work of the ministry, for the edification of the body of Christ;

<span id="vi.iv-p19"></span>**13** Till we all come into the unity of
the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, into a perfect man,
into the measure of the age of fulness  <span
id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222) of Christ;

<span id="vi.iv-p21"></span>**14** That we may no longer be children,
who are tossed and driven about by every wind of doctrine, by the
cunning of men, by craftiness for lying in wait to deceive;

<span id="vi.iv-p22"></span>**15** But, following truth with love, may
grow up in all things into him who is the head, that is, Christ;

<span id="vi.iv-p23"></span>**16** From whom the whole body fitly joined
together and compacted by every joint of supply, according to the
efficacy in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body, to
the edifying of itself, in love.

<span id="vi.iv-p24"></span>**17** This I say, therefore, and testify in
the Lord, that ye no longer walk, as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity
of their mind,

<span id="vi.iv-p25"></span>**18** Blinded in the understanding,
alienated from the life of God on account of the ignorance which is in
them, on account of the blindness of their heart;

<span id="vi.iv-p26"></span>**19** Who, after having ceased to have any
feeling,  <span id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223) have given themselves
up to lasciviousness, to commit all uncleanness with greediness.

<span id="vi.iv-p28"></span>**20** But ye have not so learned Christ;

<span id="vi.iv-p29"></span>**21** If indeed ye have heard him, and have
been taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus;

<span id="vi.iv-p30"></span>**22** That ye put off, according to the
former conversation, the old man, which is corrupted according to the
lusts of deceit;  <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224)

<span id="vi.iv-p32"></span>**23** And that ye be renewed in the spirit
of your mind;

<span id="vi.iv-p33"></span>**24** And that ye put on the new man, which
hath been created according to God, in righteousness and holiness of
truth.  <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225)

<span id="vi.iv-p35"></span>**25** Wherefore, putting away lying, speak
every one the truth with his neighbor;

<span id="vi.iv-p36"></span>**26** For we are members one of another.

<span id="vi.iv-p37"></span>**27** Be ye angry, and do not sin. (<span
id="vi.iv-p37.1"></span>[Ps 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004)<span
id="vi.iv-p37.1"></span>.) Let not the sun go down on your wrath; and
give not place to the devil.

<span id="vi.iv-p38"></span>**28** He that stole, let him steal no more;
but rather let him labor, by working with his hands what is good, that
he may have to give to him that needeth.

<span id="vi.iv-p39"></span>**29** Let no filthy speech proceed out of
your mouth; but if any (speech) is good for the edification of use, that
it may impart grace to the hearers.

<span id="vi.iv-p40"></span>**30** And grieve not the Holy Spirit of
God, by whom ye have been sealed to the day of redemption.

<span id="vi.iv-p41"></span>**31** Let all bitterness, and anger, and
wrath, and clamour, and slander, be put away from you with all malice.

<span id="vi.iv-p42"></span>**32** And be ye kind one to another,
merciful, forgiving one another, as God hath forgiven you in Christ.
