<span id="v.vi-p2"></span>CHAPTER 6

<span id="v.vi-p3"></span>**1** Brethren, although a man be overtaken in
any fault, ye, who are spiritual, restore such a man in the spirit of
meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

<span id="v.vi-p4"></span>**2** Bear ye one another’s burdens, and thus
fulfill the law of Christ.

<span id="v.vi-p5"></span>**3** For if any one thinketh himself to be
something, though he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.

<span id="v.vi-p6"></span>**4** But let every one prove his own work;
and then shall he have glory in himself alone, and not in another.
 <span id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197)

<span id="v.vi-p8"></span>**5** For every one shall bear his own burden.

<span id="v.vi-p9"></span>**6** Let him who is taught in the word
communicate to the teacher in all good things.

<span id="v.vi-p10"></span>**7** Do not mistake: God is not mocked; for
what a man shall have sowed, that will he also reap.

<span id="v.vi-p11"></span>**8** For he who soweth to his flesh, shall
of the flesh reap corruption; but he who soweth to the Spirit, shall of
the Spirit reap everlasting life.

<span id="v.vi-p12"></span>**9** And let us not weary in doing good; for
if we do not faint, we shall reap in due time.  <span
id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198)

<span id="v.vi-p14"></span>**10** Therefore, while we have opportunity,
let us do good to all, but especially to them who are of the household
of faith.

<span id="v.vi-p15"></span>**11** Ye see what a letter  <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199) I have written with my own hand.

<span id="v.vi-p17"></span>**12** As many as wish to please outwardly in
the flesh,  <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200) they constrain you
to be circumcised; only that they may not suffer persecution for the
cross of Christ.

<span id="v.vi-p19"></span>**13** For neither they who hold by
circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they wish you to be
circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.

<span id="v.vi-p20"></span>**14** But far be it from me to glory, unless
in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world is crucified
to me, and I to the world.

<span id="v.vi-p21"></span>**15** For in Christ Jesus neither
circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision; but a new creature.

<span id="v.vi-p22"></span>**16** And as many as walk by this rule,
peace (be) on them, and mercy, and on the Israel of God.

<span id="v.vi-p23"></span>**17** Henceforth let no man give me
annoyance; for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.

<span id="v.vi-p24"></span>**18** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
(be) with your spirit. Amen.

<span id="v.vi-p25"></span>TO THE GALATIANS IT WAS WRITTEN FROM ROME.
