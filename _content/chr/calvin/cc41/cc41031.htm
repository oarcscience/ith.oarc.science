<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref08"><a name="vi.v-p2"></A>CHAPTER 5</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p3"></A><b>1 </b>Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p4"></A><b>2 </b>And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and sacrifice to God, for a smell of delightful fragrance.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p5"></A><b>3 </b>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let them not even be named among you, as becometh saints.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Or filthiness, foolish talking, jesting; which are not convenient; but rather grace.   	 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_226"><FONT SIZE="1">227</FONT></A>
</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p8"></A><b>5 </b>For this ye know, that no fornicator, or unclean person, or covetous man, who is an idolater, shall obtain inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p9"></A><b>6 </b>Let no man deceive you by vain words; for on account of these things cometh the wrath of God on disobedient <i>(or, unbelieving) </i>children,   	 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_227"></A><A HREF="#fn_227"><FONT SIZE="1">228</FONT></A>
</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p11"></A><b>7 </b>Be not ye therefore their companions.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p12"></A><b>8 </b>Ye were once darkness; but now ye are light in the Lord; walk as children of light;</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p13"></A><b>9 </b>(For the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth;)</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p14"></A><b>10 </b>Proving what is acceptable to God.   	 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_228"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">229</FONT></A>
</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p16"></A><b>11 </b>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; but rather reprove them.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p17"></A><b>12 </b>For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p18"></A><b>13 </b>But all things, when they are brought forward, are made manifest by the light; for every thing that maketh manifest is light.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p19"></A><b>14 </b>Wherefore he saith: Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead; and Christ shall give thee light.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p20"></A><b>15 </b>See then how you walk carefully, not as fools, but as wise;</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p21"></A><b>16 </b>Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p22"></A><b>17 </b>Wherefore be ye not imprudent, but understanding what is the will of the Lord.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p23"></A><b>18 </b>And be not drunk with wine, in which is lasciviousness;</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p24"></A><b>19 </b>But be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart, to the Lord;</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p25"></A><b>20 </b>Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p26"></A><b>21 </b>Submit yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ <i>(or, of God). </i></p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p27"></A><b>22 </b>Let wives be subject to their own husbands as to the Lord;</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p28"></A><b>23 </b>For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the savior of the church; and he is the savior of the body.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p29"></A><b>24 </b>But, as the church is subject to Christ, in like manner (let) wives (be subject) to their own husbands in all things.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p30"></A><b>25 </b>Husbands, love your wives; as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it,</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p31"></A><b>26 </b>That he might sanctify it, cleansing it with the washing of water by the word;</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p32"></A><b>27 </b>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it might be holy and unblamable.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p33"></A><b>28 </b>So ought husbands to love their wives, as their own bodies. He who loveth his wife loveth himself.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p34"></A><b>29 </b>For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it; as also Christ   	 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_229"></A><A HREF="#fn_229"><FONT SIZE="1">230</FONT></A>
 	  the church;</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p36"></A><b>30 </b>For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p37"></A><b>31 </b>For this reason shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p38"></A><b>32 </b>This is a great secret; but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.v-p39"></A><b>33 </b>Yet let every one of you love his wife; and let the woman reverence her husband.</p>
