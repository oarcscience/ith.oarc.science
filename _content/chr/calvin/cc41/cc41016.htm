<p><a name="iv.v.i-p16"></A>The three remaining chapters consist entirely of practical exhortations. Mutual agreement is the first subject, in the course of which a discussion is introduced respecting the government of the church, as having been framed by our Lord for the purpose of maintaining unity among Christians.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p17"></A><b>1.</b> <i>I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord.</i> His imprisonment, which might have been supposed more likely to render him despised, is appealed to, as we have already seen, for a confirmation of his authority. It was the seal of that embassy with which he had been honored. Whatever belongs to Christ, though in the eyes of men it may be attended by 		ignominy, ought to be viewed by us with the highest regard. The apostle&#8217;s prison is more truly venerable than the splendid retinue or triumphal chariot of kings.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p18"></A><i>That ye may walk worthy.</i> This is a general sentiment, a sort of preface, on which all the following statements are founded. He had formerly illustrated <i>the calling with which they were called, </i>  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">138</FONT></A>
 		 and now reminds them that they must live in obedience to God, in order that they may not be unworthy of such distinguished grace.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v.i-p20"></A><a name="iv.v.i-p20.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p21"></A><b>2.</b> <i>With all humility</i>. He now descends to particulars, and first of all he mentions <i>humility</i>  The reason is, that he was about to enter on the subject of Unity, to which humility is the first step. This again produces <i>meekness,</i> 		which disposes us to bear with our brethren, and thus to preserve that unity which would otherwise be broken a hundred times in a day. Let us remember, therefore, that, in cultivating brotherly kindness, we must begin with humility. Whence come rudeness, pride, and disdainful language towards brethren? Whence come quarrels, insults, and reproaches? Come they not from this, that every one carries his love of himself, and his regard to his own interests, to excess? By laying aside haughtiness and 		a desire of pleasing ourselves, we shall become meek and gentle, and acquire that moderation of temper which will overlook and forgive many things in the conduct of our brethren. Let us carefully observe the order and arrangement of these exhortations. It will be to no purpose that we inculcate forbearance till the natural fierceness has been subdued, and mildness acquired; and it will be equally vain to discourse of <i>meekness,</i> till we have begun 		with <i>humility.</i></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p22"></A><i>Forbearing one another in love.</i> This agrees with what is elsewhere taught, that &#8220;love suffereth long and is kind.&#8221; (<a name="iv.v.i-p22.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#004">1Co 13:4</a><a name="iv.v.i-p22.1"></A>.) Where love is strong 		and prevalent, we shall perform many acts of mutual forbearance.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v.i-p23"></A><a name="iv.v.i-p23.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p24"></A><b>3.</b><i> Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit.</i> With good reason does he recommend forbearance, as tending to promote the unity of the Spirit. Innumerable offenses arise daily, which might produce quarrels, particularly when we consider the extreme bitterness of man&#8217;s natural temper. Some consider <i>the unity of the Spirit</i> to 		mean that spiritual unity which is produced in us by the Spirit of God. There can be no doubt that He alone makes us &#8220;of one accord, of one mind,&#8221; (<a name="iv.v.i-p24.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002">Php 2:2</a><a name="iv.v.i-p24.1"></A>,) and thus makes us one; but I think it more natural to understand the words as denoting harmony 		of views. This unity, he tells us, is maintained by <i>the bond of peace;</i> for disputes frequently give rise to hatred and resentment. We must live at peace, if we would wish that brotherly kindness should be permanent amongst us.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v.i-p25"></A><a name="iv.v.i-p25.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p26"></A><b>4.</b> <i>There is one body.</i>   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">139</FONT></A>
 		 He proceeds to show more fully in how complete a manner Christians ought to be united. The union ought to be such that we shall form <i>one body and one soul.</i> These words denote the whole man. We ought to be united, not in part only, but in body and soul. He supports this by a powerful argument, <i>as ye have been called in one hope of your calling.</i> We are called to one 		inheritance and one life; and hence it follows, that we cannot obtain eternal life without living in mutual harmony in this world. One Divine invitation being addressed to all, they ought to be united in the same profession of faith, and to render every kind of assistance to each other. Oh, were this thought deeply impressed upon our minds, that we are subject to a law which no more permits the children of God to differ among themselves than the kingdom of heaven to be divided, how earnestly 		should we cultivate brotherly kindness! How should we dread every kind of animosity, if we duly reflected that all who separate us from brethren, estrange us from the kingdom of God! And yet, strangely enough, while we forget the duties which brethren owe to each other, we go on boasting that we are the sons of God. Let us learn from Paul, that none are at all fit for that inheritance who are not one body and one spirit.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v.i-p28"></A><a name="iv.v.i-p28.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p29"></A><b>5.</b> <i>One Lord.</i> In the first Epistle to the Corinthians, he employs the word <i>Lord,</i> to denote simply the government of God.</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.v.i-p30"></A>&#8220;There are differences of administration, but the same Lord.&#8221;<br> 		(<a name="iv.v.i-p30.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#005">1Co 12:5</a><a name="iv.v.i-p30.2"></A>)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p31"></A>In the present instance, as he shortly afterwards makes express mention of the Father, he gives this appellation strictly to Christ, who has been appointed by the Father to be <i>our Lord,</i> and to whose government we cannot be subject, unless we are of one mind. The frequent repetition of the word <i>one</i> is 		emphatic. <i>Christ</i> cannot be divided. <i>Faith</i> cannot be rent. There are not various <i>baptisms,</i> but one which is common to all. <i>God</i> cannot cease to be <i>one,</i> and unchangeable. It cannot but be our duty to cherish holy unity, which 		is bound by so many ties. Faith, and baptism, and God the Father, and Christ, ought to unite us, so as almost to become one man. All these arguments for unity deserve to be pondered, but cannot be fully explained. I reckon it enough to take a rapid glance at the apostle&#8217;s meaning, leaving the full illustration of it to the preachers of the gospel. The unity of <i>faith,</i> which is here mentioned, depends on the one, eternal truth of God, on which it 		is founded.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p32"></A><i>One baptism,</i> This does not mean that Christian baptism is not to be administered more than once, but that one baptism is common to all; so that, by means of it, we begin to form one body and one soul. But if that argument has any force, a much stronger one will be founded on the truth, that the Father, and Son, and Spirit, are one God; for it is one baptism, which is celebrated in the name of the 		Three Persons. What reply will the Arians or Sabellians make to this argument? Baptism possesses such force as to make us one; and in baptism, the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Spirit, is invoked. Will they deny that one Godhead is the foundation of this holy and mysterious unity? We are compelled to acknowledge, that the ordinance of baptism proves the existence of Three Persons in one Divine essence.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v.i-p33"></A><a name="iv.v.i-p33.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p34"></A><b>6.</b> <i>One God and Father of all.</i> This is the main argument, from which all the rest flow. How comes it that we are united by faith, by baptism, or even by the government of Christ, but because God the Father, extending to each of us his gracious presence, employs these means for gathering us to himself? The two phrases, &#7952;&#960;&#8054; 		&#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#953;&#8048; &#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;, may either mean, <i>above all and through all</i> Things, or <i>above all</i> <i>and through all</i> Men. Either meaning will apply sufficiently well, or rather, in both cases, the meaning will be the same. Although God by 		his power upholds, and maintains, and rules, all things, yet Paul is not now speaking of the universal, but of the spiritual government which belongs to the church. By the Spirit of sanctification, God spreads himself through all the members of the church, embraces all in his government, and dwells in all; but God is not inconsistent with himself, and therefore we cannot but be united to him into one body.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p35"></A>This spiritual unity is mentioned by our Lord.</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.v.i-p36"></A>&#8220;Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast, given me, that they may be one as we are.&#8221;<br> 		(<a name="iv.v.i-p36.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#011">Joh 17:11</a><a name="iv.v.i-p36.2"></A>)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.i-p37"></A>This is true indeed, in a general sense, not only of all men but of all creatures. &#8220;In him we live, and move, and have our being.&#8221; (<a name="iv.v.i-p37.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028">Ac 17:28</a><a name="iv.v.i-p37.1"></A>.) And again, &#8220;Do not I fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord?&#8221; (<a name="iv.v.i-p37.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#024">Jer 23:24</a><a name="iv.v.i-p37.2"></A>.) But we must attend to the connection in which this passage stands. Paul is now illustrating the mutual relation of believers, which has nothing in common either with wicked men or with inferior animals. To this relation we must 		limit what is said about God&#8217;s government and presence. It is for this reason, also, that the apostle uses the word <i>Father,</i> which applies only to the members of Christ.</p>  <a name="iv.v.ii"></A>

<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p8"></A><b>10.</b> He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)</p>

<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v.ii-p11"></A><a name="iv.v.ii-p11.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p12"></A><b>7.</b> <i>But to every one. </i>He now describes the manner in which God establishes and preserves among us a mutual relation. No member of the body of Christ is endowed with such perfection as to be able, without the assistance of others, to supply his own necessities. A certain proportion is allotted to each; and it is only by communicating with each other, 		that all enjoy what is sufficient for maintaining their respective places in the body. The diversity of gifts is discussed in another Epistle, and very nearly with the same object.</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.v.ii-p13"></A>&#8220;There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit&#8221;<br> 		(<a name="iv.v.ii-p13.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004">1Co 12:4</a><a name="iv.v.ii-p13.2"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p14"></A>Such a diversity, we are there taught, is so far from injuring, that it tends to promote and strengthen, the harmony of believers.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p15"></A>The meaning of this verse may be thus summed up. &#8220;On no one has God bestowed all things. Each has received a certain measure. Being thus dependent on each other, they find it necessary to throw their individual gifts into the common stock, and thus to render mutual aid.&#8221; The words <i>grace</i> and <i>gift</i> remind us that, whatever may be our attainments, we ought not to be proud of them, because they lay us under deeper obligations to God. These blessings are said to be <i>the gift of Christ;</i> for, as the apostle, first of all, mentioned the Father, so his aim, as we shall see, is to represent all that we are, and all that we have, as gathered together in 		Christ.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v.ii-p16"></A><a name="iv.v.ii-p16.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p17"></A><b>8.</b> <i>Therefore he saith.</i> To serve the purpose of his argument, Paul has departed not a little from the true meaning of this quotation. Wicked men charge him with having made an unfair use of Scripture. The Jews go still farther, and, for the sake of giving to their accusations a greater air of plausibility, maliciously pervert the natural meaning of 		this passage. What is said of God, is applied by them to David or to the people. &#8220;David, or the people,&#8221; they say, &#8220;ascended on high, when, in consequence of many victories, they rose superior to their enemies.&#8221; But a careful examination of the Psalm will convince any reader that the words, 		<i>he ascended up on high,</i> are applied strictly to God alone.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p18"></A>The whole Psalm may be regarded as an &#7952;&#960;&#8055;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#953;&#959;&#957;, a song of triumph, which David sings to God on account of the victories which he had obtained; but, taking occasion from the narrative of his own exploits, he makes a passing survey of the astonishing deliverances which the Lord had formerly wrought for his people. His object is to shew, that we ought to contemplate in the 		history of the Church the glorious power and goodness of God; and among other things he says, <i>Thou hast ascended on high.</i> (<a name="iv.v.ii-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018">Ps 68:18</a><a name="iv.v.ii-p18.1"></A>.) The flesh is apt to imagine that God remains idle and asleep, when he does not openly execute his judgments. To the view of men, when the Church is oppressed, God is in some manner humbled; but, when 		he stretches out his avenging arm for her deliverance, he then appears to rouse himself, and to ascend his throne of judgment.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p19"></A>&#8220;Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts; he put them to a perpetual reproach.&#8221;<br> 		(<a name="iv.v.ii-p19.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#065">Ps. 78:65</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#066">66</a><a name="iv.v.ii-p19.2"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p20"></A>This mode of expression is sufficiently common and familiar; and, in short, the deliverance of the Church is here called the <i>ascension</i> of God.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p21"></A>Perceiving that it is a song of triumph, in which David celebrates all the victories which God had wrought for the salvation of his Church, Paul very properly quoted the account given of God&#8217;s ascension, and applied it to the person of Christ. The noblest triumph which God ever gained was when Christ, after subduing sin, conquering death, and putting Satan to flight, rose majestically to heaven, that he might exercise his glorious reign 		over the Church. Hitherto there is no ground for the objection, that Paul has applied this quotation in a manner inconsistent with the design of the Psalmist. The continued existence of the Church is represented by David to be a manifestation of the Divine glory. But no ascension of God more triumphant or memorable will ever occur, than that which took place when Christ was carried up to the right hand of the Father, that he might rule over all authorities and powers, and might become the 		everlasting guardian and protector of his people.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p22"></A><i>He led captivity captive.</i> <i>Captivity</i> is a collective noun for <i>captive enemies;</i> and the plain meaning is, that God reduced his enemies to subjection, which was more fully accomplished in Christ than in any other way. He has not only gained a complete victory over the devil, 		and sin, and death, and all the power of hell, &#8212; but out of rebels he forms every day &#8220;a willing people,&#8221; (<a name="iv.v.ii-p22.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003">Ps 110:3</a><a name="iv.v.ii-p22.1"></A>,) when he subdues by his word the obstinacy of our flesh. On the other hand, his enemies &#8212; to which class all wicked men belong &#8212; are held bound by chains of iron, and are restrained by his power from exerting their 		fury beyond the limits which he shall assign.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p23"></A><i>And gave gifts to men.</i> There is rather more difficulty in this clause; for the words of the Psalm are, &#8220;thou hast <i>received</i> gifts for men,&#8221; while the apostle changes this expression into <i>gave gifts,</i> 		and thus appears to exhibit an opposite meaning. Still there is no absurdity here; for Paul does not always quote the exact words of Scripture, but, after referring to the passage, satisfies himself with conveying the substance of it in his own language. Now, it is clear that the <i>gifts</i> which David mentions were not <i>received</i> by God for himself, but for his people; and accordingly we are told, in 		an earlier part of the Psalm, that &#8220;the spoil&#8221; had been &#8220;divided&#8221; among the families of Israel. (<a name="iv.v.ii-p23.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#012">Ps 68:12</a><a name="iv.v.ii-p23.1"></A>.) Since therefore the intention of <i>receiving</i> was to <i>give</i> gifts, Paul can hardly be said to have departed from the substance, whatever alteration there may be in the words.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p24"></A>At the same time, I am inclined to a different opinion, that Paul purposely changed the word, and employed it, not as taken out of the Psalm, but as an expression of his own, adapted to the present occasion. Having quoted from the Psalm a few words descriptive of Christ&#8217;s ascension, he adds, in his own language, <i>and gave gifts,</i> &#8212; for the purpose of drawing a comparison 		between the greater and the less. Paul intends to shew, that this ascension of God in the person of Christ was far more illustrious than the ancient triumphs of the Church; because it is a more honorable distinction for a conqueror to dispense his bounty largely to all classes, than to gather spoils from the vanquished.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p25"></A>The interpretation given by some, that Christ received from the Father what he would distribute to us, is forced, and utterly at variance with the apostle&#8217;s purpose. No solution of the difficulty, in my opinion, is more natural than this. Having made a brief quotation from the Psalm, Paul took the liberty of adding a statement, which, though not contained in the Psalm, is true in reference to Christ &#8212; a statement, too, by which the 		ascension of Christ is proved to be more illustrious, and more worthy of admiration, than those ancient manifestations of the Divine glory which David enumerates.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v.ii-p26"></A><a name="iv.v.ii-p26.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p27"></A><b>9.</b><i> Now that he ascended.</i> Here again the slanderers exclaim, that Paul&#8217;s reasoning is trifling and childish. &#8220;Why does he attempt to make those words apply to a real ascension of Christ, which were figuratively spoken about a manifestation of the Divine glory? Who does not know that the word <i>ascend</i> is metaphorical? The conclusion, <i>that he also descended first,</i> has therefore no weight.&#8221;</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p28"></A>I answer, Paul does not here reason in the manner of a logician, as to what necessarily follows, or may be inferred, from the words of the prophet. He knew that what David spake about God&#8217;s ascension was metaphorical. But neither can it be denied, that the expression bears a reference to some kind of humiliation on the part of God which had previously existed. It is this humiliation which Paul justly infers from the 		declaration that God had ascended. And at what time did God descend lower than when Christ <i>emptied himself?</i> ( &#8127;&#913;&#955;&#955; &#8127; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7952;&#954;&#8051;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#949;, <a name="iv.v.ii-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007">Php 2:7</a><a name="iv.v.ii-p28.1"></A>.) If ever there was a time when, after appearing to lay aside the brightness of his 		power, God ascended gloriously, it was when Christ was raised from our lowest condition on earth, and received into heavenly glory.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p29"></A>Besides, it is not necessary to inquire very carefully into the literal exposition of the Psalm, since Paul merely alludes to the prophet&#8217;s words, in the same manner as, on another occasion, he accommodates to his own subject a passage taken from the writings of Moses. &#8220;The righteousness which is of faith speaketh in this manner, Say not in thine heart, who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above;) or, who shall 		descend into the deep (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.&#8221;) (<a name="iv.v.ii-p29.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006">Rom. 10:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#007">7</a><a name="iv.v.ii-p29.1"></A> <a name="iv.v.ii-p29.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#012">De 30:12</a><a name="iv.v.ii-p29.2"></A>.) But the appropriateness of the application which Paul makes of the passage to the person of Christ is not the only ground on which it must be defended. Sufficient evidence is afforded by the Psalm 		itself, that this ascription of praise relates to Christ&#8217;s kingdom. Not to mention other reasons which might be urged, it contains a distinct prophecy of the calling of the Gentiles.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p30"></A><i>Into the lower parts of the earth. </i>  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">140</FONT></A>
 		 These words mean nothing more than the condition of the present life. To torture them so as to make them mean purgatory or hell, is exceedingly foolish. The argument taken from the comparative degree, &#8220;the <i>lower</i> parts,&#8221; is quite untenable. A comparison is drawn, not between one part of the earth and another, but 		between the whole earth and heaven; as if he had said, that from that lofty habitation Christ descended into our deep gulf.</p>

<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p33"></A><b>10.</b> <i>That ascended up far above all heavens;</i> that is, beyond this created world.

Heaven denotes a place higher than all the spheres, which was assigned to the Son of God after his resurrection.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">141</FONT></A>
 		 Not that it is literally a place beyond the world, but we cannot speak of the kingdom of God without using our ordinary language. Others, again, considering that the expressions, <i>above all heavens,</i> and <i>ascension into heaven,</i> are of the same import, conclude that Christ is not separated from us by distance of place. But one point they have overlooked. When Christ is 		placed above the heavens, or in the heavens, all that surrounds the earth &#8212; all that lies beneath the sun and stars, beneath the whole frame of the visible world &#8212; is excluded.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p35"></A><i>That he might fill all things.</i> <i>To fill</i> often signifies to Finish, and it might have that meaning here; for, by his ascension into heaven, Christ entered into the possession of the authority given to him by the Father, that he might rule and govern all things. But a more beautiful view, in my opinion, will be obtained by connecting two meanings 		which, though apparently contradictory, are perfectly consistent. When we hear of the ascension of Christ, it instantly strikes our minds that he is removed to a great distance from us; and so he actually is, with respect to his body and human presence. But Paul reminds us, that, while he is removed from us in bodily presence, he <i>fills all things</i> by the power of his Spirit. Wherever the right hand of God, which embraces heaven and earth, is 		displayed, Christ is spiritually present by his boundless power; although, as respects his body, the saying of Peter holds true, that</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p36"></A>&#8220;the heaven must receive him until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.&#8221; (<a name="iv.v.ii-p36.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021">Ac 3:21</a><a name="iv.v.ii-p36.1"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ii-p37"></A>By alluding to the seeming contradiction, the apostle has added not a little beauty to his language. <i>He ascended;</i> but it was that he, who was formerly bounded by a little space, <i>might fill all things</i>  But did he not fill them before?

<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p12"></A>He returns to explain the distribution of gifts, and illustrates at greater length what he had slightly hinted, that out of this variety arises unity in the church, as the various tones in music produce sweet melody. The meaning may be thus summed up. &#8220;The external ministry of the word is also commended, on account of the advantages which it yields. Certain men appointed to that office, are employed in preaching the gospel. This is the 		arrangement by which the Lord is pleased to govern his church, to maintain its existence, and ultimately to secure its highest perfection.&#8221;</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p13"></A>It may excite surprise, that, when the gifts of the Holy Spirit form the subject of discussion, Paul should enumerate offices instead of gifts. I reply, when men are called by God, gifts are necessarily connected with offices. God does not confer on men the mere name of Apostles or Pastors, but also endows them with gifts, without which they cannot properly discharge their office. He whom God has appointed to be an apostle does not bear 		an empty and useless title; for the divine command, and the ability to perform it, go together. Let us now examine the words in detail.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p14"></A><b>11.</b><i> And he gave.</i> The government of the church, by the preaching of the word, is first of all declared to be no human contrivance, but a most sacred ordinance of Christ. The apostles did not appoint themselves, but were chosen by Christ; and, at the present day, true pastors do not rashly thrust themselves forward by their own judgment, but are raised up by the Lord. In 		short, the government of the church, by the ministry of the word, is not a contrivance of men, but an appointment made by the Son of God. As his own unalterable law, it demands our assent. They who reject or despise this ministry offer insult and rebellion to Christ its Author. It is himself who <i>gave</i> them; for, if he does not raise them up, there will be none. Another inference is, that no man will be fit or qualified 		for so distinguished an office who has not been formed and moulded by the hand of Christ himself. To Christ we owe it that we have ministers of the gospel, that they abound in necessary qualifications, that they execute the trust committed to them. All, all is his <i>gift.</i></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p15"></A><i>Some, apostles.</i> The different names and offices assigned to different persons take their rise from that diversity of the members which goes to form the completeness of the whole body, &#8212; every ground of emulation, and envy, and ambition, being thus removed. If every person shall display a selfish character, shall strive to outshine his neighbor, and shall disregard all concerns but his own, &#8212; or, 		if more eminent persons shall be the object of envy to those who occupy a lower place, &#8212; in each, and in all of these cases, gifts are not applied to their proper use. He therefore reminds them, that the gifts bestowed on individuals are intended, not to be held for their personal and separate interests, but to be employed for the benefit of the whole. Of the offices which are here enumerated, we have already spoken at considerable length,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">143</FONT></A>
 		 and shall now say nothing more than the exposition of the passage seems to demand. Five classes of office-bearers are mentioned, though on this point, I am aware, there is a diversity of opinion; for some consider the two last to make but one office. Leaving out of view the opinions of others, I shall proceed to state my own.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p17"></A>I take the word <i>apostles</i> not in that general sense which the derivation of the term might warrant, but in its own peculiar signification, for those highly favored persons whom Christ exalted to the highest honor. Such were the twelve, to whose number Paul was afterwards added. Their office was to spread the doctrine of the gospel throughout the whole world, to plant 		churches, and to erect the kingdom of Christ. They had not churches of their own committed to them; but the injunction given to all of them was, to preach the gospel wherever they went.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p18"></A>Next to them come the <i>Evangelists,</i> who were closely allied in the nature of their office, but held an inferior rank. To this class belonged Timothy and others; for, while Paul mentions them along with himself in the salutations of his epistles, he does not speak of them as his companions in the apostleship, but claims this name as peculiarly his own. The services in which 		the Lord employed them were auxiliary to those of the apostles, to whom they were next in rank.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p19"></A>To these two classes the apostle adds <i>Prophets.</i> By this name some understand those persons who possessed the gift of predicting future events, among whom was Agabus. (<a name="iv.v.iii-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028">Acts 11:28</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#010">Acts 21:10</a><a name="iv.v.iii-p19.1"></A>.) But, for my own part, as 		doctrine is the present subject, I would rather define the word <i>prophets,</i> as on a former occasion,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">144</FONT></A>
 		 to mean distinguished interpreters of prophecies, who, by a remarkable gift of revelation, applied them to the subjects which they had occasion to handle; not excluding, however, the gift of prophecy, by which their doctrinal instruction was usually accompanied.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p21"></A><i>Pastors and Teachers</i> are supposed by some to denote one office, because the apostle does not, as in the other parts of the verse, say, <i>and some, pastors; and some, teachers;</i> but, &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#948;&#8050;, &#960;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#945;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#963;&#954;&#8049;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#962;, <i>and some, pastors and teachers</i>  Chrysostom and Augustine are of this opinion; not to mention the commentaries of Ambrose, whose observations on the subject are truly childish and unworthy of himself. I partly agree with them, that Paul speaks indiscriminately of pastors and teachers as belonging to one and the same class, and that the name <i>teacher</i> does, to some extent, apply to all <i>pastors.</i> But this does not appear to me a sufficient reason why two offices, which I find to differ from each other, should be confounded. Teaching is, no doubt, the duty of all pastors; but to maintain sound doctrine requires a talent for interpreting Scripture, and a man may be a <i>teacher</i> who is not qualified to preach.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p22"></A><i>Pastors,</i> in my opinion, are those who have the charge of a particular flock; though I have no objection to their receiving the name of <i>teachers,</i> if it be understood that there is a distinct class of <i>teachers,</i> who preside both in the education of pastors and in the instruction of the whole church. 		It may sometimes happen, that the same person is both a pastor and a teacher, but the duties to be performed are entirely different.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p23"></A>It deserves attention, also, that, of the five offices which are here enumerated, not more than the last two are intended to be perpetual. Apostles, Evangelists, and Prophets were bestowed on the church for a limited time only, &#8212; except in those cases where religion has fallen into decay, and evangelists are raised up in an extraordinary manner, to restore the pure doctrine which had been lost. But without Pastors and Teachers there can 		be no government of the church.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p24"></A>Papists have some reason to complain, that their primacy, of which they boast so much, is openly insulted in this passage. The subject of discussion is the unity of the church. Paul inquires into the means by which its continuance is secured, and the outward expressions by which it is promoted, and comes at length to the government of the church. If he knew a primacy which had a fixed residence, was it not his duty, for the benefit of the 		whole church, to exhibit one ministerial head placed over all the members, under whose government we are collected into one body? We must either charge Paul with inexcusable neglect and foolishness, in leaving out the most appropriate and powerful argument, or we must acknowledge that this primacy is at variance with the appointment of Christ. In truth, he plainly rejects it as without foundation, when he ascribes superiority to Christ alone, and represents the apostles, and all the pastors, as 		indeed inferior to Him, but associated on an equal level with each other. There is no passage of Scripture by which that tyrannical hierarchy, regulated by one earthly head, is more completely overturned. Paul has been followed by Cyprian, who gives a short and clear definition of what forms the only lawful monarchy in the church. There is, he says, one <i>bishoprick,</i> which unites the various parts into one whole. This <i>bishoprick</i> he claims for Christ alone, leaving the administration 		of it to individuals, but in a united capacity, no one being permitted to exalt himself above others.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v.iii-p25"></A><a name="iv.v.iii-p25.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p26"></A><b>12.</b> <i>For the renewing of the saints.</i> In this version I follow Erasmus, not because I prefer his view, but to allow the reader an opportunity of comparing his version with the Vulgate and with mine, and then choosing for himself. The old translation was, (<a name="iv.v.iii-p26.1"></A><i>ad</i> <i>consummationem</i><i>,</i>) <i>for the completeness.</i> The Greek word employed by Paul is &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#8057;&#962;, which signifies literally the <i>adaptation</i> of things possessing symmetry and proportion; just as, in the human body, the members are united in a proper and regular 		manner; so that the word comes to signify <i>perfection.</i> But as Paul intended to express here a just and orderly arrangement, I prefer the word (<a name="iv.v.iii-p26.2"></A><i>constitutio</i>) <i>settlement</i> or <i>constitution,</i> taking it in that sense in which a commonwealth, or 		kingdom, or province, is said to be <i>settled,</i> when confusion gives place to the regular administration of law.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p27"></A><i>For the work of the ministry.</i> God might himself have performed this work, if he had chosen; but he has committed it to the<i> ministry</i> of men. This is intended to anticipate an objection. &#8220;Cannot the church be constituted and properly arranged, without the instrumentality of men?&#8221; Paul asserts that a <i>ministry</i> is required, because such is the will of God.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p28"></A><i>For the edifying of the body of Christ.</i> This is the same thing with what he had formerly denominated the <i>settlement</i> or<i> perfecting of the saints.</i> Our true completeness and perfection consist in our being united in the one body of Christ. No language more highly commendatory of the ministry of the 		word could have been employed, than to ascribe to it this effect. What is more excellent than to produce the true and complete perfection of the church? And yet this work, so admirable and divine, is here declared by the apostle to be accomplished by the external ministry of the word. That those who neglect this instrument should hope to become perfect in Christ is utter madness. Yet such are the fanatics, on the one hand, who pretend to be favored with secret revelations of the Spirit, &#8212; and 		proud men, on the other, who imagine that to them the private reading of the Scriptures is enough, and that they have no need of the ordinary ministry of the church.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p29"></A>If the edification of the church proceeds from Christ alone, he has surely a right to prescribe in what manner it shall be edified. But Paul expressly states, that, according to the command of Christ, no real union or perfection is attained, but by the outward preaching. We must allow ourselves to be ruled and taught by men. This is the universal rule, which extends equally to the highest and to the lowest. The church is the common mother 		of all the godly, which bears, nourishes, and brings up children to God, kings and peasants alike; and this is done by the ministry. Those who neglect or despise this order choose to be wiser than Christ. Woe to the pride of such men! It is, no doubt, a thing in itself possible that divine influence alone should make us perfect without human assistance. But the present inquiry is not what the power of God can accomplish, but what is the will of God and the appointment of Christ. In employing 		human instruments for accomplishing their salvation, God has conferred on men no ordinary favor. Nor can any exercise be found better adapted to promote unity than to gather around the common doctrine &#8212; the standard of our General.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v.iii-p30"></A><a name="iv.v.iii-p30.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p31"></A><b>13.</b> <i>Till we all come.</i> Paul had already said, that by the ministry of men the church is regulated and governed, so as to attain the highest perfection. But his commendation of the ministry is now carried farther. The necessity for which he had pleaded is not confined to a single day, but continues to the end. Or, to speak more plainly, he reminds 		his readers that the use of the ministry is not temporal, like that of a school for children, (&#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#8055;&#945;, <a name="iv.v.iii-p31.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024">Ga 3:24</a><a name="iv.v.iii-p31.1"></A>,) but constant, so long as we remain in the world. Enthusiasts dream that the use of the ministry ceases as soon as we have been led to Christ. Proud men, who carry their desire of knowledge beyond what is proper, 		look down with contempt on the elementary instruction of childhood. But Paul maintains that we must persevere in this course till all our deficiencies are supplied; that we must make progress till death, under the teaching of Christ alone; and that we must not be ashamed to be the scholars of the church, to which Christ has committed our education.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p32"></A><i>In the unity of the faith.</i> But ought not the unity of the faith to reign among us from the very commencement? It does reign, I acknowledge, among the sons of God, but not so perfectly as to make them <i>come</i> <i>together.</i> Such is the weakness of our nature, that it is enough if every day brings some 		nearer to others, and all nearer to Christ. The expression, <i>coming together,</i> denotes that closest union to which we still aspire, and which we shall never reach, until this garment of the flesh, which is always accompanied by some remains of ignorance and weakness, shall have been laid aside.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p33"></A><i>And of the knowledge of the Son of God.</i> This clause appears to be added for the sake of explanation. It was the apostle&#8217;s intention to explain what is the nature of true faith, and in what it consists; that is, when the Son of God is known. To the Son of God alone faith ought to look; on him it relies; in him it rests and terminates. If it proceed farther, it will disappear, and will no longer be 		faith, but a delusion. Let us remember, that true faith confines its view so entirely to Christ, that it neither knows, nor desires to know, anything else.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p34"></A><i>Into a perfect man.</i> This must be read in immediate connection with what goes before; as if he had said, &#8220;What is the highest perfection of Christians? How is that perfection attained?&#8221; Full manhood is found in Christ; for foolish men do not, in a proper manner, seek their perfection in Christ. It 		ought to be held as a fixed principle among us, that all that is out of Christ is hurtful and destructive. Whoever is a man in Christ, is, in every respect, a perfect man.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p35"></A><i>The AGE of fullness</i> means &#8212; full or mature age. No mention is made of old age, for in the Christian progress no place for it is found. Whatever becomes old has a tendency to decay; but the vigor of this spiritual life is continually advancing.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v.iii-p36"></A><a name="iv.v.iii-p36.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p37"></A><b>14.</b> <i>That we may be no more children.</i> Having spoken of that perfect manhood, towards which we are proceeding throughout the whole course of our life, he reminds us that, during such a progress, we ought not to resemble children. An intervening period is thus pointed out between childhood and man&#8217;s estate. Those are &#8220;children&#8221; who have not yet advanced a step in the way of the Lord, but who still hesitate, &#8212; who have not yet determined what road they ought to choose, but move sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another, always doubtful, always wavering. Those, again, who are thoroughly founded in the doctrine of Christ, though not yet perfect, have so much wisdom and vigor as to choose properly, and proceed 		steadily, in the right course. Thus we find that the life of believers, marked by a constant desire and progress towards those attainments which they shall ultimately reach, bears a resemblance to youth. At no period of this life are we men. But let not such a statement be carried to the other extreme, as if there were no progress beyond childhood. After being born to Christ, we ought to grow, so as &#8220;not to be children in understanding.&#8221; (<a name="iv.v.iii-p37.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020">1Co 14:20</a><a name="iv.v.iii-p37.2"></A>.) Hence it appears what kind of Christianity the Popish system must be, when the pastors labor, to the utmost of their power, to keep the people in absolute infancy.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p38"></A><i>Tossed to and fro, and carried about.</i> The distressing hesitation of those who do not place absolute reliance on the word of the Lord, is illustrated by two striking metaphors. The first is taken from small ships, exposed to the fury of the billows in the open sea, holding no fixed course, guided neither by skill nor design, but hurried along by the violence of the tempest. The next is taken from 		straws, or other light substances, which are carried hither and thither as the wind drives them, and often in opposite directions. Such must be the changeable and unsteady character of all who do not rest on the foundation of God&#8217;s eternal truth. It is their just punishment for looking, not to God, but to men. Paul declares, on the other hand, that faith, which rests on the word of God, stands unshaken against all the attacks of Satan.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p39"></A><i>By every wind of doctrine.</i> By a beautiful metaphor, all the doctrines of men, by which we are drawn away from the simplicity of the gospel, are called <i>winds</i>  God gave us his word, by which we might have placed ourselves beyond the possibility of being moved; but, giving way to the contrivances of men, we are carried about 		in all directions.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p40"></A><i>By the cunning of men.</i> There will always be impostors, who make insidious attacks upon our faith; but, if we are fortified by the truth of God, their efforts will be unavailing. Both parts of this statement deserve our careful attention. When new sects, or wicked tenets, spring up, many persons become alarmed. But the attempts of Satan to darken, by his falsehoods, the pure doctrine of Christ, 		are at no time interrupted; and it is the will of God that these struggles should be the trial of our faith. When we are informed, on the other hand, that the best and readiest defense against every kind of error is to bring forward that doctrine which we have learned from Christ and his apostles, this surely is no ordinary consolation.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p41"></A>With what awful wickedness, then, are Papists chargeable, who take away from the word of God everything like certainty, and maintain that there is no steadiness of faith, but what depends on the authority of men! If a man entertain any doubt, it is in vain to bid him consult the word of God: he must abide by their decrees. But we have embraced the law, the prophets, and the gospel. Let us therefore confidently expect that we shall reap 		the advantage which is here promised, &#8212; that all the impostures of men will do us no harm. They will attack us, indeed, but they will not prevail. We are entitled, I acknowledge, to look for the dispensation of sound doctrine from the church, for God has committed it to her charge; but when Papists avail themselves of the disguise of the church for burying doctrine, they give sufficient proof that they have a diabolical synagogue.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iii-p42"></A>The Greek word &#954;&#965;&#946;&#949;&#8055;&#945;, which I have translated <i>cunning,</i> is taken from players at dice, who are accustomed to practice many arts of deception. The words, &#7952;&#957; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#947;&#8055;&#945;&#837;, <i>by craftiness,</i> intimate that 		the ministers of Satan are deeply skilled in imposture; and it is added, that they keep watch, in order to insnare, (&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#956;&#949;&#952;&#959;&#948;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&#957; &#964;&#8034;&#962; &#960;&#955;&#8049;&#957;&#951;&#962;.) All this should rouse and sharpen our minds to profit by the word of God. If we neglect to do so, we may fall into the snares of our enemies, and endure the severe punishment of our sloth.</p>  <a name="iv.v.iv"></A>

 		 Though we have not arrived at man&#8217;s estate, we ought at least, as we have already said, to be advanced children. The truth of God ought to have such a firm hold of us, that all the contrivances and attacks of Satan shall not draw us from our course; and yet, as we have not hitherto attained full and complete strength, we must make progress until death.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iv-p10"></A>He points out the design of this progress, that Christ may be <i>the head</i>, &#8220;that in all things he may have the pre-eminence,&#8221; (<a name="iv.v.iv-p10.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018">Col 1:18</a><a name="iv.v.iv-p10.1"></A>,) and that in him alone we may grow in vigor or in stature. Again, we see that no man is excepted; all are enjoined to be subject, and to take their own places in the body.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iv-p11"></A>What aspect then does Popery present, but that of a crooked, deformed person? Is not the whole symmetry of the church destroyed, when one man, acting in opposition to the head, refuses to be reckoned one of the members? The Papists deny this, and allege that the Pope is nothing more than a ministerial head. But such cavils do them no service. The tyranny of their idol must be acknowledged to be altogether inconsistent with that order which 		Paul here recommends. In a word, a healthful condition of the church requires that Christ alone &#8220;must increase,&#8221; and all others &#8220;must decrease.&#8221; (<a name="iv.v.iv-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#030">Joh 3:30</a><a name="iv.v.iv-p11.1"></A>.)

<p><a name="iv.v.iv-p12"></A>When he bids us give heed to the truth <i>in love,</i> he uses the preposition <i>in</i>, (&#7952;&#957;,) like the corresponding Hebrew preposition <a name="iv.v.iv-p12.1"></A>&#1489;, (<i>beth</i>,) as signifying <i>with</i>, &#8212; <i>speaking the truth With love</i>   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">146</FONT></A>
 		 If each individual, instead of attending exclusively to his own concerns, shall desire mutual intercourse, there will be agreeable and general progress. Such, the Apostle assures us, must be the nature of this harmony, that men shall not be suffered to forget the claims of truth, or, disregarding them, to frame an agreement according to their own views. This proves the wickedness of the Papists, who lay aside the word of God, and labor to force our compliance with 		their decisions.</p>

<p><a name="iv.v.iv-p15"></A><b>16.</b> <i>From whom the whole body.</i> All our increase should tend to exalt more highly the glory of Christ. This is now proved by the best possible reason. It is he who supplies all our wants, and without whose protection we cannot be safe. As the root conveys sap to the whole tree, so all the vigor which we possess must flow to us from Christ. There are 		three things here which deserve our attention. The first is what has now been stated. All the life or health which is diffused through the members flows from the head; so that the members occupy a subordinate rank. The second is, that, by the distribution made, the limited share of each renders the communication between all the members absolutely necessary. The third is, that, without mutual love, the health of the body cannot be maintained. Through the members, as canals, is conveyed from the 		head all that is necessary for the nourishment of the body. While this connection is upheld, the body is alive and healthy. Each member, too, has its own proper share, &#8212; <i>according to the effectual working in the measure of every part.</i></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.iv-p16"></A>Lastly, he shows that by love the church is edified, &#8212; <i>to the edifying of itself in love.</i> This means that no increase is advantageous, which does not bear a just proportion to the whole body. That man is mistaken who desires his own separate growth. If a leg or arm should grow to a prodigious size, or the mouth be more fully distended, would the undue enlargement of those 		parts be otherwise than injurious to the whole frame? In like manner, if we wish to be considered members of Christ, let no man be anything for himself, but let us all be whatever we are for the benefit of each other. This is accomplished by love; and where it does not reign, there is no &#8220;edification,&#8221; but an absolute scattering of the church.</p>  <a name="iv.v.v"></A>

<p><a name="iv.v.v-p11"></A><i>That ye henceforth walk not in vanity.</i> He first exhorts them to renounce the <i>vanity</i> of unbelievers, arguing from its inconsistency with their present views. That those who have been taught in the school of Christ, and enlightened by the doctrine of salvation, should follow vanity, and in no respect differ from those unbelieving and blind nations on 		whom no light of truth has ever shone, would be singularly foolish. On this ground he very properly calls upon them to demonstrate, by their life, that they had gained some advantage by becoming the disciples of Christ. To impart to his exhortation the greater earnestness, he beseeches them by the name of God, &#8212; <i>this I say and testify in the Lord,</i>   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">147</FONT></A>
 		 &#8212; reminding them, that, if they despised this instruction, they must one day give an account.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.v-p13"></A><i>As other Gentiles walk.</i> He means those who had not yet been converted to Christ. But, at the same time, he reminds the Ephesians how necessary it was that they should repent, since by nature they resembled lost and condemned men. The miserable and shocking condition of other nations is held out as the motive to a change of disposition. He asserts that believers differ from unbelievers; and points 		out, as we shall see, the causes of this difference. With regard to the former, he accuses their mind of <i>vanity:</i> and let us remember, that he speaks generally of all who have not been renewed by the Spirit of Christ.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.v-p14"></A><i>In the vanity of their mind.</i> Now, <i>the mind</i> holds the highest rank in the human constitution, is the seat of reason, presides over the will, and restrains sinful desires; so that our theologians of the <i>Sorbonne</i> are in the habit of calling her the Queen. But, Paul makes the <i>mind</i> to consist of nothing else than vanity; and, as if he had not expressed his meaning strongly enough, he gives no better title to her daughter, <i>the understanding.</i> Such is my interpretation of the word &#948;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#8055;&#945;; for, though it signifies the thought, yet, as it is in the singular number, it refers to the thinking faculty. Plato, about the close of his Sixth 		Book on a Republic, assigns to &#948;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#8055;&#945; an intermediate place between &#957;&#8057;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; and &#960;&#8055;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962; but his observations are so entirely confined to geometrical subjects, as not to admit of application to this passage. Having formerly asserted that men see nothing, Paul now adds, that they are blind in reasoning, even on the most important subjects.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.v-p15"></A>Let men now go and be proud of free-will, whose guidance is here marked by so deep disgrace. But experience, we shall be told, is openly at variance with this opinion; for men are not so blind as to be incapable of seeing anything, nor so vain as to be incapable of forming any judgment. I answer, with respect to the kingdom of God, and all that relates to the spiritual life, the light of human reason differs little from darkness; for, 		before it has pointed out the road, it is extinguished; and its power of perception is little else than blindness, for ere it has reached the fruit, it is gone. The true principles held by the human mind resemble sparks;  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_147"></A><A HREF="#fn_147"><FONT SIZE="1">148</FONT></A>
 		but these are choked by the depravity of our nature, before they have been applied to their proper use. All men know, for instance, that there is a God, and that it is our duty to worship him; but such is the power of sin and ignorance, that from this confused knowledge we pass all at once to an idol, and worship it in the place of God. And even in the worship of God, it leads to great errors, particularly in the first table of the law.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.v-p17"></A>As to the second objection, our judgment does indeed agree with the law of God in regard to the mere outward actions; but sinful desire, which is the source of everything evil, escapes our notice. Besides, Paul does not speak merely of the natural blindness which we brought with us from the womb, but refers also to a still grosser blindness, by which, as we shall afterwards see, God punishes former transgressions. We conclude with 		observing, that the reason and understanding which men naturally possess, make them in the sight of God without excuse; but, so long as they allow themselves to live according to their natural disposition, they can only wander, and fall, and stumble in their purposes and actions. Hence it appears in what estimation and value false worship must appear in the sight of God, when it proceeds from the gulf of vanity and the maze of ignorance.</p>

<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.v.v-p20"></A>&#8220;they loved the praise of men more than <i>the praise of God</i>,&#8221;<br> 		(<a name="iv.v.v-p20.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#043">Joh 12:43</a><a name="iv.v.v-p20.2"></A>,)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.v-p21"></A>or, that life which God bestows on his elect by the Spirit of regeneration. In both cases the meaning is the same. Our ordinary life, as men, is nothing more than an empty image of life, not only because it quickly passes, but also because, while we live, our souls, not keeping close to God, are dead. There are three kinds of life in this world. The first is animal life, which consists only of motion and the bodily senses, 		and which we have in common with the brutes; the second is human life, which we have as the children of Adam; and the third is that supernatural life, which believers alone obtain. And all of them are from God, so that each of them may be called <i>the life of God.</i> As to the first, Paul, in his sermon at Athens, says, (<a name="iv.v.v-p21.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028">Ac 17:28</a><a name="iv.v.v-p21.1"></A>,) &#8220;In him we live, and move, and have our being;&#8221; and the Psalmist says,</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.v.v-p22"></A>&#8220;Send forth thy Spirit, and they shall be created; and thou wilt renew the face of the earth.&#8221; (<a name="iv.v.v-p22.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#030">Ps 104:30</a><a name="iv.v.v-p22.1"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.v-p23"></A>Of the second Job says,</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.v.v-p24"></A>&#8220;Thou hast granted me life, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.&#8221; (<a name="iv.v.v-p24.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#012">Job 10:12</a><a name="iv.v.v-p24.1"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.v-p25"></A>But the regeneration of believers is here called, by way of eminence, <i>the life of God, </i>because then does God truly live in us, and we enjoy his life, when he governs us by his Spirit. Of this life all men who are not new creatures in Christ are declared by Paul to be destitute. So long, then, as we remain in the flesh, that is, in ourselves, how wretched must be our 		condition! We may now form a judgment of all the moral virtues, as they are called; for what sort of actions will that life produce which, Paul affirms, is not the life of God? Before anything good can begin to proceed from us, we must first be renewed by the grace of Christ. This will be the commencement of a true, and, as the phrase is, a <i>vital</i> life.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.v-p26"></A><i>On account of the ignorance that is in them.</i> We ought to attend to the reason which is here assigned; for, as the knowledge of God is the true life of the soul, so, on the contrary, ignorance is the death of it. And lest we should adopt the opinion of philosophers, that ignorance, which leads us into mistakes, is only an incidental evil, Paul shews that it has its root <i>in 		the blindness of their heart,</i> by which he intimates that it dwells in their very nature. The first blindness, therefore, which covers the minds of men, is the punishment of original sin; because Adam, after his revolt, was deprived of the true light of God, in the absence of which there is nothing but fearful darkness.</p>

<p><a name="iv.v.v-p28"></A><b>19.</b> <i>Who being past feeling.</i> The account which had been given of natural depravity is followed by a description of the worst of all evils, brought upon men by their own sinful conduct. Having destroyed the sensibilities of the heart, and allayed the stings of remorse, they abandon themselves to all manner of iniquity. We are by nature corrupt and 		prone to evil; nay, we are wholly inclined to evil. Those who are destitute of the Spirit of Christ give loose reins to self-indulgence, till fresh offenses, producing others in constant succession, bring down upon them the wrath of God. The voice of God, proclaimed by an accusing conscience, still continues to be heard; but, instead of producing its proper effects, appears rather to harden them against all admonition. On account of such obstinacy, they deserve to be altogether forsaken by 		God.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.v-p29"></A>The usual symptom of their having been thus forsaken is &#8212; the insensibility to pain, which is here described &#8212; <i>being past feeling</i>. Unmoved by the approaching judgment of God, whom they offend, they go on at their ease, and fearlessly indulge without restraint in the pleasures of sin. No shame is felt, no regard to character is maintained. The gnawing of a guilty conscience, 		tormented by the dread of the Divine judgment, may be compared to the porch of hell; but such hardened security as this &#8212; is a whirlpool which swallows up and destroys. As Solomon says,</p>

<p><a name="iv.v.v-p31"></A>Most properly, therefore, does Paul exhibit that dreadful example of Divine vengeance, in which men forsaken by God &#8212; having laid conscience to sleep, and destroyed all fear of the Divine judgment, &#8212; in a word, <i>being past feeling, </i>&#8212; surrender themselves with brutal violence to all wickedness. This is not universally the case. Many even of the reprobate are restrained by 		God, whose infinite goodness prevents the absolute confusion in which the world would otherwise be involved. The consequence is, that such open lust, such unrestrained intemperance, does not appear in all. It is enough that the lives of some present such a mirror, fitted to awaken our alarm lest anything similar should happen to ourselves.</p>

It is added, <i>with 		greediness</i>. The Greek word &#960;&#955;&#949;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#958;&#8055;&#945;, which is so translated, often signifies covetousness, (<a name="iv.v.v-p32.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#015">Lu 12:15</a><a name="iv.v.v-p32.1"></A>; <a name="iv.v.v-p32.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014">2Pe 2:14</a><a name="iv.v.v-p32.2"></A>,) and is so explained by some in this passage; but I cannot adopt that view.

Because the Gentiles walk in darkness, therefore they do not distinguish between right and wrong; but those on whom the 		truth of God shines ought to live in a different manner. That those to whom the vanity of the senses is a rule of life, should yield themselves up to base lusts, is not surprising; but the doctrine of Christ teaches us to renounce our natural dispositions. He whose life differs not from that of unbelievers, has learned nothing of Christ; for the knowledge of Christ cannot be separated from the mortification of the flesh.</p>

<p><a name="iv.v.vi-p16"></A><b>21.</b> <i>If ye have heard him.</i> To excite their attention and earnestness the more, he not only tells them that they had <i>heard Christ,</i> but employs a still stronger expression, <i>ye have been taught in him,</i> as if he had said, that this doctrine had not been 		slightly pointed out, but faithfully delivered and explained.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.vi-p17"></A><i>As the truth is in Jesus.</i> This contains a reproof of that superficial knowledge of the gospel, by which many are elated, who are wholly unacquainted with newness of life. They think that they are exceedingly wise, but the apostle pronounces it to be a false and mistaken opinion. There is a twofold knowledge of Christ, &#8212; one, which is true and genuine, &#8212; and another, which is counterfeit and 		spurious. Not that, strictly speaking, there are two kinds; but most men falsely imagine that they know Christ, while they know nothing but what is carnal. In another Epistle he says,</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.v.vi-p18"></A>&#8220;If any man be in Christ, let him be a new creature.&#8221;<br> 		(<a name="iv.v.vi-p18.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017">2Co 5:17</a><a name="iv.v.vi-p18.2"></A>.)</p>

<p><a name="iv.v.vi-p21"></A><b>22.</b> <i>That ye put off.</i> He demands from a Christian man repentance, or a new life, which he makes to consist of self-denial and the regeneration of the Holy Spirit. Beginning with the first, he enjoins us to lay aside, or <i>put off</i> the old man, employing the metaphor of garments, which we have already 		had occasion to explain. <i>The old man,</i> &#8212; as we have repeatedly stated, in expounding the sixth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, and other passages where it occurs, &#8212; means the natural disposition which we bring with us from our mother&#8217;s womb. In two persons, Adam and Christ, he describes to us what may be called two natures. As we are first 		born of Adam, the depravity of nature which we derive from him is called the <i>Old</i> man; and as we are born again in Christ, the amendment of this sinful nature is called the <i>New</i> man. In a word, he who desires to put off the old man must renounce his nature. To suppose that the words <i>Old</i> and<i> 		New</i> contain an allusion to the Old and New Testaments, is exceedingly unphilosophical.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.vi-p22"></A><i>Concerning the former conversation.</i> To make it more evident that this exhortation to the Ephesians was not unnecessary, he reminds them of their former life. &#8220;Before Christ revealed himself to your minds, the old man reigned in you; and therefore, if you desire to lay him aside, you must renounce your former life.&#8221; <i>Which is corrupted.</i> He describes the old man from the fruits, that is, from the wicked desires, which allure men to destruction; for the word, <i>corrupt,</i> alludes to old age, which is closely allied to corruption. Let us beware of considering <i>the deceitful lusts,</i> as the Papists do, to mean nothing more than the 		gross and visible lusts, which are generally acknowledged to be base. The word includes also those dispositions which, instead of being censured, are sometimes applauded, &#8212; such as ambition, cunning, and everything that proceeds either from self-love or from want of confidence in God.</p>

<p><a name="iv.v.vi-p24"></A><b>23.</b><i> And be renewed.</i> The second part of the rule for a devout and holy life is to live, not in our own spirit, but in the Spirit of Christ. But what is meant by &#8212; <i>the spirit of your mind?</i> I understand it simply to mean, &#8212; <i>Be renewed,</i> not only with 		respect to the inferior appetites or desires, which are manifestly sinful, but with respect also to that part of the soul which is reckoned most noble and excellent. And here again, he brings forward to view that Queen which philosophers are accustomed almost to adore. There is an implied contrast between <i>the spirit of our mind</i> and the Divine and heavenly Spirit, who produces in us another and a new mind. How much there is in us that is sound or 		uncorrupted may be easily gathered from this passage, which enjoins us to correct chiefly the reason or <i>mind,</i> in which we are apt to imagine that there is nothing but what is virtuous and deserves commendation.</p>

<p><a name="iv.v.vi-p26"></A><b>24.</b> <i>And that ye put on the new man.</i> All that is meant is, &#8220;Be renewed in the spirit, or, be renewed <i>within</i> or <i>completely,</i> &#8212; beginning with the mind, which appears to be the part most free from all 		taint of sin.&#8221; What is added about the creation, may refer either to the first creation of man, or to the second creation, which is effected by the grace of Christ. Both expositions will be true. Adam was at first created after the image of God, and reflected, as in a mirror, the Divine righteousness; but that image, having been defaced by sin, must now be restored in Christ. The regeneration of the godly is indeed &#8212; as we have formerly 		explained   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_148"><FONT SIZE="1">149</FONT></A>
 		 &#8212; nothing else than the formation anew of the image of God in them. There is, no doubt, a far more rich and powerful manifestation of Divine grace in this second creation than in the first; but our highest perfection is uniformly represented in Scripture as consisting in our conformity and resemblance to God. Adam lost the image which he had originally received, and therefore it becomes necessary that it shall be restored to us by Christ. The design contemplated 		by regeneration is to recall us from our wanderings to that end for which we were created.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.vi-p28"></A><i>In righteousness.</i> If <i>righteousness</i> be taken as a general term for uprightness, <i>holiness</i> will be something higher, or that purity which lies in being devoted to the service of God.

The genitive, <i>of 		truth</i>, (&#964;&#8034;&#962; &#945;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&#962;,) is put in the place of an adjective, and refers to both terms; so that, while it literally runs, <i>in righteousness and holiness of truth,</i> the meaning is, <i>in true righteousness and</i> <i>holiness.</i> He warns us that both ought to be sincere; because we have to 		do with God, whom it is impossible to deceive.</p>  <a name="iv.v.vii"></A>

<p><a name="iv.v.vii-p12"></A><b>25.</b> <i>Wherefore, putting away lying.</i> From this head of doctrine, that is, from the righteousness of the new man, all godly exhortations flow, like streams from a fountain; for if all the precepts which relate to life were collected, yet, without this principle, they would be of little value. Philosophers take a different method; but, in the doctrine 		of godliness, there is no other way than this for regulating the life. Now, therefore, he comes to lay down particular exhortations, drawn from the general doctrine. Having concluded from the truth of the gospel, that righteousness and holiness ought to be true, he now argues from the general statement to a particular instance, that <i>every man should speak truth with his neighbour. Lying</i> is here put for every kind of 		deceit, hypocrisy, or cunning; and <i>truth</i> for honest dealing. He demands that every kind of communication between them shall be sincere; and enforces it by this consideration, <i>for we are members one of another</i>.

<p><a name="iv.v.vii-p14"></A><b>26.</b> <i>Be ye angry, and sin not.</i> Whether or not the apostle had in his eye a part of the fourth Psalm is uncertain. The words used by him (&#8127;&#927;&#961;&#947;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#965;&#8052; &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8049;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#949;) occur in the Greek translation, though the word &#8000;&#961;&#947;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#949;, which is translated, 		<i>be ye angry,</i> is considered by some to mean <i>tremble. </i>  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">150</FONT></A>
 		 The Hebrew verb <a name="iv.v.vii-p15.2"></A>&#1494;&#1490;&#1512; (<i>ragaz</i>) signifies either to be agitated by anger, or, to tremble. As to the passage of the Psalm, the idea of <i>trembling</i> will be quite appropriate. &#8220;Do not choose to resemble madmen, who 		rush fearlessly in any direction, but let the dread of being accounted foolhardy keep you in awe.&#8221; The word sometimes signifies to <i>strive</i> or <i>quarrel</i>, as, in that instance, (<a name="iv.v.vii-p15.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#024">Ge 45:24</a><a name="iv.v.vii-p15.3"></A>,) &#8220;See that ye <i>fall not out</i> by the way;&#8221; and accordingly, the Psalmist adds, &#8220;Commune with your own heart, and be still,&#8221; &#8212; abstain from furious encounters.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.vii-p16"></A>In my opinion, Paul merely alludes to the passage with the following view. There are three faults by which we offend God in being angry. The first is, when our anger arises from slight causes, and often from no cause whatever, or at least from private injuries or offenses. The second is, when we go beyond the proper bounds, and are hurried into intemperate excesses. The third is, when our anger, which ought to have been 		directed against ourselves or against sins, is turned against our brethren. Most appropriately, therefore, did Paul, when he wished to describe the proper limitation of anger, employ the well-known passage<i>, Be ye angry, and sin not. </i>We comply with this injunction, if the objects of our anger are sought, not in others, but in ourselves, &#8212; if we pour out our indignation against our own faults. With respect to others, we ought to be angry, not at 		their persons, but at their faults; nor ought we to be excited to anger by private offenses, but by zeal for the glory of the Lord. Lastly, our anger, after a reasonable time, ought to be allowed to subside, without mixing itself with the violence of carnal passions.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.vii-p17"></A><i>Let not the sun go down.</i> It is scarcely possible, however, but that we shall sometimes give way to improper and sinful passion, &#8212; so strong is the tendency of the human mind to what is evil. Paul therefore suggests a second remedy, that we shall quickly suppress our anger, and not suffer it to gather strength by continuance. The first remedy was, <i>Be ye angry, and sin 		not;</i> but, as the great weakness of human nature renders this exceedingly difficult, the next is &#8212; not to cherish wrath too long in our minds, or allow it sufficient time to become strong. He enjoins accordingly, <i>let not the sun go down upon your wrath.</i> If at any time we happen to be angry, let us endeavor to be appeased before the sun has set.</p>

Erasmus, who translates it, &#8220;neither give place to the Slanderer,&#8221; (<a name="iv.v.vii-p19.1"></A><i>calumniatori</i><i>,</i>) shews plainly that he understood it as referring to malicious men. But I have no doubt, Paul&#8217;s intention was, to guard us against allowing Satan to take possession of our minds, and, by keeping in his hands this citadel, to do whatever he pleases. 		We feel every day how impossible, or, at least, how difficult it is to cure long-continued hatred. What is the cause of this, but that, instead of resisting the devil, we yield up to him the possession of our heart? Before the poison of hatred has found its way into the heart, anger must be thoroughly dislodged.</p>

<p><a name="iv.v.vii-p21"></A><b>28.</b> <i>Let him that stole steal no more.</i> This includes not merely the grosser thefts which are punished by human laws, but those of a more concealed nature, which do not fall under the cognizance of men, &#8212; every kind of depredation by which we seize the property of others. But he does not simply forbid us to take that property in an unjust or 		unlawful manner. He enjoins us to assist our brethren, as far as lies in our power.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.vii-p22"></A><i>That he may have to give to him that needeth.</i> &#8220;Thou who formerly stolest must not only obtain thy subsistence by lawful and harmless toil, but must give assistance to others.&#8221; He is first required <i>to labor, working with his hands,</i> that he may not supply his wants at the expense of his brethren, but may support life by honorable labor. But the love which we owe to our neighbor carries us much farther. No one must live to himself alone, and neglect others. All must labor to supply each other&#8217;s necessities.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.vii-p23"></A>But a question arises, does Paul oblige all men to labor with their hands? This would be excessively hard. I reply, the meaning is plain, if it be duly considered. Every man is forbidden to steal. But many people are in the habit of pleading want, and that excuse is obviated by enjoining them<i> rather to labor</i> (&#956;&#8118;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#949; &#954;&#959;&#960;&#953;&#8049;&#964;&#969;) with their hands. As if he had said, &#8220;No condition, however hard or disagreeable, can entitle any man to do injury to another, or even to refrain from contributing to the necessities of his brethren.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.vii-p24"></A><i>The thing which is good.</i> This latter clause, which contains an argument from the greater to the less, gives no small additional strength to the exhortation. As there are many occupations which do little to promote the lawful enjoyments of men, he recommends to them to choose those employments which yield the greatest advantage to their neighbors. We need not wonder at this. If those trades which 		can have no other effect than to lead men into immorality, were denounced by heathens &#8212; and Cicero among the number &#8212; as highly disgraceful, would an apostle of Christ reckon them among the lawful callings of God?</p>  <a name="iv.v.viii"></A>

Whatever is contrary to 		godliness is not only disrelished by godly ears, but is no sooner heard than it produces in them deep grief and pain. But that Paul&#8217;s meaning was different appears from what follows.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.viii-p14"></A><i>By whom ye are sealed.</i> As God has sealed us by his Spirit, we grieve him when we do not follow his guidance, but pollute ourselves by wicked passions. No language can adequately express this solemn truth, that the Holy Spirit rejoices and is glad on our account, when we are obedient to him in all things, and neither think nor speak anything, but what is pure and holy; and, on the other hand, is 		grieved, when we admit anything into our minds that is unworthy of our calling. Now, let any man reflect what shocking wickedness there must be in grieving the Holy Spirit to such a degree as to compel him to withdraw from us. The same mode of speaking is used by the prophet Isaiah, but in a different sense; for he merely says, that they &#8220;vexed his Holy Spirit,&#8221; (<a name="iv.v.viii-p14.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010">Isa 63:10</a><a name="iv.v.viii-p14.1"></A>.) in the same sense in which we are accustomed to speak of vexing the mind of a man. <i>By whom ye are sealed.</i> The Spirit of God is the seal, by which we are distinguished from the wicked, and which is impressed on our hearts as a sure evidence of 		adoption.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.viii-p15"></A><i>Unto the day of redemption,</i> &#8212; that is, till God conduct us into the possession of the promised inheritance. That day is usually called <i>the day of redemption,</i> because we shall then be at length delivered out of all our afflictions.

Between <i>wrath and anger</i> (&#920;&#965;&#956;&#8056;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8000;&#961;&#947;&#8052;&#957;) there is 		little difference, except that the former denotes the power, and the latter the act; but here, the only difference is, that <i>anger</i> is a more sudden attack. The correction of all the rest will be greatly aided by the removal of <i>malice.</i> By this term he expresses that depravity of mind which is opposed to humanity and justice, and which is usually called <i>malignity.</i></p>  <a name="iv.v.ix"></A>

<p><a name="iv.v.ix-p6"></A><b>32.</b> <i>And be ye kind one to another.</i> With <i>bitterness</i> he contrasts <i>kindness,</i> or gentleness of countenance, language, and manners. And as this virtue will never reign in us, unless attended by <i>compassion,</i> 		(&#959;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#8049;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;,) he recommends to us to be <i>tender-hearted</i>  This will lead us not only to sympathize with the distresses of our brethren, as if they were our own, but to cultivate that true humanity which is affected by everything that happens to them, in the same manner as if we were in their situation. The contrary of this is the cruelty of those iron-hearted, barbarous men, 		by whom the sufferings of others are beheld without any concern whatever.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.v.ix-p7"></A><i>Forgiving one another.</i> The Greek word here rendered<i> forgiving,</i> (&#967;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#950;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;,) is supposed by to mean beneficence. Erasmus, accordingly, renders it (<a name="iv.v.ix-p7.1"></A><i>largientes</i>) <i>bountiful.</i> Though the word admits of that meaning, yet the context induces me to prefer the other view, that we should be ready to <i>forgive</i>  It may sometimes happen, that men are <i>kind</i> and <i>tender-hearted,</i> and yet, when they receive improper treatment, do not so 		easily forgive injuries. That those whose kindness of heart in other respects disposes them to acts of humanity, may not fail in their duty through the ingratitude of men, he exhorts them to discover a readiness to lay aside resentment. To give his exhortation the greater weight, he holds out the example of God, who has forgiven to us, through Christ, far more than any mortal man can forgive to his brethren.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_151"></A><A HREF="#fn_151"><FONT SIZE="1">152</FONT></A>
