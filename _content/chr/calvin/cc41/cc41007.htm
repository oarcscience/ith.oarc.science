<p><a name="iii.v.i-p14"></A><b>1.</b> <i>O foolish Galatians</i>. An expostulation is here interwoven &#8212; I should rather say, inserted &#8212; amidst his doctrinal statements. Some will wonder that he did not delay it to the close of the Epistle, but the very serious nature of the errors which he has brought forward unquestionably roused him to a burst of passion. When we hear that the Son of 		God, with all his benefits, is rejected, that his death is esteemed as nothing, what pious mind would not break out into indignation? He therefore declares that those who allowed themselves to be involved in so heinous a crime must have been &#7936;&#957;&#8057;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#953;, that is, &#8220;disordered in mind.&#8221; He accuses them not only of having suffered themselves to be deceived, but of having been carried away by some sort of magical enchantment,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">54</FONT></A>
 		 which is a still more serious charge. He insinuates that their fall partook more of madness than of folly.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.i-p16"></A>Some think that Paul refers to the temper of the nation, that, being sprung from barbarians, it was more difficult to train them; but I rather think that he refers to the subject itself. It looks like something supernatural, that, after enjoying the gospel in such clearness, they should be affected by the delusions of Satan. He does not merely say that they were &#8220;bewitched&#8221; and &#8220;disordered in mind,&#8221; because they did not 		obey the truth; but because, after having received instruction so clear, so full, so tender, and so powerful, they immediately fell away. Erasmus has chosen to interpret the words, &#8220;that ye should not <i>believe</i> the truth.&#8221; I am not quite prepared to set aside that rendering, but would prefer the word <i>obey</i>, because Paul does not charge them with having, from the outset, rejected the gospel, but with 		not having persevered in obedience.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.i-p17"></A><i>Before whose eyes</i>. This is intended, as I have already hinted, to express an aggravation; for, the better opportunities they had of knowing Christ, the more heinous was the criminality of forsaking him. Such, he tells them, was the clearness of his doctrine, that it was not naked doctrine, but the express, living image of Christ.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">55</FONT></A>
 		 They had known Christ in such a manner, that they might be almost said to have seen him.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.i-p19"></A><i>Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth</i>. Augustine&#8217;s interpretation of the word &#960;&#961;&#959;&#949;&#947;&#961;&#8049;&#966;&#951;, (&#8220;hath been set forth,&#8221;) is harsh, and inconsistent with Paul&#8217;s design. He makes it to signify that Christ was to be thrust out from possession. Others propose a different phrase, (<i>proscriptus</i>,) which, if 		used in the sense of &#8220;openly proclaimed,&#8221; would not be inapplicable. The Greeks, accordingly, borrow from this verb the word &#960;&#961;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#8049;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;, to denote boards on which property intended to be sold was published, so as to be exposed to the view of all. But the participle, <i>painted</i>, is less ambiguous, and, in my own opinion, is exceedingly appropriate. To shew how energetic his preaching was, Paul first 		compares it to a picture, which exhibited to them, in a lively manner, the image of Christ.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.i-p20"></A>But, not satisfied with this comparison, he adds, <i>Christ hath been crucified among you,</i> intimating that the actual sight of Christ&#8217;s death could not have affected them more powerfully than his own preaching. The view given by some, that the Galatians had &#8220;crucified to themselves (<a name="iii.v.i-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#006">Heb 6:6</a><a name="iii.v.i-p20.1"></A>) the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame;&#8221; that they had withdrawn from the purity of the gospel; or, at least, had lent their ear, and given their confidence, to impostors who crucified him, &#8212; appears to me overstrained. The meaning therefore is, that Paul&#8217;s doctrine had instructed them concerning Christ in such a manner as if he had been exhibited to them in a picture, nay, &#8220;crucified among them.&#8221; Such a representation could not have been made by 		any eloquence, or by &#8220;enticing words of man&#8217;s wisdom,&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.i-p20.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004">1Co 2:4</a><a name="iii.v.i-p20.2"></A>,) had it not been accompanied by that power of the Spirit, of which Paul has treated largely in both the Epistles to the Corinthians.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.i-p21"></A>Let those who would discharge aright the ministry of the gospel learn, not merely to speak and declaim, but to penetrate into the consciences of men, to make them see Christ crucified, and feel the shedding of his blood.  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">56</FONT></A>
 		When the Church has painters such as these, she no longer needs the dead images of wood and stone, she no longer requires pictures; both of which, unquestionably, were first admitted to Christian temples when the pastors had become dumb and been converted into mere idols, or when they uttered a few words from the pulpit in such a cold and careless manner, that the power and efficacy of the ministry were utterly extinguished.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.v.i-p23"></A><a name="iii.v.i-p23.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.i-p24"></A><b>2.</b> <i>This one I wish to learn from you.</i> He now proceeds to support his cause by additional arguments. The first is drawn from their experience, for he reminds them in what manner the gospel was introduced among themselves. When they heard the gospel, they received the Spirit. It was not to the law, therefore, but to faith, that they owed the 		reception of this benefit. This same argument is employed by Peter in the defense which he makes to his brethren for having baptized uncircumcised persons. (<a name="iii.v.i-p24.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#047">Ac 10:47</a><a name="iii.v.i-p24.1"></A>.) Paul and Barnabas followed the same course in the debate which they maintained at Jerusalem on this subject. (<a name="iii.v.i-p24.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#002">Acts 15:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#012">12</a><a name="iii.v.i-p24.2"></A>.) There was therefore manifest ingratitude in not submitting to the doctrine, by means of which they had received the Holy Spirit. The opportunity which he gives them to reply is expressive not of doubt, but of greater confidence: for their convictions, founded on their own experience, forced them to acknowledge that it was true.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.i-p25"></A><i>Faith</i> is here put, by a figure of speech, for the gospel, which is elsewhere called &#8220;the law of faith,&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.i-p25.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027">Ro 3:27</a><a name="iii.v.i-p25.1"></A>,) because it exhibits to us the free grace of God in Christ, without any merit of works. <i>The Spirit</i> means here, I think, the 		grace of regeneration, which is common to all believers; though I have no objection to understand it as referring to the peculiar gifts by which the Lord, at that period, honored the preaching of the gospel.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">57</FONT></A>
</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.i-p27"></A>It may be objected, that the Spirit was not, in this respect, given to all. But, it was enough for Paul&#8217;s purpose, that the Galatians knew that the power of the Holy Spirit in his Church had accompanied Paul&#8217;s doctrine, and that believers were variously endowed with the gifts of the Spirit for general edification. It may likewise be objected, that those gifts were not infallible signs of adoption, and so do not apply to the present 		question. I reply, that it was enough that the Lord had confirmed the doctrine of Paul by the visible gifts of his Spirit. A still simpler view of the case is, that they had been distinguished by the ordinary privilege of adoption, before those impostors had brought forward their additions. &#8220;In whom,&#8221; says he to the Ephesians,</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.i-p28"></A>&#8220;ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.i-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013">Eph 1:13</a><a name="iii.v.i-p28.1"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.v.i-p29"></A><a name="iii.v.i-p29.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.i-p30"></A><b>3.</b> <i>Are ye so foolish?</i> Commentators are not agreed as to what he means by <i>the Spirit</i> and by <i>the flesh</i>. He alludes, in my opinion, to what he had said about the Spirit. As if he had said, &#8220;As the doctrine of the gospel brought to you the Holy Spirit, 		the commencement of your course was spiritual; but now ye have fallen into a worse condition, and may be said to have fallen from the Spirit into the flesh.&#8221; The flesh denotes either outward and fading flyings, such as ceremonies are, particularly when they are separated from Christ; or it denotes dead and fading doctrine. There was a strange inconsistency between their splendid commencement and their future progress.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.v.i-p31"></A><a name="iii.v.i-p31.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.i-p32"></A><b>4.</b> <i>Have ye suffered so many things?</i> This is another argument. Having suffered so many things in behalf of the gospel, would they now, in an instant, lose it all? Nay, he puts it in the way of reproach, if they were willing to lose the advantage of so many illustrious struggles which they had made for the faith. If the true faith had not been 		delivered to them by Paul, it was rash to suffer anything in defense of a bad cause; but they had experienced the presence of God amidst their persecutions. Accordingly, he charges the false apostles with ill-will in depriving the Galatians of such valuable ornaments. But to mitigate the severity of this complaint, he adds, <i>if it be yet in vain</i>; thus inspiring their minds with the expectation of something better, and rousing them to the exercise 		of repentance. For the intention of all chastisement is, not to drive men to despair, but to lead them to a better course.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.v.i-p33"></A><a name="iii.v.i-p33.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.i-p34"></A><b>5.</b> <i>He therefore that ministereth</i>. He is not now speaking of the grace of regeneration, but of the other gifts of the Spirit; for a subject different from the preceding one is manifestly introduced. He warns them that all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, in which they excelled, are the fruits of the gospel, of that gospel which had been preached among 		them by his own lips. Their new teachers deprived them of those gifts when they left the gospel, and fled to another kind of doctrine. In proportion to the value which they attached to those gifts, to which the apostle here adds <i>miracles</i>, they ought the more carefully and resolutely to adhere to the gospel.</p>  <a name="iii.v.ii"></A>  	  		 		     		  
<p class="TableCaption15"><a name="iii.v.ii-p1"></A><a name="iii.v.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#006">Galatians 3:6-9</a><a name="iii.v.ii-p1.1"></A></p> 		    		 		     		  
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p2"></A><b>6.</b> Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</p> 		     		  
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p3"></A><b>6.</b> Quemadmodum Abraham credidit Deo, et imputatum est illi in justitiam.

<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p4"></A><b>7.</b> Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</p> 		     		  
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p5"></A><b>7.</b> Cognoscite ergo, quod qui ex fide sunt, ii sunt filii Abrahae.</p> 		    		 		     		  
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p6"></A><b>8.</b> And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, <i>saying</i>, In thee shall all nations be blessed.</p> 		     		  
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p7"></A><b>8.</b> Scriptura autem, quia praevidebat, quod ex fide justificet Deus Gentes, ante evangelizavit Abrahae: In to benedicentur omnes Gentes. (<a name="iii.v.ii-p7.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018">Ge 22:18</a><a name="iii.v.ii-p7.1"></A>.)</p> 		    		 		     		  
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p8"></A><b>9.</b> So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</p> 		     		  
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p9"></A><b>9.</b> Itaque qui ex fide sunt, benedicuntur cure fideli Abraham.</p> 		    		  	   	 
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p10"></A>&nbsp;</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.v.ii-p11"></A><a name="iii.v.ii-p11.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p12"></A>Having appealed to facts and experience, he now gives quotations from Scripture. And first, he brings forward the example of Abraham. Arguments drawn from examples are not always so conclusive, but this is one of the most powerful, because neither in the subject nor in the person is there any ground of exception. There is no variety of roads to righteousness, and so Abraham is called &#8220;the father of all them that believe,&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.ii-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011">Ro 4:11</a><a name="iii.v.ii-p12.1"></A>,) because he is a pattern adapted to all; nay, in his person has been laid down to us the universal rule for obtaining righteousness.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p13"></A>6. <i>Even as Abraham</i>. We must here supply some such phrase as <i>but rather</i>; for, having put a question, he resolved instantly to cut off every ground of hesitation. At least the phrase &#8220;<i>even as</i>,&#8221; (&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8060;&#962;,) refers only to the 		verse immediately preceding, to the &#8220;ministration of the Spirit and of miracles by the hearing of faith;&#8221; as if he had said, that, in the grace bestowed on them, a similarity might be found to the case of Abraham.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p14"></A><i>Believed God</i>. By this quotation he proves both here, and in the 4th chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, that men are justified by faith, because the faith of Abraham <i>was accounted to him, for righteousness</i>. (<a name="iii.v.ii-p14.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003">Ro 4:3</a><a name="iii.v.ii-p14.1"></A>.) We must here 		inquire briefly, first, what Paul intends by <i>faith</i>; secondly, what is <i>righteousness</i>; and thirdly, why faith is represented to be a cause of justification. Faith does not mean any kind of conviction which men may have of the truth of God; for though Cain had a hundred times exercised faith in God when denouncing punishment against him, this had nothing to do with obtaining righteousness. Abraham 		was justified by believing, because, when he received from God a promise of fatherly kindness, he embraced it as certain. Faith therefore has a relation and respect to such a divine promise as may enable men to place their trust and confidence in God.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p15"></A>As to the word <i>righteousness</i>, we must attend to the phraseology of Moses. When he says, that</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.v.ii-p16"></A>&#8220;he believed in the Lord,<br> 		and he counted it to him for righteousness,&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.ii-p16.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006">Ge 15:6</a><a name="iii.v.ii-p16.2"></A>,)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p17"></A>he intimates that that person is righteous who is reckoned as such in the sight of God. Now, since men have not righteousness dwelling within themselves, they obtain this by imputation; because God holds their faith as accounted for righteousness. We are therefore said to be &#8220;justified by faith,&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.ii-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028">Rom. 3:28</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001">Rom. 5:1</a><a name="iii.v.ii-p17.1"></A>,) not because faith 		infuses into us a habit or quality, but because we are accepted by God.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p18"></A>But why does faith receive such honor as to be entitled a cause of our justification? First, we must observe, that it is merely an instrumental cause; for, strictly speaking, our righteousness is nothing else than God&#8217;s free acceptance of us, on which our salvation is founded. But as the Lord testifies his love and grace in the gospel, by offering to us that righteousness of which I have spoken, so we receive it by faith. And thus, when 		we ascribe to faith a man&#8217;s justification, we are not treating of the principal cause, but merely pointing out the way in which men arrive at true righteousness. For this righteousness is not a quality which exists in men, but is the mere gift of God, and is enjoyed by faith only; and not even as a reward justly due to faith, but because we receive by faith what God freely gives. All such expressions as the following are of similar import: We are &#8220;justified freely by his grace.&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.ii-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024">Ro 3:24</a><a name="iii.v.ii-p18.1"></A>.) Christ is our righteousness. The mercy of God is the cause of our righteousness. By the death and resurrection of Christ, righteousness has been procured for us. Righteousness is bestowed on us through the gospel. We obtain righteousness by faith.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p19"></A>Hence appears the ridiculousness of the blunder of attempting to reconcile the two propositions, that we are justified by faith, and that we are justified at the same time by works; for he who is &#8220;just by faith&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.ii-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004">Hab 2:4</a><a name="iii.v.ii-p19.1"></A> <a name="iii.v.ii-p19.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038">Heb 10:38</a><a name="iii.v.ii-p19.2"></A>) is poor and destitute of 		personal righteousness, and relies on the grace of God alone. And this is the reason why Paul, in the Epistle to the Romans, concludes that Abraham, having obtained righteousness by faith, had no right to glory before God. (<a name="iii.v.ii-p19.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#002">Ro 4:2</a><a name="iii.v.ii-p19.3"></A>.) For it is not said that faith was imputed to him for a part of righteousness, but simply for righteousness; so that his faith was truly his righteousness. Besides, faith looks at 		nothing but the mercy of God, and a dead and risen Christ. All merit of works is thus excluded from being the cause of justification, when the whole is ascribed to faith. For faith, &#8212; so far as it embraces the undeserved goodness of God, Christ with all his benefits, the testimony of our adoption which is contained in the gospel, &#8212; is universally contrasted with the law, with the merit of works, and with human excellence. The notion of the sophists, that it is contrasted with ceremonies alone, 		will presently be disproved, with little difficulty, from the context. Let us therefore remember, that those who are righteous by faith, are righteous out of themselves, that is, in Christ.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p20"></A>Hence, too, we obtain a refutation of the idle cavilling of certain persons who evade Paul&#8217;s reasoning. Moses they tell us, gives the name of righteousness to goodness; and so means nothing more than that Abraham was reckoned a good man, because he believed God. Giddy minds of this description, raised up in our time by Satan, endeavor, by indirect slanders, to undermine the certainty of Scripture. Paul knew that Moses was not there giving 		lessons to boys in grammar, but was speaking of a decision which God had pronounced, and very properly viewed the word righteousness in a theological sense. For it is not in that sense in which goodness is mentioned with approbation among men, that we are accounted righteous in the sight of God, but only where we render perfect obedience to the law. Righteousness is contrasted with the transgression of the law, even in its smallest point; and because we have it not from ourselves, it is freely 		given to us by God.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p21"></A>But here the Jews object that Paul has completely tortured the words of Moses to suit his own purpose; for Moses does not here treat of Christ, or of eternal life, but only mentions an earthly inheritance. The Papists are not very different from the Jews; for, though they do not venture to inveigh against Paul, they entirely evade his meaning. Paul, we reply, takes for granted, what Christians hold to be a first principle, that whatever 		promises the Lord made to Abraham were appendages of that first promise,</p>

Unbelievers differ from the children of God in this respect, that, while they enjoy in common with them the bounties of Providence, they devour them like cattle, and look no higher. 		The children of God, on the other hand, knowing that all their blessings have been sanctified by the promises, acknowledge God in them as their Father. They are often directed, in this way, to the hope of eternal life; for they begin with the faith of their adoption, which is the foundation of the whole.

 		 He says that those &#8220;are of faith,&#8221; who have relinquished all confidence in works, and rely on the promise of God alone. It is on the authority of Paul himself that we give this interpretation; for in the Epistle to the Romans he thus writes:</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p29"></A>&#8220;To him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.

<p><a name="iii.v.ii-p30"></A>To be <i>of faith</i>, therefore, is to rest their righteousness and hope of salvation on the mercy of God.

He has omitted one remark, which will be readily supplied, that there is no place in 		the church for any man who is not a son of Abraham.</p>

<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p14"></A><b>10.</b> <i>For as many as are of the works of the law</i>. The argument is drawn from the contradictory nature of the two schemes; for the same fountain does not yield both hot and cold. The law holds all living men under its curse; and from the law, therefore, it is in vain to expect a blessing. They are declared to be <i>of the works 		of the law</i> who place their trust for salvation in those works; for such modes of expression must always be interpreted by the state of the question. Now, we know that the controversy here relates to righteousness. All who wish to be justified by the works of the law are declared to be liable to the curse. But how does he prove this? The sentence of the law is, that all who have transgressed any part of the law are cursed. Let us now see if there be any living man who 		fulfils the law. But no such person, it is evident, has been, or ever can be found. All to a man are here condemned. The minor and the conclusion are wanting, for the entire syllogism would run thus: &#8220;Whoever has come short in any part of the law is cursed; all are held chargeable with this guilt; therefore all are cursed.&#8221; This argument of Paul would not stand, if we had sufficient strength to fulfill the law; for there would then be a fatal objection to the minor proposition. Either Paul 		reasons badly, or it is impossible for men to fulfill the law.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p15"></A>An antagonist might now object: &#8220;I admit that all transgressors are accursed; what then? Men will be found who keep the law; for they are free to choose good or evil.&#8221; But Paul places here beyond controversy, what the Papists at this day hold to be a detestable doctrine, that men are destitute of strength to keep the law. And so he concludes boldly that all are cursed, because all have been commanded to keep the law perfectly; which 		implies that in the present corruption of our nature the power of keeping it perfectly is wanting. Hence we conclude that the curse which the law pronounces, though, in the phrase of logicians, it is <i>accidental</i>, is here perpetual and inseparable from its nature. The blessing which it offers to us is excluded by our depravity, so that the curse alone remains.</p>

<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p17"></A><b>11.</b> <i>But that no man, is justified by the law</i>. He again argues from a comparison of contradictory schemes. &#8220;If we are justified by faith, it is not by the law: but we are justified by faith therefore it is not by the law.&#8221; The minor is proved by a passage from Habakkuk, which is also quoted in the Epistle to the Romans. (<a name="iii.v.iii-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004">Hab 2:4</a><a name="iii.v.iii-p17.1"></A>; <a name="iii.v.iii-p17.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017">Ro 1:17</a><a name="iii.v.iii-p17.2"></A>.) The major is proved by the difference in the methods of justification. The law justifies him who fulfils all its precepts, while faith justifies those who are destitute of the merit of works, and who rely on Christ alone. To be justified by our own merit, and to be 		justified by the grace of another, are two schemes which cannot be reconciled: one of them must be overturned by the other. Such is the amount of the argument: let us now attend to the separate clauses.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p18"></A><i>The just shall live by faith</i>. As we had occasion to expound this passage where it occurs in the Epistle to the Romans, it will be unnecessary to repeat the exposition of it here. The prophet evidently describes a proud confidence in the flesh as contrasted with true faith. He declares, that &#8220;the just shall live;&#8221; by which he means, not that they are supported for a short 		period, and liable to be overwhelmed by an approaching storm; but that they shall continue to live, and that, even amidst the most imminent danger, their life shall be preserved. There is therefore no weight in the scornful reproaches of our adversaries, who allege that the prophet there employs the word Faith in a wider acceptation than Paul does in this passage. By Faith he evidently means the exercise of a calm, steady conscience, relying on God alone; so that Paul&#8217;s quotation is properly 		applied.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.v.iii-p19"></A><a name="iii.v.iii-p19.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p20"></A><b>12.</b> <i>And the law is not of faith</i>. The law evidently is not contrary to faith; otherwise God would be unlike himself; but we must return to a principle already noticed, that Paul&#8217;s language is modified by the present aspect of the case. The contradiction between the law and faith lies in the matter of justification. You will more easily unite fire 		and water, than reconcile these two statements, that men are justified by faith, and that they are justified by the law. &#8220;The law is not of faith;&#8221; that is, it has a method of justifying a man which is wholly at variance with faith.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p21"></A><i>But the man who shall do these things.</i> The difference lies in this, that man, when he fulfils the law, is reckoned righteous by a legal righteousness, which he proves by a quotation from Moses. (<a name="iii.v.iii-p21.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005">Le 18:5</a><a name="iii.v.iii-p21.1"></A>.) Now, what is the righteousness of faith? He defines it in the Epistle to 		the Romans,</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p22"></A>&#8220;If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead,<br> 		thou shalt be saved.&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.iii-p22.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009">Ro 10:9</a><a name="iii.v.iii-p22.2"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p23"></A>And yet it does not follow from this, that faith is inactive, or that it sets believers free from good works. For the present question is not, whether believers ought to keep the law as far as they can, (which is beyond all doubt,) but whether they can obtain righteousness by works, which is impossible. But since God promises life to the doers of the law, why does Paul affirm that they are not righteous? The reply to this objection is 		easy. There are none righteous by the works of the law, because there are none who do those works. We admit that the doers of the law, if there were any such, are righteous; but since that is a conditional agreement, all are excluded from life, because no man performs that righteousness which he ought. We must bear in memory what I have already stated, that to do the law is not to obey it in part, but to fulfill everything which belongs to righteousness; and all are at the greatest distance 		from such perfection.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.v.iii-p24"></A><a name="iii.v.iii-p24.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p25"></A><b>13.</b> <i>Christ hath redeemed us</i>. The apostle had made all who are under the law subject to the curse; from which arose this great difficulty, that the Jews could not free themselves from the curse of the law. Having stated this difficulty, he meets it, by shewing that Christ hath made us free, which still farther aids his purpose. If we are saved, 		because we have been freed from the curse of the law, then righteousness is not by the law. He next points out the manner in which we are made free.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p26"></A><i>It is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree</i>. Now, Christ hung upon the cross, therefore he fell under that curse. But it is certain that he did not suffer that punishment on his own account. It follows, therefore, either that he was crucified in vain, or that our curse was laid upon him, in order that we might be delivered from it. Now, he does not say that Christ was cursed, but, 		which is still more, that he was <i>a curse</i>, &#8212; intimating, that the curse &#8220;of all men   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_58"><FONT SIZE="1">59</FONT></A>
 		 was laid upon him&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.iii-p27.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006">Isa 53:6</a><a name="iii.v.iii-p27.2"></A>.) If any man think this language harsh, let him be ashamed of the cross of Christ, in the confession of which we glory. It was not unknown to God what death his own Son would die, when he pronounced the law, &#8220;He that is hanged is accursed of God.&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.iii-p27.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023">De 21:23</a><a name="iii.v.iii-p27.3"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iii-p28"></A>But how does it happen, it will be asked, that a beloved Son is cursed by his Father? We reply, there are two things which must be considered, not only in the person of Christ, but even in his human nature. The one is, that he was the unspotted Lamb of God, full of blessing and of grace; the other is, that he placed himself in our room, and thus became a sinner, and subject to the curse, not in himself indeed, but in us, yet in such a 		manner, that it became necessary for him to occupy our place. He could not cease to be the object of his Father&#8217;s love, and yet he endured his wrath. For how could he reconcile the Father to us, if he had incurred his hatred and displeasure? We conclude, that he &#8220;did always those things that pleased&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.iii-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#029">Joh 8:29</a><a name="iii.v.iii-p28.1"></A>) his Father. Again, how would he have freed us from the wrath of God, if he had not transferred it 		from us to himself?

Having said that &#8220;Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law&#8221; he now applies that statement more closely to his purpose. The promised blessing of Abraham is founded on this, and flows from it to the Gentiles. If the Jews must be delivered from the law, in order to become the heirs of Abraham, what shall 		hinder the Gentiles from obtaining the same benefit?

The case is different with the Epistle to the Hebrews, where the apostle 		unquestionably alludes to testaments, (<a name="iii.v.iv-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016">Heb. 9:16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#017">17</a><a name="iii.v.iv-p13.1"></A>;) but here I prefer to take it simply for the covenant which God made. The analogy from which the apostle argues, would not apply so strictly to a testament as to a covenant. The apostle appears to reason from human bargains to that solemn covenant into which God entered with Abraham. If human bargains be so 		firm that they can receive no addition, how much more must this covenant remain inviolable?</p>

<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p15"></A><b>16.</b> <i>Now to Abraham, and his seed</i>. Before pursuing his argument, he introduces an observation about the substance of the covenant, that it rests on Christ alone. But if Christ be the foundation of the bargain, it follows that it is of free grace; and this too is the meaning of the word <i>promise</i>. As 		the law has respect to men and to their works, so the promise has respect to the grace of God and to faith.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p16"></A><i>He saith not, And to seeds.</i> To prove that in this place God speaks of Christ, he calls attention to the singular number as denoting some particular seed. I have often been astonished that Christians, when they saw this passage so perversely tortured by the Jews, did not make a more determined resistance; for all pass it slightly as if it were an indisputed territory. And yet there is much 		plausibility in their objection. Since the word <i>seed</i> is a collective noun, Paul appears to reason inconclusively, when he contends that a single individual is denoted by this word, under which all the descendants of Abraham are comprehended in a passage already quoted, &#8220;In multiplying I will multiply thy seed, <a name="iii.v.iv-p16.1"></A>&#1506;&#1512;&#1494; (<i>zerang</i>,) or <a name="iii.v.iv-p16.2"></A>&#1498;&#1506;&#1512;&#1494; (<i>zargnacha</i>,) as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea-shore.&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.iv-p16.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017">Ge 22:17</a><a name="iii.v.iv-p16.3"></A>.) Having, as they imagine, detected the fallacy of the argument, they 		treat us with haughty triumph.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p17"></A>I am the more surprised that our own writers should have been silent on this head, as we have abundant means of repelling their slander. Among Abraham&#8217;s own sons a division began, for one of the sons was cut off from the family. &#8220;In Isaac shall thy seed be called.&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.iv-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012">Ge 21:12</a><a name="iii.v.iv-p17.1"></A>.) Consequently Ishmael is not included in the reckoning. Let us come a 		step lower. Do the Jews allow that the posterity of Esau are the blessed seed? nay, it will be maintained that their father, though the first-born, was struck off. And how many nations have sprung from the stock of Abraham who have no share in this &#8220;calling?&#8221; The twelve patriarchs, at length, formed twelve heads, not because they were descended from the line of Abraham, but because they had been appointed by a particular election of God. Since the ten tribes were carried away, (<a name="iii.v.iv-p17.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#017">Ho 9:17</a><a name="iii.v.iv-p17.2"></A>,) how many thousands have so degenerated that they no longer hold a name among the seed of Abraham? Lastly, a trial was made of the tribe of Judah, that the real succession to the blessing might be transmitted among a small people. And this had been predicted by Isaiah,</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.v.iv-p18"></A>&#8220;Though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea,<br> 		yet a remnant of them shall return.&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.iv-p18.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022">Isa 10:22</a><a name="iii.v.iv-p18.2"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p19"></A>Hitherto I have said nothing which the Jews themselves do not acknowledge. Let them answer me then; how comes it that the thirteen tribes sprung from the twelve patriarchs were the seed of Abraham, in preference to Ishmaelites and Edomites? Why do they exclusively glory in that name, and set aside the others as a spurious seed? They will, no doubt, boast that they have obtained it by their own merit; but Scripture, on the contrary, 		asserts that all depends on the calling of God; for we must constantly return to the privilege conveyed in these words, &#8220;In Isaac shall thy seed be called.&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.iv-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012">Ge 21:12</a><a name="iii.v.iv-p19.1"></A>.) The uninterrupted succession to this privilege must have been in force until Christ; for, in the person of David, the Lord afterwards brought back by recovery, as we might say, the promise which had been made to Abraham. In proving, 		therefore, that this prediction applies to a single individual, Paul does not make his argument rest on the use of the singular number. He merely shews that the word <i>seed</i> must denote one who was not only descended from Abraham according to the flesh, but had been likewise appointed for this purpose by the calling of God. If the Jews deny this, they will only make themselves ridiculous by their obstinacy.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p20"></A>But as Paul likewise argues from these words, that a covenant had been made in Christ, or to Christ, let us inquire into the force of that expression,</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.v.iv-p21"></A>&#8220;In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.&#8221;<br> 		(<a name="iii.v.iv-p21.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018">Ge 22:18</a><a name="iii.v.iv-p21.2"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p22"></A>The Jews taunt the apostle with making a comparison, as if the seed of Abraham were to be quoted as an example in all disastrous omens and prayers; while, on the contrary, to curse in Sodom or Israel is to employ the name of Sodom or Israel in forms of cursing. This, I own, is sometimes the case, but not always; for to bless one&#8217;s self in God has quite a different meaning, as the Jews themselves admit. Since, therefore, the phrase is 		ambiguous, denoting sometimes a cause and sometimes a comparison, wherever, it occurs, it must be explained by the context. We have ascertained, then, that we are all cursed by nature, and that the blessing of Abraham has been promised to all nations. Do all indiscriminately reach it? Certainly not, but those only who are &#8220;gathered&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.iv-p22.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#008">Isa 66:8</a><a name="iii.v.iv-p22.1"></A>) to the Messiah; for when, under His government and direction, 		they are collected into one body, they then become one people. Whoever then, laying disputing aside, shall inquire into the truth, will readily acknowledge that the words here signify not a mere comparison but a cause; and hence it follows that Paul had good ground for saying, that the covenant was made in Christ, or in reference to Christ.</p>

<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p24"></A><b>17.</b> <i>The law which was four hundred and thirty years after</i>. If we listen to Origen and Jerome and all the Papists, there will be little difficulty in refuting this argument. Paul reasons thus: &#8220;A promise was given to Abraham four hundred and thirty years before the publication of the law; therefore the law which came after could not disannul the 		promise; and hence he concludes that ceremonies are not necessary.&#8221; But it may be objected, the sacraments were given in order to preserve the faith, and why should Paul separate them from the promise? He does so separate them, and proceeds to argue on the matter. The ceremonies themselves are not so much considered by him as something higher, &#8212; the effect of justification which was attributed to them by false apostles, and the obligation on the conscience. From ceremonies, accordingly, he 		takes occasion to discuss the whole subject of faith and works. If the point in dispute had no connection with obtaining righteousness, with the merit of works, or with ensnaring the conscience, ceremonies would be quite consistent with the promise.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p25"></A>What, then, is meant by this <i>disannulling</i> of the promise, against which the apostle contends? The impostors denied that salvation is freely promised to men, and received by faith, and, as we shall presently see, urged the necessity of works in order to merit salvation. I return to Paul&#8217;s own language. &#8220;The law,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is later than the promise, and therefore does not revoke it; for a covenant once sanctioned must remain 		perpetually binding.&#8221; I again repeat, if you do not understand that the promise is free, there will be no force in the statement; for the law and the promise are not at variance but on this single point, that the law justifies a man by the merit of works, and the promise bestows righteousness freely. This is made abundantly clear when he calls it a <i>covenant</i> founded on Christ.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p26"></A>But here we shall have the Papists to oppose us, for they will find a ready method of evading this argument. &#8220;We do not require,&#8221; they will say, &#8220;that the old ceremonies shall be any longer binding; let them be laid out of the question; nevertheless a man is justified by the moral law. For this law, which is as old as the creation of man, went before God&#8217;s covenant with Abraham; so that Paul&#8217;s reasoning is either frivolous, or it holds 		against ceremonies alone.&#8221; I answer, Paul took into account what was certainly true, that, except by a covenant with God, no reward is due to works. Admitting, then, that the law justifies, yet before the law men could not merit salvation by works, because there was no covenant. All that I am now affirming is granted by the scholastic theologians: for they maintain that works are meritorious of salvation, not by their intrinsic worth, but by the acceptance of God, (to use their own phrase,) and 		on the ground of a covenant. Consequently, where no divine covenant, no declaration of acceptance is found, &#8212; no works will be available for justification: so that Paul&#8217;s argument is perfectly conclusive. He tells us that God made two covenants with men; one through Abraham, and another through Moses. The former, being founded on Christ, was free; and therefore the law, which came after, could not enable men to obtain salvation otherwise than by grace, for then, &#8220;it would make the promise of 		none effect.&#8221; That this is the meaning appears clearly from what immediately follows.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.v.iv-p27"></A><a name="iii.v.iv-p27.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p28"></A><b>18.</b> <i>If the inheritance be of the law</i>. His opponents might still reply, that nothing was farther from their intention than to weaken or disannul God&#8217;s covenant. To deprive them of every kind of subterfuge, he comes forward with the assertion, that salvation by the law, and salvation by the promise of God, are wholly inconsistent with each other. 		Who will dare to explain this as applying to ceremonies alone, while Paul comprehends under it whatever interferes with a free promise? Beyond all doubt, he excludes works of every description. &#8220;For,&#8221; says he to the Romans,</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.v.iv-p29"></A>&#8220;if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,<br> 		and the promise made of none effect.&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.iv-p29.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014">Ro 4:14</a><a name="iii.v.iv-p29.2"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p30"></A>Why so? Because salvation would be suspended on the condition of satisfying the law; and so he immediately concludes:</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.v.iv-p31"></A>&#8220;Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, in order that the promise might be sure to all the seed.&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.iv-p31.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#016">Ro 4:16</a><a name="iii.v.iv-p31.1"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.iv-p32"></A>Let us carefully remember the reason why, in comparing the promise with the law, the establishment of the one overturns the other. The reason is, that the promise has respect to faith, and the law to works. Faith receives what is freely given, but to works a reward is paid. And he immediately adds, <i>God gave it to Abraham</i>, not by requiring some sort of compensation on his 		part, but by free promise; for if you view it as conditional, the word <i>gave</i>, (&#954;&#949;&#967;&#8049;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953;,) would be utterly inapplicable.</p>  <a name="iii.v.v"></A>

<p><a name="iii.v.v-p12"></A>When we are told that the law has no influence in obtaining justification, various suggestions immediately arise, that it must be either useless, or opposed to God&#8217;s covenant, or something of that sort. Nay, it might occur, why should we not say of the law, what Jeremiah says of the New Testament, (<a name="iii.v.v-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031">Jer 31:31</a><a name="iii.v.v-p12.1"></A>,) that it was given at a later period, 		in order to supply the weakness of the former doctrine? Objections of this kind must be answered, if Paul wished to satisfy the Galatians. First, then, he inquires, &#8212; what is the use of the law? Having come after the promise, it appears to have been intended to supply its defects; and there was room at least for doubting, whether the promise would have been effectual, if it had not been aided by the law. Let it be observed, that Paul does not speak of the moral law only, but of everything 		connected with the office held by Moses. That office, which was peculiar to Moses, consisted in laying down a rule of life and ceremonies to be observed in the worship of God, and in afterwards adding promises and threatenings. Many promises, no doubt, relating to the free mercy of God and to Christ, are to be found in his writings; and these promises belong to faith. But this must be viewed as accidental, and altogether foreign to the inquiry, so far as a comparison is made between the law and 		the doctrine of grace. Let it be remembered, that the amount of the question is this: When a promise had been made, why did Moses afterwards add that new condition, &#8220;If a man do, he shall live in them;&#8221; and, &#8220;Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them?&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.v-p12.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005">Le 18:5</a><a name="iii.v.v-p12.2"></A>; <a name="iii.v.v-p12.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#026">De 27:26</a><a name="iii.v.v-p12.3"></A>.) Was 		it to produce something better and more perfect?</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.v-p13"></A>19. <i>Because of transgressions</i>. The law has manifold uses, but Paul confines himself to that which bears on his present subject. He did not propose to inquire in how many ways the law is of advantage to men. It is necessary to put readers on their guard on this point; for very many, I find, have fallen into the mistake of acknowledging no other advantage belonging to the 		law, but what is expressed in this passage. Paul himself elsewhere speaks of the precepts of the law as profitable for doctrine and exhortations. (<a name="iii.v.v-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016">2Ti 3:16</a><a name="iii.v.v-p13.1"></A>.) The definition here given of the use of the law is not complete, and those who refuse to make any other acknowledgment in favor of the law do wrong. Now, what is the import of the phrase, <i>because 		of transgressions</i>? It agrees with the saying of philosophers, that &#8220;The law was made for restraining evil-doers,&#8221; and with the old proverb, &#8220;From bad manners have sprung good laws.&#8221; But Paul&#8217;s meaning is more extensive than the words may seem to convey. He means that the law was published in order to make known transgressions, and in this way to compel men to acknowledge their guilt. As men naturally are too ready to excuse themselves, so, until they are roused by the 		law, their consciences are asleep.</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.v.v-p14"></A>&#8220;Until the law,&#8221; says Paul, &#8220;sin was in the world:<br> 		but sin is not imputed where there is no law.&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.v-p14.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#013">Ro 5:13</a><a name="iii.v.v-p14.2"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.v-p15"></A>The law came and roused the sleepers, for this is the true preparation for Christ. &#8220;By the law is the knowledge of sin.&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.v-p15.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020">Ro 3:20</a><a name="iii.v.v-p15.1"></A>.) Why?</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.v.v-p16"></A>&#8220;That Sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.v-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013">Ro 7:13</a><a name="iii.v.v-p16.1"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.v-p17"></A>Thus, &#8220;the law was added because of transgressions,&#8221; in order to reveal their true character, or, as he tells the Romans, that it might make them to abound. (<a name="iii.v.v-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020">Ro 5:20</a><a name="iii.v.v-p17.1"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.v-p18"></A>This passage has tortured the ingenuity of Origen, but to no purpose. If God summon consciences to his tribunal, that those qualities in their transgression, which would otherwise give them pleasure, may humble them by a conviction of guilt, &#8212; if he shake off the listlessness which overwhelmed all dread of his judgment-seat, &#8212; if he drag to light; sin, which lurked like a thief in the den of hypocrisy, &#8212; what is there in all this that can 		be reckoned absurd? But it may be objected: &#8220;As the law is the rule of a devout and holy life, why is it said to be added &#8216;because of transgressions,&#8217; rather than &#8216;because of obedience?&#8217;&#8221; I answer, however much it may point out true righteousness, yet, owing to the corruption of our nature, its instruction tends only to increase transgressions, until the Spirit of regeneration come, who writes it on the heart; and that Spirit is not given by the law, but is received by faith. This saying of 		Paul, let the reader remember, is not of a philosophical or political character, but expresses a purpose of the law, with which the world had been always unacquainted.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.v-p19"></A><i>Till the seed should come</i>. If it has respect <i>to seed</i>, it must be to that on which the blessing has been pronounced, and therefore it does not interfere with the promise. The word till, (&#7940;&#967;&#961;&#953;&#962; &#959;&#8023;,) signifies <i>so long as</i> the seed is expected: and hence 		it follows, that it must have been intended to occupy not the highest, but a subordinate rank. It was given in order to rouse men to the expectation of Christ. But was it necessary that it should last only until the coming of Christ? For if so, it follows that it is now abolished. The whole of that administration, I reply, was temporal, and was given for the purpose of preserving among the ancient people an attachment to the faith of Christ. And yet I do not admit that, by the coming of Christ, 		the whole law was abolished. The apostle did not intend this, but merely that the mode of administration, which for a time had been introduced, must receive its accomplishment in Christ, who is the fulfillment of the promise.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_59"><FONT SIZE="1">60</FONT></A>
 		 But on this subject we shall have occasion to speak more fully afterwards.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.v-p21"></A><i>Ordained by angels</i>. The circumstance, that it was delivered through angels, tends to the commendation of the law. This is declared by Stephen (<a name="iii.v.v-p21.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053">Ac 7:53</a><a name="iii.v.v-p21.1"></A>) also, who says, that they had &#8220;received the law, (&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#947;&#8048;&#962; &#7936;&#947;&#947;&#8051;&#955;&#969;&#957;,) into the 		dispositions of angels.&#8221; The interpretation given by some, that Moses and Aaron, and the priests, are the angels here meant, is more ingenious than solid. Nor is it wonderful that angels, by whom God bestows on us some of the smallest of his blessings, should have been intrusted also with this office of attending as witnesses at the promulgation of the law.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.v-p22"></A><i>In the hand of a Mediator</i> <i>Hand</i> usually signifies ministration; but as angels were ministers in giving the law, I consider &#8220;the hand of the Mediator&#8221; to denote the highest rank of service. The Mediator was at the head of the embassy, and angels were united with him as his companions. Some apply this expression to Moses, as 		marking a comparison between Moses and Christ; but I agree rather with the ancient expositors, who apply it to Christ himself.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A>
 		 This view, it will be found, agrees better with the context, though I differ from the ancients likewise as to the meaning of the word. <i>Mediator</i> does not, as they imagine, signify here one who makes reconciliation, which it does in these words,</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.v.v-p24"></A>&#8220;There is one Mediator between God and men,<br> 		the man Christ Jesus,&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.v-p24.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005">1Ti 2:5</a><a name="iii.v.v-p24.2"></A>,)</p>

<p><a name="iii.v.v-p28"></A><b>20.</b> <i>Now, a mediator is not a mediator of one.</i> Some are disposed to philosophize on this expression, and would make Paul&#8217;s meaning to be, that the twofold nature of Christ is not one in essence. But that Paul is here speaking of the contracting parties, no man of sound judgment entertains a doubt. And so they commonly 		expound it, that there is no room for a Mediator, unless when one of the parties has a matter to transact with the other. But why that statement should have been introduced they leave undetermined, though the passage manifestly deserves the most careful attention. There may, perhaps, be an Anticipation (&#960;&#961;&#8057;&#955;&#951;&#968;&#953;&#962;) of some wicked thought that might arise about a change of the divine purpose. Some one might say, &#8220;As men, when they change their mind 		about their covenants, are wont to retract them, so has it happened with the covenants of God.&#8221; If you take this to be the meaning, then, in the former clause, Paul would acknowledge that men, who occupy one side of this contract, are unsteady and changeable, while God nevertheless remains the same, is consistent with himself, and partakes not of the unsteadiness of men.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.v-p29"></A>But when I take a closer view of the whole subject, I rather think that it marks a difference between Jews and Gentiles. Christ is not the Mediator of one, because, in respect of outward character, there is a diversity of condition among those with whom, through his mediation, God enters into covenant. But Paul asserts that we have no right to judge in this manner of the covenant of God, as if it contradicted itself, or 		varied according to the diversities of men. The words are now clear. As Christ formerly reconciled God to the Jews in making a covenant, so now he is the Mediator of the Gentiles. The Jews differ widely from the Gentiles; for circumcision and ceremonies have erected &#8220;the middle wall of partition between them.&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.v-p29.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014">Eph 2:14</a><a name="iii.v.v-p29.1"></A>.)

This becomes evident, when Christ brings those who formerly differed among themselves to one God, and makes them unite in one body. <i>God is one</i>, because he always continues to be like himself, and, with unvarying regularity, holds fixed and unalterable the 		purpose which he has once made.  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_61"></A><A HREF="#fn_61"><FONT SIZE="1">62</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iii.v.v-p32"></A><b>21.</b> <i>Is the law then against the promises of God?</i> The certainty and steadiness of the divine purpose being admitted, we are bound equally to conclude that its results are not contrary to each other. Still there was a difficulty to be resolved, arising from the apparent contradiction between the Law and the covenant of grace. This is, perhaps, an 		exclamation. Dreading no farther contradiction, now that the point is settled, Paul concludes, that the former arguments have placed it beyond a doubt, and exclaims: &#8220;Who will now dare to imagine a disagreement between the law and the promises?&#8221; And yet this does not prevent Paul from proceeding to remove the difficulties that might still arise.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.v-p33"></A>Before answering the question, he expresses, in his usual manner, a high disdain of such folly; thus intimating the strong abhorrence with which pious men must regard whatever brings reproach on the Divine character. But another instance of high address, which claims our notice, is found in this turn of expression. He charges his adversaries with the offense of making God contradict himself. For from him the Law and the promises have 		evidently proceeded: whoever then alleges any contradiction between them blasphemes against God: but they do contradict each other, if the Law justifies. Thus does Paul most dexterously retort upon his adversaries the charge which they falsely and calumniously brought against him.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.v-p34"></A><i>For if there had been a law given</i>. The reply is (what is called) indirect, and does not plainly assert an agreement between the law and the promises, but contains all that is necessary to remove the contradiction. At first sight, you would say that this sentence departs from the context, and has nothing to do with the solution of the question; but this is not the case. The law would be opposed to 		the promises, if it had the power of justifying; for there would be two opposite methods of justifying a man, two separate roads towards the attainment of righteousness. But Paul refuses to the law such a power; so that the contradiction is removed. I would admit, says he, that righteousness is obtained by the law, if salvation were found in it. But what?</p>

It &#8220;hath concluded all under sin,&#8221; and therefore, instead of giving, it takes away righteousness from all. The reasoning is most powerful. &#8220;You seek righteousness in the law: but the law itself, with the whole of Scripture, leaves nothing to men but 		condemnation; for all men, with their works, are pronounced to be unrighteous: who then shall live by the law?&#8221; He alludes to these words,</p>

It tells us that, wherever we hear ourselves condemned in Scripture, 		there is help provided for us in Christ, if we betake ourselves to him. We are lost, though God were silent: why then does he so often pronounce that we are lost?

<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p18"></A><b>23.</b> <i>Before faith came</i>. The question proposed is now more fully defined. He explains at great length the use of the law, and the reason why it was temporal; for otherwise it would have appeared to be always unreasonable that a law should be delivered to the Jews, from which the Gentiles were excluded. If there be but one church consisting of Jews 		and Gentiles, why is there a diversity in its government? Whence is this new liberty derived, and on what authority does it rest, since the fathers were under subjection to the law? He therefore informs us, that the distinction is such as not to interrupt the union and harmony of the church.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p19"></A>We must again remind the reader that Paul does not treat exclusively of ceremonies, or of the moral law, but embraces the whole economy by which the Lord governed his people under the Old Testament. It became a subject of dispute whether the form of government instituted by Moses had any influence in obtaining righteousness. Paul compares this law first to a <i>prison</i>, and 		next to a <i>schoolmaster</i>. Such was the nature of the law, as both comparisons plainly show, that it could not have been in force beyond a certain time.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p20"></A><i>Faith</i> denotes the full revelation of those things which, during the darkness of the shadows of the law, were dimly seen; for he does not intend to say that the fathers, who lived under the law, did not possess faith. The faith of Abraham has already come under our notice, and other instances are quoted by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. (<a name="iii.v.vi-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#000">Heb 11</a><a name="iii.v.vi-p20.1"></A>.) The doctrine of faith, in short, is attested by Moses and all the prophets: but, as faith was not then clearly manifested, so the <i>time of faith</i> is an appellation here given, not in an absolute, but in a comparative sense, to the time of the New Testament. That this was his meaning is evident from what he immediately adds, that they were <i>shut up under the faith which should afterwards be revealed;</i> for this implies that those who were under the custody of the law were partakers of the same faith. The law did not restrain them from faith; but, that they might not wander from the fold of faith, it kept possession of themselves. There is an elegant allusion, too, to what he had formerly said, that &#8220;the scripture hath concluded all under sin.&#8221; They were besieged on every 		hand by the curse, but this siege was counteracted by an imprisonment which protected them from the curse; so that the imprisonment by the law is here proved to have been highly generous in its character.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p21"></A>Faith was not yet<i> revealed</i>, not because the fathers wanted light, but because they had less light than we have. The ceremonies might be said to shadow out an absent Christ, but to us he is represented as actually present, and thus while they had the mirror, we have the substance. Whatever might be the amount of darkness under the law, the fathers were not ignorant of the 		road in which they ought to walk. Though the dawn is not equal to the splendor of noon, yet, as it is sufficient to direct a journey, travelers do not wait till the sun is fully risen. Their portion of light resembled the dawn, which was enough to preserve them from all error, and guide them to everlasting blessedness.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.v.vi-p22"></A><a name="iii.v.vi-p22.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p23"></A><b>24.</b> <i>Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster</i> This is the second comparison, which still more clearly expresses Paul&#8217;s design. A schoolmaster is not appointed for the whole life, but only for childhood, as the etymology of the Greek word &#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#8057;&#962; implies.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">63</FONT></A>
 		 Besides, in training a child, the object is to prepare him, by the instructions of childhood, for maturer years. The comparison applies in both respects to the law, for its authority was limited to a particular age, and its whole object was to prepare its scholars in such a manner, that, when its elementary instructions were closed, they might make progress worthy of manhood. And so he adds, that it was our schoolmaster (&#949;&#7984;&#962; 		&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#957;) <i>unto Christ</i>. The grammarian, when he has trained a boy, delivers him into the hands of another, who conducts him through the higher branches of a finished education. In like manner, the law was the grammar of theology, which, after carrying its scholars a short way, handed them over to <i>faith</i> to be completed. Thus, Paul compares the Jews to children, and us to 		advanced youth.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p25"></A>But a question arises, what was the instruction or education of this schoolmaster? First, the law, by displaying the justice of God, convinced them that in themselves they were unrighteous; for in the commandments of God, as in a mirror, they might see how far they were distant from true righteousness. They were thus reminded that righteousness must be sought in some other quarter. The promises of the law served the same purpose, and 		might lead to such reflections as these: &#8220;If you cannot obtain life by works but by fulfilling the law, some new and different method must be sought. Your weakness will never allow you to ascend so high; nay, though you desire and strive ever so much, you will fall far short of the object.&#8221; The threatenings, on the other hand, pressed and entreated them to seek refuge from the wrath and curse of God, and gave them no rest till they were constrained to seek the grace of Christ.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p26"></A>Such too, was the tendency of all the ceremonies; for what end did sacrifices and washings serve but to keep the mind continually fixed on pollution and condemnation? When a man&#8217;s uncleanness is placed before his eyes, when the unoffending animal is held forth as the image of his own death, how can he indulge in sleep? How can he but be roused to the earnest cry for deliverance? Beyond all doubt, ceremonies accomplished their object, not 		merely by alarming and humbling the conscience, but by exciting them to the faith of the coming Redeemer. In the imposing services of the Mosaic ritual, every thing that was presented to the eye bore an impress of Christ. The law, in short, was nothing else than an immense variety of exercises, in which the worshippers were led by the hand to Christ.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p27"></A><i>That we might be justified by faith</i>. He has already said that the law is not perfect, when he compared it to the training of childhood; but it would make men perfect if it bestowed upon them righteousness. What remains but that faith shall take its place? And so it does, when we, who are destitute of a righteousness of our own, are clothed by it with the righteousness of Christ. Thus is the 		saying accomplished, &#8220;he hath filled the hungry with good things.&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.vi-p27.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#053">Lu 1:53</a><a name="iii.v.vi-p27.1"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.v.vi-p28"></A><a name="iii.v.vi-p28.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p29"></A><b>25.</b> <i>But after that faith is come</i>. This phrase has been already considered. It denotes the brighter revelation of grace after that &#8220;the vail of the temple was rent in twain,&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.vi-p29.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051">Mt 27:51</a><a name="iii.v.vi-p29.1"></A>,) which, we know, was effected by the 		manifestation of Christ. He affirms that, under the reign of Christ, there is no longer any childhood which needs to be placed under a schoolmaster, and that, consequently, the law has resigned its office, &#8212; which is another application of the comparison. There were two things which he had undertaken to prove, &#8212; that the law is a preparation for Christ, and that it is temporal. But here the question is again put, Is the law so abolished that we have nothing to do with it? I answer, the law, so 		far as it is a rule of life, a bridle to keep us in the fear of the Lord, a spur to correct the sluggishness of our flesh, &#8212; so far, in short, as it is</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p30"></A>&#8220;profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that believers may be instructed in every good work,&#8221; (<a name="iii.v.vi-p30.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016">2 Tim. 3:16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017">17</a><a name="iii.v.vi-p30.1"></A>,)</p>

<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p32"></A>In what respect, then, is it abolished? Paul, we have said, looks at the law as possessing certain qualities, and those qualities we shall enumerate. It annexes to works a reward and a punishment; that is, it promises life to those who keep it, and curses all transgressors. Meanwhile, it requires from man the highest perfection and most exact obedience. It makes no abatement, gives no pardon, but calls to a severe reckoning the smallest 		offenses. It does not openly exhibit Christ and his grace, but points him out at a distance, and only when hidden by the covering of ceremonies. All such qualities of the law, Paul tells us, are abolished; so that the office of Moses is now at an end, so far as it differs in outward aspect from a covenant of grace.</p>

<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p34"></A><b>26.</b> <i>For ye are all the children of God</i>. It would be unjust, and in the highest degree unreasonable, that the law should hold believers in perpetual slavery. This is proved by the additional argument, that they are the children of God. It would not be enough to say that we are no longer children, unless it were added that we are freemen; for in 		slaves age makes no alteration. The fact of their being the children of God proves their freedom. How? <i>By faith in Christ Jesus;</i> for</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.v.vi-p35"></A>&#8220;as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.&#8221;<br> 		(<a name="iii.v.vi-p35.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012">Joh 1:12</a><a name="iii.v.vi-p35.2"></A>.)</p>

<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p38"></A><b>27.</b> <i>As many of you as have been baptized</i>. The greater and loftier the privilege is of being the children of God, the farther is it removed from our senses, and the more difficult to obtain belief. He therefore explains, in a few words, what is implied in our being united, or rather, made one with the Son of God; so as to remove all doubt, that 		what belongs to him is communicated to us. He employs the metaphor of a garment, when he says that the Galatians <i>have put on Christ</i>; but he means that they are so closely united to him, that, in the presence of God, they bear the name and character of Christ, and are viewed in him rather than in themselves. This metaphor or similitude, taken from garments, occurs frequently, and has been treated by us in other places.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p39"></A>But the argument, that, because they have been baptized, they have put on Christ, appears weak; for how far is baptism from being efficacious in all? Is it reasonable that the grace of the Holy Spirit should be so closely linked to an external symbol? Does not the uniform doctrine of Scripture, as well as experience, appear to confute this statement? I answer, it is customary with Paul to treat of the 		sacraments in two points of view. When he is dealing with hypocrites, in whom the mere symbol awakens pride, he then proclaims loudly the emptiness and worthlessness of the outward symbol, and denounces, in strong terms, their foolish confidence. In such cases he contemplates not the ordinance of God, but the corruption of wicked men. When, on the other hand, he addresses believers, who make a proper use of the symbols, he then views them in connection with the truth &#8212; which they represent. In 		this case, he makes no boast of any false splendor as belonging to the sacraments, but calls our attention to the actual fact represented by the outward ceremony. Thus, agreeably to the Divine appointment, the truth comes to be associated with the symbols.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p40"></A>But perhaps some person will ask, Is it then possible that, through the fault of men, a sacrament shall cease to bear a figurative meaning? The reply is easy. Though wicked men may derive no advantage from the sacraments, they still retain undiminished their nature and force. The sacraments present, both to good and to bad men, the grace of God. No falsehood attaches to the promises which they exhibit of the grace of the Holy Spirit. 		Believers receive what is offered; and if wicked men, by rejecting it, render the offer unprofitable to themselves, their conduct cannot destroy the faithfulness of God, or the true meaning of the sacrament.  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A>
 		With strict propriety, then, does Paul, in addressing believers, say, that when they were baptized, they &#8220;put on Christ;&#8221; just as, in the Epistle to the Romans, he says,</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.v.vi-p42"></A>&#8220;that we have been planted together into his death,<br> 		so as to be also partakers of his resurrection.&#8221;<br> 		(<a name="iii.v.vi-p42.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#005">Ro 6:5</a><a name="iii.v.vi-p42.3"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p43"></A>In this way, the symbol and the Divine operation are kept distinct, and yet the meaning of the sacraments is manifest; so that they cannot be regarded as empty and trivial exhibitions; and we are reminded with what base ingratitude they are chargeable, who, by abusing the precious ordinances of God, not only render them unprofitable to themselves, but turn them to their own destruction!</p>

<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p45"></A><b>28.</b> <i>There is neither Jew nor Greek</i>. The meaning is, that there is no distinction of persons here, and therefore it is of no consequence to what nation or condition any one may belong: nor is circumcision any more regarded than sex or civil rank. And why? Because Christ makes them all one. Whatever may have been their former differences, Christ 		alone is able to unite them all. <i>Ye are one:</i> the distinction is now removed. The apostle&#8217;s object is to shew that the grace of adoption, and the hope of salvation, do not depend on the law, but are contained in Christ alone, who therefore is all. Greek is here put, as usual, for Gentile, and one department for the whole class.</p>

<p><a name="iii.v.vi-p47"></A><b>29.</b> <i>Then are ye Abraham&#8217;s seed</i>. This is not intended to convey the idea, that to be a child of Abraham is better than to be a member of Christ, &#8212; but to repress the pride of the Jews, who gloried in their privilege, as if they alone were the people of God. They reckoned no distinction higher than to belong to the race of Abraham; and this very 		distinction he makes to be common to all who believe in Christ. The conclusion rests on this argument, that Christ is the blessed seed, in whom, as we have said, all the children of Abraham are united. He proves this by the universal offer of the inheritance to them all, from which it follows, that the promise includes them among the children. It deserves notice, that, wherever faith is mentioned, it is always his relation to the promise.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.v.v-p23"></A> &#8220;Though some learned men have been of opinion that the mediator here mentioned is the Son of God, yet I think no reasonable doubt can be entertained as to its denoting Moses. Strictly speaking, Aaron, or rather the priesthood, was the mediator of the old covenant. It answers to the Great High-Priest, (<a name="iii.v.v-p23.1"></A>&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#953;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#8059;&#962;,) Mediator, 			 (<a name="iii.v.v-p23.2"></A>&#956;&#949;&#963;&#8055;&#964;&#951;&#962;,) and Surety, (<a name="iii.v.v-p23.3"></A>&#7956;&#947;&#947;&#965;&#959;&#962;,) of the new covenant. But the reference seems here to the <i>giving</i> of the law: that was by Moses. &#8216;The law was given by Moses.&#8217; (<a name="iii.v.v-p23.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017">Joh 1:17</a><a name="iii.v.v-p23.4"></A>.) God speaks to Moses, and Moses speaks to the people; and this arrangement was entered into by the express request of the people themselves.

Schott remarks, that the bare 			 fact of upwards of 250 interpretations makes it impossible to deny that some obscurity attaches to the Apostle&#8217;s language in this passage, arising chiefly from mere brevity of style, but judiciously adds, that, had there not been many commentators more eager to bring forward anything that has the appearance of novelty, than to investigate the ordinary meaning of the terms, the scope of the passage, and the doctrinal statements and reasonings contained in the writings of the Apostle Paul, the 			 interpretations would never have swelled to so large an amount. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</p> 		</P>
