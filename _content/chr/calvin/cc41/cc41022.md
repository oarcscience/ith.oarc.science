<span id="v.iii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 3

<span id="v.iii-p3"></span>**1** O foolish Galatians, who hath enchanted
you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes hath been clearly exhibited
Jesus, Christ crucified among you?

<span id="v.iii-p4"></span>**2** This only I wish to learn from you;
Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the preaching of
faith?

<span id="v.iii-p5"></span>**3** Are ye so foolish, that, having begun
by the Spirit, ye are now completed by the flesh?

<span id="v.iii-p6"></span>**4** Have ye suffered so many things in
vain? if it be indeed in vain.

<span id="v.iii-p7"></span>**5** He therefore that ministereth to you
the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, (doth he it) by the works of
the law, or by the preaching of faith?

<span id="v.iii-p8"></span>**6** Even as Abraham believed God, and it
was imputed to him for righteousness. (<span id="v.iii-p8.1"></span>[Ge
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006)<span id="v.iii-p8.1"></span>
<span id="v.iii-p8.2"></span>[Ro
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003)<span id="v.iii-p8.2"></span> <span
id="v.iii-p8.3"></span>[Jas 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#023)<span
id="v.iii-p8.3"></span>.)

<span id="v.iii-p9"></span>**7** Know ye therefore that they who are of
faith are the children of Abraham.

<span id="v.iii-p10"></span>**8** And the scripture, because it foresaw
 <span id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181) that God would justify the
Gentiles by faith, formerly preached the gospel to Abraham: In thee
shall all nations be blessed.

<span id="v.iii-p12"></span>**9** And so they who are of faith are
blessed with believing Abraham.

<span id="v.iii-p13"></span>**10** For all that are of the works of the
law are under a curse; for it is written, (<span
id="v.iii-p13.1"></span>[De 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#006)<span
id="v.iii-p13.1"></span>,) Cursed is every one that continueth not in
all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.

<span id="v.iii-p14"></span>**11** Now that by the law no man is
instilled before God is evident, for the just by faith shall live.
(<span id="v.iii-p14.1"></span>[Hab
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004)<span id="v.iii-p14.1"></span>;
<span id="v.iii-p14.2"></span>[Ro
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017)<span id="v.iii-p14.2"></span>;
<span id="v.iii-p14.3"></span>[Heb
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038)<span id="v.iii-p14.3"></span>.)

<span id="v.iii-p15"></span>**12** And the law is not of faith; but the
man who shall do these things shall live in them. (<span
id="v.iii-p15.1"></span>[Le 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005)<span
id="v.iii-p15.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.iii-p16"></span>**13** Christ hath redeemed us from the
curse of the law, having been made a curse for us; (for it is written,
(<span id="v.iii-p16.1"></span>[De
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023)<span id="v.iii-p16.1"></span>,)
Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree;)

<span id="v.iii-p17"></span>**14** That the blessing of Abraham may come
upon the Gentiles by Christ Jesus; that we may receive the promise of
the Spirit by faith.

<span id="v.iii-p18"></span>**15** Brethren, (I speak after the manner
of men,) though it be but a man’s covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no
man setteth aside or addeth any thing.

<span id="v.iii-p19"></span>**16** Now to Abraham were the promises
spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many, but as
of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.

<span id="v.iii-p20"></span>**17** And this I say: the covenant (which
was) formerly confirmed by God concerning Christ, the law, which began
four hundred and thirty years after, doth not annul, so as to abolish
the promise.

<span id="v.iii-p21"></span>**18** For, if the inheritance (is) by the
law, (it is) no longer by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by
promise.

<span id="v.iii-p22"></span>**19** To what then serveth the law?  <span
id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182) It was added because of
transgressions, till the seed should come, to whom the promise was made;
(and it was) ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.

<span id="v.iii-p24"></span>**20** Now the mediator is not of one; but
God is one.

<span id="v.iii-p25"></span>**21** (Is) the law then against the
promises of God?  <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183) By no means;
for, if the law had been given that it might be able to give life,
 <span id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184) certainly righteousness would
have been by the law.

<span id="v.iii-p28"></span>**22** But the scripture hath shut up all
things under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be
given to them that believe.

<span id="v.iii-p29"></span>**23** Now before faith came, we were
guarded under the law, shut up to the faith which was to be revealed.

<span id="v.iii-p30"></span>**24** Wherefore the law was our
schoolmaster unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

<span id="v.iii-p31"></span>**25** But faith being come,  <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185) we are no longer under a schoolmaster.

<span id="v.iii-p33"></span>**26** For ye are all the children of God by
faith in Christ Jesus.

<span id="v.iii-p34"></span>**27** For as many of you as have been
baptized into Christ have put on Christ.

<span id="v.iii-p35"></span>**28** There is neither Jew nor Greek, there
is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are
all one in Christ Jesus.

<span id="v.iii-p36"></span>**29** And if ye are Christ’s, then are ye
Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.
