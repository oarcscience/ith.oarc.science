<p><a name="vi.iii-p3"></A><b>1 </b>For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, discharge the office of ambassador for you Gentiles;</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>If ye have heard of dispensation of the grace of God, (which was) given me towards you;</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>That through revelation he made known to me the secret, as I wrote a little before;</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>By attending to which ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets through the Spirit,</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>That the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ through the gospel.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, which was given to me according to the efficacy of his power.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>To me, the least of all saints, was this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>And that I should make manifest to all, what is the fellowship of the mystery, which hath been hid from ages in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ;</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>That the manifold wisdom of God might now be manifested to principalities and powers in heavenly places through the church,</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord,</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Through whom we have boldness, and access with confidence, through the faith of him.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my afflictions for you, which is your glory.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p16"></A><b>14 </b>For this cause I bend my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p17"></A><b>15 </b>Of whom the whole family in heaven and on earth is named,</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p18"></A><b>16 </b>That he would give to you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might through his Spirit in the inner man,</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p19"></A><b>17 </b>That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, that ye may be rooted and grounded in love,   	 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">218</FONT></A>
 	</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p21"></A><b>18 </b>That ye may be able to comprehend with all saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p22"></A><b>19 </b>To know, I say, the love of Christ, which surpasseth knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fullness of God.</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p23"></A><b>20 </b>Now to him who is able to do abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power working in you,</p>    
<p><a name="vi.iii-p24"></A><b>21 </b>Be glory in the church through Jesus Christ, in all ages, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
