<span id="v.ii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="v.ii-p3"></span>**1** Next, after fourteen years, I went up
again to Jerusalem along with Barnabas, having taken Titus also.

<span id="v.ii-p4"></span>**2** And I went up according to revelation,
 <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179) and communicated to them the
gospel which I preach among the Gentiles; but privately to them who were
of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.

<span id="v.ii-p6"></span>**3** But not even Titus, who was with me,
being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised;

<span id="v.ii-p7"></span>**4** On account of false brethren, who had
secretly entered in order to spy out our liberty, which we have in
Christ Jesus, that they might; bring us into bondage;

<span id="v.ii-p8"></span>**5** To whom we gave place by subjection, not
even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.

<span id="v.ii-p9"></span>**6** But of those who appeared to be
something, whatsoever they formerly were, it is of no consequence to me;
(God accepteth no man’s person, <span id="v.ii-p9.1"></span>[De
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#017)<span id="v.ii-p9.1"></span>;
<span id="v.ii-p9.2"></span>[2Ch
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#007)<span id="v.ii-p9.2"></span>;
<span id="v.ii-p9.3"></span>[Job
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#019)<span id="v.ii-p9.3"></span>;
<span id="v.ii-p9.4"></span>[Wisdom
6:8](../../../bib/apo/wis006.htm#008)<span id="v.ii-p9.4"></span>; <span
id="v.ii-p9.5"></span>[Ecclesiasticus
35:16](../../../bib/apo/sir035.htm#016)<span id="v.ii-p9.5"></span>;
<span id="v.ii-p9.6"></span>[Ac
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034)<span id="v.ii-p9.6"></span>;
<span id="v.ii-p9.7"></span>[Ro
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#011)<span id="v.ii-p9.7"></span>;
<span id="v.ii-p9.8"></span>[Eph
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009)<span id="v.ii-p9.8"></span>; <span

for they who appeared to be in estimation communicated nothing to me;

<span id="v.ii-p10"></span>**7** But, on the contrary, when they saw
that the gospel of the uncircumcision was communicated to me, as that of
the circumcision (was) to Peter;

<span id="v.ii-p11"></span>**8** (For he who was effectual in Peter in
order to the apostleship of circumcision, was also effectual in me
towards the Gentiles;)

<span id="v.ii-p12"></span>**9** And James, and Cephas, and John, (who
seethed to be pillars,) having known the grace given to me, gave to me
and to Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we might discharge
the apostleship among the Gentiles, and they among the circumcision.

<span id="v.ii-p13"></span>**10** Only that we should be mindful of the
poor, which I also was careful to do.

<span id="v.ii-p14"></span>**11** And when Peter was come to Antioch, I
openly withstood him, because he was worthy of blame.

<span id="v.ii-p15"></span>**12** For before that certain persons came
from James, he partook of food along with the Gentiles; but when they
were come, he withdrew and separated himself from them, dreading those
who were of the circumcision.

<span id="v.ii-p16"></span>**13** And the other Jews also dissembled
along with him, so that Barnabas also was led aside into their
dissimulation.

<span id="v.ii-p17"></span>**14** But when I saw that they did not walk
uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before
them all ‘If thou, being a Jew, livest like Gentiles, and not like Jews,
why compellest thou the Gentiles to live like Jews?

<span id="v.ii-p18"></span>**15** We, (who are) Jews by nature, and not
sinners of the Gentiles,

<span id="v.ii-p19"></span>**16** Knowing that man is not justified by
works of the law, but through the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have
believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of
Christ, and not by the works of the that; for by works of the law no
flesh shall be justified.

<span id="v.ii-p20"></span>**17** But if, seeking to be justified in
Christ, We ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ therefore the
minister of sin? By no means.

<span id="v.ii-p21"></span>**18** For if I build again those things
which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.

<span id="v.ii-p22"></span>**19** For by the law I am dead to the law.
That I might live to God,

<span id="v.ii-p23"></span>**20** I am crucified with Christ.  <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180) Now it is no longer I that live, but
Christ liveth in me; and that I now live in the flesh, I live by the
faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.

<span id="v.ii-p25"></span>**21** I do not set aside the grace of God;
for, if righteousness is by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.
