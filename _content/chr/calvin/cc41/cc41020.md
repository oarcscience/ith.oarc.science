<span id="v.i-p1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p2"></span>CHAPTER 1

<span id="v.i-p3"></span>**1** Paul, an apostle, not from men, neither
by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the
dead,

<span id="v.i-p4"></span>**2** And all the brethren who are with met to
the churches of Galatia;

<span id="v.i-p5"></span>**3** Grace (be) to you, and peace from God the
Father, and (from) our Lord Jesus Christ,

<span id="v.i-p6"></span>**4** Who gave himself for our sins, that he
might deliver us from the present wicked age, according to the will of
God and our Father,

<span id="v.i-p7"></span>**5** To whom (be) glory for ever and ever.
Amen.

<span id="v.i-p8"></span>**6** I wonder that ye are so soon removed from
Christ who called you in grace,  <span id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171)
to another gospel;

<span id="v.i-p10"></span>**7** Which is not another thing, than that
there are some who trouble you, and wish to subvert the gospel of
Christ.

<span id="v.i-p11"></span>**8** But although we, or an angel from heaven
preach the gospel to you otherwise than what we have preached to you,
let him be accursed.

<span id="v.i-p12"></span>**9** As we said before, now also I say again,
if any one shall preach the gospel to you otherwise than what ye have
received, let him be accursed.

<span id="v.i-p13"></span>**10** For do I now persuade according to men,
or according to God?  <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172) or do I
seek to please men? for if I still pleased men, I should not be a
servant of Christ.

<span id="v.i-p15"></span>**11** But I make known to you, brethren,
concerning the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not according
to man;

<span id="v.i-p16"></span>**12** For I neither received nor learned it
from man, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

<span id="v.i-p17"></span>**13** For ye have heard of my conversation,
which formerly was in Judaism;  <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173)
that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it,

<span id="v.i-p19"></span>**14** And profited in Judaism  <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174) above many my equals  <span
id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175) in my nation, being exceedingly
zealous for the traditions of the fathers.  <span
id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176)

<span id="v.i-p23"></span>**15** But after that it pleased God, (who had
separated me from my mother’s womb, and (who) called me by his grace,)

<span id="v.i-p24"></span>**16** To reveal his son to me, that I might
preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I conferred not  <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177) with flesh and blood,

<span id="v.i-p26"></span>**17** Neither did I return to Jerusalem, to
those who were apostles before me; but I went away into Arabia, and
again returned to Damascus.

<span id="v.i-p27"></span>**18** Next after three years, I returned to
Jerusalem, that I might see Peter; and I abode with him fifteen days.

<span id="v.i-p28"></span>**19** But I saw none other of the apostles,
except James the Lord’s brother.

<span id="v.i-p29"></span>**20** Now the things which I write to you,
behold, before God, I do not speak falsely.

<span id="v.i-p30"></span>**21** Afterwards I came into the countries of
Syria and Cilicia;

<span id="v.i-p31"></span>**22** And was unknown by face to the churches
of Judea, which were in Christ.

<span id="v.i-p32"></span>**23** But there was only this report among
them:  <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178) He who at one time
persecuted us, now preacheth the faith which he formerly was destroying,

<span id="v.i-p34"></span>**24** And they glorified God in me.
