<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p14"></A><b>1.</b> <i>Paul, an apostle</i>. In the salutations with which he commenced his Epistles, Paul was accustomed to claim the title of &#8220;an Apostle.&#8221; His object in doing so, as we have remarked on former occasions, was to employ the authority of his station, for the purpose of enforcing his doctrine. This authority depends not on the judgment or opinion of men, 		but exclusively on the calling of God; and therefore he demands a hearing on the ground of his being &#8220;an Apostle.&#8221; Let us always bear this in mind, that in the church we ought to listen to God alone, and to Jesus Christ, whom he has appointed to be our teacher. Whoever assumes a right to instruct us, must speak in the name of God or of Christ.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p15"></A>But as the calling of Paul was more vehemently disputed among the Galatians, he asserts it more strongly in his address to that church, than in his other Epistles; for he does not simply affirm that he was called by God, but states expressly that it was <i>not either from men or by men</i>. This statement, be it observed, applies not to the office which he held in common with 		other pastors, but to the apostleship. The authors of the calumnies which he has in his eye did not venture to deprive him altogether of the honor of the Christian ministry. They merely refused to allow him the name and rank of an apostle.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p16"></A>We are now speaking of the apostleship in the strictest sense; for the word is employed in two different ways. Sometimes, it denotes preachers of the Gospel, to whatever class they might belong; but here it bears a distinct reference to the highest rank in the church; so that Paul is equal to Peter and to the other twelve.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p17"></A>The first clause, that he was called <i>not from men</i>, he had in common with all the true ministers of Christ. As no man ought to &#8220;take this honor unto himself,&#8221; (<a name="iii.iii.i-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#004">Heb 5:4</a><a name="iii.iii.i-p17.1"></A>,) so it is not in the power of men to bestow it on whomsoever they choose. It belongs to God alone to govern his church; and therefore the calling cannot be lawful, unless it 		proceed from Him. So far as the church is concerned, a man who has been led to the ministry, not by a good conscience, but by ungodly motives, may happen to be regularly called. But Paul is here speaking of a call ascertained in so perfect, a manner, that nothing farther can be desired.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p18"></A>It will, perhaps, be objected &#8212; Do not the false apostles frequently indulge in the same kind of boasting? I admit they do, and in a more haughty and disdainful style than the servants of the Lord venture to employ; but they want that actual call from Heaven to which Paul was entitled to lay claim.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p19"></A>The second clause, that he was called <i>not by man</i>, belonged in a peculiar manner to the apostles; for in an ordinary pastor, this would have implied nothing wrong. Paul himself, when travelling through various cities in company with Barnabas, &#8220;ordained elders in every church,&#8221; by the votes of the people, (<a name="iii.iii.i-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023">Ac 14:23</a><a name="iii.iii.i-p19.1"></A>;) and he enjoins Titus and 		Timothy to proceed in the same work. (<a name="iii.iii.i-p19.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017">1Ti 5:17</a><a name="iii.iii.i-p19.2"></A> <a name="iii.iii.i-p19.3"></A>Titus 1:5.) Such is the ordinary method of electing pastors; for we are not entitled to wait until God shall reveal from heaven the names of the persons whom he has chosen.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p20"></A>But if human agency was not improper, if it was even commendable, why does Paul disclaim it in reference to himself? I have already mentioned that something more was necessary to be proved than that Paul was a pastor, or that he belonged to the number of the ministers of the Gospel; for the point in dispute was the apostleship. It was necessary that the apostles should be elected, not in the same manner as other pastors, but by the 		direct agency of the Lord himself. Thus, Christ himself (<a name="iii.iii.i-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001">Mt 10:1</a><a name="iii.iii.i-p20.1"></A>) called the Twelve; and when a successor was to be appointed in the room of Judas, the church does not venture to choose one by votes, but has recourse to <i>lot</i>. (<a name="iii.iii.i-p20.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#026">Ac 1:26</a><a name="iii.iii.i-p20.2"></A>.) We are certain that the lot was not employed in electing pastors. Why was it 		resorted to in the election of Matthias? To mark the express agency of God for it was proper that the apostles should be distinguished from other ministers. And thus Paul, in order to shew that he does not belong to the ordinary rank of ministers, contends that his calling proceeded immediately from God.  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A>
</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p22"></A>But how does Paul affirm that he was <i>not</i> called <i>by men</i>, while Luke records that Paul and Barnabas were called by the church at Antioch? Some have replied, that he had previously discharged the duties of an apostle, and that, consequently, his apostleship was not founded on his appointment by that church. But here, again, it may be objected, that this was his first designation to be the apostle of the Gentiles, to which 		class the Galatians belonged. The more correct, and obvious reply is, that he did not intend here to set aside entirely the calling of that church, but merely to shew that his apostleship rests on a higher title. This is true; for even those who laid their hands on Paul at Antioch did so, not of their own accord, but in obedience to express revelation.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p23"></A>&#8220;As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.&#8221; (<a name="iii.iii.i-p23.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002">Acts 13:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#003">3</a><a name="iii.iii.i-p23.1"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p24"></A>Since, therefore, he was called by Divine revelation, and was also appointed and declared by the Holy Spirit to be the apostle of the Gentiles, it follows, that he was not brought forward <i>by men</i>, although the customary rite of ordination was afterwards added.  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A>
</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p26"></A>It will, perhaps, be thought that an indirect contrast between Paul and the false apostles is here intended. I have no objection to that view; for they were in the habit of glorying in the name of men. His meaning will therefore stand thus: &#8220;Whoever may be the persons by whom others boast that they have been sent, I shall be superior to them; for I hold my commission from God and Christ.&#8221;</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p27"></A><i>By Jesus Christ and God the Father</i> He asserts that God the Father and Christ had bestowed on him his apostleship. Christ is first named, because it is his prerogative to send, and because we are his ambassadors. But to make the statement more complete, the Father is also mentioned; as if he had said, &#8220;If there be any one whom the name of Christ is not sufficient to inspire with reverence, let 		him know that I have also received my office from God the Father.&#8221;</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p28"></A><i>Who raised him from the dead</i>. The resurrection of Christ is the commencement of his reign, and is therefore closely connected with the present subject. It was a reproach brought by them against Paul that he had held no communication with Christ, while he was on the earth. He argues, on the other hand, that, as Christ was glorified by his resurrection, so he has actually exercised his authority 		in the government of his church. The calling of Paul is therefore more illustrious than it would have been, if Christ, while still a mortal, had ordained him to the office. And this circumstance deserves attention; for Paul intimates that the attempt to set aside his authority, involved a malignant opposition to the astonishing power of God, which was displayed in the resurrection of Christ; because the same heavenly Father, who raised Christ from the dead, commanded Paul to make known that 		exertion of his power.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.i-p29"></A><a name="iii.iii.i-p29.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p30"></A><b>2.</b> <i>And all the brethren who are with me</i>. &#8212; He appears to have usually written in the name of many persons, judging that, if those to whom he wrote should attach less weight to a solitary individual, they might listen to a greater number, and would not despise a whole congregation. His general practice is, to insert the salutations from brethren 		at the conclusion, instead of introducing them at the commencement as joint authors of the epistle: at least, he never mentions more than two names, and those very well known. But here he includes all the brethren; and thus adopts, though not without good reason, an opposite method. The concurrence of so many godly persons must have had some degree of influence in softening the minds of the Galatians, and preparing them to receive instruction.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p31"></A><i>To the churches of Galatia</i>. It was an extensive country, and therefore contained many churches scattered through it. But is it not wonderful that the term &#8220;Church&#8221;, which always implies unity of faith, should have been applied to the Galatians, who had almost entirely revolted from Christ? I reply, so long as they professed Christianity, worshipped one God, observed the sacraments, and enjoyed 		some kind of Gospel ministry, they retained the external marks of a church. We do not always find in churches such a measure of purity as might be desired. The purest have their blemishes; and some are marked, not by a few spots, but by general deformity. Though the doctrines and practices of any society may not, in all respects, meet our wishes, we must not instantly pronounce its defects to be a sufficient reason for withholding from it the appellation of a Church. Paul manifests here a 		gentleness of disposition utterly at variance with such a course. Yet our acknowledgment of societies to be churches of Christ must be accompanied by an explicit condemnation of everything in them that is improper or defective; for we must not imagine, that, wherever there is some kind of church, everything in it that ought to be desired in a church is perfect.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p32"></A>I make this observation, because the Papists, seizing on the single word <i>Church</i>, think that whatever they choose to force upon us is sanctioned; though the condition and aspect of the Church of Rome are widely different from what existed in Galatia. If Paul were alive at the present day, he would perceive the miserable and dreadfully shattered remains of a church; but he would perceive no building. In short, the word Church is 		often applied by a figure of speech in which a part is taken for the whole, to any portion of the church, even though it may not fully answer to the name.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.i-p33"></A><a name="iii.iii.i-p33.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p34"></A><b>3.</b> <i>Grace be to you and peace</i>. This form of salutation, which occurred in the other epistles, has received an explanation, to which I still adhere. Paul wishes for the Galatians a state of friendship with God, and, along with it, all good things; for the favor of God is the source from which we derive every kind of prosperity. He presents both 		petitions to Christ, as well as to the Father; because without Christ neither grace, nor any real prosperity, can be obtained.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.i-p35"></A><a name="iii.iii.i-p35.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p36"></A><b>4.</b> <i>Who gave himself for our sins</i>. He begins with commending the grace of Christ, in order to recall and fix on Him the attention of the Galatians; for, if they had justly appreciated this benefit of redemption, they would never have fallen into opposite views of religion. He who knows Christ in a proper manner beholds him earnestly, embraces him 		with the warmest affection, is absorbed in the contemplation of him, and desires no other object. The best remedy for purifying our minds from any kind of errors or superstitions, is to keep in remembrance our relation to Christ, and the benefits which he has conferred upon us.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p37"></A>These words, <i>who gave himself for our sins</i>, were intended to convey to the Galatians a doctrine of vast importance; that no other satisfactions can lawfully be brought into comparison with that sacrifice of himself which Christ offered to the Father; that in Christ, therefore, and in him alone, atonement for sin, and perfect righteousness, must be sought; and that the 		manner in which we are redeemed by him ought to excite our highest admiration. What Paul here ascribes to Christ is, with equal propriety, ascribed in other parts of Scripture to God the Father; for, on the one hand, the Father, by an eternal purpose, decreed this atonement, and gave this proof of his love to us, that he &#8220;spared not his only-begotten Son, (<a name="iii.iii.i-p37.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032">Ro 8:32</a><a name="iii.iii.i-p37.1"></A>,) but delivered 		him up for us all;&#8221; and Christ, on the other hand, offered himself a sacrifice in order to reconcile us to God. Hence it follows, that his death is the satisfaction for sins.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A>
</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p39"></A><i>That he might deliver us</i>. He likewise declares the design of our redemption to be, that Christ, by his death, might purchase us to be his own property. This takes place when we are separated from the world; for so long as we are of the world, we do not belong to Christ. The word &#945;&#953;&#8061;&#957;, (<i>age</i>,) is 		here put for the corruption which is in the world; in the same manner as in the first Epistle of John, (<a name="iii.iii.i-p39.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019">1Jo 5:19</a><a name="iii.iii.i-p39.1"></A>) where it is said that &#8220;the whole world lieth in the wicked one,&#8221; and in his Gospel, (<a name="iii.iii.i-p39.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#015">Joh 17:15</a><a name="iii.iii.i-p39.2"></A>,) where the Savior says,</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iii.i-p40"></A>&#8220;I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world,<br> 		but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil;&#8221;</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p41"></A>for there it signifies the present life.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p42"></A>What then is meant by the word &#8220;World&#8221; in this passage? Men separated from the kingdom of God and the grace of Christ. So long as a man lives to himself, he is altogether condemned. The World is, therefore, contrasted with regeneration, as nature with grace, or the flesh with the spirit. Those who are born of the world have nothing but sin and wickedness, not by creation, but by corruption.  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A>
 		Christ, therefore, died for our sins, in order to redeem or separate us from the world.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p44"></A><i>From the present wicked age.</i> By adding the epithet &#8220;wicked&#8221;, he intended to shew that he is speaking of the corruption or depravity which proceeds from sin, and not of God&#8217;s creatures, or of the bodily life. And yet by this single word, as by a thunderbolt, he lays low all human pride; for he declares, that, apart from that renewal of the nature which is bestowed by the grace of Christ, there is 		nothing in us but unmixed wickedness. We are of the world; and, till Christ take us out of it, the world reigns in us, and we live to the world. Whatever delight men may take in their fancied excellence, they are worthless and depraved; not indeed in their own opinion, but in the judgment of our Lord, which is here pronounced by the mouth of Paul, and which ought to satisfy our minds.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p45"></A><i>According to the will</i>. He points out the original fountain of grace, namely, the purpose of God;</p>  	 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iii.i-p46"></A>&#8220;for God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son.&#8221; (<a name="iii.iii.i-p46.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016">Joh 3:16</a><a name="iii.iii.i-p46.1"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p47"></A>But it deserves notice, that Paul is accustomed to represent the decree of God as setting aside all compensation or merit on the part of men, and so <i>Will</i> denotes here what is commonly called &#8220;good pleasure.&#8221;   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A>
 		 The meaning is, that Christ suffered for us, not because we were worthy, or because anything done by us moved him to the act, but because such was the purpose of God. <i>Of God and our Father</i> is of the same import as if he had said, &#8220;Of God who is our Father.&#8221;   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii.i-p51"></A><b>5.</b> <i>To whom be glory</i>. By this sudden exclamation of thanksgiving, he intends to awaken powerfully in his readers the contemplation of that invaluable gift which they had received from God, and in this manner to prepare their minds more fully for receiving instruction. It must at the same time be viewed as a general exhortation. Every instance in 		which the mercy of God occurs to our remembrance, ought to be embraced by us as an occasion of ascribing glory to God.</p>  <a name="iii.iii.ii"></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p12"></A><b>6.</b> <i>I wonder. </i>He commences by administering a rebuke, though a somewhat milder one than they deserved; but his greatest severity of language is directed, as we shall see, against the false apostles. He charges them with turning aside, not only from his gospel, but from Christ; for it was impossible for them to retain their attachment to Christ, 		without acknowledging that he has graciously delivered us from the bondage of the law. But such a belief cannot be reconciled with those notions respecting the obligation of ceremonial observance which the false apostles inculcated. They were <i>removed from</i> Christ; not that they entirely rejected Christianity, but that the corruption of their doctrines was such as to leave them nothing more than an imaginary Christ.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p13"></A>Thus, in our own times, the Papists, choosing to have a divided and mangled Christ, have none, and are therefore &#8220;removed from Christ.&#8221; They are full of superstitions, which are directly at variance with the nature of Christ. Let it be carefully observed, that we are <i>removed from Christ</i>, when we fall into those views which are inconsistent with his mediatorial office; 		for light can have no fellowship with darkness.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p14"></A>On the same principle, he calls it <i>another gospel</i>, that is, a gospel different from the true one. And yet the false apostles professed that they preached the gospel of Christ; but, mingling with it their own inventions,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A>
 		 by which its principal efficacy was destroyed, they held a false, corrupt, and spurious gospel. By using the present tense, (&#8220;ye are removed&#8221;) he appears to say that they were only in the <i>act</i> of failing. As if he had said, &#8220;I do not yet say that ye have been removed; for then it would be more difficult to return to the right path.

When he says that they were called by Christ through grace, this tends to heighten the criminality of their ingratitude. To revolt from the Son of God under any circumstances, is unworthy and 		disgraceful; but to revolt from him, after being invited to partake salvation by grace, is more eminently base. His goodness to us renders our ingratitude to him more dreadfully heinous.</p>

As the consideration of 		the grace by which they had been called was adduced to aggravate their ingratitude, so the circumstance of the time when they were removed is now adduced to aggravate their levity.</p>

 		 Some explain it thus, &#8220;though there is not another gospel;&#8221; as if it were a sort of correction of the Apostle&#8217;s language, to guard against the supposition that there were more gospels than one. So far as the explanation of the words is concerned, I take a more simple view of them; for he speaks contemptuously of the doctrine of the false apostles, as being nothing else than a mass of confusion and destruction. As if he had said, &#8220;What do those persons allege? On 		what grounds do they attack the doctrine which I have delivered? They merely trouble you, and subvert the gospel. They do nothing more.&#8221; But it amounts to the same meaning; for this, too, I acknowledge, is a correction of the language he had used about <i>another gospel</i>. He declares that it is not a gospel, but a mere disturbance. All I intended to say was, that, in my opinion, the word <i>another</i> 		means <i>another thing</i>. It resembles strongly the expression in common use, &#8220;this amounts to <i>nothing, but that</i> you wish to deceive.&#8221;</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p21"></A><i>And wish to pervert.</i> He charges them with the additional crime of doing an injury to Christ, by endeavoring to subvert his gospel. Subversion is an enormous crime. It is worse than corruption. And with good reason does he fasten on them this charge. When the glow of justification is ascribed to another, and a snare is laid for the consciences of men, the Savior no longer occupies his place, and 		the doctrine of the gospel is utterly ruined.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p22"></A><i>The gospel of Christ</i>. To know what are the leading points of the gospel, is a matter of unceasing importance. When these are attacked, the gospel is destroyed. When he adds the words, <i>of Christ</i>, this may be explained in two ways; either that it has come from Christ as its author, or that it purely exhibits Christ. The apostle&#8217;s reason for 		employing that expression unquestionably was to describe the true and genuine gospel, which alone is worthy of the name.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.ii-p23"></A><a name="iii.iii.ii-p23.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p24"></A><b>8.</b> <i>But though we</i>. As he proceeds in defending the authority of his doctrine, his confidence swells. First of all, he declares that the doctrine which he had preached is the only gospel, and that the attempt to set it aside is highly criminal. But then he was aware, the false apostles might object: &#8220;We will not yield to 		you in our desire to maintain the gospel, or in those feelings of respect for it which we are accustomed to cherish.&#8221; Just as, at the present day, the Papists describe in the strongest terms the sacredness with which they regard the gospel, and kiss the very name with the deepest reverence, and yet, when brought to the trial, are found to persecute fiercely the pure and simple doctrine of the gospel. Accordingly, Paul does not rest satisfied with this general declaration, but proceeds to define 		what the gospel is, and what it contains, and declares boldly that his doctrine is the true gospel; so as to resist all further inquiry.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p25"></A>Of what avail was it to profess respect for the gospel, and not to know what it meant? With Papists, who hold themselves bound to render <i>implicit faith</i>, that might be perfectly sufficient; but with Christians, where there is no knowledge, there is no faith. That the Galatians, who were otherwise disposed to obey the gospel, might not wander hither and thither, and &#8220;find no rest for the sole of their foot,&#8221; (<a name="iii.iii.ii-p25.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#009">Ge 8:9</a><a name="iii.iii.ii-p25.1"></A>,) Paul enjoins them to stand steadfastly by his doctrine. He demands such unhesitating belief of his preaching, that he pronounces a curse on all who dared to contradict it.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p26"></A>And here it is not a little remarkable, that he begins with himself; for thus he anticipates a slander with which his enemies would have loaded him. &#8220;You wish to have everything which comes from you received without hesitation, because it is your own.&#8221; To show that there is no foundation for such a statement, he instantly surrenders the right of advancing anything against his own doctrine. He claims no superiority, in this respect, over 		other men, but justly demands from all, equally with himself, subjection to the word of God.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p27"></A><i>Or an angel from heaven.</i> In order to destroy more completely the pretensions of the false apostles, he rises so high as to speak of angels; and, on the supposition that they taught a different doctrine, he does not satisfy himself with saying that they were not entitled to be heard, but declares that they ought to be held accursed. Some may think, that it was absurd to engage in a controversy 		with angels about his doctrine; but a just view of the whole matter will enable any one to perceive, that this part of the apostle&#8217;s proceedings was proper and necessary. It is impossible, no doubt, for angels from heaven to teach anything else than the certain truth of God. But when the credit due to doctrines which God had revealed concerning the salvation of men was the subject of controversy, he did not reckon it enough to disclaim the judgment of men, without declining, at the same time, 		the authority of angels.</p>

 		 though his argument is derived from an impossibility, it is not superfluous. This exaggerated language must, have contributed greatly to strengthen the confidence in Paul&#8217;s preaching. His opponents, by employing the lofty titles of men, attempted to press hard on him and on his doctrine. He meets them by the bold assertion, that even angels are unable to shake his authority. This is no disparagement to angels. To promote the glory of God by every possible means 		was the design of their creation. He who endeavors, in a pious manner, to accomplish this object, by an apparently desrespectful mention of their name, detracts nothing from their high rank. This language not only exhibits, in an impressive manner, the majesty of the word of God, but yields, also, a powerful confirmation to our faith while, in reliance on that word, we feel ourselves at liberty to treat even angels with defiance and scorn. When he says, &#8220;let him be accursed,&#8221; the meaning must 		be, &#8220;let him be held by you as accursed.&#8221; In expounding <a name="iii.iii.ii-p29.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003">1Co 12:3</a><a name="iii.iii.ii-p29.2"></A>, we had occasion to speak of the word &#7936;&#957;&#8049;&#952;&#949;&#956;&#945;.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A>

 		 Observe the expression &#8212; <i>ye have received</i>; for he uniformly insists, that they must not regard the gospel as something unknown, existing in the air, or in their own imaginations. He exhorts them to entertain a firm and serious conviction, that the doctrine which they had received and embraced is the true gospel of Christ. Nothing can be more inconsistent with the nature of faith than a feeble, wavering assent. 		What, then, must be the consequence, if ignorance of the nature and character of the gospel shall lead to hesitation?

First, they tell us, that we have not in our possession the whole of Paul&#8217;s preaching, and cannot know what it contained, unless the Galatians who heard it shall be raised from the dead, in order to appear as witnesses. Next, they assert, that it is not every kind of addition which is forbidden, but that <i>other gospels</i> only are condemned. What Paul&#8217;s doctrine was, so far as it concerns us to know, may be learned with sufficient clearness from his writings. Of this gospel, it is plain, the whole of Popery is a dreadful perversion. And from the nature of the case, we remark in conclusion, it is manifest that any spurious doctrine whatever is at variance with Paul&#8217;s preaching; so that these cavils will avail them nothing.</p>  <a name="iii.iii.iii"></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p14"></A>Having extolled so confidently his own preaching, he now shows that this was no idle or empty boast. He supports his assertion by two arguments. The first is, that he was not prompted by ambition, or flattery, or any similar passion, to accommodate himself to the views of men. The second and far stronger argument is, that he was not the author of the gospel, but delivered faithfully what he had received from God.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p15"></A>10. <i>For do I now persuade according to men or according to God?</i> The ambiguity of the Greek construction in this passage, has given rise to a variety of expositions. Some render it, <i>Do I now persuade men or God?</i>   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A>
 		 Others interpret the words &#8220;God&#8221; and &#8220;men,&#8221; as meaning divine and human concerns. This sense would agree very well with the context, if it were not too wide a departure from the words. The view which I have preferred is more natural; for nothing is more common with the Greeks than to leave the preposition &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048;, <i>according to</i>, to be understood.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p17"></A>Paul is speaking, not about the subject of his preaching, but about the purpose of his own mind, which could not refer so properly to men as to God. The disposition of the speaker, it must be owned, may have some influence on his doctrine. As corruption of doctrine springs from ambition, avarice, or any other sinful passion, so the truth is maintained in its purity by an upright conscience. And so he contends that his doctrine is 		sound, because it is not modified so as to gratify men.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p18"></A><i>Or, do I seek to please men?</i> This second clause differs not much, and yet it differs somewhat from the former; for the desire of obtaining favor is one motive for speaking &#8220;according to men.&#8221; When there reigns in our hearts such ambition, that we desire to regulate our discourse so as to obtain the favor of men, our instructions cannot be sincere. Paul therefore declares, that he is in no 		degree chargeable with this vice; and, the more boldly to repel the calumnious insinuation, he employs the interrogative form of speech; for interrogations carry the greater weight, when our opponents are allowed an opportunity of replying, if they have anything to say. This expresses the great boldness which Paul derived from the testimony of a good conscience; for he knew that he had discharged his duty in such a manner as not to be liable to any reproach of that kind. (<a name="iii.iii.iii-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001">Ac 23:1</a><a name="iii.iii.iii-p18.1"></A>; <a name="iii.iii.iii-p18.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012">2Co 1:12</a><a name="iii.iii.iii-p18.2"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p19"></A><i>If I yet pleased men</i>  This is a remarkable sentiment; that ambitious persons, that is, those who hunt after the applause of men, cannot serve Christ. He declares for himself, that he had freely renounced the estimation of men, in order to devote himself entirely to the service of Christ; and, in this respect, he contrasts his present position with that which he 		occupied at a former period of life. He had been regarded with the highest esteem, had received from every quarter loud applause; and, therefore, if he had chosen to please men, he would not have found it necessary to change his condition. But we may draw from it the general doctrine which I have stated, that those who resolve to serve Christ faithfully, must have boldness to despise the favor of men.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p20"></A>The word <i>men</i> is here employed in a limited sense; for the ministers of Christ ought not to labor for the express purpose of displeasing men. But there are various classes of men. Those to whom Christ &#8220;is precious,&#8221; (<a name="iii.iii.iii-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007">1Pe 2:7</a><a name="iii.iii.iii-p20.1"></A>,) are men whom we should 		endeavor to please in Christ; while they who choose that the true doctrine shall give place to their own passions, are men to whom we must give no countenance. And godly, upright pastors, will always find it necessary to contend with the offenses of those who choose that, on all points, their own wishes shall be gratified; for the Church will always contain hypocrites and wicked men, by whom their own lusts will be preferred to the word of God. And even good men, either through ignorance, or 		through weak prejudice, are sometimes tempted by the devil to be displeased with the faithful warnings of their pastor. Our duty, therefore, is not to take alarm at any kind of offenses, provided, at the same time, that we do not excite in weak minds a prejudice against Christ himself.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p21"></A>Many interpret this passage in a different manner, as implying an admission to the following effect: &#8220;If I pleased men, <i>then I should not be the servant of Christ</i>. I own it, but who shall bring such a charge against me? Who does not see that I do not court the favor of men?&#8221; But I prefer the former view, that Paul is relating how large an amount of the estimation of 		men he had relinquished, in order to devote himself to the service of Christ.</p>

 		 but one which he is prepared to prove; and thus introduces himself in a manner well adapted to a serious subject.

We must take into account, all along, the weapons with which the false apostles attacked him, alleging that his gospel was defective and spurious; 		that he had obtained it from an inferior and incompetent teacher; and that his imperfect education led him to make unguarded statements. They boasted, on the other hand, that they had been instructed by the highest apostles, with whose views they were most intimately acquainted. It was therefore necessary that Paul should state his doctrine in opposition to the whole world, and should rest it on this ground, that he had acquired it not in the school of any man, but by revelation from God.

His divine instruction, communicated to him by immediate inspiration, did not render it improper that a man should be employed in teaching him, were it only to give weight to his public ministry.

<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p24"></A><b>15.</b> <i>But after that it pleased God. </i>This is the second part of the narrative, and relates to his miraculous conversion. He tells us, first, that he had been called by the grace of God to preach Christ among the Gentiles; and, next, that as soon as he had been called, without consulting the apostles, he unhesitatingly proceeded to the performance 		of the work, which, he felt assured, had been enjoined upon him by the appointment of God. In the construction of the words, Erasmus differs from the Vulgate. He connects them in the following manner: &#8220;When it pleased God that I should preach Christ among the Gentiles, who called me for this purpose that he might reveal him <i>by me</i>.&#8221; But I prefer the old translation; for Christ had been revealed to Paul before he received a command to preach. 		Admitting that Erasmus were right in translating &#7952;&#957; &#7952;&#956;&#959;&#8054;, <i>by me</i>, still the clause, <i>that I might preach</i>, is added for the purpose of describing the kind of revelation.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p25"></A>Paul&#8217;s reasoning does not, at first sight, appear so strong; for although, when he had been converted to Christianity, he instantly, and without consulting the apostles, entered into the office of preaching the gospel, it does not thence follow that he had been appointed to that office by the revelation of Christ. But the arguments which he employs are various, and, when they are all collected, will be found sufficiently strong to 		establish his conclusion. He argues, first, that he had been called by the grace of God; next, that his apostleship had been acknowledged by the other apostles; and the other arguments follow. Let the reader, therefore, remember to read the whole narrative together, and to draw the inference, not from single parts, but from the whole.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p26"></A><i>Who had separated me.</i> This separation was the purpose of God, by which Paul was appointed to the apostolic office, before he knew that he was born. The calling followed afterwards at the proper time, when the Lord made known his will concerning him, and commanded him to proceed to the work. God had, no doubt, decreed, before the foundation of the world, what he would do with regard to every one 		of us, and had assigned to every one, by his secret counsel, his respective place. But the sacred writers frequently introduce those three steps: the eternal predestination of God, the destination from the womb, and the calling, which is the effect and accomplishment of both.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p27"></A>The word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah, though expressed a little differently from this passage, has entirely the same meaning.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p28"></A>&#8220;Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee; and before thou camest forth from the womb I sanctified thee; a prophet to the nations have I made thee.&#8221; (<a name="iii.iii.iv-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#005">Jer 1:5</a><a name="iii.iii.iv-p28.1"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p29"></A>Before they even existed, Jeremiah had been set apart to the office of a prophet, and Paul to that of an apostle; but he is said to separate us from the womb, because the design of our being sent into the world is, that he may accomplish, in us, what he has decreed. The calling is delayed till its proper time, when God has prepared us for the office which he commands us to undertake.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p30"></A>Paul&#8217;s words may therefore be read thus: &#8220;When it pleased God to reveal his Son, by me, who called me, as he had formerly separated me.&#8221; He intended to assert, that his calling depends on the secret election of God; and that he was ordained an apostle, not because by his own industry he had fitted himself for undertaking so high an office, or because God had accounted him worthy of having it bestowed upon him, but because, before he was 		born, he had been set apart by the secret purpose of God.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p31"></A>Thus, in his usual manner, he traces his calling to the good pleasure of God. This deserves our careful attention; for it shows us that we owe it to the goodness of God, not only that we have been elected and adopted to everlasting life, but that he deigns to make use of our services, who would otherwise have been altogether useless, and that he assigns to us a lawful calling, in which we may be employed. What had Paul, before he was 		born, to entitle him to so high an honor? In like manner we ought to believe, that it is entirely the gift of God, and not obtained by our own industry, that we have been called to govern the Church.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p32"></A>The subtle distinctions into which some commentators have entered in explaining the word <i>separated</i>, are altogether foreign to the subject. God is said to <i>separate</i> us, not because he bestows any peculiar disposition of mind which distinguishes us from others, but because he appoints us by his own purpose  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A>
 		. Although the apostle had most explicitly attributed his calling to the free grace of God, when he pronounced that voluntary separation from the womb to be the origin of it, yet he repeats the direct statement, both that, by his commendation of Divine grace, he may take away all grounds of boasting, and that he may testify his own gratitude to God. On this subject he is wont freely to expatiate, even when he has no controversy with the false apostles.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.iv-p34"></A><a name="iii.iii.iv-p34.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p35"></A><b>16.</b> <i>To reveal his Son to me</i>. If we read it, &#8220;to reveal <i>by</i> <i>me</i>,&#8221; it will express the design of the apostleship, which is to make Christ known. And how was this to be accomplished? By preaching him among the Gentiles, which the false apostles treated 		as a crime. But I consider the Greek phrase &#7952;&#957; &#949;&#956;&#959;&#8054;   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A>
 		 to be a Hebrew idiom for <i>to me</i>; for the Hebrew particle <a name="iii.iii.iv-p36.2"></A>&#1489; (beth) is frequently redundant, as all who know that language are well aware. The meaning will therefore be, that Christ was revealed <i>to</i> Paul, not that he might alone enjoy, and silently retain in 		his own bosom the knowledge of Christ, but that he might preach among the Gentiles the Savior whom he had known.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p37"></A><i>Immediately I conferred not</i>. To <i>confer with flesh and blood</i>, is to consult with flesh and blood. So far as the meaning of these words is concerned, his intention was absolutely to have nothing to do with any human counsels. The general expression, as will presently appear from the context, includes all men, and all the prudence or wisdom which 		they may possess.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A>
 		 He even makes a direct reference to the apostles, for the express purpose of exhibiting, in a stronger light, the immediate calling of God. Relying on the authority of God alone, and asking nothing more, he proceeded to discharge the duty of preaching the gospel.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.iv-p39"></A><a name="iii.iii.iv-p39.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p40"></A><b>17.</b> <i>Neither did I return to Jerusalem.</i> What he had just written is now explained, and more fully stated. As if he had said, &#8220;I did not ask the authority of any man,&#8221; not even of the apostles themselves. It is a mistake to suppose, that, because the apostles are now separately mentioned, they are not included in the words, <i>flesh and blood</i>. Nothing new or different is here added, but merely a clearer explanation of what had been already said. And no disrespect to the apostles is implied in that expression. For the purpose of shewing that he did not owe his commission to man, the false boasting of unprincipled men laid him under the necessity of contrasting. the authority of the apostles themselves with the authority of God. When a creature is brought into comparison with God, 		however contemptuous or humiliating may be the language employed, he has no reason to complain.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p41"></A><i>But I went into Arabia</i>. In the Acts of the Apostles, Luke has omitted these three years. In like manner, there are other passages of the history which he does not touch; and hence the slander of those who seek to build on this a charge of inconsistency in the narratives is ridiculous. Let godly readers consider the severe temptation with which Paul was called to struggle at the very 		commencement of his course. He who but yesterday, for the sake of doing him honor, had been sent to Damascus with a magnificent retinue, is now compelled to wander as an exile in a foreign land: but he does not lose his courage.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.iv-p42"></A><a name="iii.iii.iv-p42.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p43"></A><b>18.</b> <i>Then after three years</i>. It was not till three years after he had begun to discharge the apostolic office, that he <i>went up to Jerusalem</i>. Thus, he did not, at the outset, receive the calling of men. But lest it should be supposed that he had separate interests from theirs, and was desirous to 		avoid their society, he tells us that he went up for the express purpose<i> to see </i>  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A>
 		 <i>Peter. </i>  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A>
 		 Although he had not waited for their sanction before undertaking the office, yet it was not against their will, but with their full consent and approbation, that he held the rank of an apostle. He is desirous to shew that at no period was he at variance with the apostles, and that even now he is in full harmony with all their views. By mentioning the short time that he remained there, he shews that he had come, not with a view to learn, but solely for mutual 		intercourse.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.iv-p46"></A><a name="iii.iii.iv-p46.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p47"></A><b>19.</b> <i>But I saw no other of the apostles.</i> This is added to make it evident that he had but one object in his journey, and attended to nothing else.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p48"></A><i>Except James.</i> Who this James was, deserves inquiry. Almost all the ancients are agreed that he was one of the disciples, whose surname was &#8220;Oblias&#8221; and &#8220;The Just,&#8221; and that he presided over the church at Jerusalem.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A>
 		 Yet others think that he was the son of Joseph by another wife, and others (which is more probable) that he was the cousin of Christ by the mother&#8217;s side:   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A>
 		 but as he is here mentioned among the apostles, I do not hold that opinion. Nor is there any force in the defense offered by Jerome, that the word Apostle is sometimes applied to others besides the twelve; for the subject under consideration is the highest rank of apostleship, and we shall presently see that he was considered one of the chief <i>pillars</i>. (<a name="iii.iii.iv-p50.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009">Ga 2:9</a><a name="iii.iii.iv-p50.2"></A>.) It appears to me, therefore, far more probable, that the person of whom he is speaking is the son of Alpheus.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A>
</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p52"></A>The rest of the apostles, there is reason to believe, were scattered through various countries; for they did not idly remain in one place. Luke relates that Paul was brought by Barnabas to the apostles. (<a name="iii.iii.iv-p52.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#027">Ac 9:27</a><a name="iii.iii.iv-p52.1"></A>.) This must be understood to relate, not to the twelve, but to these two apostles, who alone were at that time residing in Jerusalem.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.iv-p53"></A><a name="iii.iii.iv-p53.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p54"></A><b>20.</b> <i>Now the things which I write to you</i>. This affirmation extends to the whole narrative. The vast earnestness of Paul on this subject is evinced by his resorting to an oath, which cannot lawfully be employed but on great and weighty occasions. Nor is it wonderful that he insists with so much earnestness on this point; for we have already seen 		to what expedients the impostors had recourse in order to take from him the name and credit of an apostle. Now the modes of swearing used by good men deserve our attention; for we learn from them that an oath must be viewed simply as an appeal to the judgment-seat of God for the integrity and truth of our words and actions; and such a transaction ought to be guided by religion and the fear of God.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.iv-p55"></A><a name="iii.iii.iv-p55.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p56"></A><b>22.</b> <i>And was unknown by face</i>. This appears to be added for the sake of shewing more strongly the wickedness and malignity of his slanderers. If the churches of Judea who <i>had only heard</i> respecting him, were led to give glory to God for the astonishing change which he had wrought in Paul, how 		disgraceful was it that those who had beheld the fruits of his amazing labors should not have acted a similar part! If the mere report was enough for the former, why did not the facts before their eyes satisfy the latter?</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.iv-p57"></A><a name="iii.iii.iv-p57.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p58"></A><b>23.</b> <i>Which once he destroyed</i>. This does not mean that <i>faith</i>   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A>
 		 may actually be destroyed, but that he lessened its influence on the minds of weak men. Besides, it is the will, rather than the deed, that is here expressed.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.iv-p60"></A><a name="iii.iii.iv-p60.1"></A></p>

 		 This was an evident proof that his ministry was approved by all the churches of Judea, and approved in such a manner, that they broke out into admiration and praise of the wonderful power of God. Thus he indirectly reproves their malice, by showing that their venom and slanders could have no other effect than to hide the glory of God, which, as the apostles admitted and openly acknowledged, shone brightly in the apostleship of Paul.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p63"></A>This reminds us of the light in which the saints of the Lord ought to be regarded by us. When we behold men adorned with the gifts of God, such is our depravity, or ingratitude, or proneness to superstition, that we worship them as gods, unmindful of Him by whom those gifts were bestowed. These words remind us, on the contrary, to lift up our eyes to the Great Author, and to ascribe to Him what is his own, while they at the same time 		inform us that an occasion of offering praise to God was furnished by the change produced on Paul, from being an enemy to becoming a minister of Christ.</p>

This word, which we render <i>persuade</i>, frequently signifies &#8216;to obtain by treaty,&#8217; or, &#8216;to endeavor the friendship and good will of any person.&#8217; Thus in <a name="iii.iii.iii-p16.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#014">Mt 28:14</a><a name="iii.iii.iii-p16.2"></A>, the chief-priests tell the soldiers, whom they corrupted, to give a false report: &#8216;If this come to the governor&#8217;s ears, we will <i>persuade</i> him, and secure you, that is, prevail with him to be favorable to you, and save you from punishment.&#8217; Thus, <a name="iii.iii.iii-p16.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#020">Ac 12:20</a><a name="iii.iii.iii-p16.3"></A>, <a name="iii.iii.iii-p16.4"></A>&#960;&#949;&#8055;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#914;&#955;&#8049;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;, we render, &#8216;having made Blastus their friend.&#8217; Vid. Pind. Ol. 3:28. And in the Apocryphal book of Maccabees, (<a name="iii.iii.iii-p16.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/apo/ma2004.htm#045">2Ma 4:45</a><a name="iii.iii.iii-p16.5"></A>,) when Menelaus found himself convicted of his crimes, he promised Ptolemy a large sum of money, <a name="iii.iii.iii-p16.6"></A>&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#8051;&#945;, &#8216;to pacify the king,&#8217; to prevent his displeasure, and secure his favor. And thus, in the place before us, &#8216;to persuade God,&#8217; is to endeavor to secure his approbation; which, the Apostle assures the Galatians, was his great and only view, as well as his great support, under the censure and displeasure of men, for preaching the pure and uncorrupted doctrines of the gospel.&#8221; &#8212; Chandler.</p> 		</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.iii.iv-p38"></A> &#8220;The expression, &#8216;flesh and blood,&#8217; is used to denote men. Thus when Peter confessed to our Lord, &#8216;Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God,&#8217; Jesus answered, &#8216;Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee.&#8217; (<a name="iii.iii.iv-p38.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017">Mt 16:17</a><a name="iii.iii.iv-p38.1"></A>.) That is, no man hath made this discovery; and thus it hath the same meaning in the place before us. But as the apostle speaks 			 of his countrymen and equals in age, in the verses before, I apprehend he particularly means them, and that he intends to assure the Galatians, that, notwithstanding his former zeal for the law and the traditions of the Jews, yet that, after his extraordinary conversion, he had no longer any dependence on them, nor sought the least direction from the wisest among them.&#8221; &#8212; Chandler.</p> 		</P>
