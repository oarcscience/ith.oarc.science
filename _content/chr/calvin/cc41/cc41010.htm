<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p14"></A><b>1.</b> <i>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in any fault</i>   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">94</FONT></A>
 		 Ambition is a serious and alarming evil. But hardly less injury is frequently done by unseasonable and excessive severity, which, under the plausible name of zeal, springs in many instances from pride, and from dislike and contempt of the brethren. Most men seize on the faults of brethren as an occasion of insulting them, and of using reproachful and cruel language. Were the pleasure they take in upbraiding equalled by their desire to produce amendment, they would 		act in a different manner. Reproof, and often sharp and severe reproof, must be administered to offenders. But while we must not shrink from a faithful testimony against sin, neither must we omit to mix oil with the vinegar.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p16"></A>We are here taught to correct the faults of brethren in a mild manner, and to consider no rebukes as partaking a religious and Christian character which do not breathe the spirit of meekness. To gain this object, he explains the design of pious reproofs, which is<i>, to restore him who is fallen,</i> to place him in his former condition. That design will never be accomplished 		by violence, or by a disposition to accuse, or by fierceness of manner or language; and consequently, we must display a gentle and meek spirit, if we intend to heal our brother. And lest any man should satisfy himself with assuming the outward form, he demands <i>the spirit of meekness</i>; for no man is prepared for chastising a brother till he has succeeded in acquiring a gentle spirit.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_94"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">95</FONT></A>
</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p18"></A>Another argument for gentleness in correcting brethren is contained in the expression, &#8220;if a man be <i>overtaken</i>.&#8221; If he has been carried away through want of consideration, or through the cunning arts of a deceiver, it would be cruel to treat such a man with harshness. Now, we know that the devil is always lying in wait, and has a thousand ways of leading us astray. When 		we perceive a brother to have transgressed, let us consider that he has fallen into the snares of Satan; let us be moved with compassion, and prepare our minds to exercise forgiveness. But offenses and falls of this description must undoubtedly be distinguished from deep seated crimes, accompanied by deliberate and obstinate disregard of the authority of God. Such a display of wicked and perverse disobedience to God must be visited with greater severity, for what advantage would be gained by 		gentle treatment? The particle<i> if also</i>, (&#7952;&#945;&#768;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054;,) implies that not only the weak who have been tempted, but those who have yielded to temptation, shall receive forbearance.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p19"></A><i>Ye who are spiritual</i>. This is not spoken in irony; for, however spiritual they might be, still they were not wholly filled with the Spirit. It belongs to such persons to raise up the fallen. To what better purpose can their superior attainments be applied than to promote the salvation of the brethren? The more eminently any man is endowed with Divine grace, the more strongly is he bound to 		consult the edification of those who have been less favored. But such is our folly, that in our best duties we are apt to fail, and therefore need the exhortation which the apostle gives to guard against the influence of carnal views.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p20"></A><i>Considering thyself</i>. It is not without reason that the apostle passes from the plural to the singular number. He gives weight to his admonition, when he addresses each person individually, and bids him look carefully into himself. &#8220;Whoever thou art that takest upon thee the office of reproving others, look to thyself.&#8221; Nothing is more difficult than to bring us to acknowledge or examine our own 		weakness. Whatever may be our acuteness in detecting the faults of others, we do not see, as the saying is, &#8220;the wallet that hangs behind our own back;&#8221;   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">96</FONT></A>
 		 and therefore, to arouse us to greater activity, he employs the singular number.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p22"></A>These words may admit of two senses. As we acknowledge that we are liable to sin, we more willingly grant that forgiveness to others which, in our turn, we expect will be extended to us. Some interpret them in this manner: &#8220;Thou who art a sinner, and needest the compassion of thy brethren, oughtest not to show thyself fierce and implacable to others.&#8221;  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">97</FONT></A>
 		But I would rather choose to expound them as a warning given by Paul, that, in correcting others, we should not ourselves commit sin. There is a danger here which deserves our most careful attention, and against which it is difficult to guard; for nothing is more easy than to exceed the proper limits. The word <i>tempt</i>, however, may very properly be taken in this passage as extended to the whole life. Whenever we have occasion to pronounce censure, let us begin with ourselves, 		and, remembering our own weakness, let us be indulgent to others.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.viii.i-p24"></A><a name="iii.viii.i-p24.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p25"></A><b>2.</b> <i>Bear ye one another&#8217;s burdens</i>. The weaknesses or sins, under which we groan, are called <i>burdens</i>. This phrase is singularly appropriate in an exhortation to kind behavior, for nature dictates to us that those who bend under a burden ought to be relieved. He enjoins us to <i>bear</i> the burdens. We must not indulge or overlook the sins by which our brethren are pressed down, but relieve them, &#8212; which can only be done by mild and friendly correction. There are many adulterers and thieves, many wicked and abandoned characters of every description, who would willingly make Christ an accomplice in their crimes. All would choose to lay upon believers the task of bearing their burdens. But as the apostle had immediately before exhorted 		us to <i>restore</i> a brother, the manner in which Christians are required to <i>bear one another&#8217;s burdens</i> cannot be mistaken.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p26"></A><i>And so fulfill the law of Christ</i>. The word <i>law</i>, when applied here to Christ, serves the place of an argument. There is an implied contrast between the law of Christ and the law of Moses. &#8220;If you are very desirous to keep a law, Christ enjoins on you a law which you are bound to prefer to all others, and that is, to cherish kindness towards each 		other. He who has not this has nothing. On the other hand, he tells us, that, when every one compassionately assists his neighbor, the law of Christ is <i>fulfilled</i>; by which he intimates that every thing which does not proceed from love is superfluous; for the composition of the Greek word &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#8061;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#949;, conveys the idea of what is absolutely perfect. But as no man performs in every respect what 		Paul requires, we are still at a distance from perfection. He who comes the nearest to it with regard to others, is yet far distant with respect to God.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.viii.i-p27"></A><a name="iii.viii.i-p27.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p28"></A><b>3.</b> <i>For if a man think himself</i>. There is an ambiguity in the construction, but Paul&#8217;s meaning is clear. The phrase, <i>When he is nothing</i>, appears at first view to mean, &#8220;if any person, who is in reality nothing, claims to be something;&#8221; as there are many men of no real worth who are elated by a 		foolish admiration of themselves. But the meaning is more general, and may be thus expressed: &#8220;Since all men are nothing, he who wishes to appear something, and persuades himself that he is somebody, deceives himself.&#8221; First, then, he declares that we are nothing, by which he means, that we have nothing of our own of which we have a right to boast, but are destitute of every thing good: so that all our glorying is mere vanity. Secondly, he infers that they who claim something as their own 		deceive themselves. Now, since nothing excites our indignation more than that others should impose upon us, it argues the height of folly that we should willingly impose upon ourselves. This consideration will render us much more candid to others. Whence proceeds fierce insult or haughty sternness, but from this, that every one exalts himself in his own estimation, and proudly despises others? Let arrogance be removed, and we shall all discover the greatest modesty in our conduct towards each 		other.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.viii.i-p29"></A><a name="iii.viii.i-p29.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p30"></A><b>4.</b> <i>But let every man prove his own work</i>. By a powerful blow, Paul has already struck down the pride of man. But it frequently happens that, by comparing ourselves with others, the low opinion which we form of them leads us to entertain a high opinion of ourselves. Paul declares that no such comparison ought to be allowed. Let no man, he says, 		measure himself by the standard of another, or please himself with the thought, that others appear to him less worthy of approbation. Let him lay aside all regard to other men, examine his own conscience, and inquire what is <i>his own work</i>. It is not what we gain by detracting from others, but what we have without any comparison, that can be regarded as true praise.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p31"></A>Some consider Paul to be speaking in irony. &#8220;Thou flatterest thyself by a comparison with the faults of others; but if thou wilt consider who thou art, thou wilt then enjoy the praise which is justly due to thee.&#8221; In other words, no praise whatever shall be thine; because there is no man by whom the smallest portion of praise is really deserved. In conformity with this view, the words that follow, <i>every man shall bear his own burden</i>, are supposed to mean, that it is usual for every man to bear his own burden. But the plain and direct sense of the words agrees better with the apostle&#8217;s reasoning. &#8220;With respect to thyself alone, and not by comparison with others, thou wilt have praise.&#8221; I am well aware that the next sentence, which annihilates all the glory of man, has been regarded as justifying the ironical interpretation. But the glorying of which 		this passage treats, is that of a good conscience, in which the Lord allows his people to indulge, and which Paul elsewhere expresses in very animated language.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p32"></A>&#8220;Paul earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.&#8221;<br> 		(<a name="iii.viii.i-p32.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001">Ac 23:1</a><a name="iii.viii.i-p32.2"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p33"></A>This is nothing more than an acknowledgment of Divine grace, which reflects no praise whatever on man, but excites him to give God the glory. Such a reason for glorying do the godly find in themselves; and they ascribe it, not to their own merits, but to the riches of the grace of God.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p34"></A>&#8220;For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of a good conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world.&#8221;<br> 		(<a name="iii.viii.i-p34.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012">2Co 1:12</a><a name="iii.viii.i-p34.2"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p35"></A>Our Lord himself instructs us:</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p36"></A>&#8220;But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet; and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.&#8221;<br> 		(<a name="iii.viii.i-p36.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#006">Mt 6:6</a><a name="iii.viii.i-p36.2"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p37"></A>Strictly speaking, he makes no assertion, but leads us to conclude, that, when a man is valued for his own worth, and not for the baseness of others, the praise is just and substantial. The statement is therefore conditional, and imports that none are entitled to be regarded as good men, who are not found to be so, apart from the consideration of others.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.viii.i-p38"></A><a name="iii.viii.i-p38.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.i-p39"></A><b>5.</b> <i>For every man shall bear his own burdens</i>. To destroy sloth and pride, he brings before us the judgment of God, in which every individual for himself, and without a comparison with others, will give an account of his life. It is thus that we are deceived; for, if a man who has but one eye is placed among the blind, he considers his vision to 		be perfect; and a tawny person among negroes thinks himself white. The apostle affirms that the false conclusions to which we are thus conducted will find no place in the judgment of God; because there every one will bear his own burden, and none will stand acquitted by others from their own sins. This is the true meaning of the words.</p>  <a name="iii.viii.ii"></A>  	  		 		     		  
<p class="TableCaption15"><a name="iii.viii.ii-p1"></A><a name="iii.viii.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006">Galatians 6:6-10</a><a name="iii.viii.ii-p1.1"></A></p>

<p><a name="iii.viii.ii-p14"></A><b>6.</b> <i>Let him that is taught in the word</i>. It is probable that the teachers and ministers of the word were at that time neglected. This shewed the basest ingratitude. How disgraceful is it to defraud of their temporal support those by whom our souls are fed! &#8212; to refuse an earthly recompense to those from whom we receive 		heavenly benefits! But it is, and always has been, the disposition of the world, freely to bestow on the ministers of Satan every luxury, and hardly to supply godly pastors with necessary food. Though it does not become us to indulge too much in complaint, or to be too tenacious of our rights, yet Paul found himself called upon to exhort the Galatians to perform this part of their duty. He was the more ready to do so, because he had no private interest in the matter, but consulted the universal 		benefit of the Church, without any regard to his own advantage. He saw that the ministers of the word were neglected, because the word itself was despised; for if the word be truly esteemed, its ministers will always receive kind and honorable treatment. It is one of the tricks of Satan to defraud godly ministers of support, that the Church may be deprived of such ministers.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">98</FONT></A>
 		 An earnest desire to preserve a gospel ministry, led to Paul&#8217;s recommendation that proper attention should be paid to good and faithful pastors.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.ii-p16"></A><i>The word</i> is here put, by way of eminence, (&#954;&#945;&#964; &#8127; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8052;&#957;,) for the doctrine of godliness. Support is declared to be due to those by whom we <i>are taught in the word</i>. Under this designation the Papal system supports idle bellies of dumb men, and fierce wild beasts, who have nothing in common with 		the doctrine of Christ. <i>In all good things</i>. He does not propose that no limit should be set to their worldly enjoyments, or that they should revel in superfluous abundance, but merely that none of the necessary supports of life should be withheld. Ministers ought to be satisfied with moderate fare, and the danger which attends pomp and luxury ought to be prevented. To supply their real necessities, let believers cheerfully devote any part of 		their property that may be required for the services of devout and holy teachers. What return will they make for the invaluable treasure of eternal life, which is communicated to them by the preaching of those men?</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.viii.ii-p17"></A><a name="iii.viii.ii-p17.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.ii-p18"></A><b>7.</b> <i>God is not mocked</i>. The design of this observation is to reply to the dishonest excuses which are frequently pleaded. One alleges that he has a family to support, and another asserts that he has no superfluity of wealth to spend in liberality or profusion. The consequence is, that, while such multitudes withhold their aid, the few persons who 		do their duty are generally unable to contribute the necessary support. These apologies Paul utterly rejects, for a reason which the world little considers, that this transaction is with God. The supply of a man&#8217;s bodily wants is not the sole question, but involves the degree of our regard for Christ and his gospel. This passage contains evidence that the custom of treating faithful ministers with scorn did not originate in the present day; but their wicked taunts will not pass 		unpunished.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.ii-p19"></A><i>For whatsoever a man soweth</i>. Our liberality is restrained by the supposition, that whatever passes into the hands of another is lost to ourselves, and by the alarm we feel about our own prospects in life. Paul meets these views by a comparison drawn from seed-time, which, he tells us, is a fit representation of acts of beneficence. On this subject we had occasion to speak, in expounding the 		Second Epistle to the Corinthians, where the same metaphor was employed. Happy would it be for us, if this truth were deeply impressed upon our minds. How &#8220;very gladly&#8221; would we &#8220;spend and be spent&#8221; (<a name="iii.viii.ii-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#015">2Co 12:15</a><a name="iii.viii.ii-p19.1"></A>) for the good of our neighbours, encouraged by the hope of the coming harvest! No operation is more cheerfully performed by husbandmen than throwing the 		seed into the ground. They are enabled to wait with patience during nine months of the year, by the expectation of reaping a corruptible harvest, while our minds are not properly affected by the hope of a blessed immortality.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.viii.ii-p20"></A><a name="iii.viii.ii-p20.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.ii-p21"></A><b>8.</b> <i>For he that soweth to his flesh</i>. Having stated the general sentiment, he now divides it into parts. To <i>sow to the flesh</i>, is to look forward to the wants of the present life, without any regard to a future life. They who do this will gather fruit corresponding to the seed which they have sown, 		&#8212; will heap up that which shall miserably perish. <i>To sow in the flesh</i>, (<a name="iii.viii.ii-p21.1"></A><i>seminare in carne</i>,) is supposed by some to mean indulgence in the lusts of the flesh, and corruption to mean destruction; but the former exposition agrees better with the context. In departing from the old translation and from Erasmus, I 		have not acted rashly. The Greek words, &#8001; &#963;&#960;&#949;&#8055;&#961;&#969;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#963;&#8049;&#961;&#954;&#945; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#8166;, literally signify, <i>he that soweth into his flesh</i>. And what else does this mean, but to be so entirely devoted to the flesh, as to direct all our thoughts to its interests or convenience?</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.ii-p22"></A><i>But he that soweth to the spirit</i>. By <i>the spirit</i> I understand the spiritual life, to which they are said to sow whose views are directed more to heaven than to earth, and whose life is regulated by the desire of reaching the kingdom of God. From their spiritual employments they will reap in heaven incorruptible fruit. Those employments are 		denominated spiritual on account of their end, though in some respects they are external and relate to the body, as in the very case now under consideration of supporting pastors. If the Papists shall endeavor, in their usual manner, to build upon these words the righteousness of works, we have already shewn how easily their absurdities may be exposed. Though eternal life is a reward, it does not follow either that we are justified by works, or that works are meritorious of salvation. The 		undeserved kindness of God appears in the very act of honoring the works which his grace has enabled us to perform, by promising to them a reward to which they are not entitled.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.ii-p23"></A>Is a more complete solution of the question demanded?</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.ii-p24"></A><b>1.</b> We have no good works which God rewards but those which we derive from his grace.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.ii-p25"></A><b>2.</b> The good works which we perform by the guidance and direction of the Holy Spirit, are the fruits of that adoption which is an act of free grace.</p>

Well-doing</i> (&#954;&#945;&#955;&#8056;&#957;) does not simply mean doing our duty, but the performance of acts of kindness, and has a reference to men. We are instructed <i>not to be weary</i> in assisting our neighbours, in performing good 		offices, and in exercising generosity. This precept is highly necessary; for we are naturally reluctant to discharge the duties of brotherly love, and many unpleasant occurrences arise by which the ardor of the best disposed persons is apt to be cooled. We meet with many unworthy and many ungrateful persons. The vast number of necessitous cases overwhelms us, and the applications which crowd upon us from every quarter exhaust our patience. Our warmth is abated by the coolness of other men. In 		short, the world presents innumerable hinderances, which tend to lead us aside from the right path. Most properly, therefore, does Paul admonish us not to relax through weariness.</p>

Since, therefore, God has set apart the whole of the present life for ploughing and sowing, let us avail ourselves of 		the season, lest, through our negligence, it may be taken out of our power. Beginning with liberality to ministers of the gospel, Paul now makes a wider application of his doctrine, and exhorts us to <i>do good to all men</i>, but recommends to our particular regard <i>the household of faith</i>, or believers, because they belong to the same family with ourselves. This similitude is intended to excite us to 		that kind of communication which ought to be maintained among the members of one family. There are duties which we owe to all men arising out of a common nature; but the tie of a more sacred relationship, established by God himself, binds us to believers.</p>  <a name="iii.viii.iii"></A>

 		 is highly expressive, and denotes the kind looks and address which were assumed for the purpose of pleasing. He charges the false apostles with ambition. As if he had said, &#8220;When those men lay circumcision upon you as a necessary burden, do you wish to know what sort of persons they are, what are the objects of their regard or pursuit? You are mistaken if you imagine that they are at all influenced by godly zeal. To gain or preserve the favor of men is the object 		they have in view in offering this bribe.&#8221; It was because they were Jews that they adopted this method of retaining the good-will, or at least allaying the resentment, of their own nation. It is the usual practice of ambitious men meanly to fawn on those from whose favor they hope to derive advantage, and to insinuate themselves into their good graces, that, when better men have been displaced, they may enjoy the undivided power. This wicked design he lays open to the Galatians, in order to put 		them on their guard.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.iii-p14"></A><i>Only lest they should suffer persecution</i>. The pure preaching of the gospel is again designated the cross of Christ. But there is likewise an allusion to their favourite scheme of resolving to preach Christ without the cross. The deadly rage by which the Jews were animated against Paul, arose from their being unable to endure a neglect of ceremonies. To avoid persecution, those men flattered 		the Jews. Yet after all, if they had themselves kept the law, their conduct might have been suffered. On the contrary, they disturbed the whole church for the sake of their personal ease, and scrupled not to lay a tyrannical yoke on the consciences of men, that they might be entirely freed from bodily uneasiness. A dread of the cross led them to corrupt the true preaching of the cross.</p>

<p><a name="iii.viii.iii-p16"></A><b>13.</b> <i>For neither they who hold by circumcision keep the law</i>. The old version and Erasmus translate thus: <i>who are circumcised</i>.

The meaning is, &#8220;It is not from a strong attachment to the law that they bind you with the yoke of ceremonies; for, even with their own circumcision, they do not keep the law. It is no doubt under the pretext of the law that they require you to be circumcised; but, though they have themselves been circumcised, they do not perform what they enjoin upon others.&#8221; When he says, 		indeed, that they do not <i>keep the law</i>, it is doubtful whether he refers to the whole law, or to ceremonies. Some understand him as saying that the law is an intolerable burden, and therefore they do not satisfy its demands. But he rather insinuates against them a charge of insincerity, because, except when it suited their own designs, they found themselves at liberty to despise the law.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iii.viii.iii-p17"></A>Even now this disease rages everywhere with virulence. You will find many who are prompted more by ambition than by conscience to defend the tyranny of the papal system. I speak of our courtly apostles, who are attracted by the smell of a kitchen, and who pronounce, with an air of authority, that the decrees of the holy Church of Rome must be observed with reverence. And what is their own practice all the while! They 		pay no more regard to any decisions of the Roman see than to the braying of an ass, but they take care to avoid personal risk. In short, Paul had the same kind of controversy with those impostors as we now have with hypocritical professors of the gospel, who hold out to us a monstrous union between Christ and the Pope. Paul therefore declares that they are not acting the part of honest men, and that they have no other object in enjoining circumcision than to boast to the Jews of the converts 		they have made. Such is the import of the words,<i> that they may glory in your flesh</i>. &#8220;They wish to triumph over you, and to gratify their own desire of applause, by offering up your mutilated flesh to the false zealots of the law, as a token of peace and harmony.&#8221;</p>  <a name="iii.viii.iv"></A>

But my triumph and my glory are in the cross of the Son 		of God.&#8221; If the Galatians had not been utterly destitute of common sense, ought they not to have held in abhorrence the men whom they beheld making sport of their dangerous condition.</p>

In that death, &#8212; so full of disgrace and ignominy, which God himself has pronounced to be accursed, and which men are wont to view with abhorrence and shame, &#8212; in that death he will glory, because he obtains in it perfect happiness. Where man&#8217;s highest good exists, there is his glory. But why does 		not Paul seek it elsewhere? Though salvation is held out to us in the cross of Christ, what does he think of his resurrection? I answer, in the cross redemption in all its parts is found, but the resurrection of Christ does not lead us away from the cross. And let it be carefully observed, that every other kind of glorying is rejected by him as nothing short of a capital offense. &#8220;May God protect us from such a fearful calamity!&#8221; Such is the import of the phrase which Paul constantly employs, 		<i>God forbid</i></p>

In my opinion, however, it is more proper to apply it to the cross; for by it strictly we die to the world. But what is the meaning of <i>the world</i>? It is unquestionably contrasted with the <i>new creature</i>. Whatever is opposed to the spiritual kingdom of Christ is the world, because it belongs to the old man; or, in a word, <i>the world</i> is the object and aim of the old man.</p>

At all events, he means, that by the mortification of the old man he had renounced the world. Some take his meaning to be, &#8220;If the world looks upon me as 		abhorred and excommunicated, I consider the world to be condemned and accursed.&#8221; This appears to me to be overstrained, but I leave my readers to judge.</p>

Circumcision was a disguise before men, but regeneration is a truth before God.

On the contrary, the name and lineage are the sole boast of Israel according to the flesh; and this led the apostle to argue in the Epistle to the Romans, that &#8220;they are not all Israel which are of 		Israel, neither because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children.&#8221; (<a name="iii.viii.iv-p29.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006">Rom. 9:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007">7</a><a name="iii.viii.iv-p29.5"></A>.)</p>

Earthly warfare has its honors, in conferring which a general holds out to public view the bravery of a soldier. So Christ our leader has his own marks, of which he makes abundant 		use, for conferring on some of his followers a high distinction. These marks, however, differ from the other in one important respect, that they partake of the nature of the cross, and in the sight of the world are disgraceful.

The last words of the verse, &#8216;lest thou also be tempted,&#8217; seem plainly to intimate that this was the apostle&#8217;s meaning.&#8221; &#8212; Chandler.</p> 		</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.viii.i-p17"></A> &#8220;I observe an agreement in a somewhat peculiar rule of Christian conduct, as laid down in this epistle, and as exemplified in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians. It is not the repetition of the same general precept, which would have been a coincidence of little value; but it is the general precept in one place, and the application of that precept to an actual occurrence in the other. (See 			 <a name="iii.viii.i-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#006">2Co 2:6-8</a><a name="iii.viii.i-p17.1"></A>.) I have little doubt but that it was the same mind which dictated these two passages.&#8221; Paley&#8217;s Horae Paulinae.</p> 		</P>
