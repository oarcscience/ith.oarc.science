<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>Of Prayer</I>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p> <a name="iii.xxxii"></A> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xxxii-p0.1"></A>32. </h4> 
<p><a name="iii.xxxii-p1"></A>It is certain that the use of singing in churches (which I may  mention in passing) is not only very ancient, but was also used by the Apostles,  as we may gather from the words of Paul, "I will sing with the spirit, and I  will sing with the understanding also" (<a name="iii.xxxii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015">1 Corinthians 14:15</a><a name="iii.xxxii-p1.1"></A>). In like manner he says to  the Colossians, "Teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, and hymns, and  spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord" (<a name="iii.xxxii-p1.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016">Colossians 3:16</a><a name="iii.xxxii-p1.2"></A>). In  the former passage, he enjoins us to sing with the voice and the heart; in the  latter, he commends spiritual Songs, by which the pious mutually edify each  other. That it was not an universal practice, however, is attested by Augustine  (Confess. Lib. ix. cap. 7), who states that the church of Milan first began to  use singing in the time of Ambrose, when the orthodox faith being persecuted by  Justina, the mother of Valentinian, the vigils of the people were more frequent  than usual;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A>
 and that  the practice was afterwards followed by the other Western churches. He had said  a little before that the custom came from the East.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A>
 He also  intimates (Retract. Lib. ii). that it was received in Africa in his own time.  His words are, "Hilarius, a man of tribunitial rank, assailed with the bitterest  invectives he could use the custom which then began to exist at Carthage, of  singing hymns from the book of Psalms at the altar, either before the oblation,  or when it was distributed to the people; I answered him, at the request of my  brethren."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A>
 And  certainly if singing is tempered to a gravity befitting the presence of God and  angels, it both gives dignity and grace to sacred actions, and has a very  powerful tendency to stir up the mind to true zeal and ardour in prayer. We  must, however, carefully beware, lest our ears be more intent on the music than  our minds on the spiritual meaning of the words. Augustine confesses (Confess.  Lib. x. cap. 33) that the fear of this danger sometimes made him wish for the  introduction of a practice observed by Athanasius, who ordered the reader to use  only a gentle inflection of the voice, more akin to recitation than singing. But  on again considering how many advantages were derived from singing, he inclined  to the other side.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A>
 If this  moderation is used, there cannot be a doubt that the practice is most sacred and  salutary. On the other hand, songs composed merely to tickle and delight the ear  are unbecoming the majesty of the Church, and cannot but be most displeasing to  God.</p>
