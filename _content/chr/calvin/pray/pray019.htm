<p><a name="iii.xvii-p1"></A>But since no man is worthy to come forward in his own name, and  appear in the presence of God, our heavenly Father, to relieve us at once from  fear and shame, with which all must feel oppressed,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>
   has given us his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, to be our Advocate and Mediator, that under  his guidance we may approach securely, confiding that with him for our  Intercessor nothing which we ask in his name will be denied to us, as there is  nothing which the Father can deny to him (<a name="iii.xvii-p1.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005">1 Timothy 2:5</a><a name="iii.xvii-p1.3"></A>; <a name="iii.xvii-p1.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001">1 John 2:1</a><a name="iii.xvii-p1.4"></A>; see sec. 36,  37). To this it is necessary to refer all that we have previously taught  concerning faith; because, as the promise gives us Christ as our Mediator, so,  unless our hope of obtaining what we ask is founded on him, it deprives us of  the privilege of prayer. For it is impossible to think of the dread majesty of  God without being filled with alarm; and hence the sense of our own unworthiness  must keep us far away, until Christ interpose, and convert a throne of dreadful  glory into a throne of grace, as the Apostle teaches that thus we can "come  boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to  help in time of need" (<a name="iii.xvii-p1.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016">Hebrews 4:16</a><a name="iii.xvii-p1.5"></A>). And as a rule has been laid down as to  prayer, as a promise has been given that those who pray will be heard, so we are  specially enjoined to pray in the name of Christ, the promise being that we  shall obtain what we ask in his name. "Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name," says  our Saviour, "that will I do; that the Father may be glorified in the Son;"  " Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name; ask, and ye shall receive, that your  joy may be full" (<a name="iii.xvii-p1.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#013">John 14:13</a><a name="iii.xvii-p1.6"></A>; <a name="iii.xvii-p1.7"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#024">John 16:24</a><a name="iii.xvii-p1.7"></A>). Hence it is incontrovertibly clear that  those who pray to God in any other name than that of Christ contumaciously  falsify his orders, and regard his will as nothing, while they have no promise  that they shall obtain. For, as Paul says "All the promises of God in him are  yea, and in him amen;" (<a name="iii.xvii-p1.8"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020">2 Corinthians 1:20</a><a name="iii.xvii-p1.8"></A>), that is, are confirmed and fulfilled in  him.</p>
