<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>Of Prayer</I>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p> <a name="iii.xxxvii"></A> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xxxvii-p0.1"></A>37. </h4> 
<p><a name="iii.xxxvii-p1"></A>Nor let us allege that we are justly rendered timid by a  consciousness of sin, by which our Father, though mild and merciful, is daily  offended. For if among men a son cannot have a better advocate to plead his  cause with his father, and cannot employ a better intercessor to regain his lost  favour, than if he come himself suppliant and downcast, acknowledging his fault,  to implore the mercy of his father, whose paternal feelings cannot but be moved  by such entreaties, what will that "Father of all mercies, and God of all  comfort," do? (<a name="iii.xxxvii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003">2 Corinthians 1:3</a><a name="iii.xxxvii-p1.1"></A>). Will he not rather listen to the tears and groans of  his children, when supplicating for themselves (especially seeing he invites and  exhorts us to do so), than to any advocacy of others to whom the timid have  recourse, not without some semblance of despair, because they are distrustful of  their father's mildness and clemency? The exuberance of his paternal kindness he  sets before us in the parable (<a name="iii.xxxvii-p1.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#020">Luke 15:20</a><a name="iii.xxxvii-p1.2"></A>; see Calv. Comm). when the father with  open arms receives the son who had gone away from him, wasted his substance in  riotous living, and in all ways grievously sinned against him. He waits not till  pardon is asked in words, but, anticipating the request, recognizes him afar  off, runs to meet him, consoles him, and restores him to favour. By setting  before us this admirable example of mildness in a man, he designed to show in  how much greater abundance we may expect it from him who is not only a Father,  but the best and most merciful of all fathers, however ungrateful, rebellious,  and wicked sons we may be, provided only we throw ourselves upon his mercy. And  the better to assure us that he is such a Father if we are Christians, he has  been pleased to be called not only a Father, but our Father, as if we were  pleading with him after this manner, O Father, who art possessed of so much  affection for thy children, and art so ready to forgive, we thy children  approach thee and present our requests, fully persuaded that thou hast no other  feelings towards us than those of a father, though we are unworthy of such a  parent.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A>
  But as our narrow hearts are incapable of comprehending such boundless favour,  Christ is not only the earnest and pledge of our adoption, but also gives us the  Spirit as a witness of this adoption, that through him we may freely cry aloud,  Abba, Father. Whenever, therefore, we are restrained by any feeling of  hesitation, let us remember to ask of him that he may correct our timidity, and  placing us under the magnanimous guidance of the Spirit, enable us to pray  boldly.</p>
