<p><a name="iii.xxix-p1"></A>This assiduity in prayer, though it specially refers to the  peculiar private prayers of individuals, extends also in some measure to the  public prayers of the Church. These, it may be said, cannot be continual, and  ought not to be made, except in the manner which, for the sake of order, has  been established by public consent. This I admit, and hence certain hours are  fixed beforehand, hours which, though indifferent in regard to God, are  necessary for the use of man, that the general convenience may be consulted, and  all things be done in the Church, as Paul enjoins, "decently and in order"  (<a name="iii.xxix-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#040">1 Corinthians 14:40</a><a name="iii.xxix-p1.1"></A>). But there is nothing in this to prevent each church from being now  and then stirred up to a more frequent use of prayer and being more zealously  affected under the impulse of some greater necessity. Of perseverance in prayer,  which is much akin to assiduity, we shall speak towards the close of the chapter  (sec. 51, 52). This assiduity, moreover, is very different from the BATTOLOGIAN  (Greek &#8212; English "yammering"), <i>vain speaking</i>, which our Saviour has  prohibited (<a name="iii.xxix-p1.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#007">Matthew 6:7</a><a name="iii.xxix-p1.2"></A>). For he does not there forbid us to pray long or  frequently, or with great fervour, but warns us against supposing that we can  extort anything from God by importuning him with garrulous loquacity, as if he  were to be persuaded after the manner of men. We know that hypocrites, because  they consider not that they have to do with God, offer up their prayers as  pompously as if it were part of a triumphal show. The Pharisee, who thanked God  that he was not as other men, no doubt proclaimed his praises before men, as if  he had wished to gain a reputation for sanctity by his prayers. Hence that vain  speaking, which for a similar reason prevails so much in the Papacy in the  present day, some vainly spinning out the time by a reiteration of the same  frivolous prayers, and others employing a long series of verbiage for vulgar  display.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A>
 This  childish garrulity being a mockery of God, it is not strange that it is  prohibited in the Church, in order that every feeling there expressed may be  sincere, proceeding from the inmost heart. Akin to this abuse is another which  our Saviour also condemns, namely, when hypocrites for the sake of ostentation  court the presence of many witnesses, and would sooner pray in the market-place  than pray without applause. The true object of prayer being, as we have already  said (sec. 4, 5), to carry our thoughts directly to God, whether to celebrate  his praise or implore his aid, we can easily see that its primary seat is in the  mind and heart, or rather that prayer itself is properly an effusion and  manifestation of internal feeling before Him who is the searcher of hearts.  Hence (as has been said), when our divine Master was pleased to lay down the  best rule for prayer, his injunction was, "Enter into thy closet, and when thou  hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which  seeth in secret shall reward thee openly" (<a name="iii.xxix-p1.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#006">Matthew 6:6</a><a name="iii.xxix-p1.5"></A>). Dissuading us from the  example of hypocrites, who sought the applause of men by an ambitious  ostentation in prayer, he adds the better course &#8212; enter thy chamber, shut thy  door, and there pray. By these words (as I understand them) he taught us to seek  a place of retirement which might enable us to turn all our thoughts inwards and  enter deeply into our hearts, promising that God would hold converse with the  feelings of our mind, of which the body ought to be the temple. He meant not to  deny that it may be expedient to pray in other places also, but he shows that  prayer is somewhat of a secret nature, having its chief seat in the mind, and  requiring a tranquillity far removed from the turmoil of ordinary cares. And  hence it was not without cause that our Lord himself, when he would engage more  earnestly in prayer, withdrew into a retired spot beyond the bustle of the  world, thus reminding us by his example that we are not to neglect those helps  which enable the mind, in itself too much disposed to wander, to become  sincerely intent on prayer. Meanwhile, as he abstained not from prayer when the  occasion required it, though he were in the midst of a crowd, so must we,  whenever there is need, lift up "pure hands" (<a name="iii.xxix-p1.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008">1 Timothy 2:8</a><a name="iii.xxix-p1.6"></A>) at all places. And  hence we must hold that he who declines to pray in the public meeting of the  saints, knows not what it is to pray apart, in retirement, or at home. On the  other hand, he who neglects to pray alone and in private, however sedulously he  frequents public meetings, there gives his prayers to the wind, because he  defers more to the opinion of man than to the secret judgment of God. Still,  lest the public prayers of the Church should be held in contempt, the Lord  anciently bestowed upon them the most honourable appellation, especially when he  called the temple the "<i>house of prayer</i>" (<a name="iii.xxix-p1.7"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007">Isaiah 56:7</a><a name="iii.xxix-p1.7"></A>). For by this  expression he both showed that the duty of prayer is a principal part of his  worship, and that to enable believers to engage in it with one consent his  temple is set up before them as a kind of banner. A noble promise was also  added, "Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be  performed" (<a name="iii.xxix-p1.8"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001">Psalm 65:1</a><a name="iii.xxix-p1.8"></A>).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A>
 By these  words the Psalmist reminds us that the prayers of the Church are never in vain;  because God always furnishes his people with materials for a song of joy. But  although the shadows of the law have ceased, yet because God was pleased by this  ordinance to foster the unity of the faith among us also, there can be no doubt  that the same promise belongs to us &#8212; a promise which Christ sanctioned with  his own lips, and which Paul declares to be perpetually in force.</p>
