<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>Of Prayer</I>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p> <a name="iii.xxxiv"></A> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xxxiv-p0.1"></A>34. </h4> 
<p><a name="iii.xxxiv-p1"></A>We must now attend not only to a surer method, but also form of  prayer, that, namely, which our heavenly Father has delivered to us by his  beloved Son, and in which we may recognize his boundless goodness and  condescension (<a name="iii.xxxiv-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009">Matthew 6:9</a><a name="iii.xxxiv-p1.1"></A>; <a name="iii.xxxiv-p1.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#002">Luke 11:2</a><a name="iii.xxxiv-p1.2"></A>). Besides admonishing and exhorting us to  seek him in our every necessity (as children are wont to betake themselves to  the protection of their parents when oppressed with any anxiety), seeing that we  were not fully aware how great our poverty was, or what was right or for our  interest to ask, he has provided for this ignorance; that wherein our capacity  failed he has sufficiently supplied. For he has given us a form in which is set  before us as in a picture everything which it is lawful to wish, everything  which is conducive to our interest, everything which it is necessary to demand.  From his goodness in this respect we derive the great comfort of knowing, that  as we ask almost in his words, we ask nothing that is absurd, or foreign, or  unseasonable; nothing, in short, that is not agreeable to him. Plato, seeing the  ignorance of men in presenting their desires to God, desires which if granted  would often be most injurious to them, declares the best form of prayer to be  that which an ancient poet has furnished: "O king Jupiter, give what is best,  whether we wish it or wish it not; but avert from us what is evil even though we  ask it" (Plato, Alcibiad. ii). This heathen shows his wisdom in discerning how  dangerous it is to ask of God what our own passion dictates; while, at the same  time, he reminds us of our unhappy condition in not being able to open our lips  before God without dangers unless his Spirit instruct us how to pray aright  (<a name="iii.xxxiv-p1.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026">Romans 8:26</a><a name="iii.xxxiv-p1.3"></A>). The higher value, therefore, ought we to set on the privilege, when  the only begotten Son of God puts words into our lips, and thus relieves our  minds of all hesitation.</p>
