<p><a name="iii.xx-p1"></A>Moreover, the Sophists are guilty of the merest trifling when they  allege that Christ is the Mediator of <i>redemption</i>, but that believers are  mediators of <i>intercession</i>; as if Christ had only performed a temporary  mediation, and left an eternal and imperishable mediation to his servants. Such,  forsooth, is the treatment which he receives from those who pretend only to take  from him a minute portion of honour. Very different is the language of  Scripture, with whose simplicity every pious man will be satisfied, without  paying any regard to those importers. For when John says, "If any man sin, we  have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous" (<a name="iii.xx-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001">1 John 2:1</a><a name="iii.xx-p1.1"></A>), does  he mean merely that we once had an advocate; does he not rather ascribe to him a  perpetual intercession? What does Paul mean when he declares that he "is even at  the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us"? (<a name="iii.xx-p1.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032">Romans 8:32</a><a name="iii.xx-p1.2"></A>). But  when in another passage he declares that he is the only Mediator between God and  man (<a name="iii.xx-p1.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005">1 Timothy 2:5</a><a name="iii.xx-p1.3"></A>), is he not referring to the supplications which he had  mentioned a little before? Having previously said that prayers were to be  offered up for all men, he immediately adds, in confirmation of that statement,  that there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man. Nor does Augustine  give a different interpretation when he says, "Christian men mutually recommend  each other in their prayers. But he for whom none intercedes, while he himself  intercedes for all, is the only true Mediator. Though the Apostle Paul was under  the head a principal member, yet because he was a member of the body of Christ,  and knew that the most true and High Priest of the Church had entered not by  figure into the inner veil to the holy of holies, but by firm and express truth  into the inner sanctuary of heaven to holiness, holiness not imaginary, but  eternal (<a name="iii.xx-p1.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011">Heb. 9:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024">24</a><a name="iii.xx-p1.4"></A>), he also commends himself to the prayers of the faithful  (<a name="iii.xx-p1.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#030">Romans 15:30</a><a name="iii.xx-p1.5"></A>; <a name="iii.xx-p1.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019">Ephesians 6:19</a><a name="iii.xx-p1.6"></A>; <a name="iii.xx-p1.7"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003">Colossians 4:3</a><a name="iii.xx-p1.7"></A>). He does not make himself a mediator between  God and the people, but asks that all the members of the body of Christ should  pray mutually for each other, since the members are mutually sympathetic: if one  member suffers, the others suffer with it (<a name="iii.xx-p1.8"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#026">1 Corinthians 12:26</a><a name="iii.xx-p1.8"></A>). And thus the mutual  prayers of all the members still labouring on the earth ascend to the Head, who  has gone before into heaven, and in whom there is propitiation for our sins. For  if Paul were a mediator, so would also the other apostles, and thus there would  be many mediators, and Paul's statement could not stand, 'There is one God, and  one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;' (<a name="iii.xx-p1.9"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005">1 Timothy 2:5</a><a name="iii.xx-p1.9"></A>) in whom we  also are one (<a name="iii.xx-p1.10"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#005">Romans 12:5</a><a name="iii.xx-p1.10"></A>) if we keep the unity of the faith in the bond of peace  (<a name="iii.xx-p1.11"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003">Ephesians 4:3</a><a name="iii.xx-p1.11"></A>)," (August. Contra Parmenian, Lib. ii. cap. 8). Likewise in another  passage Augustine says, "If thou requirest a priest, he is above the heavens,  where he intercedes for those who on earth died for thee" (August. in <a name="iii.xx-p1.12"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#000">Ps. 94</a><a name="iii.xx-p1.12"></A>).  We imagine not that he throws himself before his Father's knees, and suppliantly  intercedes for us; but we understand with the Apostle, that he appears in the  presence of God, and that the power of his death has the effect of a perpetual  intercession for us; that having entered into the upper sanctuary, he alone  continues to the end of the world to present the prayers of his people, who are  standing far off in the outer court.</p>
