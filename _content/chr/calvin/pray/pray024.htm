<p><a name="iii.xxii-p1"></A>But here stupidity has proceeded to such a length as to give a  manifestation of the genius of superstition, which, when once it has shaken off  the rein, is wont to wanton without limit. After men began to look to the  intercession of saints, a peculiar administration was gradually assigned to  each, so that, according to diversity of business, now one, now another,  intercessor was invoked. Then individuals adopted particular saints, and put  their faith in them, just as if they had been tutelar deities. And thus not only  were gods set up according to the number of the cities (the charge which the  prophet brought against Israel of old, <a name="iii.xxii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#028">Jer. 2:28</a><a name="iii.xxii-p1.1"></A>; 11:13), but according to the  number of individuals. But while the saints in all their desires refer to the  will of God alone, look to it, and acquiesce in it, yet to assign to them any  other prayer than that of longing for the arrival of the kingdom of God, is to  think of them stupidly, carnally, and even insultingly. Nothing can be farther  from such a view than to imagine that each, under the influence of private  feeling, is disposed to be most favourable to his own worshippers. At length  vast numbers have fallen into the horrid blasphemy of invoking them not merely  as helping but presiding over their salvation. See the depth to which miserable  men fall when they forsake their proper station, that is, the word of God. I say  nothing of the more monstrous specimens of impiety in which, though detestable  to God, angels, and men, they themselves feel no pain or shame. Prostrated at a  statue or picture of Barbara or Catherine, and the like, they mutter a <i>Pater  Noster;</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>
 and so far  are their pastors&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A>
  from curing or curbing this frantic course, that, allured by the scent of gain, they  approve and applaud it. But while seeking to relieve themselves of the odium of  this vile and criminal procedure, with what pretext can they defend the practice  of calling upon Eloy (Eligius) or Medard to look upon their servants, and send  them help from heaven, or the Holy Virgin to order her Son to do what they  ask?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A>
  The Council of Carthage forbade direct prayer to be made at the altar to saints.  It is probable that these holy men, unable entirely to suppress the force of  depraved custom, had recourse to this check, that public prayers might not be  vitiated with such forms of expression as <i>Sancte Petre, ora pro nobis &#8212; St  Peter, pray for us.</i> But how much farther has this devilish extravagance  proceeded when men hesitate not to transfer to the dead the peculiar attributes  of Christ and God?</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_8"></A><A HREF="pray024.htm#fr_8">9</A> <a name="iii.xxii-p1.2"></A>Erasmus, though stumbling and walking blindfold in clear  light, ventures to write thus in a letter to Sadolet, 1530: "<a name="iii.xxii-p1.3"></A>Primum, constat  nullum esse locum in divinis voluminibus, qui permittat invocare divos nisi  fortasse detorquere huc placet, quod dives in Evangelica parabola implorat opem  Abrahae. Quanquam autem in re tanta novare quicquam praeter auctoritatem  Scripturae, merito periculosum videri possit, tamen invocationem divorum nusquam  improbo," &c.&#8212;First, it is clear that there is no passage in the Sacred  Volume which permits the invocation of saints, unless we are pleased to wrest to  this purpose what is said in the parable as to the rich man imploring the help  of Abraham. But though in so weighty a matter it may justly seem dangerous to  introduce anything without the authority of Scripture, I by no means condemn the  invocation of saints, &c.</P>
