<span id="iii.xvii-p1"></span>But since no man is worthy to come forward
in his own name, and appear in the presence of God, our heavenly Father,
to relieve us at once from fear and shame, with which all must feel
oppressed, <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7) has given us his Son, Jesus
Christ our Lord, to be our Advocate and Mediator, that under his
guidance we may approach securely, confiding that with him for our
Intercessor nothing which we ask in his name will be denied to us, as
there is nothing which the Father can deny to him (<span
id="iii.xvii-p1.3"></span>[1 Timothy
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005)<span id="iii.xvii-p1.3"></span>;
<span id="iii.xvii-p1.4"></span>[1 John
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001)<span id="iii.xvii-p1.4"></span>;
see sec. 36, 37). To this it is necessary to refer all that we have
previously taught concerning faith; because, as the promise gives us
Christ as our Mediator, so, unless our hope of obtaining what we ask is
founded on him, it deprives us of the privilege of prayer. For it is
impossible to think of the dread majesty of God without being filled
with alarm; and hence the sense of our own unworthiness must keep us far
away, until Christ interpose, and convert a throne of dreadful glory
into a throne of grace, as the Apostle teaches that thus we can "come
boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find
grace to help in time of need" (<span id="iii.xvii-p1.5"></span>[Hebrews
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016)<span id="iii.xvii-p1.5"></span>).
And as a rule has been laid down as to prayer, as a promise has been
given that those who pray will be heard, so we are specially enjoined to
pray in the name of Christ, the promise being that we shall obtain what
we ask in his name. "Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name," says our
Saviour, "that will I do; that the Father may be glorified in the Son;"
" Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name; ask, and ye shall receive,
that your joy may be full" (<span id="iii.xvii-p1.6"></span>[John
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#013)<span id="iii.xvii-p1.6"></span>;
<span id="iii.xvii-p1.7"></span>[John
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#024)<span
id="iii.xvii-p1.7"></span>). Hence it is incontrovertibly clear that
those who pray to God in any other name than that of Christ
contumaciously falsify his orders, and regard his will as nothing, while
they have no promise that they shall obtain. For, as Paul says "All the
promises of God in him are yea, and in him amen;" (<span
id="iii.xvii-p1.8"></span>[2 Corinthians
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020)<span id="iii.xvii-p1.8"></span>),
that is, are confirmed and fulfilled in him.
