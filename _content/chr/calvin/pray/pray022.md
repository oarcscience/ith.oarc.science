*Of Prayer*, by John Calvin, tr. Henry Beveridge \[1845\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

#### <span id="iii.xx-p0.1"></span>20.

<span id="iii.xx-p1"></span>Moreover, the Sophists are guilty of the
merest trifling when they allege that Christ is the Mediator of
*redemption*, but that believers are mediators of *intercession*; as if
Christ had only performed a temporary mediation, and left an eternal and
imperishable mediation to his servants. Such, forsooth, is the treatment
which he receives from those who pretend only to take from him a minute
portion of honour. Very different is the language of Scripture, with
whose simplicity every pious man will be satisfied, without paying any
regard to those importers. For when John says, "If any man sin, we have
an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous" (<span
id="iii.xx-p1.1"></span>[1 John
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001)<span id="iii.xx-p1.1"></span>),
does he mean merely that we once had an advocate; does he not rather
ascribe to him a perpetual intercession? What does Paul mean when he
declares that he "is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh
intercession for us"? (<span id="iii.xx-p1.2"></span>[Romans
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032)<span id="iii.xx-p1.2"></span>).
But when in another passage he declares that he is the only Mediator
between God and man (<span id="iii.xx-p1.3"></span>[1 Timothy
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005)<span id="iii.xx-p1.3"></span>), is
he not referring to the supplications which he had mentioned a little
before? Having previously said that prayers were to be offered up for
all men, he immediately adds, in confirmation of that statement, that
there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man. Nor does
Augustine give a different interpretation when he says, "Christian men
mutually recommend each other in their prayers. But he for whom none
intercedes, while he himself intercedes for all, is the only true
Mediator. Though the Apostle Paul was under the head a principal member,
yet because he was a member of the body of Christ, and knew that the
most true and High Priest of the Church had entered not by figure into
the inner veil to the holy of holies, but by firm and express truth into
the inner sanctuary of heaven to holiness, holiness not imaginary, but
eternal (<span id="iii.xx-p1.4"></span>[Heb.
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024)<span id="iii.xx-p1.4"></span>), he
also commends himself to the prayers of the faithful (<span
id="iii.xx-p1.5"></span>[Romans
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#030)<span id="iii.xx-p1.5"></span>;
<span id="iii.xx-p1.6"></span>[Ephesians
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019)<span id="iii.xx-p1.6"></span>;
<span id="iii.xx-p1.7"></span>[Colossians
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003)<span id="iii.xx-p1.7"></span>). He
does not make himself a mediator between God and the people, but asks
that all the members of the body of Christ should pray mutually for each
other, since the members are mutually sympathetic: if one member
suffers, the others suffer with it (<span id="iii.xx-p1.8"></span>[1
Corinthians 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#026)<span
id="iii.xx-p1.8"></span>). And thus the mutual prayers of all the
members still labouring on the earth ascend to the Head, who has gone
before into heaven, and in whom there is propitiation for our sins. For
if Paul were a mediator, so would also the other apostles, and thus
there would be many mediators, and Paul's statement could not stand,
'There is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ
Jesus;' (<span id="iii.xx-p1.9"></span>[1 Timothy
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005)<span id="iii.xx-p1.9"></span>) in
whom we also are one (<span id="iii.xx-p1.10"></span>[Romans
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#005)<span id="iii.xx-p1.10"></span>)
if we keep the unity of the faith in the bond of peace (<span
id="iii.xx-p1.11"></span>[Ephesians
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003)<span id="iii.xx-p1.11"></span>),"
(August. Contra Parmenian, Lib. ii. cap. 8). Likewise in another passage
Augustine says, "If thou requirest a priest, he is above the heavens,
where he intercedes for those who on earth died for thee" (August. in
<span id="iii.xx-p1.12"></span>[Ps.
94](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#000)<span id="iii.xx-p1.12"></span>). We
imagine not that he throws himself before his Father's knees, and
suppliantly intercedes for us; but we understand with the Apostle, that
he appears in the presence of God, and that the power of his death has
the effect of a perpetual intercession for us; that having entered into
the upper sanctuary, he alone continues to the end of the world to
present the prayers of his people, who are standing far off in the outer
court.
