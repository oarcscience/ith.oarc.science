<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>Of Prayer</I>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p> <a name="iii.xliv"></A> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xliv-p0.1"></A>44. </h4> 
<p><a name="iii.xliv-p1"></A>Now comes the second part of the prayer, in which we descend to our  own interests, not, indeed, that we are to lose sight of the glory of God (to  which, as Paul declares, we must have respect even in meat and drink, <a name="iii.xliv-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031">1 Cor. 10:31</a><a name="iii.xliv-p1.1"></A>), and ask only what is expedient for ourselves; but the distinction, as we  have already observed, is this: God claiming the three first petitions as  specially his own, carries us entirely to himself, that in this way he may prove  our piety. Next he permits us to look to our own advantage, but still on the  condition, that when we ask anything for ourselves it must be in order that all  the benefits which he confers may show forth his glory, there being nothing more  incumbent on us than to live and die to him.</p> 
<p class="noindent"><a name="iii.xliv-p2"></A>By the first petition of the second part, GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD,  we pray in general that God would give us all things which the body requires in  this sublunary state, not only food and clothing, but everything which he knows  will assist us to eat our bread in peace. In this way we briefly cast our care  upon him, and commit ourselves to his providence, that he may feed, foster, and  preserve us. For our heavenly Father disdains not to take our body under his  charge and protection, that he may exercise our faith in those minute matters,  while we look to him for everything, even to a morsel of bread and a drop of  water. For since, owing to some strange inequality, we feel more concern for the  body than for the soul, many who can trust the latter to God still continue  anxious about the former, still hesitate as to what they are to eat, as to how  they are to be clothed, and are in trepidation whenever their hands are not  filled with corn, and wine, and oil (<a name="iii.xliv-p2.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#008">Psalm 4:8</a><a name="iii.xliv-p2.1"></A>): so much more value do we set on  this shadowy, fleeting life, than on a blessed immortality. But those who,  trusting to God, have once cast away that anxiety about the flesh, immediately  look to him for greater gifts, even salvation and eternal life. It is no slight  exercise of faith, therefore, to hope in God for things which would otherwise  give us so much concern; nor have we made little progress when we get quit of  this unbelief, which cleaves, as it were, to our very bones.</p> 
<p class="noindent"><a name="iii.xliv-p3"></A>The speculations of some concerning supersubstantial bread seem to be very  little accordant with our Saviour's meaning; for our prayer would be defective  were we not to ascribe to God the nourishment even of this fading life. The  reason which they give is heathenish, viz., that it is inconsistent with the  character of sons of God, who ought to be spiritual, not only to occupy their  mind with earthly cares, but to suppose God also occupied with them. As if his  blessing and paternal favour were not eminently displayed in giving us food, or  as if there were nothing in the declaration that godliness hath "the promise of  the life that now is, and of that which is to come" (<a name="iii.xliv-p3.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008">1 Timothy 4:8</a><a name="iii.xliv-p3.1"></A>). But although  the forgiveness of sins is of far more importance than the nourishment of the  body, yet Christ has set down the inferior in the prior place, in order that he  might gradually raise us to the other two petitions, which properly belong to  the heavenly life, &#8212; in this providing for our sluggishness. We are enjoined to  ask <i>our bread</i>, that we may be contented with the measure which our  heavenly Father is pleased to dispense, and not strive to make gain by illicit  arts. Meanwhile, we must hold that the title by which it is ours is donation,  because, as Moses says (<a name="iii.xliv-p3.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#020">Leviticus 26:20</a><a name="iii.xliv-p3.2"></A>, <a name="iii.xliv-p3.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#017">Deuteronomy 8:17</a><a name="iii.xliv-p3.3"></A>), neither our industry, nor  labour, nor hands, acquire anything for us, unless the blessing of God be  present; nay, not even would abundance of bread be of the least avail were it   not divinely converted into nourishment. And hence this liberality of God is not  less necessary to the rich than the poor, because, though their cellars and  barns were full, they would be parched and pine with want did they not enjoy his  favour along with their bread. The terms <i>this day</i>, or, as it is in  another Evangelist, <i>daily</i>, and also the epithet <i>daily</i>, lay a  restraint on our immoderate desire of fleeting good &#8212; a desire which we are  extremely apt to indulge to excess, and from which other evils ensue: for when  our supply is in richer abundance we ambitiously squander it in pleasure,  luxury, ostentation, or other kinds of extravagance. Wherefore, we are only  enjoined to ask as much as our necessity requires, and as it were for each day,  confiding that our heavenly Father, who gives us the supply of to-day, will not  fail us on the morrow. How great soever our abundance may be, however well  filled our cellars and granaries, we must still always ask for daily bread, for  we must feel assured that all substance is nothing, unless in so far as the  Lord, by pouring out his blessing, make it fruitful during its whole progress;  for even that which is in our hand is not ours except in so far as he every hour  portions it out, and permits us to use it. As nothing is more difficult to human  pride than the admission of this truth, the Lord declares that he gave a special  proof for all ages, when he fed his people with manna in the desert (<a name="iii.xliv-p3.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003">Deuteronomy 8:3</a><a name="iii.xliv-p3.4"></A>),  that he might remind us that "man shall not live by bread alone, but by every  word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (<a name="iii.xliv-p3.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004">Matthew 4:4</a><a name="iii.xliv-p3.5"></A>). It is thus  intimated, that by his power alone our life and strength are sustained, though  he ministers supply to us by bodily instruments. In like manner, whenever it so  pleases, he gives us a proof of an opposite description, by breaking the  strength, or, as he himself calls it, the <i>staff</i> of bread (<a name="iii.xliv-p3.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026">Leviticus 26:26</a><a name="iii.xliv-p3.6"></A>),  and leaving us even while eating to pine with hunger, and while drinking to be  parched with thirst. Those who, not contented with daily bread, indulge an  unrestrained insatiable cupidity, or those who are full of their own abundance,  and trust in their own riches, only mock God by offering up this prayer. For the  former ask what they would be unwilling to obtain, nay, what they most of all  abominate, namely, daily bread only, and as much as in them lies disguise their  avarice from God, whereas true prayer should pour out the whole soul and every  inward feeling before him. The latter, again, ask what they do not at all expect  to obtain, namely, what they imagine that they in themselves already possess. In  its being called <i>ours</i>, God, as we have already said, gives a striking  display of his kindness, making that to be ours to which we have no just claim.  Nor must we reject the view to which I have already adverted, viz., that this  name is given to what is obtained by just and honest labour, as contrasted with  what is obtained by fraud and rapine, nothing being our own which we obtain with  injury to others. When we ask God to <i>give us</i>, the meaning is, that the  thing asked is simply and freely the gift of God, whatever be the quarter from  which it comes to us, even when it seems to have been specially prepared by our  own art and industry, and procured by our hands, since it is to his blessing  alone that all our labours owe their success.</p>
