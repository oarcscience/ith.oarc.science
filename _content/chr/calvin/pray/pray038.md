#### <span id="iii.xxxvi-p0.1"></span>36.

<span id="iii.xxxvi-p1"></span>The first thing suggested at the very
outset is, as we have already said (sec. 17-19), that all our prayers to
God ought only to be presented in the name of Christ, as there is no
other name which can recommend them. In calling God our Father, we
certainly plead the name of Christ. For with what confidence could any
man call God his Father? Who would have the presumption to arrogate to
himself the honour of a son of God were we not gratuitously adopted as
his sons in Christ? He being the true Son, has been given to us as a
brother, so that that which he possesses as his own by nature becomes
ours by adoption, if we embrace this great mercy with firm faith. As
John says, "As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
sons of God, even to them that believe in his name" (<span
id="iii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>[John
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012)<span
id="iii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>). Hence he both calls himself our Father,
and is pleased to be so called by us, by this delightful name relieving
us of all distrust, since nowhere can a stronger affection be found than
in a father. Hence, too, he could not have given us a stronger testimony
of his boundless love than in calling us his sons. But his love towards
us is so much the greater and more excellent than that of earthly
parents, the farther he surpasses all men in goodness and mercy (<span
id="iii.xxxvi-p1.2"></span>[Isaiah
63:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#016)<span
id="iii.xxxvi-p1.2"></span>). Earthly parents, laying aside all paternal
affection, might abandon their offspring; he will never abandon us
(<span id="iii.xxxvi-p1.3"></span>[Psalm
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010)<span
id="iii.xxxvi-p1.3"></span>), seeing he cannot deny himself. For we have
his promise, "If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto
your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give
good things to them that ask him?" (<span
id="iii.xxxvi-p1.4"></span>[Matthew
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#011)<span
id="iii.xxxvi-p1.4"></span>). In like manner in the prophet, "Can a
woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on
the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will not I forget thee"
(<span id="iii.xxxvi-p1.5"></span>[Isaiah
49:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#015)<span
id="iii.xxxvi-p1.5"></span>). But if we are his sons, then as a son
cannot betake himself to the protection of a stranger and a foreigner
without at the same time complaining of his father's cruelty or poverty,
so we cannot ask assistance from any other quarter than from him, unless
we would upbraid him with poverty, or want of means, or cruelty and
excessive austerity.
