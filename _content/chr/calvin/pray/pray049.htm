<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>Of Prayer</I>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p> <a name="iii.xlvii"></A> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xlvii-p0.1"></A>47. </h4> 
<p><a name="iii.xlvii-p1"></A>These three petitions, in which we specially commend ourselves and  all that we have to God, clearly show what we formerly observed (sec. 38, 39),  that the prayers of Christians should be public, and have respect to the public  edification of the Church and the advancement of believers in spiritual  communion. For no one requests that anything should be given to him as an  individual, but we all ask in common for daily bread and the forgiveness of  sins, not to be led into temptation, but delivered from evil. Moreover, there is  subjoined the reason for our great boldness in asking and confidence of  obtaining (sec. 11, 36). Although this does not exist in the Latin copies, yet  as it accords so well with the whole, we cannot think of omitting it.</p> 
<p class="noindent"><a name="iii.xlvii-p2"></A>The words are, THINE IS THE KINGDOM, AND THE POWER, AND THE GLORY, FOR EVER.  Here is the calm and firm assurance of our faith. For were our prayers to be  commended to God by our own worth, who would venture even to whisper before him?  Now, however wretched we may be, however unworthy, however devoid of  commendation, we shall never want a reason for prayer, nor a ground of  confidence, since the kingdom, power, and glory, can never be wrested from our  Father. The last word is AMEN, by which is expressed the eagerness of our desire  to obtain the things which we ask, while our hope is confirmed, that all things  have already been obtained and will assuredly be granted to us, seeing they have  been promised by God, who cannot deceive. This accords with the form of  expression to which we have already adverted: "Grant, O Lord, for thy name's  sake, not on account of us or of our righteousness." By this the saints not only  express the end of their prayers, but confess that they are unworthy of  obtaining did not God find the cause in himself and were not their confidence  founded entirely on his nature.</p>
