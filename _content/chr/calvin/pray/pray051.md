*Of Prayer*, by John Calvin, tr. Henry Beveridge \[1845\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

<span id="iii.xlix-p1"></span>By this, however, we would not have it
understood that we are so restricted to this form of prayer as to make
it unlawful to change a word or syllable of it. For in Scripture we meet
with many prayers differing greatly from it in word, yet written by the
same Spirit, and capable of being used by us with the greatest
advantage. Many prayers also are continually suggested to believers by
the same Spirit, though in expression they bear no great resemblance to
it. All we mean to say is, that no man should wish, expect, or ask
anything which is not summarily comprehended in this prayer. Though the
words may be very different, there must be no difference in the sense.
In this way, all prayers, both those which are contained in the
Scripture, and those which come forth from pious breasts, must be
referred to it, certainly none can ever equal it, far less surpass it in
perfection. It omits nothing which we can conceive in praise of God,
nothing which we can imagine advantageous to man, and the whole is so
exact that all hope of improving it may well be renounced. In short, let
us remember that we have here the doctrine of heavenly wisdom. God has
taught what he willed; he willed what was necessary.
