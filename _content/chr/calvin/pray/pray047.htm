<p><a name="iii.xlv-p1"></A>The next petition is, FORGIVE ITS OUR DEBTS. In this and the  following petition our Saviour has briefly comprehended whatever is conducive to  the heavenly life, as these two members contain the spiritual covenant which God  made for the salvation of his Church, "I will put my law in their inward parts,  and write it on their hearts." "I will pardon all their iniquities" (<a name="iii.xlv-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033">Jeremiah 31:33</a><a name="iii.xlv-p1.1"></A>;  <a name="iii.xlv-p1.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#008">Jeremiah 33:8</a><a name="iii.xlv-p1.2"></A>). Here our Saviour begins with the forgiveness of sins, and then adds the  subsequent blessing, viz., that God would protect us by the power, and support  us by the aid of his Spirit, so that we may stand invincible against all  temptations. To sins he gives the name of <i>debts</i>, because we owe the  punishment due to them, a debt which we could not possibly pay were we not  discharged by this remission, the result of his free mercy, when he freely  expunges the debt, accepting nothing in return; but of his own mercy receiving  satisfaction in Christ, who gave himself a ransom for us (<a name="iii.xlv-p1.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024">Romans 3:24</a><a name="iii.xlv-p1.3"></A>). Hence,  those who expect to satisfy God by merits of their own or of others, or to  compensate and purchase forgiveness by means of satisfactions, have no share in  this free pardon, and while they address God in this petition, do nothing more  than subscribe their own accusation, and seal their condemnation by their own  testimony. For they confess that they are debtors, unless they are discharged by  means of forgiveness. This forgiveness, however, they do not receive, but rather  reject, when they obtrude their merits and satisfactions upon God, since by so  doing they do not implore his mercy, but appeal to his justice. Let those,  again, who dream of a perfection which makes it unnecessary to seek pardon, find  their disciples among those whose itching ears incline them to imposture,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A>
 (see  Calv. on <a name="iii.xlv-p1.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020">Daniel 9:20</a><a name="iii.xlv-p1.6"></A>); only let them understand that those whom they thus acquire  have been carried away from Christ, since he, by instructing all to confess  their guilt, receives none but sinners, not that he may soothe, and so encourage  them in their sins, but because he knows that believers are never so divested of  the sins of the flesh as not to remain subject to the justice of God. It is,  indeed, to be wished, it ought even to be our strenuous endeavour, to perform  all the parts of our duty, so as truly to congratulate ourselves before God as  being pure from every stain; but as God is pleased to renew his image in us by  degrees, so that to some extent there is always a residue of corruption in our  flesh, we ought by no means to neglect the remedy. But if Christ, according to  the authority given him by his Father, enjoins us, during the whole course of  our lives, to implore pardon, who can tolerate those new teachers who, by the  phantom of perfect innocence, endeavour to dazzle the simple, and make them  believe that they can render themselves completely free from guilt? This, as  John declares, is nothing else than to make God a liar (<a name="iii.xlv-p1.7"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#010">1 John 1:10</a><a name="iii.xlv-p1.7"></A>). In like  manner, those foolish men mutilate the covenant in which we have seen that our  salvation is contained by concealing one head of it, and so destroying it  entirely; being guilty not only of profanity in that they separate things which  ought to be indissolubly connected; but also of wickedness and cruelty in  overwhelming wretched souls with despair &#8212; of treachery also to themselves and  their followers, in that they encourage themselves in a carelessness  diametrically opposed to the mercy of God. It is excessively childish to object,  that when they long for the advent of the kingdom of God, they at the same time  pray for the abolition of sin. In the former division of the prayer absolute  perfection is set before us; but in the latter our own weakness. Thus the two  fitly correspond to each other &#8212; we strive for the goal, and at the same time  neglect not the remedies which our necessities require.</p> 
<p class="noindent"><a name="iii.xlv-p2"></A>In the next part of the petition we pray to be forgiven, "<i>as we forgive  our debtors;</i>" that is, as we spare and pardon all by whom we are in any way  offended, either in deed by unjust, or in word by contumelious treatment. Not  that we can forgive the guilt of a fault or offence; this belongs to God only;  but we can forgive to this extent: we can voluntarily divest our minds of wrath,  hatred, and revenge, and efface the remembrance of injuries by a voluntary  oblivion. Wherefore, we are not to ask the forgiveness of our sins from God,  unless we forgive the offenses of all who are or have been injurious to us. If  we retain any hatred in our minds, if we meditate revenge, and devise the means  of hurting; nay, if we do not return to a good understanding with our enemies,  perform every kind of friendly office, and endeavour to effect a reconciliation  with them, we by this petition beseech God not to grant us forgiveness. For we  ask him to do to us as we do to others. This is the same as asking him not to do  unless we do also. What, then, do such persons obtain by this petition but a  heavier judgment? Lastly, it is to be observed that the condition of being  forgiven as we forgive our debtors, is not added because by forgiving others we  deserve forgiveness, as if the cause of forgiveness were expressed; but by the  use of this expression the Lord has been pleased partly to solace the weakness  of our faith, using it as a sign to assure us that our sins are as certainly  forgiven as we are certainly conscious of having forgiven others, when our mind  is completely purged from all envy, hatred, and malice; and partly using as a  badge by which he excludes from the number of his children all who, prone to  revenge and reluctant to forgive, obstinately keep up their enmity, cherishing  against others that indignation which they deprecate from themselves; so that  they should not venture to invoke him as a Father. In the Gospel of Luke, we  have this distinctly stated in the words of Christ.</p>
