<p><a name="iii.xxxvi-p1"></A>The first thing suggested at the very outset is, as we have already  said (sec. 17-19), that all our prayers to God ought only to be presented in the  name of Christ, as there is no other name which can recommend them. In calling  God our Father, we certainly plead the name of Christ. For with what confidence  could any man call God his Father? Who would have the presumption to arrogate to  himself the honour of a son of God were we not gratuitously adopted as his sons  in Christ? He being the true Son, has been given to us as a brother, so that  that which he possesses as his own by nature becomes ours by adoption, if we  embrace this great mercy with firm faith. As John says, "As many as received  him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe  in his name" (<a name="iii.xxxvi-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012">John 1:12</a><a name="iii.xxxvi-p1.1"></A>). Hence he both calls himself our Father, and is pleased  to be so called by us, by this delightful name relieving us of all distrust,  since nowhere can a stronger affection be found than in a father. Hence, too, he  could not have given us a stronger testimony of his boundless love than in  calling us his sons. But his love towards us is so much the greater and more  excellent than that of earthly parents, the farther he surpasses all men in  goodness and mercy (<a name="iii.xxxvi-p1.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#016">Isaiah 63:16</a><a name="iii.xxxvi-p1.2"></A>). Earthly parents, laying aside all paternal  affection, might abandon their offspring; he will never abandon us (<a name="iii.xxxvi-p1.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010">Psalm 27:10</a><a name="iii.xxxvi-p1.3"></A>),  seeing he cannot deny himself. For we have his promise, "If ye then, being evil,  know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father  which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?" (<a name="iii.xxxvi-p1.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#011">Matthew 7:11</a><a name="iii.xxxvi-p1.4"></A>). In  like manner in the prophet, "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she  should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet  will not I forget thee" (<a name="iii.xxxvi-p1.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#015">Isaiah 49:15</a><a name="iii.xxxvi-p1.5"></A>). But if we are his sons, then as a son  cannot betake himself to the protection of a stranger and a foreigner without at  the same time complaining of his father's cruelty or poverty, so we cannot ask  assistance from any other quarter than from him, unless we would upbraid him  with poverty, or want of means, or cruelty and excessive austerity.</p>
