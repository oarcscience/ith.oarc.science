<p><a name="iii.xxxv-p1"></A>This form or rule of prayer is composed of <i>six petitions</i>.  For I am prevented from agreeing with those who divide it into <i>seven</i> by  the adversative mode of diction used by the Evangelist, who appears to have  intended to unite the two members together; as if he had said, Do not allow us  to be overcome by temptation, but rather bring assistance to our frailty, and  deliver us that we may not fall. Ancient writers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A>
 also  agree with us, that what is added by Matthew as a seventh head is to be  considered as explanatory of the sixth petition.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A>
 But  though in every part of the prayer the first place is assigned to the glory of  God, still this is more especially the object of the three first petitions, in  which we are to look to the glory of God alone, without any reference to what is  called our own advantage. The three remaining petitions are devoted to our  interest, and properly relate to things which it is useful for us to ask. When  we ask that the name of God may be hallowed, as God wishes to prove whether we  love and serve him freely, or from the hope of reward, we are not to think at  all of our own interest; we must set his glory before our eyes, and keep them  intent upon it alone. In the other similar petitions, this is the only manner in  which we ought to be affected. It is true, that in this way our own interest is  greatly promoted, because, when the name of God is hallowed in the way we ask,  our own sanctification also is thereby promoted. But in regard to this  advantage, we must, as I have said, shut our eyes, and be in a manner blind, so  as not even to see it; and hence were all hope of our private advantage cut off,  we still should never cease to wish and pray for this hallowing, and everything  else which pertains to the glory of God. We have examples in Moses and Paul, who  did not count it grievous to turn away their eyes and minds from themselves, and  with intense and fervent zeal long for death, if by their loss the kingdom and  glory of God might be promoted (<a name="iii.xxxv-p1.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032">Exodus 32:32</a><a name="iii.xxxv-p1.4"></A>;  <a name="iii.xxxv-p1.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003">Romans 9:3</a><a name="iii.xxxv-p1.5"></A>). On the other hand, when  we ask for daily bread, although we desire what is advantageous for ourselves,  we ought also especially to seek the glory of God, so much so that we would not  ask at all unless it were to turn to his glory. Let us now proceed to an  exposition of the Prayer.</p>

Matthieu, et qu&#8217;aucuns ont pris pour une septieme requeste, n&#8217;est qu&#8217;un  explication de la sixieme, et se doit a icelle rapporter;"&#8212;Whence it is easy  to perceive that what is added in St Matthew, and which some have taken for a  seventh petition, is only an explanation of the sixth, and ought to be referred  to it.</P>
