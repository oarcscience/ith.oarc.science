<p><a name="iii.xl-p1"></A>The next words are, WHICH ART IN HEAVEN. From this we are not to  infer that he is enclosed and confined within the circumference of heaven, as by  a kind of boundaries. Hence Solomon confesses, "The heaven of heavens cannot  contain thee" (<a name="iii.xl-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027">1 Kings 8:27</a><a name="iii.xl-p1.1"></A>); and he himself says by the Prophet, "The heaven is  my throne, and the earth is my footstool" (<a name="iii.xl-p1.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001">Isaiah 56:1</a><a name="iii.xl-p1.2"></A>); thereby intimating, that  his presence, not confined to any region, is diffused over all space. But as our  gross minds are unable to conceive of his ineffable glory, it is designated to  us by <i>heaven</i>, nothing which our eyes can behold being so full of  splendour and majesty. While, then, we are accustomed to regard every object as  confined to the place where our senses discern it, no place can be assigned to  God; and hence, if we would seek him, we must rise higher than all corporeal or  mental discernment. Again, this form of expression reminds us that he is far  beyond the reach of change or corruption, that he holds the whole universe in  his grasp, and rules it by his power. The effect of the expressions therefore,  is the same as if it had been said, that he is of infinite majesty,  incomprehensible essence, boundless power, and eternal duration. When we thus  speak of God, our thoughts must be raised to their highest pitch; we must not  ascribe to him anything of a terrestrial or carnal nature, must not measure him  by our little standards, or suppose his will to be like ours. At the same time,  we must put our confidence in him, understanding that heaven and earth are  governed by his providence and power. In short, under the name of Father is set  before us that God, who hath appeared to us in his own image, that we may invoke  him with sure faith; the familiar name of Father being given not only to inspire  confidence, but also to curb our minds, and prevent them from going astray after  doubtful or fictitious gods. We thus ascend from the only begotten Son to the  supreme Father of angels and of the Church. Then when his throne is fixed in  heaven, we are reminded that he governs the world, and, therefore, that it is  not in vain to approach him whose present care we actually experience. "He that  cometh to God," says the Apostle, "must believe that he is, and that he is a  rewarder of them that diligently seek him" (<a name="iii.xl-p1.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006">Hebrews 11:6</a><a name="iii.xl-p1.3"></A>). Here Christ makes both  claims for his Father, <i>first</i>, that we place our faith in him; and,  <i>secondly</i>, that we feel assured that our salvation is not neglected by  him, inasmuch as he condescends to extend his providence to us. By these  elementary principles Paul prepares us to pray aright; for before enjoining us  to make our requests known unto God, he premises in this way, "The Lord is at  hand. Be careful for nothing" (<a name="iii.xl-p1.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#005">Phil. 4:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006">6</a><a name="iii.xl-p1.4"></A>). Whence it appears that doubt and  perplexity hang over the prayers of those in whose minds the belief is not  firmly seated, that "the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous" (<a name="iii.xl-p1.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015">Psalm 34:15</a><a name="iii.xl-p1.5"></A>).</p>
