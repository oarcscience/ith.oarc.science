<p><a name="iii.xxviii-p1"></A>But though prayer is properly confined to vows and supplications,  yet so strong is the affinity between petition and thanksgiving, that both may  be conveniently comprehended under one name. For the forms which Paul enumerates  (<a name="iii.xxviii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001">1 Timothy 2:1</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p1.1"></A>) fall under the first member of this division. By prayer and  supplication we pour out our desires before God, asking as well those things  which tend to promote his glory and display his name, as the benefits which  contribute to our advantage. By thanksgiving we duly celebrate his kindnesses  toward us, ascribing to his liberality every blessing which enters into our lot.  David accordingly includes both in one sentence, "Call upon me in the day of  trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me" (<a name="iii.xxviii-p1.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#015">Psalm 50:15</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p1.2"></A>). Scripture,  not without reason, commands us to use both continually. We have already  described the greatness of our want, while experience itself proclaims the  straits which press us on every side to be so numerous and so great, that all  have sufficient ground to send forth sighs and groans to God without  intermission, and suppliantly implore him. For even should they be exempt from  adversity, still the holiest ought to be stimulated first by their sins, and,  secondly, by the innumerable assaults of temptation, to long for a remedy. The  sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving can never be interrupted without guilt,  since God never ceases to load us with favour upon favour, so as to force us to  gratitude, however slow and sluggish we may be. In short, so great and widely  diffused are the riches of his liberality towards us, so marvellous and wondrous  the miracles which we behold on every side, that we never can want a subject and  materials for praise and thanksgiving.</p> 
<p class="noindent"><a name="iii.xxviii-p2"></A>To make this somewhat clearer: since all our hopes and resources are placed  in God (this has already been fully proved), so that neither our persons nor our  interests can prosper without his blessing, we must constantly submit ourselves  and our all to him. Then whatever we deliberate, speak, or do, should be  deliberated, spoken, and done under his hand and will; in fine, under the hope  of his assistance. God has pronounced a curse upon all who, confiding in  themselves or others, form plans and resolutions, who, without regarding his  will, or invoking his aid, either plan or attempt to execute (<a name="iii.xxviii-p2.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#014">James 4:14</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.1"></A>;  <a name="iii.xxviii-p2.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001">Isaiah 30:1</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.2"></A>; <a name="iii.xxviii-p2.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001">31:1</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.3"></A>). And since, as has already been observed, he receives the honour  which is due when he is acknowledged to be the author of all good, it follows  that, in deriving all good from his hand, we ought continually to express our  thankfulness, and that we have no right to use the benefits which proceed from  his liberality, if we do not assiduously proclaim his praise, and give him  thanks, these being the ends for which they are given. When Paul declares that  every creature of God "is sanctified by the word of God and prayers"  (<a name="iii.xxviii-p2.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005">1 Timothy 4:5</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.4"></A>), he intimates that without the word and prayers none of them are holy and  pure, <i>word</i> being used metonymically for <i>faith</i>. Hence David, on  experiencing the loving-kindness of the Lord, elegantly declares, "He hath put a  new song in my mouth" (<a name="iii.xxviii-p2.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003">Psalm 40:3</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.5"></A>); intimating, that our silence is malignant when  we leave his blessings unpraised, seeing every blessing he bestows is a new  ground of thanksgiving. Thus Isaiah, proclaiming the singular mercies of God,  says, "Sing unto the Lord a new song" (<a name="iii.xxviii-p2.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#010">Isaiah 42:10</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.6"></A>). In the same sense David says  in another passage, "O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall show forth  thy praise" (<a name="iii.xxviii-p2.7"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#015">Psalm 41:15</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.7"></A>). In like manner, Hezekiah and Jonah declare that they  will regard it as the end of their deliverance "to celebrate the goodness of God  with songs in his temple" (<a name="iii.xxviii-p2.8"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#020">Isaiah 38:20</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.8"></A>; <a name="iii.xxviii-p2.9"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#010">Jonah 2:10</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.9"></A>). David lays down a general  rule for all believers in these words, "What shall I render unto the Lord for  all his benefits toward me? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the  name of the Lord" (<a name="iii.xxviii-p2.10"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#012">Ps. 116:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#013">13</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.10"></A>). This rule the Church follows in another  psalm, "Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give  thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise" (<a name="iii.xxviii-p2.11"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047">Psalm 106:47</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.11"></A>). Again,  " He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. This  shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be  created shall praise the Lord." "To declare the name of the Lord in Zion, and  his praise in Jerusalem" (<a name="iii.xxviii-p2.12"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018">Ps. 102:18</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#021">21</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.12"></A>). Nay, whenever believers beseech the  Lord to do anything <i>for his own name's sake</i>, as they declare themselves  unworthy of obtaining it in their own name, so they oblige themselves to give  thanks, and promise to make the right use of his lovingkindness by being the  heralds of it. Thus Hosea, speaking of the future redemption of the Church,  says, "Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously; so will we render the  calves of our lips" (<a name="iii.xxviii-p2.13"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002">Hosea 14:2</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.13"></A>). Not only do our tongues proclaim the kindness  of God, but they naturally inspire us with love to him. "I love the Lord,  because he hath heard my voice and my supplications" (<a name="iii.xxviii-p2.14"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#001">Psalm 116:1</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.14"></A>). In another  passage, speaking of the help which he had experienced, he says, "I will love  thee, O Lord, my strength" (<a name="iii.xxviii-p2.15"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001">Psalm 18:1</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.15"></A>). No praise will ever please God that does  not flow from this feeling of love. Nay, we must attend to the declaration of  Paul, that all wishes are vicious and perverse which are not accompanied with  thanksgiving. His words are, "In everything by prayer and supplication with  thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God" (<a name="iii.xxviii-p2.16"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006">Philippians 4:6</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.16"></A>). Because  many, under the influence of moroseness, weariness, impatience, bitter grief and  fear, use murmuring in their prayers, he enjoins us so to regulate our feelings  as cheerfully to bless God even before obtaining what we ask. But if this  connection ought always to subsist in full vigour between things that are almost  contrary, the more sacred is the tie which binds us to celebrate the praises of  God whenever he grants our requests. And as we have already shown that our  prayers, which otherwise would be polluted, are sanctified by the intercession  of Christ, so the Apostle, by enjoining us "to offer the sacrifice of praise to  God continually" by Christ (<a name="iii.xxviii-p2.17"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015">Hebrews 13:15</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.17"></A>), reminds us, that without the  intervention of his priesthood our lips are not pure enough to celebrate the  name of God. Hence we infer that a monstrous delusion prevails among Papists,  the great majority of whom wonder when Christ is called an intercessor. The  reason why Paul enjoins, "Pray without ceasing; in everything give thanks"  (<a name="iii.xxviii-p2.18"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#017">1 Thess. 5:17</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018">18</a><a name="iii.xxviii-p2.18"></A>), is, because he would have us with the utmost assiduity, at all  times, in every place, in all things, and under all circumstances, direct our  prayers to God, to expect all the things which we desire from him, and when  obtained ascribe them to him; thus furnishing perpetual grounds for prayer and  praise.</p>
