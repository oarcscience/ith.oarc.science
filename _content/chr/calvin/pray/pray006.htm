<p><a name="iii.iv-p1"></A>Let the first rule of right prayer then be, to have our heart and  mind framed as becomes those who are entering into converse with God. This we  shall accomplish in regard to the mind, if, laying aside carnal thoughts and  cares which might interfere with the direct and pure contemplation of God, it  not only be wholly intent on prayer, but also, as far as possible, be borne and  raised above itself. I do not here insist on a mind so disengaged as to feel  none of the gnawings of anxiety; on the contrary, it is by much anxiety that the  fervour of prayer is inflamed. Thus we see that the holy servants of God betray  great anguish, not to say solicitude, when they cause the voice of complaint to  ascend to the Lord from the deep abyss and the jaws of death. What I say is,  that all foreign and extraneous cares must be dispelled by which the mind might  be driven to and fro in vague suspense, be drawn down from heaven, and kept  grovelling on the earth. When I say it must be raised above itself, I mean that  it must not bring into the presence of God any of those things which our blind  and stupid reason is wont to devise, nor keep itself confined within the little  measure of its own vanity, but rise to a purity worthy of God.</p>
