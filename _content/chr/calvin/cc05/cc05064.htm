<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p38"></A><b>21.</b> And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it <i>was</i> a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savor, <i>and</i> an offering made by fire unto the Lord; as the Lord commanded Moses.</p>

<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p48"></A><b>26.</b> And out of the basket of unleavened bread that <i>was</i> before the Lord he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put <i>them</i> on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p49"></A><b>26.</b> De canistro quoque infermentatorum quae erant coram Jehova, tulit tortam infermentatam unam, et tortam panis oleati unam, et laganum unum, posuitque cum adipe et cum armo dextro.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p50"></A><a name="vii.v-p50.1"></A>27. And he put all upon Aaron&#8217;s hands, and upon his sons&#8217; hands, and waved them. <i>for</i> a wave-offering before the Lord.</p>

<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p52"></A><b>28.</b> And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt <i>them</i> <i>on</i> the altar upon the burnt-offering: they <i>were</i> consecrations for a sweet savor; it <i>is</i> an offering made by fire unto the Lord.</p>

<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p54"></A><b>29.</b> And Moses took the breast, and waved it <i>for</i> a wave-offering before the <i>Lord: for</i> of the ram of consecration it was Moses&#8217; part; as the Lord commanded Moses.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p55"></A><b>29.</b> Tulitque Moses pectus, et agitavit illud agitatione coram Jehova: et ex ariete consecrationum ipsi Most fuit in partera, quemadmodum praeceperat Jehova ipsi Most.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p56"></A><b>30.</b> And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which <i>was</i> upon the altar, and sprinkled <i>it</i> upon Aaron, <i>and</i> upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons&#8217; garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, <i>and</i> his garments, and his sons, and his sons&#8217; garments with him.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p57"></A><b>30.</b> Tulit etiam Moses ex oleo unctionis, et de sanguine qui erat super altare, aspersitque super Aharon, super vestes ejus, et super filios ejus, et super vestes filiorum ejus cum eo: consecravitque Aharonem, et vestes ejus, et filios ejus, et vestes filiorum ejus cum eo.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p58"></A><b>31.</b> And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; and there eat it with the bread that <i>is</i> in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p59"></A><b>31.</b> Et dixit Moses ad Aharon et ad filios ejus, Coquite carnes ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis, ibi deniqne comedite eam, et panem qui est in canistro consecrationum, quemadmodum praecepi, dicendo, Aharon et filii ejus comedent eam.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p60"></A><b>32.</b> And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.</p>

<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p62"></A><b>33.</b> And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation <i>in</i> seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p63"></A><b>33.</b> Et ex ostio tabernaculi conventionis non egrediemini septem diebus, usque ad diem qua completi fuerint dies consecrationum vestrarum: septem enim diebus consecrabit manum vestram.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p64"></A><b>34.</b> As he hath done this day, <i>so</i> the Lord hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p65"></A><b>34.</b> quemadmodum fecit in die hac, praecepit Jehova facere ad expiandum vos.</p>

<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.v-p68"></A><b>36.</b> So Aaron and his sons did all things which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses.</p>

<p><a name="vii.v-p71"></A><a name="vii.v-p71.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vii.v-p72"></A><b>4. </b><i>And Moses did as the Lord commanded him</i>  Although these things relate to the priesthood, the authority and nature of which I expounded under the Second Commandment, yet, inasmuch as they are historical, it is not without reason that I have thought fit to defer them till this place: for, if I had referred to 			 them in connection with the Commandment, unpractised readers would not have easily taken notice of their time. This distinction, however, will be of great assistance to them, that after the doctrine which was properly contained in the Decalogue has been set forth, they will now see how faithfully Moses fulfilled whatever he was commanded, and will be able to compare his obedience with the injunction, as they have done in the whole of the making and dedication of the tabernacle. Besides, there 			 is no question but that the narrative must be thus connected; for it may be readily inferred from many passages, that the priests were anointed on the same day that the tabernacle was consecrated. I will now hastily run through the words. Moses says that he brought near Aaron and his sons, <i>i.e.,</i> to set them before God and the people; and then that he &#8220;washed them with water,&#8221; to make it manifest that they did not bring from their homes the 			 purity which befitted the sanctity of their office, and, inasmuch as they were men, that they could not be clean before God, unless their impurity was washed off. A description of their apparel afterwards follows, which I pass over, lest I should weary my readers by twice repeating the same thing.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.v-p73"></A><a name="vii.v-p73.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vii.v-p74"></A><b>10. </b><i>And Moses took the anointing oil</i>  I have stated why God commanded that the priest himself, as well as all the vessels, should be consecrated with oil, viz., because, without the influence of the Spirit, all the sacrifices would be unsavory. And it is by the operation of the same Spirit that Christ was made 			 the peace-maker between God and men; because this dignity would not otherwise belong to flesh and human nature. Aaron was therefore anointed, together with his sons, before he was admitted to the priestly office; for it is afterwards added, that &#8220;the bullock for sin&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_404"></A><A HREF="#fn_404"><FONT SIZE="1">405</FONT></A>
 			  was brought, upon which Aaron laid his hands. Now, although even then he began to discharge his office, yet Moses still occupied the first place, and performed, as it were, the final act. Hence it was that he sprinkled the horns of the altar with the blood; poured the residue at its base for expiation; and burned the sacrifice upon the altar. Now, the imposition of hands in the sacrifices was not only a symbol of 			 presentation, but also a testimony of guilt transferred to the victim. Since, however, this last statement may be obscure on account of its brevity, I will explain it a little more clearly. If any private person offered a victim, the imposition of hands signified that he cast the guilt of his sin upon the victim. Hence the name of <i>piaculum</i>;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_405"></A><A HREF="#fn_405"><FONT SIZE="1">406</FONT></A>
 			  because it sustained the curse of God, and was substituted in the sinner&#8217;s stead, who disburdens himself upon it of whatever exposed him to the judgment of God. But, inasmuch as common hands were unworthy to consecrate a victim to God, the sacerdotal office interposed. This is the reason why Aaron and his sons put their hands on each of the sacrifices, in order that this kind of atonement <i>(piaculi)</i> might be the 			 beginning of their consecration, which was completed in the second ram, with the blood of which Moses stained their right ears, the thumbs of their right hands, and the great toes of their right feet. A multitude of questions here arises: Why only one side of the priests was consecrated, as if their left side remained polluted? Why consecration was not also imparted to their eyes, and especially to their mouth, which was to be the organ of the Holy Spirit? But this warning must be always borne 			 in mind, that we should be soberly wise in those points, the certain knowledge of which cannot be elicited from Scripture; for our curiosity is not only frivolous, but also perverse and injurious, when we desire to know more than God has revealed. The conjecture, however, is probable, that the whole body was consecrated in the right side. We have already seen elsewhere,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_406"></A><A HREF="#fn_406"><FONT SIZE="1">407</FONT></A>
 			  that by the hands and feet the whole life and actions of men are designated. In which view the cleanness of the heart and the purity of the hands comprehend all that is internal and external in man, as the root and the fruit. As to the feet, the metaphor of <i>walking</i> is notorious; and the feet are said to run to evil, and to be swift to shed blood, when the wicked and the despisers of God betake themselves to evil 			 deeds. Besides, since this consecration was not to the office of teaching, but to that of intercession, the ear rather than the tongue is stained with blood; because the chief virtue, which obtains grace in the sacrifices, is obedience. To this the passage in <a name="vii.v-p78.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006">Ps 40:6</a><a name="vii.v-p78.2"></A>, refers, &#8220;Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou bored:&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_407"></A><A HREF="#fn_407"><FONT SIZE="1">408</FONT></A>
 			  to which the words of Jeremiah correspond,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="vii.v-p80"></A>&#8220;Did I command anything respecting sacrifices, and not rather that your fathers should obey my voice?&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_408"></A><A HREF="#fn_408"><FONT SIZE="1">409</FONT></A>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="vii.v-p82"></A>And hence Moses commenced the consecration at the ear, in order to devote the priest to God unto obedience. Paul shews how this was fulfilled in Christ, where he celebrates His obedience in the sacrifice of His death, in order to reconcile His Father to us.
