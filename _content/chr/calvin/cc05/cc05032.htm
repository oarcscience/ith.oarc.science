<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text21"><a name="iii.ii-p7"></A><b>18. </b><i>Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself</i><a name="iii.ii-p7.1"></A>. What every man&#8217;s mind ought to be towards his neighbor, could not be better expressed in many pages that in this one sentence. We are all of us not only inclined to love ourselves more than we should, but all our powers hurry us away in this direction; nay, <a name="iii.ii-p7.2"></A>&#966;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8055;&#945;<a name="iii.ii-p7.3"></A> (self-love) blinds us so much as to be the parent of all iniquities. Since, therefore, whilst we are too much given to love ourselves, we forget and neglect our brethren, God could only bring us back to charity by plucking from our hearts that vicious passion which is born with us and dwells deeply in us; nor, again, could this be done except by transferring elsewhere the love which exists within us. On this point no 			 less has the dishonesty betrayed itself than the ignorance and folly of those   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_184"><FONT SIZE="1">185</FONT></A>
 			 <a name="iii.ii-p8.3"></A> who would have the love of ourselves come first: &#8220;The rule (say they) is superior to the thing regulated by it; and according to God&#8217;s commandment, the charity which we should exercise towards others is formed upon the love of ourselves as its rule.&#8221; As if it were God&#8217;s purpose to stir up the fire which already burns too fiercely. Naturally, as I have said, we are blinded by our immoderate self-love; and God, in order to turn us away from this, has substituted our 			 neighbors, whom we are to love no less than ourselves; nor will any one ever perform what Paul teaches us to be a part of charity, viz., that she &#8220;seeketh not her own,&#8221; (<a name="iii.ii-p8.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#005">1Co 13:5</a><a name="iii.ii-p8.4"></A><a name="iii.ii-p8.5"></A>,) until he shall have renounced himself.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="iii.ii-p9"></A>Not only those with whom we have some connection are called our <i>neighbors</i>, but all without exception; for the whole human race forms one body, of which all are members, and consequently should be bound together by mutual ties; for we must bear in mind that even those who are most alienated from us, should be cherished and aided even as our own flesh; since we have  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">186</FONT></A>
 			 seen elsewhere that sojourners and strangers are placed in the same category (with our relations;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">187</FONT></A>
 			 ) and Christ sufficiently confirms this in the case of the Samaritan. (<a name="iii.ii-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030">Lu 10:30</a><a name="iii.ii-p11.1"></A>.)</p>
