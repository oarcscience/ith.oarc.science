<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.ii-p9"></A><b>4.</b> And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the Lord spake unto you in the mount, out of the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly: and the Lord gave them unto me.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.ii-p10"></A><b>4.</b> Tunc scripsit in tabulis juxta scripturam priorem decem verba quae loquutus fuerat Jehova vobiscum in monte, e medio ignis, in die conventus: et dedit illas mihi Jehova.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.ii-p11"></A><b>5.</b> And I turned myself, and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the Lord commanded me.</p>

<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.ii-p13"></A><b>10.</b> And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also, <i>and</i> the Lord would not destroy thee.</p>

<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.ii-p15"></A><b>11.</b> And the Lord said unto me, Arise, take <i>thy</i> journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vii.ii-p16"></A><b>11.</b> Itaque dixit mihi Jehova, Surge, vade, proficiscendo ante populum ut ingrediantur et possideant terram quam juravi patribus eorum me daturum illis.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vii.ii-p19"></A><b>1. </b><i>At that time the Lord said unto me</i>  He had had intercourse with the people for some time, before he returned into the mount with the second tables; and therefore he now begins to relate more fully what he had already mentioned in the inverted order of time, <i>i.e.,</i> that he stayed in the mount forty days to make entreaty for them. And this also the repetition in the 10th verse more clearly demonstrates, where he says, that he stayed in the mount &#8220;according   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_392"></A><A HREF="#fn_392"><FONT SIZE="1">393</FONT></A>
 			  to the first days.&#8221; But, although he there says that he was hearkened to when he interceded in the mount, still he includes the prayers which he had previously offered when he heard of the people&#8217;s revolt, and after he had broken the tables and taken away God&#8217;s tabernacle, in which he prayed apart to obtain pardon for their sin. What is also here said respecting the ark is not in its proper place; for it was a part of the tabernacle, as we have elsewhere seen. It 			 is, therefore, exacting too much to require that the things which are related together, should be referred to the same instant of time.</p>
