<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vii.xiv-p41"></A><b>11. </b><i>And it came to pass on the twentieth day</i>  Moses records that after leaving Mount Sinai, the camp was first pitched in the wilderness of Paran; and although the distance was not great, &#8212; being, as we shall soon see, a three days&#8217; journey, &#8212; still the fatigue was sufficient to harass and weary the people. 			 It is mentioned in praise of their obedience that they were expeditious in setting forth &#8220;according to the commandment of God;&#8221; but presently, through failure of the spirit of perseverance, their levity and inconstancy betrayed itself.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text21"><a name="vii.xiv-p42"></A><a name="vii.xiv-p42.1"></A>When it is said that &#8220;they journeyed by their journeyings,&#8221; <i>(profectos</i> <i>esse</i> <i>per</i> <i>suas</i> <i>profectiones,)</i><a name="vii.xiv-p42.2"></A> it refers to their whole progress through the desert. As to the word, I know 			 not why Jerome translated it <i>turmas,</i><a name="vii.xiv-p42.3"></A> (troops,) for its root; is the verb <a name="vii.xiv-p42.4"></A>&#1504;&#1505;&#1506; <i>nasang,</i><a name="vii.xiv-p42.5"></A> which is used with it; and according to its constant use in Scripture, it plainly means stations,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_426"></A><A HREF="#fn_426"><FONT SIZE="1">427</FONT></A>
 			 <a name="vii.xiv-p44.1"></A> or halting-places. We say in Frealch <i>journees,</i><a name="vii.xiv-p44.2"></A> or <i>gistes.</i></p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vii.xiv-p46"></A><b>14. </b><i>In the first place went the standard of the camp</i>  The actual order of march is here described. The whole people, with the exception of the Levites, is divided into four hosts, or parts, since four of the tribes were set over the others, so as to have two under the command of each. And this was the mode of 			 proceeding, that whenever they halted anywhere, the four standards encompassed the sanctuary and the Ark of the Covenant from the four quarters of the world; whilst on the march, the Levites carrying the tabernacle, according to the burdens respectively imposed upon them, were mixed with the several bands. The Ark, borne upon the shoulders of the Levites, preceded the whole army, in order that all might more confidently follow, God thus manifestly shewing them the way. Nahshon, of the tribe of 			 Judah, led the first host; Elizur, of the tribe of Reuben, the second; Elishama, of the tribe of Ephraim, the third; and Ahiezer, of the tribe of Dan, the fourth. It is obvious that in the precedency given to the tribe of Judah, God in some degree afforded an anticipation of the prophecy of Jacob; for the Reubenites, being descended from the first-born, would not have willingly abandoned their position, unless that right had been transferred to the tribe of Judah by God&#8217;s decree, pronounced 			 through the mouth of Jacob. Not that the sovereignty and royal power was actually his before the time of David, but because God would have a single spark to shine in the midst of the thick darkness, whereby He might cherish the hope of the promised salvation in every heart; and that thus the dignity of this tribe might at length more readily reduce all to obedience. Herein, however, it appeared how perverse and intractable was the spirit of that greater portion of them who strove against the 			 divine decree in their rejection of David.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vii.xiv-p47"></A>Reuben occupied the second place, as an alleviation of his disgrace. Again, by the subjection of the tribe of Manasseh to the posterity of Ephraim, in this respect, too, the prophecy of the same patriarch was fulfilled. Nor does there seem to be any other reason why the fourth standard should have been given to the tribe of Dan, except because Jacob had declared, &#8220;Dan shall judge his people.&#8221; (<a name="vii.xiv-p47.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#016">Ge 49:16</a><a name="vii.xiv-p47.1"></A>,) by which expression his pre-eminence was denoted.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vii.xiv-p48"></A>Although it may be that the four standard-bearing tribes were chosen from their strength and the numbers of their people, still, unless the children of Reuben and Manasseh had been thoroughly persuaded that their degradation was in accordance with the command of God, their jealousy would never have suffered them calmly to submit themselves to others, whose superiors they were by the ordinary rules of nature. Their self-restraint, therefore, 			 was praiseworthy, in that voluntary subjection kept them within bounds, without the application of any power of compulsion; and at the end, Moses records that it was not once only that they thus advanced, but that they observed the same order and regulations during the whole course of their travel, and that their camp was always so arranged that no contention arose to disturb them.</p>
