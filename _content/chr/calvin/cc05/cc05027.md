<span id="ii.v.iii-p1"></span>Supplement to the Ninth Commandment

<span id="ii.v.iii.i"></span>

<span id="ii.v.iii.i-p3"></span>**16.** If a false witness rise up
against any man, to testify against him *that* *which* *is* wrong;

<span id="ii.v.iii.i-p4"></span>**16.** Quum steterit testis mendax
contra aliquem, ut testificetur contra eum verbum perversum:

<span id="ii.v.iii.i-p5"></span>**17.** Then both the men, between whom
the controversy *is*, shall stand before the Lord, before the priests
and the judges which shall be in those days:

<span id="ii.v.iii.i-p6"></span>**17.** Tunc stabunt duo illi homines
quibus est lis, coram Jehova, id est coram sacerdotibus et judicibus qui
fuerint in diebus illis.

<span id="ii.v.iii.i-p7"></span>**18.** And the judges shall make
diligent inquisition: and, behold, *if* the witness *be* a false
witness, *and* hath testified falsely against his brother;

<span id="ii.v.iii.i-p8"></span>**18.** Et inquirent judices diligenter,
et si testis ille est testis mendax, mendacium testificatus est contra
fratrem suum:

<span id="ii.v.iii.i-p9"></span>**19.** Then shall ye do unto him as he
had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil
away from among you.

<span id="ii.v.iii.i-p10"></span>**19.** Facietis ei, quemadmodum
cogitavit facere fratri suo, et auferes malum e medio tui.

<span id="ii.v.iii.i-p11"></span>**20.** And those which remain shall
hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among
you.

<span id="ii.v.iii.i-p12"></span>**20.** Et qui remanserint, audient ac
timebunt, nec addent facere ultra malum simile huic in medio tui.

<span id="ii.v.iii.i-p13"></span>**21.** And thine eye shall not pity;
*but* life *shall* *go* for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for
hand, foot for foot.

<span id="ii.v.iii.i-p14"></span>**21.** Neque parcet oculus tuus:
animam pro anima, oculum pro oculo, dentem pro dente, manum pro manu,
pedem pro pede.

<span id="ii.v.iii.i-p15"></span> 

<span id="ii.v.iii.i-p16"></span><span id="ii.v.iii.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.iii.i-p17"></span>**16.** *If a false witness rise up
against any man*. Because the fear of God does not so prevail in all
men, as that they should voluntarily abstain from the love of slander,
God here appoints the punishment to be inflicted for perjury: for
political laws are enacted against the ungodly and disobedient, in order
that those who despise God’s judgment should be brought before the
tribunal of men. Although perjury is not here ordained to be tried
before the judges, unless there should be an accuser, who should
complain that he had been unjustly injured by false-witness, still
reason dictates, that if any man have been condemned to death by
false-witnesses, the judges should not hesitate to make an official
inquiry into the matter. Yet, inasmuch as men are generally disposed to
assert their own innocence, God has deemed it sufficient to put the
case, that if any complaint should be lodged, the judges should
diligently investigate it, and if the crime be proved, should inflict
the punishment of retaliation (*talionis*.) Whence it appears that
false-witnesses and murderers stand in the same light before God. By
commanding that the inquiry should be made not only by the judges, but
also by the priests, as if God Himself were present, He shews that He
requires unusual diligence to be used; because a secret crime is not
easily detected without the most anxious care.
