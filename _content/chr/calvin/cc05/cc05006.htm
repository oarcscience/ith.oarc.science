<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text21"><a name="ii.i.iv.i-p13"></A><a name="ii.i.iv.i-p13.1"></A>The commandment is now sanctioned by the denunciation of capital punishment for its violation, <i>yet</i><a name="ii.i.iv.i-p13.2"></A> not so as to comprehend all who have in any respect sinned against their parents, but sufficient to show that the rights of parents are sacred, and not to be violated without the greatest criminality. We know that 				  parricides   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>
 				  <a name="ii.i.iv.i-p14.1"></A> as being the most detestable of all men, were formerly sewn up in a leathern sack and cast into the water; but God proceeds further, when He commands all those to be exterminated who have laid violent hands on their parents   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>
 				  <a name="ii.i.iv.i-p15.1"></A> or addressed them in abusive language. For to <i>smite</i><a name="ii.i.iv.i-p15.2"></A> does not only mean to kill, but refers to any violence, although no wound may have been inflicted. If, then, any one had struck his father or mother with his fist, or with a stick, the punishment of such an act of madness was the same as for murder. And, assuredly, it is an abominable and monstrous thing for a son not 				  to hesitate to assault those from whom he has received his life; nor can it be but that impunity accorded to so foul a crime must straightway produce cruel barbarism. The second law avenges not only violence done to parents, but also, abusive words, which soon proceed to grosser insults and atrocious contempt. Still, if any one should have lightly let drop some slight reproach, as is often the case ill a quarrel, this severe punishment was not to be inflicted upon such, all inconsiderate piece 				  of impertinence: and the word <a name="ii.i.iv.i-p15.3"></A>&#1511;&#1500;&#1500;<a name="ii.i.iv.i-p15.4"></A>, <i>kalal</i><a name="ii.i.iv.i-p15.5"></A>, from which the participle used by Moses is derived, not only means to reproach, but also to curse, as well as to esteem lightly, and to despise. Whilst, therefore, not every insult, whereby the reverence due to parents was violated, received the punishment of death, still God would have that 				  impious pride, which would subvert the first principles of nature, held in abhorrence. But, inasmuch as it might seem hard that a word,   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A>
 				  <a name="ii.i.iv.i-p16.1"></A> however unworthy of a dutiful son, should be the cause of death; this objection is met, by what is added by God in Leviticus, &#8220;his blood shall be upon him, <i>because</i><a name="ii.i.iv.i-p16.2"></A> he hath cursed his father or mother:&#8221; as if He would put a stop to what men might otherwise presume to allege in mitigation of the severity of the punishment. </p>  <a name="ii.i.iv.ii"></A>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.i.iv.ii-p13"></A><b>18. </b><i>If</i> <i>a</i> <i>man</i> <i>have</i> <i>a</i> <i>stubborn</i>. What God had previously adverted to in two clauses, tie now embraces in a general law, for it cannot be doubted but that by rebellious children all are designated who are abusive or insulting to their father and mother. For if it be a capital crime to be disobedient to parents, much more is it to strike, or beat 				  them, and to assail them with reproachful words. In sum, Moses declares that those are deserving of death who are of such a stubborn and intractable disposition as to reject the authority of their father and mother, and to hold them in contempt. Whence also we infer what it is to honor our father and mother, for the punishment is only denounced for the transgression of the Commandment. When, therefore, the law delivers over to death all who contumaciously rebel against the discipline of their 				  parents, it follows that they have refused them their due honor. An admirable means, however, of moderating the severity of the law is introduced, when God requires the case to be decided on the evidence of the father and mother; and commands that it should be publicly heard, so that none may be condemned at the will of private individuals. By the Roman law the power of life and death over his children   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A>
 				   was given to the father, because it was not probable that fathers would be carried away by such senseless inhumanity as to deal cruelly with their own bowels; but, since sometimes fathers are found who are not unlike wild beasts, and examples show us that many, blinded by hate or avarice, have not spared their own children, this concession of the Roman law is justly to be repudiated. I allow, indeed, that those who desired to inflict punishment on their children 				  called their friends into council; but, whereas, the walls of a private dwelling conceal many disgraceful things, God imposed a much better restraint on parents when He did not suffer them to go further than to lay the information and to give their testimony. For, although he would have credit given to their testimony, still, when the children were brought to the tribunal of the judges, a legal trim undoubtedly ensued; and this form of proceeding is prescribed, viz., that the father and mother 				  should bring their son and make their complaint before the judges of his incorrigible stubbornness. It is true that the sentence is immediately subjoined; yet we must infer, nevertheless, that the judges pronounced it before the criminal was stoned, else it would have been ridiculous that they should sit there like cyphers. The very mention of a trial, therefore, implies that the son was heard in his defense, so as to clear himself of the crime, if he was not guilty of it: for, suppose the 				  moroseness of the father and mother were notorious; or that the father accused the son by the instigation of a stepmother; or that any unworthy spite were discovered; or that the father and mother had conspired to destroy their son in a fit of passion: the defense of the cause is, therefore, implied in the adverb <i>then</i>,   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A>
 				   for it would have been more than absurd that the son should be condemned without being heard. Especially, when he was to be stoned by the whole people, it was necessary that he should be first convicted; and on this ground he was brought forth publicly, that he might be allowed to plead his cause. But although those were condemned who were addicted to other vices also, yet Moses expressly mentions <i>gluttons</i> and <i>drunkards</i>, <i>to</i> show that, although no capital crime were alleged, still, dissolute profligacy was sufficient, if the son could not be corrected by his parents; for it is plain that those are in a desperate state who have so east away submissiveness 				  and shame as to receive no profit from the admonitions of their parents. From the end of the verse we gather what was the twofold object of the punishment &#8212; that the earth should be purged of the sins whereby it was in a manner, polluted, and that the death of him who had transgressed might be an example to all.</p>  <a name="ii.i.iv.iii"></A>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.i.iv.iii-p11"></A><b><a name="ii.i.iv.iii-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028">Exodus 22:28</a><a name="ii.i.iv.iii-p11.1"></A>.</b> <i>Thou</i> <i>shalt</i> <i>not</i> <i>revile</i> <i>the</i> <i>gods</i>. These four passages confirm what I have said, that in the: Fifth Commandment are comprised, by <i>synecdoche</i> all superiors in authority.: For it was not the design 				  of God to add to the Two Tables, as if something better and more perfect had afterwards come into His mind; which it is sinful to suppose. He was therefore content with the rule once laid down, although He afterwards spoke in a more explanatory manner. But the precepts here given would be unconnected with the Law, if they were not an adjunct, and therefore a part, of the Fifth Commandment.</p>  				
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.i.iv.iii-p12"></A>First of all, He commands that we should think and speak reverently of judges, and others, who exercise the office of magistrate: nor is it to be questioned, that, in the ordinary idiom of the Hebrew language, He repeats the same thing twice over; and consequently that the same persons are called &#8220;gods,&#8221; and &#8220;rulers of the people.&#8221; The name of God is, figuratively indeed, but most reasonably, applied to magistrates, upon whom, as the 				  ministers of His authority, He has inscribed a mark of His glory. For, as we have seen that honor is due to fathers, because God has associated them with Himself in the possession of the name, so also here His own dignity is claimed for judges, in order that the people may reverence them, because they are God&#8217;s representatives, as His lieutenants, and vicars. And so Christ, the surest expositor, explains it, when He quotes the passage from 				  <a name="ii.i.iv.iii-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006">Ps 82:6</a><a name="ii.i.iv.iii-p12.1"></A>, &#8220;I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you are children of the Most High,&#8221; (<a name="ii.i.iv.iii-p12.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#034">Joh 10:34</a><a name="ii.i.iv.iii-p12.2"></A>,) viz., &#8220;that they are called gods, unto whom the word of God came,&#8221; which is to be understood not of the general instruction addressed to all God&#8217;s children, but of the special command to rule.</p>  				
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="ii.i.iv.iii-p13"></A>It is a signal exaltation of magistrates, that God should not only count them in the place of parents, but present them to us dignified by His own name; whence also it clearly appears that they are not to be obeyed only from fear of punishment, &#8220;but also for conscience sake,&#8221; (<a name="ii.i.iv.iii-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#005">Ro 13:5</a><a name="ii.i.iv.iii-p13.1"></A>,) and to be reverently honored, lest God should be despised 				  in them. If any should object, that it would be wrong to praise the vices of those whom we perceive to abuse their power; the answer is easy, that although judges are to be borne with even if they be not the best,  				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A>
 				  still that the honor with which they are invested, is not a covering for <i>vice</i>. Nor does God command us to applaud their faults, but that the people should rather deplore them in silent sorrow, than raise disturbances in a licentious and seditious spirit, and so subvert political government.</p>  <a name="ii.i.iv.iv"></A>

God teaches us that some sparks of His majesty shine forth in old men, whereby they approach to the honor of parents. 				  It is not my purpose to gather quotations from profane authors in reference to the honor due to the old; let it <i>suffice</i> that what God here commands is dictated by nature itself. This appeared at Athens,   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A>
 				   when an old man had come into the theater, and found no place among his fellow-citizens; but, when at length he was admitted with honor by the Spartan ambassador, (because old age is greatly reverenced among the Lacedemonians,) applause was raised on all sides; and then the Lacedemonian exclaimed, that &#8220;the Athenians knew what was right, but would not do it.&#8221; It was surely manifested by this universal consent of the people that it is a natural law in the hearts 				  of all to reverence and honor old men. Many old men, indeed, either by their levity, or lewdness, or sloth, subvert their own dignity; yet, although gray hairs may not always be accompanied by courteous wisdom, still, in itself, age is venerable, according to God&#8217;s command.</p>  <a name="ii.i.iv.v"></A>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.i.iv.v-p7"></A><b>18. </b><i>Judges</i> <i>and</i> <i>officers</i> <i>shalt</i> <i>thou</i> <i>make</i>. I have placed this passage among the Supplements of the Fifth Commandment, for, if it pleases God that judges should be appointed for ruling the people, it follows that their laws and edicts should be obeyed; and thus the parental authority extends also to them. But, in order that the 				  people may more readily submit themselves to judges, God reminds them that the human race could not otherwise be preserved. Public utility, therefore, renders the authority of magistrates pleasant and agreeable, though it would else be hateful. But, although it be not conceded to all to elect their judges, because God honored His chosen people with this prerogative, still he here recommends in general a regular government, since He signifies that human society cannot hold together unless the 				  lawful rulers have authority to execute justice. Whether, then, magistrates are appointed by the suffrages of the people, or imposed in any other way, let us learn that they are the necessary ministers of God, to confine all men under the yoke of the laws. The latter passage, which I have annexed from <a name="ii.i.iv.v-p7.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#000">Deuteronomy 7</a><a name="ii.i.iv.v-p7.1"></A>, refers to the same thing, viz., that even in war discipline is necessary, lest all things should be thrown into confusion. Now, if it pleases God that certain superior officers 				  should have the command, it follows that they must be obeyed; for it would be ridiculous to appoint governors, if it were lawful to despise them with impunity. When, therefore, God sets military commanders over the people, He enforces the duty of humble submission.</p>
