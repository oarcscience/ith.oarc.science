<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.v-p33"></A><b>1. </b><i>And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken</i>. He teaches the same thing as before in different words; but the diversity of expression, as well as the repetition, tends to its confirmation. First, God says that He would deal with them so bountifully that they should excel all other nations; for this is the meaning of the words, that 			 they should be illustrious above all the rest of the world on account of the special blessings of God. He afterwards enumerates the blessings which shall never depart from them, if they persevere in the service of God; and here it must be observed that they are reminded, not only in how many ways God is bountiful towards His servants, but also to how many necessities they are exposed, which require His direct and constant aid; for if we are blessed in the city and in the field, we can no more 			 move a foot than stand still, except by His blessing. Such also is the tendency of the whole list, that a scarcity of all things impends over us at every moment, unless God should continually succor us by remedies sent down from heaven, and that every good thing can only come from that one source.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.v-p34"></A><a name="v.v-p34.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.v-p35"></A><b>9. </b><i>The Lord shall establish thee a holy people unto himself</i>. This refers indeed to earthly blessings, as if Moses said, that by them would be manifested God&#8217;s love towards His chosen people; still it rises higher, so that the Israelites, led on by degrees, should learn to embrace God alone, and to trust in Him according to the covenant which 			 He had made with Abraham, &#8220;I am thy exceeding great reward.&#8221; (<a name="v.v-p35.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001">Ge 15:1</a><a name="v.v-p35.1"></A>.) For the children of Abraham were set apart and chosen to be a holy people, not only in order that, being well fed, and with a full belly, they should aspire to nothing but earthly things, but that they might be confidently assured that they would be blessed in death as well as life. Although their adoption was 			 gratuitous, still, inasmuch as they were called unto purity, it is not without reason that God promises that what He had spoken should be sure, if by keeping the Law the Israelites themselves should continue in the covenant; as much as to say, that their sanctification   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">215</FONT></A>
 			  should be firm and perpetual if they walked in the commandments of the Law. When He adds that it should be manifest &#8220;to   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_215"></A><A HREF="#fn_215"><FONT SIZE="1">216</FONT></A>
 			  all people of the earth that the name of God was called upon them,&#8221; it is equivalent to saying, that it should be known that they were under God&#8217;s defense and patronage, and that thus they should always be safe and secure in His protection.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.v-p38"></A><a name="v.v-p38.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.v-p39"></A><b>12. </b><i>The Lord shall open to thee his good treasure</i>. He again repeats, that the goodness of God shines forth in many ways in the life of men, since He not only supplies the bread that they eat, but that the rain which descends from heaven waters the earth; and that thus He produces whatever is required for food from His plenteous store-house 			 or treasure. Let us learn, therefore, both above and beneath, as well in the temperature of the atmosphere, in the quickening heat of the sun, in the rain, and in other means, as in the fertility of the earth, to contemplate the manifold riches which God brings forth from His treasures. And when He declares that He will bless the work of our hands, hence, too, let us learn that we can attain nothing by our industry and hardest labors, except in so far as God vouchsafes us good success; and that 			 all our efforts without His secret blessing are mere useless fatigue. For the figure which Paul uses in reference to the spiritual culture of the Church, is taken from nature itself:</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.v-p40"></A>&#8220;Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.&#8221; (<a name="v.v-p40.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#007">1Co 3:7</a><a name="v.v-p40.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="v.v-p41"></A>God would not, indeed, have  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">217</FONT></A>
 			 us lie idle, and therefore He requires the labor of our hands, but He would have the fruit of our labors attributed to Himself.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.v-p43"></A>After having spoken of the whole Law, and forbidden that they should turn aside to the right or the left, He adverts to the principal point, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that they should not revolt to strange gods. Wherefore, the sum comes to this, that, in order that God may continue to shew us the favor which He has begun towards us, we ought on our sides to be altogether submissive to His rule. This indeed He demands of us by His word, and enables us 			 to perform it by the power of His Spirit; not, it is true, fully to do our duty, but to strive to reach the goal; and, whereas we are far from attaining perfection, His indulgence supplies what is wanting in us.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="v.v-p44"></A>Here, however, a difficult question arises, &#8212; If all prosperity proceeds from the peculiar blessing which God vouchsafes to His servants, whence is it that many of His despisers have children, easy and happy circumstances, abundance of the fruits of fire earth, enjoyment and luxury, honors and power? I answer, that the happy condition of life, which He assigns to His servants, does not prevent Him from diffusing His bounty promiscuously over the 			 whole human race. He is truly called in <a name="v.v-p44.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006">Ps 36:6</a><a name="v.v-p44.1"></A>, the preserver of &#8220;man and beast.&#8221; It is said elsewhere,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">218</FONT></A>
 			 that His mercy is extended over all His creatures, (<a name="v.v-p45.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#017">Ps 145:17</a><a name="v.v-p45.1"></A>;) and justly does Christ exalt His unbounded goodness, in that &#8220;He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good.&#8221; (<a name="v.v-p45.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045">Mt 5:45</a><a name="v.v-p45.2"></A>.) But equally true is the exclamation of the Prophet;</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.v-p46"></A>&#8220;Oh, how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up<br> 			 for them that fear thee!&#8221; (<a name="v.v-p46.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019">Ps 31:19</a><a name="v.v-p46.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="v.v-p47"></A>For since all without exception enjoy all the supports of life, God&#8217;s goodness, which thus contends with the wickedness of men, shines forth universally even towards the ungodly, so that He does not cease to cherish and preserve those whom He has created, although they be unworthy. He therefore does good to the ungodly, because He is their Creator; besides, in order to keep the minds of believers in suspense in expectation of the final judgment, 			 He now suffers many things to be confusedly mixed together, and hides His judgment in the darkness of night, as it were, or at least under clouds; whilst He also so tempers His patience towards the reprobate, as that, in this confusion of which I have spoken, some signs of His anger and favor are manifested. Thus, although the government of the world is not yet reduced to a perfect rule, still God shews by it that He is both the avenger of sins and the rewarder of righteousness, and some sparks 			 are seen through the darkness; whilst the faithful, although they do not attain to the full enjoyment of the blessing promised them, nevertheless taste of it as far as is expedient. But to the ungodly, although they abound with all sorts of good things, not a single drop of God&#8217;s goodness is dispensed; for unless a sense of God&#8217;s paternal favor is awakened by His blessing, the blessing itself ceases to exist; nay, the more they gorge themselves, they attain to a deadly fatness; and God 			 purposely lifts them up, that He may cast them down more heavily from their high estate. In a word, they are fed, as the Prophet says,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_218"></A><A HREF="#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">219</FONT></A>
 			 &#8220;unto the day of slaughter.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.v-p49"></A>It must be concluded, therefore, that the blessings which God here promises to His servants are seasoned by Him with spiritual salt, lest they should be tasteless; whilst the reprobate, who are destitute of a sense of His grace, are also deprived altogether of all His blessings. There still, however, remains a difficulty, because the felicity here spoken of does not always, nor equally fall to the lot of God&#8217;s servants; nay, even under the Law 			 they were sharply tried by many troubles and adversities. I answer, that since none, not even the most holy, was ever a perfect keeper of the Law, since none was ever free from all transgression, it is no cause of surprise that they only partially enjoyed the promised blessings; inasmuch as they were not fit recipients (<i>capaces</i>) of their fullness; and, if it sometimes happens that they are chastised more severely than the ungodly, neither in this is there any absurdity, since God usually 			 begins His judgment at His own house. (<a name="v.v-p49.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012">Isa 10:12</a><a name="v.v-p49.1"></A>; <a name="v.v-p49.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017">1Pe 4:17</a><a name="v.v-p49.2"></A>.) Still, even in this confusion we see what the Prophet teaches, that the righteous are never forsaken, (<a name="v.v-p49.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025">Ps 37:25</a><a name="v.v-p49.3"></A>,) and that they are like green and fruitful olive-trees in the courts 			 of the Lord, (<a name="v.v-p49.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#008">Ps 52:8</a><a name="v.v-p49.4"></A>,) whilst the ungodly, although for a season they may be exalted like cedars of Lebanon, yet are plucked up in a moment by the roots, so that no trace of them remains.</p>
