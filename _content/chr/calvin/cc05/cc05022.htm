<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p9"></A>God here explains somewhat more clearly His mind and design, for He enumerates as thefts eases in which either deceit or violence is employed. The two words, which we have translated to <i>deny</i>, and to <i>lie</i>, signify also to <i>deceive</i>; as also to <i>lie</i>, or to <i>frustrate</i> <i>hope</i>.  				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">98</FONT></A>
 				  There is no question, then, but that God would restrain His people from all craft, or deceit, that they may deal sincerely and honestly with each other; even as Paul wisely explains the meaning of the Holy Spirit, when he exhorts believers to</p>  				
<p class="SCRIPTURE25"><a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p11"></A>&#8220;put away lying, and to speak every man truth with his neighbor; for we are members one of another.&#8221; (<a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#025">Eph 4:25</a><a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p11.1"></A>.)</p>  				
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text21"><a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p12"></A><a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p12.1"></A>In the second passage, God commands men to demean themselves meekly and temperately with their neighbors, so as to abstain from all unjust oppression. The meaning which Jerome   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">99</FONT></A>
 				  <a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p13.2"></A> and others after him, have given to the word <a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p13.3"></A>&#1506;&#1513;&#1511; <i>gnashak</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p13.4"></A>, to <i>calumniate</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p13.5"></A>, is incorrect altogether; for it is everywhere used for to <i>oppress</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p13.6"></A>, <i>despoil</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p13.7"></A>, 				  <i>rob</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p13.8"></A>, or <i>lay</i> <i>hands</i> <i>on</i> <i>the</i> <i>goods</i> <i>of</i> <i>another</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p13.9"></A>. It is clear, therefore, that as Moses had previously 				  provided against frauds, he now prohibits the iniquity of extorting from our neighbor what we have no right to. Still, violence, or open rapine, is better expressed by the other word <a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p13.10"></A>&#1490;&#1494;&#1500; <i>gezal</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p13.11"></A>; and these   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_99"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">100</FONT></A>
 				  <a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p14.1"></A> two words are, ill my opinion, as it were, <i>genus</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p14.2"></A> and <i>species</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.i-p14.3"></A>. After he had forbidden, therefore, that they should in any way oppress their brethren and possess themselves of their goods, he at the same time adds, that they should not use violence in despoiling them unjustly. Finally, he points out one mode of unjust oppression, when a person, who has hired himself 				  as a laborer, is defrauded of his wages, and not only if he be sent away without payment, his wages being denied him, but if payment be deferred to the morrow. For we know that hirelings generally live from hand to mouth, and therefore, if there be ever so little delay, they must go without food. Consequently, if a rich man keeps a poor and wretched individual, whose labor he has abused, in suspense, he deprives him as it were of life, in depriving him of his daily food. The sum is, that 				  humanity is so to be cultivated that none should be oppressed, or suffer loss from default of payment.</p>  <a name="ii.iv.ii.ii"></A>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iv.ii.ii-p9"></A><b>14. </b><i>Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant</i>. This precept is akin to the foregoing. Moses pronounces that he who has hired a poor person for wages oppresses him unless he gives him immediate recompense for his labor; since the two admonitions, &#8220;thou shalt; not; oppress,&#8221; and &#8220;<i>thou</i> shalt give him his hire,&#8221; are to be read in connection with each other. Hence it follows, that if a hireling suffers from want because we do not pay him what he has earned, we are by our <i>very</i> delay alone convicted of unrighteousness. The reason is now more clearly expressed, viz., because he sustains his life by his daily labors.   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">101</FONT></A>
 				   Although, however, this provision only refers to the poor, lest they should suffer hunger from the negligence or pride of the rich, still humanity in general is enforced, lest, whilst the poor labor for our profit, we should arrogantly abuse them as if they were our slaves, or should be too illiberal and stingy towards them, since nothing can be more disgraceful than that, when they are in our service, they should not at least have 				  enough to live upon frugally. Finally, Moses admonishes us that this tyranny on the part of the rich shall not be unpunished, if they do not supply their workmen with the means of subsistence, even although no account shall be rendered of it before the tribunals of men. Hence we infer that this law is not political, but altogether spiritual, and binding on our consciences before the judgment-seat of God; for although the poor man may not sue us at law, Moses teaches us that it is sufficient for 				  him to appeal to the faithfulness of God. Wherefore, although the earthly judge may absolve us a hundred times over, let us not therefore think that we have escaped; since God will always require of us from heaven, whatever may have been unjustly excused us on earth. The question, however, here arises, whether, if he who has been oppressed should not cry out, the criminality will cease in consequence of his silence; for the words of Moses seem to imply this, when he says, that the rich will be 				  guilty, <i>if</i> the poor cry unto God and make complaint of their wrongs. The reply&#8217; is easy, that Moses had no other intention than to over-. throw the vain confidence of the despisers, whereby they arc, stimulated to greater audacity in sin, and are hardened in iniquity. He says, therefore, that although, as far as men are concerned, they may allow us to pillage and rob, still a more awful judgment is to be dreaded; for God hears the complaints of 				  the poor, who find no protector or avenger on earth. And surely, the more patiently he who is despoiled shall bear his wrong, the more ready will God be to undertake his cause; nor is there any louder cry to Him than patient endurance. If, however, any should object that the cry here spoken of is at variance with Christ&#8217;s command, that we should pray for our enemies, we answer at once, that God does not always approve of the prayers which He nevertheless answers. The imprecation of Jotham, the 				  son of Gideon, took effect upon the Shechemites, (<a name="ii.iv.ii.ii-p10.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#020">Jud 9:20</a><a name="ii.iv.ii.ii-p10.3"></A>,) although it was plainly the offspring of immoderate anger. Besides, it sometimes happens that the miserable, although they endure their injuries with pious meekness, still cease not to lay their sorrows and their groans in the bosom of God. Nor is this a slight consolation for the poor, that if no one on earth relieves 				  them because their condition is low and abject, still God will hereafter take cognizance of their cause.</p>  <a name="ii.iv.ii.iii"></A>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iv.ii.iii-p7"></A><b>4. </b><i>Thou shalt not muzzle the ox</i>. This passage, indeed, properly belongs to the Supplements of the Commandment, but, since it is a confirmation of the foregoing decree, it seemed fit to connect them; especially because its faithful expositor, Paul, declares, that God had no other design in delivering it than that the 				  laborer should not be defrauded of his just hire, (<a name="ii.iv.ii.iii-p7.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#010">1Co 9:10</a><a name="ii.iv.ii.iii-p7.1"></A>;) for, when he is speaking of the maintenance to be afforded to the ministers of the Gospel, he adduces it. in proof of his case. And, lest any should object that there is a difference between oxen and men, he adds, that God does not care for oxen, but that it was said for the sake of those that labor. 				  Meanwhile, we must bear in mind, that men are so instructed in equity, that they are bound to exercise it even towards the brute animals; for well does Solomon magnify the injustice, whereby our neighbor is injured, by the comparison; &#8220;A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast.&#8221; (<a name="ii.iv.ii.iii-p7.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#010">Pr 12:10</a><a name="ii.iv.ii.iii-p7.2"></A>.) The sum is, that we should freely and voluntarily pay what is right, and that 				  every one should be strict with himself as to the performance of his duty; for, if we are bound to supply subsistence to brute animals, much less must we wait for men to be importunate with us, in order that they may obtain their due.</p>  <a name="ii.iv.ii.iv"></A>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iv.ii.iv-p19"></A><b><a name="ii.iv.ii.iv-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#033">Leviticus 19:33</a><a name="ii.iv.ii.iv-p19.1"></A>.</b> <i>And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land</i>. Before I pass on to the other iniquities, I have thought fit to introduce this precept, wherein the people are commanded to cultivate equity towards all without exception. Fob if no mention had been made of 				  strangers, the Israelites would have thought that, provided they had not injured any one of their own nation, they had fully discharged their duty; but, when God recommends guests and sojourners to them, just as if they had been their own kindred, they thence understand that equity is to be cultivated constantly and towards all men. Nor is it without cause that God interposes Himself and His protection, lest injury should be done to strangers; for since they have no one who would submit to 				  ill-will in their defense, they are more exposed to the violence and various oppressions of the ungodly, than as if they were under the shelter of domestic securities. The same rule is to be observed towards widows and orphans; a woman, on account of the weakness of her sex, is exposed to many evils, unless she dwells under the shadow of a husband; and many plot against orphans, as if they were their prey, because they have none to advise them. Since, then, they are thus destitute of human aid, 				  God interposes to assist them; and, if they are unjustly oppressed, He declares that He will be their avenger. In the first passage He includes widows and orphans together with strangers; in the latter He enumerates strangers only; yet the substance is the same, viz., that all those who are destitute and deprived of earthly succor, are under the guardianship and protection of God, and preserved by His hand; and thus the audacity of those is restrained, who trust that they may commit any 				  wickedness with impunity, provided no earthly being resists them. No iniquity, indeed, will be left unavenged by God, but there is a special reason why He declares that strangers, widows, and orphans are taken under His care; inasmuch as the more flagrant the evil is, the greater need there is of an effectual remedy. He recommends strangers to them on this ground, that the people, who had themselves been sojourners in Egypt, being mindful of their ancient condition, ought to deal more kindly to 				  strangers; for although they were at last oppressed by cruel tyranny, still they were bound to consider their entrance there, viz., that poverty and hunger had driven their forefathers thither, and that <i>they</i> had been received hospitably, when they were in need of aid from others. When He threatens, that if the afflicted widows and orphans <i>cry</i> unto Him, their cry shall be heard, He does not mean 				  that He will not interfere, if they endure their wrongs in silence; but He speaks in <i>accordance</i> with the ordinary practice, that those who find no consolation elsewhere, are wont to appeal to Him. Meanwhile, let us be sure that although those who are injured abstain from complaining, yet God does not by any means forget His office, so as to overlook their wrongs. Nay, there is nothing which incites Him more to inflict punishment on the ungodly, 				  than the endurance of His servants.</p>  				
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iv.ii.iv-p20"></A>The nature of the punishment is also expressed; those who have afflicted widows and orphans shall perish by the sword, so that their own widows and orphans may be exposed to the audacity, violence, and knavery of the ungodly. Moreover, it must be observed that, in the second passage, they are commanded to love strangers and foreigners as themselves. Hence it appears that the name of neighbor is not confined to 				  our kindred, or such other persons with whom we are nearly connected, but extends to the whole human race; as Christ shows in the person of the Samaritan, who had compassion on an unknown man, and performed towards him the duties of humanity neglected by a Jew, and even a Levite.

By the word person is meant either splendor, or obscurity, and outward appearance, as it is commonly called, as we gather from many passages.

For the corruption which tends to the subversion of judgments, or, by undermining rectitude, vitiates all contracts, leaves nothing in security; whilst deception in weights and measures destroys and sweeps away all legitimate modes of dealing. Now, if the laws of buying and selling are corrupted, human society is in a manner dissolved; so that he who cheats by false weights and measures, differs little from him who utters false coin: and consequently one, who, whether as a buyer or 				  seller, has falsified the standard measures of wine or corn, or anything else, is accounted criminal.   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">103</FONT></A>

But although this pestilent sin is by no means to be endured, but 				  to be severely punished, still God, even if legal punishments be not inflicted, summons men&#8217;s consciences before His tribunal, and this he does both by promises and threats. A just weight (He says) and a just measure shall prolong a man&#8217;s life; but he who has been guilty of deception in them, is an abomination before me. Length of life, indeed, has only a figurative connection with just weights and measures: but, because the avaricious, in their pursuit of dishonest gain, are too devoted to 				  this transitory life, God, in order to withhold His people from this blind and impetuous covetousness, promises them long life, if they keep themselves from fraud and all knavish dealings.

 				   ) in requiring pledges, whereby the poor are often exceedingly distressed. In the first place, He prohibits the taking of anything in pledge which is necessary to the poor for the support of existence; for by the words which I have translated <i>meta</i> and <i>catillus</i>, <i>i</i> <i>e</i>., the upper and nether millstone, He designates by <i>synecdoche</i> all other instruments, which workmen cannot do without in earning their daily bread. As if any one should forcibly deprive a husbandman of his plough, or his spade, or harrow, or other tools, or should empty a shoemaker&#8217;s, or potter&#8217;s, or other person&#8217;s shop, who could not exercise his trade when deprived of its implements; and this is 				  sufficiently clear from the context, where it is said, &#8220;He taketh a man&#8217;s life to pledge,&#8221; together with his millstones. He, then, is as cruel, whosoever takes in pledge what supports a poor man&#8217;s life, as if he should take away bread from a starving man, and thus his life itself, which, as it is sustained by labor, so, when its means of subsistence are cut off, is, as it were, itself destroyed.</p>  				
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p27"></A><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p27.1"></A></p>  				
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p28"></A><b>10. </b><i>When thou dost lend thy brother anything</i>  He provides against another iniquity in reclaiming a pledge, viz., that the creditor should ransack the house and furniture of his brother, in order to pick out the pledge at his pleasure. For, if this option were given to the avaricious rich, they 				  would be satisfied with no moderation, but would seize upon all that was best, as if making an assault on the very entrails of the poor: in a word, they would ransack men&#8217;s houses, or at any rate, whilst they contemptuously refused this or that, they would fill the wretched with rebuke and shame. God, therefore, will have no pledge reclaimed, except what the debtor of his own accord, and at his own convenience, shall bring out of his house, lie even proceeds further, that the creditor shall not 				  take back any pledge which he knows to be necessary for the poor: for example, if he should pledge the bed on which he sleeps, or his counterpane, or cloak, or mantle. For it is not just that lie should be stripped, so as to suffer from cold, or to be deprived of other aids, the use of which he could not forego without loss or inconvenience. A promise, therefore, is added, that this act of humanity will be pleasing to God, when the poor shall sleep in the garment which is restored to him. He 				  speaks even more distinctly, and says: The poor will bless thee, and it shall be accounted to thee for righteousness. For God indicates that He hears the prayers of the poor and needy, lest the rich man should think the bounty thrown away which lie confers upon a lowly individual. We must, indeed, be more than iron-hearted, unless we are disposed to such liberality as this, when we understand that, although the poor have not the means of repaying us in this world, still they have the power of 				  recompensing us before God, <i>i</i> <i>e</i>., by obtaining grace for us through their prayers. An implied threat is also conveyed, that if the poor man should sleep inconveniently, or catch cold through our fault, God. will hear his groans, so that our cruelty will not <i>be</i> unpunished. But if the poor man, upon whom we have had compassion, should be ungrateful, 				  yet, even though he is silent, our kindness will cry out to God; whilst, on the other hand, our tyrannical harshness will <i>suffice</i> to provoke God&#8217;s vengeance, although he who has been treated unkindly should patiently swallow his wrong. <i>To be unto righteousness</i>   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">108</FONT></A>
 				   is equivalent to being approved by God, or being an acceptable act; for since the keeping of the Law is true righteousness, this praise is extended to particular acts of obedience. Although it must be observed that this righteousness fails and vanishes, unless we universally fulfill whatever God enjoins. It is, indeed, a part of righteousness to restore a poor man&#8217;s pledge; but if a mall be only beneficent in this respect., whilst in other matters he robs his 				  brethren; or if, whilst free from avarice, he exercises violence, is given to lust or gluttony, the particular righteousness, although pleasing in itself to God, will not come into account. In fact, we must hold fast the axiom, that no work is accounted righteous before God, unless il, proceeds from a man of purity and integrity; whereas there is none such to be found. Consequently, no works are imputed unto righteousness, except because God deigns to bestow His gratuitous favor on believers. 				  In itself, indeed, it would be true, that whatever act of obedience to God we perform, it is accounted for righteousness, <i>i</i> <i>e</i>., if the whole course of our life corresponded to it, whereas no work proceeds from us which is not corrupted by some defect. Thus, we must fly to God&#8217;s mercy, in order that, being reconciled to us, He may also accept our work.</p>  				
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p30"></A>What he had previously prescribed respecting the poor, lie afterwards applies to widows alone, yet so as to recommend all poor persons to us under their name; and this we gather both from the beginning of the verse (17,) in which lie instructs them to deal fairly and justly with strangers and orphans, and also from the reason which is added, viz., that they should reflect that they were bondmen in the land of Egypt; for their 				  condition there did not suffer them proudly to insult the miserable; and it is natural that he should be the more affected with the ills of others who has experienced the same.

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-p19"></A>From these passages we learn that it is not enough to refrain from taking the goods of another, unless we also constantly exercise humanity and mercy in the relief of the poor. Heathen authors also saw this, although not with sufficient clearness, (when they declared  				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">109</FONT></A>
 				  ) that, since all men are born for the sake of each other, human society is not properly maintained, except by an interchange of good offices. Wherefore, that we may not defraud our neighbors, and so be accounted thieves in God&#8217;s sight, let us learn, according to our several means, to be kind to those who need our help; for liberality is a part of righteousness, so that he must be deservedly held to be unrighteous who does not relieve the necessities of his brethren when he can. 				  This is the tendency of Solomon&#8217;s exhortation, that</p>  				
<p class="SCRIPTURE28"><a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-p21"></A>&#8220;we should drink waters out of our own cistern,   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">110</FONT></A>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p7"></A><b>25. </b><i>If thou lend money to any of my people</i>  Humanity ought to be very greatly regarded in the matter of loans, especially when a person, being reduced to extremities, implores a rich man&#8217;s compassion; for this is, in. point of fact, the genuine trial of our charity, when, in accordance with Christ&#8217;s 				  precept, we lend to those of whom we expect no return. (<a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p7.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#035">Lu 6:35</a><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p7.1"></A>.) The question here is not as to usury, as some have falsely thought,   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">111</FONT></A>
 				   as if he commanded us to lend gratuitously, and without any hope of gain; but, since in lending, private advantage is most generally sought, and therefore we neglect the poor; and only lend our money to the rich, from whom we expect some compensation, Christ reminds us that, if we seek to acquire the favor of the rich, we afford in this way no proof of our charity or mercy; and hence lie proposes another sort of liberality, which is plainly gratuitous, in giving 				  assistance to the poor, not only because our loan is a perilous one, but because they cannot make a return in kind.</p>  				
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p9"></A>Before descending to speak of loans, God here adverts to poverty and distress, (<a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p9.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#035">Le 25:35</a><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p9.1"></A>,) whereby men&#8217;s minds may be disposed to compassion. If any one be afflicted with poverty, he commands us to relieve his necessity. He makes use, however, of a metaphor,  				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">112</FONT></A>
 				  that he who is tottering should be strengthened, as if by catching hold of his hand. What follows about the stranger and sojourner extends and amplifies, in my opinion, the previous sentence; as if it were said that, since humanity is not to be denied even to strangers, much more is assistance to be given to their brethren. For, when it pleased God that strangers should be permitted to inhabit the land, they were to be kindly treated  				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">113</FONT></A>
 				  according to the rights of hospitality; for to allow them to <i>live</i> is to make their condition just and tolerable. And thus God indirectly implies, that such unhappy persons are expelled and driven away, so as not to <i>live</i>, if they are oppressed by unjust burdens. This, then, is the sum of the first sentence, that the rich, who has the ability, should uplift the poor man who is failing, by his assistance, or should strengthen the tottering.</p>  				
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p12"></A>A precept is added as to lending without interest, which, although it is a political law, still depends on the rule of charity; inasmuch as it can scarcely happen but that the poor should be entirely drained by the exaction of interest, and that their blood should be almost sucked away. Nor had God any other object in view, except that mutual and brotherly affection should prevail amongst the Israelites. It is plain that this was a 				  part of the Jewish polity, because it was lawful to lend at interest to the Gentiles, which distinction the spiritual law does not admit. The judicial law, however, which God prescribed to His ancient people, is only so far abrogated as that what charity dictates should remain, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., that our brethren, who need our assistance, are not to be treated harshly. Moreover, since the wall of partition, which formerly separated Jew and Gentile, is now broken down, our condition is now 				  different; and consequently we must spare all without exception, both as regards taking interest, and any other mode of extortion; and equity is to be observed even towards strangers. &#8220;The household of faith.&#8221; indeed, holds the first rank, since Paul commands us specially to do good to them, (<a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010">Ga 6:10</a><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p12.1"></A>;) still the common society of the human race demands that we should not seek to grow rich by the 				  loss of others.</p>  				
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p13"></A>As touching the political law, no wonder that God should have permitted His people to receive interest, from the Gentiles, since otherwise a just reciprocity would not have been preserved, without which one party must needs be injured. God commands His people not to practice usury, and still lays the Jews alone, and not foreign nations, under the obligation of this law. In order, therefore, that equality (<i>ratio</i> 				  <i>analogica</i>) might be preserved, He accords  				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">114</FONT></A>
 				  the same liberty to His people which the Gentiles would assume for themselves; for this is the only intercourse that can be endured, when the condition of both parties is similar and equal. For when Plato  				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">115</FONT></A>
 				  asserts that usurers are not to be tolerated in a well-ordered republic, lie does not go further than to enjoin, that its citizens should abstain from that base and. dishonest traffic between each other.</p>  				
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text21"><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p16"></A><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p16.1"></A>The question now is, whether usury is evil in itself; and surely that which heathens even have detested appears to be by no means lawful to the children of God. We know that the name of usurer has everywhere and always been infamous and detested. Thus Cato,   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">116</FONT></A>
 				  <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p17.1"></A> desiring to commend agriculture, says that thieves were formerly condemned to a fine of double, and usurers quadruple; from which he infers, that the latter were deemed the worst. And when asked what he thought of usury, he replied, &#8220;What do I think of killing a man?&#8221; whereby he wished to show, that it was as improper to make money by usury as to commit murder. This was the swing of one private individual, yet it is derived from the opinions of almost all 				  nations and persons. And assuredly from this cause great tumults often arose at Rome, and fatal contentions were awakened between the common people and the rich; since it can hardly be but that usurers suck men&#8217;s blood like leeches. But if we come to an accurate decision as to the thing itself, our determination must be derived from nowhere else than the universal rule of justice, and especially from the declaration of Christ, on which hang the law and the prophets, &#8212; Do not unto others what ye 				  would not have done to thyself. (<a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p17.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#012">Mt 7:12</a><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p17.2"></A><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p17.3"></A>.) For crafty men are for ever inventing some little subterfuge or other to deceive God. Thus, when all men detested the word <i>foenus</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p17.4"></A>, another was substituted, which might avoid unpopularity under an honest pretext; for they called it <i>usury</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p17.5"></A>, 				  as being a compensation for the loss a man had incurred by losing the <i>use</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p17.6"></A> of his money. But   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">117</FONT></A>
 				  <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p18.2"></A> there is no description of <i>foenus</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p18.3"></A> to which this specious name may not be extended; for whosoever has any ready money, and is about to lend it, he will allege that it would be profitable to himself if he were to purchase   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">118</FONT></A>
 				  <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p19.1"></A> something with it, and that at every moment opportunities of gain are presenting themselves. Thus there will be always ground for his seeking compensation, since no creditor could ever lend money without loss to himself. Thus usury,   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">119</FONT></A>
 				  <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p20.1"></A> since the word is equivalent to <i>foenus</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p20.2"></A>, is but a covering for an odious practice, as if such glosses would deliver us in God&#8217;s judgment, where nothing but absolute integrity can avail for our <i>defense</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p20.3"></A>. There was almost a similar mode of subterfuge among the Israelites. The name <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p20.4"></A>&#1504;&#1513;5<a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p20.5"></A>, <i>neschec</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p20.6"></A>, which is derived from <i>biting</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p20.7"></A>, sounded badly; since then no one chose to be likened to a hungry dog, who fed himself by biting others, some escape from the reproach was sought; and they called whatever gain they received beyond the capital, <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p20.8"></A>&#1514;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;<a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p20.9"></A>, <i>therbith</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p20.10"></A>, as being an increase. But God, in order to prevent such deception, unites the two words, (<a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p20.11"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#036">Le 25:36</a><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p20.11"></A><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p20.12"></A>,) and condemns the increase as well as the biting. For, where He complains of their unjust modes of spoiling and thieving in Ezekiel,<a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p20.13"></A> 				    				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">120</FONT></A>
 				  <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p21.4"></A> and uses both words as He does here by Moses, there is no doubt but that He designedly cuts off their empty excuses. (<a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p21.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#013">Eze 18:13</a><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p21.5"></A><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p21.6"></A>.) Lest any, therefore, should reply, that although he derived advantage from his money, he was not on that account guilty of usury, God at once removes this pretense, and condemns in general any addition to the 				  principal. Assuredly both passages clearly show that those who invent new words in excuse of evil, do nothing but vainly trifle. I have, then, admonished men that the fact itself is simply to be considered, that all unjust gains are ever displeasing to God, whatever color we endeavor to give to it. But if we would form an equitable judgment, reason does not suffer us to admit that all usury is to be condemned without exception. If the debtor have protracted the time by false pretences to the 				  loss and inconvenience of his creditor, will it be consistent that he should reap advantage from his bad faith and broken promises? Certainly no one, I think, will deny that usury ought to be paid to the creditor in addition to the principal, to compensate his loss.   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">121</FONT></A>
 				  <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p22.1"></A> If any rich and monied man, wishing to buy a piece of land, should borrow some part of the sum required of another, may not he who lends the money receive some part of the revenues of the farm until the principal shall be repaid? Many such cases daily occur in which, as far as equity is concerned, usury is no worse than purchase. Nor will that subtle argument   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">122</FONT></A>
 				  <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p23.1"></A> of Aristotle avail, that usury is unnatural, <i>because</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p23.2"></A> money is barren and does not beget money; for such a cheat as I have spoken of, might make much profit by trading with another man&#8217;s money, and the purchaser of the farm might in the meantime reap and gather his vintage. But those who think differently, may object, that we must abide by God&#8217;s judgment, when He generally prohibits all usury to His people. I 				  reply, that the question is only as to the poor, and consequently, if we have to do with the rich, that usury is freely permitted; because the Lawgiver, in alluding to one thing, seems not to condemn another, concerning which He is silent. If again they object that usurers are absolutely condemned by David and Ezekiel, (<a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p23.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#005">Ps 15:5</a><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p23.3"></A><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p23.4"></A>; <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p23.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#013">Eze 18:13</a><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p23.5"></A><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p23.6"></A>,) I think that their declarations ought to be judged of by the rule of charity; and therefore that only those unjust exactions are condemned whereby the creditor, losing&#8217; sight of equity, burdens and oppresses his debtor. I should, indeed, be unwilling to take usury under my patronage, and I wish the name itself were banished from the world; but I do not dare to pronounce upon so important a point more 				  than God&#8217;s words convey. It is abundantly clear that the ancient people were prohibited from usury, but we must needs confess that this was a part of their political constitution. Hence it follows, that usury is not now unlawful, except in so far as it contravenes equity and brotherly union. Let each one, then, place himself before God&#8217;s judgment-seat, and not do to his neighbor what he would not have done to himself, from whence a sure and infallible decision may be come to. To exercise the 				  trade of usury, since heathen writers accounted it amongst disgraceful and base modes of gain, is much less tolerable among the children of God; but in what cases, and how far it may be lawful to receive usury upon loans, the law of equity will better prescribe than any lengthened discussions.</p>  				
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text21"><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p24"></A><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p24.1"></A>Let us now examine the words. In the first place, where we have translated the words, &#8220;Thou shalt not be to him as a usurer,&#8221;   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">123</FONT></A>
 				  <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p25.1"></A> there is some ambiguity in the Hebrew word <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p25.2"></A>&#1504;&#1513;5<a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p25.3"></A>, <i>nashac</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p25.4"></A>, for it is sometimes used generally for to <i>lend</i><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p25.5"></A>, without any ill meaning; but here it is undoubtedly applied to a usurer, who bites the poor; as also in <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p25.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#011">Ps 109:11</a><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p25.6"></A><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p25.7"></A>, &#8220;Let the usurer catch all that he hath.&#8221;   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="#fn_123"><FONT SIZE="1">124</FONT></A>
 				  <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p26.1"></A> The sum is, that the poor are to be liberally aided, and not to be oppressed by harsh exactions: and therefore immediately afterwards it is added, &#8220;neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.&#8221; When again He repeats, &#8220;And if thy brother be waxen poor,&#8221; etc., we see that reference is everywhere made to the poor; because, although sometimes those who possess large properties are ruined by usury, (as Cicero says that certain luxurious and prodigal persons ill his days 				  contended against usury with the fruits of their farms, because their creditors swallowed up the whole produce;   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">125</FONT></A>
 				   <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p27.1"></A>) still the poor alone, who had been compelled to borrow by want, and not by luxury, were worthy of compassion.</p>  				
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p28"></A>The third passage, however, admirably explains the meaning of God, since it extends usury to corn and wine, and all other articles. For many contracts were invented by artful men, whereby they pillaged the needy without ignominy or disgrace: and now-a-days no rapacity is more cruel than that which imposes a payment upon debtors, without any mention of usury; for instance, if a poor man should ask the loan of six measures of wheat, the 				  creditor will require seven to be repaid; or if the same thing should happen as regards wine.

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iv.ii.xii-p11"></A><b>5.</b> <i>And the Lord spoke unto Moses</i>. Although at the outset He seems to include all trespasses, yet we gather from the context that the precept only refers to things stolen or fraudulently withheld, that he, who is conscious of his guilt, should make reparation. It must be observed, however, that 				  the law relates to more secret thefts, which are not usually brought to justice: and on this account it is said, &#8220;If they have committed any sin after the manner of men, they must not seek for subterfuge from ordinary use and custom.&#8221; Although, therefore, they may have many companions, God declares that this will not avail for their excuse; and consequently commands them voluntarily to restore what they have fraudulently or wrongfully appropriated. He will treat hereafter of the punishment of 				  theft; He now only prescribes that, although no one shall bring the guilty parties to justice, and their crime may not be discovered, still they should diligently examine their consciences, and themselves ingenuously declare the secret transgression; and also make compensation for the loss conferred, since, without restitution, their confession would be but illusory. I now pass over what Moses adds, that, if no heir exists to whom the stolen goods may be restored, they should offer it to the 				  priest, because I have already expounded it: except that we gather frost thence, that a contamination is contracted by fraud and rapine, which is never purged unless the house is well cleared of the ill-gotten gain. But this offering was treated of amongst the laws of the priests:   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">128</FONT></A>
 				   now, with respect to the restitution, we must consider that the fifth part was superadded, not so much in order that he, who had suffered the loss, should be enriched, as that all should diligently beware of every offense, which they hear not only to be useless to themselves, but also to be productive of loss. Besides, when a man has been robbed, it is often of more consequence than this additional fifth part, that he should have been deprived of the use of his 				  property.</p>  <a name="ii.iv.ii.xiii"></A>

This kind of theft is the worst of all, when judges are corrupted either by bribes, or by affection, and thus ruin the fortunes which they ought to protect: for, since their tribunal is as it were sacred asylum, to which those 				  who are unjustly oppressed may fly, nothing can be more unseemly than that they should there fall amongst robbers.   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">129</FONT></A>
 				   Judges are appointed to repress all wrongs and offenses; if therefore they show favor to the wicked, they are harborers of thieves; than which there is no more deadly pest. And besides, since their authority excludes every other remedy, they are themselves like rob-hers with arms in their hands. The greater, therefore, their power of injury is, and the greater the damage committed by their unjust sentences, the more diligently are they to be warned to beware of 				  iniquity; and thus it was necessary to keep them in the path of duty by special instructions, lest they should conceal and encourage thievery by their patronage. Now, as avarice is the root of all evils, when it thus lays hold of the minds of judges, no integrity can continue to exist. But, since all utterly condemn this vice, even though they may be entirely under its influence, God speaks of it the more plainly and popularly, enjoining that judges should withhold their hands from every gift: 				  for there is no more fatal poison for the extinction of all uprightness, than when a judge suffers himself to be cajoled by gifts. Let those who accept gifts allege as much as they please that they still maintain their integrity, the fact itself clearly shows that they are venal, and seek their own pecuniary advantage when they are thus attracted by gain. Formerly it was enough to render judges infamous that they were called <i>nummarii</i>, 				  (moneyers.)   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">130</FONT></A>
 				   But it is superfluous to treat any further of this matter, since God cuts off all handles for subterfuge in a single sentence: &#8220;for gifts (He says) blind the eyes of him that seeth, and pervert the judgment of the righteous.&#8221; If, then, we acquiesce in His decision, there is no light of intelligence so bright but that gifts extinguish it, nor any probity so great but that they undermine it; in fact, gifts infect a sound mind before they soil the hand; I mean 				  those which a person receives in reference to the judgment of a cause; for there is no question here as to those gifts of mutual kindness which men reciprocate with each other. Thus, in the passage from <a name="ii.iv.ii.xiii-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#000">Deuteronomy 16</a><a name="ii.iv.ii.xiii-p13.1"></A>, before God speaks of gifts, He forbids that justice should be wrested., or men&#8217;s persons respected: whence we gather, that only those snares are condemned which are set to curry favor. It must be observed on the passage from Leviticus, that to <i>judge</i> <i>in</i> <i>righteousness</i> is contrasted with <i>respecting</i> <i>the</i> <i>person</i>: and consequently, as soon as the judge turns away his eyes ever so little from the cause itself, he forgets equity. Moreover, to wrest judgment is 				  equivalent to doing iniquity in judgment; but since injustice is not always openly manifested, but rather disguised by various artifices, after God in Leviticus has condemned corrupt and unjust judgments, He uses this word to wrest (<i>inclinandi</i>), in Deuteronomy, in order to dissipate all vain pretexts.</p>  <a name="ii.iv.ii.xiv"></A>

 				   By an emphatic repetition God inculcates that judges should study equity with inflexible constancy; nor is this done without cause, for nothing is more likely to happen than that men&#8217;s minds should be clouded by favor or hatred.

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.iv.ii.xv-p9"></A><b>6. </b><i>Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor</i>. Since laws are enacted to repress the vices which are of frequent occurrence, no wonder that God should put forward the case of the poor, to whom it often happens that they fail though their causes are good, both because they are without interest and are exposed to injury 				  through the contempt in which they are held, and also because they cannot contend with the rich in incurring expense. Justly, then, is provision made for their inferiority, lest the iniquity of judges should rob them of the little they possess. But the other point here referred to might appear superfluous, viz., that judges should not favor the poor, which very rarely takes place. It would also be incongruous that what God elsewhere prescribes and praises should here be reprehended. I reply, 				  that rectitude is so greatly pleasing to God, that the judge would in no wise be excusable, under whatever pretext he might decline from it ever so little, and that this is the intention of this precept. For, although the poor is for the most part tyrannically oppressed, still ambition will sometimes impel a judge to misplaced compassion, so that he is liberal at another&#8217;s expense. And this temptation is all the more dangerous, because injustice is done under the cloak of virtue. For, if a 				  judge only directs his attention to the poverty of the litigant, a foolish fear will at the same time insinuate itself lest his sentence should ruin the man whom he would wish to save; thus he will award to the one what belongs to the other. Sometimes the temerity, audacity, and obstinacy of the poor in commencing and prosecuting suits is greater than that of the rich; and when they despair of their cause, they are sure to have recourse to tears and lamentations, by which they deceive 				  incautious judges, who, forgetful of the cause itself, only consider how their misery and want is to be relieved. Besides, too, whilst they think little of the rich man&#8217;s loss, because he can easily bear it, they make no scruple of declining from equity in favor of the poor. But hence it better appears how greatly God is offended by the oppression of the poor, when He will not have even <i>them</i> befriended to the injury of the rich.</p>
