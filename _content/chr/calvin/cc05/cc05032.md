<span id="iii.ii-p3"></span>**18.** Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself.

<span id="iii.ii-p4"></span>**18.** Diliges proximum tuum sicut to

<span id="iii.ii-p7"></span>**18.** *Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself*<span id="iii.ii-p7.1"></span>. What every man’s mind ought to
be towards his neighbor, could not be better expressed in many pages
that in this one sentence. We are all of us not only inclined to love
ourselves more than we should, but all our powers hurry us away in this
direction; nay, <span id="iii.ii-p7.2"></span>φιλαυτία<span
id="iii.ii-p7.3"></span> (self-love) blinds us so much as to be the
parent of all iniquities. Since, therefore, whilst we are too much given
to love ourselves, we forget and neglect our brethren, God could only
bring us back to charity by plucking from our hearts that vicious
passion which is born with us and dwells deeply in us; nor, again, could
this be done except by transferring elsewhere the love which exists
within us. On this point no less has the dishonesty betrayed itself than
the ignorance and folly of those  <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184) <span id="iii.ii-p8.3"></span> who
would have the love of ourselves come first: “The rule (say they) is
superior to the thing regulated by it; and according to God’s
commandment, the charity which we should exercise towards others is
formed upon the love of ourselves as its rule.” As if it were God’s
purpose to stir up the fire which already burns too fiercely. Naturally,
as I have said, we are blinded by our immoderate self-love; and God, in
order to turn us away from this, has substituted our neighbors, whom we
are to love no less than ourselves; nor will any one ever perform what
Paul teaches us to be a part of charity, viz., that she “seeketh not her
own,” (<span id="iii.ii-p8.4"></span>[1Co
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#005)<span
id="iii.ii-p8.4"></span><span id="iii.ii-p8.5"></span>,) until he shall
have renounced himself.

<span id="iii.ii-p9"></span>Not only those with whom we have some
connection are called our *neighbors*, but all without exception; for
the whole human race forms one body, of which all are members, and
consequently should be bound together by mutual ties; for we must bear
in mind that even those who are most alienated from us, should be
cherished and aided even as our own flesh; since we have  <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185) seen elsewhere that sojourners and
strangers are placed in the same category (with our relations;  <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186) ) and Christ sufficiently confirms
this in the case of the Samaritan. (<span id="iii.ii-p11.1"></span>[Lu
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030)<span id="iii.ii-p11.1"></span>.)
