your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.

<span id="ii.xxii-p5"></span>**37.** Etiam contra me iratus est Jehova
propter vos, dicendo: Etiam tu non ingredieris illuc.

<span id="ii.xxii-p6"></span>**38.** But Joshua the son of Nun, which
standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him; for he
shall cause Israel to inherit it.

<span id="ii.xxii-p7"></span>**38.** Jehosua filius Nun, qui stat coram
te, ipse ingredietur illuc: ipsum robora, quandoquidem illam in
haereditatem distribuet Israeli.

<span id="ii.xxii-p10"></span>**37.** *Also the Lord was angry with me.*
It is in no cowardly spirit that he transfers to them the guilt of
unfaithfulness, which he had confessed for himself; but, since he had
only fallen in consequence of being overwhelmed by their obstinate
wickedness, he justly reproaches them with the fact that God was wroth
with him on account of their sin. If under this pretext he had attempted
to extenuate his guilt before God, or to substitute their criminality
for his own, he would have done nothing else than double the evil: but,
in reproving the people, he rightly and appropriately complained that
the cause of his sin had arisen from them. As if he had said that they
were so perverse that even he had been corrupted by them, and drawn into
association with their guilt and its punishment. He here, however, adds
respecting Joshua what he had before passed over in silence. His
appointment as successor to Moses served to encourage the people; for it
was a notable ground for hope that they should hear a provision already
made, that after the death of Moses they should not be destitute of a
leader, who would rule them under the auspices of God.

<span id="ii.xxii-p11"></span>Why God preferred this man to all others,
especially when Caleb is more highly praised elsewhere, is only known to
Himself. We know that He chooses according to His own will those whom He
destines to any charge, so that the dignity of men may depend upon His
gratuitous favor. “To stand before” a person is equivalent to being at
hand to do his bidding; and it seems that this was stated to be the
condition of Joshua, in order that the punishment might be more
manifest; inasmuch as, by an entire inversion, a successor is given to
Moses, who had been his servant.
