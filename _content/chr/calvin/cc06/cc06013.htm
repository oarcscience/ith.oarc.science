<p><a name="ii.xii-p7"></A><b>36.</b> Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the Lord.</p>

<p><a name="ii.xii-p9"></A><b>39.</b> Moreover, your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</p>

<p><a name="ii.xii-p14"></A><b>34.</b> <i>And the Lord heard the voice of your words.</i> I have shown elsewhere what is meant by God&#8217;s hearing, <i>i.e., </i>that nothing can be concealed from Him, but that tie will take account of and judge all our words and deeds And this is worthy 			 of our observation; for men would never dare to murmur against Him, unless they promised themselves impunity   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">75</FONT></A>
 			  from His not being present. Secondly, we learn from hence, that God, who is a just Judge, does not proceed hastily and without cause to inflict punishment on men, and that He does not manifest severity without a full examination of the case. He, therefore, means that they deprived themselves of their assured inheritance, when they were close upon receiving it, through their own rebellion and depravity.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xii-p16"></A><a name="ii.xii-p16.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xii-p17"></A><b>39.</b> <i>Moreover, your little ones.</i> I have already shown that God so tempered His judgment that, whilst none of the guilty should escape with impunity, still His faithfulness should remain sure and inviolable, and that the wickedness of men should not make void the covenant which He had 			 made with Abraham. He, therefore, pronounces sentence upon them, that they should never enjoy the inheritance which they had despised: yet declares that He will nevertheless be true in the fulfillment of what He had promised, and will display His mercy towards their children, whom in their despair they had condemned to be a prey to their enemies.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xii-p18"></A>When He limits this grace to their little ones, whose age did not yet allow them to discern between good and evil, He signifies that all who had already arrived at the years of reason, were, from the least to the greatest, accomplices in the crime, since the contagion had spread through the whole body. Surely it was an incredible prodigy, that so great a multitude should be so carried away by diabolical fury, as that nothing should remain 			 unaffected by it, unless perhaps a timely death removed some of the old men rather on account of the vice of others than their own. But, if even a hundredth part of them had been guiltless of the crime, God would have left some survivors.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xii-p19"></A>&#8220;To have no knowledge of good and evil,&#8221; is equivalent to being unable &#8220;to discern between their right hand and their left hand;&#8221; by which expression in Jonah, (<a name="ii.xii-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011">Jon 4:11</a><a name="ii.xii-p19.1"></A>,) God exempts from condemnation those little ones, who have as yet no power of forming a judgment. From hence, however, some have foolishly attempted to prove that infant-children are not 			 defiled by original sin; and that men are involved in no guilt, except such as they have severally contracted by their own voluntary act <i>(arbitrio.) </i>For the question here is not as to the nature of the human race; a distinction is simply made between children and those who have consciously and willfully provoked God&#8217;s wrath; whereas the corruption, which is the root (of all evils,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">76</FONT></A>
 			 ) although it may not immediately produce its fruit in actual sins, is not  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">77</FONT></A>
 			 therefore non-existent.</p>
