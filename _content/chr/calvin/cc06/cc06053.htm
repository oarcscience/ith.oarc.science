<p><a name="ii.lii-p9"></A><b>21.</b> <i>Furthermore, the Lord was angry with me.</i> He again records that it arose from the transgression of the people that he was not permitted to enter the land, not by way of expostulation, and much less in order to accuse God of cruelty, as if he had been improperly and unjustly substituted 			 as a criminal in the place of others, but rather to magnify the goodness of God towards those whom He had treated with so much indulgence. For we must observe the comparison, that, whilst they were to enjoy the land, he was to be prevented from entering it. &#8220;I must die (he says) in this land&#8221; of Moab, whilst to you it is given to enjoy the promised inheritance. We perceive, therefore, that they are upbraided with their guilt in such a way that all the bitterness of the reproof is sweetened by 			 the sense of God&#8217;s mercy; nay, that by this sweetness they may be ravished into admiration, when they understand how mercifully that pardon is extended to them, which was denied to Moses.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.lii-p10"></A>The sense of the expression which I have rendered &#8220;for your words,&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_240"></A><A HREF="#fn_240"><FONT SIZE="1">241</FONT></A>
 			  might be &#8220;for your things,&#8221; inasmuch as the Hebrews call men&#8217;s affairs (<i>negotia</i>), <a name="ii.lii-p11.2"></A>&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;<i>, debarim. </i>Assuredly, although he had been impelled to sin by their rebellious clamors, he simply states that he was now punished on their account. If any should inquire why he lays the blame on them, 			 whereas the actual offenders were most of them dead, the reply is obvious, that many of them were still surviving, and that it is no novelty that the children should be included with the fathers, when the whole body of a people has sinned.</p>
