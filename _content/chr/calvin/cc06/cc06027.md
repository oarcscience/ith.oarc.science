<span id="ii.xxvi-p4"></span>**38.** And Aaron the priest went up into
mount Hor, at the commandment of the Lord, and died there, in the
fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of
Egypt, in the first day of the fifth month.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p5"></span>**38.** Ascendit autem Aharon sacerdos in
Hor montem secundum sermonem Jehovae: et mortuus est ibi anno
quadragesimo ex quo egressi sunt filii Israel e terra AEgypti, mense
quinto, primo die mensis.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p6"></span>**39.** And Aaron was an hundred and twenty
and three years old when he died in mount Hor.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p7"></span>**39.** Erat Aharon natus centum ac viginti
tres annos quando mortuus est in Hor monte.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p10"></span>**39.** *And Aaron was an hundred and
twenty and three years old.* It is not without reason that the great age
of Aaron is expressly stated, inasmuch as his life had been prolonged to
an unusual period, for the good of the people. At the age of an hundred
he had already exceeded the ordinary extent of life; whereas, by God’s
extraordinary blessing, he survived until the people were about to pass
into the promised land. Hence their ingratitude was the more base in not
acknowledging this paternal *care* of God, since it was for their
advantage that He preserved so long the minister of His grace.
