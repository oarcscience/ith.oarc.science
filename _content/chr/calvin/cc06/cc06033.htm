<p><a name="ii.xxxii-p61"></A><b><a name="ii.xxxii-p61.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#021">Numbers 21:21</a><a name="ii.xxxii-p61.1"></A>.</b> <i>And Israel sent messengers.</i> The second narration, which I have subjoined from Deuteronomy, is the fuller; nevertheless, a question arises from it, for what reason this embassy was sent to king Sihon, whose kingdom was already devoted to the 			 Israelites: for it seems to be altogether inconsistent to offer conditions of peace when war is decreed. God commands His people to take up arms: He declares that they shall be victorious, so as to occupy the land of Sihon by right of war; what, then, can be more absurd than to request of him that they might pass through his land in peace? If this attempt were made by Moses without the command of God, such an excess of kindness was not devoid of guilt, inasmuch as it was an act of much temerity 			 to promise what God had appointed otherwise. But, if we should say that the messengers went with the authority, and at the command of God, under what pretext shall the deceptiveness of the act be excused? for it is very improper to flatter with soothing words and promises those whom you have destined to destruction. The conclusion I come to is, that although the event was not unknown to God, still the embassy was sent, nevertheless, by his command and decree, in order to lay open the obstinate 			 ferocity of the nation. But, since the secret judgments of God far surmount our senses, let us learn to reverence their height; and let this sober view restrain our boldness like a rein, viz., that although the reason for the works of God be unknown to us, still it always exists with Him. God knew that the messengers would speak to the deaf, and yet it is not in vain that He bids them go; for, since the kingdom of Sihon was not properly included in the promised land, it was not lawful for the 			 children of Israel to make war upon it until they had been provoked by an unjust refusal. Thus, then, I connect the history. Before they had been assured at God&#8217;s command of the event, and the victory, they sent the messengers, who demanded that a pacific passage should be accorded to them; and that then the permission to have recourse to arms was granted. If any prefer to think that, before Moses attempted to preserve peace, he had been made acquainted with all that would occur, I will not 			 contend the point; but I deem it more probable that he had expectations of the peace which he sought, because the judgment of God had not yet been declared. If, therefore, Sihon had allowed himself to be propitiated, Moses would never have dared to deal with him as an enemy; but, he rather simply and honestly promised peace, which he intended to preserve; God, however, had otherwise appointed, as the event presently shewed. Still He was not inconsistent with Himself, or variable, in sending the 			 messengers to an irreclaimable and obstinately perverse man; for thus was all excuse taken away when he had voluntarily provoked to war a people who were ready and willing to maintain peace and equity. But rather may we see in this history, as in a glass, that, whilst God earnestly invites the reprobate to repentance and the hope of salvation, He has no other object than that they may be rendered inexcusable by the detection of their impiety. Hence is their ignorance refuted, who gather from 			 this that it is free for all promiscuously to embrace God&#8217;s grace, because its promulgation <i>(doctrina) </i>is common, and directed to all without exception; as if God was not aware of what Sihon would answer when He would have him attracted to equity by friendly and peaceful words; or as if, on his free will, the purpose of God was suspended as to the war, which was soon after carried forward by His decree.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxxii-p62"></A>But inasmuch as what is here briefly recorded, would be obscure in itself, we must explain it by the other narrative, where it is thus written, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ii.xxxii-p63"></A><a name="ii.xxxii-p63.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxxii-p64"></A><b><a name="ii.xxxii-p64.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024">Deuteronomy 2:24</a><a name="ii.xxxii-p64.1"></A>.</b> <i>Rise ye up, take your journey.</i> I have lately said that the order is here inverted, for what soon after follows, &#8220;And I sent messengers out of the wilderness,&#8221; etc., <a name="ii.xxxii-p64.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026">De 2:26</a><a name="ii.xxxii-p64.2"></A>, Moses, in my opinion, has inserted by way of parenthesis: it will, therefore, be suitably rendered in the pluperfect tense, &#8220;But I had sent,&#8221; etc. Thus there will be no ambiguity in the sense that, when the messengers had returned without effecting their purpose, God sustained the weariness of the people by this consolation, as though he 			 had said, Sihon has not, with impunity, repudiated the peace offered to him, since it will now be permitted you to assail him in lawful war. And assuredly this signal for the expedition to advance depends on the declaration which is subjoined in <a name="ii.xxxii-p64.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#030">De 2:30</a><a name="ii.xxxii-p64.3"></A>, as we may readily gather from the context; for Moses there repeats what we here read respecting their passage in somewhat 			 different words; and again does God testify that He has given Sihon into the hands of the people, and exhorts Moses to go down boldly to the battle. Moreover, the cause is there specified why (Sihon) had been so arrogant and contemptuous in his rejection of the embassy, viz., because God had &#8220;hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate.&#8221; From whence again it appears how poor is the sophistry of those who imagine that God idly regards from 			 heaven what men are about to do.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">128</FONT></A>
 			  They dare not, indeed, despoil Him of foreknowledge; but what can be more absurd than that He foreknows nothing except what men please? But Scripture, as we see, has not placed God in a watch-tower, from which He may behold at a distance what things are about to be; but teaches that He is the director <i>(moderatorem) </i>of all things; and that He subjects to His will, not only the events of things, but the designs and 			 affections of men also. As, therefore, we have before seen how the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, so now Moses ascribes to God the obstinacy of king Sihon. How base a subterfuge is the exception which some make as to His <i>permission, </i>sufficiently appears from the end which Moses points out.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">129</FONT></A>
 			  For why did God harden the heart of Sihon? thalt &#8220;He might deliver him into the hand&#8221; of His people to be slain; because He willed that he should perish, and had destined his land for the Israelites. If God only permitted Sihon to grow hardened, this decree was either nought, or mutable, and evanescent, since it depended on the changeable will of man. Putting aside, then, all childish trifling, we must conclude that 			 God by His secret inspiration moves, forms, governs, and draws men&#8217;s hearts, so that even by the wicked He executes whatever He has decreed. At the same time it is to be observed that the wicked are not impelled to hardness of heart by extrinsic force, but that they voluntarily harden themselves; so that in this same hardness of heart God may be seen to be a just judge, however incomprehensible His counsel may be, and however the impiety of men may betray itself, who are their own instigators, 			 and the authors of their own sin. Emphatically does Moses inculcate the same thing twice over, viz., that the spirt of Sihon was hardened by God, and his heart made obstinate, in order that God&#8217;s paternal favor towards His chosen people might be more conspicuous; because from the obstinacy of the blinded king He afforded them a just cause for war, and an opportunity for victory.</p>

<p><a name="ii.xxxii-p68"></A><b><a name="ii.xxxii-p68.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#025">Numbers 21:25</a><a name="ii.xxxii-p68.1"></A></b>  <i>And Israel took all these cities.</i> As if speaking of something present, he uses the demonstrative pronoun, and says, &#8220;these cities,&#8221; just as if he were pointing them out 			 to the eyes of his readers. The word which we have rendered &#8220;towns&#8221; <i>(oppida,)</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">130</FONT></A>
 			  others translate &#8220;country-houses&#8221; <i>(villas,) </i>or &#8220;hamlets&#8221; <i>(viculos.) </i>In the Hebrew, Moses calls by the name of &#8220;daughters&#8221; all the villages and lesser towns, whose mother-city <i>(metropolis) </i>was Heshbon. By these words, however, Moses indicates 			 that, by the right of war, all these places had fallen into the hands of the Israelites, as the lot of their inheritance; for, as I have lately said, God had not yet openly declared that they should be masters of this part of the country. They would consequently have over-passed their boundaries, unless these had been added to the land of Canaan. This is the reason why God openly declares that they possessed them by His authority. But when he says that the cities were destroyed, and all their 			 inhabitants exterminated, so that neither women nor children were spared, let us understand that they dealt not thus cruelly of their own impulse, or in heedless violence, but that whatsoever was on the other side of Jordan was devoted to destruction by God, that they might always have their minds fixed on the promised land, and might never give way to listlessness, which would have been the case if an easy occupation of it had invited them to repose. Although, therefore, God delivered over the 			 land to them hereafter, and suffered them to enrich themselves with its booty and spoils, yet He would not have it retained as a place of residence, and therefore commanded them to destroy its cities and villages, in order that they might seek their rest elsewhere. In fine, since they were abundantly disposed to be slothful, it was expedient that all snares should be removed, and that by the very desolation they might be urged forward whither God called them.</p>

<p><a name="ii.xxxii-p71"></A><b>26.</b> <i>For Heshbon was the city of Sihon.</i> It is not without cause that Moses relates how the country near Heshbon had passed into the hands of the Amorites, because a long time afterwards this was sought for as a pretext for war by the Ammonites, when they saw that the people were 			 brought into a low estate. In the time of Jephthah, therefore, having collected a great army, an irruption was made by them; and they made this their excuse, that they took up arms to recover what was their own, from Arnon as far as Jabbok, and as far as Jordan. Consequently, God would have it testified in the sacred records, as Jephthah then replied to the Ammonites, that this part of the land was taken from king Sihon, when the children of Israel were marching peacefully through the borders 			 of the Ammonites. Designedly, then, did Moses, in order to sanction the right of the people, insert in these authentic registers, as it were, what had formerly occurred, namely, that the Amorites had had the dominion over that part of the country, without interference from the Ammonites; nor was there any question that the Amorites had secure and peaceful possession of it. Hence it follows that it passed to the Israelites, so that there were no grounds why, three hundred years afterwards, the 			 Ammonites should reclaim what had so long been lost and abandoned by them. And, in order that posterity might know that there was then no obscurity about the matter, he records an ancient canticle, from which it appears that the Ammonites were so completely overcome, that their enemies triumphed magnificently over them, and cut off all hope of their restoration. Here, however, the question arises, why the king of Ammon, rather than the king of Moab, set on foot that war; for we clearly gather 			 from the song, that the land was taken from the Moabites. But for men who are bent on rapine and robbery, it is sufficient to allege any trivial pretext, and often to glory in the rights of others. There doubtless remained a report that the Amorites had been driven out of their territories,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">131</FONT></A>
 			  which they had obtained by force of arms. The Ammonites pass over in silence what had been forgotten in the lapse of many ages, and set up this false title, that, although the Israelites had conquered the Amorites, still their victory conferred upon them no right to occupy what the Amorites unjustly and forcibly held. With this object Moses inserted the account he here gives.</p>

<p><a name="ii.xxxii-p74"></A><b>27.</b> <i>Wherefore, they that speak in proverbs.</i> That is, an old saying, or proverbial sentence remains, and is well known. The song, however, appears to have been composed in the character of those who, when prepared to engage in war, mutually exhorted each other, &#8220;Come into Heshbon,&#8221; 			 i.e., run to the standard of king Sihon; hasten to his home, and his chief place of abode, in order that we may thence go forth to battle. These expressions, &#8220;build and prepare,&#8221; I interpret as being used for enlarge, adorn, and enrich; for it is probable that this city was not overthrown, but they foretell that the city would be renovated, when a larger dominion had been gained. And this is more fully confirmed by what immediately follows, when 			 it is said that &#8220;a fire had gone forth from Heshbon,&#8221; which consumed Ar of Moab, and all its neighborhood. As to the &#8220;lords of the high places of Arnon,&#8221; some understand the priests who presided in the temples; others extend them to all the inhabitants in general; but, in my opinion, it will not be unsuitable to refer them to the idols themselves, since it appears from the next verse that the conquerors were so insolently elated, as not only to 			 despise the men themselves, but their gods also; for when they say, &#8220;Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh,&#8221; there is no doubt but that they mockingly reproach them with the fact that they had been badly defended by the gods whom they worshipped.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">132</FONT></A>
 			  And, in point of fact, ungodly men, when in prosperity, uplift their horns to heaven, as if they would assail the divinity which was opposed to them. They, therefore, deride Chemosh, because he made &#8220;his sons&#8221; or worshippers to be fugitives or captives.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxxii-p76"></A>In the word <i>lantern</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">133</FONT></A>
 			  he makes use of a common metaphor. Some follow the Chaldee interpreter, and render it <i>kingdom; </i>but it has a wider signification; for it includes all the component parts of a happy and prosperous state.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">134</FONT></A>
 			 The meaning, therefore, is, that their glory and all their wealth was annihilated. The cities of Dibon and Medeba are situated on the extreme borders, near the river Arnon, so that by these he designates all the intermediate plain.</p>
