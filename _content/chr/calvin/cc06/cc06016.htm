<p><a name="ii.xv-p5"></A><b>23.</b> Likewise, when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xv-p6"></A><b>23.</b> Et quum misisset vos Jehova de Cades Barnea, dicendo: Ascendite, et possidete terram quam dedi vobis, rebellastis verbo Jehovae Dei vestri, neque credidistis ei, neque obedivistis voci ejus.</p>

<p><a name="ii.xv-p10"></A><b>22.</b> <i>And at Taberah.</i> He briefly adverts to several cases whereby he may convince the people of ingratitude and persevering obstinacy, and thus of a corrupt nature: for it is just as if he had said, that they had been rebellious against God not once only, nor in one particular way, but that 			 they had heaped together many offences, so that it was wonderful that God had so often pardoned them. He also recounts the names given to the places as memorials of their sins, in order that they may at length cease to transgress, since, although so often provoked, God had borne with them already too long.</p>
