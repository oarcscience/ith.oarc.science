<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p8"></A><b>6.</b> <i>And the children of Israel.</i> Since it is not the design of Moses to specify the stations here, as he does in <a name="ii.xxvii-p8.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#000">Nu 33</a><a name="ii.xxvii-p8.1"></A>, but only to mark the place in which Aaron died, I have 			 therefore thought fit to connect what we read here with the preceding narrative. In the death of Aaron, they might recognize the punishment of their own rebellion. But that Eleazar should be substituted in his place, was a sign of the paternal grace of God, who did not suffer them to be deprived of this blessing. This succession, too, was to be a perpetual rule for the future, so that the sacerdotal dignity, according to God&#8217;s prescription, should remain in that family.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p9"></A>He here specifies the names of certain places, which he omits in the passage above cited; for he there states that the Israelites went straight from Kadesh-barnea to Mount Hor; and then makes them pass on to Zalmonah and Punon, perhaps because the places had different names, or because they did not pitch their camp in Gudgodah, or Jotbath; although the advantages of the spot might have invited them to stop in a well-watered valley, for it is 			 called &#8220;the land of torrents,&#8221; through which an abundance of water flowed.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p10"></A>I do not advert to what every reader will readily observe for himself, that in the discourse of Moses the order of the history is inverted; for he says that the Levites were separated from the rest of the people, after the death of Aaron.</p>
