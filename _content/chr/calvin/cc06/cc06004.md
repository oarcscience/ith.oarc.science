<span id="ii.iii-p3"></span>**36.** And when the cloud was taken up from
over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their
journeys:

<span id="ii.iii-p4"></span>**36.** Quum recederet nubes a tabernaculo,
proficiscebantur filii Israel in cunctis profectionibus suis:

<span id="ii.iii-p5"></span>**37.** But if the cloud were not taken up,
then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.

<span id="ii.iii-p6"></span>**37.** Quod si non recederet nubes, non
proficiscebantur usque ad diem qua recedebat.

<span id="ii.iii-p7"></span>**38.** For the cloud of the Lord was upon
the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all
the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.

<span id="ii.iii-p8"></span>**38.** Quia nubes Jehovae erat super
tabernaculum interdiu, ignis vero noctu in eo, coram oculis totius domus
Israel, in cunctis profectionibus eorum.

<span id="ii.iii-p9"></span><span id="ii.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii-p10"></span>**38.** *For the cloud of the Lord was on
the tabernacle.* Moses more distinctly explains what he had said
generally respecting the cloud, viz., that by night a fiery column
appeared, because the cloud would not have been visible amidst the
darkness. A second explanation is also added, that this did not happen
once or twice only, but “in all their journeys;” so that they were never
without a sight of the cloud, which might be a witness of God’s
presence, whether, being settled on the tabernacle, it commanded them to
rest, or, by its ascension, gave them the sign for removing the camp.
Now, the equability of this proceeding, in all the variety of times and
marches, did not a little conduce to certainty; for, if the cloud had
daily accomplished the same course, this very regularity would have
obscured the power’ of God; but when for a whole year it did not move,
and then frequently proceeded to a new place, and now by its. guidance
pointed out a longer journey, now a shorter one, by this very diversity
the paternal care of God, who was never unmindful of His people, more
conspicuously manifested itself.
