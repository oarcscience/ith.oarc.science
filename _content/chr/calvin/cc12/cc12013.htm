<p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN15"><a name="xiv-p1"></A>PSALM 130</p>  		
<p><a name="xiv-p2"></A>Whether the Prophet in this Psalm prays in his own name in particular, or represents the whole Church, it is manifest, that finding himself overwhelmed with adversities, he supplicates deliverance with passionate ardor. And while acknowledging that he is justly chastised by the hand of God, he encourages himself and all genuine believers to cherish good hope, since God is the everlasting deliverer of his people, and has always in readiness the 		  means of effecting their rescue from death.</p>

<p><a name="xiv.i-p5"></A><b>1.</b> <i>Out of the deep places have I cried to thee, O Jehovah!</i> It is to be noticed that the Prophet speaks of himself as sending forth his voice, as it were from out of a deep gulf,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">118</FONT></A>
 			  feeling himself overwhelmed with calamities. As the miseries to which there is no prospect of a termination commonly bring despair in their train, nothing is more difficult than for persons, when involved in grievous and deep sorrow, to stir up their minds to the exercise of prayer. And it is wonderful, considering that whilst we enjoy peace and prosperity we are cold in prayer, (because then our hearts are in a state of infatuated security, how in adversities, 			 which ought to quicken us, we are still more stupefied. But the Prophet derives confidence in coming to the time one of grace from the very troubles, cares, dangers and sorrow into which he was plunged. He expresses his perplexity and the earnestness of his desire both by the word cry, and by the repetition continued in the second verse. So much the more detestable then is the barbarous ignorance of the Papist&#8217;s, in shamefully profaning this Psalm by wresting; it to a purpose wholly foreign to 			 its genuine application. To what intent do they mumble it over for the dead, if it; is not that, in consequence of Satan having bewitched them, they may by their profanity extinguish a doctrine of singular utility? From the time that this Psalm was, by, a forced interpretation, applied to the souls of the dead, it is very generally believed to be of no use whatever to the living, and thus the world has lost an inestimable treasure.</p>

<p><a name="xiv.i-p8"></A><b>3.</b> <i>If thou, O God! shoudst mark iniquities</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">119</FONT></A>
 			  Here the Prophet acknowledges that although grievously afflicted he had justly deserved such punishment, as had been inflicted upon him. As by his own example he gives a rule which the whole Church ought to observe, let no man presume to intrude himself into the presence of <i>God, </i>but in the way of humbly deprecating his wrath; and 			 especially when God exercises severity in his dealings towards us, let us know that we are required to make the same confession which is here uttered. Whoever either flatters himself or buries his sins by inattention to them, deserves to pine away in his miseries; at least he is unworthy of obtaining from God the smallest alleviation. Whenever God then exhibits the tokens of his wrath, let even the man who seems to others to be the holies of all his fellows, descend to make this confession, 			 that should God determine to deal with us according to the strict demands of his law, and to summon us before his tribunal, not one of the whole human race would be able to stand. We grant that it is one man only who here prays, but he at once pronounces sentence upon the whole human race. &#8220;All the children of Adam,&#8221; he substantially says, &#8220;from the first to the last, are lost and condemned, should God require them to render up an account of their life.&#8221; It is therefore necessary that even the 			 holiest of men should pass under this condemnation, that they may betake themselves to the mercy of God as their only refuge. The Prophet does not however mean to extenuate his own fault by thus involving others with himself, as we see hypocrites do, who when they dare not altogether justify themselves, resort to this subterfuge, &#8220;Am I the first or the only man who has offended?&#8221; and thus, 			 mingling themselves with a multitude of others, they think themselves half absolved from their guilt. But the Prophet, instead of seeking to shelter himself under such a subterfuge, rather confesses, after having thoroughly examined himself, that if of the whole human race not even one can escape eternal perdition, this instead of lessening rather increased his obnoxiousness to punishment. Whoever, as if he had said, shall come into the presence of God, whatever may be his eminence for 			 sanctity, he must succumb and stand confounded,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">120</FONT></A>
 			  what then will be the case as to me, who am not one of the best? The right application of this doctrine is, for every man to examine in good earnest his own life by the perfection which is enjoined upon us in the law. In this way he will be forced to confess that all men without exception have deserved everlasting damnation; and each will acknowledge in respect to himself that he is a thousand times undone. Farther, 			 this passage teaches us that, since no man can stand by his own works, all such as are accounted righteous before God, are righteous in consequence of the pardon and remission of their sins. In no other manner can any man be righteous in the sight of God. Very differently do the Papists think. They indeed confess that the deficiencies of our works are supplied by the lenity which God exercises towards us; but at the same time they dream of a partial righteousness, on the ground of which men may 			 stand before God. In entertaining such an idea they go very far astray from the sense of the Prophet, as will appear more plainly from the sequel.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.i-p11"></A><a name="xiv.i-p11.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.i-p12"></A><b>4.</b> <i>But with thee there is forgiveness.</i> This verse leads us farther. Though all men confess with the mouth that there is no human being in the world whom God may not justly adjudge to everlasting death, should it so please him, yet how few are persuaded of the truth which the Prophet now 			 adds, that the grace of which they stand in need shall not be denied them? They either sleep in their sins through stupidity, or fluctuate amidst a variety of doubts, and, at length, are overwhelmed with despair. This maxim, &#8220;that no man is free from sin,&#8221; is, as I have said, received among all men without dispute, and yet the majority shut their eyes to their own faults, and settle securely in hiding &shy; places to which, in their ignorance, 			 they have betaken themselves, if they are not forcibly roused out of them, and then, when pursued close by the judgments of God, they are overwhelmed with alarm, or so greatly tormented as to fall into despair. The consequence of this want of hope in men, that God will be favorable to them, is an indifference about coming into the Divine presence to supplicate for pardon. When a man is awakened with a lively sense of the judgment of God, lie cannot fail to be humbled with shame and fear. Such 			 self-dissatisfaction would not however suffice, unless at the same time there were added faith, whose office it is to raise up the hearts which were cast down with fear, and to encourage them to pray for forgiveness. David then acted as he ought to have done when, in order to his attaining genuine repentance, he first summons himself before God&#8217;s judgment seat; but, to preserve his confidence from failing under the overpowering influence of fear, he presently adds the hope which there was of 			 obtaining pardon. It is, indeed, a matter which comes under our daily observation, that those who proceed not beyond the step of thinking themselves deserving of endless death, rush, like frenzied men, with great impetuosity against God. The better, therefore, to confirm himself and others, the Prophet declares that God&#8217;s mercy cannot be separated or torn away from himself. &#8220;As soon as I think upon thee,&#8221; he says in amount, &#8220;thy clemency also presents itself to my mind, so that I have no doubt 			 that thou wilt be merciful to me, it being impossible for thee to divest thyself of thy own nature: the very fact that thou art God is to me a sure guarantee that thou wilt be merciful &#8221; At the same time let it be understood, that he does not here speak of a confused knowledge of the grace of God, but of such a knowledge of it as enables the sinner to conclude with certainty, that as soon as he 			 seeks God he shall find him ready to be reconciled towards him. It is not therefore surprising that among the Papists there is no steady calling upon God, when we consider that, in consequence of their mingling their own merits, satisfactions, and worthy preparation &shy; as they term it &shy; with the grace of God, they continue always in suspense and doubt respecting their reconciliation with God. Thus it comes to pass, that by praying they only augment their own sorrows and torments, just as 			 if a man should lay wood upon a fire already kindled. Whoever would reap profit from the exercise of prayer, must necessarily begin with free remission of sins. It is also proper to mark the final cause &shy; as we say &shy; for which God is inclined to forgive, and never comes forward without showing himself easy to be pacified towards those who serve him; which is the absolute necessity of this hope of obtaining forgiveness, to the existence of piety, and the worship of God in the world. This 			 is another principle of which the Papists are ignorant. They, indeed, make long sermons   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">121</FONT></A>
 			  about the fear of God, but, by keeping poor souls in perplexity and doubt, they build without a foundation. The first step to the right serving of God unquestionably is, to submit ourselves to him willingly and with a free heart. The doctrine which Paul teaches concerning alms-deeds, <a name="xiv.i-p13.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007">2Co 9:7</a><a name="xiv.i-p13.3"></A>, that &#8220;God loveth a cheerful giver,&#8221; is to be extended 			 to all parts of the life. How is it possible for any man to offer himself cheerfully to God unless he rely upon his grace, and be certainly persuaded that the obedience lie yields is pleasing to him? When this is not the case all men will rather shun God, and be afraid to appear in his presence, and if they do not altogether turn their back upon him, they will catch at subterfuges. In short, the sense of God&#8217;s judgment, unless conjoined with the hope of forgiveness, strikes men with terror, 			 which must necessarily engender hatred. It is no doubt true, that the sinner, who, alarmed at the Divine threatenings, is tormented in himself, does not. despise God, but yet lie shuns him; and this shunning of him is downright apostasy and rebellion. Whence it follows, that men never serve God aright unless they know that he is a gracious and merciful being. The other reason to which I have adverted must also be remembered, which is, that unless we are assured that what we offer to God is 			 acceptable to him, we will be seized with indolence and stupidity which will keep us from doing our duty. Although unbelievers often show a great deal of earnestness, just as we see the Papists laboriously occupied with their superstitions, yet, from their not being persuaded that God is reconciled to them, they do not all the while render to him any voluntary obedience. Were they not held back by a slavish fear, the horrible rebellion of their heart, which this fear keeps hidden and 			 suppressed, would soon manifest itself externally.</p>  <a name="xiv.ii"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption19"><a name="xiv.ii-p1"></A><a name="xiv.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#005">Psalm 130:5-6</a><a name="xiv.ii-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p2"></A><b>5.</b> I have waited for Jehovah, my soul hath waited; and I have hoped in his word. <b>6.</b> My soul hath waited for the Lord before the watchers of the morning, idea, before the watchers of the mourning.</p> 				  			   		    		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p3"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.ii-p4"></A><a name="xiv.ii-p4.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p5"></A><b>5.</b> <i>I have waited for Jehovah.</i> After having testified in general that God is ready to show mercy to poor sinners who betake themselves to him, the Psalmist concludes that he is thereby encouraged to entertain good hope. The past tense in the verbs <i>wait </i>and <i>trust </i>is put for the present<i>. I have waited</i> for <i>I wait; I have hoped </i>for <i>I hope. </i>The repetition occurring in the first part of the verse is emphatic; and the word <i>soul </i>gives additional emphasis, implying, as it does, that the Prophet trusted in God even with the deepest affections of his heart. From this we also gather that he was not only patient and constant in the sight. of men, but that even in the inward feelings of his heart he had maintained quietness and patience before God; which is a very evident proof of faith. Many, no doubt, are restrained by vain glory from openly murmuring against God or betraying their distrust, but there is hardly 			 one in ten who, when removed from the inspection of his fellow-men, and in his own heart, waits for God with a quiet mind. The Psalmist adds, in the concluding clause, that what supported his patience was the confidence which he reposed in the divine promises. Were these promises taken away, the grace of God would necessarily vanish from our sight, and thus our hearts would fail and be overwhelmed with despair. Besides, he teaches us, that our being contented with the word of God alone affords 			 a genuine proof of our hope. When a man, embracing the word, becomes assured of having his welfare attended to by God, this assurance will be the mother of waiting or patience. Although the Prophet here speaks to himself for the purpose of confirming his faith, yet there is no doubt that he suggests to all the children of God like matter of confidence in reference to themselves. In the first place he sets before them the word, that they may depend entirely upon it; and next he warns them that 			 faith is vain and ineffectual unless it frame us to patience.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.ii-p6"></A><a name="xiv.ii-p6.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p7"></A><b>6.</b> <i>My soul hath waited for the Lord before the watchers of the morning.</i> In this verse he expresses both the ardor and the perseverance of his desire. In saying that he anticipated the watchmen, he shows by this similitude with what diligence and alacrity he breathed after God. And the 			 repetition is a proof of his perseverance; for there is no doubt that thereby he intended to express an uninterrnitted continuance of the same course, and consequently perseverance. Both these qualities in his exercise, are worthy of attention; for it is too manifest how slow and cold we are in elevating our minds to God, and also how easily we are shaken and even fall at every little blast of wind. Farther, as the watches of the night were in ancient times usually divided into four parts, this 			 passage may be explained as implying that as the watchmen of the night, who keep watch by turns, are careful in looking when the morning will dawn, so the Prophet looked to God with the greatest attention of mind. But the more natural sense seems to be, that as in the morning the warders of the gates are more wakeful than all other people, and are the earliest in rising, that they may appear at the posts assigned them, so the mind of the Prophet hastened with all speed to seek God. The 			 repetition, as I have already observed:, shows that he stood keeping his gaze perseveringly fixed upon its object. We must always beware of allowing our fervor to languish through the weariness of delay, should the Lord for any length of time keep us in suspense.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">122</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xiv.iii-p2"></A><b>7.</b> But let Israel hope in Jehovah; for with Jehovah there is mercy, and with him there is plenteous redemption. <b>8.</b> And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">123</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xiv.iii-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.iii-p5"></A><a name="xiv.iii-p5.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.iii-p6"></A><b>7.</b> <i>But let Israel hope in Jehovah.</i> After having spoken of himself, and exhibited in his own person an example for all to follow, he now applies the doctrine to the whole body of the Church. It is to be noticed that the foundation upon which he would have the hope of all the godly to 			 rest is the mercy of God, the source from which redemption springs. In the first clause he reminds them that although they bring with them no worth or merits of their own, it ought to suffice them that God is merciful. This mutual relation between the faith of the Church and the free goodness of God is to be attentively marked, to the end we may know that all those who, depending upon their own merits, persuade themselves that God will be their rewarder, have not their hope regulated according 			 to the rule of Scripture. From this mercy, as from a fountain, the Prophet derives redemption; for there is no other cause which moves God to manifest himself as the redeemer of his people but his mercy. He describes this redemption as <i>plenteous, </i>that the faithful, even when reduced to the last extremity, may sustain themselves from the consideration that there are in the hand of God many and incredible means by which to save them. This Psalm 			 may have been composed at a time when the Church was in so very afflicted a condition as might have discouraged one and all, had not the infinite greatness of the power of God served as a buckler to defend them. The true use of the present doctrine is, first, that the faithful, even when plunged in the deepest gulfs, should not doubt of their deliverance being in the hand of God, who, whenever necessity shall require, will be able to find means, which are now hidden and unknown to us; and, 			 secondly, that they should hold it as certain, that as often as the Church shall be afflicted he will manifest himself to be her deliverer. To this truth the sentence immediately following refers.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.iii-p7"></A><a name="xiv.iii-p7.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.iii-p8"></A><b>8.</b> <i>And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.</i> Here the Psalmist applies more closely to the Church what he has said in the preceding verse. He concludes that it is not to be doubted that God, who has it in his power to save by multiplied means, will prove himself the deliverer 			 of the people whom he has chosen. By these words he teaches us, that when we have evidence of our being adopted by God, we ought also to regard our salvation as certain. His meaning might be explained more familiarly in this way: As to redeem is the continual office of God, and as he is not the redeemer of all men indiscriminately, but only of his chosen people, there is no reason for apprehending that the faithful will not emerge from all calamities; for were it otherwise, God would cease to 			 execute the office which he claims to himself. He repeats the sentiment of the preceding verse, that, provided Israel with all humility draw near to God to plead for pardon, his sins will not be an obstacle in the way of God&#8217;s showing himself his redeemer. Although the Hebrew word, <a name="xiv.iii-p8.1"></A>&#1506;&#1493;&#1503;<i>, avon, </i>is often put for the punishment of sin, yet it also contains a tacit 			 reference to the fault. Whenever, then, God promises a mitigation of the punishment, he at the same time gives assurance that he will pardon the sins; or rather in offering to sinners a gratuitious reconciliation, he promises them forgiveness. According to this exposition it is here said that he will redeem his Church, not from the captivity of Babylon, or from the tyranny and oppression of enemies, or from penury, or, in short, from any other disasters but from sin; for until God pardon the 			 sins of the men whom he afflicts, deliverance is not to be hoped for. Let us then learn from this passage in what way we are to expect deliverance from all calamities, or the order which it becomes us to observe in seeking it. Remission of sins always goes first, without which nothing will come to a favorable issue. Those who only desire to shake off the punishment are like silly invalids, who are careless about the disease itself with which they are afflicted, provided the symptoms which 			 occasion them trouble for a time are removed. In order, then, that God may deliver us from our miseries, we must chiefly endeavor to be brought to a state of favor with him by obtaining the remission of our sins. If this is not obtained, it will avail us little to have the temporal punishment remitted; for that often happens even to the reprobate themselves. This is true and substantial deliverance, when God, by blotting out our sins, shows himself merciful towards us. Whence, also, we gather, 			 that having once obtained forgiveness, we have no reason to be afraid of our being excluded from free access to, and from enjoying the ready exercise of, the loving&shy;kindness and mercy of God; for <i>to redeem from iniquity</i> is equivalent to moderating punishments or chastisements. This serves as an argument to disprove the preposterous invention of the Papists respecting 			 satisfactions and purgatory, as if God, in forgiving the fault, still reserved for a future time the execution of the punishment upon the sinner. If it is objected that the Lord sometimes punishes those whom he has already pardoned; in reply, I grant that he does not always, at the very moment in which he reconciles men to himself, show them the tokens of his favor, for he chastises them to render them circumspect for the future, but while he does this, he in the meantime fails not to moderate 			 his rigour. This, however, forms no part of the satisfactions by which the Papists imagine that they present to God the half of the price of their redemption. In innumerable passages of Scripture, where God promises to his people outward blessings, he always begins with a promise of the pardon of sin. It is therefore the grossest ignorance to say, that God does not remit the punishment till they have pacified him by their works. Moreover, while God&#8217;s intention in inflicting some punishments or 			 chastisements upon the faithful, is to. bring them to yield a more perfect obedience to his law, the Papists are mistaken in extending these punishments beyond death. But it is not wonderful to find them heaping together so many heathenish dreams, seeing they adhere not to the true and only way of reconciliation, which is, that God is merciful only to such as seek the expiation of their sins in the sacrifice of Christ. It is to be noticed that it is said <i>from all 			 iniquities, </i>that poor sinners, although they feel themselves to be guilty in many ways, may not cease to cherish the hope that God will be merciful to them.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xiv.ii-p8"></A> Some, as Street, Mant, Dr. Adam Clarke, French and Skinner, and Phillips, suppose that the allusion in this verse is to the watchings which the Priests and Levites in their turns exercised during the night in the Temple, (see <a name="xiv.ii-p8.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001">Ps 34:1</a><a name="xiv.ii-p8.1"></A>,) and especially to those officers of theirs who were appointed to watch for the first 				  dawn of day, in order that the morning sacrifice might be offered. &#8220;In the Talmudical Tract Tamid it is related, &#8216;The prefect said to them, Go and see if the time of slaying; have arrived; if it had arrived, the watcher calls out, <a name="xiv.ii-p8.2"></A>&#1489;&#1512;&#1511;&#1488;&#1497;, Coruscations.&#8217; Agreeably to this explanation of the verse is the rendering of the Chaldee, which is as follows: &#8220;My soul waits for the Lord, more than the 				  keepers of the morning vigils, which they observe for offering of the morning oblation.&#8221;<i> &shy; Phillips. </i>&#8220;The custom alluded to by the Targumist,&#8221; [or Chaldee,] says Street, &#8220;is mentioned in <a name="xiv.ii-p8.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#007">Ex 30:7</a><a name="xiv.ii-p8.3"></A>. &#8216;And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps he 				  shall burn incense upon it.&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;The similitude,&#8221; observes Mant, &#8220;<i>is </i>beautifully expressive of the eager impatience of the Psalmist; which is still further augmented by the repetition.&#8221;</p> 			 </P>
