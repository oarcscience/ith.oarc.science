<p><a name="v.i.i-p3"></A><b>1 </b>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah to Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo, the Prophet, saying &#8212;</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Very angry has Jehovah been with your fathers:</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Thou shalt therefore say to them, &#8212; Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, &#8212; Return ye to me, saith Jehovah of hosts; And I will return to you, saith Jehovah of hosts:</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Be ye not like your fathers, For cry to them did the former Prophets, saying, &#8212; Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, &#8212; &#8220;Return ye, I pray, from your evil ways, And from your evil works;&#8221; But they heard not, nor attended to me, Saith Jehovah.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Your fathers &#8212; where are they? And the Prophets &#8212; do they for ever live?</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p8"></A><b>6 </b>But my words and my statutes, Which I committed to my servants the Prophets, Have they not laid hold on your fathers? &#8212; When they returned, they said, &#8212; &#8220;As Jehovah of hosts had purposed to do to us According to our ways and our works, So hath he done to us.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p9"></A><b>7 </b>On the twenty-fourth of the eleventh month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah to Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo, the Prophet, saying, &#8212;</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p10"></A><b>8 </b>I saw by night, and behold a man riding on a red horse; and he stood among the myrtles in a low place; and after him were horses, red, variegated, and white.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p11"></A><b>9 </b>And I said, What are these, my Lord? And the Angel, who spoke with me, said to me, I will show thee what these are.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p12"></A><b>10 </b>And the Angel, who stood among the myrtles, answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p13"></A><b>11 </b>And they answered the angel of Jehovah, who stood among the myrtles, and said &#8212; &#8220;We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, the whole earth rests and is quiet.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p14"></A><b>12 </b>And the Angel of Jehovah answered and said, Jehovah of hosts! How long wilt thou not pity Jerusalem And the cities of Judah, Which thou hast despised these seventy years! (<b>42</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Then answered Jehovah the Angel, who spoke with me, with good words, with comfortable words.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p16"></A><b>14 </b>And the Angel, who spoke with me, said to me, Cry, saying, &#8212;&#8212; Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, &#8212; I am zealous for Jerusalem And for Sion, with great zeal: (<b>44</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p17"></A><b>15 </b>And with great anger am I angry With the nations which are quiet; For I was angry a little, And they helped on the evil.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p18"></A><b>16 </b>Therefore thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; I am turned to Jerusalem in compassions; My house shall be built in it, Saith Jehovah of hosts; And a line shall be extended over Jerusalem.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p19"></A><b>17 </b>Cry again, saying, &#8212; Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, &#8212; Yet wear out shall cities through abundance, (<b>51</b>) And Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, And will yet choose Jerusalem.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.i-p20"></A><b>18 </b>And I raised my eyes and saw, and behold four horns;</p>

<p><a name="v.i.ii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>and I said, Where art thou going? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, that I may see what is its breadth, and what is its length.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.ii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And behold the angel who was speaking with me, he went forth, and another angel went forth to meet him, and said to him,</p>

<p><a name="v.i.ii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>And I shall be to it, saith Jehovah, A wall of fire round about, And for glory shall I be in the midst of it</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.ii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Ho! Ho! flee ye From the land of the north, saith Jehovah: For to the four winds of heaven Have I scattered you, saith Jehovah. (<b>65</b>)</p>

<p><a name="v.i.ii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, After the glory hath he sent me To the nations with spoiled you: For he who touches you Touches the apple of his eye.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.ii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>For, behold, I shake my hand over them, And they shall be a prey to their servants; And ye shall know That Jehovah of hosts hath sent me.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.ii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Exult and rejoice, thou daughter of Zion; For behold I am coming, And will dwell in thy midst, saith Jehovah:</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.ii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>And join themselves shall many nations To Jehovah in that day; And they shall be to me a people, And I will dwell in the midst of thee; And thou shalt know, That Jehovah of hosts has sent me to thee:</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.ii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>And Jehovah will take Judah As his hereditary portion in the holy land; And he will yet choose Jerusalem. Be silent all flesh before Jehovah; Be silent all flesh before Jehovah; Fore roused he is from his holy habitation.</p>  <a name="v.i.iii"></A>

<p><a name="v.i.iii-p3"></A><b>1 </b>And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to oppose him.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.iii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>And Jehovah said to Satan, &#8212; Rebuke thee, Satan, let Jehovah; Yea, rebuke thee let Jehovah, Who has chosen Jehovah: Is not this a brand snatched from the fire!</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.iii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And Joshua was clad in sordid garments, and stood before the angel:</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.iii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>and he answered and said to those who stood before him, saying, Take the sordid garments from off him: and he said to him, See I have made to pass from thee thine iniquity, and I will clothe thee with new garments.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.iii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>And I said, Let them set a pure mitre on his head: and they set a mitre on his head when they had clothed him with garments; and the angel of Jehovah stood by:</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.iii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>And protest did the angel of Jehovah to Joshua, saying, &#8212;</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.iii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, If in my ways wilt thou walk, And my charge wilt thou keep, thou shalt then rule my house, And thou shalt also keep my courts; And I will give thee a free intercourse Among those who are present. (<b>94</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.iii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>Hear now, O Joshua! the high priest, Thou and thy associates who stand before thee; For men of wonder are these; For, behold, I will bring forth my servant, the Branch:</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.iii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>For, behold, the stone which I have set before Joshua, On that one stone are seven eyes; Behold, I will engrave its engraving, Saith Jehovah of hosts; And I will remove the iniquity Of that land in one day:</p>

<p><a name="v.i.iv-p4"></A><b>2 </b>And he said to me, What dost thou see? and I said, I see and behold a candlestick, all of gold, and a bowl on its top, and seven lamps on it, seven pourers to the seven lamps, which are on its top,</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.iv-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And two olive-trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and one on its left.</p>

<p><a name="v.i.iv-p7"></A><b>5 </b>And the angel who was speaking with me, answered and said to me, Knowest thou not? and I said, No, my Lord.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.iv-p8"></A><b>6 </b>And he answered and said to me, saying, Not by a host, and not by courage, But by my Spirit, (<b>110</b>) Saith Jehovah of hosts.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.iv-p9"></A><b>7 </b>What art thou, great mountain, Before Zerubbabel? &#8212; A plain: And he shall bring forth the top-stone, <i>With</i> shoutings, &#8220;Grace, grace to it.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.iv-p10"></A><b>8 </b>Then came the word of Jehovah to me, saying, &#8212;</p>

<p><a name="v.i.iv-p14"></A><b>12 </b>And I answered the second time and said, What are these two flowings of the olive-tree, which are between the two pipes of gold, which pour golden oil from themselves?</p>

<p><a name="v.i.v-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And he said to me, This is the curse which goeth forth over the face of the whole land; for every one who steals shall on this as on that side be punished, and every one who swears shall on this as on that side be punished. (<b>129</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.v-p6"></A><b>4 </b>I will bring it forth, saith Jehovah of hosts; and it shall come into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears by my name falsely; and it shall abide in the midst of his house and consume it, both its timber and its stones.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.v-p7"></A><b>5 </b>And the angel who had been speaking with me came forth and said to me, Raise now thine eyes, and see what this is that goeth forth.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.v-p8"></A><b>6 </b>And I said, What is this? And he said, This is a measure which goeth forth: he said also, This is their eye through all the earth.</p>

<p><a name="v.i.v-p11"></A><b>9 </b>And I raised my eyes and saw, and behold two women going forth, and wind in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork; and they raised up the measure between earth and heaven.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.v-p12"></A><b>10 </b>And I said to the angel who was speaking with me, Where do these carry the measure?</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.i.v-p13"></A><b>11 </b>And he said to me, To build for it a house in the land of Shinar; and it shall be set and fixed there on its own base.</p>  <a name="v.i.vi"></A>
