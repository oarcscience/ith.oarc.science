<p><a name="ix.xxxix-p10"></A><b><a name="ix.xxxix-p10.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#029">Mark 1:29</a><a name="ix.xxxix-p10.2"></A>.</b> <i>They came, with James and John, into the house of Simon and Andrew.</i> There is reason to conjecture, that Matthew does not relate this history in its proper order: for Mark expressly states, that there were only four disciples who attended Christ. 			 Besides, when he left the synagogue, he went straight to Peter&#8217;s house; which also shows clearly, that Matthew did not observe, with exactness, the order of time. The Evangelists appear to have taken particular notice of this miracle; not that, in itself, it was more remarkable, or more worthy of being recorded, than other miracles, &#8212; but because, by means of it, Christ gave to his disciples a private and familiar illustration of his grace. Another reason was, that the healing of one woman gave 			 occasion to many miracles, so that they came to him in great numbers, from every direction, to implore his assistance. A single word, in Luke&#8217;s narrative, presents to us more strikingly the power which Christ displayed; for he says, that <i>Simon&#8217;s mother-in-law was held by a GREAT</i> <i>fever.</i> It was a clearer and more affecting proof of divine power, that, in a moment, and by a single touch, he removed a strong and violent disease. He might have done it by the slightest expression of his will; but he <i>touched her hand,</i> <b>(</b><a name="ix.xxxix-p10.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#015">Mt 8:15</a><a name="ix.xxxix-p10.3"></A><b>,)</b> either to mark his affection, 			 or because he was aware that this sign was, at that time, advantageous: for we know, that he freely used outward signs, when the time required them.</p>

 			  by whom he executes his judgments. Now, as he is said to send such messengers by his command and pleasure, so he also restrains and recalls them whenever he pleases. The manner in which he healed them is not mentioned by Matthew and Mark: but Luke says, that it was by <i>laying hands on each of them.</i> Under the Law, this was a 			 sign of reconciliation; and, therefore, it was not improperly, or unseasonably, that Christ <i>laid hands </i>on those whom he freed from the curse of God. It was also a solemn rite of consecration, as will afterwards be more fully explained. But I interpret Christ&#8217;s <i>laying hands </i>on the sick, as meaning simply, that he recommended them to the Father, and thus obtained for them grace and deliverance from 			 their diseases.</p>

<p><a name="ix.xxxix-p15"></A><b><a name="ix.xxxix-p15.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017">Matthew 8:17</a><a name="ix.xxxix-p15.2"></A>.</b> <i>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet.</i> This prediction has the appearance of being inappropriate, and even of being tortured into a meaning which it does not bear: for Isaiah does not there speak of miracles, but 			 of the death of Christ, &#8212; and not of temporal benefits, but of spiritual and eternal grace. Now, what is undoubtedly spoken about the impurities of the soul, Matthew applies to bodily diseases. The solution is not difficult, if the reader will only observe, that the Evangelist states not merely the benefit conferred by Christ on those sick persons, but the purpose for which he healed their diseases. They experienced in their bodies the grace of Christ, but we must look at the design: for it 			 would be idle to confine our view to a transitory advantage, as if the Son of God were a physician of bodies. What then? He gave sight to the blind, in order to show that he is &#8220;the light of the world,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xxxix-p15.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012">Joh 8:12</a><a name="ix.xxxix-p15.3"></A>.) He restored life to the dead, to prove that he is &#8220;the resurrection and the life,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xxxix-p15.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025">Joh 11:25</a><a name="ix.xxxix-p15.4"></A>.) Similar observations might be made as to those who were lame, or had palsy. Following out this analogy, let us connect those benefits, which Christ bestowed on men in the flesh, with the design which is stated to us by Matthew, that he was sent by the Father, to relieve us from all evils and miseries.</p>

This latter reason is undoubtedly true: for he must have known, that the prince of death, and his agents, are in a state of irreconcileable enmity with the Author of eternal salvation and life.</p>

<p><a name="ix.xxxix-p19"></A><b><a name="ix.xxxix-p19.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#018">Matthew 8:18</a><a name="ix.xxxix-p19.2"></A></b> <i>And when Jesus had seen great multitudes about him.</i> Matthew, I have no doubt, touches briefly what the others explain in a more ample and copious narrative. The other two state a circumstance, which is not noticed by Matthew that Christ 			 withdrew privately, for the sake of retirement, <i>into a desert place, </i>before it was daylight. Mark afterwards says, that Peter informed him, <i>all seek, thee; </i>and Luke says, that <i>multitudes </i>came to that place. Again, Matthew says, that <i>he passed over to the other side, </i>while the other two say, that he 			 passed <i>through all Galilee, </i>to preach in every place. But <i>the other side, </i>or, <i>the farther bank, (</i><a name="ix.xxxix-p19.3"></A>&#964;&#8056; &#960;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#957;,) does not, I think, denote what was strictly the opposite side, but refers to that curvature of the lake, which was below Capernaum. In this way, he crossed over to 			 another part of the lake, and yet did not go out of Galilee.</p>

<p><a name="ix.xxxix-p21"></A><b>Mark1:38.</b> <i>For on this account I came out.</i> <b><a name="ix.xxxix-p21.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#043">Luke 4:43</a><a name="ix.xxxix-p21.2"></A>.</b> <i>For on this account am I sent.</i> These words deserve our 			 attention: for they contain a declaration of his earnest desire to fulfill his office. But it will perhaps be asked, is it better that the ministers of the Gospel should run here and there, to give only a slight and partial taste of it in each place, or that they should remain, and instruct perfectly the hearers whom they have once obtained? I reply. The design of Christ, which is here mentioned, was agreeable to the injunction and call of the Father, and was founded on the best reasons. For it 			 was necessary that Christ should travel, within a short period, throughout Judea, to awaken the minds of men, on all sides, as if by the sound of a trumpet, to hear the Gospel. But on this subject we must treat more fully under another passage.</p>
