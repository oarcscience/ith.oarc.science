 				   because there was no room for them in the inn.</p> 				  			   		    		  
<p><a name="ix.xvi-p11"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvi-p12"></A><a name="ix.xvi-p12.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvi-p13"></A>Luke relates how it happened, that Christ was born in the city of Bethlehem, as his mother was living at a distance from her home, when she was approaching to her confinement. And first he sets aside the idea of human contrivance,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">123</FONT></A>
 			  by saying, that Joseph and Mary had left home, and came to that place to make the return according to their family and tribe. If intentionally and on purpose  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="#fn_123"><FONT SIZE="1">124</FONT></A>
 			  they had changed their residence that Mary might bring forth her child in Bethlehem, we would have looked only at the human beings concerned. But as they have no other design than to obey the edict of Augustus, we readily acknowledge, that they were led like blind persons, by the hand of God, to the place where Christ must be born. This may appear to be accidental, as everything else, which does not proceed from a direct human intention, is ascribed by irreligious men to 			 Fortune. But we must not attend merely to the events themselves. We must remember also the prediction which was uttered by the prophet many centuries before. A comparison will clearly show it to have been accomplished by the wonderful Providence of God, that a registration was then enacted by Augustus Caesar, and that Joseph and Mary set out from home, so as to arrive in Bethlehem at the very point of time.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvi-p16"></A>Thus we see that the holy servants of God, even though they wander from their design, unconscious where they are going, still keep the right path, because God directs their steps. Nor is the Providence of God less wonderful in employing the mandate of a tyrant to draw Mary from home, that the prophecy may be fulfilled. God had marked out by his prophet &#8212; as we shall afterwards see &#8212; the place where he determined that his Son should be born. 			 If Mary had not been constrained to do otherwise, she would have chosen to bring forth her child at home. Augustus orders a registration to take place in Judea, and each person to give his name, that they may afterwards pay an annual tax, which they were formerly accustomed to pay to God. Thus an ungodly man takes forcible possession of that which God was accustomed to demand from his people. It was, in effect, reducing the Jews to entire subjection, and forbidding them to be thenceforth 			 reckoned as the people of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvi-p17"></A>Matters have been brought, in this way, to the last extremity, and the Jews appear to be cut off and alienated for ever from the covenant of God. At that very time does God suddenly, and contrary to universal expectation, afford a remedy. What is more, he employs that wicked tyranny for the redemption of his people. For the governor, (or whoever was employed by Caesar for the purpose,) while he executes the commission 			 entrusted to him, is, unknown to himself, God&#8217;s herald, to call Mary to the place which God had appointed. And certainly Luke&#8217;s whole narrative may well lead believers to acknowledge, that Christ was led by the hand of God <i>&#8220;</i>from his mother&#8217;s belly,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xvi-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010">Ps 22:10</a><a name="ix.xvi-p17.1"></A>.) Nor is it of small consequence   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">125</FONT></A>
 			  to the certainty of faith to know, that Mary was drawn suddenly, and contrary to her own intention, to Bethlehem, that &#8220;out of it might come forth&#8221; (<a name="ix.xvi-p18.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002">Mic 5:2</a><a name="ix.xvi-p18.3"></A>) the Redeemer, as he had been formerly promised.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvi-p19"></A><b>1. </b><i>The whole world</i> This figure of speech   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">126</FONT></A>
 			  (by which the whole is taken for a part, or a part for the whole) was in constant use among the Roman authors, and ought not to be reckoned harsh. That this registration might be more tolerable and less odious, it was extended equally, I have no doubt, to all the provinces; though the rate of taxation may have been different. I consider <i>this first registration</i> to mean, that the Jews, being completely subdued, were then loaded with a new and unwonted yoke. Others read it, that this registration <i>was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria;</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">127</FONT></A>
 			  but there is no probability in that view. The tax was, indeed, annual; but the registration did not take place every year. The meaning is, that the Jews were far more heavily oppressed than they had formerly been.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvi-p22"></A>There is a diversity as to the name of the Proconsul. Some call him <i>Cyrenius, </i>(<a name="ix.xvi-p22.1"></A>&#922;&#965;&#961;&#8053;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#962;,) and others, <i>Quirinus</i> or <i>Quirinius</i> But there is nothing strange in this;for we know that the Greeks, when they translate Latin names, almost always make some change in the pronunciation. But a far greater difficulty springs up in another direction. Josephus says that, while Archelaus was a prisoner at Vienna, (Ant. 17:13. 2,) Quirinus came as Proconsul, with instructions to annex Judea to 			 the province of Syria, (xviii. 1.1.) Now, historians are agreed, that Archelaus reigned nine years after the death of his father Herod. It would therefore appear, that there was an interval of about thirteen years between the birth of Christ and this registration; for almost all assent to the account given by Epiphanius, that Christ was born in the thirty-third year of Herod: that is, four years before his death.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvi-p23"></A>Another circumstance not a little perplexing is, that the same Josephus speaks of this registration as having happened in the thirty-seventh year after the victory at Actium,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">128</FONT></A>
 			  (Ant. 18:2. 1.) If this be true, Augustus lived, at the utmost, not more than seven years after this event; which makes a deduction of eight or nine years from his age: for it is plain from the third chapter of Luke&#8217;s Gospel, that he was at that time only in his fifteenth year. But, as the age of Christ is too well known to be called in question, it is highly probable that, in this and many other passages of Josephus&#8217;s History, his recollection had failed him. Historians are 			 agreed that Quirinus was Consul nineteen years, or thereby, before the victory over Antony, which gave Augustus the entire command of the empire: and so he must have been sent into the province at a very advanced age. Besides, the same Josephus enumerates four governors of Judea within eight years; while he acknowledges that the fifth was governor for fifteen years. That was Valerius Gratus, who was succeeded by Pontius Pilate.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvi-p25"></A>Another solution may be offered. It might be found impracticable to effect the registration immediately after the edict had been issued: for Josephus relates, that Coponius was sent with an army to reduce the Jews to subjection, (Ant. 18:2.2) from which it may easily be inferred, that the registration was prevented, for a time, by popular tumult. The words of Luke bear this sense, that, about the time of our Lord&#8217;s birth, an 			 edict came out to have the people registered, but that the registration could not take place till after a change of the kingdom, when Judea had been annexed to another province. This clause is accordingly added by way of correction. <i>This first registration was made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria</i> That is, it was then first carried into effect.  			  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">129</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvi-p27"></A>But the whole question is not yet answered: for, while Herod was king of Judea, what purpose did it serve to register a people who paid no tribute to the Roman Empire? I reply: there is no absurdity in supposing that Augustus, by way of accustoming the Jews to the yoke, (for their obstinacy was abundantly well-known,) chose to have them registered, even under the reign of Herod.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">130</FONT></A>
 			  Nor did Herod&#8217;s peculiar authority as king make it inconsistent that the Jews should pay to the Roman Empire a stipulated sum for each man under the name of a tax: for we know that Herod, though he was called a king, held nothing more than a borrowed power, and was little better than a slave. On what authority Eusebius states that this registration took place by an order of the Roman Senate, I know not.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvi-p29"></A><a name="ix.xvi-p29.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xvi-p30"></A><b>7. </b><i>Because there was no room for them in the inn</i> We see here not only the great poverty of Joseph, but the cruel tyranny which admitted of no excuse, but compelled Joseph to bring his wife along with him, at an inconvenient season, when she was near the time of her delivery. Indeed, it is probable that those 			 who were the descendants of the royal family were treated more harshly and disdainfully than the rest. Joseph was not so devoid of feeling as to have no concern about his wife&#8217;s delivery. He would gladly have avoided this necessity: but, as that is impossible, he is forced to yield,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">131</FONT></A>
 			  and commends himself to God. We see, at the same time, what sort of beginning the life of the Son of God had, and in what cradle   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">132</FONT></A>
 			  he was placed. Such was his condition at his birth, because he had taken upon him our flesh for this purpose, that he might, &#8220;empty himself&#8221; (<a name="ix.xvi-p32.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007">Php 2:7</a><a name="ix.xvi-p32.2"></A>) on our account. When he was thrown into a stable, and placed in a manger, and a lodging refused him among men, it was that heaven might be opened to us, not as a temporary 			 lodging,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">133</FONT></A>
 			  but as our eternal country and inheritance, and that angels might receive us into their abode.</p>
