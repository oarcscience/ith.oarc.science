<p><a name="ix.xliv-p11"></A><b><a name="ix.xliv-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#020">Matthew 5:20</a><a name="ix.xliv-p11.1"></A>.</b> <i>Unless your righteousness shall be more abundant. He</i> takes a passing notice of <i>the Scribes, </i>who were laboring to throw a stain on the doctrine of the Gospel, as if it were the ruin of the Law. True, he does not reason on 			 this subject, but only points out briefly, that nothing has less influence over their minds than zeal for the law. &#8220;They pretend, that their hostility to me arises from their strong desire, that the law should not be violated. But their life makes it evident, how coldly they observe the law, &#8212; nay more, how unconcerned they are about mocking God,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_391"></A><A HREF="#fn_391"><FONT SIZE="1">392</FONT></A>
 			  while they boast before men of an assumed and hypocritical righteousness.&#8221; This is the view which the most of commentators give of the passage.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xliv-p13"></A>But it deserves inquiry, whether he does not rather blame the corrupted manner of teaching, which <i>the Pharisees and Scribes </i>followed in instructing the people. By confining the law of God to outward duties only, they trained their disciples, like apes, to hypocrisy.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_392"></A><A HREF="#fn_392"><FONT SIZE="1">393</FONT></A>
 			 They lived, I readily admit, as ill as they taught, and even worse: and therefore, along with their corrupted doctrine, I willingly include their hypocritical parade of false righteousness. The principal charge brought by Christ against their doctrine may be easily learned from what follows in the discourse, where he removes from the law their false and wicked interpretations, and restores it to its purity. In short, the objection which, as we have already said, was unjustly brought 			 against him by the Scribes, is powerfully thrown back on themselves.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xliv-p15"></A>We must bear in mind, what we have mentioned elsewhere, that the Pharisees are added to the Scribes by way of enlarging on what he had said: for that sect had, above all others, obtained a reputation for sanctity. It is a mistake, however, to suppose, that they were called <i>Pharisees </i>on account of <i>division,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_393"></A><A HREF="#fn_393"><FONT SIZE="1">394</FONT></A>
 			  because they <i>separated </i>themselves from the ordinary class, and claimed a rank peculiar to themselves. They were called <a name="ix.xliv-p16.2"></A>&#1508;&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1497;&#1501;, that is, <i>Expounders,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_394"></A><A HREF="#fn_394"><FONT SIZE="1">395</FONT></A>
 			  because they were not satisfied with the bare letter, but boasted of being in possession of a key to open up hidden meanings. Hence arose an immense mass of errors, when they assumed magisterial authority, and ventured, according to their wicked fancy and their equally wicked pride, to thrust forward their own inventions in place of Scripture.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xliv-p18"></A><a name="ix.xliv-p18.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xliv-p19"></A><b>21. </b><i>You have heard that it was said.</i> This sentence, and those which immediately follow, are connected with what we have just considered: for our Lord explains more fully, by minute instances, by what tortuous methods   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_395"></A><A HREF="#fn_395"><FONT SIZE="1">396</FONT></A>
 			  the Pharisees debase the law, so that their righteousness is mere filth. It is a mistake, however, to suppose that this is an <a name="ix.xliv-p20.2"></A>&#7952;&#960;&#945;&#957;&#8057;&#961;&#952;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;<i>, </i>or <i>correction </i>  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_396"></A><A HREF="#fn_396"><FONT SIZE="1">397</FONT></A>
 			  of the Law, and that Christ raises his disciples to a higher degree of perfection, than Christ could raise a gross and carnal nation, which was scarcely able to learn first principles. It has been a prevailing opinion, that the beginning of righteousness was laid down in the ancient law, but that the perfection of it is pointed out in the Gospel. But nothing was farther from the design of Christ, than to alter or innovate any thing in the 			 commandments of the law. There God has once fixed the rule of life which he will never retract. But as the law had been corrupted by false expositions, and turned to a profane meaning, Christ vindicates it against such corruptions, and points out its true meaning, from which the Jews had departed.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xliv-p22"></A>That the doctrine of the law not only commences, but brings to perfection, a holy life, may be inferred from a single fact, that it requires a perfect love of God and of our neighbor, (<a name="ix.xliv-p22.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005">De 6:5</a><a name="ix.xliv-p22.1"></A>; <a name="ix.xliv-p22.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018">Le 19:18</a><a name="ix.xliv-p22.2"></A>.) He who possesses such a love wants nothing of the 			 highest perfection. So far as respects the rules of a holy life, the law conducts men to the goal, or farthest point, of righteousness. Accordingly, Paul declares <i>the law</i> to be <i>weak, </i>not in itself, but in our <i>flesh, </i>(<a name="ix.xliv-p22.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003">Ro 8:3</a><a name="ix.xliv-p22.3"></A>.) But if Moses had given nothing more than the first lessons of true righteousness, how ridiculous would have been that appeal!</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xliv-p23"></A>&#8220;I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that ye may live,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xliv-p23.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#019">De 30:19</a><a name="ix.xliv-p23.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xliv-p24"></A>Again,</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xliv-p25"></A>&#8220;And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul?&#8221; (<a name="ix.xliv-p25.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012">De 10:12</a><a name="ix.xliv-p25.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xliv-p26"></A>Vain and deceitful, also, would have been that promise, &#8220;The man that doeth them shall live in them,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xliv-p26.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005">Le 18:5</a><a name="ix.xliv-p26.1"></A>; <a name="ix.xliv-p26.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005">Ro 10:5</a><a name="ix.xliv-p26.2"></A>; <a name="ix.xliv-p26.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012">Ga 3:12</a><a name="ix.xliv-p26.3"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xliv-p27"></A>That Christ, on the other hand, intended to make no correction in the precepts of the law, is very clear from other passages: for to those who desire to enter into life by their good works, he gives no other injunction, than to, <i>keep the commandments</i> of the law, (<a name="ix.xliv-p27.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017">Mt 19:17</a><a name="ix.xliv-p27.1"></A>.) From no other source do the Apostles, as well as Christ himself, draw the rules for a devout and holy life. It is doing a grievous injury to God, the author of the Law, to imagine that the eyes, and hands, and feet alone, are trained by it to a hypocritical appearance of good works, and that it is only in the Gospel that we are taught to love God with the heart. Away, then, with that error, &#8220;The 			 deficiencies of the law are here supplied by Christ.&#8221; We must not imagine Christ to be a new legislator, who adds any thing to the eternal righteousness of his Father. We must listen to him as a faithful expounder, that we may know what is the nature of the law, what is its object, and what is its extent.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xliv-p28"></A>It now remains for us to see, what Christ condemns in the Pharisees, and in what respect his interpretation of it differs from their glosses. The amount of it is, that they had changed the doctrine of the law into a political order, and had made obedience to it to consist entirely in the performance of outward duties. Hence it came, that he who had not slain a man with his hand was pronounced to be free from the guilt of 			 murder, and he who had not polluted his body by adultery was supposed to be pure and chaste before God. This was an intolerable profanation of the law: for it is certain, that Moses everywhere demands the spiritual worship of God. From the very nature of the law we must conclude, that God, who gave it by the hand of Moses, spoke to the hearts, as well as to the hands and to the eyes. True, our Lord quotes the very words of the law; but he does so in accommodation to the view which was generally 			 taken of them by the people. &#8220;Till now, <i>the scribes</i> have given you a literal interpretation of the law, that it is enough, if a man keep his hands from murder and from acts of violence. But I warn you, that you must ascend much higher. <i>Love is the fulfilling of the law,</i> (<a name="ix.xliv-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010">Ro 13:10</a><a name="ix.xliv-p28.1"></A>;)and I say that your neighbor is injured, when you act towards him otherwise than as a friend.&#8221; The latter clause which he quotes, <i>he who kills shall be liable to the judgment, </i>confirms what I said a little before, that Christ charges them with turning into a political scheme the law of God, 			 which had been given for the government of the heart.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xliv-p29"></A><a name="ix.xliv-p29.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xliv-p30"></A><b>22. </b><i>But I say to you</i> His reply is not opposed to the command of Moses, (<a name="ix.xliv-p30.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#013">Ex 20:13</a><a name="ix.xliv-p30.1"></A>; <a name="ix.xliv-p30.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#021">Le 24:21</a><a name="ix.xliv-p30.2"></A>; <a name="ix.xliv-p30.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#016">Nu 35:16</a><a name="ix.xliv-p30.3"></A>;) but to the interpretation usually put upon it by the scribes. Now, as the Pharisees boasted of antiquity, (for it is always the custom to plead the prescription of a long period in defense of errors,)   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_397"></A><A HREF="#fn_397"><FONT SIZE="1">398</FONT></A>
 			  Christ reminds the people of his authority, to which all antiquity ought justly to give way. Hence we conclude, that truth is of greater weight than custom or the number of years.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xliv-p32"></A><i>He who shall say to his brother</i> Christ assigns three degrees of condemnation besides the violence of the hands; which implies, that this precept of the law restrains not only the hands, but all affections that are opposed to brotherly love. &#8220;Those who shall only be angry with their brethren, or treat them with haughty disdain, or 			 injure them by any reproach, are murderers.&#8221; Now, as it is certain that the word <i>Racha</i> occupies an intermediate place between <i>anger </i>and openly reproachful language, I have no doubt that it is an interjection of contempt or disdain. Though Christ adjudges <i>to the hell of 			 fire</i> none but those who break out into open reproach, we must not suppose, that he declares <i>anger </i>to be free from a similar punishment; but, alluding to earthly judgments, he assures them that God will judge and punish even concealed <i>anger.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_398"></A><A HREF="#fn_398"><FONT SIZE="1">399</FONT></A>
 			  But, as he who manifests his indignation by bitter language goes farther than this, Christ says, that that man will be held guilty by the<i> whole heavenly council, </i>that he may receive severer punishment.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xliv-p34"></A>Those, again, who break out into reproaches are adjudged <i>to the hell of fire: </i>which implies, that hatred, and every thing that is contrary to love, is enough to expose them to eternal death, though they may have committed no acts of violence. <a name="ix.xliv-p34.1"></A>&#915;&#7956;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#945; (<i>hell</i>) is, beyond all question, a foreign word. <a name="ix.xliv-p34.2"></A>&#1490;&#1497;&#1488; (<i>Ge</i>) is the Hebrew word for a valley. Now, &#8220;the valley of Hin-nom&#8221; was infamous for the detestable superstition which was committed in 			 it, because there they sacrificed their children to idols, (<a name="ix.xliv-p34.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#006">2Ch 33:6</a><a name="ix.xliv-p34.3"></A>.) The consequence was, that holy men, in order to excite stronger hatred of that wicked ungodliness, used it as the name for <i>hell, </i>that the very name might be dreaded by the people as shocking and alarming. It would appear that, in the time of Christ, 			 this was a received way of speaking, and that <i>hell</i> was then called by no other name than <i>gehenna, (</i><a name="ix.xliv-p34.4"></A>&#947;&#8051;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#945;<i>,) </i>the word being slightly altered from the true pronunciation.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.xliv-p17"></A> Among a host of opinions as to the origin of the name <i>Pharisees, </i>there is room to doubt if Calvin has hit upon the true etymology. There are two roots: <a name="ix.xliv-p17.2"></A>&#1508;&#1512;&#1474;&#1513; <i>(paras,) to spread out, </i>with <i>Sin </i>for the final letter, &#8212; and <a name="ix.xliv-p17.3"></A>&#1508;&#1512;&#1473;&#1513; <i>(parash,). to explain, to separate, </i>with <i>Schin. </i>Both have been pressed into the service. The former is chiefly quoted in support of an allusion to our Lord's description of them, that 				  <i>they make broad their phylacteries, </i>(<a name="ix.xliv-p17.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005">Mt 23:5</a><a name="ix.xliv-p17.4"></A>.)
