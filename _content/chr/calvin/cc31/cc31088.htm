 			  for in this way God gathered to himself a people sadly scattered, that he might <i>reign </i>in the midst of them; and, indeed, he erected his throne for the express purpose of bestowing on all his people perfect happiness. Yet let us remember that we must be subject to God, in order that we may be exalted by him to the heavenly glory.</p>

<p><a name="ix.lxxx-p9"></A><b>36. </b><i>He was moved with compassion towards them</i>  Hence we infer, first, how great was the indolence of the priests, who, though they were scattered over the whole country, in order to enlighten the people with heavenly doctrine, were <i>slow-bellies, </i>(<a name="ix.lxxx-p9.1"></A>Titus 1:12.) True, they boasted that they were superintendents of the people; and the number of those who gloried in that title was not small. Yet not one of them does Christ own to be a pastor. A similar confusion may now be observed in Popery, though it is full of persons who are called pastors: for there is a 			 prodigious crowd of those who under the name of clergy, eat up the flock. They are <i>dumb dogs,</i> (<a name="ix.lxxx-p9.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#010">Isa 56:10</a><a name="ix.lxxx-p9.2"></A>,) and yet are not ashamed to make a vehement sound about their hierarchy. But we must listen to the voice of Christ, who declares, that where there are no <i>laborers </i>there are no shepherds, and that those sheep are wandering and scattered which are not collected into the fold of God by the doctrine of the gospel. His being <i>moved with compassion </i>proves him to be the faithful servant of the Father in promoting the salvation of his people, for whose sake he had clothed himself with our flesh. Now that he has been received into heaven, he does not retain the same feelings to which he chose to be 			 liable in this mortal life: yet he has not left off the care of his church, but looks after his wandering sheep, or rather, he gathers his flock which had been cruelly chased and torn by the wolves.</p>

<p><a name="ix.lxxx-p11"></A><b>37. </b><i>The harvest is indeed abundant</i>  By this metaphor he intimates, that many of the people are ripe for receiving the gospel. Though the greater number afterwards rejected basely and with vile ingratitude the salvation offered to them, yet the limited number of 			 the elect, who were mixed with unbelievers, is compared to an <i>abundant harvest, </i>because God values a small band of his own people more highly than the rest of the world. Though there were at that time many who assumed this character, yet as few of them discharged it faithfully, he does not rank them among <i>laborers: </i>for he employs the word <i>laborers </i>in a good sense. When Paul complains (<a name="ix.lxxx-p11.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#013">2Co 2:13</a><a name="ix.lxxx-p11.2"></A>) of bad <i>laborers, </i>he refers to their boasting: for he would not have bestowed the designation of <i>laborers</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_533"></A><A HREF="#fn_533"><FONT SIZE="1">534</FONT></A>
 			  on those who devoted all their exertions to ruin and waste the flock, had it not been that they gloried in the false pretense.</p>

<p><a name="ix.lxxx-p14"></A><b>38. </b><i>Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest</i>  As no man will of himself become a sincere and faithful minister of the gospel, and as none discharge in a proper manner the office of teacher but those whom the Lord raises up and endows with the gifts of his Spirit, whenever we observe 			 a scarcity of pastors, we must raise our eyes to him to afford the remedy. There never was greater necessity for offering this prayer than during the fearful desolation of the church which we now see every where around us.</p>
