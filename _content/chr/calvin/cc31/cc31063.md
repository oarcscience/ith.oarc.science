<span id="ix.lv-p4"></span>**14**.** **For if you shall forgive men
their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
**15**.** **But if you shall not forgive men their trespasses, neither
will you Father forgive your trespasses.

<span id="ix.lv-p5"></span>**25**.** **And when ye shall stand praying,
forgive, if you have any thing against any one, that your Father also,
who is in heaven, may forgive you your trespasses. **26**.** **But if
you shall not forgive, neither will your Father, who is in heaven,
forgive you your trespasses.

<span id="ix.lv-p7"></span><span id="ix.lv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lv-p8"></span>Here Christ only explains the reason why that
condition was added, *Forgive us, as we forgive* The reason is, that God
will not be ready to hear us, unless we also show ourselves ready to
grant forgiveness to those who have offended us. If we are not harder
than iron, this exhortation ought to soften us, and render us disposed
to forgive offenses.  <span id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444) Unless God
pardon us every day many sins, we know that we are ruined in innumerable
ways: and on no other condition does he admit us to pardon, but that we
pardon our brethren whatever offenses they have committed against us.
Those who refuse to forget the injuries which have been done to them,
devote themselves willingly and deliberately to destruction, and
knowingly prevent God from forgiving them.  <span
