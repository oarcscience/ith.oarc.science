<span id="ix.lxviii-p2"></span><span id="ix.lxviii-p2.1"></span>[Matthew
7:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#021)<span

<span id="ix.lxviii-p3"></span><span id="ix.lxviii-p3.1"></span>[Luke
6:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#046)<span id="ix.lxviii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxviii-p4"></span>**21**.** **Not every one that saith to
me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, bu the who shall
do the will of my Father who is in heaven. **22**.** **Many will say to
me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in
thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name have done many wonderful
works? **23**.** **And then will I confess to them, I never knew you
depart from me, you who work iniquity.

<span id="ix.lxviii-p5"></span>**46**. And why call you me Lord, Lord,
and do not the things which I say?

<span id="ix.lxviii-p6"></span> 

<span id="ix.lxviii-p7"></span><span id="ix.lxviii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxviii-p8"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxviii-p8.2"></span>[Matthew
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#021)<span
id="ix.lxviii-p8.2"></span>.** *Not every one that saith to me, Lord,
Lord.* Christ extends his discourse farther: for he speaks not only of
*false prophets,* who rush upon the flock to tear and devour, but of
hirelings, who insinuate themselves, under fair appearances, as pastors,
though they have no feeling of piety.  <span
id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477) This doctrine embraces all hypocrites,
whatever may be their rank or station, but at present he refers
particularly to pretended teachers,  <span
id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478) who seem to excel others. He not only
directs his discourse to them, to rouse them from the indifference, in
which they lie asleep like drunk people, but also warns believers, not
to estimate such masks beyond their proper value. In a word, he declares
that, so soon as the doctrine of the Gospel shall have begun to bear
fruit by obtaining many disciples, there will not only be very many of
the common people who falsely and hypocritically submit to it, but even
in the rank of pastors there will be the same treachery, so that they
will deny by their actions and life what they profess with the mouth.
 <span id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479) Whoever then desires to be
reckoned among the disciples, must labor to devote himself, sincerely
and honestly, to the exercises of a new life.

<span id="ix.lxviii-p12"></span>In the Gospel of Luke, it is a general
reproof: *Why call you me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I
say?* But as this corruption proceeds, for the most part, from pretended
teachers, and easily finds its way from them into the whole body, so,
according to Matthew, our Lord expressly attacks them. *To do the will
of the Father* not only means, to regulate their life and manners, (as
philosophers talked  <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480) ) by the
rule of virtues, but also to believe in Christ, according to that
saying,

<span id="ix.lxviii-p14"></span>“This is the will of him that sent me,
that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have
everlasting life,”  
(<span id="ix.lxviii-p14.2"></span>[Joh
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040)<span
id="ix.lxviii-p14.2"></span>.)

<span id="ix.lxviii-p15"></span>These words, therefore, do not exclude
faith, but presuppose it as the principle from which other good works
flow.

<span id="ix.lxviii-p16"></span><span id="ix.lxviii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxviii-p17"></span>**22.** *Many will say to me* Christ
again summons hypocrites to his judgment-seat, as we showed a little ago
from Luke. So long as they hold a place in his Church, they both flatter
themselves and deceive others. He therefore declares, that a day is
coming, when he will cleanse his barn, and separate the chaff and straw
from the pure wheat. *To prophesy in the name of Christ* is, to
discharge the office of teacher by his authority, and, as it were, under
his direction. *Prophecy* is here, I think, taken in a large sense, as
in the fourteenth chapter of the Epistle to the Corinthians. He might
have simply used the word *preach,* but purposely employed the more
honorable appellation, in order to show more clearly, that an outward
profession is nothing, whatever may be its brilliancy in the eyes of
men. *To do wonderful works in the name of Christ* is nothing else than
to perform miracles by his power, authority, command, and direction:
for, though the word <span id="ix.lxviii-p17.1"></span>ὁμολογήσω,
*powers,* is sometimes confined to one class of miracles, yet in this
and many other passages it denotes every kind of miracles.

<span id="ix.lxviii-p18"></span><span id="ix.lxviii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxviii-p19"></span>**23.** *And then will I confess to
them*  <span id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481) By using the word <span
id="ix.lxviii-p20.2"></span>ὁμολογήσω*, I will confess,*  <span
id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482) Christ appears to allude to the vain
boasting, by which hypocrites now vaunt themselves. *“*They indeed have
*confessed* me with the tongue, and imagine that they have fully
discharged their duty. The *confession* of my name is now heard aloud
from their tongue. But I too will *confess* on the opposite side, that
their profession is deceitful and false.” And what is contained in
Christ’s *confession?* That he never reckoned them among his own people,
even at the time when they boasted that they were the pillars of the
church.

<span id="ix.lxviii-p22"></span>*Depart from me.* He orders those
persons to go out from his presence, who had stolen, under a false
title, an unjust and temporary possession of his house. From this
passage in our Lord’s discourse Paul seems to have taken what he says to
Timothy,

<span id="ix.lxviii-p23"></span>The Lord knoweth who are his: and, let
every one who calleth on the name of Christ depart from iniquity, (<span
id="ix.lxviii-p23.1"></span>[2Ti
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019)<span
id="ix.lxviii-p23.1"></span>.)

<span id="ix.lxviii-p24"></span>The former clause is intended to prevent
weak minds from being alarmed or discouraged by the desertion of those
who had a great and distinguished reputation:  <span
id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483) for he declares that they were
disowned by the Lord, though by a vain show they captivated the eyes of
men. He then exhorts all those who wish to be reckoned among the
disciples of Christ, to *withdraw* early from *iniquity,* that Christ
may not drive them from his presence, when he shall *“separate the sheep
from the goats*,” (<span id="ix.lxviii-p25.2"></span>[Mt
25:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#033)<span
id="ix.lxviii-p25.2"></span>.)
