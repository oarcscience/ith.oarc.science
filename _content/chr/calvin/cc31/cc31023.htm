<p><a name="ix.xv-p3"></A><b>18</b>.<b>&nbsp;</b>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this manner. For when his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit. <b>19</b>.<b>&nbsp;</b>And Joseph her husband, as he was a just man, and was unwilling to injure her reputation, intended to send her away secretly. <b>20</b>.<b>&nbsp;</b>And while he was considering these things, lo, the angel of the Lord appeared 				  to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit. <b>21</b>.<b>&nbsp;</b>And she shall bear a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS. For he shall save his people from their sins. <b>22</b>.<b>&nbsp;</b>Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, <b>23</b>.<b>&nbsp;</b>Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son, and 				  they shall call his name Immanuel: which, if one interprets it, means, God is with us. <b>24</b>.<b>&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and took unto him his wife: <b>25</b>.<b>&nbsp;</b>And knew her not, till she brought forth her first-born son: and called his name JESUS.</p>

<p><a name="ix.xv-p6"></A><b>18.</b><i> Now the birth of Jesus Christ</i> Matthew does not as yet relate the place or manner of Christ&#8217;s birth, but the way in which his heavenly generation was made known to Joseph. First, he says that Mary <i>was found to be with child by the Holy 			 Spirit</i> Not that this secret work of God was generally known: but the historian mixes up, with the knowledge of men,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">97</FONT></A>
 			  the power of the Spirit, which was still unknown. He points out the time: <i>When she was espoused to Joseph, </i>and <i>before they came together</i> So far as respects conjugal fidelity, from the time that a young woman was betrothed to a man, she was 			 regarded by the Jews as his lawful wife. When a &#8220;damsel betrothed to an husband&#8221; was convicted of being unchaste, the law condemned both of the guilty parties as adulterers:</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xv-p8"></A>&#8220;the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; <br> 			 and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbor&#8217;s wife,&#8221; <br> 			 (<a name="ix.xv-p8.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023">Deut. 22:23</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#024">24</a><a name="ix.xv-p8.3"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p9"></A>The phrase employed by the Evangelist, <i>before they came together, </i>is either a modest appellation for conjugal intercourse, or simply means, &#8220;before they came to dwell together as husband and wife, and to make one home and family.&#8221; The meaning will thus be, that the virgin had not yet been delivered by her parents 			 into the hands of her husband, but still remained under their roof.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p10"></A><a name="ix.xv-p10.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p11"></A><b>19.</b> <i>As he was a just man</i> Some commentators explain this to mean, that Joseph, <i>because</i> he was a just man, determined to spare his wife:   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">98</FONT></A>
 			  taking <i>justice </i>to be only another name for humanity, or, a gentle and merciful disposition. But others more correctly read the two clauses as contrasted with each other: that Joseph <i>was a just man, </i>but yet that he was anxious about the reputation of his wife. That justice, on which a commendation is here bestowed, consisted in hatred and abhorrence of crime. 			 Suspecting his wife of adultery, and even convinced that she was an adulterer, he was unwilling to hold out the encouragement of lenity to such a crime.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">99</FONT></A>
 			  And certainly he is but a pander   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_99"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">100</FONT></A>
 			  to his wife, who connives at her unchastity. Not only is such wickedness regarded with abhorrence by good and honorable minds, but that winking at crime which I have mentioned is marked by the laws with infamy.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p15"></A>Joseph, therefore, moved by an ardent love <i>of justice, </i>condemned the crime of which he supposed his wife to have been guilty; while the gentleness of his disposition prevented him from going to the utmost rigor of law. It was a moderate and calmer method to depart privately, and remove to a distant 			 place.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">101</FONT></A>
 			  Hence we infer, that he was not of so soft and effeminate a disposition, as to screen and promote uncleanness under the pretense of merciful dealing: he only made some abatement from stern justice, so as not to expose his wife to evil report. Nor ought we to have any hesitation in believing, that his mind was restrained by a secret inspiration of the Spirit. We know how weak jealousy is, and to what violence it hurries its possessor. Though Joseph did not proceed to 			 rash and headlong conduct, yet he was wonderfully preserved from many imminent dangers, which would have sprung out of his resolution to depart.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p17"></A>The same remark is applicable to Mary&#8217;s silence. Granting that modest reserve prevented her from venturing to tell her husband, that <i>she was with child by the Holy Spirit, </i>it was not so much by her own choice, as by the providence of God that she was restrained. Let us suppose her to have spoken. The nature of 			 the case made it little short of incredible. Joseph would have thought himself ridiculed, and everybody would have treated the matter as a laughing-stock: after which the Divine announcement, if it had followed, would have been of less importance. The Lord permitted his servant Joseph to be betrayed by ignorance into an erroneous conclusion, that, by his own voice, he might bring him back to the right path.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p18"></A>Yet it is proper for us to know, that this was done more on our account than for his personal advantage: for every necessary method was adopted by God, to prevent unfavorable suspicion from falling on the heavenly message. When the angel approaches Joseph, who is still unacquainted with the whole matter, wicked men have no reason to charge him with being influenced by prejudice to listen to the voice of God. He was not overcome by the 			 insinuating address of his wife. His previously formed opinion was not shaken by entreaties. He was not induced by human arguments to take the opposite side. But, while the groundless accusation of his wife was still rankling in his mind, God interposed between them, that we might regard Joseph as a more competent witness, and possessing greater authority, as a messenger sent to us from heaven. We see how God chose to employ an angel in informing his servant Joseph, that to others he might be a 			 heavenly herald, and that the intelligence which he conveyed might not be borrowed from his wife, or from any mortal.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p19"></A>The reason why this mystery was not immediately made known to a greater number of persons appears to be this. It was proper that this inestimable treasure should remain concealed, and that the knowledge of it should be imparted to none but the children of God. Nor is it absurd to say, that the Lord intended, as he frequently does, to put the faith and obedience of his own people to the trial. Most certainly, if any man shall maliciously refuse 			 to believe and obey God in this matter, he will have abundant reason to be satisfied with the proofs by which this article of our faith is supported. For the same reason, the Lord permitted Mary to enter into the married state, that under the veil of marriage, till the full time for revealing it, the heavenly conception of the virgin might be concealed. Meanwhile, the knowledge of it was withheld from unbelievers, as their ingratitude and malice deserved.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p20"></A><a name="ix.xv-p20.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p21"></A><b>20.</b> <i>And while he was considering these things</i> We see here how seasonably, and, as we would say, at the very point, the Lord usually aids his people. Hence too we infer that, when he appears not to observe our cares and distresses, we are still under his eye. He may, indeed, hide himself, 			 and remain silent; but, when our patience has been subjected to the trial, he will aid us at the time which his own wisdom has selected. How slow or late soever his assistance may be thought to be, it is for our advantage that it is thus delayed.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p22"></A><i>The angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream</i> This is one of two ordinary kinds of revelations mentioned in the book of Numbers, where the Lord thus speaks:</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xv-p23"></A>&#8220;If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream. My servant Moses is not so. With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speechess,&#8221; <br> 			 (<a name="ix.xv-p23.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006">Nu 12:6-8</a><a name="ix.xv-p23.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p24"></A>But we must understand that dreams of this sort differ widely from natural dreams; for they have a character of certainty engraven on them, and are impressed with a divine seal, so that there is not the slightest doubt of their truth. The dreams which men commonly have, arise either from the thoughts of the <i>day, </i>or from their natural temperament, or from bodily indisposition, or from similar causes: while the dreams which come from God are accompanied by the testimony of the Spirit, which puts beyond a doubt that it is God who speaks.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p25"></A><i>Son of David, fear not</i> This exhortation shows, that Joseph was perplexed with the fear of sharing in the criminality of his wife, by enduring her adultery. The angel removes his suspicion of guilt, with the view of enabling him to dwell with his wife with a safe conscience. The appellation, <i>Son of David, </i>was employed on the present occasion, in order to elevate his mind to that lofty mystery; for he belonged to that family, and was one of the surviving few,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_101"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">102</FONT></A>
 			  from whom the salvation promised to the world could proceed. When he heard the name of <i>David, </i>from whom he was <i>descended, </i>Joseph ought to have remembered that remarkable promise of God which related to the 			 establishment of the kingdom, so as to acknowledge that there was nothing new in what was now told him. The predictions of the prophets were, in effect, brought forward by the angel, to prepare the mind of Joseph for receiving the present favor.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p27"></A><a name="ix.xv-p27.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p28"></A><b>21. </b><i>And thou shalt call his name</i> <i>JESUS</i>. I have already explained briefly, but as far as was necessary, the meaning of that word. At present I shall only add, that the words of the angel set aside the dream of those who derive it from the essential 			 name of God, Jehovah; for the angel expresses the reason why the Son of God is so called, <i>Because he shall</i> <i>SAVE</i> <i>his people; </i>which suggests quite a different etymology from what they have contrived. It is 			 justly and appropriately added, they tell us, that Christ will be the author of salvation, because he is the Eternal God. But in vain do they attempt to escape by this subterfuge; for the nature of the blessing which God bestows upon us is not all that is here stated. This office was conferred upon his Son from the fact, from the command which had been given to him by the Father, from the office with which he was invested when he came down to us from heaven. Besides, the two words 			 <a name="ix.xv-p28.1"></A>&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962; and <a name="ix.xv-p28.2"></A>&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;<i>, Jesus </i>and <i>Jehovah, </i>agree but in two letters, and differ in all the rest; which makes it exceedingly absurd to allege any affinity whatever between them, as if they were but one name. Such mixtures I leave 			 to the alchymists, or to those who closely resemble them, the Cabalists who contrive for us those trifling and affected refinements.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p29"></A>When the Son of God came to us clothed in flesh, he received from the Father a name which plainly told for what purpose he came, what was his power, and what we had a right to expect from him. for the name <i>Jesus</i> is derived from the Hebrew verb, in the Hiphil conjugation, <a name="ix.xv-p29.1"></A>&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1497;&#1506;, which signifies <i>to save</i> In Hebrew it is pronounced differently, <i>Jehoshua; </i>but the Evangelists, who wrote in Greek, followed the customary mode of pronunciation; for in the writings of Moses, 			 and in the other books of the Old Testament, the Hebrew word <a name="ix.xv-p29.2"></A>&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1493;&#1506;, <i>Jehoshua, </i>or <i>Joshua, </i>is rendered by the Greek translators <a name="ix.xv-p29.3"></A>&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;, <i>Jesus</i> But I must mention another instance of the ignorance of those who derive &#8212; or, I would rather say, who forcibly tear &#8212; the name <i>Jesus</i> from <i>Jehovah</i> They hold it to be in the highest degree improper that any mortal man should share this name in common with the Son of God, and make a strange outcry that Christ would never allow his name to be so profaned. As if the reply were not at hand, that the name <i>Jesus</i> was quite as commonly used in those 			 days as the name <i>Joshua</i> Now, as it is sufficiently clear that the name <i>Jesus</i> presents to us the Son of God as the Author of salvation, let us examine more closely the words of the angel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p30"></A><i>He shall save his people from their sins</i> The first truth taught us by these words is, that those whom Christ is sent to save are in themselves lost. But he is expressly called the Savior of the Church. If those whom God admits to fellowship with himself were sunk in death and ruin till they were restored to life by Christ, what shall we 			 say of &#8220;strangers&#8221; (<a name="ix.xv-p30.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012">Eph 2:12</a><a name="ix.xv-p30.1"></A>) who have never been illuminated by the hope of life? When salvation is declared to be shut up in Christ, it clearly implies that the whole human race is devoted to destruction. The cause of this destruction ought also to be observed; for it is not unjustly, or without good reason, that the Heavenly Judge pronounces us to be accursed. The angel 			 declares that we have perished, and are overwhelmed by an awful condemnation, because we stand excluded from life by our sins. Thus we obtain a view of our corruption and depravity; for if any man lived a perfectly holy life, he might do without Christ as a Redeemer. But all to a man need his grace; and, therefore, it follows that they are the slaves of sin, and are destitute of true righteousness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p31"></A>Hence, too, we learn in what way or manner Christ saves; he delivers us from sins This deliverance consists of two parts. Having made a complete atonement, he brings us a free pardon, which delivers us from condemnation to death, and reconciles us to God. Again, by the sanctifying influences of his Spirit, he frees us from the tyranny of Satan, that we may live &#8220;unto 			 righteousness,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xv-p31.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024">1Pe 2:24</a><a name="ix.xv-p31.1"></A>.) Christ is not truly acknowledged as a Savior, till, on the one hand, we learn to receive a free pardon of our sins, and know that we are accounted righteous before God, because we are free from guilt; and till, on the other hand, we ask from him the Spirit of righteousness and holiness, having no confidence whatever in our own works or power. By Christ&#8217;s 			 <i>people</i> the angel unquestionably means the Jews, to whom he was appointed as Head and King; but as the Gentiles were shortly afterwards to be ingrafted into the stock of Abraham, (<a name="ix.xv-p31.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017">Ro 11:17</a><a name="ix.xv-p31.2"></A>,) this promise of <i>salvation</i> is extended indiscriminately to all who are incorporated by faith in the &#8220;one body&#8221; (<a name="ix.xv-p31.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#020">1Co 12:20</a><a name="ix.xv-p31.3"></A>) of the Church.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p32"></A><a name="ix.xv-p32.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p33"></A><b>22. </b><i>Now all this was done</i> It is ignorant and childish trifling to argue, that the name <i>Jesus</i> is given to the Son of God, because he is called <i>Immanuel</i> For Matthew does not confine this assertion to the single fact of the name, but includes whatever is heavenly and divine in the conception of Christ; and that is the reason why he employs the general term <i>all</i> We must now see how appropriately the prediction of Isaiah is applied. It is a well-known 			 and remarkable passage, (<a name="ix.xv-p33.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014">Isa 7:14</a><a name="ix.xv-p33.1"></A>,) but perverted by the Jews with their accustomed malice; though the hatred of Christ and of truth, which they thus discover, is as blind and foolish as it is wicked. To such a pitch of impudence have many of their Rabbins proceeded, as to explain it in reference to King Hezekiah, who was then about fifteen years of age. And what, I ask, must be their 			 rage for lying, when, in order to prevent the admission of clear light, they invert the order of nature, and shut up a youth in his mother&#8217;s womb, that he may be born sixteen years old? But the enemies of Christ deserve that God should strike them with a spirit of giddiness and insensibility, should</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xv-p34"></A>&#8220;pour out upon them a spirit of deep sleep and close their eyes,&#8221; <br> 			 (<a name="ix.xv-p34.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#010">Isa 29:10</a><a name="ix.xv-p34.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p35"></A>Others apply it to a creature of their own fancy, some unknown son of Ahaz, whose birth Isaiah predicted. But with what propriety was he called <i>Immanuel, </i>or the land subjected to his sway, who closed his life in a private station and without honor? for shortly afterwards the prophet tells us that this child, 			 whoever he was, would be ruler of the land. Equally absurd is the notion that this passage relates to the prophet&#8217;s son. On this subject we may remark, that Christian writers have very strangely misapprehended the prediction contained in the next chapter, by applying it to Christ. The prophet there says, that, instructed by a vision, he &#8220;went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son,&#8221; and that the child whom she bore was named by Divine command, &#8221;Maher-shalal-hash-baz,&#8221; &#8220;Making 			 speed to the spoil, hasten the prey,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xv-p35.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#003">Isa 8:3</a><a name="ix.xv-p35.1"></A>.) All that is there described is approaching war, accompanied by fearful desolation; which makes it very manifest that the subjects are totally different.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p36"></A>Let us now, therefore, investigate the true meaning of this passage. The city of Jerusalem is besieged. Ahaz trembles, and is almost dead with terror. The prophet is sent to assure him that God will protect the city. But a simple promise is not sufficient to compose his agitated mind. The prophet is sent to him, saying,</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xv-p37"></A>&#8220;Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God; <br> 			 ask it either in the depth, or in the height above,&#8221; <br> 			 (<a name="ix.xv-p37.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#011">Isa 7:11</a><a name="ix.xv-p37.3"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p38"></A>That wicked hypocrite, concealing his unbelief, disdains to ask a sign. The prophet rebukes him sharply, and at length adds,</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xv-p39"></A>&#8220;The Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel,&#8221; <br> 			 (<a name="ix.xv-p39.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014">Isa 7:14</a><a name="ix.xv-p39.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p40"></A>We expound this as relating to Christ in the following manner: &#8220;You, the whole posterity of David, as far as lies in your power, endeavor to nullify the grace which is promised to you;&#8221; (for the prophet expressly calls them, by way of disgrace, the <i>house of David,</i> <a name="ix.xv-p40.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013">Isa 7:13</a><a name="ix.xv-p40.1"></A>;) &#8220;but your base infidelity will never prevent the truth of God from 			 proving to be victorious. God promises that the city will be preserved safe and unhurt from its enemies. If his word is not enough, he is ready to give you the confirmation of such a sign as you may demand. You reject both favors, and spurn them from you; but God will remain steady to his engagement. For the promised Redeemer will come, in whom God will show himself to be fully present to his people.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p41"></A>The Jews reply, that Isaiah would have been at variance with everything like reason or probability, if he had given to the men of that age a sign, which was not to be exhibited till after the lapse of nearly eight hundred years. And then they assume the airs of haughty triumph,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">103</FONT></A>
 			  as if this objection of the Christians had originated in ignorance or thoughtlessness, and were now forgotten and buried. But the solution, I think, is easy; provided we keep in view that a covenant of adoption was given to the Jews, on which the other acts of the divine kindness depended. There was then a general promise, by which God adopted the children of Abraham as a nation, and on which were founded all the special promises. Again, the foundation of this covenant was the 			 Messiah. Now we hold, that the reason for delivering the city was, that it was the sanctuary of God, and out of it the Redeemer would come. But for this, Jerusalem would a hundred times have perished.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p43"></A>Let pious readers now consider, when the royal family had openly rejected the sign which God had offered to them, if it was not suitable that the prophet should pass all at once to the Messiah, and address them in this manner: &#8220;Though this age is unworthy of the deliverance of which God has given me a promise, yet God is mindful of his covenant, and will rescue this city from its enemies. While he grants no particular sign to testify his 			 grace, this one sign ought to be deemed more than sufficient to meet your wishes. from the stock of David the Messiah will arise.&#8221; Yet it must be observed that, when the prophet reminds unbelievers of the general covenant, it is a sort of reproof, because they did not accept of a particular sign. I have now, I think, proved that, when the door was shut against every kind of miracle, the prophet made an appropriate transition to Christ, for the purpose of leading unbelievers to reflect, that the 			 only cause of the deliverance was the covenant that had been made with their fathers. And by this remarkable example has God been pleased to testify to all ages, that he followed with uninterrupted kindness the children of Abraham, only because in Christ, and not through their own merits, he had made with them a gracious covenant.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p44"></A>There is another piece of sophistry by which the Jews endeavor to parry our argument. Immediately after the words in question, the prophet adds:</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xv-p45"></A>&#8220;Before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings,&#8221; <br> 			 (<a name="ix.xv-p45.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016">Isa 7:16</a><a name="ix.xv-p45.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p46"></A>Hence they infer, that the promised birth of the child would be delayed for a very short time; otherwise, it would not agree with the rapidly approaching change of the kingdoms, which, the prophet announeed, would take place before that child should have passed half the period of infancy. I reply, when Isaiah has given a sign of the future Savior, and declared that a child will be born, who is the true <i>Immanuel, </i>or &#8212; to use 			 Paul&#8217;s language &#8212;<i> God manifest in the flesh,</i> (<a name="ix.xv-p46.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016">1Ti 3:16</a><a name="ix.xv-p46.1"></A>,) he proceeds to speak, in general terms, of all the children of his own time. A strong proof of this readily presents itself; for, after having spoken of the general promise of God, he returns to the special promise, which he had been commissioned to declare. The former passage, which relates to a final and complete redemption, 			 describes one particular child, to whom alone belongs the name of God; while the latter passage, which relates to a special benefit then close at hand, determines the time by the childhood of those who were recently born, or would be born shortly afterwards.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p47"></A>Hitherto, if I mistake not, I have refuted, by strong and conclusive arguments, the calumnies of the Jews, by which they endeavor to prevent the glory of Christ from appearing, with resplendent luster, in this prediction. It now remains for us to refute their sophistical reasoning about the Hebrew word <a name="ix.xv-p47.1"></A>&#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;<i>, 			 virgin</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">104</FONT></A>
 			  They wantonly persecute Matthew for proving that Christ was born of a virgin,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">105</FONT></A>
 			  while the Hebrew noun merely signifies <i>a young woman; </i>and ridicule us for being led astray by the wrong translation   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">106</FONT></A>
 			  of a word, to believe that he was born by the Holy Spirit, of whom the prophet asserts no more than that he would be the son of a young woman. And, first, they display an excessive eagerness for disputation, by laboring   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">107</FONT></A>
 			  to prove that a word, which is uniformly applied in Scripture to <i>virgins, </i>denotes here a young woman who had known a man. The etymology too agrees with Matthew&#8217;s translation of the word: for it means <i>hiding,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">108</FONT></A>
 			  which expresses the modesty that becomes a virgin.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">109</FONT></A>
 			  They produce a passage from the book of Proverbs, &#8220;the way of a man with a maids,&#8221; <a name="ix.xv-p53.2"></A>&#1489;&#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;, (<a name="ix.xv-p53.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#019">Pr 30:19</a><a name="ix.xv-p53.3"></A>.) But it does not at all support their views. Solomon speaks there of a young woman who has obtained the affections of a 			 young man: but it does not follow as a matter of course, that the young man has seduced the object of his regard; or rather, the probability leans much more strongly to the other side.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">110</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p55"></A>But granting all that they ask as to the meaning of the word, the subject demonstrates, and compels the acknowledgment, that the prophet is speaking of a miraculous and extraordinary birth. He exclaims that he is bringing a sign from the Lord, and not an ordinary sign, but one superior to every other.</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xv-p56"></A>The Lord himself shall give you a sign. <br> 			 Behold, a virgin shall conceive, <br> 			 (<a name="ix.xv-p56.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014">Isa 7:14</a><a name="ix.xv-p56.3"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p57"></A>If he were only to say, that a woman would bear a child, how ridiculous would that magnificent preface have been? Thus we see, that the insolence of the Jews exposes not only themselves, but the sacred mysteries of God, to scorn.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p58"></A>Besides, a powerful argument may be drawn from the whole strain of the passage. <i>Behold, a virgin shall conceive</i> Why is no mention made of a man? It is because the prophet draws our attention to something very uncommon. Again, the virgin is commanded to name the child. <i>Thou shalt call his name Immanuel</i> In this respect, also, the prophet expresses something extraordinary: for, though it is frequently related in Scripture, that the names were given to children by their mothers, yet it was done by the authority of the fathers. When the prophet addresses his discourse to the virgin, he takes away from men, in respect to this child, that authority which is conferred upon them by the order 			 of nature. Let this, therefore, be regarded as an established truth, that the prophet here refers to a remarkable miracle of God, and recommends it to the attentive and devout consideration of all the godly, &#8212; a miracle which is basely profaned by the Jews, who apply to the ordinary method of conception what is said in reference to the secret power of the Spirit.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p59"></A><a name="ix.xv-p59.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p60"></A><b>23. </b><i>His name Immanuel</i> The phrase, <i>God is with us, </i>is no doubt frequently employed in Scripture to denote, that he is present with us by his assistance and grace, and displays the power of his hand 			 in our defense. But here we are instructed as to the <i>manner</i> in which God communicates with men. For out of Christ we are alienated from him; but through Christ we are not only received into his favor, but are made one with him. When Paul says, that the Jews under the law <i>were nigh</i> to God, (<a name="ix.xv-p60.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017">Eph 2:17</a><a name="ix.xv-p60.1"></A>,) and that a deadly <i>enmity</i> (<a name="ix.xv-p60.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015">Eph 2:15</a><a name="ix.xv-p60.2"></A>) subsisted between him and the Gentiles, he means only that, by shadows and figures, God then gave to the people whom he had adopted the tokens of his presence. That promise was 			 still in force, &#8220;The Lord thy God is among you,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xv-p60.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#021">De 7:21</a><a name="ix.xv-p60.3"></A>,) and, &#8220;This is my rest for ever,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xv-p60.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014">Ps 132:14</a><a name="ix.xv-p60.4"></A>.) But while the familiar intercourse between God and the people depended on a Mediator, what had not yet fully taken place was shadowed out by symbols. His seat 			 and residence is placed &#8220;between the Cherubim,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xv-p60.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001">Ps 80:1</a><a name="ix.xv-p60.5"></A>,) because the ark was the figure and visible pledge of his glory.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p61"></A>But in Christ the actual presence of God with his people, and not, as before, his shadowy presence, has been exhibited.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">111</FONT></A>
 			  This is the reason, why Paul says, that &#8220;in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xv-p62.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009">Col 2:9</a><a name="ix.xv-p62.2"></A>.) And certainly he would not be a properly qualified Mediator, if he did not unite both natures in his person, and thus bring men into an alliance with God. Nor is there any force in the objection, about which the Jews make a good deal of noise, that the name of God is frequently 			 applied to those memorials, by which he testified that he was present with believers.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p63"></A>For it cannot be denied, that this name, <i>Immanuel, </i>contains an implied contrast between the presence of God, as exhibited in Christ, with every other kind of presence, which was manifested to the ancient people before his coming. If the reason of this name began to be actually true, when Christ appeared in the 			 flesh, it follows that it was not completely, but only in part, that God was formerly united with the Fathers.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p64"></A>Hence arises another proof, that Christ is <i>God manifested in the flesh,</i> (<a name="ix.xv-p64.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016">1Ti 3:16</a><a name="ix.xv-p64.1"></A>.) He discharged, indeed, the office of Mediator from the beginning of the world; but as this depended wholly on the latest revelation, he is justly called 			 Immanuel at that time, when clothed, as it were, with a new character, he appears in public as a Priest, to atone for the sins of men by the sacrifice of his body, to reconcile them to the Father by the price of his blood, and, in a word, to fulfill every part of the salvation of men.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">112</FONT></A>
 			  The first thing which we ought to consider in this name is the divine majesty of Christ, so as to yield to him the reverence which is due to the only and eternal God. But we must not, at the same time, forget the fruit which God intended that we should collect and receive from this name. For whenever we contemplate the one person of Christ as God-man, we ought to hold it for certain that, if we are united to Christ by faith, we possess 			 God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p66"></A>In the words, <i>they shall call, </i>there is a change of the number. But this is not at all at variance with what I have already said. True, the prophet addresses the virgin alone, and therefore uses the second person, <i>Thou shalt call</i> But from the time that this name was published, all the godly have an equal right to make this confession, that God has given himself to us to be enjoyed in Christ.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">113</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p68"></A><a name="ix.xv-p68.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p69"></A><b>24. </b><i>Joseph, being raised from sleep</i> The ready performance, which is here described, serves not less to attest the certainty of Joseph&#8217;s faith, than to commend his obedience. For, if every scruple had not been removed, and his conscience fully pacified, he would never have proceeded so cheerfully, on a sudden 			 change of opinion, <i>to take unto him his wife, </i>whose society, he lately thought, would pollute him.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">114</FONT></A>
 			  The dream must have carried some mark of Divinity, which did not allow his mind to hesitate. Next followed the effect of faith. Having learned the will of God, he instantly prepared himself to obey.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p71"></A><a name="ix.xv-p71.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xv-p72"></A><b>25. </b><i>And knew her not</i> This passage afforded the pretext for great disturbances, which were introduced into the Church, at a former period, by Helvidius. The inference he drew from it was, that Mary remained a virgin no longer than till her first birth, and that afterwards she had other 			 children by her husband. Jerome, on the other hand, earnestly and copiously defended Mary&#8217;s perpetual virginity. Let us rest satisfied with this, that no just and well-grounded inference can be drawn from these words of the Evangelist, as to what took place after the birth of Christ. He is called <i>first-born; </i>but it is for the sole purpose of informing us that he was born of a 			 virgin.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">115</FONT></A>
 			  It is said that Joseph <i>knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born son: </i>but this is limited to that very time. What took place afterwards, the historian does not inform us. Such is well known to have been the practice of the inspired writers. Certainly, no man will ever raise a question on this subject, except from 			 curiosity; and no man will obstinately keep up the argument, except from an extreme fondness for disputation.</p>
