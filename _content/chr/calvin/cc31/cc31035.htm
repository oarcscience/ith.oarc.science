<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p11"></A><b><a name="ix.xxvii-p11.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001">Mark 1:1</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p11.2"></A>.</b> <i>The beginning of the Gospel.</i> Though what we have hitherto taken out of Matthew and Luke is a part of <i>the Gospel, </i>yet it is not without reason that Mark makes <i>the beginning 			 of the Gospel </i>to be the preaching of John the Baptist. For the Law and the Prophets then came to an end, (<a name="ix.xxvii-p11.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017">Joh 1:17</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p11.3"></A>.) &#8220;<i>The Law and the Prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached</i>,&#8221; <b>(</b><a name="ix.xxvii-p11.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#016">Lu 16:16</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p11.4"></A><b>.)</b> And with this agrees most fully the quotation which he makes from the Prophet Malachi, (<a name="ix.xxvii-p11.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001">Mal 3:1</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p11.5"></A>.) In order to inflame the minds of his people with a stronger desire of the promised salvation, the Lord had determined to leave them, for a time, without new prophecies. We know that the last of the true and 			 lawful prophets was Malachi.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p12"></A>That the Jews, in the meantime, may not faint with hunger, he exhorts them to continue under the Law of Moses, until the promised redemption appear. He mentions <i>the law </i>only, (<a name="ix.xxvii-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017">Joh 1:17</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p12.1"></A>,) because the doctrine of the Prophets was not separate from the law, but was merely an appendage and fuller exposition of it, that the form of government in the 			 Church might depend entirely on the Law. It is no new or uncommon thing in Scripture, to include the Prophets under the name of <i>the Law: </i>for they were all related to it as their fountain or design. The Gospel was not an inferior appendage to the Law, but a new form of instruction, by which the former was set aside.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p13"></A>Malachi, distinguishing the two conditions of the Church, places the one under the Law, and commences the other with the preaching of John. He unquestionably describes the Baptist, when he says, &#8220;Behold, I send my messenger,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xxvii-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001">Mal 3:1</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p13.1"></A>:) for, as we have already said, that passage lays down an express distinction between the Law and the new order 			 and condition of the Church. With the same view he had said a little before, (which is quoted by Mark, [<a name="ix.xxvii-p13.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#013">Mr 9:13</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p13.2"></A>;] for the passages are quite similar,) &#8220;Behold, I send you Elijah the Prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xxvii-p13.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005">Mal 4:5</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p13.3"></A>.) Again,</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xxvii-p14"></A>&#8220;Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xxvii-p14.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001">Mal 3:1</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p14.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p15"></A>In both passages, the Lord promises a better condition of his Church than had existed under the Law, and this unquestionably points out <i>the beginning of the Gospel</i> But <i>before the Lord came</i> to restore the Church, a forerunner or herald was to come, and announce that he was at hand. Hence we infer, that the abrogation of the Law, and <i>the beginning of the Gospel, </i>strictly speaking, took place when John began to preach.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p16"></A>The Evangelist John presents to us Christ clothed in flesh, &#8220;the Word made flesh,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xxvii-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014">Joh 1:14</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p16.1"></A>;) so that his birth and the whole history of his appearance are included in the Gospel. But here Mark inquires, when the Gospel began to be published, and, therefore, properly begins with John, who was its first minister. And with this view the Heavenly Father chose 			 that the life of his Son should be buried, as it were, in silence, until the time of the full revelation arrived. For it did not happen without the undoubted Providence of God, that the Evangelists leave out the whole period which Christ spent in private, and pass at once from his earliest infancy to his thirtieth year, when he was openly exhibited to the world, invested with his public character as a Redeemer; Luke excepted, who slightly touches one indication of his future calling, which 			 occurred about his twelfth year, <b>(</b><a name="ix.xxvii-p16.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#042">Lu 2:42</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p16.2"></A><b>.)</b></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p17"></A>It had a very close connection with this object, that we should be informed, first, that Christ is a true man, (<a name="ix.xxvii-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014">Joh 1:14</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p17.1"></A>,) and next, that he is &#8220;<i>the Son of Abraham and of David</i>,&#8221;<b> (</b><a name="ix.xxvii-p17.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001">Mt 1:1</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p17.2"></A><b>;)</b> as to both of which, the Lord has been pleased to give us an attestation. The other matters which we have examined, relating to <i>&#8220;the shepherds</i>,&#8221; <b>(</b><a name="ix.xxvii-p17.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#008">Lu 2:8</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p17.3"></A><b>,)</b> the <i>&#8220;Magi,&#8221;</i> <b>(</b><a name="ix.xxvii-p17.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001">Mt 2:1</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p17.4"></A><b>,)</b> and <i>&#8220;Simeon,&#8221; </i><b>(</b><a name="ix.xxvii-p17.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025">Lu 2:25</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p17.5"></A><b>,)</b> were intended to prove his Divinity. What Luke relates about John and his father Zacharias, <b>(</b><a name="ix.xxvii-p17.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005">Lu 1:5</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p17.6"></A><b>,)</b> was a 			 sort of preparation for the Gospel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p18"></A>There is no impropriety in the change of the person which is here made, in quoting the words of Malachi. According to the prophet, God says, <i>I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way Before Me</i>. Mark introduces God as addressing the Son, <i>Behold, 			 I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way Before Thee</i>. But we see that Mark had no other intention, than to express more clearly the prophet&#8217;s meaning. Mark designates Christ <i>the Son of God</i> The other Evangelists testify that he was born of the seed of Abraham and David, and therefore was 			 <i>the Son of man, </i><b>(</b><a name="ix.xxvii-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020">Mt 8:20</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p18.1"></A><b>.)</b> But Mark shows us, that no redemption is to be expected but from <i>the Son of God</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p19"></A><a name="ix.xxvii-p19.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p20"></A><b><a name="ix.xxvii-p20.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001">Matthew 3:1</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p20.2"></A></b> <i>Now in those days</i> <b><a name="ix.xxvii-p20.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001">Luke 3:1</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p20.3"></A>.</b> <i>And in the fifteenth year</i> It could not be gathered from Matthew and 			 Mark in what year of his age John began to preach: but Luke shows sufficiently, that he was about thirty years of age. The ancient writers of the Church are almost unanimously agreed, that he was born fifteen years before the death of Augustus. His successor Tiberius had held the government of the Roman Empire for fifteen years, when the same John began to preach. In this way are made up the thirty years which I have mentioned. Hence it follows, that he did not long discharge the office of 			 teacher, but, in a short time, gave way to Christ; for we shall soon find, that Christ also was baptized in the thirtieth year of his age, when he was immediately installed into the discharge of his public office. Now as John, the morning-star, or dawn, was immediately followed by Christ, &#8220;the Sun of Righteousness,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xxvii-p20.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002">Mal 4:2</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p20.4"></A>,) there is no reason to wonder, that John disappeared, in 			 order that Christ might shine alone in greater brightness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p21"></A><a name="ix.xxvii-p21.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p22"></A><b><a name="ix.xxvii-p22.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001">Luke 3:1</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p22.2"></A>.</b> <i>When Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea</i> It is probable that this was the second year of Pilate&#8217;s government: for since Tiberius had held the reins of government, he had, as Josephus informs us, (xviii. 2:2,) appointed Valerius Gratus to be 			 governor of Judea, in room of Annius Rufus. This change might take place in his second year. The same Josephus writes, that Valerius was governor of Judea for &#8220;eleven years, when Pontius Pilate came as his successor,&#8221; (Ant. 18:2:2.) Pilate, therefore, had governed the province for two years, when John began to preach the Gospel. This Herod, whom Luke makes tetrarch of Judea, was the second heir of Herod the Great, and succeeded to his father by will. Archelaus had received the ethnarchy of 			 Judea, but, when he was banished to Vienna (Jos. Wars, 2, vii. 3) by Augustus, that portion fell into the hands of the Romans. Luke mentions here two sons of Herod, &#8212; Herod Antipas, who had been made tetrarch of Galilee, and governed Samaria and Peraea, &#8212; and Philip, who was tetrarch of Trachonitis and Iturea, and reigned from the sea of Tiberias, or Gennesareth, to the foot of Lebanon, which is the source of the river Jordan.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p23"></A>Lysanias has been falsely supposed to be the son of Ptolemy Mennaeus, King of Chalcis, who had been long before put to death by Cleopatra, about thirty years before the birth of Christ, as Josephus relates, (Ant. 15:4:1.) He could hardly even be the grandson of Ptolemy, who, as the same Josephus records, kindled the Parthian war, (Wars, 1, xiii. 1;) for then he must have been more than sixty years of age at the time of which Luke speaks. 			 Besides, as it was under Antigonus that the Parthian war commenced, he must even then have been a full-grown man. Now Ptolemy Mennaeus died not long after the murder of Julius Caesar, during the triumvirate of Lepidus, Antony, and Octavius, (Jos. Wars, 1, xiii. 1.) But as this grandson of Ptolemy bore the name of Lysanias as well as his father, he might have left a son who had the same surname. Meanwhile, there can be no hesitation in rejecting the error of those who make Lysanias to live sixty 			 years after he had been slain by Cleopatra.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p24"></A>The word <i>Tetrarch</i> is here used in a sense not quite accurate, as if the whole country had been divided into four parts. But as at first there was a fourfold division into districts, so afterwards, when other changes took place, the names <i>Tetrarch </i>and 			 <i>Tetrarchies </i>were retained by way of honor. In this sense Pliny enumerates seventeen <i>tetrarchies </i>of one country.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p25"></A><a name="ix.xxvii-p25.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p26"></A><b><a name="ix.xxvii-p26.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002">Luke 3:2</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p26.1"></A>.</b> <i>Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests</i> It is certain, that there never were two persons who held the office of <i>high priest </i>at the same time. Josephus states, that Valerius Gratus made Caiaphas <i>high priest, </i>a short time before he left the government. During the time that Pilate was governor of Judea, Josephus does not speak of him as having made any change in this respect;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_243"></A><A HREF="#fn_243"><FONT SIZE="1">244</FONT></A>
 			  but, on the contrary, states that, when Pilate had been recalled from the government, and sent to plead his cause at Rome, Vitellius, who was at that time governor of Syria, reduced Caiaphas to a private rank, and transferred the high priesthood to Jonathan, the son of Ananus, (Ant. 18:4:3.) When Luke says that there were two <i>high priests, </i>we must not understand him to mean, that both held 			 the same title, but that the honor of the priesthood was partly shared with him by Annas his father-in-law. Luke&#8217;s narrative indicates such a state of trouble and confusion, that, though there was not more than one person who was actually <i>high priest, </i>the sacred office was torn in pieces by ambition and tyranny.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p28"></A><i>The word of the Lord came upon John</i> Before relating, as the other Evangelists do, that John began to exercise his office of teaching, Luke asserts that he was divinely called to that office: and he does so, in order to assure us, that the ministry of John carried undoubted authority. Why the interpreters have chosen to translate 			 the word, <a name="ix.xxvii-p28.1"></A>&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#8127;&#921;&#969;&#8049;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#957;, <i>UPON John, </i>instead of <i>TO John, </i>I do not see: but because there is no ambiguity as to the meaning, that this commission was entrusted to him, 			 and that he received a command to preach, I have followed the received version. Hence infer, that there are no regular teachers, but those on whom God has conferred the office; and that it is not enough to have the word of God, if there be not likewise a special calling.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p29"></A>Matthew and Mark do not speak of the preaching of John as extending beyond <i>the wilderness, </i>while Luke says, that he <i>came into all the country around Jordan</i> These statements may be 			 reconciled by observing, that John discharged the office of teaching among the neighbors, with whom he dwelt; but that his Gospel spread more widely, and became known in many places, so that the report of it, in a short time, reached Jerusalem. Indeed, the whole of that tract of the Jordan might be called a <i>wilderness: </i>for the word does not mean &#8220;a solitude,&#8221; but &#8220;a rough, and 			 mountainous, and thinly inhabited district.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p30"></A><a name="ix.xxvii-p30.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p31"></A><b><a name="ix.xxvii-p31.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002">Matthew 3:2</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p31.2"></A>. </b><i>Repent ye</i> Matthew differs from the other two Evangelists in this respect, that he relates the substance of John&#8217;s doctrine, as uttered by John himself, while they relate it in their own words; though Mark has one word more than Luke: for he says, <i>he came Baptizing, and preaching the baptism of repentance</i> But in substance there is the most perfect agreement: for they all connect <i>repentance </i>with <i>the forgiveness of sins. </i>The<i> 			 kingdom of God </i>among men is nothing else than a restoration to a happy life; or, in other words, it is true and everlasting happiness. When John says, that <i>the kingdom of God is at hand, </i>his meaning is, that men, who were alienated from the righteousness of God, and banished from <i>the kingdom of 			 heaven, </i>must be again gathered to God, and live under his guidance. This is accomplished by a free adoption and <i>the forgiveness of sins, </i>by which he reconciles to himself those who were unworthy. In a word, the kingdom of heaven is nothing else than &#8220;newness of life,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xxvii-p31.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004">Ro 6:4</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p31.3"></A>,) by which God restores us to the hope of a blessed immortality. Having rescued us from the bondage of sin and death, he claims us as his own; that, even while our pilgrimage on earth continues, we may enjoy the heavenly life by faith: for he</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xxvii-p32"></A>&#8220;hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ,&#8221; <br> 			 (<a name="ix.xxvii-p32.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003">Eph 1:3</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p32.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p33"></A>Though we are like dead men, yet we know that our life is secure; for it &#8220;is hid with Christ in God,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xxvii-p33.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003">Col 3:3</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p33.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p34"></A>From this doctrine, as its source, is drawn the exhortation to <i>repentance. </i>For John does not say, &#8220;Repent ye, and in this way <i>the kingdom of heaven</i> will afterwards be <i>at hand;&#8221; </i>but first brings forward the grace of God, and then exhorts men to <i>repent</i> Hence it is evident, that the foundation of repentance is the mercy of God, by which he restores the lost. In no other sense is it stated by Mark and Luke, that he <i>preached repentance for the forgiveness of 			 sins</i> Repentance is not placed first, as some ignorantly suppose, as if it were the ground of the forgiveness of sins, or as if it induced God to begin to be gracious to us; but men are commanded to repent, that they may receive the reconciliation which is offered to them. Now, as the undeserved love of God &#8212; by which he receives into his favor wretched men, &#8220;not imputing their trespasses unto them,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xxvii-p34.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019">2Co 5:19</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p34.1"></A>) &#8212; is first in order; so it must be observed, that pardon of sins is bestowed upon us in Christ, not that God may treat them with indulgence, but that he may heal us from our sins. And, indeed, without hatred of sin and remorse for transgressions, no man will taste the grace of God. But a definition of <i>repentance </i>and 			 <i>faith </i>may explain more fully the manner in which both are connected; which leads me to handle this doctrine more sparingly.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p35"></A>With regard to the meaning of the present passage, it is proper to observe, that the whole Gospel consists of two parts, &#8212;<i> forgiveness of sins, </i>and <i>repentance</i> Now, as Matthew denominates 			 the first of these <i>the kingdom of heaven, </i>we may conclude, that men are in a state of deadly enmity with God, and altogether shut out from the heavenly kingdom, till God receives them into favor. Though John, when he introduces the mention of the grace of God, exhorts men to repentance, yet it must not be forgotten that repentance, not less than the inheritance of the heavenly 			 kingdom, is the gift of God. As he freely pardons our sins, and delivers us, by his mercy, from the condemnation of eternal death, so also does he form us anew to his image, that we may live unto righteousness. As he freely adopts us for his sons, so he regenerates us by his Spirit, that our life may testify, that we do not falsely,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_244"></A><A HREF="#fn_244"><FONT SIZE="1">245</FONT></A>
 			  address him as our Father. In like manner, Christ washes away our sins by his blood, and reconciles our Heavenly Father to us by the sacrifice of his death; but, at the same time, in consequence of</p>

<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p38"></A>he makes us &#8220;alive&#8221; unto righteousness. The sum of the Gospel is, that God, through his Son, takes away our sins, and admits us to fellowship with him, that we, <i>&#8220;denying ourselves</i>&#8221; and our own nature, may &#8220;live soberly, righteously, and godly,&#8221; and thus may exercise ourselves on earth in meditating on the 			 heavenly life.</p>

A sacrament, then, is not a dumb ceremony, exhibiting some unmeaning pomp without doctrine; but the Word of God is joined to it, and gives life to the outward ceremony. By <i>the Word</i> I mean, not mutterings of a magical character, made by some exorcist between his teeth, but what is pronounced with a clear and 			 distinct voice, and leads to the edification of faith. For we are not simply told, that John <i>baptized unto repentance, </i>as if the grace of God were contained in a visible sign; but that he explained, in his preaching, the advantage of baptism, that the sign, through the word preached, might produce its effect. This is the peculiarity of baptism, that it is said to be an outward 			 representation of <i>repentance for the forgiveness of sins</i> Now, as the meaning, power, and nature of that baptism are the same as ours, if we judge of the figure from its true import, it is incorrect to say, that the baptism of John is different from the baptism of Christ.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_245"></A><A HREF="#fn_245"><FONT SIZE="1">246</FONT></A>

After having spoken of the destruction of 			 the city, and of the awful calamities that would befall the people, he promises a restoration that would follow. His words are,</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xxvii-p44"></A>&#8220;Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God,&#8221; <br> 			 (<a name="ix.xxvii-p44.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001">Isa 40:1</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p44.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p45"></A>When the temple had been thrown down, and sacrifices abolished, and the people led away into captivity, their affairs seemed to be desperate. And as their ears had been deaf to the uninterrupted voice of the prophets, the Lord kept silence for a time.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_246"></A><A HREF="#fn_246"><FONT SIZE="1">247</FONT></A>
 			  That pious minds may not be cast down during this melancholy silence, the prophet announces, that other preachers of grace will yet arise, to awaken in the people a hope of salvation. Such were Zechariah, Haggai, Malachi, and the like.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_247"></A><A HREF="#fn_247"><FONT SIZE="1">248</FONT></A>
 			  But as the restoration promised is perpetual, and not for a time only, and as Isaiah refers chiefly to the redemption, which was to be expressed at the coming of Christ, John the Baptist is justly considered the chief minister of consolation.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p48"></A>Next follows in the words of the prophet, <i>The voice of one crying</i> That <i>voice</i> is contrasted with the temporary silence,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_248"></A><A HREF="#fn_248"><FONT SIZE="1">249</FONT></A>
 			  which I have just mentioned: for the Jews were to be deprived, for a time, of the instruction, which they had wickedly despised. The word <i>wilderness</i> is here used metaphorically for <i>desolation, </i>or the frightful 			 ruin of the nation, such as existed in the time of the captivity. It was so dismally shattered, that it might well be compared to a <i>wilderness</i> The prophet magnifies the grace of God. &#8220;Though the people,&#8221; says he, &#8220;have been driven far from their country, and even excluded from the society of men, yet the voice of God will yet be heard in <i>the wilderness, </i>to revive the dead with joyful consolation.&#8221; When John began to preach, Jerusalem was in this sense a <i>wilderness: </i>for all had been reduced to wild and frightful confusion. But the very sight of a visible <i>wilderness</i> must have had a powerful effect on stupid and hardened men, leading them to perceive that they were in a state of death, and to accept the promise of salvation, which had been held out to them. We now see, that this prediction actually relates to John, and is most properly applied to him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p50"></A><i>Prepare the way of the Lord</i> The prophet undoubtedly addresses Cyrus and the Persians, whose agency the Lord employed in this matter. The meaning is: by his wonderful power, God will open a way to his people through impassable forests, through broken rocks, through a sandy desert; for he will have at hand the ministers of his 			 grace, to remove all hindrances out of the way. But that was a shadowy anticipation of redemption. When the spiritual truth is about to appear, John is sent to remove obstacles. And even now the same voice sounds in our ears, that we may <i>prepare the way of the Lord: </i>that is, that we may take out of the way those sins which obstruct the kingdom of Christ, and thus may give access 			 to his grace. To the same purpose are the following words of the prophet: <i>the crooked shall be made straight,</i> (<a name="ix.xxvii-p50.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#004">Isa 40:4</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p50.1"></A>.) All that they mean is: there are intricate and crooked windings in the world, but through such appalling difficulties the Lord makes a way for himself, and breaks through, by incredible 			 means, to accomplish our salvation.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p51"></A><a name="ix.xxvii-p51.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p52"></A><b><a name="ix.xxvii-p52.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#006">Luke 3:6</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p52.2"></A></b> <i>And all flesh shall see the salvation of God</i> That salvation will not be at all obscure, or experienced by a small number of persons, but will strike every eye, and will be common to all. Hence it follows that this prediction was far from being 			 accomplished, when the people returned from Babylon:   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_249"></A><A HREF="#fn_249"><FONT SIZE="1">250</FONT></A>
 			  for though the Lord gave, at that time, a memorable display of his grace, yet he did not reveal his <i>salvation</i> to the whole world. On the contrary, the prophet&#8217;s design was, to present the uncommon excellence of the salvation which was to be manifested, in contrast with God&#8217;s former benefits, and thus to inform believers, that 			 the dispensations of God towards his Church had never been so remarkable, nor his power so illustriously displayed in their deliverance. <i>Flesh</i> is here put for <i>men, </i>without being intended to denote their depravity.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_250"></A><A HREF="#fn_250"><FONT SIZE="1">251</FONT></A>

And he mentions this, not only to inform us, that John was satisfied with the food and dress of the peasants, and partook of no delicacies; but that, under a mean and contemptible garb, he was held in high estimation by men of rank and splendor. Superstitious persons look upon righteousness as consisting almost entirely of outward appearances, 			 and have commonly thought, that abstinence of this kind was the perfection of holiness. Nearly akin to this is the error, of supposing him to be a man who lived in solitude, and who disdained the ordinary way of living; as the only superiority of hermits and monks is, that they differ from other people. Nay<i>, </i>gross ignorance has gone so far that, out of <i>camel&#8217;s hair</i> they have made an entire skin.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p57"></A>Now, there can be no doubt, that the Evangelist here describes a man of the mountains,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_251"></A><A HREF="#fn_251"><FONT SIZE="1">252</FONT></A>
 			  widely distant from all the refinement and delicacies of towns,&#8212;not only satisfied with such food as could be procured, but eating only what was fit to be used in its natural state, such as <i>wild honey, </i>which is supplied by that region in great abundance, and <i>locusts, </i>with which it also abounds. Or he may have intended to point out that, when a man of mean aspect, and without any polite accomplishments, appeared in public life, it was attended by this advantage, that the majesty of God shone alone in him, and yet struck all with admiration. For we must observe what is added, that there was a great concourse of people from all directions; from which we infer, that his fame was 			 very widely spread.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_252"></A><A HREF="#fn_252"><FONT SIZE="1">253</FONT></A>
 			  Or the Evangelist may have signified the design of God, to present, in the person of John, a singular instance of frugality, and, in this manner, to fill the Jews with reverence for his doctrine, or at least to convince them of ingratitude, according to that saying of our Lord, <i>John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine,</i> (<a name="ix.xxvii-p59.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#033">Lu 7:33</a><a name="ix.xxvii-p59.2"></A>.)</p>

In <i>Baptism, </i>he declares that our sins are forgiven, and calls us to repentance. That men may come 			 forward, in a right manner, to be baptized, <i>confession of sins</i> is demanded from them: otherwise the whole performance would be nothing but an idle mockery   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_253"></A><A HREF="#fn_253"><FONT SIZE="1">254</FONT></A>

</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxvii-p65"></A>Hence it is obvious, how absurdly this passage has been tortured by the Papists, to support auricular confession.

 			  his sins; nor is it said that they enumerated all their sins; nor are we told that John left in charge to his disciples an ordinary rule for confession.

 			  and will have no place after Baptism. At all events, the law which they lay down for confession after Baptism, derives no countenance from John&#8217;s example.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_258"><FONT SIZE="1">259</FONT></A>
