 			  was of such a nature, that Christ wished the disciples to traverse the whole of Judea within a few days, and immediately to return to him, he forbids to carry luggage with them, by which this speed may be retarded. Some have ignorantly supposed that the rule here laid down for the ministers of the word, or for the apostles, is perpetual. We shall presently meet with a few sentences which have a more extensive reference: but the present injunctions not to carry 			 baggage must undoubtedly be restricted to that temporary commission of which I have already spoken. The whole of the prohibition of <i>gold, silver, a scrip, </i>and two <i>coats, </i>which is given by Matthew, must be read in immediate connection, as is evident from the other two Evangelists.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p13"></A>I have therefore chosen to translate <a name="ix.lxxxiv-p13.1"></A>&#965;&#8052; &#954;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#951;&#963;&#952;&#949;, <i>do not provide: </i>for our Lord simply intended to forbid them to <i>take any thing for the journey</i>  They might have <i>scrips, </i>and <i>shoes, </i>and <i>a change of coats, </i>at home; but that they may be better prepared for the journey, he orders them to leave every thing that would be burdensome. Such too is the import of what Mark says, <i>to be shod with sandals</i>  There is an appearance of 			 contradiction as to the <i>staff, </i>or <i>stick</i> for, according to Mark, the <i>staff </i>is allowed, while according to Matthew and Luke it is refused. But there is an ambiguity in the use of the Hebrew word <a name="ix.lxxxiv-p13.2"></A>&#1513;&#1489;&#1496;, <i>(shebet;) </i>and the Evangelists, though they wrote in Greek, used the word <a name="ix.lxxxiv-p13.3"></A>&#8165;&#945;&#769;&#946;&#948;&#959;&#962; in various senses. Matthew and Luke mean by it a <i>rod </i>which would be burdensome to the person who carries it: while 			 Mark means by it a <i>walking-stick </i>to support and relieve a traveler. It is evident, that in making a journey it was customary to carry a <i>staff; </i>and hence those words of Jacob, <i>With my staff, I passed over this Jordan,</i> (<a name="ix.lxxxiv-p13.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#010">Ge 32:10</a><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p13.4"></A>,) by which he acknowledges that he came empty and without money into Syria.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p14"></A><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p14.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p15"></A><b>10. </b><i>For the laborer is worthy of his food.</i> Christ anticipates an objection that might be made: for it might appear to be a harsh condition to travel through the whole of Judea without any provisions.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_575"></A><A HREF="#fn_575"><FONT SIZE="1">576</FONT></A>
 			  Accordingly, Christ tells them, that they have no reason to dread that they will suffer hunger; because, wherever they come, they will at least be <i>worthy of their food</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_576"></A><A HREF="#fn_576"><FONT SIZE="1">577</FONT></A>
 			  He calls them <i>laborers, </i>not that they resembled ordinary ministers, who labor in the Lord&#8217;s vineyard, and who, by planting and watering, bring it into a state of cultivation; but merely because they were the heralds of a richer and more complete doctrine. They did not at that time receive the office of preaching any farther than to render the Jews attentive to the preaching of the Gospel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p18"></A><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p18.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p19"></A><b>11. </b><i>Inquire what person in it is worthy.</i> Again, they might object that they would be deprived of the food to which they were entitled, because nobody would acknowledge them as <i>laborers</i>  But Christ meets this difficulty also by ordering them to make <i>inquiry what person </i>in each city is <i>worthy </i>of the message of salvation. By these words, he bids them ask, if there are any godly and upright men, who have some fear and reverence for God, and of whose readiness to receive instruction good hopes may be entertained, that they may direct their labors chiefly to them. For, as 			 they were not at liberty to remain long in any one place, it was proper to begin with those who, in some respect were better prepared.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p20"></A><i>Remain there till you depart.</i> This too has a reference to dispatch: for if they had made a longer stay in any place, it would have been necessary to change their lodging, that they might not be too burdensome to any individual. When, therefore, Christ enjoins them to remain in the house of the person who shall first receive them, 			 <i>till they depart </i>to another city, he intimates that they must make haste, so that, after having published the Gospel in one city, they may immediately run to another.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p21"></A><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p21.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p22"></A><b>12. </b><i>Salute it.</i> As they could not distinguish the devout worshippers of God from despisers, he enjoins them to address in a friendly manner any family which they may have occasion to meet. The act of <i>saluting </i>is a kind of opening to a conversation. They had 			 already been warned to look out for persons to entertain them, whose religious zeal was generally known and believed. But as it sometimes happens that persons of lofty reputation, when they are brought to a serious trial, discover their impiety, it was proper that this rule should be expressly laid down. The meaning therefore is: &#8220;Make trial, when you first enter, whether your entertainers will cheerfully submit to hear you. Whoever shall willingly embrace your doctrine, remain in their house, 			 that your salutation may be confirmed. If any shall reject, depart from them immediately, and, so far as lies in your power, withdraw your salutation.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p24"></A><b>13. </b><i>If it be not worthy.</i> The import of this mode of expression may be thus stated, &#8212; &#8220;As their ingratitude makes them unworthy to enjoy the blessing of God which you have supplicated for them, break off every bond of communication.&#8221; The <i>word peace 			 </i>refers to the mode of salutation which generally used among the Jews. As the Hebrew word <a name="ix.lxxxiv-p24.2"></A>&#1513;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, <i>(shalom,) peace, </i>denotes <i>prosperity, </i>when they desire that any one may be well and happy, and that his affairs may 			 succeed to his wish, they pray that he may have <i>peace</i>  I do acknowledge that the apostles brought to men a different kind of peace, but it is too great a refinement of speculation to make this passage refer to the free reconciliation which takes place between God and men.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p25"></A><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p25.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p26"></A><b>14. </b><i>And whoever will not receive you.</i> This awful threatening of punishment against the despisers of the gospel was intended to animate his disciples, that they might not be retarded by the ingratitude of the world. He directs the apostles, indeed, what 			 he wishes them to do if they meet with despisers. But his principal design was that, wherever their doctrine was rejected, their well-founded grief and distress might be relieved by consolation, that they might not fail in the middle of their course. And we see how Paul, relying on this consolation, boldly sets at naught all the obstinacy of men, moves on steadily in the midst of hindrances, and boasts that he is</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p27"></A>a sweet savor to God, though he is the savor of death <br> 			 to them that perish, (<a name="ix.lxxxiv-p27.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015">2 Cor. 2:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016">16</a><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p27.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p28"></A>Now, this passage shows in what estimation the Lord holds his gospel, and, indeed, as it is an inestimable treasure, they are chargeable with base ingratitude who refuse it when offered to them. Besides, it is the scepter of his kingdom, and therefore cannot be rejected without treating him with open contempt.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p29"></A><i>Shake off the dust</i>  As the Lord here recommends the doctrine of the gospel, that all may receive it with reverence, and terrifies rebels by threatening severe punishment, so he enjoins the apostles to proclaim the vengeance which he threatens. But this they cannot do, unless they burn with very ardent 			 zeal to make known the doctrines which they preach. We must therefore hold that no man is qualified to become a teacher of heavenly doctrine, unless his feelings respecting it be such, that he is distressed and agonized when it is treated with contempt.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p30"></A>To <i>shake off the dust from the feet</i> was probably a custom then prevalent in Judea, as a sign of execration; and was intended to declare that the inhabitants of the place were so polluted, that the very ground on which they trod was infected. That it was an ordinary custom I conjecture from our Lord&#8217;s 			 manner of speaking of it as a thing well known. This form of execration confirms still more what I lately mentioned, that no crime is more offensive to God than contempt of his word: for he does not enjoin them to make use of so solemn a mode in expressing their detestation of adulterers, or murderers, or any description of malefactors.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p31"></A><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p31.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxxiv-p32"></A><i>Verily, I say to you</i>  That they may not imagine this to be an idle bugbear,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_577"></A><A HREF="#fn_577"><FONT SIZE="1">578</FONT></A>
 			  Christ declares that those who reject the gospel, will receive more severe punishment than the inhabitants of Sodom. Some view the word <i>judgment</i> as referring to the destruction of Jerusalem. But this is foreign to our Lord&#8217;s intention: for it must be understood as referring to the <i>general 			 judgment, </i>in which both must give their account, that there may be a comparison of the punishments. Christ mentioned <i>Sodom </i>rather than other cities, not only because it went beyond them all in flagitious crimes, but because God destroyed it in an extraordinary manner, that it might serve as an example to all ages, and that its very name might be held in abomination. And we need not 			 wonder if Christ declares that they will be treated less severely than those who refuse to hear the gospel. When men deny the authority of Him who made and formed them, when they refuse to listen to his voice, nay, reject disdainfully his gentle invitations, and withhold the confidence which is due to his gracious promises, such impiety is the utmost accumulation, as it were, of all crimes. But if the rejection of that obscure preaching was followed by such dreadful vengeance, how awful must be 			 the punishment that awaits those who reject Christ when he speaks openly! Again, if God punishes so severely the despisers of the word, what shall become of furious enemies who, by blasphemies and a venomous tongue, oppose the gospel, or cruelly persecute it by fire and sword?</p>
