 				  for they disfigure their faces, that it may be evident to men that they fast.

<p><a name="ix.lvi-p6"></A><a name="ix.lvi-p6.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lvi-p7"></A>He again returns to the former doctrine: for, having begun to rebuke vain ostentation in alms and prayer, he laid down, before proceeding farther, the rule for praying in a right manner. The same injunction is now given to his disciples about <i>fasting, </i>which he had 			 formerly given about <i>prayers</i> and <i>alms, </i>not to be too solicitous to obtain the applause of spectators, but to have God as the witness of their actions. When he bids them <i>anoint their head, and wash their 			 face, </i>his language is hyperbolical:   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_447"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">448</FONT></A>
 			  for Christ does not withdraw us from one kind of hypocrisy, to lead us into another.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_448"></A><A HREF="#fn_448"><FONT SIZE="1">449</FONT></A>
 			  He does not enjoin us to counterfeit splendor, or exhort us to temperance in food in such a manner, as to encourage the luxuries of ointments and of dress: but merely exhorts us to preserve moderation, without any thing new or affected;&#8212;in short, that the fastings, in which we engage, should make no change in our accustomed way of living.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lvi-p10"></A><i>Thy Father will reward thee</i>  When he promises a reward from God <i>to fastings, </i>this mode of expression, as we said a little before with respect to prayer, is not strictly accurate. There is a wide 			 difference, indeed, between <i>prayer</i> and <i>fastings</i>  Prayer holds the first rank among the antics of piety: but fasting is a doubtful operation, and does not, like <i>alms, </i>belong to the class of those actions which God requires and approves. It is pleasing to God, only so far as it is directed to another object: and that is, to train us to abstinence, to subdue the lust of the flesh, to excite us to earnestness in prayer, and to testify our repentance, when we are affected by the view of the tribunal of God. The meaning of Christ&#8217;s words is: &#8220;God will one day show that he was pleased with those good works, which appeared to be lost, because they were concealed from the eyes of men.&#8221;</p>
