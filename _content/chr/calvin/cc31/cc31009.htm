<p><a name="ix.i-p4"></A><a name="ix.i-p4.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p5"></A>Luke is the only Evangelist who makes a preface to his Gospel, for the purpose of explaining briefly the motive which induced him to write. By addressing a single individual he may appear to have acted foolishly, instead of sounding the trumpet aloud, as was his duty, and inviting all men to believe. It appears, therefore, to be unsuitable that the doctrine which does not peculiarly belong to one person or to another, but is common to all, 			 should be privately sent to his friend Theophilus. Hence some have been led to think that <i>Theophilus is </i>an appellative noun, and is applied to all godly persons on account of their <i>love of God; </i>but the epithet which is joined to it is inconsistent with that opinion. Nor is there any reason for dreading the absurdity which drove them to adopt such an expedient. For it is not less true that <i>Paul&#8217;s </i>doctrine belongs to all, though some of his Epistles were addressed to certain 			 cities, and others to certain men. Nay, we must acknowledge, if we take into account the state of those times, that Luke adopted a conscientious and prudent course. There were tyrants on every hand who, by terror and alarm, were prepared to obstruct the progress of sound doctrine. This gave occasion to Satan and his ministers for spreading abroad the clouds of error, by which the pure light would be obscured. Now, as the great body of men cared little about maintaining the purity of the Gospel, 			 and few considered attentively the inventions of Satan or the amount of danger that lurked under such disguises, every one who excelled others by uncommon faith, or by extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, was the more strongly bound to do his utmost, by care and industry, for preserving the doctrine of godliness pure and uncontaminated from every corruption. Such persons were chosen by God to be the sacred keepers of the law, by whom the heavenly doctrine committed to them should be honestly 			 handed down to posterity. With this view therefore, Luke dedicates his Gospel to Theophilus, that he might undertake the faithful preservation of it; and the same duty Paul enjoins and recommends to Timothy, (<a name="ix.i-p5.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#014">2 Tim. 1:14</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#014">2 Tim. 3:14</a><a name="ix.i-p5.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p6"></A><b>1. </b><i>Forasmuch as many.</i> He assigns a reason for writing which, one would think, ought rather to have dissuaded him from writing. To compose a history, which had already employed many authors, was unnecessary labor, at least if they had faithfully discharged their duty. But no accusation of imposture, or carelessness, or any other fault, is in 			 the slightest degree insinuated. It looks, therefore, as if he were expressing a resolution to do what had been already done. I reply, though he deals gently with those who had written before him, he does not altogether approve of their labors. He does not expressly say that they had written on matters with which they were imperfectly acquainted, but by laying claim to certainty as to the facts, he modestly denies their title to full and unshaken confidence. It may be objected that, if they 			 made false statements, they ought rather to have been severely censured. I reply again, they may not have been deeply in fault; they may have erred more from want of consideration than from malice; and, consequently, there would be no necessity for greater fierceness of attack. And certainly there is reason to believe that these were little more than historical sketches which, though comparatively harmless at the time, would afterwards, if they had not been promptly counteracted, have done 			 serious injury to the faith. But it is worthy of remark that, in applying this remedy through Luke to unnecessary writings, God had a wonderful design in view of obtaining, by universal consent, the rejection of others, and thus securing undivided credit to those which reflect brightly his adorable majesty. There is the less excuse for those silly people, by whom disgusting stories, under the name of Nicodemus, or some other person, are, at the present day, palmed upon the world.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p7"></A><i>Are most surely believed among us</i> The participle <a name="ix.i-p7.1"></A>&#960;&#949;&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#945;, which Luke employs, denotes things fully ascertained, and which do not admit of doubt. The old translator has repeatedly fallen into mistakes about this word, and through that 			 ignorance has given us a corrupted sense of some very beautiful passages. One of these occurs in the writings of Paul, where he enjoins every man to be fully persuaded in his own mind, (<a name="ix.i-p7.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#005">Ro 14:5</a><a name="ix.i-p7.2"></A>,) that conscience may not hesitate and waver, tossed to and fro (<a name="ix.i-p7.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014">Eph 4:14</a><a name="ix.i-p7.3"></A>) by doubtful opinions. Hence, too, is derived the word <a name="ix.i-p7.4"></A>&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#8055;&#945;<i>, </i>which he erroneously renders <i>fullness,</i> while it denotes that strong conviction springing from faith, in which godly minds safely rest. There is still, as I have said, an implied contrast; 			 for, by claiming for himself the authority of a faithful witness, he destroys the credit of others who give contrary statements.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p8"></A><i>Among us</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A>
 			  has the same meaning as <i>with us.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A>
 			  He appears to make faith rest on a weak foundation, its relation to men, while it ought to rest on the Word of God only; and certainly the <i>full assurance</i> <a name="ix.i-p10.2"></A>(&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#8055;&#945;) of faith is ascribed to the sealing of the Spirit, (<a name="ix.i-p10.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005">1Th 1:5</a><a name="ix.i-p10.3"></A>; <a name="ix.i-p10.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022">Heb 10:22</a><a name="ix.i-p10.4"></A>.) I reply, if the Word of God does not hold the first rank, faith will not be satisfied with any human testimonies, but, where the inward confirmation of the Spirit has already taken place, it allows them some weight in the historical knowledge of facts. By 			 historical knowledge I mean that knowledge which we obtain respecting events, either by our own observation or by the statement of others. For, with respect to the visible works of God, it is equally proper to listen to <i>eye-witnesses</i> as to rely on experience. Besides, those whom Luke follows were not private authors, but were also <i>ministers of the 			 Word</i> By this commendation he exalts them above the rank of human authority; for he intimates that the persons from whom he received his information had been divinely authorized to preach the Gospel. Hence, too, that security which he shortly afterwards mentions, and which, if it does not rest upon God, may soon be disturbed. There is great weight in his denominating those from whom he received his Gospel <i>ministers of the Word; </i>for on that ground believers conclude that the witnesses are beyond all exception, as the Lawyers express it, and cannot lawfully be set aside.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p11"></A>Erasmus, who has borrowed from Virgil   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A>
 			  a phrase used in his version, did not sufficiently consider the estimation and weight due to a Divine calling. Luke does not talk in a profane style, but enjoins us in the person of his friend Theophilus to keep in view the command of Christ, and to hear with reverence the Son of God speaking through his Apostles. It is a great matter that he affirms them to have been <i>eye-witneses, </i>but, by calling them <i>ministers, </i>he takes them out of the common order of men, that our faith may have its support in heaven and not in earth. In short, Luke&#8217;s meaning is this: &#8220;that, since thou now hast those things committed faithfully to writing which thou hadst formerly learned by oral 			 statements, thou mayest place a stronger reliance on the received doctrine.&#8221; It is thus evident that God has employed every method to prevent our faith from being suspended on the doubtful and shifting opinions of men. There is the less room for excusing the ingratitude of the world, which, as if it openly preferred the uncertainty arising out of vague and unfounded reports, turns from so great a Divine favor with loathing. But let us attend to the remarkable distinction which our Lord has laid 			 down, that foolish credulity may not insinuate itself under the name of faith. Meanwhile, let us allow the world to be allured, as it deserves, by the deceitful baits of foolish curiosity, and even to surrender itself willingly to the delusions of Satan.</p>

<p><a name="ix.i-p14"></A><b>3. </b><i>Having carefully examined all things</i> The old translator has it, <i>having followed out all things;</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A>
 			  and the Greek verb <a name="ix.i-p15.2"></A>&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#957; is taken metaphorically from those who tread in the footsteps of others, that nothing may escape them. So that Luke intended to express his close and laborious investigation, just as Demosthenes employs the same word, when, in examining an embassy against which he brings an accusation, he 			 boasts of his diligence to have been such, that he perceived every thing that had been done as well as if he had been a spectator.</p>
