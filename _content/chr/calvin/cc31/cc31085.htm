<p><a name="ix.lxxvii-p11"></A><b><a name="ix.lxxvii-p11.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018">Matthew 9:18</a><a name="ix.lxxvii-p11.2"></A>. </b><i>While he was speaking these things to them.</i> Those who imagine that the narrative, which is here given by Mark and Luke, is different from that of Matthew, are so clearly refuted by the passage itself, that there is no necessity for a lengthened debate. All the 			 three agree in saying that Christ was requested by <i>a ruler of the synagogue to enter his house </i>for the purpose of curing <i>his daughter</i>  The only difference is, that the name of <i>Jairus, </i>which is withheld by Matthew, is mentioned by Mark and Luke; and that he represents the father as saying, 			 <i>My daughter is dead, </i>while the other two say that she was in her last moments, and that, while he was bringing Christ, her death was announced to him on the road. But there is no absurdity in saying that Matthew, studying brevity, merely glances at those particulars which the other two give in minute detail. But since all the other points agree with such exactness, since so 			 many circumstances conspire as to give it the appearance of three fingers stretched out at the same time to point out a single object, there is no argument that would justify us in dividing this history into various dates. The Evangelists agree in relating, that while Christ, at the request of <i>a ruler of the synagogue, </i>was coming to his house, a woman on the road was secretly cured of <i>a bloody flux </i>by <i>touching his cloak; </i>and that afterwards Christ came into the ruler&#8217;s house, and raised a dead young woman to life. There is no necessity, I think, for circuitous language to prove that all the three relate the same event. Let us now come to details.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxvii-p12"></A><i>Lo, a certain ruler.</i> Though it is evident from the other two, that his confidence had not advanced so far as to hope that his daughter&#8217;s life could be restored, there is no room to doubt that, after having been reproved by Christ, he entertained a stronger hope than when he left his house. But Matthew, as we have said, studies 			 brevity, and puts down at the very beginning of his narrative what took place at various times. The manner in which the history must be arranged is this: <i>Jairus </i>first requested that his daughter might be cured of her disease, and afterwards that she might be restored from death to life; that is, after that Christ had given him courage to do so. <i>Worship, </i>or <i>adoration, 			 </i>is here put for k<i>neeling, </i>as is evident from the words of Mark and Luke: for Jairus did not render divine honor to Christ,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_526"></A><A HREF="#fn_526"><FONT SIZE="1">527</FONT></A>
 			  but treated him with respect as a prophet of God; and we all know how common a practice <i>kneeling </i>was among eastern nations.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxvii-p14"></A><i>Come and lay thy hand.</i> We have here a bright mirror in which the divine condescension towards us is beheld. If you compare the <i>ruler of the synagogue </i>with the centurion, who was a heathen, (<a name="ix.lxxvii-p14.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#005">Mt 8:5-10</a><a name="ix.lxxvii-p14.1"></A>,) you will say that the full brightness of faith shone in the centurion, while scarcely the smallest portion of it was visible in the <i>ruler</i>  He ascribes to Christ no power except through his touching the person; and, when he has received information of her death, he trembles as if there were no farther remedy. We see, then, that his 			 faith was feeble and nearly exhausted. Yet Christ yields to his prayers, and encourages him to expect a favorable result, and thus proves to us that his faith, however small it might be, was not wholly rejected. Though we have not such abundance of faith as might be desired, there is no reason why our weakness should drive away or discourage us from prayer.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxvii-p15"></A><a name="ix.lxxvii-p15.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxvii-p16"></A><b>20. </b><i>And, lo, a woman who had been afflicted with a bloody flux.</i> For <i>twelve successive years </i>the <i>bloody flux </i>had lasted, and the woman was so far from being negligent in seeking remedies, that 			 <i>she had spent all her substance on physicians</i>  All this is expressly stated by the Evangelists, that the miracle may shine with brighter glory. When an incurable disease was removed so suddenly, and by the mere touch of a garment, it is perfectly obvious that it was not accomplished by human power. The thought of the woman that, <i>if she only touched</i> Christ&#8217;s garment, she would immediately be cured, arose from an extraordinary impulse of the Holy Spirit, and ought not to be regarded as a general rule. We know how eagerly superstition is wont to sport in foolish and thoughtless attempts to copy the saints; but they are apes, and not imitators, who take up some remarkable example without the command of God, and are led 			 rather by their own senses than by the direction of the Spirit.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxvii-p17"></A>It is even possible that there was a mixture of sin and error in the woman&#8217;s <i>faith, </i>which Christ graciously bears and forgives. Certainly, when she afterwards thinks that she has done wrong, and <i>fears and trembles, </i>there is no apology for that kind of doubt: for it is opposed to faith. Why did she not rather go straight to Christ? If her reverence for him prevented, from what other source than from his mercy did she expect 			 aid? How comes it, then, that she is afraid of offending him, if she was convinced of his favorable regard?</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxvii-p18"></A>Yet Christ bestows high commendation on her faith. This agrees with what I have lately noticed, that God deals kindly and gently with his people, &#8212; accepts their faith, though imperfect and weak, &#8212; and does not lay to their charge the faults and imperfections with which it is connected. It was by the guidance of faith, therefore, that the woman approached to Christ. When she stopped at the garment, instead of presenting herself in prayers 			 that she might be cured, inconsiderate zeal may have drawn her a little aside from the right path; particularly as she soon afterwards shows that she had made the attempt with some degree of doubt and uncertainty. Were we even to grant that this was suggested to her by the Spirit, it still remains a fixed rule, that our faith must not be driven hither and thither by particular examples, but ought to rest wholly on the word of God, according to the saying of Paul, <i>Faith cometh by hearing, and 			 hearing by the word of God,</i> (<a name="ix.lxxvii-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017">Ro 10:17</a><a name="ix.lxxvii-p18.1"></A>.) This is a highly necessary warning, that we may not dignify with the name of faith any opinion which has been rashly embraced.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxvii-p19"></A><a name="ix.lxxvii-p19.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxvii-p20"></A><b><a name="ix.lxxvii-p20.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#045">Luke 8:45</a><a name="ix.lxxvii-p20.2"></A>.</b> <i>Who is it that touched me,</i> Mark expresses it still more clearly, when he says that Christ <i>looked around to see</i> who she was. 			 It does appear to be absurd that Christ should pour out his grace without knowing on whom he was bestowing a favor. There is not less difficulty in what he shortly afterwards says, that <i>he perceived that power had gone out from him:</i> as if, while it flowed from him, it was not a free gift bestowed at those times, and on those persons, whom he was pleased to select. Beyond all 			 question, he knowingly and willingly cured the woman; and there is as little doubt that he drew her to himself by his Spirit, that she might obtain a cure: but he puts the question to her, that she may freely and publicly make it known. If Christ had been the only witness of his miracle, his statements might not perhaps have been believed: but now, when the woman, struck with dread, relates what happened to her, greater weight is due to her confession.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxvii-p21"></A><a name="ix.lxxvii-p21.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxvii-p22"></A><b><a name="ix.lxxvii-p22.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#022">Matthew 9:22</a><a name="ix.lxxvii-p22.2"></A>.</b> <i>Take courage, my daughter.</i> This expression shows the weakness of her faith for, had there been no impropriety in her <i>trembling, </i>Christ would not have corrected it by exhorting her to 			 <i>take courage</i>  Yet, at the same time, he commends her <i>faith; </i>and this supports the view which I have already stated, that, while she sought Christ by the guidance of the Spirit, and from a sincere and pious desire, she hesitated in such a manner as to need to be strengthened. Thus we see that faith, in order to please God, needs forgiveness, and is 			 at the same time sustained by new aid, that it may acquire additional strength. We may here draw a comparison from the health of the body to that of the soul: for, as Christ says that the woman&#8217;s deliverance from her disease was the consequence of her <i>faith, </i>so it is certain, that we obtain by faith the forgiveness of sins, which reconciles us to God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxvii-p23"></A><a name="ix.lxxvii-p23.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxvii-p24"></A><b><a name="ix.lxxvii-p24.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#034">Mark 5:34</a><a name="ix.lxxvii-p24.2"></A>. </b><i>Go in peace, and be delivered from thy scourge.</i> From this exhortation we infer that the benefit which she had obtained was fully ratified, when she heard from the lips of Christ what she had already learned from experience: for we do not truly, or with a safe 			 conscience, enjoy God&#8217;s benefits in any other way than by possessing them as contained in the treasury of his promises.</p>
