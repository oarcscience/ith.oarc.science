<span id="ix.xxxvi-p1"></span>MATTHEW 4:13-16

<span id="ix.xxxvi-p2"></span><span id="ix.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>[Matthew
4:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013)<span
id="ix.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxxvi-p3"></span>**13**.** **And having left Nazareth, he
came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is a town on the sea-coast in the
borders of Zebulun and Naphtali, **14**.** **That it might be fulfilled,
which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, **15**.** **The land of
Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, near the way of the sea, beyond
Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles: **16**.** **The people who sat  <span
id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329) in darkness have seen a great light:
and to those who sat in the region and shadow of death light hath
arisen.

<span id="ix.xxxvi-p5"></span> 

<span id="ix.xxxvi-p6"></span><span id="ix.xxxvi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxxvi-p7"></span>**13.** *And having left Nazareth* I have
thought it proper to introduce this passage of Matthew, immediately
after Luke’s narrative, which we have just examined; because we may
gather from the context that, as Christ had hitherto been wont to
frequent the town of Nazareth, so, in order to avoid danger, he now bade
a final adieu to it, and dwelt in Capernaum and the neighboring towns.
There would be no difficulty in this history, were it not that there is
some appearance, as if Matthew had put a wrong meaning on the quotation
from the prophet. But if we attend to the true meaning of the prophet,
it will appear to be properly and naturally accommodated to the present
occasion. Isaiah, after having described a very heavy calamity of the
nation, soothes their grief by a promise that, when the nation shall be
reduced to extremity, a deliverance will immediately follow, which shall
dispel the darkness, and restore the light of life.

<span id="ix.xxxvi-p8"></span>The words are:

<span id="ix.xxxvi-p9"></span>“Nevertheless, the dimness shall not be
such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the
land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more
grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee
of the nations. The people that walked in darkness shall see a great
light” (<span id="ix.xxxvi-p9.1"></span>[Isa.
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002)<span id="ix.xxxvi-p9.1"></span>.)

<span id="ix.xxxvi-p10"></span>The Israelites had been twice visited by
a heavy calamity: first, when four tribes, or thereby, were carried away
into banishment, by Tiglath-Pileser, (<span
id="ix.xxxvi-p10.1"></span>[2Ki
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029)<span
id="ix.xxxvi-p10.1"></span>;) and, secondly, when Shalmaneser completed
the destruction of the kingdom of Israel, (<span
id="ix.xxxvi-p10.2"></span>[2Ki
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#009)<span
id="ix.xxxvi-p10.2"></span>.) There remained a third desolation, which —
the prophet had foretold towards the close of the eighth chapter — would
be the most dreadful of all. And now follows, in the words which we have
quoted, what is calculated to soothe their grief. God will stretch out
his hand to his people, and, therefore, death will be more tolerable
than the previous diseases were. *“*Though the whole nation,” says he,
“shall be destroyed, yet so brilliant shall be the light of grace, that
there will be less dimness in this last destruction than in the two
former instances, when the ten tribes were ruined.”

<span id="ix.xxxvi-p11"></span>The promise ought to be extended, I have
no doubt, to the whole body of the people, which might seem to be, to
all appearance, lost and destroyed. It is very absurd in the Jews to
confine it to the deliverance of the city of Jerusalem. as if the light
of life had been restored to it, when the siege was raised by the flight
of King Sennacherib,  <span id="fr_330"></span>[331](#fn_330) (<span
id="ix.xxxvi-p12.2"></span>[2Ki
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#036)<span
id="ix.xxxvi-p12.2"></span>.) Certainly, it is evident from the context,
that the prophet looks much farther; and, as he promises a universal
restoration of the whole church, it follows that *the land of Zebulun,
and the land of Naphtali, and Galilee of the Gentiles,* are included in
the number of those, to whom the darkness of death would be changed into
the light of life. The commencement of this light, and, as we might say,
the dawn, was the return of the people from Babylon. At length, Christ,
*“*the Sun of Righteousness,” (<span id="ix.xxxvi-p12.3"></span>[Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002)<span
id="ix.xxxvi-p12.3"></span>*,)* arose in full splendor, and, by his
coming, utterly *“abolished”* (<span id="ix.xxxvi-p12.4"></span>[2Ti
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010)<span id="ix.xxxvi-p12.4"></span>)
the darkness of death.

<span id="ix.xxxvi-p13"></span>In the same manner, Paul reminds us, that
it was a fulfillment of what occurs in many passages of the prophets,
*“*Awake*,* thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead,” (<span
id="ix.xxxvi-p13.1"></span>[Eph
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014)<span
id="ix.xxxvi-p13.1"></span>.) Now, we know that the kingdom of Christ is
spiritual, and, therefore, the light of salvation which it brings, and
all the assistance which we derive from it, must correspond to its
nature. Hence it follows, that our souls are plunged in the darkness of
everlasting death, till he enlightens them by his grace. The prophet’s
discourse relates, no doubt, to the destruction of the nation, but
presents to us, as in a mirror, what is the condition of mankind, until
they are delivered by the grace of Christ. When *those, who lay in
darkness,* are said to *have seen a great light,* a change so sudden and
remarkable is intended to enlarge our views of the greatness of the
divine salvation. Lower Galilee is called *Galilee of the Gentiles,* not
only on account of its vicinity to Tyre and Sidon, but because its
inhabitants were a mixture of Jews and Gentiles, particularly after that
David had granted some cities to King Hiram.  <span

cities in the land of Galilee.”* — *Ed.*
