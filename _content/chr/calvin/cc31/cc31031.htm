<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p7"></A><a name="ix.xxiii-p7.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p8"></A><b>13.</b> <i>And when they had departed</i> How many days elapsed from the departure of the Magi, till Joseph was ordered to flee into Egypt, is not known, nor is it of much importance to inquire: only it is probable that the Lord spared Mary, till she was so far recovered from childbirth as to 			 be able to perform the journey. It was a wonderful purpose of God, that he chose to preserve his Son by flight. The mind of Joseph must have been harassed by dangerous temptations, when he came to see that there was no hope but in flight: for in flight there was no appearance of divine protection. Besides, it was very difficult to reconcile the statement, that he who was to be the Savior of all, could not be preserved without the exertion of a mortal man. But, in preserving the life of his Son, 			 God maintained such reserve, as to give some indications of his heavenly power, and yet not to make it so manifest as to prevent it from being concealed under the appearance of weakness: for the full time of glorifying Christ openly was not yet come. The angel predicts an event which was hidden, and unknown to men. That is an evident proof of divine guidance. But the angel orders him to defend the life of the child by flight and exile. This belongs to the weakness of flesh, to which Christ was 			 subjected.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p9"></A>We are here taught, that God has more than one way of preserving his own people. Sometimes he makes astonishing displays of his power; while at other times he employs dark coverings or shadows, from which feeble rays of it escape. This wonderful method of preserving the Son of God under the cross teaches us, that they act improperly who prescribe to God a fixed plan of action. Let us permit him to advance our salvation by a diversity of 			 methods; and let us not refuse to be humbled, that he may more abundantly display his glory. Above all, let us never avoid the cross, by which the Son of God himself was trained from his earliest infancy. This flight is a part of the foolishness of the cross, but it surpasses all the wisdom of the world. That he may appear at his own time as the Savior of Judea, he is compelled to flee from it, and is nourished by Egypt, from which nothing but what was destructive to the Church of God had ever 			 proceeded. Who would not have regarded with amazement such an unexpected work of God?</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p10"></A>Joseph immediately complies with the injunction of the Angel. This is another proof of the certainty of the dream: for such promptitude of obedience plainly shows, that he had no doubt whatever, that it was God who had enjoined him to take flight. This eager haste may wear somewhat of the aspect of distrust: for the flight <i>by night 			 </i>had some appearance of alarm. But it is not difficult to frame an excuse. He saw that God had appointed a method of safety which was low and mean: and he concludes that he is at liberty to take flight in such a state of alarm as is commonly produced by extreme danger. Our fear ought always to be regulated by the divine intimations. If it agrees with them, it will not be opposed to faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p11"></A><i>Be thou there until I have told thee</i> By these words the Angel declares, that the life of the child will, even in future, be the object of the divine care. Joseph needed to be thus strengthened, so as to conclude with certainty, that God would not only conduct him in the journey, but that, during his banishment, God would be his 			 constant protector. And in this way God was pleased to allay many anxieties, with which the heart of the good man must have been perplexed, so that he enjoyed serenity of mind during his sojourn in Egypt. But for this, not a moment would have passed without numerous temptations, when he saw himself excluded not only from the inheritance promised by God to all his saints, &#8212; but from the temple, from sacrifices, from a public profession of his faiths, &#8212; and was living among the worst enemies of 			 God, and in a deep gulf of superstitions. He carried with him, indeed, in the person of the child, all the blessings which the Fathers had hoped to enjoy, or which the Lord had promised to them: but as he had not yet made such proficiency in faith, and in the knowledge of Christ, he needed to be restrained by this injunction, <i>Be thou there until I have told thee, </i>that he might 			 not be displeased at languishing in banishment from his country among the Egyptians.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p12"></A><a name="ix.xxiii-p12.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p13"></A><b>15.</b> <i>Out of Egypt have I called my Son</i> Matthew says that a prediction was fulfilled. Some have thought, that the intention of the prophet was different from what is here stated, and have supposed the meaning to be, that the Jews act foolishly in opposing and endeavoring to oppress 			 the Son of God, because the Father <i>hath called him out of Egypt</i> In this way, they grievously pervert the words of the prophet, (<a name="ix.xxiii-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001">Ho 11:1</a><a name="ix.xxiii-p13.1"></A>,) the design of which is, to establish a charge of ingratitude against the Jews, who, from their earliest infancy, and from the 			 commencement of their history, had found God to be a kind and generous Father, and yet were provoking him by fresh offenses. Beyond all question, the passage ought not to be restricted to the person of Christ: and yet it is not tortured by Matthew, but skilfully applied to the matter in hand.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p14"></A>The words of the prophet ought to be thus interpreted: &#8220;When Israel was yet a child, I brought him out of that wretched bondage in which he had been plunged. He was formerly like a dead man, and Egypt served him for a grave; but I drew him out of it as from the womb, and brought him into the light of life.&#8221; And justly does the Lord speak in this manner; for that deliverance was a sort of birth of the nation. Then were openly produced 			 letters of adoption, when, by the promulgation of the law, they became &#8220;the Lord&#8217;s portion,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xxiii-p14.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009">De 32:9</a><a name="ix.xxiii-p14.1"></A>,) &#8220;a royal priesthood, and a holy nation,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xxiii-p14.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009">1Pe 2:9</a><a name="ix.xxiii-p14.2"></A>;) when they were separated from the other nations, and when, in short, God &#8220;set up his tabernacle&#8221; (<a name="ix.xxiii-p14.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#011">Le 26:11</a><a name="ix.xxiii-p14.3"></A>) to dwell in the midst of them. The words of the prophet import, that the nation was rescued from Egypt as from a deep whirlpool of death. Now, what was the redemption brought by Christ, but a resurrection from the dead, and the commencement of a new life? The light of salvation had been almost extinguished, when God begat the Church anew in the person of Christ. Then did the Church come out of Egypt in its head, as 			 the whole body had been formerly brought out.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p15"></A>This analogy prevents us from thinking it strange, that any part of Christ&#8217;s childhood was passed in Egypt. The grace and power of God became more illustrious, and his wonderful purpose was more distinctly seen, when light came out of darkness, and life out of hell. Otherwise, the sense of the flesh might have broken out here in contemptuous language, <i>&#8220;</i>Truly a Redeemer is to come out of Egypt!&#8221;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">210</FONT></A>
 			 Matthew therefore reminds us, that it is no strange or unwonted occurrence for God to call his Son out of that country; and that it serves rather to confirm our faith, that, as on a former occasion, so now again, the Church of God comes out of Egypt. There is this difference, however, between the two cases. The whole nation was formerly shut up in the prison of Egypt; while, in the second redemption, it was Christ, the head of the Church alone, who was concealed there, but who carried 			 the salvation and life of all shut up in his own person.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p17"></A><a name="ix.xxiii-p17.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p18"></A><b>16.</b> <i>Then Herod when he saw</i> Matthew speaks according to what Herod felt and thought about the matter. He believed that the Magi had deceived him, because they did not choose to take part in his wicked cruelty. He was rather taken in his own trickery, &#8212; in his base pretense, that he 			 too intended to pay homage to the new King.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p19"></A>Josephus makes no mention of this history. The only writer who mentions it is Macrobius, in the Second Book of his <i>Saturnalia, </i>where, relating the jokes and taunts of Augustus, he says: <i>When he heard that, by Herod&#8217;s command, the children in Syria under two years of age had been slain, and that his own son had been slain among the crowd, &#8220;I would rather,&#8221; said he, &#8220;have been Herod&#8217;s hog than his son.&#8221;</i> But the authority 			 of Matthew alone is abundantly sufficient for us. Josephus certainly ought not to have passed over a crime so worthy of being put on record. But there is the less reason to wonder that he says nothing about the infants; for he passes lightly over, and expresses in obscure language, an instance of Herod&#8217;s cruelty not less shocking, which took place about the same time, when he put to death all the Judges, who were called the Sanhedrim, that hardly a remnant might remain of the stock of David. It 			 was the same dread, I have no doubt, that impelled him to both of these murders.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p20"></A>There is some uncertainty about the date.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">211</FONT></A>
 			  Matthew says, that they were slain <i>from two years old and under, according to the time which he had inquired at the Magi: </i>from which we may infer that Christ had then reached that age, or at least was not far from being two years old. Some go farther, and conclude that Christ was about that age at the time when the Magi came. But I contend that the 			 one does not follow from the other. With what terror Herod was seized when the report was widely spread about a new king who had been borne,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">212</FONT></A>
 			  we have lately seen. Fear prevented him at that time from employing a traitor, in a secret manner, to make an investigation.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">213</FONT></A>
 			  There is no reason to wonder that he was restrained, for some time, from the commission of a butchery so hateful and shocking, particularly while the report about the arrival of the Magi was still <i>recent. </i>It is certainly probable, that he revolved the crime in his mind, but delayed it till a convenient opportunity should occur. It is even possible, that he first murdered the Judges, in order to deprive the people of 			 their leaders, and thus to compel them to look upon the crime as one for which there was no remedy.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">214</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p25"></A>We may now conclude it to be a frivolous argument, on which those persons rest, who argue, that Christ was two years old when he was worshipped by the Magi, because, <i>according to the time when the star appeared, </i>Herod slew the children who were a little below two years old. Such persons take for granted, 			 without any proper ground, that the star did not appear till after that the Virgin had brought forth her child. It is far more probable, that they had been warned early, and that they undertook the journey close upon the time of the birth of Christ, that they might see the child when lately born, in the cradle, or in his mother&#8217;s lap. It is a very childish imagination that, because they came from an unknown country, and almost from another world, they had spent about two years on the road. The 			 conjectures stated by Osiander   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">215</FONT></A>
 			  are too absurd to need refutation.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p27"></A>But there is no inconsistency in the thread of the story which I propose, &#8212; that the Magi came when the period of child-bearing was not yet over, and inquired after <i>a king who had been born, </i>not after one who was already two years old; that, after they had returned to their own country, Joseph fled by 			 night, but still in passing discharged a pious duty at Jerusalem, (for in so populous a city, where there was a constant influx of strangers from every quarter, he might be secure from danger;) that, after he had departed to Egypt, Herod began to think seriously about his own danger, and the ulcer of revenge, which he had nourished in his heart for more than a year and half, at length broke out. The adverb <i>then </i>(<a name="ix.xxiii-p27.1"></A>&#964;&#8057;&#964;&#949;) does not always denote in Scripture uninterrupted time,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_215"></A><A HREF="#fn_215"><FONT SIZE="1">216</FONT></A>
 			  but frequently occurs, when there is a great distance between the events.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p29"></A><a name="ix.xxiii-p29.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p30"></A><b>18.</b> A <i>voice was heard in Ramah</i> It is certain that the prophet describes (<a name="ix.xxiii-p30.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#015">Jer 31:15</a><a name="ix.xxiii-p30.1"></A>) the destruction of the tribe of Benjamin, which took place in his time: for he 			 had foretold that the tribe of Judah would be cut off, to which was added the half of the tribe of Benjamin. He puts the mourning into the mouth of Rachel, who had been long dead. This is a <i>personification, (</i><a name="ix.xxiii-p30.2"></A>&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#953;&#776;&#945;<i>,) </i>which has a powerful influence in moving the affections. It was not for the mere purpose of 			 ornamenting his style, that Jeremiah employed rhetorical embellishments. There was no other way of correcting the hardness and stupidity of the living, than by arousing the dead, as it were, from their graves, to bewail those divine chastisements, which were commonly treated with derision. The prediction of Jeremiah having been accomplished at that time, Matthew does not mean that it foretold what Herod would do, but that the coming of Christ occasioned a renewal of that mourning, which had 			 been experienced, many centuries before, by the tribe of Benjamin.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p31"></A>He intended thus to meet a prejudice which might disturb and shake pious minds. It might be supposed, that no salvation could be expected from him, on whose account, as soon as he was born, infants were murdered; nay more, that it was an unfavorable and disastrous omen, that the birth of Christ kindled a stronger flame of cruelty than usually burns amidst the most inveterate wars. But as Jeremiah promises a restoration, where a nation has 			 been cut off, down to their little children, so Matthew reminds his readers, that this massacre would not prevent Christ from appearing shortly afterwards as the Redeemer of the whole nation: for we know that the whole chapter in Jeremiah, in which those words occur, is filled with the most delightful consolations. Immediately after the mournful complaint, he adds,</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.xxiii-p32"></A>&#8220;Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord, and they shall come again from the land of the enemy. And there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come again to thine own border,&#8221; (<a name="ix.xxiii-p32.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#016">Jer. 31:16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#017">17</a><a name="ix.xxiii-p32.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.xxiii-p33"></A>Such was the resemblance between the former calamity which the tribe of Benjamin had sustained, and the second calamity, which is here recorded. Both were a prelude of the salvation which was shortly to arrive.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">217</FONT></A>
