<p><a name="ix.liv-p8"></A>It is uncertain whether this form was once only or twice delivered by Christ to his disciples.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_428"></A><A HREF="#fn_428"><FONT SIZE="1">429</FONT></A>
 			 Some think that the latter is more probable; because Luke says that he was requested to do it, while Matthew represents him as teaching it of his own accord. But as we have said, that Matthew collects all the leading points of doctrine, in order that the whole amount of them may be more clearly perceived by the readers when they are placed in close succession, it is possible that Matthew may have omitted to mention the occasion which is related by Luke. On this subject, however, I am 			 unwilling to debate with any person.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p10"></A><b><a name="ix.liv-p10.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001">Luke 11:1</a><a name="ix.liv-p10.1"></A></b>  <i>As John also taught his diciples.</i> John delivered to his disciples a particular form of prayer; and he did so, in my opinion, because the time required it. The state of affairs among the Jews was, at that time, exceedingly corrupted. Every thing 			 connected with religion had so miserably fallen, that we need not be surprised to find few among them, by whom prayer was offered in a proper manner.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_429"></A><A HREF="#fn_429"><FONT SIZE="1">430</FONT></A>
 			  Besides, it was proper, that the minds of believers should be excited, by prayer, to hope and desire the promised redemption, which was at hand. John might, therefore, have collected, out of various passages of Scripture, a certain prayer adapted to the time, and approaching more nearly to the spiritual kingdom of Christ, which had already begun to be revealed.</p>

<p><a name="ix.liv-p13"></A><b><a name="ix.liv-p13.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009">Matthew 6:9</a><a name="ix.liv-p13.2"></A></b> <i>Do ye therefore pray thus</i> Instead of this Luke says, <i>when ye pray, say</i>: though Christ does not enjoin his 			 people to pray in a prepared form of words,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_430"></A><A HREF="#fn_430"><FONT SIZE="1">431</FONT></A>
 			  but only points out what ought to be the object of all our wishes and prayers. He embraces, therefore, in six petitions what we are at liberty to ask from God. Nothing is more advantageous to us than such instruction. Though this is the most important exercise of piety, yet in forming our prayers, and regulating our wishes, all our senses fail us. No man will pray aright, unless his lips and heart shall be directed by the Heavenly Master. For that purpose he has 			 laid down this rule, by which we must frame our prayers, if we desire to have them accounted lawful and approved by God. It was not the intention of the Son of God, (as we have already said), to prescribe the words which we must use, so as not to leave us at liberty to depart from the form which he has dictated. His intention rather was, to guide and restrain our wishes, that they might not go beyond those limits and hence we infer, that the rule which he has given us for praying aright relates 			 not to the words, but to the things themselves.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p15"></A>This form of prayer consists, as I have said, of six petitions. The first three, it ought to be known, relate to the glory of God, without any regard to ourselves; and the remaining three relate to those things which are necessary for our salvation. As the law of God is divided into two tables, of which the former contains the duties of piety, and the latter the duties of charity,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_431"></A><A HREF="#fn_431"><FONT SIZE="1">432</FONT></A>
 			 so in prayer Christ enjoins us to consider and seek the glory of God, and, at the same time, permits us to consult our own interests. Let us therefore know, that we shall be in a state of mind for praying in a right manner, if we not only are in earnest about ourselves and our own advantage, but assign the first place to the glory of God: for it would be altogether preposterous to mind only what belongs to ourselves, and to disregard the kingdom of God, which is of far greater 			 importance.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p17"></A><i>Our Father who art in heaven</i> Whenever we engage in prayer, there are two things to be considered, both that we may have access to God, and that we may rely on Him with full and unshaken confidence: his fatherly love toward us, and his boundless power. Let us therefore entertain no doubt, that God is willing to receive us graciously, 			 that he is ready to listen to our prayers, &#8212; in a word, that of Himself he is disposed to aid us. <i>Father</i> is the appellation given to him; and under this title Christ supplies us with sufficiently copious materials for confidence. But as it is only the half of our reliance that is founded on the goodness of God, in the next clause, <i>who art in heaven, </i>he gives us a lofty idea of the power of God. When the Scripture says, that God is <i>in heaven, </i>the meaning is, that all things are subject to his dominions, &#8212; that the world, and everything in it, is held by his hand, &#8212; that his power is everywhere diffused, &#8212; that all things are arranged by his providence. David says, &#8220;He that dwelleth in the heavens 			 shall laugh at them,&#8221; (<a name="ix.liv-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004">Ps 2:4</a><a name="ix.liv-p17.1"></A>); and again, &#8220;Our God is in heaven: he hath done whatever he hath pleased,&#8221; (<a name="ix.liv-p17.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003">Ps 115:3</a><a name="ix.liv-p17.2"></A>).</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p18"></A>When God is said to be <i>in heaven, </i>we must not suppose that he dwells only there; but, on the contrary, must hold what is said in another passage, that &#8220;the heavens of heavens do not contain him,&#8221; (<a name="ix.liv-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#006">2Ch 2:6</a><a name="ix.liv-p18.1"></A>). This mode of expression separates him from the rank of creatures, and reminds us that, when we think of him, we ought not to form any low or earthly conceptions: for he is higher than the whole world. We have now ascertained the design of Christ. In the commencement of the prayer, he desired his own people to rest their confidence on the goodness and power of God; because, unless our prayers are founded on faith, they will be of no advantage. Now, as it would 			 be the folly and madness of presumption, to call God our Father, <i>except</i> on the ground that, through our union to the body of Christ, we are acknowledged as his children, we conclude, that there is no other way of praying aright, but by approaching God with reliance on the Mediator.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p19"></A><i>May thy name be sanctified</i> This makes still more manifest what I have said, that in the first three petitions we ought to lose sight of ourselves, and seek the glory of God: not that it is separated from our salvation, but that the majesty of God ought to be greatly preferred by us to every other object of solicitude. It is of 			 unspeakable advantage to us that God reigns, and that he receives the honor which is due to him: but no man has a sufficiently earnest desire to promote the glory of God, unless (so to speak) he forgets himself, and raises his mind to seek God&#8217;s exalted greatness. There is a close connection and resemblance between those three petitions. <i>The sanctification of the name of God </i>is always connected with his <i>kingdom; 			 </i>and the most important part of his <i>kingdom </i>lies in <i>his will being done. </i>Whoever considers how cold and negligent we are in desiring the greatest of those blessings for which we are here commanded to pray, will acknowledge that nothing here is superfluous, but that it is proper that the three petitions should be thus distinguished.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p20"></A>To <i>sanctify the name of God</i> means nothing else, than to <i>give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name, </i>so that men may never think or speak of him but with the deepest veneration. The opposite of 			 this is the <i>profanation</i> of the name of God, which takes place, when men either speak disrespectfully of the divine majesty, or at least without that reverence which they ought to feel. Now, the glory, by which it is <i>sanctified, </i>flows and results from the acknowledgments made by men as to the wisdom, goodness, righteousness, power, and all the other attributes of God. For 			 holiness always dwells, and permanently remains, in God: but men obscure it by their malice and depravity, or dishonor and pollute it by sacrilegious contempt. The substance of this petition is, that the glory of God may shine in the world, and may be duly acknowledged by men. But religion is in its highest purity and rigour, when men believe, that whatever proceeds from God is right and proper, full of righteousness and wisdom: for the consequence is, that they embrace his word with the 			 obedience of faith, and approve of all his ordinances and works. That faith which we yield to the word of God is, so to speak, our subscription,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_432"></A><A HREF="#fn_432"><FONT SIZE="1">433</FONT></A>
 			  by which we <i>&#8220;</i>set to our seal that God is faithful,&#8221; (<a name="ix.liv-p21.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033">Joh 3:33</a><a name="ix.liv-p21.2"></A>;) as the highest dishonor that can be done to him is unbelief and contempt of his word.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p22"></A>We now see, what wickedness is displayed by most men in judging of the works of God, and how freely they allow themselves to indulge in censure. If any of us are chastised, they grumble, and murmur, and complain, and some break out into open blasphemies: if he does not grant our wishes, we think that he is not sufficiently kind to us.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_433"></A><A HREF="#fn_433"><FONT SIZE="1">434</FONT></A>
 			 Many turn into matter of idle talk and jesting his incomprehensible providence and secret judgments. Even his holy and sacred name is often treated with the grossest mockery. In short, a part of the world profane his holiness to the utmost of their power. We need not then wonder, if we are commanded to ask, in the first place, that the reverence which is due to it may be given by the world. Besides, this is no small honor done to us, when God recommends to us the advancement of his 			 glory.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p24"></A><a name="ix.liv-p24.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p25"></A><b>10. </b><i>May thy kingdom come</i> Though the Greek verb (<a name="ix.liv-p25.2"></A>&#7952;&#955;&#952;&#8051;&#964;&#969;) is simple, yet if, instead of <i>May thy kingdom come, </i>we read, as it was rendered 			 in the old translation, <i>May thy kingdom arrive,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_434"></A><A HREF="#fn_434"><FONT SIZE="1">435</FONT></A>
 			  the meaning will remain unchanged. We must first attend to the definition of the <i>kingdom </i>of God. He is said to <i>reign </i>among men, when they voluntarily devote and submit themselves to be governed by him, placing their flesh under the yoke, and renouncing their desires. Such is the corruption of the nature, that all our affections are so many 			 soldiers of Satan, who oppose the justice of God, and consequently obstruct or disturb his <i>reign. </i>By this prayer we ask, that he may remove all hindrances, and may bring all men under his dominion, and may lead them to meditate on the heavenly life.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p27"></A>This is done partly by the preaching of the word, and partly by the secret power of the Spirit. It is his will to govern men by his word: but as the bare voice, if the inward power of the Spirit be not added, does not pierce the hearts of men, both must be joined together, in order that the <i>kingdom </i>of God may be established. We therefore pray that God would exert his power, 			 both by the Word and by the Spirit, that the whole world may willingly submit to him. The <i>kingdom </i>of God is opposed to all disorder (<a name="ix.liv-p27.1"></A>&#7936;&#964;&#945;&#958;&#8055;&#945;) and confusion for good order is nowhere found in the world, except when he regulates by his hand the schemes and dispositions of men. Hence we conclude, that the commencement of the <i>reign </i>of God in us is the destruction of the old man, and the denial of ourselves, that we may be renewed to another life.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p28"></A>There is still another way in which God reigns; and that is, when he overthrows his enemies, and compels them, with Satan their head, to yield a reluctant subjection to his authority, &#8220;till they all be made his footstools&#8221; (<a name="ix.liv-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#013">Heb 10:13</a><a name="ix.liv-p28.1"></A>.) The substance of this prayer is, that God would enlighten the world by the light of his Word, &#8212; would form the hearts 			 of men, by the influences of his Spirit, to obey his justice, and would restore to order, by the gracious exercise of his power, all the disorder that exists in the world. Now, he commences his reign by subduing the desires of our flesh. Again, as the <i>kingdom </i>of God is continually growing and advancing to the end of the world, we must pray every day that it <i>may come: </i>for to whatever extent iniquity abounds in the world, to such an extent <i>the kingdom of God, </i>which brings 			 along with it perfect righteousness, is not yet <i>come.</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p29"></A><i>May thy will be done</i> Although the <i>will </i>of God, viewed in itself, is one and simple, it is presented to us in Scripture under a twofold aspect.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_435"></A><A HREF="#fn_435"><FONT SIZE="1">436</FONT></A>
 			  It is said, that the will of God is done, when he executes the secret counsels of his providence, however obstinately men may strive to oppose him. But here we are commanded to pray that, in another sense, <i>his will may be done,</i> &#8212; that all creatures may obey him, without opposition, and without reluctance. This appears more clearly from the comparison, <i>as in 			 heaven</i>  For, as He has the angels constantly ready to execute his commands, (and hence they are said to <i>do his commandments, hearkening to the voice of his word,</i> <a name="ix.liv-p30.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020">Ps 103:20</a><a name="ix.liv-p30.2"></A>,) so we desire that all men may have their will formed to such harmony with 			 the righteousness of God, that they may freely bend in whatever direction he shall appoint. It is, no doubt, a holy desire, when we bow to the <i>will </i>of God, and acquiesce in his appointments. But this prayer implies something more. It is a prayer, that God may remove all the obstinacy of men, which rises in unceasing rebellion against him, and may render them gentle and submissive, that they may not wish or desire any thing but what pleases him, 			 and meets his approbation.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p31"></A>But it may be objected: Ought we to ask from God what, he declares, will never exist to the end of the world? I reply: When we pray that the earth may become obedient to the will of God, it is not necessary that we should look particularly at every individual. It is enough for us to declare, by such a prayer as this, that we hate and regret whatever we perceive to be contrary to the will of God, and long for its utter destruction, not only 			 that it may be the rule of all our affections, but that we may yield ourselves without reserve, and with all cheerfulness, to its fulfillment.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p32"></A><a name="ix.liv-p32.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p33"></A><b>11. </b><i>Give us today our daily bread</i>  Of the form of prayer which Christ has prescribed to us this may be called, as I have said, the Second Table. I have adopted this mode of dividing it for the sake of instruction.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_436"></A><A HREF="#fn_436"><FONT SIZE="1">437</FONT></A>
 			  The precepts which relate to the proper manner of worshipping God are contained in the First Table of the law, and those which relate to the duties of charity in the Second. Again, in this prayer, &#8212; &#8220;I have formerly divided it thus, in order to instruct more familiarly.&#8221; our Lord first instructs us to seek the glory of God, and then points out, in the second part, what we ought to ask for ourselves. But it must be observed, that the prayers which we offer for our 			 salvation, or for our own advantage, ought to have this for their ultimate object: for we must not be so exclusively occupied with what is advantageous to ourselves, as to omit, in any instance, to give the first place to the glory of God. When we pray, therefore, we must never turn away our eyes from that object.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p35"></A>There is this difference, however, between the two kinds of petitions which we have mentioned. When we pray for <i>the kingdom of God</i> and the <i>sanctification of his name, </i>our eyes ought to be directed 			 upwards, so as to lose sight of ourselves, and to be fixed on God alone. We then come down to ourselves, and connect with those former petitions, which look to God alone, solicitude about our own salvation. Though the <i>forgiveness of sins</i> is to be preferred to food,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_437"></A><A HREF="#fn_437"><FONT SIZE="1">438</FONT></A>
 			  as far as the soul is more valuable than the body, yet our Lord commenced with <i>bread</i> and the supports of an earthly life, that from such a beginning he might carry us higher. We do not ask that our daily bread may be given to us before we ask that we may be reconciled to God, as if the perishing food of the belly were to be considered more valuable 			 than the eternal salvation of the soul: but we do so that we may ascend, as it were by steps, from earth to heaven. Since God condescends to nourish our bodies, there can be no doubt whatever, that he is far more careful of our spiritual life. This kind and gentle manner of treating us raises our confidence higher.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p37"></A>Some are of opinion, that <a name="ix.liv-p37.1"></A>&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7940;&#950;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957; means <i>our supersubstantial bread</i>  This is exceedingly absurd. The reason assigned by Erasmus is not only frivolous, but 			 inconsistent with piety. He reckons it improbable that, when we come into the presence of God, Christ should enjoin us to make mention of food. As if this manner of instruction were not to be found in every part of Scripture, to lead us to the expectation of heavenly blessings, by giving us a taste of temporal blessings. It is indeed the true proof of our faith, when we ask nothing but from God, and not only acknowledge him to be the only fountain of all blessings, but feel that his fatherly 			 kindness extends to the smallest matters, so that he does not disdain to take care even of our flesh.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p38"></A>That Christ speaks here of bodily food may easily be inferred: first, because otherwise the prayer would be defective and incomplete. We are enjoined, in many passages, to throw all our cares into the bosom of God, and he graciously promises, that <i>&#8220;</i>he will withhold from us no good thing,&#8221; (<a name="ix.liv-p38.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011">Ps 84:11</a><a name="ix.liv-p38.1"></A>.) In a perfect rule of prayer, therefore, some direction must be laid down as to the innumerable wants of the present life. Besides, the word <a name="ix.liv-p38.2"></A>&#963;&#8053;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;<i>, today, </i>means that we are to ask from God no more than is necessary for the day:   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_438"></A><A HREF="#fn_438"><FONT SIZE="1">439</FONT></A>
 			  for there is no doubt, that he intended to restrain and guide our desire of earthly food, to which we are all immoderately addicted. Again, a very frequent Synecdoche occurs in the word <i>bread, </i>under which the Hebrews include every description of food. But here it has a still more extensive meaning: for we ask not only that the hand of God may supply us 			 with food, but that we may receive all that is necessary for the present life.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p40"></A>The meaning is now obvious. We are first commanded to pray, that God would protect and cherish the life which he has given to us in the world, and, as we need many supports, that he would supply us with every thing that he knows to be needful. Now, as the kindness of God flows in uninterrupted succession to feed us, the bread which he bestows is called <a name="ix.liv-p40.1"></A>&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;, that is, continual:   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_439"></A><A HREF="#fn_439"><FONT SIZE="1">440</FONT></A>
 			  for so it may be rendered. This word suggests to us such a petition as the following: &#8220;O Lord, since our life needs every day new supplies, may it please thee to grant them to us without interruption.&#8221; The adverb <i>today, </i>as I said a little ago, is added to restrain our excessive desire, and to teach us, that we depend <i>every </i>moment on the kindness of God, and ought to 			 be content with that portion which he gives us, to use a common expression, &#8220;from day to day.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p42"></A>But here an objection may be urged. It is certain, that Christ has given a rule for prayer, which belongs equally to all the godly. Now, some of their number are rich men, who have their yearly produce laid up in store. Why does he command them to ask what they have at home, and to ask every day those things of which they have an abundant supply for a year? The reply is easy. These words remind us that, unless God feed us daily, the largest 			 accumulation of the necessaries of life will be of no avail. Though we may have abundance of corn, and wine, and every thing else, unless they are watered by the secret blessing of God, they will suddenly vanish, or we will be deprived of the use of them, or they will lose their natural power to support us, so that we shall famish in the midst of plenty. There is therefore no reason to wonder, if Christ invites the rich and poor indiscriminately to apply to their Heavenly Father for the supply 			 of their wants. No man will sincerely offer such a prayer as this, unless he has learned, by the example of the Apostle Paul, &#8220;to be full and to be hungry, to abound and to suffer need,&#8221; (<a name="ix.liv-p42.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012">Php 4:12</a><a name="ix.liv-p42.1"></A>,) to endure patiently his poverty or his humble condition, and not to be intoxicated by a false confidence in his abundance.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p43"></A>Does any one inquire, why we ask that bread to be given to us, which we call <i>OUR bread? </i>I answer: It is so called, not because it belongs to us by right, but because the fatherly kindness of God has set it apart for our use. It becomes <i>ours, </i>because our Heavenly Father freely bestows it on us for the supply of our necessities. The fields must, no doubt, be cultivated, labor must be bestowed on gathering the fruits of the earth, and every man must submit to the toil of his calling, in order to procure food. But all this does not hinder us from being fed by the undeserved kindness of God, without which men might waste their strength to no purpose. We are thus taught, that what we seem to have acquired by our own industry 			 is his gift. We may likewise infer from this word, that, if we wish God to feed us, we must not take what belongs to others: for all who have been <i>taught of God,</i> (<a name="ix.liv-p43.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045">Joh 6:45</a><a name="ix.liv-p43.1"></A>,) whenever they employ this form of prayer, make a declaration that they desire nothing but what is their own.</p>

<p><a name="ix.liv-p45"></A><b>12. </b><i>And forgive us our debts</i>  Here it may be proper that we should be reminded of what I said a little before, that Christ, in arranging the prayers of his people, did not consider which was first or second in order. It is written, that our prayers are as it were a wall which hinders 			 our approach to God, (<a name="ix.liv-p45.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#002">Isa 59:2</a><a name="ix.liv-p45.1"></A>,) or a cloud which prevents him from beholding us, (<a name="ix.liv-p45.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#022">Isa 44:22</a><a name="ix.liv-p45.2"></A>,) and that</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.liv-p46"></A>&#8220;he hath covered himself with a cloud, that our <br> 			 prayer should not pass through,&#8221; (<a name="ix.liv-p46.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#044">La 3:44</a><a name="ix.liv-p46.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p47"></A>We ought always, therefore, to begin with the forgiveness of sins: for the first hope of being heard by God beams upon us, when we obtain his favor; and there is no way in which he is <i>&#8220;</i>pacified toward us,&#8221; (<a name="ix.liv-p47.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#063">Eze 16:63</a><a name="ix.liv-p47.1"></A>,) but by freely pardoning our sins. Christ has included in two petitions all that related to the eternal salvation of the 			 soul, and to the spiritual life: for these are the two leading points of the divine covenant, in which all our salvation consists. He offers to us a free reconciliation by <i>&#8220;</i>not imputing our sins,&#8221; (<a name="ix.liv-p47.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019">2Co 5:19</a><a name="ix.liv-p47.2"></A>,) and promises the Spirit, to engrave the righteousness of the law on our hearts. We are commanded to ask both, and the prayer for obtaining the forgiveness of sins is placed 			 first.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p48"></A>In Matthew, sins are called <i>debts, </i>because they expose us to condemnation at the tribunal of God<i>, </i>and make us <i>debtors; </i>nay more, they alienate us 			 entirely from God, so that there is no hope of obtaining peace and favor except by pardon. And so is fulfilled what Paul tells us, that <i>&#8220;</i>all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God,&#8221; (<a name="ix.liv-p48.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023">Ro 3:23</a><a name="ix.liv-p48.1"></A>,)</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.liv-p49"></A><i>&#8220;</i>that every mouth may be stopped, and all the <br> 			 world may become guilty before God,&#8221; (<a name="ix.liv-p49.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019">Ro 3:19</a><a name="ix.liv-p49.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p50"></A>For, though the righteousness of God shines, to some extent, in the saints, yet, so long as they are surrounded by the flesh, they lie under the burden of sins. None will be found so pure as not to need the mercy of God, and if we wish to partake of it, we must feel our wretchedness. Those who dream of attaining such perfection in this world, as to be free from every spot and blemish, not only renounce their sins, but renounce Christ himself, 			 from whose Church they banish themselves. For<i>, </i>when he commands all his disciples to betake themselves to him daily for the forgiveness of sins, every one, who thinks that he has no need of such a remedy, is struck out of the number of the disciples.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p51"></A>Now, the forgiveness, which we here ask to be bestowed on us, is inconsistent with satisfaction, by which the world endeavors to purchase its own deliverance. For that creditor is not said to <i>forgive, </i>who has received payment and asks nothing more,&#8212;but he who willingly and generously departs from his just 			 claim, and frees the <i>debtor</i>  The ordinary distinction between <i>crime</i> and <i>punishment</i> has no place here: for <i>debts</i> unquestionably mean liability to punishment. If they are freely forgiven us, all compensations must disappear. And there is no other meaning than this in the passage of Luke, though he calls them <i>sins: 			 </i>for in no other way does God grant the pardon of them, than by removing the condemnation which they deserve.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p52"></A><i>As we forgive our debtors</i>  This condition is added, that no one may presume to approach God and ask forgiveness, who is not pure and free from all resentment. And yet the forgiveness, which we ask that God would give us, does not depend on the forgiveness which we grant to others: but the design of Christ was, 			 to exhort us, in this manner, to forgive the offenses which have been committed against us, and at the same time, to give, as it were, the impression of his seal, to ratify the confidence in our own forgiveness. Nor is any thing inconsistent with this in the phrase used by Luke, <a name="ix.liv-p52.1"></A>&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#947;&#8048;&#961;, for <i>we also</i>  Christ did not intend to point out the cause, but only to remind us of the feelings which we ought to cherish towards brethren, when we desire to be reconciled to God. And certainly, if the Spirit of God reigns in our hearts, every description of ill-will and revenge ought to be banished. The Spirit is the <i>witness</i> of our adoption, (<a name="ix.liv-p52.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016">Ro 8:16</a><a name="ix.liv-p52.2"></A>,) and therefore this is put down simply as a mark, to distinguish the children of God from strangers. The name <i>debtors</i> is here given, not to those who owe us money, or any other service, but to those who are <i>indebted to 			 us</i> on account of offenses which they have committed.</p>

<p><a name="ix.liv-p54"></A><b>13. </b><i>And lead us not into temptation</i>  Some people have split this petition into two. This is wrong: for the nature of the subject makes it manifest, that it is one and the same petition. The connection of the words also shows it: for the word <i>but, </i>which is placed between, connects the two clauses together, as Augustine judiciously explains. The sentence ought to be resolved thus, <i>That we may not be led into temptation, deliver us from evil</i>  The meaning is: &#8220;We are conscious Of our own weakness, and 			 desire to enjoy the protection of God, that we may remain impregnable against all the assaults of Satan.&#8221; We showed from the former petition, that no man can be reckoned a Christian, who does not acknowledge himself to be a sinner; and in the same manner, we conclude from this petition, that we have no strength for living a holy life, except so far as we obtain it from God. Whoever implores the assistance of God to overcome temptations, acknowledges that, unless God <i>deliver</i> him, he will be constantly falling.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_440"></A><A HREF="#fn_440"><FONT SIZE="1">441</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p56"></A>The word <i>temptation</i> is often used generally for any kind of trial. In this sense God is said to have <i>tempted Abraham, </i>(<a name="ix.liv-p56.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001">Ge 22:1</a><a name="ix.liv-p56.1"></A>,) when he tried his faith. We are <i>tempted</i> both by adversity and by prosperity: because each of them is an occasion of bringing to light feelings which were formerly concealed. But here it denotes inward <i>temptation, </i>which may be fitly called the scourge 			 of the devil, for exciting our lust. It would be foolish to ask, that God would keep us free from every thing which makes trial of our faith. All wicked emotions, which excite us to sin, are included under the name of <i>temptation</i>  Though it is not impossible that we may feel such pricks in our minds, (for, during the whole course of our life, we have a 			 constant warfare with the flesh,) yet we ask that the Lord would not cause us to be thrown down, or suffer us to be overwhelmed, by <i>temptations</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p57"></A>In order to express this truth more clearly, that we are liable to constant stumbling and ruinous falls, if God does not uphold us with his hand, Christ used this form of expression, <i>(</i><a name="ix.liv-p57.1"></A>&#956;&#8052; &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#949;&#957;&#8051;&#947;&#954;&#8031;&#962;<i>,) Lead us not into temptation: </i>or, as some render it, <i>Bring us not into temptation</i>  It is certainly true, that &#8220;every man is tempted,&#8221; as the Apostle James says, (<a name="ix.liv-p57.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#014">Jas 1:14</a><a name="ix.liv-p57.2"></A>) &#8220;by his own lust:&#8221; yet, 			 as God not only gives us up to the will of Satan, to kindle the flame of lust, but employs him as the agent of his wrath, when he chooses to drive men headlong to destruction, he may be also said, in a way peculiar to himself, to <i>lead them into temptation</i>  In the same sense, &#8220;an evil spirit from the Lord&#8221; 			 is said to have <i>&#8220;</i>seized or troubled Saul,&#8221; (<a name="ix.liv-p57.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#014">1Sa 16:14</a><a name="ix.liv-p57.3"></A>:) and there are many passages of Scripture to the same purpose. And yet we will not therefore say, that God is the author of evil: because, by giving men over to a reprobate mind,&#8221; (<a name="ix.liv-p57.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028">Ro 1:28</a><a name="ix.liv-p57.4"></A>,) he does not exercise a confused tyranny, but executes his just, though secret   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_441"></A><A HREF="#fn_441"><FONT SIZE="1">442</FONT></A>
 			  judgments.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p59"></A><i>Deliver us from evil</i>  The word <i>evil</i> (<a name="ix.liv-p59.1"></A>&#960;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#8166;) may either be taken in the neuter gender, as 			 signifying <i>the evil thing, </i>or in the masculine gender, as signifying <i>the evil one</i>  <i>Chrysostom</i> refers it to the Devil, who is the contriver of every thing evil, and, as the deadly enemy of our 			 salvation, is continually fighting against us.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_442"></A><A HREF="#fn_442"><FONT SIZE="1">443</FONT></A>
 			  But it may, with equal propriety, be explained as referring to <i>sin</i>  There is no necessity for raising a debate on this point: for the meaning remains nearly the same, that we are in danger from the devil and from sin, if the Lord does not protect and <i>deliver</i> us.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.liv-p61"></A><i>For thine is the kingdom</i>  It is surprising that this clause, which agrees so well with the rest of the prayer, has been left out by the Latins:   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_443"></A><A HREF="#fn_443"><FONT SIZE="1">444</FONT></A>
 			  for it was not added merely for the purpose of kindling our hearts to seek the glory of God, and of reminding us what ought to be the object of our prayers; but likewise to teach us, that our prayers, which are here dictated to us, are founded on God alone, that we may not rely on our own merits.</p>

After mentioning several views of Commentators on this petition, he says: This great variety of expositions has been principally occasioned by the Greek word &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;. That word occurs nowhere else in Scripture, and the most learned men have been unable to discover it in any profane writings. As it is not known to what Hebrew word employed by our Lord it corresponds, it is not surprising that different persons 				  should have assigned to it different acceptations. &#8212; I shall not now enter into a critical examination of the very numerous expositions of that word which have been given by learned men. An exposition more copious and learned than any that had previously appeared, has been given by a very celebrated and learned man, JOHN MARCK, formerly my much esteemed colleague in the University of Friesland. It forms a part of his <i>Juvenile Dissertations, </i>as 				  he is pleased to style them, but which contain much profound wisdom. The simplest and most probable of the various etymologies, I have always thought, is that which supposes &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#8057;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962; to be compounded of &#7952;&#960;&#8054; and &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#8055;&#945;<i>, </i>as &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962; is compounded of &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; and &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#8055;&#945;  The analogy of composition of such words presents no difficulty: for it does not require that the &#953; in the word &#7952;&#960;&#8054; shall be dropped before a vowel. This is proved by the words &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#949;&#953;&#954;&#8052;&#962;, &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#8057;&#947;&#948;&#959;&#959;&#962;, &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#8057;&#961;&#954;&#959;&#962;, &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#8057;&#960;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;, 				  &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#8166;&#961;&#959;&#962;, and many of the same form. This derivation being granted, which has nothing unusual or anomalous, considerable progress has been made in the investigation of the subject. For as &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957; signifies <i>what is more than enough, </i>and beyond what the preservation of existence requires, so &#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957; signifies what is enough.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.liv-p62"></A> That part of the Lord's Prayer, which we commonly call <i>the conclusion, </i>is not found in the Gospel by Luke, and its genuineness has been questioned. None of the Latin copies (as Calvin mentions) have it: but even those who have most zealously maintained that it is spurious, admit that it exists in the greater number of the Greek manuscripts. Erasmus, 				  Grotius, Witsius, Griesbach, Matthaei, and Scholz, may be consulted by those who wish to examine the question for themselves, and to hear all that has been said on both sides. Any thing like the summing up of the argument here would exceed the limits of a note. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>
