<span id="xi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="xi-p2"></span>In this narration we must consider three things
chiefly. That so soon as the truth of the gospel doth once appear, Satan
setteth himself against the same on the other side, so much as he is
able, and attempteth all things that he may smolder the same in the very
first beginnings. Secondly, That God doth furnish his children with
invincible force and strength,  <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200)
that they may stand steadfast and unmovable against all assaults of
Satan, and not yield unto the violence of the wicked. And, last of all,
we must note the event and end, that howsoever the adversaries seem to
bear the chiefest swing, and they themselves do omit nothing which may
serve to blot out the name of Christ; and, on the other side, howsoever
the ministers of sound doctrine be as sheep in the mouths of wolves, yet
doth God spread abroad the kingdom of his Son; he fostereth the light of
the gospel which is lighted; and he is the protector of his children.
Therefore, so often as the doctrine of the gospel ariseth, and divers
motions do rise on the other side, and the course thereof is letted
divers ways, there is no cause why godly minds should faint or quail, as
at some unwonted thing; but they ought rather to remember, that these
are ordinary endeavors of Satan, so that we must think upon this well
before it come to pass, that it cannot otherwise be but that Satan will
spew out all his might and main, so often as Christ doth come abroad
with his doctrine. And therewithal let us consider that the constancy of
the apostles is set forth unto us for an example, lest, being overcome
either with any perils, or threatenings, or terrors, we leap back from
that profession of faith which the Lord requireth at our hands. And,
moreover, let us comfort ourselves with this, that we need not to doubt
but that the Lord will give prosperous success when we have done our
duty faithfully.
