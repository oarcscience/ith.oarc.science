<p><a name="xiv.ii-p2"></A><b>5.</b> And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not the breadth of a foot; and promised that he would give it to him to possess, and to his seed after him, when as he had no son. <b>6.</b> And God spake after this manner, Thy seed shall sojourn in a strange land; and they shall bring it into bondage, and shall evil entreat it four hundred years. <b>7.</b> But the nation whom they shall serve will I judge, said God. And afterwards they 				  shall come out, and shall worship me in this place. <b>8.</b> And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so he begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.</p> 				  			   		    		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p3"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.ii-p4"></A><a name="xiv.ii-p4.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p5"></A><b>5.</b> We must note three firings in this place; that God exercised the patience of his servant, because, after that he had brought him out of his own country, he dwelt in the land of Canaan as a stranger.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p6"></A>[First,] For Abraham possessed not one foot&#8217;s-breadth, save only that which he bought to bury in. And that is counted no possession which serveth not for the uses of this life. Secondly, forasmuch as that field was bought, Stephen doth for good causes say, that God gave Abraham nothing. For that could not be gotten either with money, or by any other means which man could invent, which Abraham did hope for of the promise.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p7"></A>Secondly, we must note, that though God did not show Abraham the thing itself as yet, yet did he uphold him by his word. And this is our stay, when God promiseth that that is laid up for us which as yet we possess not. Therefore, when as the thing, that is, the possession of the land, was wanting, Abraham had for his help and stay the promise of God; and being content with the same alone, he desired nothing in the land of Canaan save only an 			 uncertain resting-place wherein he might sojourn.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p8"></A>For as much as [<a name="xiv.ii-p8.1"></A>&#949;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;] signifieth simply to promise, I thought there was no cause why, with Erasmus, I should translate it in this place, to <i>promise again. </i>For I resolve it adversatively, <i>although he had promised, </i>that by the 			 way we may note as it were, a show of deceiving,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_376"></A><A HREF="#fn_376"><FONT SIZE="1">377</FONT></A>
 			  unless peradventure some man be disposed to apply it unto the promises which are oftentimes repeated.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_377"></A><A HREF="#fn_377"><FONT SIZE="1">378</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p11"></A>Thirdly, we must note that the promise was such that it did not much differ from a mere mock. God promised the land to the seed of Abraham when he was fourscore years old, and had to wife one that was barren, neither had he any hope to have any issue. This seemeth to be more than frivolous. For why doth he not rather promise that he will give him seed? But this was a notable trial of faith, in that Abraham, without asking any question, or any 			 curious disputation, did obediently and meekly embrace that which he had heard proceed out of the mouth of the Lord. Therefore, let us remember that God doth so lift up and comfort his servant with his word, that he doth not only defer the giving of the thing,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_378"></A><A HREF="#fn_378"><FONT SIZE="1">379</FONT></A>
 			 but also he may seem after a sort to mock him; as he dealeth with us also in some respect. For, although he call us the heirs of the world, (<a name="xiv.ii-p12.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005">Jas 2:5</a><a name="xiv.ii-p12.2"></A>,) he suffereth us oftentimes to want even a competent living and necessary helps. And this doth he of set purpose, that he may bring the wisdom of the flesh to nought, seeing that we do not otherwise give due honor to his word.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.ii-p13"></A><a name="xiv.ii-p13.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p14"></A><b>6.</b> <i>Thy seed shall be a stranger.</i> Stephen putteth the Jews in mind in how miserable and reproachful an estate their fathers were in Egypt; and showeth that this their servitude, wherewith they were oppressed, came not by chance; because it was foretold long before by the oracle of God. 			 This history ought to have been of great force, partly to tame their lofty courages,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_379"></A><A HREF="#fn_379"><FONT SIZE="1">380</FONT></A>
 			  and to teach them modesty; partly to set forth the grace of God, because God had always had a care of that nation. For this is a singular benefit, in that the people are restored wonderfully, as it were, from death to life. In the mean season, the Jews are taught that the Church of God was elsewhere than in the land wherein they dwelt; that the fathers were chosen to be a peculiar people, and that they were kept safe under the tuition of God, before ever the temple 			 was built, or the external ceremonies of the law were instituted.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p16"></A>These things appertain unto the general scope or drift of the sermon. But hence may we gather a profitable admonition. Bondage is of itself hard and bitter; but when cruelty of masters is added thereunto, it seemeth to be intolerable. Wherefore, it must needs be that the mind of the godly man was sore wounded, when he heard that his seed should serve, and be villanously and cruelly entreated, Moreover, this was no small trial; forasmuch as 			 these things were, to look to contrary&#8212;the inheritance of the land of Canaan which was now promised, and bondage in a strange country. For who would not have thought that God had, as it were, forgotten his former promise, when as he telleth Abraham that his seed shall endure miserable bondage? He saith, at the first, that he will give his seed the land. But he had as yet no seed; yea, all hope of seed was now cut off. But when doth he promise that he will give it? After his death. By and by he 			 saith, that that seed should be carried away to another place, that it may serve strangers. And how long? Four hundred years. Doth he not seem, by this means, to pull back his hand, that he may not perform that which he had promised?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p17"></A>Let us know that this was done, (not once only,) for God dealeth oftentimes with us thus, so that he may seem contrary to himself; and he speaketh also in such sort as that he may seem to call back  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_380"></A><A HREF="#fn_380"><FONT SIZE="1">381</FONT></A>
 			 that which he had promised. Therefore, it cannot be but that flesh will judge that he is contrary to himself; but faith doth know that his words do agree well together amongst themselves, and with his works. And this is the purpose of God, to the end he may extend the sight of our faith the farther, to show his promises afar off, as it were, a long place [space] being put between. Therefore it is our duty to go forward, and to strive to attain unto that salvation which is set before 			 us through many straits,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_381"></A><A HREF="#fn_381"><FONT SIZE="1">382</FONT></A>
 			 through divers lets, through long distance, through the midst of deeps, and, finally, through death itself. Furthermore, seeing that we see that the people which God had chosen did serve the Egyptians, and was uncourteously  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_382"></A><A HREF="#fn_382"><FONT SIZE="1">383</FONT></A>
 			 afflicted, we must not be discouraged if the like condition be prepared for us at this day. For it is no new thing, neither any unwonted thing, for the Church of God to lie oppressed under tyranny, and to be, as it were, trodden under foot of the wicked.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.ii-p21"></A><a name="xiv.ii-p21.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p22"></A><b>7.</b><i> The nation whom they shall serve.</i> This judgment is joined with the deliverance of the people. For, whereas God doth punish the cruelty and tyranny of the wicked Egyptians, he doth that for his people&#8217;s sake, whom he took into his tuition, that it may be seen that he is the deliverer of his Church. Therefore, 			 so often as we are unjustly afflicted by the wicked, let us remember that God is the Judge of the world, who will let no injuries be unpunished. Let every man thus think with himself, Seeing that I am under the tuition of God, who is the Judge of the world, and to whom it belongeth to punish all injuries, those shall not escape his hand who trouble me now. There is the like place in <a name="xiv.ii-p22.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043">De 32:43</a><a name="xiv.ii-p22.1"></A>, where God saith that vengeance is his. Whence Paul gathereth that we must give place to wrath, (<a name="xiv.ii-p22.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019">Ro 12:19</a><a name="xiv.ii-p22.2"></A>;) as if he should say, that this ought to serve to reform impatience, and to bridle our evil affections, in that God promiseth that he will revenge; for he which revengeth himself doth take God&#8217;s office from him. And let us still remember that 			 which I have already said, that God is touched with an especial care to revenge injuries done to his children, as it is in the Psalm, &#8220;Hurt not mine anointed, and be not troublesome to my prophets.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p23"></A><i>They shall come thence and serve me. </i>Therefore their deliverance went before the temple and the worship of the law; whereupon it followeth, that the grace of God was not tied to ceremonies. Nevertheless, Stephen noteth the end of their deliverance, that God chose both a peculiar people and a peculiar place for the true worship of his name. Whence we gather 			 again, that we must regard what he commandeth and alloweth. Other nations also were determined to worship God; but because their rites were corrupt and bastardly,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_383"></A><A HREF="#fn_383"><FONT SIZE="1">384</FONT></A>
 			  God doth separate the Jews from the rest, and assigneth them a place where he will have them to worship him sincerely and duly as they ought. This place teacheth us, that God&#8217;s benefits must be referred to this end, that men might be brought to addict and give over themselves wholly to him. Now, since that God hath dispersed the treasures of his grace throughout the whole world, we must endeavor to sanctify him, by worshipping him purely and holily, in what country 			 soever we dwell.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.ii-p25"></A><a name="xiv.ii-p25.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xiv.ii-p26"></A><b>8.</b> <i>He gave him the covenant.</i> When as he confesseth that circumcision is the covenant of God, he cleareth himself sufficiently of that crime which was laid to his charge; but, in the mean season, he showeth that the Jews deal amiss, if they place the beginning of their salvation in the 			 external sign. For if Abraham was called, and the land and redemption promised to his seed before such time as he was circumcised, it appeareth that the glory of the whole stock cloth not depend upon circumcision. Paul useth the same argument in the 4th chapter to the Romans, (<a name="xiv.ii-p26.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011">Ro 4:11</a><a name="xiv.ii-p26.1"></A>.) For, seeing that Abraham obtained righteousness, and pleased God before he was circumcised, he 			 gathereth thence that circumcision is not the cause of righteousness. Therefore we see that Stephen frameth no vain and idle narration; because this was very much appertinent unto the cause, that the Jews might remember how God had adopted them with their fathers, and it is to be thought that Stephen did plainly express both things; that although circumcision was given by God, that it might be a sign of grace, yet was the adoption before it both in order and in time. But we have no need to 			 dispute any longer in this place concerning the nature and force of circumcision. Only let us note this, that God doth first promise those things to Abraham which he confirmeth afterward by circumcision, that we may know that the signs are vain and nothing worth, unless the word go before. Let us also note, that there is a profitable doctrine contained in the word <i>covenant,</i> to 			 wit, that God maketh his covenant with us in the sacraments, that he may declare his love toward us; which thing, if it be true, first, they are not only works of external profession amongst men, but they gave great force inwardly before God, to confirm the faith. Secondly, they are no vain figures; because God, who is true figureth nothing there which he doth not perform.</p>
