<span id="v-p1"></span>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.

<span id="v-p2"></span>THOU hast at length, (Christian reader,) through
the blessing of God, wherewith he hath blessed my labors, those learned
Commentaries of M. Calvin upon the Acts of the Apostles, though simply,
yet faithfully, turned into English; and though of many I was the
unmeetest to attempt this travail, yet such was the earnest request of
my godly friends, that unless I should have taken it in hand, I should
have seemed void of courtesy, and also of care to profit God’s Church. I
will not stand to rip up those commodities which thou by reading these
Commentaries mayest reap, but I leave them to thine own experience. What
my travail hath been in this work, those who have endured like toll can
best judge. And forasmuch as I know well, that after great painstaking
some things have escaped me, I beseech thee, (gentle reader,) condemn me
not rashly, but rather amend them friendly. If thou shalt grow forward
in *knowledge* by reading this work, then praise God, who hath by this
means made thee profit. God give thee good success in reading, that
thereby thou mayest both be better learned, and also better lived.

<span id="v-p3"></span>Thine in the Lord,  
CHRISTOPHER FETHERSTONE.
