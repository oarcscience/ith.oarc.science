<p><a name="viii.i-p2"></A><b>1.</b> The former speech truly have we had, O Theophilus, of all things which Jesus began to do and teach, <b>2.</b> Even until that day, wherein, after he had given commandment by the Holy Ghost to the apostles, which he had chosen, he was taken up.</p>

<p><a name="viii.i-p5"></A>That he may pass over unto those things which followed the ascension of Christ, he briefly gathereth the sum of all those which before he had handled in the former book, that he may annex this thereunto. And he briefly setteth down this description of the history of the gospel, that it is a narration of those things which Christ did and said so long as he was conversant upon earth. Furthermore, whereas they interpret this commonly, that there 			 was first in Christ purity of life, before such time as he began to preach, it maketh nothing unto Luke&#8217;s mind. Truth it is, that the manners of a good and godly teacher ought so to be framed, that he speak first with his life, then with his tongue, otherwise he should differ nothing from a stage-player. But Luke hath respect rather unto that which he had said about the end of his gospel, (<a name="viii.i-p5.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#019">Lu 24:19</a><a name="viii.i-p5.1"></A>,) namely, 			 that Christ was a prophet mighty in deed and word, that is, such a one as did excel no less in deeds than in words; although there be but small difference betwixt these two places. For the mightiness of works which is commended there doth belong unto his miracles, but this, <i>to do, </i>doth reach further in my opinion, namely, that under the same are comprehended all the famous acts which were proper unto his ministry, wherein his death and resurrection are the chiefest. For the office of the 			 Messias did not only consist in doctrine, but it was also behoveful that he should make peace between God and man, that he should be a Redeemer of the people, a restorer of the kingdom, and an author of everlasting felicity. All these things, I say, as they were promised of the Messias, so were they looked for at his hands.</p>  		  
<p><a name="viii.i-p6"></A>Now we see that the sum of the gospel consisteth of these two parts, namely, of the doctrine of Christ, and of his acts; forasmuch as he did not only bring unto men that embassage which was given him in charge of his Father, but also performed all things that could be required of the Messias. He began his kingdom, he pacified God with his sacrifice, he purged man&#8217;s sins with his own precious blood, he subdued death and the devil, he restored 			 us unto true liberty, he purchased righteousness and life for us. And to the end that whatsoever he either did or said might be certain, he proved himself by miracles to be the Son of God. So that this word, <i>to do, </i>is extended unto his miracles also; but it must not be restrained only unto the same. Here must we note, that those which have only the bare knowledge of the history have not the gospel; unless the knowledge of the doctrine which maketh manifest the fruits of the acts of 			 Christ be adjoined thereunto. For this is a holy knot which no man may dissolve. Therefore, whensoever mention is made of the doctrine of Christ, let us learn to adjoin thereunto his works, as seals whereby the truth thereof is established and confirmed, and the effect declared. Furthermore, that we may reap commodity by his death and resurrection, and also that miracles may have their use, we must always have respect unto him that speaketh. For this is the true rule of Christianity.</p>  		  
<p><a name="viii.i-p7"></A><b>1.</b> <i>Of all things which he began</i> I do not greatly mislike the interpretation which some give of this place that Luke said rather of <i>all </i>than <i>all; </i>because it is possible in some measure to 			 intreat of the works and doctrine of Christ, but to set down the whole course, that the narration may be perfect, were a matter of great   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A>
 			  weight. Like as John doth declare that the world could not contain the books, (<a name="viii.i-p8.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#025">Joh 21:25</a><a name="viii.i-p8.2"></A>.) That is also to be noted that Luke saith, that he began his history at the beginning of the works of Christ. But so soon as he hath declared the nativity of Christ, he passeth over unto the twelfth year of his age (<a name="viii.i-p8.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#042">Lu 2:42</a><a name="viii.i-p8.3"></A>;) and after he had briefly spoken of his disputation had in the temple with the doctors, passing over eighteen years without speaking any thing of them, he entereth [on] the just narration of the works of Christ. It is, therefore, manifest that those works and sayings only which make any thing unto the sum of our salvation are noted in this place. For, after that Christ came abroad into the world clothed with our 			 flesh, he lived privately at home until he was thirty years of age, at which time his Father put upon him another manner of person. God would have him to lead the former part of his life obscurely, to this end, that the knowledge of these things might be more excellent which do edify our faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="viii.i-p9"></A><i>The former speech.</i> It seemed good to me to translate this on this wise, because <a name="viii.i-p9.1"></A>&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#8048;&#953;, is the same with the Grecians, which <i>verba facere, </i>or to speak, is with the Latins, as Budaeus 			 doth note. And we must understand the contrariety of the second part, which he taketh in hand, that we may know that the evangelist determined with himself afresh to write, having new matter whereupon to write.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="viii.i-p10"></A><a name="viii.i-p10.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="viii.i-p11"></A><b>2</b> <i> Even until that day.</i> Therefore, the ascension of Christ is the end of the history of the gospel. For he hath ascended, saith Paul, that he might fulfill all things, (<a name="viii.i-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010">Eph 4:10</a><a name="viii.i-p11.1"></A>.) Our faith gathereth other fruit thereby; but it shall be sufficient to note in this place, that our redemption was fully complete and finished then when Christ did ascend unto his Father; and, therefore, that Luke did fully perform his duty in this narration, as touching the doctrine and works of Christ. And he is said to be taken up, that we may know that he is truly departed out of this world, lest we should consent unto their dotings who think that in his ascension there was 			 no alteration of place made.</p>  		  
<p><a name="viii.i-p12"></A><i>Commandment by the Holy Ghost</i> Luke showeth in these words, that Christ did not so depart out of the world that he did no longer care for us; for in that he hath ordained a perpetual government in his Church, he thereby declareth that he had a care to provide for our salvation; yea, he hath promised that he will be present with his to 			 the end, (<a name="viii.i-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020">Mt 28:20</a><a name="viii.i-p12.1"></A>,) like as, indeed, he is always present by his ministers. Luke, therefore, doth show unto us, that Christ did no sooner depart hence, but straightway he provided for the government of his Church; whence we may gather that he is careful for our salvation. And this his providence hath Paul plainly noted in the place lately cited, when he saith, That he hath 			 fulfilled all things, making some apostles, some evangelists, some pastors, etc. But these commandments, which the evangelist saith Christ gave unto his disciples, do I interpret of the preaching of the gospel; like as ambassadors use to be instructed with certain precepts before they go of their embassage, lest they should rashly attempt any thing contrary to his will and mind that sendeth them. And all this is spoken in commendation of that doctrine which the apostles taught. The which that 			 it may appear more manifestly, every thing is to be marked in order as it lieth. First of all, he saith they were elect and chosen of Christ, that we may be certain of their calling unto that function. Neither doth he in this place set God&#8217;s election against man&#8217;s merits, but only affirmeth that they were raised up by God, and that they did not rashly take upon them this function. That is true, indeed, that they were freely chosen; but now have we to inquire what is Luke&#8217;s drift in this place. 			 I say that he hath respect unto nothing else, but that we may be certain of the calling of the apostles, that we may learn not to have respect unto men, but unto the Son of God, the author thereof, because this must always be a maxim in the Church, that no man usurp any honor. Secondly, he saith, that they were instructed of Christ what they should do. As if he should say, that they uttered not their own inventions, but they delivered that sincerely and faithfully which was enjoined them by 			 their heavenly Master. And to the end that that which Christ taught them might be the more reverenced, he addeth this, that this was done by the direction of the Holy Ghost. Not because the Son of God had any need to be guided by any other, who is eternal wisdom, but because he was also man, lest any man should think that he did deliver those things unto his disciples which he delivered by man&#8217;s wit and reason, he calleth us back expressly unto the divine authority. Like as the Lord himself 			 doth so often affirm, that he taught nothing but that which he had received of his Father; and therefore he saith, that his doctrine was not his own. Therefore, he signifieth that in the preaching of the gospel there is nothing which issueth from man&#8217;s brain, but that it is the divine ordinance of the Spirit, whereunto the whole world must be subject.</p>
