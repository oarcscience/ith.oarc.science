<span id="xii.v-p1"></span><span id="xii.v-p1.1"></span>[Acts
5:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#027)<span id="xii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.v-p2"></span>**27.** And when they had brought them, they
set them before the council; and the chief priest asked them, **28.**
Saying, Did not we, in commanding, command you, that you should not
teach in this name? And behold ye have filled Jerusalem with your
doctrine, and you will bring the blood of this man upon us.

<span id="xii.v-p3"></span> 

<span id="xii.v-p4"></span><span id="xii.v-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xii.v-p5"></span>**28.** The chief priest layeth two crimes to
the charge of the apostles, for he accuseth them of contumacy or
stubbornness,  <span id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264) because they
obeyed not the decree of the council. In the second member he betrayeth
an evil conscience, or, at least, he showeth that he handled rather a
private business than any public cause, for he complaineth that the
apostles will cause the priests and the scribes to be hated for the
death of Christ. Behold, therefore, what that is which nettleth them,
because they fear the revenge and punishment of wicked murder. He
pretendeth, at the first, doctrine; but we may gather out of the end
that he was not so careful for doctrine. In the mean season, he accuseth
the apostles of sedition; for he taketh that for a thing which all men,
for the most part, did grant,  <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265)
that Christ was put to death justly. Notwithstanding this is the
principal point of the accusation, that they did not obey the
commandment of the priests. It was an heinous offense not to obey the
chief priest; how much more heinous was it, then, to despise the whole
order? But the chief priest doth not consider what is his duty towards
God and the Church;  <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266) he abuseth
his authority tyrannously, as if the same were not under any laws, as
the Pope dealeth with us at this day; for seeing that he taketh to
himself an unbridled authority and government, he feareth not to condemn
us for schismatics, so soon as he seeth us refuse his decrees; for he
catcheth at these sentences: “He which despiseth you despiseth me,”
(<span id="xii.v-p8.2"></span>[Lu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016)<span id="xii.v-p8.2"></span>;)
and thereupon he concludeth that we will rebel  <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267) against God. But if he will be heard
as the ambassador of Christ, he must speak out of the mouth of Christ.

<span id="xii.v-p10"></span>Now, forasmuch as he doth manifestly play
the minister of Satan, he borroweth authority, without shame and color,
of the name of Christ; yea, the very form of speech which the chief
priest useth doth prove how carelessly spiritual tyrants who usurp such
authority and lordship as is not subject to the word of God, dare grant
liberty to themselves to attempt whatsoever pleaseth them. With a
commandment (saith he) have we commanded. Whence cometh such strait
rigor, save only because they think that all that must be received
without exception which they shall command?
