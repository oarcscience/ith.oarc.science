<span id="xii.viii"></span>

<span id="xii.viii-p1"></span><span id="xii.viii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
5:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#040)<span
id="xii.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.viii-p2"></span>**40.** And they obeyed him. And when they
had called the apostles, having beaten them, they commanded them that
they should not speak in the name of Jesus; and they let them go.
**41.** Therefore they went rejoicing from the face of the council,
because they were counted worthy to suffer reproach for his name.
**42.** And they did not cease daily in the temple, and in every house,
to teach and preach Christ Jesus.

<span id="xii.viii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xii.viii-p4"></span><span id="xii.viii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xii.viii-p5"></span>**40.** *Having beaten them, they
commanded.* He saith that Gamaliel’s counsel was allowed; yet the
apostles are beaten, and forbidden to preach.  <span
id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292) Hereby we gather how great the rage of
the enemies was, who being now pacified, or at least mitigated, do yet,
notwithstanding, rage immoderately.  <span
id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293) And it appeareth also what evil
success those doubtful counsels have, wherein men alone are respected,
and the truth of God set aside. Gamaliel obtaineth thus much, that the
lives of the apostles may be saved;  <span
id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294) but, in the mean season, the Son of
God is blasphemed and slandered in their person; the truth of the gospel
is buried in eternal silence, so much as in the enemies lieth, God
surely doth by this means wonderfully spread abroad his word; yet that
counsel ceaseth not to be evil. Which we must note for this cause,
because most men at this day do think, that they do not a little obey
God, if they save the lives of those men which come in hazard for the
doctrine of the gospel, or somewhat appease  <span
id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295) the enemies who are otherwise bloody.
In the mean season, they are not afraid to drive them unto the wicked
denial of Christ, the confessing of whom is far more precious in the
sight of God than the life of all men. But what could they do who,
casting away all care of godliness, go about to redeem God’s favor with
the duty of courtesy?  <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296)

<span id="xii.viii-p11"></span><span id="xii.viii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xii.viii-p12"></span>**41.** *Then they went rejoicing.* We
must not think that the apostles were so senseless but that they felt
some shame and did also lament, when they felt the punishment; for they
had not quite put off nature;  <span id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297)
but when they considered the cause, then joy got the upperhand. So the
faithful must be two manner of ways affectioned so often as they suffer
persecution for the gospel; they must be touched with the bitterness of
punishments,  <span id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298) yet so that they
overcome this sorrow with spiritual joy. For they should have (changed
their mind, and) stricken sail by and by, unless they had been
strengthened and encouraged by that joy.  <span
id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299) And it is not to be doubted, but that
even death was sweet, and pleasant to Peter on this fashion, which,
notwithstanding the Lord doth testify shall be bitter unto him. Let us,
therefore, learn that we must wrestle with sorrow and care,  <span
id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300) that we hold on courageously to suffer
the cross, and that we bear the same when it is laid upon us.

<span id="xii.viii-p17"></span>*That they were counted worthy.* This
might seem at the first blush absurd, in that Luke placeth honor in
reproach;  <span id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301) but the disagreement
which is between God and the world causeth this, that that which is
counted amongst men most reproachful, excelleth in dignity and glory in
the sight of God and his angels. We know that the kind of death which
Christ suffered was of all other most shameful, and yet did he triumph
most nobly upon the cross; so, when we are made like unto him, we may
worthily boast that it is a point of singular excellency, that we suffer
rebuke in the sight of the world. Thus doth Paul boast of the marks of
Christ, (<span id="xii.viii-p18.2"></span>[Ga
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017)<span
id="xii.viii-p18.2"></span>.) For we must here respect the cause which
doth associate us unto Christ,  <span id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302)
who doth not only swallow up the shame of the world with his glory, but
doth also turn reproaches, slanders, and mocks of the world, into great
honor. Wherefore, it is no marvel that there be so few found which are
strong and stout to bear the cross, because we are almost all drowned
and overwhelmed with the sense of the flesh; and there is scarce one
amongst an hundred which considereth that the reproach of Christ doth
far excel all the triumphs of the world, which is the only matter of
comfort. Wherefore, we must use the greater diligence in thinking upon
this sentence; that we are at this day made partakers  <span
id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303) of the sufferings of Christ, that we
may be partakers of his glory.

<span id="xii.viii-p21"></span><span id="xii.viii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xii.viii-p22"></span>**42.** *They ceased not.* Constancy did
also accompany their Joy. For how is it that we are discouraged with
persecution, save only because none lifteth up himself unto Christ, that
he may in mind lay hold upon the fruit of victory, and so be pricked
forward unto patience? But that man which thinketh with himself that he
is happy when he suffereth for Christ’s sake, shall never faint, though
he must suffer hard conflicts. Therefore the apostles are, after a sort,
armed with stripes, so that they valiantly make haste unto death.
Therefore, woe be to our daintiness, who, having suffered a little
persecution, do by and by resign up the light  <span
id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304) to another, as if we were now old worn
soldiers.
