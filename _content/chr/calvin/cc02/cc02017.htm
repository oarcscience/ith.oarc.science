<p><a name="xviii.i-p14"></A><b>7.</b> And he asked Pharaoh&#8217;s officers that <i>were</i> with him in the ward of his lord&#8217;s house, saying, Wherefore look ye <i>so</i> sadly to day?</p>

<p><a name="xviii.i-p16"></A><b>8.</b> And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and <i>there is</i> no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, <i>Do</i> not interpretations <i>belong</i> to God? tell me <i>them</i>, I pray you.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p17"></A><b>8. </b>Et dixerunt ad eum, Somnium somniavimus, et qui interpretetur illud, non est. Et dixit ad eos Joseph, Nonne Dei sunt interpretationes? Narrate quaeso mihi.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p18"></A><b>9 </b>And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine <i>was</i> before me;</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p19"></A><b>9. </b>Et narravit princeps pincernarum somnium suum ipsi Joseph, et dixit ei, Me somniante, ecce, vitis erat coram me.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p20"></A><b>10. </b>And in the vine <i>were</i> three branches: and it <i>was</i> as though it budded, <i>and</i> her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p21"></A><b>10. </b>Et in vite erant tres rami, et dum floreret, ascendit flos ejus, et maturuerunt botri ejus in uvas.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p22"></A><b>11. </b>And Pharaoh&#8217;s cup <i>was</i> in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh&#8217;s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p><a name="xviii.i-p28"></A><b>14. </b>But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:</p>

<p><a name="xviii.i-p30"></A><b>15. </b>For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.</p>

<p><a name="xviii.i-p32"></A><b>16. </b>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also <i>was</i> in my dream, and, behold, <i>I had</i> three white baskets on my head:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p33"></A><b>16. </b>Et vidit princeps pistorum, quod bene interpretatus esset, et dixit ad Joseph, Etiam me somniante, ecce, tria canistra alba super caput meum.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p34"></A><b>17. </b>And in the uppermost basket <i>there was</i> of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.</p>

<p><a name="xviii.i-p36"></A><b>18. </b>And Joseph answered and said, This <i>is</i> the interpretation thereof: The three baskets <i>are</i> three days:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p37"></A><b>18. </b>Et respondit Joseph, et dixit, Haec est interpretatio ejus, Tria eanistra, tres dies sunt.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p38"></A><b>19.</b> Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.</p>

<p><a name="xviii.i-p40"></A><b>20. </b>And it came to pass the third day, <i>which was</i> Pharaoh&#8217;s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p41"></A><b>20. </b>Et fuit in die tertia, die qua natus fuerat Pharao, fecit convivium omnibus servis suis, et elevavit caput principis pincernarum et caput principis pistorum in medio servorum suorum.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p42"></A><b>21. </b>And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh&#8217;s hand:</p>

<p><a name="xviii.i-p50"></A><b>1.</b> <i>And it came to pass after these things</i>. We have already seen, that when Joseph was in bonds, God cared for him. For whence arose the relaxation afforded him, but from the divine favor? Therefore, God, before he opened the door for his servant&#8217;s deliverance, entered into the very prison to sustain him with 			 his strength. But a far more illustrious benefit follows; for he is not only liberated from prison, but exalted to the highest degree of honor. In the meantime, the providence of God led the holy man through wonderful and most intricate paths. The butler and baker of the king are cast into the prison; Joseph expounds to them their dreams. Restoration to his office having been promised to the butler, some light of hope beams upon the holy captive; for the butler agreed, after he should have 			 returned to his post, to become the advocate for Joseph&#8217;s pardon. But, again, that hope was speedily cut off, when the butler failed to speak a word to the king on behalf of the miserable captive. Joseph, therefore, seemed to himself to be buried in perpetual oblivion, until the Lord again suddenly rekindles the light which had been smothered, and almost extinguished. Thus, when he might have delivered the holy man directly from prison, he chose to lead him around by circuitous paths, the 			 better to prove his patience, and to manifest, by the mode of his deliverance, that he has wonderful methods of working, hidden from our view. He does this that we may learn not to measure, by our own sense, the salvation which he has promised us; but that we may suffer ourselves to be turned hither or thither by his hand, until he shall have performed his work. By the butler and the baker we are not to understand any common person of each rank, but those who presided over the rest; for, soon 			 afterwards, they are called eunuchs or nobles. Ridiculous is the fiction of the trifler Gerundensis, who, according to his manner, asserts that they were made eunuchs for the sake of infamy, because Pharaoh had been enraged against them. They were, in short, two of the chief men of the court. Moses now more clearly declares that the prison was under the authority of Potiphar. Whence we learn what I have before said, that his anger had been mitigated, since without his consent, the jailer could 			 not have acted with such clemency towards Joseph. Even Moses ascribes such a measure of humanity to Potiphar, that he committed the butler and baker to the charge of Joseph. Unless, perhaps, a new successor had been then appointed in Potiphar&#8217;s place; which, however, is easily refuted from the context, because a little afterwards Moses says that the master of Joseph was the captain of the guard, (<a name="xviii.i-p50.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#003">Ge 40:3</a><a name="xviii.i-p50.1"></A>.) When Moses says they were kept in prison <i>a season</i>, some understand by the word, <i>a whole year</i>; but in my judgment they are mistaken; it rather denotes a long but uncertain time, as appears from other places.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xviii.i-p51"></A><a name="xviii.i-p51.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.i-p52"></A><b>5.</b> <i>And they dreamed a dream</i>. What I have before alluded to respecting dreams must be recalled to memory; namely, that many frivolous things are presented to us, which pass away and are forgotten;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">150</FONT></A>
 			  some, however, have the force and significance of prophecy. Of this kind were these two dreams, by which God made known the hidden result of a future matter. For unless the mark of a celestial oracle had been engraven upon then, the butler and the baker would not have been in such consternation of mind. I acknowledge, indeed, that men are sometimes vehemently agitated by vain and rashly conceived dreams; yet their terror and anxiety gradually subsides; but God had 			 fixed an arrow in the minds of the butler and the baker, which would not suffer them to rest; and by this means, each was rendered more attentive to the interpretation of his dream. Moses, therefore, expressly declares that it was a presage of something certain.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xviii.i-p54"></A><a name="xviii.i-p54.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.i-p55"></A><b>6.</b> <i>And Joseph came in unto them, in the morning</i>. As I have lately said, we ought here to behold, with the eyes of faith, the wonderful providence of God. For, although the butler and baker are certainly informed of their own fate; yet this was not done so much out of regard to them, as in favor of Joseph; 			 whom God designed, by this method, to make known to the king. Therefore, by a secret instinct he had rendered them sad and astonished, as if he would lead them by the hand to his servant Joseph. It is, however, to be observed, that by a new inspiration of the Spirit, the gift of prophecy, which he had not before possessed, was imparted to him in the prison. When he had previously dreamed himself, he remained, for a while, in suspense and doubt respecting the divine revelation; but now he is a 			 certain interpreter to others. And though, when he was inquiring into the cause of their sadness, he perhaps did not think of dreams; yet, from the next verse it appears that he was conscious to himself of having received the gift of the Spirit; and, in this confidence, he exhorts them to relate the dreams, of which he was about to be the interpreter. <i>Do not interpretations</i> (he says) <i>belong to God</i>? Certainly he does not arrogantly transfer to himself what he acknowledges to be peculiar to God; but according to the means which his vocation supplied, he offers them his service. This must be noted, in order that no one may undesignedly usurp more to himself than he knows that God has granted him. For, on this account, Paul so diligently teaches that the gifts of 			 the Spirit are variously distributed, (<a name="xviii.i-p55.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004">1Co 12:4</a><a name="xviii.i-p55.1"></A>,) and that God has assigned to each a certain post, in order that no one may act ambitiously, or intrude himself into another&#8217;s office; but rather that each should keep himself within the bounds of his own calling. Unless this degree of moderation shall prevail, all things will necessarily be thrown into confusion; because 			 the truth of God will be distorted by the foolish temerity of many; peace and concord will be disturbed, and, in short, no good order will be maintained. Let us learn, therefore, that Joseph confidently promised an interpretation of the dreams, because he knew that he was furnished and adorned with this gift by God. The same remark applies to his interrogation respecting the dreams. For he does not attempt to proceed beyond what his own power authorized him to do: he does not, therefore, divine 			 what they had dreamed, but confesses it was hidden from him. The method pursued by Daniel was different, for he was enabled, by a direct revelation, to state and interpret the dream which had entirely escaped the memory of the king of Babylon. (<a name="xviii.i-p55.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#028">Da 2:28</a><a name="xviii.i-p55.2"></A>.) He, therefore, relying upon a larger measure of the Spirit, does not hesitate to profess that he can both divine and interpret 			 dreams. But Joseph, to whom the half only of these gifts was imparted, keeps himself within legitimate bounds. Besides, he not only guards himself against presumption; but, by declaring that whatever he has received is from God, he ingenuously testifies that he has nothing from himself. He does not, therefore, boast of his own quickness or clear-sightedness, but wishes only to be known as the servant of God. Let those who excel, follow this rule; lest, by ascribing too much to themselves, 			 (which commonly happens,) they obscure the grace of God. Moreover, this vanity is to be restrained, not only that God alone may be glorified, and may not be robbed of his right; but that prophets, and teachers, and all others who are indued with heavenly grace, may humbly submit themselves to the direction of the Spirit. What Moses says is also to be observed, that Joseph was concerned at the sadness of those who were with him in prison. For thus men become softened by their own afflictions, so 			 that they do not despise others who are in misery; and, in this way, common sufferings generate sympathy. Wherefore it is not wonderful that God should exercise us with various sorrows; since nothing is more becoming than humanity towards our brethren, who, being weighed down with trials, lie under contempt. This humanity, however, must be learned by experience; because our innate ferocity is more and more inflated by prosperity.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xviii.i-p56"></A><a name="xviii.i-p56.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.i-p57"></A><b>12. </b><i>The three branches are three days</i>. Joseph does not here offer what he thought to be probable, like some ambiguous conjecturer; but asserts, by the revelation of the Spirit, the meaning of the dream. For why does he say, that by the three branches, three <i>days</i> rather than 			 <i>years</i> are signified, unless because the Spirit of God had suggested it? Joseph, therefore, proceeds, by a special impulse above nature, to expound the dream; and by immediately commending himself to the butler, as if he was already restored, shows how certain and indubitable was the truth of his interpretation: as if he had said, &#8220;Be convinced that what thou hast heard of me has come from God.&#8221; Where also he shows how honorably he thinks of the 			 oracles of God, seeing that he pronounces concerning the future effect with as much confidence as if it had already taken place. But it may be deemed absurd, that Joseph asks for a reward of his prophecy. I answer, that he did not speak as one who would set the gift of God to sale: but it came into his mind, that a method of deliverance was now set before him by God, which it was not lawful for him to reject. Indeed, I do not doubt that a hope of better fortune had been divinely imparted to 			 him. For God, who, even from his childhood, had twice promised him dominion, did not leave him, amidst so many straits, entirely destitute of all consolation. Now this opportunity of seeking deliverance was offered to him by none but God. Wherefore, it is not surprising that Joseph should thus make use of it. With respect to the expression, <i>Lift up thine head;</i> it signifies to raise any one from a low and 			 contemptible condition, to one of some reputation. Therefore, &#8220;<i>Pharaoh will lift up thine head,&#8221; </i>means, he will bring thee forth from the darkness of the prisons, or he will raise thee who art fallen, and restore thee to thy former rank. For I take the word to mean simply <i>place</i> or <i>rank</i>, and not 			 <i>basis</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_150"></A><A HREF="#fn_150"><FONT SIZE="1">151</FONT></A>

 			  Although the expression show kindness is used among the Hebrews to describe the common exercise of humanity; there is yet no doubt that Joseph spoke simply as his own sad and afflicted condition suggested, for the purpose of inclining the mind of the butler to procure him help. He insists, however, chiefly on this, that he had been thrust into prison for no crime, in order that the butler might not refuse his assistance to an innocent man. For although they who are 			 most wicked find patrons; yet commendation elicited by importunity, which rescues a wicked man from deserved punishment, is in itself an odious and infamous thing. It is, however, probable that Joseph explained his whole cause, so that he fully convinced the butler of his innocence.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xviii.i-p62"></A><a name="xviii.i-p62.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.i-p63"></A><b>16. </b><i>When the chief baker saw</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_152"></A><A HREF="#fn_152"><FONT SIZE="1">153</FONT></A>
 			  He does not care respecting the skill and fidelity of Joseph as an interpreter; but because Joseph had brought good and useful tidings to his companion, he also desires an interpretation, which he hopes will prove according to his mind. So, many, with ardor and alacrity, desire the word of God, not because they simply wish to be governed by the Lord, and to know what is right, but because they dream of mere enjoyment. When, however, the doctrine does not correspond 			 with their wishes, they depart sorrowful and wounded. Now, although the explanation of the dream was about to prove unpleasant and severe; yet Joseph, by declaring, without ambiguity, what had been revealed unto him, executed with fidelity the office divinely committed to him. This freedom must be maintained by prophets and teachers, that they may not hesitate, by their teaching, to inflict a wound on those whom God has sentenced to death. All love to be flattered. Hence the majority of 			 teachers, in desiring to yield to the corrupt wishes of the world, adulterate the word of God. Wherefore, no one is a sincere minister of God&#8217;s word, but he, who despising reproach, and being ready, as often as it may be necessary, to attack various offenses, will frame his method of teaching according to the command of God. Joseph would, indeed, have preferred to augur well concerning both; but since it is not in his power to give a prosperous fortune to any one, nothing remains for him but 			 frankly to pronounce whatever he has received from the Lord. So, formerly, although the people chose for themselves prophets who would promise them abundance of wine and oil and corn, while they exclaimed loudly against the holy prophets, because they let fall nothing but threatening, (for these complaints are related in Micah,) yet it was the duty of the servants of the Lord, who had been sent to denounce vengeance, to proceed with severity, although they brought upon themselves hatred and 			 danger.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xviii.i-p65"></A><a name="xviii.i-p65.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.i-p66"></A><b>19. </b><i>Pharaoh shall lift up thy head from off thee</i>. This phrase (in the original) is ambiguous without some addition; and may be taken in a good or a bad sense; just as we say, &#8220;With <i>regard</i> to any one,&#8221; or &#8220;With <i>respect</i> to him;&#8221; here the 			 expression is added &#8220;from thee.&#8221; Yet there seems to be an allusion of this kind, as if Joseph had said, &#8220;Pharaoh will lift up thy head, that he may take it off.&#8221; Now, when Moses relates, that what Joseph had predicted happened to both of them, he proves by this sign that Joseph was a true prophet of God, as it is written in Jeremiah. (<a name="xviii.i-p66.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#009">Jer 28:9</a><a name="xviii.i-p66.1"></A>.) For that the prophets sometimes 			 threatened punishments, which God abstained from inflicting, was done for this reason, because to such prophecies a condition was annexed. But when the Lord speaks positively by his servants, it is necessary that whatever he predicts should be confirmed by the result. Therefore, Moses expressly commends in Joseph, his confidence in the heavenly oracle. With regard to what Moses records, that Pharaoh celebrated his birthday by a great feast, we know that this custom has always been in use, not 			 only among kings, but also among plebeian men. Nor is the custom to be condemned, if only men would keep the right end in view; namely, that of giving thanks unto God by whom they were created and brought up, and whom they have found, in innumerable ways, to be a beneficent Father. But such is the depravity of the world, that it greatly distorts those things which formerly were honestly instituted by their fathers, into contrary corruptions. Thus, by a vicious practice, it has become common for 			 nearly all to abandon themselves to luxury and wantonness on their birthday. In short, they keep up the memory of God, as the Author of their life, in such a manner as if it were their set purpose to forget Him.</p>

<p><a name="xviii.i-p68"></A><b>23. </b><i>Yet did not the chief butler remember</i>. This was the most severe trial of Joseph&#8217;s patience, as we have before intimated. For since he had obtained an advocate who, without trouble, was able to extricate him from prison, especially as the opportunity of doing so had been granted to him by God, he felt a certain assurance of 			 deliverance, and earnestly waited for it every hour. But when he had remained to the end of the second year in suspense, not only did this hope vanish, but greater despair than ever rested upon his mind. Therefore, we are all taught, in his person, that nothing is more improper, than to prescribe the time in which God shall help us; since he purposely, for a long season, keeps his own people in anxious suspense, that, by this very experiment, they may truly know what it is to trust in Him. 			 Besides, in this manner he designed openly to claim for himself the glory of Joseph&#8217;s liberation. For, if liberty had been granted to him through the entreaty of the butler, it would have been generally believed that this benefit was from man and not from God. Moreover, when Moses says, that the butler was forgetful of Joseph, let it be so understood, that he did not dare to make any mention of him, lest he should be subjected to reproach, or should be troublesome to the king himself. For it is 			 common with courtiers perfidiously to betray the innocent, and to deliver them to be slain, rather than to offend those of whom they themselves are afraid.</p>

The word <a name="xviii.i-p58.2"></A>&#1498;&#1513;&#1488;&#1512;, rendered 				  &#8220;thy head,&#8221; might be rendered &#8220;thy nail,&#8221; and some writers have supposed that it should be so translated in this place. The reason given for such a rendering arises from a supposed custom among eastern monarchs of having a large white tablet, on which the name of each officer of state was inscribed, and a nail was placed in a hole opposite the name. When the officer offended, the nail was removed 				  from its place, that is, from its basis or foundation, and the man&#8217;s distinction and character were lost. &#8212; <i>Junis</i> in Poli Synopsin. &#8212; <i>Ed</i></p> 			 </P>
