<p class="Normal"><a name="v.v.i-p9"></A><a name="v.v.i-p9.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p10"></A>He returns to his former doctrine, which he had touched upon in the second chapter; for many (as it is usual in new things) abused the name of Christ for the purpose of serving their own errors. Some made a half profession of Christ; and when they obtained a place among his friends, they had more opportunity to injure his cause. Satan took occasion to disturb the Church, especially through Christ himself; for he is the stone of offense, 				against whom all necessarily stumble who keep not on the right way, as shewn to us by God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p11"></A>But what the Apostle says consists of three parts. He first shews an evil dangerous to the faithful; and therefore he exhorts them to beware. He <i>prescribes </i>how they were to beware, that is, by making a distinction between the spirits; and this is the second part. In the third place, he points out a particular error, the most dangerous to them, he therefore forbids them to hear those who denied that the Son of God appeared in the 				flesh. We shall now consider each in order.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p12"></A>But though in the passage this reason is added, that many false prophets had gone forth into the world, yet it is convenient to begin with it. The announcement contains a useful admonition; for if Satan had then already seduced many, who under the name of Christ scattered their impostures, similar instances at this day ought not to terrify us. For it is the case perpetually with the Gospel, that Satan attempts to pollute and corrupt 				its purity by variety of errors. This our age has brought forth some horrible and monstrous sects; and for this reason many stand amazed; and not knowing where to turn, they cast aside every care for religion; for they find no more summary way for extricating themselves from the danger of errors. They thus, indeed, act most foolishly; for by shunning the light of truth, they cast themselves into the darkness of errors. Let, therefore, this fact remain fixed in our minds, that from the 				time the Gospel began to be preached, false prophets immediately appeared; and the fact will fortify us against such offenses.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p13"></A>The antiquity of errors keeps many, as it were, fast bound, so that they dare not emerge from them. But John points out here all intestine evil which was then in the Church. Now, if there were impostors mixed then with the Apostles and other faithful teachers, what wonder is it, that the doctrine of the Gospel has been long ago suppressed, and that many corruptions have prevailed in the world? There is, then, no reason why antiquity should 				hinder us to exercise our liberty in distinguishing between truth and falsehood.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p14"></A><b>1</b>  <i>Believe not every spirit</i>  When the Church is disturbed by discords and contentions, many, as it has been said, being frightened, depart from the Gospel. But the Spirit prescribes to us a far different remedy, that is, that the 				faithful should not receive any doctrine thoughtlessly and without discrimination. We ought, then, to take heed lest, being offended at the variety of opinions, we should discard teachers, and, together with them, the word of God. But this precaution is sufficient, that all are not to be heard indiscriminately.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p15"></A>The word <i>spirit </i>I take metonymically, as signifying him who boasts that he is endowed with the gift of the Spirit to perform his office as a prophet. For as it was not permitted to any one to speak in his own name, nor was credit given to speakers but as far as they were the organs of the Holy Spirit, in order that prophets might have more authority, God honored them with this name, as though he had separated them from mankind in 				general. Those, then, were called spirits, who, giving only a language to the oracles of the Holy Spirit, in a manner represented him. They brought nothing of their own, nor came they forth in their own name, but the design of this honorable title was, that God&#8217;s word should not lose the respect due to it through the humble condition of the minister. For God would have his word to be always received from the mouth of man no otherwise than if he himself had appeared from heaven.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p16"></A>Here Satan interposed, and having sent false teachers to adulterate God&#8217;s word, he gave them also this name, that they might more easily deceive. Thus false prophets have always been wont superciliously and boldly to claim for themselves whatever honor God had bestowed on his own servants. But the Apostle designedly made use of this name, lest they who falsely pretend God&#8217;s name should deceive us by their masks, as we see at this day; for 				many are so dazzled by the mere name of a Church, that they prefer, to their eternal ruin, to cleave to the Pope, than to deny him the least part of his authority.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p17"></A>We ought, therefore, to notice this concession: for the Apostle might have said that every sort of men ought not to be believed; but as false teachers claimed the Spirit, so he left them to do so, having at the same time reminded them that their claim was frivolous and nugatory, except they really exhibited what they professed, and that those were foolish who, being astonished at the very sound of so honorable a name, dared not to make any 				inquiry on the subject.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p18"></A><i>Try the spirits</i>  As all were not true prophets, the Apostle here declares that they ought to have been examined and tried. And he addresses not only the whole Church, but also every one of the faithful.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p19"></A>But it may be asked, whence have we this discernment? They who answer, that the word of God is the rule by which everything that men bring forward ought to be tried, say something, but not the whole. I grant that doctrines ought to be tested by God&#8217;s word; but except the Spirit of wisdom be present, to have God&#8217;s word in our hands will avail little or nothing, for its meaning will not appear to us; as, for instance, gold is tried by fire or 				touchstone, but it can only be done by those who understand the art; for neither the touchstone nor the fire can be of any use to the unskillful. That we may then be fit judges, we must necessarily be endowed with and directed by the Spirit of discernment. But as the Apostle would have commanded this in vain, were there no power of judging supplied, we may with certainty conclude, that the godly shall never be left destitute of the Spirit of wisdom as to what is necessary, provided they ask for 				him of the Lord. But the Spirit will only thus guide us to a right discrimination, when we render all our thoughts subject to God&#8217;s word; for it is, as it has been said, like the touchstone, yea, it ought to be deemed most necessary to us; for that alone is true doctrine which is drawn from it.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p20"></A>But here a difficult question arises: If every one has the right and the liberty to judge, nothing can be settled as certain, but on the contrary the whole of religion will be uncertain. To this I answer, that there is a twofold trial of doctrine, private and public. The private trial is that by which every one settles his own faith, when he wholly acquiesces in that doctrine which he knows has come from God; for consciences will never find 				a safe and tranquil port otherwise than in God. Public trial refers to the common consent and polity of the Church; for as there is danger lest fanatics should rise up, who may presumptuously boast that they are endued with the Spirit of God, it is a necessary remedy, that the faithful meet together and seek a way by which they may agree in a holy and godly manner. But as the old proverb is too true, &#8220;So many heads, so many opinions,&#8221; it is doubtless a singular work of God, when he subdues our 				perverseness and makes us to think the same thing, and to agree in a holy unity of faith.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p21"></A>But what Papists under this pretense hold, that whatever has been decreed in councils is to be deemed as certain oracles, because the Church has once proved them to be from God, is extremely frivolous. For though it be the ordinary way of seeking consent, to gather a godly and holy council, when controversies may be determined according to God&#8217;s word; yet God has never bound himself to the decrees of any council. Nor does it necessarily 				follow, that as soon as a hundred bishops or more meet together in any place, they have duly called on God and inquired at his mouth what is true; nay, nothing is more clear that they have often departed from the pure word of God. Then in this case also the trial which the Apostle prescribes ought to take place, so that the spirits may be proved.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.v.i-p22"></A><a name="v.v.i-p22.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p23"></A><b>2</b>  <i>Hereby</i>, or <i>by this</i>, <i>know ye</i>  He lays down a 				special mark by which they might more easily distinguish between true and false prophets. Yet he only repeats here what we have met with before, that as Christ is the object at which faith aims, so he is the stone at which all heretics stumble. As long then as we abide in Christ, there is safety; but when we depart from him, faith is lost, and all truth is rendered void.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">82</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p27"></A>But let us consider what this confession includes; for when the Apostle says that Christ <i>came</i>, we hence conclude that he was before with the Father; by which his eternal divinity is proved. By saying that he <i>came</i> <i>in the 				flesh</i>, he means that by putting on flesh, he became a real man, of the same nature with us, that he might become our brother, except that he was free from every sin and corruption. And lastly, by saying that he <i>came</i>, the cause of his coming must be noticed, for he was not sent by the Father for nothing. Hence on this depend the office and merits of 				Christ.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p28"></A>As, then, the ancient heretics departed from the faith, in one instance, by denying the divine, and in another by denying the human nature of Christ; so do the Papists at this day: though they confess Christ to be God and man, yet they by no means retain the confession which the Apostle requires, because they rob Christ of his own merit; for where freewill, merits of works, fictitious modes of worship, satisfactions, the advocacy of saints, 				are set up, how very little remains for Christ!</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p29"></A>The Apostle then meant this, that since the knowledge of Christ includes the sum and substance of the doctrine respecting true religion, our eyes ought to be directed to and fixed on that, so that we may not be deceived. And doubtless Christ is the end of the law and the prophets; nor do we learn anything else from the gospel but his power and grace.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.v.i-p30"></A><a name="v.v.i-p30.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p31"></A><b>3. </b><i>And this is that spirit of Antichrist</i>  The Apostle added this, to render more detestable the impostures which lead us away from Christ. We have already said that the doctrine respecting the kingdom of Antichrist was well known; so that the faithful had been warned as to the future 				scattering of the Church, in order that they might exercise vigilance. Justly then did they dread the name as something base and ominous. The Apostle says now, that all those who depreciated Christ were members of that kingdom.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.i-p32"></A>And he says that the <i>spirit of antichrist would</i> <i>come</i>, and that <i>it was already in the world</i>, but in a different sense. He means that it was already in the world, because it carried on in secret its iniquity. As, however, the truth of God had not as yet been subverted by false and spurious dogmas, as superstition had not as yet prevailed in corrupting the worship of God, as the world had not as yet perfidiously 				departed from Christ, as tyranny, opposed to the kingdom of Christ, had not as yet openly exalted itself, he therefore says, that it <i>would come</i>.</p>  <a name="v.v.ii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption16"><a name="v.v.ii-p1"></A><a name="v.v.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004">1 John 4:4-6</a><a name="v.v.ii-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p2"></A><b>4</b>. Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p3"></A><b>4</b>. Vos ex Deo estis, filioli, et vicistis eos; quia major est qui est in vobis, quam qui in mundo.</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p4"></A><b>5</b>. They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p5"></A><b>5</b>. Ipsi ex mundo sunt; propterea ex mundo loquuntur, et mundus eos audit.</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p6"></A><b>6</b>. We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p7"></A><b>6</b>. Nos ex Deo sumus; qui novit Deum, audit nos; qui non est ex Deo, non audit nos: in hoc cognocimus spiritum veritatis et spiritum erroris.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p8"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.v.ii-p9"></A><a name="v.v.ii-p9.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p10"></A><b>4</b>  <i>Ye are of God</i>  He had spoken of one antichrist; he now mentions many. But the many were the false prophets who had come forth before the head appeared.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">83</FONT></A>
 				 But the Apostle&#8217;s object was to animate the faithful, that they might courageously and boldly resist impostors, for alacrity is weakened when the issue of the contest is doubtful. Besides, it might have caused the good to fear, when they saw that hardly the kingdom of Christ had been set up, when enemies stood ready to suppress it. Though then they must contend, yet he says that they had conquered, because they would have a successful issue, as though he had said 				that they were already, though in the middle of the contest;, beyond any danger, because they would surely be conquerors.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p12"></A>But this truth ought to be farther extended, for whatever contests we may have with the world and the flesh, a certain victory is to follow. Hard and fierce conflicts indeed await us, and some continually succeed others; but as by Christ&#8217;s power we fight and are furnished with God&#8217;s weapons, we even by fighting and striving become conquerors. As to the main subject of this passage, it is a great consolation, that with whatever wiles Satan 				may assail us, we shall stand through the power of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p13"></A>But we must observe the reason which is immediately added, <i>because greater</i>, or <i>stronger</i>, <i>is he who is in you than he who is in the world</i>. For 				such is our infirmity, that we succumb before we engage with an enemy, for we are so immersed in ignorance that we are open to all kinds of fallacies, and Satan is wonderfully artful in deceiving. Were we to hold out for one day, yet a doubt may creep into our minds as to what would be the case tomorrow; we should thus be in a state of perpetual anxiety. Therefore the Apostle reminds us that we become strong, not by our own power, but by that of 				God. He hence concludes, that we can no more be conquered than God himself, who has armed us with his own power to the end of the world. But in this whole spiritual warfare this thought ought to dwell in our hearts, that it would be all over with us immediately were we to fight in our own strength; but that as God repels our enemies while we are reposing, victory is certain.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">84</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.v.ii-p15"></A><a name="v.v.ii-p15.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p16"></A><b>5</b>  <i>They are of the world</i>  It is no small consolation that they who dare to assail God in us, have only the world to aid and help them. And by the world the Apostle means that portion of which Satan is the prince. Another consolation is 				also added, when he says that the world embraces through the false prophets that which it acknowledges as its own.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">85</FONT></A>
 				 We see what great propensity to vanity and falsehood there is in men. Hence false doctrines easily penetrate and spread far and wide. The Apostle intimates that there is no reason why we should on this account be disturbed, for it is nothing new or unusual that the world, which is wholly fallacious, should readily hearken to what is false.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.v.ii-p18"></A><a name="v.v.ii-p18.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p19"></A><b>6</b>  <i>We are of God</i>  Though this really applies to all the godly, yet it refers properly to the faithful ministers of the Gospel; for the Apostle, through the confidence imparted by the Spirit, glories here that he and his 				fellow-ministers served God in sincerity, and derived from him whatever they taught. It happens that false prophets boast of the same thing, for it is their custom to deceive under the mask of God; but faithful ministers differ much from them, who declare nothing of themselves but what they really manifest in their conduct.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p20"></A>We ought, however, always to bear in mind the subject which he here handles; small was the number of the godly, and unbelief prevailed almost everywhere; few really adhered to the Gospel, the greater part were running headlong into errors. Hence was the occasion of stumbling. John, in order to obviate this, bids us to be content with the fewness of the faithful, because all God&#8217;s children honored him and submitted to his 				doctrine. For he immediately sets in opposition to this a contrary clause, that they who are <i>not of God</i>, do not hear the pure doctrine of the Gospel. By these words he intimates that the vast multitude to whom the Gospel is not acceptable, do not hear the faithful and true servants of God, because they are alienated from God himself. It is then no 				diminution to the authority of the Gospel that many reject it.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p21"></A>But to this doctrine is added a useful admonition, that by the obedience of faith we are to prove ourselves to be of God. Nothing is easier than to boast that we are of God; and hence nothing is more common among men, as the case is at this day with the Papists, who proudly vaunt that they are the worshippers of God, and yet they no less proudly reject the word of God. For though they pretend to believe God&#8217;s word, yet when they are brought 				to the test, they close their ears and will not hear, and yet to revere God&#8217;s word is the only true evidence that we fear him. Nor can the excuse, made by many, have any place here, that they shun the doctrine of the Gospel when proclaimed to them, because they are not fit to form a judgment; for it cannot be but that every one who really fears and obeys God, knows him in his word.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p22"></A>Were any one to object and say, that many of the elect do not immediately attain faith, nay, that at first they stubbornly resist; to this I answer, that at that time they are not to be regarded, as I think, as God&#8217;s children; for it is a sign of a reprobate man when the truth is perversely rejected by him.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p23"></A>And by the way, it must be observed, that the <i>hearing </i>mentioned by the Apostle, is to be understood of the inward and real hearing of the heart, which is done by faith.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p24"></A><i>Hereby know we</i>  The antecedent to <i>hereby</i>, or, <i>by this</i>, is included in the two preceding clauses, as though he had said, &#8220;Hence the truth is distinguished from 				falsehood, because some speak from God, others from the world.&#8221; But by the <i>spirit of truth and the spirit of error</i>, some think that hearers are meant, as though he had said, that those who give themselves up to be deceived by impostors, were born to error, and had in them the seed of falsehood; but that 				they who obey the word of God shew themselves by this <i>very </i>fact to be the children of the truth. This view I do not approve of. For as the Apostle takes spirits here metonymically for teachers or prophets, he means, I think, no other thing than that the trial of doctrine must be referred to these two things, whether it be from God or from the world.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">86</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.ii-p26"></A>However, by thus speaking he seems to say nothing; for all are ready to declare, that they do not speak except from God. So the Papists at this day boast with magisterial gravity, that all their inventions are the oracles of the Spirit. Nor does Mahomet assert that he has drawn his dotages except from heaven. The Egyptians also, in former times, pretended that all their mad absurdities, by which they infatuated themselves and others, had 				been revealed from above. But, to all this I reply, that we have the word of the Lord, which ought especially to be consulted. When, therefore, false spirits pretend the name of God, we must inquire from the Scriptures whether things are so. Provided a devout attention be exercised, accompanied with humility and meekness, the spirit of discernment will be given us, who, as a faithful interpreter, will open to us the meaning of what is said in Scripture.</p>  <a name="v.v.iii"></A>

<p><a name="v.v.iii-p12"></A><b>7</b>  <i>Beloved</i>  He returns to that exhortation which he enforces almost throughout the Epistle.

<p><a name="v.v.iii-p13"></A>When he commands <i>mutual </i>love, he does not mean that we discharge this duty when we love our friends, because they love us; but as he addresses in common the faithful, he could not have spoken otherwise than that they were to exercise mutual love. He confirms this sentence by a reason often adduced before, even because no one can prove himself to be the son of God, except he loves his neighbors, and because the true knowledge 				of God necessarily produces love in us.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.v.iii-p14"></A><a name="v.v.iii-p14.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.iii-p15"></A>He also sets in opposition to this, according to his usual manner, the contrary clause, that there is no knowledge of God where there is no love. And he takes as granted a general principle or truth, that God is love, that is, that his nature is to love men. I know that many reason more refinedly, and that the ancients especially have perverted this passage in order to prove the divinity of the Spirit. But the meaning of the Apostle 				is simply this, &#8212; that as God is the fountain of love, this effect flows from him, and is diffused wherever the knowledge of him comes, as he had at the beginning called him light, because there is nothing dark in him, but on the contrary he illuminates all things by his own brightness. Here then he does not speak of the essence of God, but only shews what he is found to be by us.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.iii-p16"></A>But two things in the Apostle&#8217;s words ought to be noticed, &#8212; that the true knowledge of God is that which regenerates and renews us, so that we become new creatures; and that hence it cannot be but that it must conform us to the image of God. Away, then, with that foolish gloss respecting unformed faith. For when any one separates faith from love, it is the same as though he attempted to take away heat from the sun.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.v.iii-p17"></A><a name="v.v.iii-p17.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.iii-p18"></A><b>9</b>  <i>In this was manifested</i>, or, <i>has appeared</i>. We have the love of God towards us testified also by many other proofs. For if it be asked, why the world has been created, why we have 				been placed in it to possess the dominion of the earth, why we are preserved in life to enjoy innumerable blessings, why we are endued with light and understanding, no other reason can be adduced, except the gratuitous love of God. But the Apostle here has chosen the principal evidence of it, and what far surpasses all other things. For it was not only an immeasurable love, that God spared not his own Son, that by his death he might restore us to life; but it was goodness the most marvelous, 				which ought to fill our minds with the greatest wonder and amazement. Christ, then, is so illustrious and singular a proof of divine love towards us, that whenever we look upon him, he fully confirms to us the truth that God is love.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.iii-p19"></A>He calls him <i>his only begotten</i>, for the sake of amplifying. For in this he more clearly shewed how singularly he loved us, because he exposed his only Son to death for our sakes. In the meantime, he who is his only Son by nature, makes many sons by grace and adoption, even all who, 				by faith, are united to his body. He expresses the end for which Christ has been sent by the Father, even that we may live through him, for without him we are all dead, but by his coming he brought life to us; and except our unbelief prevents the effect of his grace, we feel it in ourselves.</p>

<p><a name="v.v.iii-p21"></A><b>10</b> <i>Herein is love</i>  He amplifies God&#8217;s love by another reason, that he gave us his own Son at the time when we were enemies, as Paul teaches us, in <a name="v.v.iii-p21.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#008">Ro 5:8</a><a name="v.v.iii-p21.1"></A>; but he employs other words, that God, induced by no love of men, freely loved them. He meant by these words to teach us that God&#8217;s love towards us has been gratuitous. And though it was the Apostle&#8217;s object to set forth God as an example to be imitated by us; yet the doctrine of faith which he intermingles, ought not to be overlooked. God freely loved us, &#8212; how so? because he loved us 				before we were born, and also when, through depravity of nature, we had hearts turned away from him, and influenced by no right and pious feelings.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.iii-p22"></A>Were the prattlings of the Papists entertained, that every one is chosen by God as he foresees him to be worthy of love, this doctrine, that he first loved us, would not stand; for then our love to God would be first in order, though in time posterior. But the Apostle assumes this as an evident truth, taught in Scripture (of which these profane Sophists are ignorant,) that we are born so corrupt and depraved, that there is in us as it were 				an innate hatred to God, so that we desire nothing but what is displeasing to him, so that all the passions of our flesh carry on continual war with his righteousness.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.iii-p23"></A><i>And sent his Son</i>  It was then from God&#8217;s goodness alone, as from a fountain, that Christ with all his blessings has come to us. And as it is necessary to know, that we have salvation in Christ, because our heavenly Father has freely loved us; so when a real and full certainty of divine love towards us is 				sought for, we must look nowhere else but to Christ. Hence all who inquire, apart from Christ, what is settled respecting them in God&#8217;s secret counsel, are mad to their own ruin.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.iii-p24"></A>But he again points out the cause of Christ&#8217;s coming and his office, when he says that he was sent to be a <i>propitiation for our sins</i>  And first, indeed, we are taught by these words, that we were all through sin alienated from God, and that this alienation and discord remains until 				Christ intervenes to reconcile us. We are taught, secondly, that it is the beginning of our life, when God, having been pacified by the death of his Son, receives us unto favor: for <i>propitiation </i>properly refers to the sacrifice of his death. We find, then, that this honor of expiating for the sins of the world, and of thus taking away the enmity between God and us, belongs only to Christ.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.iii-p25"></A>But here some appearance of inconsistency arises. For if God loved us before Christ offered himself to death for us, what need was there for another reconciliation? Thus the death of Christ may seem to be superfluous. To this I answer, that when Christ is said to have reconciled the Father to us, this is to be referred to our apprehensions; for as we are conscious of being guilty, we cannot conceive of God otherwise than as of one 				displeased and angry with us, until Christ absolves us from guilt. For God, wherever sin appears, would have his wrath, and the judgment of eternal death, to be apprehended. It hence follows, that we cannot be otherwise than terrified by the present prospect. as to death, until Christ by his death abolishes sin, until he delivers us by his own blood from death. Further, God&#8217;s love requires righteousness; that we may then be persuaded that we are loved, we must necessarily come to Christ, in 				whom alone righteousness is to be found.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.iii-p26"></A>We now see that the variety of expressions, which occurs in Scripture, according to different aspects of things, is most appropriate and especially useful with regard to faith. God interposed his own Son to reconcile himself to us, because he loved us; but this love was hid, because we were in the meantime enemies to God, continually provoking his wrath. Besides, the fear and terror of an evil conscience took away from us all enjoyment of 				life. Thence as to the apprehension of our faith, God began to love us in Christ. And though the Apostle here speaks of the first reconciliation, let us yet know that to propitiate God to us by expiating sins is a perpetual benefit proceeding from Christ.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.iii-p27"></A>This the Papists also in part concede; but afterwards they extenuate and almost annihilate this grace, by introducing their fictitious satisfactions. For if men redeem themselves by their works, Christ cannot be the only true propitiation, as he is called here.</p>  <a name="v.v.iv"></A>

(<a name="v.v.iv-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002">Eph 5:2</a><a name="v.v.iv-p16.1"></A>.) And John reminds us, that our love ought not to be mercenary, when he bids us to love our neighbors as God has loved us; for we ought to remember this, that we have been loved freely. And doubtless when we regard our own advantage, or return good offices to friends, it is self-love, and not 				love to others.</p>

The Apostle here extends the same truth farther, that the power of God is comprehended by us by faith and love, so as to know that we are his children and that he dwells in us.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.iv-p19"></A>He speaks, however, first of love, when he says, that <i>God dwells in us, if we love one another; for perfected,</i> or <i>really proved to be</i>, <i>in us is then his love</i>; as though he had said, that God 				shews himself as present, when by his Spirit he forms our hearts so that they entertain brotherly love. For the same purpose he repeats what he had already said, that we know by the Spirit whom he has given us that he dwells in us; for it is a confirmation of the former sentence, because love is the effect or fruit of the Spirit.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.iv-p20"></A>The sum, then, of what is said is, that since love is from the Spirit of God, we cannot truly and with a sincere heart love the brethren, except the Spirit puts forth his power. In this way he testifies that he dwells in us. But God by his Spirit dwells in us; then, by love we prove that we have God abiding in us. On the other hand, whosoever boasts that he has God and loves not the brethren, his falsehood is proved by this one thing, 				because he separates God from himself.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.iv-p21"></A>When he says, <i>and his love is perfected</i>, the conjunction is to be taken as a causative, <i>for</i>, or, <i>because</i> <i> 				</i>And <i>love </i>here may be explained in two ways, either that which God shews to us, or that which he implants in us. That God has given his Spirit to us, or given us of his Spirit, means the same thing; for we know that the Spirit in a measure is given to each individual.</p>

It hence follows, that he is by faith 				received by us. For the design of the Apostle is to shew, that God is so united to us by faith and love, that he really dwells in us and renders himself in a manner visible by the effect of his power, who otherwise could not be seen by us.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.iv-p24"></A>When the Apostle says, <i>We have, seen and do testify</i>, he refers to himself and others. And by seeing, he does not mean any sort of seeing, but what belongs to faith by which they recognized the glory of God in Christ, according to what follows, that he was <i>sent to be the Savior of the world</i>; and this knowledge flows from the illumination of the Spirit.</p>

Besides, when he says <i>that Jesus is the Son of God</i>, he briefly includes the sum and substance of faith; for there is 				nothing necessary for salvation which faith finds not in Christ</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.iv-p27"></A>After having said in general, that men are so united to Christ by faith, that Christ unites them to God, he subjoined what they themselves had seen so that he accommodated a general truth to those to whom he was writing. Then follows the exhortation, to love one another as they were loved by God. Therefore the order and connection of his discourse is this, &#8212; Faith in Christ, makes God to dwell in men, and we are partakers of this 				grace; but as God is love, no one dwells in him except he loves his brethren. Then love ought to reign in us, since God unites himself to us.</p>

But we hence learn how different, is an uncertain or 				doubtful opinion from faith. Besides, though he meant here, as I have already said, to accommodate the last sentence to his readers, yet he defines faith in various ways. He had said before, that it is to confess that Jesus is the Son of God; but, he now says, We know by faith God&#8217;s love towards us. It hence appears, that the paternal love of God is found in Christ, and that nothing certain is known of Christ, except by those who know themselves 				to be the children of God by his grace. For the Father sets his own Son daily before us for this end, that he may adopt us in him.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.iv-p30"></A><i>God is love</i>  This is as it were the minor proposition in an argument; for from faith to love he reasons in this way: By faith God dwells in us, and God is love; then, wherever God abides, love ought to be there.

<p><a name="v.v.v-p8"></A><b>17</b> <i>Herein is our love made perfect</i>  There are two clauses in this passage, &#8212; that we are then partakers of divine adoption, when we resemble God as children their father; and<b>, </b>secondly, that this confidence is 				invaluable, for without it we must be most miserable.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.v-p9"></A>Then in the first place, he shews to what purpose God has in love embraced us, and how we enjoy that grace manifested to us in Christ. Then, God&#8217;s love to us is what is to be understood here. He says it is <i>perfected</i>, because it is abundantly poured forth and really given, that it appears to be complete. But he asserts that no others are partakers of this blessing; but those who, by being conformed to God, prove themselves to be 				his children. It is, then, an argument taken from what is an inseparable condition.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.v-p10"></A><i>That we may have boldness</i>  He now begins to shew the fruit of divine love towards us, though he afterwards shews it more clearly from the contrary effect. It is, however, an invaluable benefit, that we can dare boldly to stand before God. By nature, indeed, we dread the presence of God, and that justly; for, as 				he is the Judge of the world, and our sins hold us guilty, death and hell must come to our minds whenever we think of God. Hence is that dread which I have mentioned, which makes men shun God as much as they can. But John says that the faithful do not fear, when mention is made to them of the last judgment, but that on the contrary they go to God&#8217;s tribunal confidently and cheerfully, because they are assured of his paternal love. Every one, then, has made so much proficiency in faith, as he is 				well prepared in his mind to look forward to the day of judgment.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.v-p11"></A><i>As he is</i>  By these words, as it has been already said, he meant that it is required of us at our turn to resemble the image of God. What God then in heaven is, such he bids us to be in this world, in order that we may be deemed his children; for the image of God, when it appears in us, is as it were the seal of 				his adoption.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.v-p12"></A>But he seems thus to place a part of our confidence on works. Hence the Papists raise their crests here, as though John denied that we, relying on God&#8217;s grace alone, can have a sure confidence as to salvation without the help of works. But in this they are deceived, because they do not consider that the Apostle here does not refer to the cause of salvation, but to what is added to it. And we readily allow that no one is 				reconciled to God through Christ, except he is also renewed after God&#8217;s image, and that the one cannot be disjoined from the other. Right then is what is done by the Apostle, who excludes from the confidence of grace all those in whom no image of God is seen; for it is certain that such are wholly aliens to the Spirit of God and to Christ. Nor do we deny that newness of life, as it is the effect of divine adoption, serves to confirm confidence, 				as a prop, so to speak, of the second order; but in the meantime we ought to have our foundation on grace alone.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">87</FONT></A>
 				 Nor indeed does the doctrine of John appear otherwise consistent with itself; for experience proves, and even Papists are forced to confess, that as to works they always give an occasion for trembling. Therefore no one can come with a tranquil mind to God&#8217;s tribunal, except he believes that he is freely loved.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.v-p14"></A>But that none of these things please the Papists, there is no reason for any one to wonder, since being miserable they know no faith except that which is entangled with doubts. Besides, hypocrisy brings darkness over them, so that they do not seriously consider how formidable is God&#8217;s judgment when Christ the Mediator is not present, and some of them regard the resurrection as fabulous. But that we may cheerfully and joyfully go forth 				to meet Christ, we must have our faith fixed on his grace alone.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="v.v.v-p15"></A><a name="v.v.v-p15.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.v-p16"></A><b>18</b> <i>There is no fear</i>  He now commends the excellency of this blessing by stating the contrary effect, for he says that we are continually tormented until God delivers us from misery and anguish by the remedy of his own love towards us. The meaning is, that as 				there is nothing more miserable than to be harassed by continual inquietude, we obtain by knowing God&#8217;s love towards us the benefit of a peaceful calmness beyond the reach of fear. It hence appears what a singular gift of God it is to be favored with his love. Moreover from this doctrine, he will presently draw an exhortation; but before he exhorts us to duty, he commends to us this gift of God, which by faith removes our fear.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.v-p17"></A>This passage, I know, is explained otherwise by many; but I regard what the Apostle means, not what others think. They say that there is no fear in love, because, when we voluntarily love God, we are not constrained by force and fear to serve him. Then according to them, servile fear is here set in opposition to voluntary reverence; and hence has arisen the distinction between servile and filial fear. I indeed allow it to be true, that when 				we willingly love God as a Father, we are no longer constrained by the fear of punishment; but this doctrine has nothing in common with this passage, for the Apostle only teaches us, that when the love of God is by us seen and known by faith, peace is given to our consciences, so that they no longer tremble and fear.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.v-p18"></A>It may, however, be asked, when does perfect love expel fear, for since we are endued with some taste only of divine love towards us, we can never be wholly freed from fear? To this I answer, that, though fear is not wholly shaken off, yet when we flee to God as to a quiet harbor, safe and free from all danger of shipwreck and of tempests, fear is really expelled, for it gives way to faith. Then fear is not so expelled, but that it assails 				our minds, but it is so expelled that it does not torment us nor impede that peace which we obtain by faith.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.v-p19"></A><i>Fear hath torment</i>  Here the Apostle amplifies still further the greatness of that grace of which he speaks; for as it is a most miserable condition to suffer continual torments, there is nothing more to be wished than to present ourselves before God with a quiet conscience and a calm mind. What some say, that 				servants fear, because they have before their eyes punishment and the rod, and that they do not their duty except when forced, has nothing to do, as it has been already stated, with what the Apostle says here. So in the next clause, the exposition given, that he who fears is not perfect in love, because he submits not willingly to God, but would rather free himself from his service, does not comport at all with the context. For the Apostle, on 				the contrary, reminds us, that it is owing to unbelief when any one fears, that is, has a disturbed mind; for the love of God, really known, tranquilizes the heart.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">88</FONT></A>

<p><a name="v.v.vi-p10"></A><b>19</b> <i>We love him</i>  The verb <a name="v.v.vi-p10.1"></A>&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#8182;&#956;&#949;&#957; may be either in the indicative or imperative mood; but the former is the more suitable here, for the Apostle, as I think, 				repeats the preceding sentence, that as God has anticipated us by his free love, we ought to return to render love to him, for he immediately infers that he ought to be loved in men, or that the love we have for him ought to be manifested towards men. If, however, the imperative mood be preferred, the meaning would be nearly the same, that as God has freely loved us, we also ought now to love him.</p>

<p><a name="v.v.vi-p12"></A>But this love cannot exist, except it generates brotherly love. Hence he says, that they are liars who boast that they love God, when they hate their brethren.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.vi-p13"></A>But the reason he subjoins seems not sufficiently valid, for it is a comparison between the less and the greater: If, he says, we love not our brethren whom we see, much less can we love God who is invisible. Now there are obviously two exceptions; for the love which God has to us is from faith and does not flow from sight, as we find in <a name="v.v.vi-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008">1Pe 1:8</a><a name="v.v.vi-p13.1"></A>; 				and secondly, far different is the love of God from the love of men; for while God leads his people to love him through his infinite goodness, men are often worthy of hatred. To this I answer, that the Apostle takes here as granted what ought no doubt to appear evident to us, that God offers himself to us in those men who bear his image, and that he requires the duties, which he does not want himself, to be performed to them, according to 				<a name="v.v.vi-p13.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002">Ps. 16:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003">3</a><a name="v.v.vi-p13.2"></A>, where we read,</p>  			 
<p class="Center"><a name="v.v.vi-p14"></A>&#8220;My goodness reaches not to thee, O Lord;<br> 				towards the saints who are on the earth is my love.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.v.vi-p15"></A>And surely the participation of the same nature, the need of so many things, and mutual intercourse, must allure us to mutual love, except; we are harder than iron. But John meant another thing: he meant to shew how fallacious is the boast of every one who says that he loves God, and yet loves not God&#8217;s image which is before his eyes.</p>

<p><a name="v.v.vi-p17"></A><b>21</b> <i>And this commandment</i>  This is a stronger argument, drawn from the authority and doctrine of Christ; for he not only gave a commandment respecting the love of God, but bade us also to love our brethren. We must therefore so begin with God, as that there may 				be at the same time a transition made to men.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="v.v.i-p24"></A> It appears that by &#8220;spirit&#8221; throughout this passage, we are to understand a teacher claiming, rightly or falsely, to be influenced by God&#8217;s Spirit. Nor would it be improper, but suitable to the context, to consider the spirit of God in this verse as meaning a teacher guided by God. The meaning of the passage might be thus expressed, &#8212;</p>  				  
<p><a name="v.v.i-p25"></A><b>2</b>. &#8220;By this know ye the teacher of God; every teacher who confesses Jesus Christ as having come in the flesh, is from God; and</p>  				  
<p><a name="v.v.i-p26"></A><b>3</b>. every teacher who does not confess Jesus Christ as having come in the flesh, is not from God; and this is the teacher of Antichrist, (or, the Anti Christian teacher,) of whom ye have heard that he is coming, and he is now already in the world.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed</i></p> 				</P>

It is usual with John to refer to antecedents at some distance. See <a name="v.v.ii-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016">Joh 3:16</a><a name="v.v.ii-p11.1"></A>. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</p> 				</P>

Hence it follows, &#8220;They are of the world,&#8221; that is, they are of the number of those who are ungodly and wicked, who make up the kingdom of darkness. &#8212; 					 <i>Ed</i>.</p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="v.v.ii-p25"></A> According to this view, &#8220;the spirit of truth&#8221; means the teacher of truth, and &#8220;the spirit of error&#8221; the teacher of error; and this is agreeable to the whole tenor of the context, the spirit throughout denoting the person who claimed, rightly or falsely, to be under the direction of the divine Spirit. &#8220;By this,&#8221; refers to what had been just stated, that is, that false teachers were of the world, and spake things agreeable to the worldly-minded, 					 and were heard by the world, and that the true teachers were from God, and were heard or attended to by those who knew God, and were not attended to by such as were ignorant of him. It was by this statement which he had made, they could distinguish between the teacher of truth and the teacher of error. The teacher of truth was one from God, and was attended to by those who knew God, and not by those who knew him not; on the other hand, the teacher of error was from the world, preached what was 					 agreeable to the men of the world, and was hearkened to by them. The order, as it is often the case, is inverted; the teacher of error, mentioned last, is described in the fifth verse, and the teacher of truth, mentioned first, at the beginning of the sixth. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="v.v.v-p13"></A> What is love? It is as much a gift, a grace, as faith; it constitutes a fitness for heaven, but is in no way meritorious; and were it perfect, there would be nothing of merit in it; for the highest degrees of it come far short of what is due to God. To set up merit of any kind on the part of man, betokens extreme blindness, for salvation from first to last is altogether gratuitous. &#8212; <i>Ed</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="v.v.v-p20"></A> <i>Beza</i>,<i> Doddridge</i>,<i> Scott</i>, and most commentators, regard <i>love </i>here as that which is in us, and not the love of God as apprehended by faith. The <i>main</i> subject of the Apostle is love in us, and the words &#8220;perfected&#8221; and &#8220;<i>perfect</i>,&#8221; as applied to it, seem inappropriate to God&#8217;s love towards us; and this perfection is said in verse 17th to consist in this, that as God is, so are we in this world; that is, like him in love, as God is said in the previous verse to be love.</p>  				  
<p><a name="v.v.v-p21"></A>&#8220;Fear&#8221; is the fear of judgment, mentioned in verse 17th, and he who fears is said to be not perfected or made perfect in love, which obviously refers to love in us. And then it immediately follows, &#8220;We <i>love </i>him,&#8221; and the reason is assigned, &#8220;because he first loved us.&#8221; He afterwards proceeds to show the indispensable necessity of having love to God and to the brethren &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</p> 				</P>
