<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p12"></A><b>1.</b> <i>Simon Peter.</i> Prayer takes the first place at the beginning of this Epistle, and then follows thanksgiving, by which he excites the Jews to gratitude, lest they should forget what great benefits they had already received from God's hand. Why he called himself the <i>servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ</i>, we have elsewhere stated, even because no one is to be heard in the Church, except he speaks as from the mouth of Christ. But the word <i>servant</i> has a more general meaning, because it includes all the ministers of Christ, who sustain any public office in the Church. There was in the apostleship a higher rank 				of honor. He then intimates, that he was not one from the rank of ministers, but was made by the Lord an apostle, and therefore superior to them.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">144</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p14"></A><i>Like precious faith.</i> This is a commendation of the grace which God had indiscriminately shewed to all his elect people; for it was no common gift, that they had all been called to one and the same faith, since faith is the special and chief good of man. But he calls it <i>like</i> or equally<i> precious,</i> not that it is equal in all, but because all possess by faith the same Christ with his righteousness, and the same salvation. Though then the measure is different, that does not prevent the knowledge of God from being common to all, and the fruit which proceeds from it. Thus we have a real fellowship of faith with Peter and the Apostles.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p15"></A>He adds, <i>through the righteousness of God, </i>in order that they might know that they did not obtain faith through their own efforts or strength, but through God's favor alone. For these things stand opposed the one to the other, the righteousness of God (in the sense in which it is taken here) and the merit of man. For the 				efficient cause of faith is called God's righteousness for this reason, because no one is capable of conferring it on himself. So the righteousness that is to be understood, is not that which remains in God, but that which he imparts to men, as in <a name="vii.ii.i-p15.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022">Ro 3:22</a><a name="vii.ii.i-p15.1"></A>. Besides, he ascribes this righteousness in common to God and to Christ, because it flows from God, and through Christ it flows 				down to us.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">145</FONT></A>

<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.ii.i-p17"></A><a name="vii.ii.i-p17.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p18"></A><b>2.</b> <i>Grace and peace.</i> By grace is designated God&#8217;s paternal favor towards us. We have indeed been once for all reconciled to God by the death of Christ, and by faith we come to the possession of this so great a benefit; but as we perceive the grace of God according to the measure of our faith, it is said to 				increase according to our perception when it becomes more fully known to us.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p19"></A><i>Peace</i> is added; for as the beginning of our happiness is when God receives us into favor; so the more he confirms his love in our hearts, the richer blessing he confers on us, so that we become happy and prosperous in all things,</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p20"></A><i>Through the knowledge,</i> literally, <i>in the knowledge</i>; but the preposition <a name="vii.ii.i-p20.1"></A>&#7952;&#957; often means &#8220;through&#8221; or &#8220;with:&#8221; yet both senses may suit the context. I am, however, more disposed to adopt the former. For the 				more any one advances in the knowledge of God, every kind of blessing increases also equally with the sense of divine love. Whosoever then aspires to the full fruition of the blessed life which is mentioned by Peter, must remember to observe the right way. He connects together at the same time the knowledge of God and of Christ; because God cannot be rightly known except in Christ, according to that saying,</p>  			 
<p class="Center"><a name="vii.ii.i-p21"></A>&#8220;No one knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom<br> 				the Son will reveal him.&#8221; (<a name="vii.ii.i-p21.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027">Mt 11:27</a><a name="vii.ii.i-p21.2"></A>)</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.ii.i-p22"></A><a name="vii.ii.i-p22.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p23"></A><b>3.</b> <i>According as his divine power.</i> He refers to the infinite goodness of God which they had already experienced, that they might more fully understand it for the future. For he continues the course of his benevolence perpetually to the end, except when we ourselves break it off by our unbelief; for he 				possesses exhaustless power and an equal will to do good. Hence the Apostle justly animates the faithful to entertain good hope by the consideration of the former benefits of God.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">146</FONT></A>
 				 For the same purpose is the amplification which he makes; for he might have spoken more simply, &#8220;As he has freely given us all things.&#8221; But by mentioning &#8220;divine power,&#8221; he rises higher, that is, that God has copiously unfolded the immense resources of his power. But the latter clause may be referred to Christ as well as to the Father, but both are suitable. It may however be more fitly applied to Christ, as though he had said, that the grace which is conveyed to 				us by him, is an evidence of divinity, because it could not have done by humanity.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p25"></A><i>That pertain to life and godliness</i>, or, <i>as to life and godliness</i>. Some think that the present life is meant here, as godliness follows as the more excellent gift; as though by those two words Peter intended to prove how beneficent and bountiful God is towards the faithful, that he brought them to light, 				that he supplies them with all things necessary for the preservation of an earthly life, and that he has also renewed them to a spiritual life by adorning them with godliness. But this distinction is foreign to the mind of Peter, for as soon as he mentioned life, he immediately added godliness, which is as it were its soul; for God then truly gives us life, when he renews us unto the obedience of righteousness. So Peter does not speak here of the natural gifts of God, but only mentions those 				things which he confers peculiarly on his own elect above the common order of nature.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">147</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p27"></A>That we are born men, that we are endued with reason and knowledge, that our life is supplied with necessary support, &#8212; all this is indeed from God. As however men, being perverted in their minds and ungrateful, do not regard these various things, which are called the gifts of nature, among God's benefits, the common condition of human life is not here referred to, but the peculiar endowments of the new and Spiritual life, which derive 				their origin from the kingdom of Christ. But since everything necessary for godliness and salvation is to be deemed among the supernatural gifts of God, let men learn to arrogate nothing to themselves, but humbly ask of God whatever they see they are wanting in, and to ascribe to him whatever good they may have. For Peter here, by attributing the whole of godliness, and all helps to salvation, to the divine power of Christ, takes them away from the common nature of men, so that he leaves to us 				not even the least particle of any virtue or merit.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p28"></A><i>Through the knowledge of him</i>. He now describes the manner in which God makes us partakers of so great blessings, even by making himself known to us by the gospel. For the knowledge of God is the beginning of life and the first entrance into godliness. In short, spiritual gifts cannot be given for salvation, until, being illuminated by the doctrine of the 				gospel, we are led to know God. But he makes God the author of this knowledge, because we never go to him except when called. Hence the effectual cause of faith is not the perspicacity of our mind, but the calling of God. And he speaks not of the outward calling only, which is in itself ineffectual; but of the inward calling, effected by the hidden power of the Spirit when God not only sounds in our ears by the voice of man, but draws inwardly our hearts to himself by his own Spirit.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p29"></A><i>To glory and virtue,</i> or, <i>by his own glory and power</i>. Some copies have <a name="vii.ii.i-p29.1"></A>&#7984;&#948;&#8055;&#945; &#948;&#8057;&#958;&#8031;, &#8220;by his own glory," and it is so rendered by the old interpreter; and this reading I prefer, because the sentence seems thus 				to flow better For it was Peter's object expressly to ascribe the whole praise of our salvation to God, so that we may know that we owe every thing to him. And this is more clearly expressed by these words, &#8212; that he has called us <i>by his own glory and power</i>. However, the other reading, though more obscure, tends to the same thing; for he teaches us, that we are covered with shame, and are wholly vicious, until God clothes us with glory and 				adorns us with virtue. He further intimates, that the effect of calling in the elect, is to restore to them the glorious image of God, and to renew them in holiness and righteousness.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.ii.i-p30"></A><a name="vii.ii.i-p30.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p31"></A><b>4.</b> <i>Whereby are given to us.</i> It is doubtful whether he refers only to glory and power, or to the preceding things also. The whole difficulty arises from this, &#8212; that what is here said is not suitable to the glory and virtue which God confers on us; but if we read, &#8220;by his own glory and power,&#8221; there will 				be no ambiguity nor perplexity. For what things have been promised to us by God, ought to be properly and justly deemed to be the effects of his power and glory.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_147"></A><A HREF="#fn_147"><FONT SIZE="1">148</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p34"></A>At the same time the copies vary here also; for some have <a name="vii.ii.i-p34.1"></A>&#948;&#953; &#8127; &#8003;&#957;, &#8220;on account of whom;&#8221; so the reference may be to Christ. Whichsoever of the two readings you choose, still the meaning will be, that first the promises of God ought to be most highly valued; and, secondly, that they are gratuitous, because they are offered 				to us as gifts. And he then shews the excellency of the promises, that they make us partakers of the divine nature, than which nothing can be conceived better.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p35"></A>For we must consider from whence it is that God raises us up to such a height of honor. We know how abject is the condition of our nature; that God, then, should make himself ours, so that all his things should in a manner become our things, the greatness of his grace cannot be sufficiently conceived by our minds. Therefore this consideration alone ought to be abundantly sufficient to make us to renounce the world and to carry us aloft to 				heaven. Let us then mark, that the end of the gospel is, to render us eventually conformable to God, and, if we may so speak, to deify us.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p36"></A>But the word <i>nature</i> is not here essence but <i>quality</i>. The Manicheans formerly dreamt that we are a part of God, and that, after having run the race of life we shall at length revert to our original. There are also at this day fanatics who imagine that we 				thus pass over into the nature of God, so that his swallows up our nature. Thus they explain what Paul says, that God will be all in all (<a name="vii.ii.i-p36.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028">1Co 15:28</a><a name="vii.ii.i-p36.1"></A>,) and in the same sense they take this passage. But such a delirium as this never entered the minds of the holy Apostles; they only intended to say that when divested of all the vices of the flesh, we shall be partakers 				of divine and blessed immortality and glory, so as to be as it were one with God as far as our capacities will allow.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p37"></A>This doctrine was not altogether unknown to Plato, who everywhere defines the chief good of man to be an entire conformity to God; but as he was involved in the mists of errors, he afterwards glided off to his own inventions. But we, disregarding empty speculations, ought to be satisfied with this one thing, &#8212; that the image of God in holiness and righteousness is restored to us for this end, that we may at length be partakers of eternal 				life and glory as far as it will be necessary for our complete felicity.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.i-p38"></A><i>Having escaped</i>  We have already explained that the design of the Apostle was, to set before us the dignity of the glory of heaven, to which God invites us, and thus to draw us away from the vanity of this world. Moreover, he sets the corruption of the world in opposition to the divine nature; but he shews that this corruption is 				not in the elements which surround us, but in our heart, because there vicious and depraved affections prevail, the fountain and root of which he points out by the word <i>lust.</i> Corruption, then, is thus placed in the world, that we may know that the world is in us.</p>  <a name="vii.ii.ii"></A>

<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p11"></A><b>9. </b>Cui enim Haec non adsunt, caecus est, manu palpans, purgationis oblitus veterum delictorum.</p>

<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p14"></A><b>5</b>  <i>And besides this. </i>As it is a work arduous and of immense labor, to put off the corruption which is in us, he bids us to strive and make every effort for this purpose. He intimates that no place is to be given in this case to sloth, and that we ought to obey God calling us, 				not slowly or carelessly, but that there is need of alacrity; as though he had said, &#8220;Put forth every effort, and make your exertions manifest to all.&#8221; &#8212; For this is what the participle he uses imports.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p15"></A><i>Add to your faith virtue,</i> or, <i>Supply to your faith virtue</i>. He shews for what purpose the faithful were to strive, that is, that they might have faith adorned with good morals, wisdom, patience, and love. Then he intimates that faith ought not to be naked or empty, but that these are its inseparable 				companions. To supply to faith, is to add to faith. There is not here, however, properly a gradation as to the sense, though it appears as to the words; for love does not in order follow patience, nor does it proceed from it. Therefore the passage is to be thus simply explained, &#8220;Strive that virtue, prudence, temperance, and the things which follow, may be added to your faith.&#8221;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_148"><FONT SIZE="1">149</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p17"></A>I take <i>virtue</i> to mean a life honest and rightly formed; for it is not here <a name="vii.ii.ii-p17.1"></A>&#7952;&#957;&#8051;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;, energy or courage, but <a name="vii.ii.ii-p17.2"></A>&#7936;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#8052;, virtue, moral goodness. Knowledge is what is necessary for 				acting prudently; for after having put down a general term, he mentions some of the principal endowments of a Christian. <i>Brotherly-kindness,</i> <a name="vii.ii.ii-p17.3"></A>&#966;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#8055;&#945;, is mutual affection among the children of God. Love extends wider, because it embraces all mankind.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p18"></A>It may, however, be here asked, whether Peter, by assigning to us the work of supplying or adding virtue, thus far extolled the strength and power of free-will? They who seek to establish free-will in man, indeed concede to God the first place, that is, that he begins to act or work in us; but they imagine that we at the same time co-operate, and that it is thus owing to us that the movements of God are not rendered void and 				inefficacious. But the perpetual doctrine of Scripture is opposed to this delirious notion: for it plainly testifies, that right feelings are formed in us by God, and are rendered by him effectual. It testifies also that all our progress and perseverance are from God. Besides, it expressly declares that wisdom, love, patience, are the gifts of God and the Spirit. When, therefore, the Apostle requires these things, he by no means asserts that they are in our power, but only shews what we ought 				to have, and what ought to be done. And as to the godly, when conscious of their own infirmity, they find themselves deficient in their duty, nothing remains for them but to flee to God for aid and help.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">150</FONT></A>

<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p21"></A><b>8.</b> <i>For if these things be in you.</i> Then, he says, you will at length prove that Christ is really known by you, if ye be endued with virtue, temperance, and the other endowments. For the knowledge of Christ is an efficacious thing and a living root, which brings forth fruit. For by saying that these 				things would make them <i>neither barren nor unfruitful, </i>he shews that all those glory, in vain and falsely, that they have the knowledge of Christ, who boast of it without love, patience, and the like gifts, as Paul also says in <a name="vii.ii.ii-p21.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#020">Eph 4:20</a><a name="vii.ii.ii-p21.1"></A>,</p>  			 
<p class="Center"><a name="vii.ii.ii-p22"></A>&#8220;Ye have not so learned Christ, if so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus, that ye put off the old man,&#8221; etc.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p23"></A>For he means that those who possess Christ without newness of life, have never been rightly taught his doctrine.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p24"></A>But he would not have the faithful to be only taught patience, godliness, temperance, love; but he requires a continual progress to be made as to these endowments, and that justly, for we are as yet far off from the goal. We ought, therefore, always to make advances, so that God&#8217;s gifts may continually increase in us.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.ii.ii-p25"></A><a name="vii.ii.ii-p25.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p26"></A><b>9.</b> <i>But he that lacketh these things.</i> He now expresses more clearly that they who profess a naked faith are wholly without any true knowledge. He then says that they go astray like the blind in darkness, because they do not see the right way which is shewn to us by the light of 				the gospel.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_150"></A><A HREF="#fn_150"><FONT SIZE="1">151</FONT></A>
 				 This he also confirms by adding this reason, because such have forgotten that through the benefit of Christ they had been cleansed from sin, and yet this is the beginning of our Christianity. It then follows, that those who do not strive for a pure and holy life, do not understand even the first rudiments of faith.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.ii-p28"></A>But Peter takes this for granted, that they who were still rolling in the filth of the flesh had forgotten their own purgation. For the blood of Christ has not become a washing bath to us, that it may be fouled by our filth. He, therefore, calls them old sins, by which he means, that our life ought to be otherwise formed, because we have been cleansed from our sins; not that any one can be pure from every sin while he lives in this 				world, or that the cleansing we obtain through Christ consists of pardon only, but that we ought to differ from the unbelieving, as God has separated us for himself. Though, then, we daily sin, and God daily forgives us, and the blood of Christ cleanses us from our sins, yet sin ought not to rule in us, but the sanctification of the Spirit ought to prevail in us; for so Paul teaches us in <a name="vii.ii.ii-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011">1Co 6:11</a><a name="vii.ii.ii-p28.1"></A>, &#8220;And such were some of you; but ye are washed,&#8221; <i>etc.</i></p>  <a name="vii.ii.iii"></A>

<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p16"></A><b>10.</b> <i>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence.</i> He draws this conclusion, that it is one proof that we have been really elected, and not in vain called by the Lord, if a good conscience and integrity of life correspond with our profession of faith. And he infers, that there ought to be more labor 				and diligence, because he had said before, that faith ought not to be barren.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p17"></A>Some copies have, &#8220;by good works;&#8221; but these words make no change in the sense, for they are to be understood though not expressed.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_151"></A><A HREF="#fn_151"><FONT SIZE="1">152</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p19"></A>He mentions <i>calling</i> first, though the last in order. The reason is, because election is of greater weight or importance; and it is a right arrangement of a sentence to subjoin what preponderates. The meaning then is, labor that you may have it really proved that you have not been called nor elected in vain. At the same time 				he speaks here of calling as the effect and evidence of election. If any one prefers to regard the two words as meaning the same thing, I do not object; for the Scripture sometimes merges the difference which exists between two terms. I have, however, stated what seems to me more probable.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_152"></A><A HREF="#fn_152"><FONT SIZE="1">153</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p21"></A>Now a question arises, Whether the stability of our calling and election depends on good works, for if it be so, it follows that it depends on us. But the whole Scripture teaches us, first, that God's election is founded on his eternal purpose; and secondly, that calling begins and is completed through his gratuitous goodness. The Sophists, in order to transfer what is peculiar to God's grace to ourselves, usually pervert this evidence. 				But their evasions may be easily refuted. For if any one thinks that calling is rendered sure by men, there is nothing absurd in that; we may however, go still farther, that every one confirms his calling by leading a holy and pious life. But it is very foolish to infer from this what the Sophists contend for; for this is a proof not taken from the cause, but on the contrary from the sign or the effect. Moreover, this does not prevent election from being gratuitous, nor does it shew that it is 				in our own hand or power to confirm election. For the matter stands thus, &#8212; God effectually calls whom he has preordained to life in his secret counsel before the foundation of the world; and he also carries on the perpetual course of calling through grace alone. But as he has chosen us, and calls us for this end, that we may be pure and spotless in his presence; purity of life is not improperly called the evidence and proof of election, by which the faithful may not only testify to others that 				they are the children of God, but also confirm themselves in this confidence, in such a manner, however, that they fix their solid foundation on something else.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p22"></A>At the same time, this certainty, mentioned by Peter, ought, I think, to be referred to the conscience, as though the faithful acknowledged themselves before God to be chosen and called. But I take it simply of the fact itself, that calling appears as confirmed by this very holiness of life. It may, indeed, be rendered, Labor that your calling may become certain; for the verb <a name="vii.ii.iii-p22.1"></A>&#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; is transitive or intransitive. Still, however you may render it, the meaning is nearly the same.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p23"></A>The import of what is said is, that the children of God are distinguished from the reprobate by this mark, that they live a godly and a holy life, because this is the design and end of election. Hence it is evident how wickedly some vile unprincipled men prattle, when they seek to make gratuitous election an excuse for all licentiousness; as though, forsooth! we may sin with impunity, because we have been predestinated to righteousness 				and holiness!</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p24"></A><i>For if ye do these things.</i> Peter seems again to ascribe to the merits of works, that God furthers our salvation, and also that we continually persevere in his grace. But the explanation is obvious; for his purpose was only to shew that hypocrites have in them nothing real or solid, and that, on the contrary, they who prove their calling sure by good 				works, are free from the danger of falling, because sure and sufficient is the grace of God by which they are supported. Thus the certainty of our salvation by no means depends on us, as doubtless the cause of it is beyond our limits. But with regard to those who feel in themselves the efficacious working of the Spirit, Peter bids them to take courage as to the future, because the Lord has laid in them the solid foundation of a true and sure calling.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.ii.iii-p25"></A><a name="vii.ii.iii-p25.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p26"></A>He explains the way or means of persevering, when he says, <i>an entrance shall be ministered to you.</i> The import of the words is this: &#8220;God, by ever supplying you abundantly with new graces, will lead you to his own kingdom.&#8221; And this was added, that we may know, that though we have already passed from death into life, yet it is 				a passage of hope; and as to the fruition of life, there remains for us yet a long journey. In the meantime we are not destitute of necessary helps. Hence Peter obviates a doubt by these words, &#8220;The Lord will abundantly supply your need, until you shall enter into his eternal kingdom.&#8221; He calls it the <i>kingdom of Christ,</i> because we cannot ascend to heaven except under his banner and 				guidance.</p>

<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p28"></A><b>12.</b> <i>Wherefore I will not be negligent</i>. As we seem to distrust either the memory or the attention of those whom we often remind of the same thing, the Apostle makes this modest excuse, that he ceased not to press on the attention of the faithful what was well known and fixed in their minds, because its 				importance and greatness required this.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p29"></A>&#8220;Ye do, indeed,&#8221; he says, &#8220;fully understand what the truth of the gospel is, nor have I to confirm as it were the wavering, but in a matter so great, admonitions are never superfluous; and, therefore, they ought never to be deemed vexatious.&#8221; Paul also employs a similar excuse in <a name="vii.ii.iii-p29.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#014">Ro 15:14</a><a name="vii.ii.iii-p29.1"></A>,</p>  			 
<p class="Center"><a name="vii.ii.iii-p30"></A>&#8220;I am persuaded of you, brethren,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that ye are full of knowledge, so as to be able to admonish one another: but I have more confidently written to you, as putting you in mind.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p31"></A>He calls that <i>the present truth</i>, into the possession of which they had already entered by a sure faith. He, then, commends their faith, in order that they might remain fixed in it more firmly.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.ii.iii-p32"></A><a name="vii.ii.iii-p32.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p33"></A><b>13.</b> <i>Yea, I think it meet,</i> or <i>right</i>. He expresses more clearly how useful and how necessary is admonition, because it is needful to arouse the faithful, for otherwise torpor will creep in from the flesh. Though, then, they might not have wanted 				teaching, yet he says that the goads of admonitions were useful, lest security and indulgence (as it is usually the case) should weaken what they had learned, and at length extinguish it.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p34"></A>He adds another cause why he was so intent on writing to them, because he knew that a short time remained for him. &#8220;I must diligently employ my time,&#8221; he says; &#8220;for the Lord has made known to me that my life in this world will not be long.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p35"></A>We hence learn, that admonitions ought to be so given, that the people whom we wish to benefit may not think that wrong is done to them, and also that offenses ought to be so avoided, that yet the truth may have a free course, and exhortations may not be discontinued. Now, this moderation is to be observed towards those to whom a sharp reproof would not be suitable, but who ought on the contrary to be kindly helped, since they are 				inclined of themselves to do their duty. We are also taught by the example of Peter, that the shorter term of life remains to us, the more diligent ought we to be in executing our office. It is not commonly given to us to foresee our end; but they who are advanced in years, or weakened by illness, being reminded by such indications of the shortness of their life, ought to be more sedulous and diligent, so that they may in due time perform what the Lord has given them to do; nay, those who are 				the strongest and in the flower of their age, as they do not render to God so constant a service as it behooves them to do, ought to quicken themselves to the same care and diligence by the recollection of approaching death; lest the occasion of doing good may pass away, while they attend negligently and slothfully to their work.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p36"></A>At the same time, I doubt not but that it was Peter&#8217;s object to gain more authority and weight to his teaching, when he said that he would endeavor to make them to remember these things after his death, which was then nigh at hand. For when any one, shortly before he quits this life, addresses us, his words have in a manner the force and power of a testament or will, and are usually received by us with greater reverence.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.ii.iii-p37"></A><a name="vii.ii.iii-p37.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p38"></A><b>14</b>  <i>I must put off this my tabernacle.</i> Literally the words are, &#8220;Short is the putting; away of this tabernacle.&#8221; By this mode of speaking, and afterwards by the word &#8220;departing,&#8221; he designates death, which it behooves us to notice; for we are here taught how much death differs 				from perdition. Besides, too much dread of death terrifies us, because we do not sufficiently consider how fading and evanescent this life is, and do not reflect on the perpetuity of future life. But what does Peter say? He declares that death is departing from this world, that we may remove elsewhere, even to the Lord. It ought not, then, to be dreadful to us, as though we were to perish when we die. He declares that it is the putting away of a tabernacle, by which we are covered only for a 				short time. There is, then, no reason why we should regret to be removed from it.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p39"></A>But there is to be understood an implied contrast between a fading tabernacle and a perpetual habitation, which Paul explains in <a name="vii.ii.iii-p39.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001">2Co 5:1</a><a name="vii.ii.iii-p39.1"></A>.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_153"></A><A HREF="#fn_153"><FONT SIZE="1">154</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iii-p41"></A>When he says that <i>it had been revealed to him by Christ</i>, he refers not to the kind of death, but to the time.

It certainly appears that he died very far from Italy, except he flew in a moment over seas and lands.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_154"></A><A HREF="#fn_154"><FONT SIZE="1">155</FONT></A>
 				But the Papists, in order to claim for themselves the body of Peter, make themselves Babylonians, and say that Rome is called Babylon by Peter: this shall be refuted in its proper place. What he says of remembering these things after his death, was intended to shew, that posterity ought to learn from him when dead. For the apostles had not regard only for their own age, but purposed to do us good also. Though, then, they are dead, their doctrine lives and prevails: and it is our 				duty to profit by their writings, as though they were manifestly present with. us.</p>  <a name="vii.ii.iv"></A>

<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p10"></A><b>16. </b><i>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables.</i> It gives us much courage, when we know that we labor in a matter that is certain. Lest, then, the faithful should think that in these labors they were beating the air, he now comes to set forth the certainty of the gospel; and he denies that anything had been delivered by 				him but what was altogether true and indubitable: and they were encouraged to persevere, when they were sure of the prosperous issue of their calling.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p11"></A>In the first place, Peter indeed asserts that he had been an eyewitness; for he had himself seen with his own eyes the glory of Christ, of which he speaks. This knowledge he sets in opposition to crafty fables, such as cunning men are wont to fabricate to ensnare simple minds. The old interpreter renders the word &#8220;feigned,&#8221; (<a name="vii.ii.iv-p11.1"></A><i>fictas</i>;) Erasmus, &#8220;formed by art.&#8221; It seems to me that <i>what is subtle to deceive</i> is meant: for the Greek word here used, <a name="vii.ii.iv-p11.2"></A>&#963;&#959;&#966;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;, sometimes means this. And we know how much labor men bestow on frivolous refinements, and only that they may have some amusement. Therefore no less seriously ought our 				minds to be applied to know the truth which is not fallacious, and the doctrine which is not nugatory, and which discovers to us the glory of the Son of God and our own salvation.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_155"></A><A HREF="#fn_155"><FONT SIZE="1">156</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p13"></A><i>The power and the coming. </i>No doubt he meant in these words to include the substance of the gospel, as it certainly contains nothing except Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom. But he distinctly mentions two things, &#8212; that Christ had been manifested in the flesh, &#8212; and also that power was exhibited by him.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_156"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">157</FONT></A>
 				 Thus, then, we have the whole gospel; for we know that he, the long-promised Redeemer, came from heaven, put on our flesh, lived in the world, died and rose again; and, in the second place, we perceive the end and fruit of all these things, that is, that he might be God with us, that he might exhibit in himself a sure pledge of our adoption, that he might cleanse us from the defilement&#8217;s of the flesh by the grace of his Spirit, and consecrate us temples to God, 				that he might deliver us from hell, and raise us up to heaven, that he might by the sacrifice of his death make an atonement for the sins of the world, that he might reconcile us to the Father, that he might become to us the author of righteousness and of life. He who knows and understands these things, is fully acquainted with the gospel.</p>

 				 We hence conclude, that they by no means serve Christ, nor are like the apostles, who presumptuously mount the pulpit to prattle of speculations unknown to themselves; for he alone is the lawful minister of Christ, who knows the truth of the doctrine which he delivers: not that all obtain certainty in the same way; for what Peter says is that he himself was present, when Christ was declared by a voice from heaven to be the Son of God. Three only were then present, 				but they were sufficient as witnesses; for they had through many miracles seen the glory of Christ, and had a remarkable evidence of his divinity in his resurrection. But we now obtain certainty in another way; for though Christ has not risen before our eyes, yet we know by whom his resurrection has been handed down to us. And added to this is the inward testimony of conscience, the sealing of the Spirit, which far exceeds all the evidence of the senses. But let us remember that the gospel was 				not at the beginning made up of vague rumors, but that the apostles were the authentic preachers of what they had seen.</p>

<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p18"></A><b>17.</b> <i>For he received from God the Father.</i> He chose one memorable example out of many, even that of Christ, when, adorned with celestial glory, he conspicuously displayed his divine majesty to his three disciples. And though Peter does not relate all the circumstances, yet he sufficiently designates them 				when he says, <i>that a voice came from the magnificent glory.</i> For the meaning is, that nothing earthly was seen there, but that a celestial majesty shone on every side. We may hence conclude what those displays of greatness were which the evangelists relate. And it was necessarily thus done, in order that the authority of that voice which came might be more awful and solemn, as we see that it was done 				all at once by the Lord. For when he spoke to the fathers, he did not only cause his words to sound in the air, but by adding some symbols or tokens of his presence, he proved the oracles to be his.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p19"></A><i>This is my beloved Son.</i> Peter then mentions this voice, as though it was sufficient alone, as a full evidence for the gospel, and justly so. For when Christ is acknowledged by us to be him whom the Father has sent, this is our highest wisdom. There are two parts to this sentence. When he says, &#8220;This is,&#8221; the expression is very emphatical, intimating, 				that he was the Messiah who had been so often promised. Whatever, then, is found in the Law and the Prophets respecting the Messiah, is declared here, by the Father, to belong to him whom he so highly commended. In the other part of the sentence, he announces Christ as his own Son, in whom his whole love dwells and centres. It hence follows that we are not otherwise loved than in him, nor ought the love of God to be sought anywhere else. It is sufficient for me now only to touch on these things 				by the way.</p>

<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p10"></A><b>19.</b> <i>We have also. </i>He now shews that the truth of the gospel is founded on the oracles of the prophets, lest they who embraced it should hesitate to devote themselves wholly to Christ: for they who waver cannot be otherwise than remiss in their minds. But when he says, &#8220;We have,&#8221; he refers to himself and 				other teachers, as well as to their disciples. The apostles had the prophets as the patrons of their doctrine; the faithful also sought from them a confirmation of the gospel. I am the more disposed to take this view, because he speaks of the whole Church, and makes himself one among others. At the same time, he refers more especially to the Jews, who were well acquainted with the doctrine of the prophets. And hence, as I think, he calls their word <i>more sure</i> or <i>firmer</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p11"></A>For they who take the comparative for a positive, that is, &#8220;more sure,&#8221; for &#8220;sure,&#8221; do not sufficiently consider the whole context. The sense also is a forced one, when it is said to be &#8220;more sure,&#8221; because God really completed what he had promised concerning his Son. For the truth of the gospel is here simply proved by a twofold testimony, &#8212; that Christ had been highly approved by the solemn declaration of God, and, then, that all the 				prophecies of the prophets confirmed the same thing. But it appears at first sight strange, that the word of the prophets should be said to be more sure or firmer than the voice which came from the holy mouth of God himself; for, first, the authority of God's word is the same from the beginning; and, secondly, it was more confirmed than previously by the coming of Christ. But the solution of this knot is not difficult: for here the Apostle had a regard to his own nation, who were acquainted 				with the prophets, and their doctrine was received without any dispute. As, then, it was not doubted by the Jews but that all the things which the prophets had taught, came from the Lord, it is no wonder that Peter said that their word was more sure. Antiquity also gains some reverence. There are, besides, some other circumstances which ought to be noticed; particularly, that no suspicion could be entertained as to those prophecies in which the kingdom of Christ had so long before been 				predicted.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p12"></A>The question, then, is not here, whether the prophets deserve more credit than the gospel; but Peter regarded only this, to shew how much deference the Jews paid to those who counted the prophets as God's faithful ministers, and had been brought up from childhood in their school.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">159</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p15"></A><i>Whereunto ye do well.</i> This passage is, indeed, attended with some more difficulty; for it may be asked, what is the day which Peter mentions? To some it seems to be the clear knowledge of Christ, when men fully acquiesce in the gospel; and the <i>darkness</i> they explain as existing, when they, as yet, hesitate 				in suspense, and the doctrine of the gospel is not received as indubitable; as though Peter praised those Jews who were searching for Christ in the Law and the Prophets, and were advancing, as by this preceding light towards Christ, the Sun of righteousness, as they were praised by Luke, who, having heard Paul preaching, searched the Scripture to know whether what he said was true. (<a name="vii.ii.v-p15.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011">Ac 17:11</a><a name="vii.ii.v-p15.1"></A>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p16"></A>But in this view there is, first, an inconsistency, because it thus seems that the use of the prophecies is confined to a short time, as though they would be superfluous when the gospel-light is seen. Were one to object and say, that this does not necessarily follow, because <i>until</i> does not always denote the end. To this I say, that in commands it cannot be otherwise taken: &#8220;Walk until you finish your course;&#8221; &#8220;Fight until you 				conquer.&#8221; In such expressions we doubtless see that a certain time is specified.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">160</FONT></A>
 				But were I to concede this point, that the reading of the prophets is not thus wholly cast aside; yet every one must see how frigid is this commendation, that the prophets are useful until Christ is revealed to us; for their teaching is necessary to us until the end of life. Secondly, we must bear in mind who they were whom Peter addressed; for he was not instructing the ignorant and novices, who were as yet in the first rudiments; but even those respecting whom he had before 				testified, that they had obtained the same precious faith, and were confirmed in the present truth. Surely the gross darkness of ignorance could not have been ascribed to such people. I know what some allege, that all had not made the same progress, and that here beginners who were as yet seeking Christ, are admonished.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p18"></A>But as it is evident from the context, that the words were addressed to the same persons, the passage must necessarily be applied to the faithful who had already known Christ, and had become partakers of the true light. I therefore extend this darkness, mentioned by Peter, to the whole course of life, and <i>the day,</i> I consider will then <i>shine</i> on us when we shall see face to face, what we now see through a glass darkly. Christ, 				the Sun of righteousness, indeed, shines forth in the gospel; but the darkness of death will always, in part, possess our minds, until we shall be brought out of the prison of the flesh, and be translated into heaven. This, then, will be the brightness of day, when no clouds or mists of ignorance shall intercept the bright shining of the Sun.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p19"></A>And doubtless we are so far from a perfect day, as our faith is from perfection. It is, therefore, no wonder that the state of the present life is called darkness, since we are far distant from that knowledge to which the gospel invites us.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">161</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p21"></A>In short, Peter reminds us that as long as we sojourn in this world, we have need of the doctrine of the prophets as a guiding light; which being extinguished, we can do nothing else but wander in darkness; for he does not disjoin the prophecies from the gospel, when he teaches us that they shine to shew us the way. His object only was to teach us that the whole course of our life ought to be guided by God's word; for otherwise we must be 				involved on every side in the darkness of ignorance; and the Lord does not shine on us, except when we take his word as our light.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p22"></A>But he does not use the comparison, <i>light,</i> or lamp, to intimate that the light is small and sparing, but to make these two things to correspond,--that we are without light, and can no more keep on the right way than those who go astray in a dark night; and that the Lord brings a remedy for this evil, when he lights a torch to guide us in the midst of darkness.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p23"></A>What he immediately adds respecting<i> the day star</i> does not however seem altogether suitable to this explanation; for the real knowledge, to which we are advancing through life, cannot be called the beginning of the day. To this I reply, that different parts of the day are compared together, but the whole day in all its parts is 				set in opposition to that darkness, which would wholly overspread all our faculties, were not the Lord to come to our help by the light of his word.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p24"></A>This is a remarkable passage: we learn from it how God guides us. The Papists have ever and anon in their mouth, that the Church cannot err. Though the word is neglected, they yet imagine that it is guided by the Spirit. But Peter, on the contrary, intimates that all are immersed in darkness who do not attend to the light of the word. Therefore, except thou art resolved wilfully to cast thyself into a labyrinth, especially beware of 				departing even in the least thing from the rule and direction of the word. Nay, the Church cannot follow God as its guide, except it observes what the word prescribes.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p25"></A>In this passage Peter also condemns all the wisdom of men, in order that we may learn humbly to seek, otherwise than by our own understanding, the true way of knowledge; for without the word nothing is left for men but darkness.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p26"></A>It further deserves to be noticed, that he pronounces on the clearness of Scripture; for what is said would be a false eulogy, were not the Scripture fit and suitable to shew to us with certainty the right way. Whosoever, then, will open his eyes through the obedience of faith, shall by experience know that the Scripture has not been in vain called a light. It is, indeed, obscure to the unbelieving; but they who are given up to 				destruction are wilfully blind. Execrable, therefore, is the blasphemy of the Papists, who pretend that the light of Scripture does nothing but dazzle the eyes, in order to keep the simple from reading it. But it is no wonder that proud men, inflated with the wind of false confidence, do not see that light with which the Lord favors only little children and the humble. With a similar eulogy David commends the law of God in 				<a name="vii.ii.v-p26.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001">Ps. 19:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#001">Ps. 119:1</a><a name="vii.ii.v-p26.1"></A>.</p>

<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p28"></A><b>20.</b> <i>Knowing this first.</i> Here Peter begins to shew how our minds are to be prepared, if we really wish to make progress in scriptural knowledge. There may at the same time be two interpretations given, if you read <a name="vii.ii.v-p28.1"></A>&#7952;&#960;&#951;&#955;&#8059;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; as some do, which means <i>occurrence</i>, <i>impulse</i>; or, as I have rendered it, <i>interpretation</i>, <a name="vii.ii.v-p28.2"></A>&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#955;&#8059;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;. But almost all give this meaning, that we ought not to rush on headlong and rashly when we 				read Scripture, confiding in our own understanding. They think that a confirmation of this follows, because the Spirit, who spoke by the prophets, is the only true interpreter of himself.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p29"></A>This explanation contains a true, godly, and useful doctrine, that then only are the prophecies read profitably, when we renounce the mind and feelings of the flesh, and submit to the teaching of the Spirit, but that it is an impious profanation of it; when we arrogantly rely on our own acumen, deeming that sufficient to enable us to understand it, though the mysteries contain things hidden to our flesh, and sublime treasures of life far 				surpassing our capacities. And this is what we have said, that the light which shines in it, comes to the humble alone.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p30"></A>But the Papists are doubly foolish, when they conclude from this passage, that no interpretation of a private man ought to be deemed authoritative. For they pervert what Peter says, that they may claim for their own councils the chief right of interpreting Scripture; but in this they act indeed childishly; for Peter calls interpretation <i>private,</i> not that of every individual, in order to prohibit each one to interpret; but he shews 				that whatever men bring of their own is profane. Were, then, the whole world unanimous, and were the minds of all men united together, still what would proceed from them, would be private or their own; for the word is here set in opposition to divine revelation; so that the faithful, inwardly illuminated by the Holy Spirit, acknowledge nothing but what God says in his word.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p31"></A>However, another sense seems to me more simple, that Peter says that Scripture came not from man, or through the suggestions of man. For thou wilt never come well prepared to read it, except thou bringest reverence, obedience, and docility; but a just reverence then only exists when we are convinced that God speaks to us, and not mortal men. Then Peter especially bids us to believe the prophecies as the indubitable oracles of God, because 				they have not emanated from men's own private suggestions.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">162</FONT></A>

<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p37"></A><i>But holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</i> They did not of themselves, or according to their own will, foolishly deliver their own inventions. The meaning is, that the beginning of right knowledge is to give that credit to the holy prophets which is due to God. He calls them the <i>holy 				men of God,</i> because they faithfully executed the office committed to them, having sustained the person of God in their ministrations. He says that they were &#8212; not that they were bereaved of mind, (as the Gentiles imagined their prophets to have been,) but because they dared not to announce anything of their own, and obediently followed the Spirit as their guide, who ruled in their mouth as in his own sanctuary. Understand by <i>prophecy of 				Scripture</i> that which is contained in the holy Scriptures.</p>

The question of free-will ought to be confined to conversion, and not extended to the state of those who have been converted. The tenth article of the Church of England nearly meets the question, yet not wholly: it ascribes the will to turn most distinctly to 					 God, and says that man cannot turn himself; but it does not expressly say whether man can resist the good-will given him, which is the very gist of the question. But it says further, that the grace of God by Christ &#8220;worketh with us when we have that good-will,&#8221; which seems certainly to imply, that the good-will first given is made thereby effectual.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="vii.ii.v-p13"></A> Much has been written on this subject; and the difficulty has arisen from a wrong construction of the passage, which is literally as follows: &#8212; &#8220;And we have more firm the prophetic word,&#8221; <a name="vii.ii.v-p13.1"></A>&#922;&#945;&#8054; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957; &#946;&#949;&#946;&#945;&#953;&#8057;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#957;, that is, we have rendered more firm the prophetic word. This is confirmed by what follows; for 					 the prophetic word is compared to &#8220;a light shining in a dark place,&#8221; and, therefore, not clear nor firm until it be fulfilled; but they were doing well to attend to this light until the full light of the gospel shone in their hearts. As<i> Scott</i> maintains, the reference here is clearly to the experience of Christians to their real knowledge of divine truths; for it was to be <i>in</i> their <i>hearts</i>, and not <i>before</i> their <i>eyes</i></p>  				  
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p14"></A>A great deal of learning has been spent to no purpose on this passage. It has been by most taken as granted, that &#8220;the power and coming of our Lord,&#8221; mentioned in verse 16th, is his second coming, when the whole passage refers only and expressly to his first coming. And on this gratuitous and even false supposition is grounded the elaborate exposition of <i>Sherlock, Horsley</i>, and others. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="vii.ii.v-p17"></A> There is no command here: the Apostle only approves of what they were doing, &#8220;whereunto ye do well that ye take heed.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="vii.ii.v-p20"></A> The Apostle does not speak of the perfect day, but of the dawn of it, and the daystar is that which ushers in the perfect day. The gospel is the dawn and the daystar, compared with the glimmering light of prophecy, and compared too with the perfect day of the heavenly kingdom. Prophecy is useful still; for its fulfillment, found in the gospel, greatly strengthens faith. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="vii.ii.v-p32"></A> There are in the main three renderings of this passage: &#8212; l. &#8220;No Prophecy of Scripture is of a private impulse,&#8221; or invention; &#8212; 2. &#8220;No prophecy of Scripture is of self-interpretation,&#8221; that is, is its own interpreter; &#8212; 3. No prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation, that is, is not to be interpreted according to the fancies of men, but according to the word of God and the guidance of his Spirit. Now which of these corresponds with 					 the context? Clearly the first, the two others have nothing in the passage to countenance them. The next verse is evidently explanatory of this sentence, which seems at once to determine its meaning; and, as it is often the case in Scripture, the explanation is given negatively and positively. Prophecy <i>did not</i> come from the will of man; it <i>did</i> come from the Spirit of God. Besides, the importance attached to the announcement, &#8220;knowing this especially,&#8221; is not so clearly borne out 					 as by the first exposition, because the fact that prophecy did not come from man, is everything in the question, while the other expositions contain only things of subordinate importance. Thus what goes before and comes after tends to confirm the same view.</p>  				  
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p33"></A>Whether we take the conjectural reading (which only differs from the other in one small letter) or that which is found in all the MSS., it may admit of the meaning that has been given. There is either an <a name="vii.ii.v-p33.1"></A>&#7952;&#954;, &#8220;from,&#8221; understood, or the word <i>prophecy</i> is to be repeated: &#8220;No 					 prophecy of Scripture is <i>from</i> one's own explanation;&#8221; or, &#8220;No prophecy of Scripture is a <i>prophecy</i> of one's own explanation,&#8221; or interpretation, that is, as to things to come.</p>  				  
<p><a name="vii.ii.v-p34"></A><i>Calvin</i> has been followed in his view of this passage, among others, by <i>Grotius, Doddridge</i>, and <i>Macknight</i>. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>
