<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p2"></A><b>1.</b> This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in <i>both</i> which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p3"></A><b>1. </b>Hane jam, dilecti, secundam vobis scribo epistolam, in quibus excito per commonefactionem vestram puram mentem;</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p4"></A><b>2.</b> That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p5"></A><b>2.</b> Ut memores sitis verborum quae predicta sunt a sanctis prophetis, et praecepti nostri, qui sumus apostoli Domini et Servatoris;</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p6"></A><b>3.</b> Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p7"></A><b>3.</b> Hoc primum scientes, qu&ograve;d venient in extremo dierum illusores, secundum suas ipsorum concupiscentias ambulantes,</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p8"></A><b>4.</b> And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as <i>they were</i> from the beginning of the creation.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p9"></A><b>4.</b> Ac dicentes, Ubi est promissio adventus ejus? Ex quo enim patres dormierunt, omnia sic permanent ab initio creationis.</p>

<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p12"></A><b>1.</b> Lest they should be wearied with the Second Epistle as though the first was sufficient, he says that it was not written in vain, because they stood in need of being often stirred up. To make this more evident, he shews that they could not be beyond danger, except they were well fortified, because they would have to contend with desperate men, who would not only corrupt the purity of the faith, by false opinions, but do what they 				could to subvert entirely the whole faith.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p13"></A>By saying, <i>I stir up your pure mind,</i> he means the same as though he had said, &#8220;I wish to awaken you to a sincerity of mind.&#8221; And the words ought to be thus explained, &#8220;I stir up your mind that it may be pure and bright.&#8221; For the meaning is, that the minds of the godly become dim, and as it were contract rust, when admonitions 				cease. But we also hence learn, that men even endued with learning, become, in a manner, drowsy, except they are stirred up by constant warnings.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">175</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p15"></A>It now appears what is the use of admonitions, and how necessary they are; for the sloth of the flesh smothers the truth once received, and renders it inefficient, except the goads of warnings come to its aid. It is not then enough, that men should be taught to know what they ought to be, but there is need of godly teachers, to do this second part, deeply to impress the truth on the memory of their hearers. And as men are, by nature, for 				the most part, fond of novelty and thus inclined to be fastidious, it is useful for us to bear in mind what Peter says, so that we may not only willingly suffer ourselves to be admonished by others, but that every one may also exercise himself in calling to mind continually the truth, so that our minds may become resplendent with the pure and clear knowledge of it.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iv.i-p16"></A><a name="vii.iv.i-p16.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p17"></A><b>2.</b> <i>That ye may be mindful.</i> By these words he intimates that we have enough in the writings of the prophets, and in the gospel, to stir us up, provided we be as diligent as it behoves us, in meditating on them; and that our minds sometimes contract a rust, or become bedimmed through darkness, is owing to 				our sloth. That God may then continually shine upon us, we must devote ourselves to that study: let our faith at the same time acquiesce in witnesses so certain and credible. For when we have the prophets and apostles agreeing with us, nay, as the ministers of our faith, and God as the author, and angels as approvers, there is no reason that the ungodly, all united, should move us from our position. By the <i>commandment of the 				apostles</i> he means the whole doctrine in which they had instructed the faithful.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">176</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iv.i-p20"></A><a name="vii.iv.i-p20.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p21"></A><b>3.</b> <i>Knowing this first.</i> The participle <i>knowing</i> may be applied to the Apostle, and in this way, &#8220;I labor to stir you up for this reason, because I know what and how great is your impending danger from scoffers.&#8221; I however prefer this explanation, that the 				participle is used in place of a verb, as though he had said, &#8220;Know ye this especially.&#8221; For it was necessary that this should have been foretold, because they might have been shaken, had impious men attacked them suddenly with scoffs of this kind. He therefore wished them to know this, and to feel assured on the subject, that they might be prepared to oppose such men.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p22"></A>But he calls the attention of the faithful again to the doctrine which he touched upon in the second chapter. For by <i>the last days</i> is commonly meant the kingdom of Christ, or the days of his kingdom, according to what Paul says, &#8220;Upon whom the ends of the world are come.&#8221; (<a name="vii.iv.i-p22.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011">1Co 10:11</a><a name="vii.iv.i-p22.1"></A>.)   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">177</FONT></A>
 				 The meaning is, that the more God offers himself by the gospel to the world, and the more he invites men to his kingdom, the more audacious on the other hand will ungodly men vomit forth the poison of their impiety.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p24"></A>He calls those <i>scoffers,</i> according to what is usual in Scripture, who seek to appear witty by shewing contempt to God, and by a blasphemous presumption. It is, moreover, the very extremity of evil, when men allow themselves to treat the awful name of God with scoffs. Thus, <a name="vii.iv.i-p24.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001">Ps 1:1</a><a name="vii.iv.i-p24.1"></A> speaks of the seat of scoffers. So David, in <a name="vii.iv.i-p24.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#051">Ps 119:51</a><a name="vii.iv.i-p24.2"></A>, complains that he was derided by the proud, because he attended to God&#8217;s law. So Isaiah, in <a name="vii.iv.i-p24.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#014">Isa 28:14-15</a><a name="vii.iv.i-p24.3"></A>, having 				referred to them, describes their supine security and insensibility. Let us therefore bear in mind, that there is nothing to be feared more than a contest with scoffers. On this subject we said something while explaining the third chapter of the Epistle to the Galatians. As, however, the Holy Scripture has foretold that they would come, and has also given us a shield by which we may defend ourselves, there is no excuse why we should not boldly resist them whatever devices they may 				employ.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iv.i-p25"></A><a name="vii.iv.i-p25.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p26"></A><b>4.</b> <i>Where is the promise. </i>It was a dangerous scoff when they insinuated a doubt as to the last resurrection; for when that is taken away, there is no gospel any longer, the power of Christ is brought to nothing, the whole of religion is gone. Then Satan aims directly at the throat of the Church, when he 				destroys faith in the coming of Christ. For why did Christ die and rise again, except that he may some time gather to himself the redeemed from death, and give them eternal life? All religion is wholly subverted, except faith in the resurrection remains firm and immovable. Hence, on this point Satan assails us most fiercely.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p27"></A>But let us notice what the scoff was. They set the regular course of nature, such as it seems to have been from the beginning, in opposition to the promise of God, as though these things were contrary, or did not harmonize together. Though the faith of the fathers, they said, was the same, yet no change has taken place since their death, and it is known that many ages have passed away. Hence they concluded that what was said of the 				destruction of the world was a fable; because they conjectured, that as it had lasted so long, it would be perpetual.</p>  <a name="vii.iv.ii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption16"><a name="vii.iv.ii-p1"></A><a name="vii.iv.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005">2 Peter 3:5-8</a><a name="vii.iv.ii-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p2"></A><b>5.</b> For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p3"></A><b>5.</b> Nam hoe nesciunt volentes. qu&ograve;d caeli jam olim fuerint, et terra ex aqua, et per aquam consistens, Dei sermone;</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p4"></A><b>6. </b>Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p5"></A><b>6.</b> Per quae mundus qui tunc erat, aqua inundatus periit:</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p6"></A><b>7.</b> But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p7"></A><b>7.</b> Qui autem nunc sunt coeli et terra, ejusdem sermone repositi sunt, et servantur igni in diem judicii et perditionis impiorum.</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p8"></A><b>8.</b> But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day <i>is</i> with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p9"></A><b>8.</b> Porri, ne hoc unum nos lateat, dilecti, qu&ograve;d unus dies apud Dominum perinde est ut mille anni, et mille anni ut dies unus.</p>

<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p12"></A><b>5.</b> <i>For this they willingly are ignorant of.</i> By one argument only he confutes the scoff of the ungodly, even by this, that the world once perished by a deluge of waters, when yet it consisted of waters. (<a name="vii.iv.ii-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002">Ge 1:2</a><a name="vii.iv.ii-p12.1"></A>.) And as the history of this was well known, he says that they <i>willingly,</i> or of their own accord, erred. For they who infer the perpetuity of the world from its present state, designedly close their eyes, so as not to see so clear a judgment of God. The world no doubt had its origin from waters, for Moses calls the chaos from which the earth emerged, waters; and further, it was sustained by waters; it yet pleased 				the Lord to use waters for the purpose of destroying it. It hence appears that the power of nature is not sufficient to sustain and preserve the world, but that on the contrary it contains the very element of its own ruin, whenever it may please God to destroy it.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p13"></A>For it ought always to be borne in mind, that the world stands through no other power than that of God's word, and that therefore inferior or secondary causes derive from him their power, and produce different effects as they are directed. Thus through water the world stood, but water could have done nothing of itself, but on the contrary obeyed God's word as an inferior agent or element. As soon then as it pleased God to destroy the 				earth, the same water obeyed in becoming a ruinous inundation. We now see how egregiously they err, who stop at naked elements, as though there was perpetuity in them, and their nature were not changeable according to the bidding of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p14"></A>By these few words the petulance of those is abundantly refuted, who arm themselves with physical reasons to fight against God. For the history of the deluge is an abundantly sufficient witness that the whole order of nature is governed by the sole power of God. (<a name="vii.iv.ii-p14.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#017">Ge 7:17</a><a name="vii.iv.ii-p14.1"></A>.)</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iv.ii-p15"></A><a name="vii.iv.ii-p15.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p16"></A>It seems, however, strange that he says that the world perished through the deluge, when he had before mentioned the heaven and the earth. To this I answer, that the heaven was then also submerged, that is, the region of the air, which stood open between the two waters. For the division or separation, mentioned by Moses, was then confounded. (<a name="vii.iv.ii-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#006">Ge 1:6</a><a name="vii.iv.ii-p16.1"></A>;) and the word <i>heaven</i> is often taken in this sense. if any wishes for more on this subject, let him read Augustine on the City of God. <i>Lib</i>. 20.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_177"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">178</FONT></A>

<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p23"></A><b>7.</b> <i>But the heavens and the earth which are now.</i> He does not infer this as the consequence; for his purpose was no other than to dissipate the craftiness of scoffers respecting the perpetual state of nature, and we see many such at this day who being slightly embued with the rudiments of philosophy, only 				hunt after profane speculations, in order that they may pass themselves off as great philosophers.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p24"></A>But it now appears quite evident from what has been said, that there is nothing unreasonable in the declaration made by the Lord, that the heaven and the earth shall hereafter be consumed by fire, because the reason for the fire is the same as that for the water. For it was a common saying even among the ancients, that from these two chief elements all things have proceeded. But as he had to do with the ungodly, he speaks expressly of 				their destruction.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iv.ii-p25"></A><a name="vii.iv.ii-p25.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p26"></A><b>8.</b> <i>But be not ignorant of this one thing.</i> He now turns to speak to the godly; and he reminds them that when the coming of Christ is the subject, they were to raise upwards their eyes, for by so doing, they would not limit, by their unreasonable wishes, the time appointed by the Lord. For waiting seems 				very long on this account, because we have our eyes fixed on the shortness of the present life, and we also increase weariness by computing days, hours, and minutes. But when the eternity of God's kingdom comes to our minds, many ages vanish away like so many moments.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p27"></A>This then is what the Apostle calls our attention to, so that we may know that the day of resurrection does not depend on the present flow of time, but on the hidden purpose of God, as though he had said, &#8220;Men wish to anticipate God for this reason, because they measure time according to the judgment of their own flesh; and they are by nature inclined to impatience, so that celerity is even delay to them: do ye then ascend in your minds 				to heaven, and thus time will be to you neither long nor short.&#8221;</p>  <a name="vii.iv.iii"></A>

<p><a name="vii.iv.iii-p2"></A><b>9.</b> The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.iii-p3"></A><b>9.</b> Non tardat Dominus in promissione, sicuti quidam tarditatem slackness; existimant; sed tolerantem se praebet erga nos, nolens ullos perire, sed omnes ad poenitentiam recipere (<i>aut, colligi, vel, aggregari.</i>)</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.iii-p4"></A><b>10.</b> But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.iii-p5"></A><b>10.</b> Veniet autem dies Domini tanquam fur in nocte, in qua coeli in modum procellae transibunt, elementa autem ardore solventur; et terra, quaeque in ea sunt opera ardebunt.</p>

<p><a name="vii.iv.iii-p14"></A><b>9.</b> <i>But the Lord is not slack,</i> or, <i>delays not</i>. He checks extreme and unreasonable haste by another reason, that is, that the Lord defers his coming that he might invite all mankind to repentance. For our minds are always prurient, and a doubt often 				creeps in, why he does not come sooner. But when we hear that the Lord, in delaying, shews a concern for our salvation, and that he defers the time because he has a care for us, there is no reason why we should any longer complain of tardiness. He is tardy who allows an occasion to pass by through slothfulness: there is nothing like this in God, who in the best manner regulates time to promote our salvation. And as to the duration of the whole world, we must think exactly the same as of the 				life of every individual; for God by prolonging time to each, sustains him that he may repent. In the like manner he does not hasten the end of the world, in order to give to all time to repent.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iii-p15"></A>This is a very necessary admonition, so that we may learn to employ time aright, as we shall otherwise suffer a just punishment for our idleness.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iii-p16"></A><i>Not willing that any should perish.</i> So wonderful is his love towards mankind, that he would have them all to be saved, and is of his own self prepared to bestow salvation on the lost. But the order is to be noticed, that God is ready to receive all to repentance, so that none may perish; for in these words the way and manner of obtaining salvation is 				pointed out. Every one of us, therefore, who is desirous of salvation, must learn to enter in by this way.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iii-p17"></A>But it may be asked, If God wishes none to perish, why is it that so many do perish? To this my answer is, that no mention is here made of the hidden purpose of God, according to which the reprobate are doomed to their own ruin, but only of his will as made known to us in the gospel. For God there stretches forth his hand without a difference to all, but lays hold only of those, to lead them to himself, whom he has chosen before the 				foundation of the world.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">179</FONT></A>

<p><a name="vii.iv.iii-p19"></A>But as the verb <a name="vii.iv.iii-p19.1"></A>&#967;&#969;&#961;&#8034;&#963;&#945;&#953; is often taken passively by the Greeks, no less suitable to this passage is the verb which I have put in the margin, that God would have all, who had been before wandering and scattered, to be gathered or come together to repentance.</p>

<p><a name="vii.iv.iii-p21"></A><b>10.</b> <i>But the day of the Lord will come.</i> This has been added, that the faithful might be always watching, and not promise to-morrow to themselves. For we all labor under two very different evils &#8212; too much haste, and slothfulness. We are seized with impatience for the day of Christ already expected; at 				the same time we securely regard it as afar off. As, then, the Apostle has before reproved an unreasonable ardor, so he now shakes off our sleepiness, so that we may attentively expect Christ at all times, lest we should become idle and negligent, as it is usually the case. For whence is it that flesh indulges itself except that there is no thought of the near coming of Christ?</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iii-p22"></A>What afterwards follows, respecting the burning of heaven and earth, requires no long explanation, if indeed we duly consider what is intended. For it was not his purpose to speak refinedly of fire and storm, and other things, but only that he might introduce an exhortation, which he immediately adds, even that we ought to strive after newness of life. For he thus reasons, that as heaven and earth are to be purged by fire, that they may 				correspond with the kingdom of Christ, hence the renovation of men is much more necessary. Mischievous, then, are those interpreters who consume much labor on refined speculations, since the Apostle applies his doctrine to godly exhortations.</p>

He, then, who waits for new heavens, must begin with renewal as to himself, and diligently aspire after it; but they who cleave to their own 				filth, think nothing, it is certain, of God's kingdom, and have no taste for anything but for this corrupt world.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p15"></A>But we must notice that he says, that we ought to be found blameless by Christ; for by these words he intimates, that while the world engages and engrosses the minds of others, we must cast our eyes on the Lord, and he shews at the same time what is real integrity, even that which is approved by his judgment, and not that which gains the Praise of men.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">183</FONT></A>

 				 For as so few turn their attention to the judgment of Christ, hence it is, that while they are carried headlong by their importunate lusts, they are at the same time in a state of disquietude. This peace, then, is the quietness of a peaceable soul, which acquiesces in the word of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p19"></A>It may be asked, how any one can be found blameless by Christ, when we all labor under so many deficiencies. But Peter here only points out the mark at which the faithful ought all to aim, though they cannot reach it, until having put off their flesh they become wholly united to Christ.</p>

<p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p21"></A><b>15.</b> <i>The long-suffering of our Lord.</i> He takes it as granted that Christ defers the day of his coming, because he has a regard for our salvation. He hence animates the faithful, because in a longer delay they have an evidence as to their own salvation. Thus, what usually disheartens others through 				weariness, he wisely turns to a contrary purpose.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p22"></A><i>Even as our beloved brother Paul.</i> We may easily gather from the Epistle to the Galatians, as well as from other places, that unprincipled men, who went about everywhere to disturb the churches, in order to discredit Paul, made use of this pretense, that he did not well agree with the other Apostles. It is then probable that Peter referred to Paul in 				order to shew their consent; for it was very necessary to take away the occasion for such a calumny. And yet, when I examine all things more narrowly, it seems to me more probable that this Epistle was composed by another according to what Peter communicated, than that it was written by himself, for Peter himself would have never spoken thus. But it is enough for me that we have a witness of his doctrine and of his goodwill, who brought forward nothing contrary to what he would have himself 				said.</p>

 				 The meaning is, that in the things which he wrote there was sometimes an obscurity, which gave occasion to the unlearned to go astray to their own ruin. We are reminded by these words, to reason soberly on things so high and obscure; and further, we are here strengthened against this kind of offense, lest the foolish or absurd speculations of men should disturb us, by which they entangle and distort simple truth, which ought to serve for edification.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p30"></A>But we must observe, that we are not forbidden to read Paul's Epistles, because they contain some things hard and difficult to be understood, but that, on the contrary, they are commended to us, provided we bring a calm and teachable mind. For Peter condemns men who are trifling and volatile, who strangely turn to their own ruin what is useful to all. Nay, he says that this is commonly done as to all the Scripture: and yet he does not 				hence conclude, that we are not to read it, but only shews, that those vices ought to be corrected which prevent improvement, and not only so, but render deadly to us what God has appointed for our salvation.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p31"></A>It may, however, be asked, Whence is this obscurity, for the Scripture shines to us like a lamp, and guides our steps? To this I reply, that it is nothing to be wondered at, if Peter ascribed obscurity to the mysteries of Christ's kingdom, and especially if we consider how hidden they are to the perception of the flesh. However the mode of teaching which God has adopted, has been so regulated, that all who refuse not to follow the Holy 				Spirit as their guide, find in the Scripture a clear light. At the same time, many are blind who stumble at mid-day; others are proud, who, wandering through devious paths, and flying over the roughest places, rush headlong into ruin.</p>

<p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p33"></A><b>17.</b> <i>Ye, therefore, beloved.</i> After having shewn to the faithful the dangers of which they were to beware, he now concludes by admonishing them to be wise. But he shews that there was need of being watchful, lest they should be overwhelmed. And, doubtless, the craft of our enemy, the many and various 				treacheries which he employs against us, the cavils of ungodly men, leave no place for security. Hence, vigilance must be exercised, lest the devices of Satan and of the wicked should succeed in circumventing us. It, however seems that we stand on slippery ground, and the certainty of our salvation is suspended, as it were, on a thread, since he declares to the faithful, that they ought to take heed lest they should fall from their own steadfastness.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p34"></A>What, then, will become of us, if we are exposed to the danger of falling? To this I answer, that this exhortation, and those like it, are by no means intended to shake the firmness of that faith which recumbs on God, but to correct the sloth of our flesh. If any one wishes to see more on this subject, let him read what has been said on the tenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p35"></A>The meaning is this, that as long as we are in the flesh, our tardiness must be roused, and that this is fitly done by having our weakness, and the variety of dangers which surround us, placed before our eyes; but that the confidence which rests on God's promises ought not to be thereby shaken.</p>

<p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p38"></A>The word <i>grace,</i> I take in a general sense, as meaning those spiritual gifts we obtain through Christ. But as we become partakers of these blessings according to the measure of our faith, <i>knowledge</i> is added to grace; as though he had said, that as faith 				increases, so would follow the increase of grace.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">186</FONT></A>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="vii.iv.ii-p17"></A> The two verses, the fifth and the sixth, have been differently explained. &#8220;The earth,&#8221; say some, &#8220;subsisting from water and through water,&#8221; that is, emerging from water and made firm and solid by means of water; which is true, for through moisture the earth adheres together and becomes a solid mass. Others render the last clause, &#8220;in water,&#8221; or in the midst of water, that is, surrounded by water; and this is the most suitable meaning.</p>  				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p18"></A>The <a name="vii.iv.ii-p18.1"></A>&#948;&#953; &#8127; &#8039;&#957; at the beginning of the sixth verse, refers, according to <i>Beza, Whitby,</i> and others, to the heavens and the earth in the preceding verse, the deluge being occasioned by &#8220;the windows of heaven being opened,&#8221; and &#8220;the fountains of the great deep being broken up.&#8221; 					 (<a name="vii.iv.ii-p18.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011">Ge 7:11</a><a name="vii.iv.ii-p18.2"></A>.) &#8220;By which (or by the means of which) the world at that time, being overflowed with water, was destroyed.&#8221;</p>  				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p19"></A>The objection to this view is, as justly stated by <i>Macknight</i>, that the correspondence between this verse and the following is thereby lost: the reservation of the world to be destroyed by fire is expressly ascribed, in verse seventh, to God&#8217;s word; and to the same ought the destruction of the old world to be ascribed. This is doubtless the meaning required by the passage, 					 but &#8220;which&#8221; being in the plural, creates a difficulty, and there is no different reading. <i>Macknight</i> solves the difficulty by saying that the plural &#8220;which&#8221; or whom, refers to &#8220;word,&#8221; meaning Christ, and &#8220;God,&#8221; as in the first verse of this chapter, &#8220;in both which,&#8221; a reference is made to what is implied in &#8220;the second Epistle,&#8221; that is, the first. He supposes that there is here the same anomalous mode of speaking. But the conjecture which has 					 been made is not improbable, that it is a typographical mistake, <a name="vii.iv.ii-p19.1"></A>&#8039;&#957; being put for <a name="vii.iv.ii-p19.2"></A>&#959;&#8023; or for <a name="vii.iv.ii-p19.3"></A>&#8003;&#957;.

<p class="Center"><a name="vii.iv.ii-p20"></A>5. &#8220;For of this they are wilfully ignorant, that the heavens existed of old and the earth (which subsisted from water and in water,) by<br> 					 6. the word of God; by which the world at that time, being over-<br> 					 7. flowed with water, was destroyed.

So that 					 the subjects in hand are the day of judgment, the future state, and the necessity of being prepared for it; and that these are the things referred to is evident from this, that he says, that Paul speaks of them in all his epistles, which is not true, as to what is said at the beginning of the 15th verse. The passage then ought to be thus rendered: &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="Center"><a name="vii.iv.iv-p27"></A><b>14.</b> Therefore, beloved, since ye expect these things, <br> 					 diligently strive to be found by him in peace, <br> 					 unspotted and unblamable; <br> 					 <b>15.</b> and deem the long-suffering of our Lord <i>to be for</i> salvation: <br> 					 even as Paul, our beloved brother, has, according to the wisdom given <br> 					 <b>16.</b> to him, written to you; as also in all his epistles, <br> 					 when speaking in them of these things; <br> 					 in which (epistles) there are some things difficult to be understood,&#8221; <br> 					 <i>etc.</i></p>  				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p28"></A>Now the special epistle referred to was most probably the epistle to the Hebrews, one particular design of which was to direct the attention of the Jews to the country promised to their fathers. Some, indeed, hold that that epistle was written to the Jews in Judea; but others maintain that it was written to converted Hebrews generally, whether in Judea or elsewhere; and this passage seems to favor the latter opinion.</p>  				  
<p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p29"></A>If the view given here is right, that is, that the subjects on which reference is made to Paul, are those mentioned in the 12th, the 13th, and 14th verses, then there is no epistle of Paul which could be more appropriately referred to than that to the Hebrews, as the new heavens and the new earth answer exactly to &#8220;the better and heavenly country,&#8221; mentioned in the 					 Epistle to the Hebrews. See <a name="vii.iv.iv-p29.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016">Heb 11:16</a><a name="vii.iv.iv-p29.1"></A>. Besides, the exhortations and warnings of that epistle wholly coincide with the exhortation given here by Peter. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>
