<p><a name="xxviii.i-p3"></A><b>1 </b>And it came to pass after the death of Moses, that Jehovah addressed Joshua, saying, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Moses my servant is dead: now therefore rise, pass over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, to the land which I give to them, namely, to the children of Israel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Every place which the sole of your foot shall have trod upon, I have given to you; as I said to Moses,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p6"></A><b>4 </b>From the desert and that Lebanon, even to the great sea, the river Euphrates, the whole land of the Hittites, even to the great sea toward the setting of the sun, will be your boundary.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p7"></A><b>5 </b>No one shall stand before thee all the days of thy life; because as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not desert nor forsake thee.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Be firm therefore and strong; for thou shall divide to this people as an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers that I would give them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Only be firm and strong exceedingly; that thou may keep and do according to the whole law which Moses my servant commanded thee: thou shall not draw back to the right hand or to the left, that thou may act prudently <i>(or </i>prosperously) in all things.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p10"></A><b>8 </b>Let not the book of this law depart from thy mouth; but meditate in it day and night, that thou may keep and do according to all which has been written in it. For then shall thou render thy ways prosperous, and then shall thou act prudently.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Have not I commanded thee to make thyself firm and strong? Fear not, nor be dispirited; since I, Jehovah thy God, am with thee in all the places to which thou goes.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Then Joshua commanded the prefects of the people, saying, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p13"></A><b>11 </b>Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Make ready provision for yourselves; for after three days shall you pass over this Jordan, that you may enter and possess the land, which Jehovah your God give you to possess.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p14"></A><b>12 </b>And to the Reubenites, and Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh, spoke Joshua, saying, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Remember the word which Moses, the servant of Jehovah, commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God has rendered you quiet, and has given you this land:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p16"></A><b>14 </b>Your wives, your little ones, and your flocks will remain in the land which Moses has given you beyond the Jordan; but you, as many of you as are men of war, will pass over armed before your brethren, and assist them,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p17"></A><b>15 </b>Until Jehovah shall have given rest to your brethren as to you; and they, too, possess the land which Jehovah your God give to them; and then shall you return to the land of your inheritance, and possess that which Moses, the servant of Jehovah, gave you beyond Jordan toward the rising of the sun.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p18"></A><b>16 </b>Then they answered Joshua, saying, All things which thou has commanded us will we do, and to all places to which thou shall send us, will we go.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p19"></A><b>17 </b>As in all things we obeyed Moses, so will we obey thee; only let Jehovah thy God be with thee as he was with Moses.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.i-p20"></A><b>18 </b>Whoever he shall be that shall rebel against thy mouth, and shall not acquiesce in thy words in all the things which thou shall command him, let him be put to death. Only be thou firm and strong.</p>  <a name="xxviii.ii"></A>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p1"></A>  		  
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref13"><a name="xxviii.ii-p2"></A>CHAPTER 2</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p3"></A><b>1 </b>Now, Joshua, the son of Nun, had sent from Sittim two men as spies secretly, saying: Go, examine the land and Jericho. They accordingly set out and entered the house of a woman, a harlot, whose name was Rahab, and slept there.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>And it was told to the king of Jericho, Behold, men of the children of Israel have come hither to-night to spy out the land.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring out the men who have gone in to thee, who have come to thy house; for they have come to spy out the whole land.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Now the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. Then she says, The men, indeed, came to me, but I knew not whence they were.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>And it was when the gate was shut in the darkness that the men went out, and I know not whither they went. Follow them quickly, for you shall apprehend them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Now she had caused them to go up upon the roof, and had hidden them under stalks of flax, arranged by her on the roof.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>And the men pursued them by the way of the Jordan, even to the fords; they, moreover, shut the gate as soon as those who pursued them went out.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>But before they were asleep, she herself went up on the roof to them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>And she says to the men, I know that Jehovah has given you the land, inasmuch as your terror has fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land have melted at your presence.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>For we heard how the Lord dried up the waters of the sea of Suph (the Red Sea) from before you when you went out from Egypt; and what things you did to the two kings of the Amorite, who were beyond Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you slew.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>We heard, and our heart was melted, neither had we any more spirit before you. For Jehovah your God is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Now therefore swear unto me, I pray, by Jehovah, (for I have dealt mercifully with you,) that you will also deal mercifully with the house of my father, and give me a true sign,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p15"></A><b>13 </b>That you will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all who are theirs, and will rescue our souls from death.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p16"></A><b>14 </b>The men said unto her, Our life for you unto death; only you will not betray this our conversation; then it will be that when Jehovah shall have delivered the land to us, we will deal truly and mercifully with you.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p17"></A><b>15 </b>She therefore let them down through the window by a rope; for her house was in the building of the wall, and she herself dwelt on the wall.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p18"></A><b>16 </b>And she said to them, Hasten to the mountain, lest perchance those who are pursuing fall in with you, and keep lurking there for three days, till those who are pursuing return, and afterwards you will go on your way.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p19"></A><b>17 </b>Then the men said to her, We shall be blameless from this your oath by which you have bound us.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p20"></A><b>18 </b>Behold, when we shall enter the land, you will bind this line of purple thread in the window by which you have let us down; moreover, you will assemble in the house with you, your father, and your mother, and all the family of your father.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p21"></A><b>19 </b>And it shall be that whoever shall go outside beyond the doors of the house, his blood shall be upon his head, but we shall be blameless; and whoever shall be with you, his blood shall be upon our head, if a hand be laid upon him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p22"></A><b>20 </b>But if you shall betray this our conversation, we shall be free from the oath by which you have bound us.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p23"></A><b>21 </b>She answered, As you have spoken, so be it. Then she sent them away, and they departed; and she bound the scarlet thread in the window.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p24"></A><b>22 </b>Having set out, they came to the mountain, and remained there three days, till the return of those who had pursued, who searched over the whole way, and did not find them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p25"></A><b>23 </b>Those two, therefore, returning after they came down from the mountain, passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and related to him whatever things had happened to them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.ii-p26"></A><b>24 </b>And they said to Joshua, Jehovah has delivered the whole land into our hands. For all the inhabitants of the land have become melted before our face.</p>  <a name="xxviii.iii"></A>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p1"></A>  		  
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref13"><a name="xxviii.iii-p2"></A>CHAPTER 3</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p3"></A><b>1 </b>And Joshua rose up very early in the morning, and he and all the children of Israel set out from Sittim, and came as far as the Jordan, and passed the night there before crossing.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>And it was at the end of three days, and the prefects passed through the midst of the camp,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests bearing it, you shall set out from your place, and go after it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Nevertheless, between it and you there will be an interval of about two thousand cubits in length: do not approach it that you may know the way by which you are to go. For you have not passed by that way yesterday or the day before yesterday.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Now Joshua had said to the people, Sanctify <i>(or </i>Prepare) yourselves: for to-morrow Jehovah will do wonders in the midst of you.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass before the people. They accordingly bare the ark of the covenant, and walked before the people.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Now Jehovah had said to Joshua, To-day will I begin to magnify thee in the eyes of all Israel, that they may know that in the same way as I was with Moses will I be with thee.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>Thou, therefore, wilt command the priests bearing the ark of the covenant, saying, When you shall have gone in as far as the extremity (outer edge) of the water of the Jordan, you shall stand in the Jordan.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of Jehovah your God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Joshua likewise said, Hereby shall you know that there is a living God in the midst of you, and that he will thoroughly drive out before you the Canaanite, the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>Behold the ark of the covenant of the ruler of the whole earth will pass before you through the Jordan.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Now, therefore, select for you twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one for each tribe.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p15"></A><b>13 </b>And when the soles of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of Jehovah, the ruler of the whole earth, shall have rested in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off, and the waters flowing from above shall stand in one heap.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p16"></A><b>14 </b>And it was that when the people set out to cross the Jordan, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant were before the people.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p17"></A><b>15 </b>And after those who bare the ark came even to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the extremity of the waters, (now the Jordan was full beyond all its banks the whole time of harvest,)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p18"></A><b>16 </b>The waters which descended from above stood, and rose up into one heap very far, from the city Adam which is at the side of Sarthan, and those which descended to the sea of the desert, the sea of salt, were consumed, were cut off: and the people crossed over against Jericho.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iii-p19"></A><b>17 </b>And the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood unencumbered <i>(or </i>prepared) on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, while all Israel crossed through dry ground, until the whole people made an end of passing the Jordan.</p>  <a name="xxviii.iv"></A>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p1"></A>  		  
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref13"><a name="xxviii.iv-p2"></A>CHAPTER 4</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p3"></A><b>1 </b>And it was after the whole people made an end of passing the Jordan; because Jehovah had spoken to Joshua, saying,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Take for you from the people twelve men, one man from each tribe;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And command them, saying, Take for you hence out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where the feet of the unencumbered priests stand, twelve stones which you shall carry with you, and deposit in the place where you shall remain this night.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed out of the children of Israel, one from each tribe.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p7"></A><b>5 </b>And Joshua said to them, Pass before the ark of Jehovah your God through the midst of the Jordan, and let every one of you take up one stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p8"></A><b>6 </b>That it may be among you, <i>(Hebrew, </i>in the midst of you,) when your children shall to-morrow ask their fathers, What are those stones beside you?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Then you may answer them, When the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, when, I say, it was crossing the Jordan, and the waters of the Jordan were cut off, then were those stones made to be a memorial to the children of Israel for ever.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p10"></A><b>8 </b>The children of Israel accordingly did as Joshua had commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as Jehovah had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and they brought them with them to the place where they passed the night, and laid them down there.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Joshua also erected twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan under the station of the feet of the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant, and they have remained there even to this day.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p12"></A><b>10 </b>And the priests, bearing the ark, kept standing in the midst of the Jordan, till all the speech which Jehovah had commanded Joshua to speak to the people was finished; exactly as Moses had commanded Joshua himself: but the people made haste in passing.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p13"></A><b>11 </b>And when the whole people had made an end of passing, the ark of Jehovah passed, and the priests in presence of the people.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p14"></A><b>12 </b>The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh also passed over armed before the children of Israel; in like manner as Moses had spoken to them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Forty thousand armed men passed over in presence of Jehovah to battle to the plains of Jericho.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p16"></A><b>14 </b>On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the eyes of all Israel, and they feared him just as they had feared Moses all the days of his life.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p17"></A><b>15 </b>And Jehovah spoke unto Joshua, saying,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p18"></A><b>16 </b>Command the priests bearing the ark of the testimony to ascend from the Jordan.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p19"></A><b>17 </b>And Joshua commanded the priests, saying, Ascend from the Jordan.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p20"></A><b>18 </b>Moreover, when the priests, bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, had ascended from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the feet of the priests were transferred to the dry land, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and they flowed as yesterday and the day before yesterday above all its banks.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p21"></A><b>19 </b>Now the people ascended from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal in the east district of Jericho.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p22"></A><b>20 </b>And the twelve stones which they had brought out of the Jordan, Joshua placed in Gilgal.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p23"></A><b>21 </b>And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your sons shall to-morrow ask their sons, saying, What mean those stones?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p24"></A><b>22 </b>You shall explain to your sons, saying, Israel passed through the dry land across that Jordan:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p25"></A><b>23 </b>Since Jehovah your God dried the waters of Jordan from before your face until you passed over; in like manner as Jehovah your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before our face till we passed over;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.iv-p26"></A><b>24 </b>That all the nations of the earth may recognize the hand of Jehovah, how mighty he is; that you may, during all days, fear Jehovah your God.</p>  <a name="xxviii.v"></A>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.v-p1"></A>  		  
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref13"><a name="xxviii.v-p2"></A>CHAPTER 5</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.v-p3"></A><b>1 </b>And it was when all the Amorite kings who were beyond the Jordan, on the west, and all the Canaanitish kings who were near the sea, had heard that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel till they passed over, their heart was melted, and there was no longer any spirit in them before the children of Israel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.v-p4"></A><b>2 </b>At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make for thee sharp knives, and again circumcise the children of Israel the second time.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.v-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And Joshua made himself sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel on the hill of foreskins.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.v-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Now this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them. The whole people who had come out from Egypt, all the males, men of war, had died in the desert on the way after they had come out from Egypt.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.v-p7"></A><b>5 </b>For the whole people who came out had been circumcised, but the whole people who had been born in the desert on the way, after they had come out from Egypt, they had not circumcised.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.v-p8"></A><b>6 </b>For the children of Israel walked through the desert till the extinction of the whole race of the men of war, who had come out from Egypt, who had not listened to the voice of Jehovah, to whom Jehovah had sworn that he would not show the land of which he had sworn to their fathers that he would give them &#8212; a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.v-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Their sons accordingly whom he substituted in their place, Joshua circumcised, because they were uncircumcised; for they had not circumcised them by the way.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.v-p10"></A><b>8 </b>And when the whole people were circumcised, they remained in their place in the camp till they were healed.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.v-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Jehovah said to Joshua, This day have I rolled off the reproach of Egypt from you. And he called the name of that place Gilgal even to this day.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.v-p12"></A><b>10 </b>The children of Israel therefore encamped in Gilgal, and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.v-p13"></A><b>11 </b>And they ate unfermented bread of the produce of the land, the day after the Passover, and cake on the very same day.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.v-p14"></A><b>12 </b>And the manna ceased the day after they ate of the corn of the country, nor had the children of Israel manna any longer, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.v-p15"></A><b>13 </b>And it happened when Joshua was at Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold a man stood over against him, in whose hand was a drawn sword, and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Art thou on our side? or art thou on our enemies&#8217; side?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.v-p16"></A><b>14 </b>And he said, Nay, but I am prince of the army of Jehovah: I have now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the ground, and worshipped, and said to him, What says my Lord to his servant?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.v-p17"></A><b>15 </b>And the prince of the army of the Lord said to Joshua, Loose thy shoe from thy feet: for the place on which thou stands is holiness. And Joshua did so.</p>  <a name="xxviii.vi"></A>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.vi-p1"></A>  		  
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref13"><a name="xxviii.vi-p2"></A>CHAPTER 6</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.vi-p3"></A><b>1 </b>And Jericho was closed, and was shut up because of the children of Israel, nor could any one go out or come in.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.vi-p4"></A><b>2 </b>And Jehovah said to Joshua, Behold, I have delivered into thy hand Jericho, and its king, and its men of valor.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.vi-p5"></A><b>3 </b>You shall therefore compass the city, all the men of war, going round it once: thus shall thou do six days.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.vi-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Moreover, seven priests shall bear seven rams&#8217; horns before the ark: But on the seventh day you shall compass the city seven times, and let the priests themselves sound with the trumpets.</p>

<p><a name="xxviii.x-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Then they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a large city, (citizenship or territory,) as one of the Royal cities, inasmuch as. it was greater than Hai, and all its men brave.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Therefore Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhiam king of Lachis, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Come up to me, and bring reinforcements to me, that we may smite Gibeon who has made peace with Joshua, and the children of Israel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Accordingly, the five Amorite kings, &#8212; the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon, they and all their armies assembled, and went up and encamped near Gibeon, and fought against it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Therefore the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp in Gilgal, saying, Do not keep back thy hands from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and assist us, for all the Amorite kings, dwelling in the mountain, have assembled against us.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Joshua therefore came up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, all the men of might.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p10"></A><b>8 </b>And Jehovah said to Joshua, Be not afraid of them; for I have delivered them into thy hand, nor shall any one of them stand in thy presence.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p11"></A><b>9 </b>And Joshua came upon them suddenly; for during the whole night he went up from Gilgal</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p12"></A><b>10 </b>And Jehovah crushed them before Israel, and smote them with a great overthrow in Gibeon, and pursued them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them even to Azecah, and even to Malzeda.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p13"></A><b>11 </b>And when they were fleeing from the face of Israel, and were on the descent of Beth-horon, Jehovah sent down upon them great stones from heaven even to Azecah, and they died; more died by the hailstones than those whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Then Joshua spoke to Jehovah on the day on which Jehovah delivered up the Amorite before the children of Israel. And he said in the eyes of Israel, Sun, wait in Gibeon, and Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p15"></A><b>13 </b>And the sun waited, and the moon stood until the people avenged themselves on their enemies. Has this not been written in the book of Jasar? <i>(or, </i>of right.) The sun therefore stood in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to set for about one entire day.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p16"></A><b>14 </b>And there was no day like that before it or after it, on which Jehovah hearkened to the voice of a man; for Jehovah was fighting for Israel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p17"></A><b>15 </b>And Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp in Gilgal.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p18"></A><b>16 </b>But the kings themselves had fled, and hid themselves in a cave in Malzeda.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p19"></A><b>17 </b>And it was told to Joshua in these words, The five kings have been found hidden in a cave in Malzeda.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p20"></A><b>18 </b>Then Joshua said, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men near it to guard them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p21"></A><b>19 </b>But do you follow after your enemies, and cut off their tail, <i>(or, </i>rear,) and allow them not to enter their cities; for Jehovah your God has delivered them into your hand.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p22"></A><b>20 </b>And when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of smiting them with a very great overthrow till they were consumed, and the survivors who had escaped had entered into fortified cities,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p23"></A><b>21 </b>The whole people returned to the camp to Joshua in Malzeda in peace; no one moved his tongue against the children of Israel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p24"></A><b>22 </b>Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring me those five kings from the cave.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p25"></A><b>23 </b>And they did so, namely, they brought to him those five kings from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p26"></A><b>24 </b>And when they had brought out those five kings to Joshua, Joshua called all the men of Israel, and he said to the leaders of the men of war who had accompanied him Come near, put your feet upon the necks of those kings. And they came near and put their feet upon their necks.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p27"></A><b>25 </b>Then Joshua said to them, Fear not and dread not, be strong and of good courage; for Jehovah will do thus to all your enemies against whom you fight.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p28"></A><b>26 </b>After this Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hung them on five gibbets; and they were suspended on the gibbets till evening.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p29"></A><b>27 </b>Moreover, at the time when the sun goes down, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the gibbets, and cast them into the cave in which they had hid themselves, and they placed great stones at the mouth of the cave until this day.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p30"></A><b>28 </b>But Joshua on that day took Malzeda, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and slew their king along with them, and left no soul which was in it surviving; and did to the king Malzeda as he had done to the king of Jericho.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p31"></A><b>29 </b>Thereafter, Joshua, and all Israel with him, passed over from Malzeda to Libna, and besieged Libna.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p32"></A><b>30 </b>And Jehovah delivered it also, and its king, into the hand of Israel, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and did not leave surviving a single soul which was in it; and did to its king in like manner as he had done to the king of Jericho.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p33"></A><b>31 </b>Joshua afterwards passed, and all Israel with him, from Libna to Lachis, and encamped near it, and besieged it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p34"></A><b>32 </b>And Jehovah gave Lachis into the hand of Israel, and he took it on the second day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and every soul which was in it, exactly as he had done to Libna.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p35"></A><b>33 </b>And Horam king of Gezer, went up to give assistance to Lachis, and Joshua smote him and his people, so that he did not leave a survivor.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p36"></A><b>34 </b>Joshua, moreover, and all Israel with him, passed from Lachis to Eglon, and they encamped against it, and besieged it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p37"></A><b>35 </b>And they took it on that day and smote it with the edge of the sword; and every soul which was there Joshua slew on that day exactly as he had done to Lachis.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p38"></A><b>36 </b>Joshua thereafter went up, and all Israel with him, from Eglon to Hebron, and besieged it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p39"></A><b>37 </b>And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king, and all its towns, and he did not leave surviving a single soul which was in it, exactly as he had done to Eglon. He accordingly destroyed it, and every soul which was in it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p40"></A><b>38 </b>Afterwards Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and besieged it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p41"></A><b>39 </b>And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king and all its towns, and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and slew every soul which was there; he did not leave a survivor; as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king, as he had done to Libna and its king.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p42"></A><b>40 </b>And thus Joshua smote all the land of the mountain, and the south, and the plain, and the slopes, and all their kings; he did not leave a survivor; he slew every soul, as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p43"></A><b>41 </b>Wherefore, Joshua smote from Cades-Barne even to Asa, and the whole land of Gosen even to Gibeon.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p44"></A><b>42 </b>And all those kings and their land Joshua took at the same time, for Jehovah the God of Israel was fighting for Israel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.x-p45"></A><b>43 </b>Thence Joshua, and all Israel with him, returned to the camp in Gilgal.</p>  <a name="xxviii.xi"></A>

<p><a name="xxviii.xi-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Joshua therefore came, and all the people of war with him, against them to the waters of Merom suddenly, and they rushed upon them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xi-p10"></A><b>8 </b>And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and pursued them as far as great Sidon, and even to the boiling springs, and even to the plain of Mispe on the east; and they smote them till he left none of them surviving.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xi-p11"></A><b>9 </b>And Joshua did to them as Jehovah had said to him; he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xi-p12"></A><b>10 </b>And Joshua having returned, at the same time took Hasor, and smote its king with the sword. For Hasor had formerly been the head of all those kingdoms.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xi-p13"></A><b>11 </b>They also smote every soul which was therein, destroying by the edge of the sword; no soul remained; and he burnt Hasor with fire.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xi-p14"></A><b>12 </b>All the cities of those kings Joshua took, and smote them with the edge of the sword, destroying them as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded.</p>

<p><a name="xxviii.xi-p18"></A><b>16 </b>And Joshua took all that mountain land, and all the south, and all the land of Goshen, and the plain and level lands, the mountain of Israel also, and its plain.</p>

<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p3"></A><b>1 </b>Then Joshua called the Reubenites and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>And said to them, you have kept all things which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, and you have obeyed my voice in all things which I have commanded you.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>You have not deserted your brethren now for many days, even to this day, but you have carefully observed the command of Jehovah your God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>And now Jehovah your God has given rest to your brethren, as he had said to them; now, therefore, return and set out to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Only observe carefully to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, to love Jehovah your God, and walk in all his ways, and observe his precepts, and adhere to him, and serve him with all your heart and all your soul.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>And Joshua blessed them, and discharged them, and they went away to their tents.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Now, to the half tribe of Manasseh Moses had given (an inheritance) in Basan; and to the other half, Joshua gave (an inheritance) with their brethren beyond Jordan on the west. And also when Joshua was dismissing them to their tents, and had blessed them,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>Then he spoke to them, saying, Return with much riches to your tents, and with very much property, with silver, and gold, and brass, and iron, and very much raiment; divide the spoils of your enemies with your brethren.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Accordingly, both the children of Reuben and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and went away from the children of Israel, from Silo, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, in which they had received a possession, according to the word of Jehovah, by the hand of Moses.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>And they came to the limits of the Jordan, which were in the land of Canaan, and the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, built there an altar near the Jordan, an altar of conspicuous appearance.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>And the children of Israel heard it said, Behold, the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, on the confines of the Jordan, at the crossing of the children of Israel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>The children of Israel, I say, heard, and the whole body of the children of Israel assembled in Silo, to go up against them to battle.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p15"></A><b>13 </b>And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, Phinehas, son of Eleazar the priest,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p16"></A><b>14 </b>And ten princes with him, a single prince for each house, selected from all the tribes of Israel; for there were single princes of the families of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p17"></A><b>15 </b>They came, therefore, to the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and spoke with them, saying,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p18"></A><b>16 </b>Thus says the whole congregation of Jehovah, What falsehood is this which you have devised against the God of Israel, in turning away this day from going after Jehovah, by building an altar for yourselves to rebel this day against Jehovah?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p19"></A><b>17 </b>Is it little for us to have been involved in the iniquity of Peor, from which we are not yet cleansed even at the present day, and yet there was a plague in the congregation of Jehovah?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p20"></A><b>18 </b>Now you are turning aside this day from going after Jehovah, and it will be that you will rebel this day against Jehovah, and to-morrow he will be wroth against the whole congregation of Israel;</p>

<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p22"></A><b>20 </b>Did not Achan, the son of Zerah, sin grossly in the anathema, and was (there not) anger against the whole congregation of Israel? That man did not die alone on account of his iniquity.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p23"></A><b>21 </b>And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh answered and spoke with the princes of the thousands of Israel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p24"></A><b>22 </b>Jehovah, God of gods, Jehovah, God of gods, himself knoweth, and Israel will know; if it be through rebellion, if it be through falsehood, against Jehovah, save us not this day.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p25"></A><b>23 </b>If we have thought to build for us an altar, to turn away from going after Jehovah; if to sacrifice upon it burnt-offerings and sacrifice; and if to make upon it sacrifices of prosperity, let Jehovah himself inquire:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p26"></A><b>24 </b>And if we have not rather done it from a fear of this thing, saying, Your children will to-morrow speak unto our children, saying, What have you to do with Jehovah the God of Israel?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p27"></A><b>25 </b>For Jehovah has put the Jordan as a boundary between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad; you have no portion in Jehovah; and your children will make our children desist from fearing Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p28"></A><b>26 </b>And we said, Let us now give our endeavor to build an altar, neither for burnt-offerings nor for sacrifice;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p29"></A><b>27 </b>But that it may be a witness betwixt us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may diligently serve Jehovah before him in our burnt-offerings, and our sacrifices, and our offerings of prosperity; and lest your children may to-morrow say to our children, You have no part in Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p30"></A><b>28 </b>We said therefore, And it shall be, if they say to us or to our generations to-morrow, then shall we say, You see the likeness of an altar to Jehovah, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice, but to be a witness between us and you.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p31"></A><b>29 </b>Far be it from us to rebel against Jehovah, and to turn away this day from going after Jehovah, by building an altar for a burnt-offering, for oblation, and for sacrifice, beyond the altar of Jehovah our God, which is before his tabernacle.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p32"></A><b>30 </b>Moreover, when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, and the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, had heard the words which the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh had spoken, it was pleasing in their eyes.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p33"></A><b>31 </b>And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, said to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we know that Jehovah is in the midst of us, in that you have not sinned that sin against Jehovah; then you have freed the children of Israel from the hand of Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p34"></A><b>32 </b>Therefore Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, and those princes returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the other children of Israel, and reported the matter to them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p35"></A><b>33 </b>And the thing was pleasing in the eyes of the children of Israel, and the sons of Israel blessed God, and did not determine to go up against them to battle, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad were dwelling.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxviii.xxii-p36"></A><b>34 </b>And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Hed, saying, For it will be a witness between us that Jehovah is God.</p>  <a name="xxviii.xxiii"></A>

<p><a name="xxviii.xxiii-p16"></A><b>14 </b>And lo, I am this day entering the way of all the earth; know, therefore, with your whole heart and your whole soul, that not one word has fallen of all the most excellent words which Jehovah your God spoke over you; all things have happened to you; not one word of them has fallen.</p>
