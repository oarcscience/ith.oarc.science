<p><a name="xviii.i-p2"></A><b>1.</b> <i>This</i> then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; <i>even</i> to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward <i>was</i> the uttermost part of the south coast.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p3"></A><b>1. </b>Fuitque sors tribui filiorum Jehuda per familias eorum juxta terminum Edom, et desertum Sin ad austrum ab extremo austri.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p4"></A><b>2.</b> And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p5"></A><b>2. </b>Fuitque ejus terminus meridici ab extremo maris salis, hoc est a petra quae respicit ad meridiem.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p6"></A><b>3.</b> And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p7"></A><b>3. </b>Et egreditur versus meridiem Maale-acrabim, et illinc transit in Sin: progrediens autem a meridie in Cades-barnea transit illinc in Esron, et rursum ascendit in Adar, unde circuit in Carcaa.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p8"></A><b>4.</b> <i>From thence</i> it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.</p>

<p><a name="xviii.i-p10"></A><b>5.</b> And the east border <i>was</i> the salt sea, <i>even</i> unto the end of Jordan. And <i>their</i> border in the north quarter <i>was</i> from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p11"></A><b>5. </b>Terminus vero ad orientem, est mare salis usque ad extremitatem Jordanis, terminus autem anguli aquilonaris a petra maris ab extremo Jordanis.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p12"></A><b>6.</b> And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p13"></A><b>6. </b>Ascenditque terminus iste in Beth-hoglah, et transit ab aquilone ad Betharaba, atque illinc ascendit terminus iste ad lapidem Bohan filii Ruben.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p14"></A><b>7.</b> And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that <i>is</i> before the going up to Adummim, which <i>is</i> on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p15"></A><b>7. </b>Ascendit praeterea terminus iste in Debir a valle Achor, et versus aquilonem respicit ad Gilgal, quae est e regione ascensus Adummim, quae quidem est ab austro torrenti: et transit terminus iste ad aquas En-semes, suntque exitus ejus ad En-rogel.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p16"></A><b>8.</b> And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same <i>is</i> Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that <i>lieth</i> before the valley of Hinnom westward, which <i>is</i> at the end of the valley 				  of the giants northward:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p17"></A><b>8. </b>Et ascendit terminus iste ad vallem filii Hinnom, ad latus Jebusaei a meridie, ipsa est Jerusalem: ascendit insuper terminus iste ad verticem montis qui est e regione vallis Hinnom ad occidentem, quae quidem est in extremitate vallis Rephaim ad aquilonem.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p18"></A><b>9.</b> And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which <i>is</i> Kirjathjearim:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p19"></A><b>9. </b>Circuit autem terminus a vertice ipsius montis, ad fontem aquae Nephthoeh, et egreditur ad urbes montis Ephron, circuitque terminus iste in Baala, ipsa est Cirjath-jearim.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p20"></A><b>10.</b> And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which <i>is</i> Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p21"></A><b>10. </b>Et illinc gyrat terminus iste a Baala ad occidentem ad montem Seir, et illinc pertransit ad latus montis Jearim ab aquilone, ipsa est Chesalon, descenditque in Bethsemes, et pertransit in Timna.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p22"></A><b>11.</b> And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p23"></A><b>11. </b>Egrediturque terminus ad latus Ecron ad Aquilonem, et circuit terminus iste ad Sichron, pertransitque ad montem Baala, et illinc egreditur in Jabneel, suntque exitus hujus termini ad mare.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p24"></A><b>12.</b> And the west border <i>was</i> to the great sea, and the coast <i>thereof</i>. This <i>is</i> the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.</p>

<p><a name="xviii.i-p26"></A><b>13.</b> And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, <i>even</i> the city of Arba the father of Anak, which <i>city is</i> Hebron.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.i-p27"></A><b>13. </b>Caleb autem filio Jephune dedit partem in medio filiorum Jehuda, secundum sermonem Jehovae ad Josue, Cirjath-arba patris Anac, ipsa est Hebron.</p>

<p><a name="xviii.i-p30"></A><b>1.</b> I have already premised, that I would not be very exact in delineating the site of places, and in discussing names, partly because I admit that I am not well acquainted with topographical or chorographic science, and partly because great labor would produce little fruit to the reader;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">144</FONT></A>
 			 nay, perhaps the greater part of readers would toil and perplex themselves without receiving any benefit. With regard to the subject in hand, it is to be observed, that the lot of the tribe of Judah not only falls on elevated ground, the very elevation of the territory, indicating the dignity of the future kingdom, but a similar presage is given by its being the first lot that turns up. What had already been obtained by arms, they begin to divide. The names of the ten tribes are cast 			 into the urn. Judah is preferred to all the others. Who does not see that it is raised to the highest rank, in order that the prophecy of Jacob may be fulfilled? Then within the limits here laid down, it is well known that there were rich pastures, and vineyards celebrated for their productiveness and the excellence of their wines. In this way, while the lot corresponds with the prophecy of Jacob, it is perfectly clear that it did not so happen by chance; the holy patriarch had only uttered 			 what was dictated by the Spirit.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.i-p32"></A>If any are better skilled in places, a more minute investigation will be pleasant and useful to them. But lest those who are less informed feel it irksome to read unknown names, let them consider that they have obtained knowledge of no small value, provided they bear in mind the facts to which I have briefly and summarily adverted &#8212; that the tribe of Judah was placed on elevated ground, that it might be more conspicuous than the others, 			 until the scepter should arise from it &#8212; and that a region of fruitful vineyards and rich pastures was assigned to his posterity &#8212; and, finally, all this was done, in order that the whole people might recognize that there was nothing of the nature of chance in the turning up of a lot, which had been foretold three centuries before. Besides, it is easy for the unlearned to infer from the long circuit described, that the territory thus allocated to one tribe was of great extent.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">145</FONT></A>
 			 For although some diminution afterwards took place, its dominions always continued to be the largest.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.i-p34"></A>It is necessary, however, to bear in mind what I formerly observed, that nothing else was determined by the lot than that the boundary of the children of Judah was to be contiguous to the land of Edom and the children of Sin, and that their boundary, in another direction, was to be the river of Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea &#8212; that those who had been selected to divide the country proceeded according to the best of their judgment, in 			 proportioning the quantity of territory allotted to the number of their people, without extending their boundaries any farther &#8212; and that they followed the same method in other cases, as vicinity or other circumstances demanded.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.i-p35"></A>Any error into which they fell, did not at all affect the general validity of their decision. For as they were not ashamed partly to recall any partition that might have been made without sufficient consideration, so the people in their turn, while they acknowledged that they had acted in the matter with the strictest good faith and honesty, submitted the more willingly to whatever they determined. Thus, notwithstanding any particular error, 			 their general arrangements received full effect.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.i-p36"></A>It will be worth while to make one remark on the city Jebus, whose name was afterwards Jerusalem. Although it had been already chosen, by the secret counsel of God, for his sanctuary, and the seat of the future kingdom, it however continued in the possession of the enemy down to the time of David. In this long exclusion from the place on which the sanctity, excellence, and glory of the rest of the land were founded, there was a clear 			 manifestation of the divine curse inflicted to punish the people for their sluggishness: since it was virtually the same as if the land had been deprived of its principal dignity and ornament. But on the other hand, the wonderful goodness of God was conspicuous in this, that the Jebusites who, from the long respite which had been given them, seemed to have struck their roots most deeply, were at length torn up, and driven forth from their secure position.</p>

<p><a name="xviii.i-p38"></A><b>13.</b> <i>And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh,</i> etc Were we to judge from the actual state of matters, it would seem ridiculous repeatedly to celebrate an imaginary grant from which Caleb received no benefit while Joshua was alive. But herein due praise is given both to the truth of God, and to the faith of his saint in resting on 			 his promise. Therefore, although sneering men, and the inhabitants of the place itself, if the rumor had reached them, might have derided the vain solicitude of Caleb, and the empty liberality of Joshua, the contempt thus expressed would only have proved them to be presumptuous scoffers. God at length evinced the firmness of his decree by the result, and Caleb, though he saw himself unable to obtain access to the mountain, testified that he was contented with the mere promise of God, the true 			 exercise of faith, consisting in a willingness to remain without the fruition of things which have been promised till the period actually arrive. Moreover, this passage, and others similar to it, teach us that the giants who are usually called Enakim, were so named after their original progenitor, Enac, and that the word is hence of Gentile origin. The time when Caleb routed the sons of Enac we shall see in a short time. This passage also shows us that Caleb, when he brought forward the name of 			 Moses, did not make a mere pretence, or utter anything that was not strictly true; for it is now plainly declared, that Moses had so appointed, in conformity with the command of God.</p>  <a name="xviii.ii"></A>

<p><a name="xviii.ii-p10"></A><b>18.</b> And it came to pass, as she came <i>unto him</i>, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off <i>her</i> ass; and Caleb said unto her, What would thou?</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xviii.ii-p11"></A><b>18. </b>Fuitque quum veniret ipsa suasit illi, ut peteret a patre suo agrum, et descendit de asino, dixitque ei Caleb, Quid tibi est?</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xviii.ii-p12"></A><b>19.</b> Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou has given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.</p>

<p><a name="xviii.ii-p104"></A>Here we have a narrative of what plainly appears from the book of Joshua to have taken place subsequent to the death of Joshua; but lest a question might have been raised by the novelty of the procedure, in giving a fertile and well watered field as the patrimony of a woman, the writer of the book thought proper to insert a history of that which afterwards happened, in order that no ambiguity might remain in regard to the lot of the tribe 			 of Judah. First, Caleb is said, after he had taken the city of Hebron, to have attacked Debir or Ciriath-sepher, and to have declared, that the person who should be the first to enter it, would be his son-in-law. And it appears, that when he held out this rare prize to his fellow-soldiers for taking the city, no small achievement was required. This confirms what formerly seemed to be the case, that it was a dangerous and difficult task which had been assigned him, when he obtained his 			 conditional grant. Accordingly, with the view of urging the bravest to exert themselves, he promises his daughter in marriage as a reward to the valor of the man who should first scale the wall.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.ii-p105"></A>It is afterwards added that Othniel who was his nephew by a brother, gained the prize by his valor. I know not how it has crept into the common translation that he was a younger brother of Caleb; for nothing in the least degree plausible can be said in defense of the blunder. Hence some expositors perplex themselves very unnecessarily in endeavoring to explain how Othniel could have married his niece, since such marriage was forbidden by 			 the law. It is easy to see that he was not the uncle, but the cousin of his wife.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.ii-p106"></A>But here another question arises, How did Caleb presume to bargain concerning his daughter until he was made acquainted with her inclinations?  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">146</FONT></A>
 			 Although it is the office of parents to settle their daughters in life, they are not permitted to exercise tyrannical power and assign them to whatever husbands they think fit without consulting them. For while all contracts ought to be voluntary, freedom ought to prevail especially in marriage that no one may pledge his faith against his will. But Caleb was probably influenced by the belief that his daughter would willingly give her consent, as she could not modestly reject such 			 honorable terms;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">147</FONT></A>
 			 for the husband to be given her was no common man, but one who should excel all others in warlike prowess. It is quite possible, however, that Caleb in the heat of battle inconsiderately promised what it was not in his power to perform. It seems to me, however, that according to common law, the agreement implied the daughter&#8217;s consent, and was only to take effect if it was obtained.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_147"></A><A HREF="#fn_147"><FONT SIZE="1">148</FONT></A>
 			 God certainly heard the prayer of Caleb, when he gave him a son-in-law exactly to his mind. For had the free choice been given him, there was none whom he would have preferred.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xviii.ii-p110"></A><a name="xviii.ii-p110.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.ii-p111"></A><b>18.</b><i> And it came to pass as she came unto him, </i>etc Although we may conjecture that the damsel Acsa was of excellent morals and well brought up, as marriage with her had been held forth as the special reward   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_148"><FONT SIZE="1">149</FONT></A>
 			  of victory, yet perverse cupidity on her part is here disclosed. She knew that by the divine law women were specially excluded from hereditary lands, but she nevertheless covets the possession of them, and stimulates her husband by unjust expostulation. In this way ambitious and covetous wives cease not to molest their husbands until they force them to forget shame, modesty, and equity. For although the avarice of men also is insatiable, yet women are apt to be much 			 more precipitate. The more carefully ought husbands to be on their guard against being set as it were on flame by the blast of such importunate counsels.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">150</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.ii-p114"></A>But a greater degree of intemperance is displayed when she acquires additional boldness from the facility of her husband and the indulgence of her father. Not contented with the field given to her, she demands for herself a well-watered district. And thus it is when a person has once overleaped the bounds of rectitude and honesty, the fault is forthwith followed up by impudence. Moreover, her father in refusing her nothing gives proof of 			 his singular affection for her. But it does not therefore follow that the wicked thirst of gain which blinds the mind and perverts right judgment is the less hateful. In regard to Acsa&#8217;s dismounting from the ass, some interpreters ascribe it to dissimulation and craft, as if she were pretending inability to retain her seat from grief. In this way her dismounting or falling off is made an indication of criminality and defective character. It is more simple, however, to suppose that she placed 			 herself at her father&#8217;s feet with the view of accosting him as a suppliant. Be this as it may, by her craft and flattery she gained his consent, and in so far diminished the portion of her brothers.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_150"></A><A HREF="#fn_150"><FONT SIZE="1">151</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xviii.ii-p117"></A><b>20.</b> <i>This is the inheritance, </i>etc He had formerly, indeed, traced out the boundaries of the children of Judah; but it is now shown for a different reason how large and fertile the territory was which the Lord in his great liberality had bestowed upon them. One hundred and thirteen cities with their towns and villages are 			 enumerated. The number attests not only the populousness, but also the fertility of the country. And there cannot be a doubt that by the divine blessing a new degree of fertility was imparted to it. The goodness of God was, however, manifested in the very nature of the land selected for his people, a land abounding in all kinds of advantages. If we attend to the number of souls in the tribe, we shall find that one half of the country would have been amply sufficient for their habitation. For 			 when eight hundred were allocated in each of the cities, the remainder had the towns and the villages. It is no doubt true that a portion was afterwards withdrawn and given to the tribe of Simeon. For in this was accomplished the dispersion of which Jacob had prophesied,</p>

Therefore, it was owing entirely to their own sluggishness that they did not make themselves masters of the city of Jerusalem. This they were not able to do; but their own torpor, their neglect of the divine command from a love of ease, were the real obstacles.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xviii.ii-p122"></A>This passage is deserving of notice: we ought to learn from it to make vigorous trial of our strength in attempting to accomplish the commands of God, and not to omit any opportunity, lest while we are idly resting the door may be shut.

At the same time it ought to be remembered, that accurate and detailed descriptions of the boundaries of the different tribes were absolutely indispensable to the Israelites themselves, to whom they formed a 				  kind of title-deeds, vindicating their right of possession, and securing them against encroachment. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xviii.ii-p107"></A> If we are to indulge in conjectures on the subject, this question might be answered by another, How do we know that Caleb had not consulted her inclinations, and instead of resting satisfied with the vague imaginings here ascribed to him, actually obtained her consent to the proposal which he was about to make? It may not have been, as Calvin supposes, a sudden thought which struck him in the heat of battle, but a calm resolve formed before he 				  set out on his expedition against Debir, and intended to reward the most valiant of those who had assisted him in his war against the giants. And it is even not impossible that both he and his daughter, to whom Othniel, from his near relationship, must have been well known, had no doubt from the prowess he had previously exhibited, that he would outstrip all his competitors and carry off the prize. These, of course, are mere conjectures, but they are at least as plausible as those indulged in 				  by other expositors, who, after raising the question, appear to have given themselves much unnecessary trouble in attempting to solve it. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>
