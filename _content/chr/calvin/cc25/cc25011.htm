<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref16"><a name="xii-p1"></A>A LIST OF THE MOST ANCIENT AND MODERN BRITISH AND FOREIGN EXPOSITIONS OF DANIEL,</p>  		
<p class="QUOTE31"><a name="xii-p2"></A>With Concise Epitomes Of The Contents Of The Most Important.</p>  		
<p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld14"><a name="xii-p3"></A>1 Jewish Commentators.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p4"></A>Dr. Kennicott first edited a Hebrew interpretation of the Chaldee chapters of Daniel and Ezra from an ancient codex. It was translated and re-edited by J. L. Shulze. Hal., 1782.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p5"></A>Buxtorf edited a Hebrew Commentary on Daniel by Rabbi <i>Saadiah Hag-gaon, </i>who lived in Egypt and died about the middle of the tenth century. Basil., A.D. 1618.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p6"></A>R. Solomon Jarchi&#8217;s Commentary on Daniel is exceedingly full and clear in its verbal explanations. The edition of J. F. Breithaupt, Gotham, 1713, is <i>very </i>convenient, and full of most valuable Hebrew criticisms.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p7"></A>R. Isaac Abarbanel, who is frequently refuted by Calvin in the preceding Lectures, has been mentioned in our Ezekiel, vol. 2 p. 403. He entities his comments on Daniel, &#8220;The Fountains of Salvation.&#8221; They were first published at Naples, A.D. 1497: again in A.D. 1551, without the name of any place, and again at Amsterdam, A.D. 1647.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p8"></A>R. Joseph Teitzak, who lived in the fifteenth century, wrote a Commentary on Daniel, published at Venice, A.D. 1608.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p9"></A>R. Joseph the son of David the son of Joseph Jachia, commonly called Jacchiades, who died A.D. 1539, wrote a</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p10"></A><i>Paraphrase on Daniel, </i>in much repute: published at Amsterdam, A.D. 1633.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p11"></A>R. Moses Alschech, who lived at the close of the sixteenth century, called his Commentary on this Prophet, &#8220;The Rose of Sharon:&#8221; published at Zaphetae, A.D. 1568, and at Venice, A.D. 1592.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p12"></A>R. Samuel, son of R. Judah Valerius, entitled his comment on this Prophet, &#8220;The Vision of the Time Appointed.&#8221; Venice, A.D. 1586.</p>  		
<p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld14"><a name="xii-p13"></A>2 Early Fathers.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p14"></A>The Greek Commentary on this Prophet by Hippolytus, Bishop of the harbor of Rome, has been already mentioned. It was first edited at Paris, A.D. 1672, in a general collection of the Greek Fathers, and afterwards <i>Jo. Alb. Fabricius </i>published the whole of his works at Hamburgh, A.D. 1716 and 1718. His explanations of chaps. 7 to 12 are edited from the Chisian codex according to the Septuagint translation, which, as we have formerly stated, 		  was first published at Rome, A.D. 1772.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p15"></A>Ephrem Syrus wrote his Commentary on this Prophet about A.D. 370. It was published at Rome, A.D. 1740, by <i>Peter Benedict, </i>both in Syriac and Latin. See vol. 2 p. 203 and following.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p16"></A>Jerome&#8217;s valuable exposition of this Prophet is found in vol. 5 of his works, p. 2. Edit. Vallarsii. Venice, A.D. 1768.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p17"></A>Theodoret&#8217;s valuable comments on Daniel are found in vol. 2 pt. 2 p. 1053, of the edition of his works by J. L. Schulze. Hal. Saxon., A.D. 1 768.</p>  		
<p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld14"><a name="xii-p18"></A>3 Early Reformers.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p19"></A>Martini Lutheri <i>Auslegung des Propheten Daniels, </i>consists of three parts, published at different times at Wittemberg, from A.D. 1530 to 1546. See <i>Jo. G. Walch&#8217;s </i>preface to Luther&#8217;s Works, vol. 6 p. 13, and p. 1422 and following.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p20"></A>Jo. Oecolampadii <i>Commentariorum in Danielem, Libri Duo. </i>Basileae, A.D. 1530, 1543, and 1562: also, Geneva, A.D. 1553, <i>1567, </i>and 1578. A very valuable exposition, and more in accordance with modern views of Antichrist and the spiritual nature of our Lord&#8217;s kingdom, than the Lectures of Calvin.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p21"></A>Philippi Melancthonis <i>Commentarius in Danielem Prophetam. </i>Wittemberg, A.D. 1543: published also in his works, and translated into German by <i>Justus Jonas. </i>P. 2 p. 416. A.D. 1546.</p>  		
<p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld14"><a name="xii-p22"></A>4 Authors quoted by Poole<br> 		  in his Synopsosis on Daniel.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p23"></A>As Poole merely gives the name of his authors without any hint as to the titles and dates of their works, the following information will be of use. It is confined exclusively to Daniel</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p24"></A>Victorini Strigelii, <i>Danielis Prophetae Concio. </i>Lipsiae, A.D. 1565, 1571, 1572. 8vo.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p25"></A>Benedicti Pererii, <i>Com. in Danielem. </i>Romae, A.D. 1586: also Lugduni, A.D. 1588, 1591, 1602: et Antverpiae, 1594</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p26"></A>Francisci Juan, <i>Expositio Prophetae Danielis. </i>Heidelberg, A.D. 1593: Geuevae, 1594.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p27"></A>Amandi Polani A Polensdorf <i>in Danielem Prophetam Commentarius. </i>Basil., A.D. 1593, 4to, et 1606, 8vo.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p28"></A>Joannes Maldonati, <i>Commentarii in prophetas quatuor Jeremiam, Ezekiel, Baruch, et Danielem. </i>Moguntiae, A.D. 1611.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p29"></A>The translation is good; the comments short and explanatory of the Hebrew words; and it is to be expected that a Jesuit would occasionally direct his shafts against &#8220;Calvinianis.&#8221;</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p30"></A>Hugone Broughtono, <i>Commentarius in Danielem primum Anglice scriptus. </i>First published in English in London, A.D. 1596 and 1597.<i> Jo. Boreel </i>translated it into Latin at Basil, A.D. 1599. Small 4to.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p31"></A>The Latin translation is materially influenced by Rabbinical comments on the Hebrew and Chaldee text. The work is very valuable as a repository of historical information in the words of the original Greek historians.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p32"></A>Hexapla In Danielem By Andrew Willet. Cambridge, A.D. 1610.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p33"></A>A very valuable collection of the opinions of others, and a good study for those who are interested in the variety of speculations which have been invented concerning the prophecies of this book. The difficult questions &#8220;handled&#8221; are 536, and the knotty controversies undertaken are 134. In addition to most of the standard writers quoted by Poole, <i>Pintus </i>is introduced, whose work is entitled, <i>Hectoris Pinti, Commentarii in Danielem, 		  Lamentationes, Jeremiae, et Nahum. </i>Conimbrae, A.D. 1582. Venetiis, A.D. 15S3. Colon., A.D. 1587. Antverpiae, A.D. 1595.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p34"></A>Poole also quotes the translations of this Prophet made <i>by Pagninus, Montanus, and Malvenda, </i>who are Roman Catholics; and <i>Munster, Junius </i>and <i>Tremellius, </i>and <i>Castalio, </i>who are Protestants. Their various merits are given by H. Horne, vol. 2, part 2, pp. 62, 64, who states the authorities from which he derives his own information.</p>  		
<p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld14"><a name="xii-p35"></A>5 Foreign Interpreters.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p36"></A>The best of these are German. Their variety is great; a few only can be noticed here; others will be found in abundance in Rosenmuller&#8217;s <i>Elenchus </i>Interpretum.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p37"></A>Martini Geieri, <i>Praelectiones Academicae in Danielem. </i>Lipsiae, A.D. 1667, 1684, 1697, 1702: and repeated in vol. it. of his works. Amsterdam, A.D. 1695, folio. &#8220;One of the most valuable,&#8221; writes H. Horne, &#8220;of all Geier&#8217;s expository works.&#8221;</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p38"></A>Prodromus Danielicus auctore Jo. Ger. Kerkherdere. Lovanii, A.D. 1711. 12mo.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p39"></A>A small yet learned volume by the historian to his Catholic Majesty Charles III., containing many criticisms and attempts to reconcile historical difficulties. In many points very illustrative of Calvin&#8217;s sentiments.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p40"></A>Herman Venema,<i> Dissertationes </i>ad vaticinia Danielis emblematica, cap. 2, 7, et 8. Leovardiae, A.D. 1745: another vol. contains his exposition of cap. 11:4; 12:3. Leovardiae, A.D. 1752. 4to.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p41"></A>Ch. B. Michaelis, <i>Annotationes philologico-exegeticae in Danielem. </i>Hal., A.D. 1720.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p42"></A>J. D. Michaelis, <i>Epistolae de LXX. Hebdomadibus Danielis. </i>London, A.D. 1773.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p43"></A>H. Havernick&#8217;s <i>New Commentary on the Book of Daniel. </i>The original title is, Neue critische untersuchungen uber das buch Daniel. Von Heinrich Havernick. Hamburgh, A.D. 1838. This small volume of the excellent Professor at Rostock is much esteemed.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p44"></A>Emst. Wilm. Hengstenberg. Die Authentic des Daniel und die integritat des Sachariah. Berlin, A.D. 1831.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p45"></A>This work is now accessible to the English reader through the translation of the Revelation B. P. Pratten. Edinburgh, Clark, A.D. 1848.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p46"></A>Its contents are as follow: &#8212;</p>
