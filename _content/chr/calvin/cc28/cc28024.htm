<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p3"></A><b>1 </b>The word of Jehovah, which came to Micah, the Morasthite, in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Hear, all ye people, Give ear, O earth, and its fullness; (<b>155</b>) And the Lord Jehovah shall be against you a witness, <i>Even</i> the Lord from the temple of his holiness:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p5"></A><b>3 </b>For, behold, Jehovah goeth forth from his place, And will descend and tread on the heights of the earth;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p6"></A><b>4 </b>And melt shall the mountains under him, And rent shall be the valleys; As wax before the fire, As waters rolling into a lower place. (<b>160</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p7"></A><b>5 </b>For the wickedness of Jacob is all this, And for the transgressions of the house of Israel: What is the wickedness of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what are the high places of Judah? Are they not <i>those of</i> Jerusalem? (<b>162</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p8"></A><b>6 </b>I will therefore make Samaria A heap of the field, a plantation for vineyards; And I will roll into the valley its stones, And its foundations will I discover;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p9"></A><b>7 </b>And all her graven images shall be broken down, And all her rewards shall be burnt in the fire, And all her idols will I lay desolate; For from the reward of a harlot hath she gathered, And to the reward of a harlot shall they return.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p10"></A><b>8 </b>For this will I wail and howl, I will go spoiled and naked; I will make wailing as the dragons, And mourning as the daughters of the ostrich: (<b>170</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p11"></A><b>9 </b>For grievous is her stroke, For it has come to Judah, It has reached the gate of my people&#8212;even Jerusalem.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p12"></A><b>10 </b>In Gath tell ye it not; weeping, weep not; In the house of Ophrah, roll thyself in the dust.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p13"></A><b>11 </b>Pass over also, thou inhabitant of Saphir, Naked and in shame; Go forth shall not the inhabitant of Zaanan, In the mourning of Beth-ezel; She will take from you her station. (<b>176</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Verily, grieved for good has the inhabitant of Maroth; For come down has evil from Jehovah To the gate of Jerusalem.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Tie the chariot to the dromedary, Thou inhabitant of Lachish; The beginning of sin has she been to the daughter of Zion; For in thee have been found the transgressions of Israel.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p16"></A><b>14 </b>Thou shalt therefore send presents, For Moresheth-gath, to the sons of Achzib, (<b>180</b>) <i>Who have been</i> a deception to the kings of Israel.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p17"></A><b>15 </b>Yet a possessor will I send to thee, inhabitant of Mareshah; Even to Adullam, the glory of Israel, shall he come.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p18"></A><b>16 </b>Make bald, and poll thyself, For the children of thy delicacies; Enlarge thy baldness as the eagle, Inasmuch as they have migrated from thee.</p>  <a name="vi.ii.ii"></A>

<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p3"></A><b>1 </b>Woe to those who devise iniquity, And contrive wickedness on their beds! When the morning shines, they execute it; For to do it their hand is ready.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>And they covet fields, and forcibly take them; And houses, and they take them away; And they oppress a man and his house, A man and his heritage. (<b>187</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Therefore, thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; Behold, I am devising against this family an evil, From which ye shall not remove your necks; And ye shall not walk in your height, For an evil time will it be.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>In that day shall they take up against thee a proverb, And bewail with a lamentable lament, And say, &#8220;Wasted, we are laid waste; The portion of my people has he changed; How he takes away from me instead of restoring! Our fields he divides.&#8221; (<b>191</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>There shall not therefore be for thee One to cast a line for lot in the assembly of Jehovah.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>&#8220;Prophecy not, ye who prophesy;&#8221; &#8212; They shall not prophesy for them; &#8212; He will not take reproaches. (<b>195</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>O thou who art called the house of Jacob! Is the Spirit of Jehovah straightened? Are these his works? Are not my words good to him Who walks uprightly? (<b>201</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>And they who were heretofore my people, Have risen up as an enemy against me; The robe of beauty they plunder From those who pass by securely, As those who return from war. (<b>203</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>The women of my people have ye expelled From the house of their delights; From their children have ye taken away My ornament forever. (<b>204</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Arise, depart, for this is not <i>your</i> rest; Because it has been polluted: (<b>206</b>) He will scatter <i>you</i> with a violent scattering.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>If a man, walking in the spirit, and lying deceitfully, says, &#8220;I will prophesy to thee of wine and of strong drink,&#8221; He shall be the prophet of this people. (<b>208</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Gathering, I will gather the whole of thee Jacob, Assembling, I will assemble the residue of Israel; I will set them together as the sheep of Bozrah, As a flock in the midst of its fold; They shall make a noise on account <i>of the number</i> of men.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Ascend shall a breaker before them, They shall break through and pass the gate; Yea, they shall go out through it; And pass shall their king before them, And Jehovah at their head. (<b>215</b>)</p>  <a name="vi.ii.iii"></A>

<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p3"></A><b>1 </b>And I said, &#8220;Hear, I pray, ye princes of Jacob; And ye rulers of the house of Israel: Is it not for you to know judgment?&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>But they hate good and love evil; They pull off the skin from them, And the flesh from their bones:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Yea, they devour the flesh of my people, And their skin they strip from them, And their bones they break, And make them small as for the pot, And their flesh for the cauldron.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>They shall then cry to Jehovah, And he will not answer them, But he will hide his face from them at that time, As they have acted perversely in their doings.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Thus saith Jehovah to the Prophets, Who deceive my people, And bite with their teeth, and cry, &#8220;Peace;&#8221; And when any one putteth not in their mouth, Against him they declare war;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Night shall therefore be to you instead of a vision, And darkness shall be to you instead of divination;&#8217; And set shall the sun on the Prophets, And darkened over them shall be the day: (<b>227</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>And ashamed shall be the seers, And confounded shall be the diviners; And they shall all cover their lips, For there will be no answer from God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>But I indeed am filled with power, By the Spirit of Jehovah, yea, with judgment and courage, To declare to Jacob his wickedness, And to Israel his sin.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Hear this, I pray, ye princes of the house of Jacob, And ye rulers of the house of Israel, Who abominate judgment, And all rectitude pervert; (<b>237</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Who build Zion by blood, And Jerusalem by iniquity.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>Its princes judge for reward, And its priests for wages teach, And its prophets for money divine; And on Jehovah they lean, saying, &#8220;Is not Jehovah in the midst of us? Come upon us shall no evil.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Therefore for you Zion as a field shall be plowed, And Jerusalem shall be a heap, And the mount of the house as the heights of a forest.</p>  <a name="vi.ii.iv"></A>

<p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p3"></A><b>1 </b>But it shall be in the last days, That the mount of the house of Jehovah Shall be set in order on the top of the mountains, And elevated shall it be above the hills; And assemble there shall nations; (<b>252</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p4"></A><b>2 </b>And go shall many nations and say, &#8212; &#8220;Come and let us ascend to the mount of Jehovah, And to the house of the God of Jacob; And he will teach us of his ways, And we will walk in his paths:&#8221; For from Zion shall go forth a law, And the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And he will rule among many people, And convince strong nations afar off; (<b>260</b>) And beat their swords shall they into plowshares, And their spears into pruninghooks; And lift up shall not a nation against a nation a sword, And they shall learn war no more;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p6"></A><b>4 </b>And they shall sit everyone under his own vine, And under his own fig-tree; And none will there be to terrify them; For <i>thus</i> hath the mouth of Jehovah of hosts spoken.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p7"></A><b>5 </b>For all people shall walk, Every one in the name of his god; (<b>271</b>) But we will walk In the name of Jehovah our God forever.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p8"></A><b>6 </b>In that day, saith Jehovah, I will assemble the lame, And the driven out will I gather, And her whom I have afflicted:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p9"></A><b>7 </b>And I will make the lame a remnant, And the driven out a strong nation; Reign over them shall Jehovah on mount Zion, From henceforth, even forever.</p>

<p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Why dost thou now cry with a loud crying? Is there no king in thee? Has thy counselor perished? For seized thee has pain as one in travail.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Be in pain, and groan, O daughter of Zion, As a woman in travail; For go forth shalt thou from the city, And thou shalt dwell in the field, Yea, thou shalt go as far as Babylon; There shalt thou be delivered, There shall Jehovah redeem thee From the hand of thy enemies.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p13"></A><b>11 </b>And now gathered against thee are many nations, Who say, &#8220;Let her be condemned, And look shall our eye on Zion.&#8221; (<b>284</b>)</p>

<p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Arise, and thrash, thou daughter of Zion; For thy horn will I make iron, And thy hoofs will I make brass; And thou shalt tear in pieces strong nations; And consecrate to Jehovah their wealth, And their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.</p>  <a name="vi.ii.v"></A>

<p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p17"></A><b>15 </b>As in the days of thy going forth from the land of Egypt, I will show to him wonderful things.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p18"></A><b>16 </b>Shall see the nations, And be ashamed of all their might; They shall lay their hand on their mouth, Their ears shall become deaf;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p19"></A><b>17 </b>They shall lick the dust as a serpent, As reptiles of the earth shall they move from their holes; Jehovah our God shall they dread, And they shall be afraid of thee.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p20"></A><b>18 </b>What God is like thee, Taking away iniquity, And passing over transgression, As to the remnant of his heritage? He will not retain forever his anger, For he loveth mercy:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p21"></A><b>19 </b>He will return, he will have mercy on us; He will tread down our iniquities, And cast into the depths of the sea all their sins:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.vii-p22"></A><b>20 </b>Thou wilt grant truth to Jacob, Mercy to Abraham; Which thou hast sworn to our fathers In the days of old.</p>
