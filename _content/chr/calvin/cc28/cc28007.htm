<p><a name="iii.4.i-p10"></A>Jerome commends this grief of Jonah, and compares it to the holy zeal of Paul when he wished himself to be an anathema for his brethren, (<a name="iii.4.i-p10.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003">Ro 9:3</a><a name="iii.4.i-p10.1"></A>:) for he denies that he grieved because God had showed mercy to so illustrious a city; but because the conversion of the Gentiles was a certain presage of the destruction of the chosen people. As then Jonah 				perceived as in a mirror the near ruin of Israel, he on this account grieved, if we believe Jerome: but this notion is extremely frivolous; for, immediately after, God reproved Jonah. What then will the foolish and puerile apology of Jerome avail the Prophet, since God has declared that he acted perversely in grieving? Nay, the dullness of Jerome is thus become evident; (thus indeed do I speak of a man, who, though learned and laborious, has yet deprived himself of that praise, which otherwise 				he might have justly earned.) His wayward disposition everywhere betrayed itself; and he is evidently disproved in this very context, where Jonah shows clearly that the cause of his grief was another, even this, &#8212; that he was unwilling to be deemed a false or a lying prophet: hence was his great grief and his bitterness. And this we see, had God not expressed his mind, was unjust and inconsistent with every reason.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.i-p11"></A>We may then conclude that Jonah was influenced by false zeal when he could not with resignation bear that the city of Nineveh should have been delivered from destruction: and he also himself amplifies the greatness of his sin. He might have said, in one word, that it displeased Jonah; but not satisfied with this simple form, he adds, that he felt great displeasure or grief; and he afterwards adds, that he was very angry. Though the 				beginning may not have been wrong, yet excess was sinful. But he confesses that there was excess, and want of moderation in his grief: since then he accuses himself in plain words what good is it, by false and invented pretenses, to cover what we clearly see cannot be excused? But that it may be more evident why the deliverance of the city of Nineveh displeased Jonah, let us go on with the context &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.4.ii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption26"><a name="iii.4.ii-p1"></A><a name="iii.4.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#002">Jonah 4:2</a><a name="iii.4.ii-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iii.4.ii-p2"></A><b>2.</b> And he prayed unto the Lord, and said, I pray thee, O Lord, <i>was</i> not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou <i>art</i> a gracious God, and 					 merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iii.4.ii-p3"></A><b>2. </b>Et oravit ad Jehovam et dixit, Obsecro Jehova, an non hic sermo meus, quum adhuc essem in terra mea? Propterea festinavi fugere in Tharsis, quia noveram quod tu sis Deus propitius (vel, plenus gratiae,) et misericors, tardus ad iram, multus clementia, et qui poenitentia duceris super malo.</p>

<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.4.ii-p5"></A><a name="iii.4.ii-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.ii-p6"></A>It seems by no means befitting that Jonah should have said here that he prayed; for prayer ought to be calm; but he confesses that his mind was in a state of excitement. As then anger was burning within the Prophet, how could he come before God and utter a suitable prayer? And further, what is the end of praying, but to confess that whatever good is to be obtained resides in God, and is to be sought humbly from him? But Jonah here, on the 				contrary, expostulates and clamors against God; for he seems in a manner to be contending that he had a just reason for his flight, and also that God ought not to have pardoned the Ninevites. He then accuses God, that he might free himself from every blame. But all this is foreign and remote from what is required in prayer. How then must we understand this passage, in which he says that he prayed? My answer is &#8212; that the faithful often in a disturbed state of mind approach God with a desire to 				pray, and that their prayers are not wholly rejected, though they are not altogether approved and accepted. And hence also it appears more evident how the works of the godly are regarded by God, though they are sprinkled with many stains. Whenever the Papists read that any work has pleased God, they imagine that all was perfection and cleanness: but there is no work which is not infected with some pollution, unless it be purified by a free pardon. This I say is evident to us in this prayer, 				which was not so rejected by God, as though it retained not the character of prayer: and yet it is certain that Jonah was by no means rightly influenced when he prayed so clamorously, finding fault, as it were, with God, and retaining still some portion of his own obstinacy; for he boasted of his flight. But this flight, as we have stated, was a proof of manifest rebellion, since, by shaking off the yoke, he despised the call of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.ii-p7"></A>We must therefore acknowledge that there was some piety in this prayer of Jonah, as well as many faults. It was an act of piety that he addressed his complaints to God. For though hypocrites may pray to God, they yet are wholly averse to him, and freely give vent to their bitterness against God: but Jonah, while he here complains, and observes no moderation, but is carried away by a blind and perverse impulse, is yet prepared to submit to 				God, as we shall hereafter see. This is the reason why he says that he prayed: for he would not have been ashamed to confess any grievous sin of which he might have been conscious. He did not then extenuate his fault by using the word prayer as hypocrites are wont to do, who ever set up some pretenses or veils when they seek to cover their own baseness: such was not the object of Jonah. When therefore he says that he prayed, he declares generally that he did not so speak against God, but that 				he still retained some seed of piety and obedience in his heart. <i>Jonah</i> then <i>prayed.</i> Hence it follows, as I have before stated, that many of the prayers of the saints are sinful, (<i>vitiosas</i> &#8212; faulty) which, when tried by the right rule, deserve to be rejected. But the Lord, according to his own mercy, pardons their defects so that these confused and turbulent prayers yet retain their title and honor.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.ii-p8"></A>Now he says, <i>I pray thee, Jehovah is not this what I said?</i> Here Jonah openly declares why he bore so ill the deliverance of Nineveh from destruction, because he was thus found to have been false and lying. But it may seem strange that the Prophet had more regard for his own reputation than for the glory of God; for in this 				especially shines forth the glory of God, that he is reconcilable as soon as men return to the right way, and that he offers himself to them as a father. Ought then Jonah to have preferred his own honor to the glory of God? I answer, &#8212; that the Prophet was not so devoted to himself, but that a concern for the glory of God held the first place in his soul; this is certain. For he connected, and justly so, his own ministry with the glory of God; as it proceeded from his authority. When Jonah 				entered Nineveh, he cried not as a private man, but avowed that he was sent by God. Now if the preaching of Jonah is found to be false, reproach will recoil on the author of his call, even on God. Jonah then no doubt could not bear that the name of God should be exposed to the reproaches of the Gentiles, as though he had spoken dissemblingly, now opening hell, then heaven: and there is nothing so contrary to the glory of God as such a dissimulation. We hence see why Jonah was seized with so 				much grief; he did not regard himself; but as he saw that an occasion would be given to ungodly blasphemers, if God changed his purpose, or if he did not appear consistent with his word, he felt much grieved.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.ii-p9"></A>But however specious this reason may be, we yet learn of how much avail are good intentions with God. Whatever good intention can be imagined, it was certainly a good intention in Jonah, worthy of some praise, that he preferred dying a hundred times rather than to hear these reproachful blasphemies &#8212; that the word of God was a mere sport, that his threatening were no better than fables, that God made this and that pretense, and transformed 				himself into various characters. This was certainly the very best intention, if it be estimated by our judgment. But we shall presently see that it was condemned by the mouth of God himself. Let us hence learn not to arrogate to ourselves judgment in matters which exceed our capacities, but to subject our minds to God, and to seek of him the spirit of wisdom. For whence was it that Jonah so fretted against God, except that he burned with a desire for his glory? But his zeal was inconsiderate, 				for he would be himself the judge and arbitrator, while, on the contrary, he ought to have subjected himself altogether to God. And the same rule ought to be observed also by us. When we see many things happening through a Divine interposition, that is, through the secret providence of God, and things which expose his name to the blasphemies of the ungodly, we ought indeed to feel grief; but in the meantime let us ask of the Lord to turn at length these shameful reproaches to his own glory; and 				let us by no means raise an uproar, as many do, who immediately begin to contend with God, when things are otherwise ordered than what they wish or think to be useful. Let us learn by the example of Jonah not to measure God&#8217;s judgments by our own wisdom, but to wait until he turns darkness into light. And at the same time let us learn to obey his commands, to follow his call without any disputing: though heaven and earth oppose us, though many things occur which may tend to avert us from the 				right course, let us yet continue in this resolution, &#8212; that nothing is better for us than to obey God, and to go on in the way which he points out to us.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.ii-p10"></A>But by saying that he <i>hastened to go to Tarshish,</i> he does not altogether excuse his flight; but he now more clearly explains, that he did not shun trouble or labor, that he did not run away from a contest or danger, but that he only avoided his call, because he felt a concern for the glory of God. The 				import, then, of Jonah&#8217;s words is, &#8212; that he makes God here, as it were, his witness and judge, that he did not withdraw himself from obedience to God through fear of danger, or through idleness, or through a rebellious spirit, or through any other evil motive, but only because he was unwilling that his holy name should be profaned, and would not of his own accord be the minister of that preaching, which would be the occasion of opening the mouth of ungodly and profane men, and of making them 				to laugh at God himself. Since then I cannot hope, he says, for any other issue to my preaching than to make the Gentiles to deride God, yea, and to revile his holy name, as though he were false and deceitful, I chose rather to flee to Tarshish. Then Jonah does not here altogether clear himself; for otherwise that chastisement, by which he ought to have been thoroughly subdued, must have failed in its effect. He had been lately restored from the deep, and shall we say that he now so extols 				himself against God, that he wishes to appear wholly free from every blame? This certainly would be very strange: but, as I have said, he declares to God, that he fled at the beginning for no other reason, but because he did not expect any good fruit from his preaching, but, on the contrary, feared what now seemed to take place, &#8212; that God&#8217;s name would be ridiculed.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.ii-p11"></A>For he immediately adds,<i> For I know that thou art a God full of grace, and merciful, slow to wrath, </i>etc. It is a wonder that Jonah withdrew from his lawful call; for he knew that God was merciful, and there is no stronger stimulant than this to stir us on, when God is pleased to use our labor: and we know that no one can with 				alacrity render service to God except he be allured by his paternal kindness. Hence no one will be a willing Prophet or Teacher, except he is persuaded that God is merciful. Jonah then seems here to reason very absurdly when he says, that he withdrew himself from his office, because he knew that God was merciful. But how did he know this? By the law of God; for the passage is taken from <a name="iii.4.ii-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#001">Ex 33:1</a><a name="iii.4.ii-p11.1"></A>, where is described that remarkable and memorable vision, in which God offered to Moses a view of himself: and there was then exhibited to the holy Prophet, as it were, a living representation of God, and there is no passage in the law which expresses God&#8217;s nature more to the life; for God was then pleased to make himself known in a familiar way to his servant.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.ii-p12"></A>As then Jonah had been instructed in the doctrine of the law, how could he discharge the office of a Prophet among his own people? And why did not this knowledge discourage his mind, when he was called to the office of a Teacher? It is then certain that this ought to be confined to the sort of preaching, such as we have before explained. Jonah would not have shrunk from God&#8217;s command, had he been sent to the Ninevites to 				teach what he had been ordered to do among the chosen people. Had then a message been committed to Jonah, to set forth a gracious and merciful God to the Ninevites, he would not have hesitated a moment to offer his service. But as this express threatening, <i>Nineveh shall be destroyed</i>, was given him in charge, he became confounded, and sought at length to flee away rather than to execute such a command. 				Why so? Because he thus reasoned with himself, &#8220;I am to denounce a near ruin on the Ninevites; why does God command me to do this, except to invite these wretched men to repentance? Now if they repent, will not God be instantly ready to forgive them? He would otherwise deny his own nature: God cannot be unlike himself, he cannot put off that disposition of which he has once testified to Moses. Since God, then, is reconcilable, if the Ninevites will return to the right way and flee to him, he 				will instantly embrace them: thus I shall be found to be false in my preaching.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.ii-p13"></A>We now then perceive how this passage of Jonah is to be understood, when he says that he fled beyond the sea, at least that he attempted to do so, because he knew that God was gracious; for he would not have deprived God of his service, had not this contrariety disturbed and discouraged his mind, &#8220;What! I shall go there as God&#8217;s ambassador, in a short time I shall be discovered to be a liar: will not this reproach be cast on the name of 				God himself? It is therefore better for me to be silent, than that God, the founder of my call, should be ridiculed.&#8221; We see that Jonah had a distinct regard to that sort of preaching which we have already referred to. And it hence appears that Jonah gave to the Ninevites more than he thought; for he supposed that he was sent by God, only that the Ninevites might know that they were to be destroyed: but he brought deliverance to them; and this indeed he partly suspected or knew before; for he 				retained this truth &#8212; that God cannot divest himself of his mercy, for he remains ever the same. But when he went forth to execute the duty enjoined on him he certainly had nothing to expect but the entire ruin of the city Nineveh. God in the meantime employed his ministry for a better end and purpose. There is indeed no doubt but that he exhorted the Ninevites to repentance; but his own heart was as it were closed up, so that he could not allow them the mercy of God. We hence see that Jonah 				was seized with perplexities, so that he could not offer deliverance to the Ninevites, and it was yet offered them by God through his instrumentality.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.ii-p14"></A>We now then understand how God often works by his servants; for he leads them as the blind by his own hand where they think not. Thus, when he stirs up any one of us, we are sometimes <a name="iii.4.ii-p14.1"></A>&#8000;&#955;&#953;&#947;&#8057;&#960;&#8055;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#953; &#8212; very weak in faith; we think that our labor will be useless and without any fruit, or at least attended with small success. But 				the Lord will let us see what we could not have expected. Such was the case with Jonah; for when he came to Nineveh, he had no other object but to testify respecting the destruction of the city; but the Lord was pleased to make him the minister of salvation. God then honored with remarkable success the teaching of Jonah, while he was unworthy of so great an honor; for, as we have already said, he closed up in a manner every access to the blessing of God. We now then apprehend the meaning of 				this passage, in which Jonah says that he fled from the call of God, because he knew that God was ready to be gracious and merciful.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.ii-p15"></A>I come now to the great things which are said of God. <a name="iii.4.ii-p15.1"></A>&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503;, <i>chenun, </i>properly means a disposition to show favor, as though it was said that God is gratuitously benevolent; we express the same in our language by the terms, <i>benin, gratieux, 				debonnaire.</i> God then assumes to himself this character; and then he says,<i> merciful;</i> and he adds this that we may know that he is always ready to receive us, if indeed we come to him as to the fountain of goodness and mercy. But the words which follow express more clearly his mercy, and show how God is merciful, &#8212; even because he is abundant in compassion and slow to wrath. God then is inclined to kindness; and though men 				on whom he looks are unworthy, he is yet merciful; and this he expresses by the word <a name="iii.4.ii-p15.2"></A>&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1501;, <i>rechum</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.ii-p16"></A>It is at the same time necessary to add these two sentences that he is <i>abundant</i> in compassion and slow to wrath, &#8212; why so? For we ever seek in ourselves some cause for God&#8217;s favor; when we desire God to be kind to us, we inquire in ourselves why he ought to favor us: and when we find nothing, all the faith we before had respecting God&#8217;s grace at once vanishes. The Lord 				therefore does here recall us to himself, and testifies that he is kind and merciful, inasmuch as he is abundant in compassion; as though he said, &#8220;I have in myself a sufficient reason, why I should be accessible to you, and why I should receive you and show you favor.&#8221; Hence the goodness of God alone ought to be regarded by us, when we desire his mercy, and when we have need of pardon. It is as though he had said, that he is not influenced by any regard for our worthiness, and that it is not 				for merits that he is disposed to mercy when we have sinned, and that he receives us into favor; but that he does all this because his goodness is infinite and inexhaustible. And it is also added, that he is <i>slow to wrath</i>  This slowness to wrath proves that God provides for the salvation of mankind, even when he is provoked by their sins. Though miserable men provoke God daily 				against themselves, he yet continues to have a regard for their salvation. He is therefore slow to wrath, which means, that the Lord does not immediately execute such punishment as they deserve who thus provoke him. We now then see what is the import of these words.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.ii-p17"></A>Let us now return to this &#8212; that Jonah thrust himself from his office, because he knew that God was slow to wrath, and merciful, and full of grace: he even had recourse to this reasoning, &#8220;Either God will change his nature, or spare the Ninevites if they repent: and it may be that they will repent; and then my preaching will be found to be false; for God will not deny himself, but will afford an example of his goodness and mercy in 				forgiving this people.&#8221; We may again remark, that we act perversely, when we follow without discrimination our own zeal: it is indeed a blind fervor which then hurries us on. Though then a thousand inconsistencies meet us when God commands any thing, our eyes ought to be closed to them, and we ought ever to follow the course of our calling; for he will so regulate all events, that all things shall redound to his glory. It is not for us in such a case to be over-wise; but the best way is, to 				leave in God&#8217;s hand the issue of things. It becomes us indeed to fear and to feel concerned; but our anxiety ought, at the same time, to be in submission to God, so that it is enough for us to pray. This is the import of the whole.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.ii-p18"></A>Now as to what he says that God <i>repents of the evil,</i> we have already explained this: it means, that though God has already raised his hand, he will yet withdraw it, as soon as he sees any repentance in men; for evil here is to be taken for punishment. The Lord then, though he might 				justly inflict extreme punishment on men, yet suspends his judgment, and when they come to him in true penitence he is instantly pacified. This is God&#8217;s repentance; he is said to repent when he freely forgives whatever punishment or evil men have deserved whenever they loathe themselves.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">53</FONT></A>
 				 It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.4.iii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption26"><a name="iii.4.iii-p1"></A><a name="iii.4.iii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#003">Jonah 4:3</a><a name="iii.4.iii-p1.1"></A></p>

<p><a name="iii.4.iii-p3"></A><b>3. </b>Et tu Jehova, tolle, quaeso, animam meam a me; quia melius mori meum quam vivere.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="iii.4.iii-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.4.iii-p5"></A><a name="iii.4.iii-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.iii-p6"></A>We here see how angry Jonah was in his zeal: for this prayer cannot certainly be ascribed to his faith, as some think, who say that Jonah took a flight as it were in his soul to heaven, when he made this prayer, as though he dreaded not death, but having been divested of all fear, being free and disengaged, he presented himself to God. I do not think that the mind of Jonah was so heroic. There is indeed no doubt, as I 				have already said, but that he still retained some seed of piety; and this, I said, is sufficiently proved by the word prayer; for if Jonah had burst out in the strain of one in despair, it would not have been a prayer. Since then he prayed by thus speaking, it follows that it was not the cry of despair, but of too much displeasure, which Jonah did not restrain. In short, this prayer proceeded from a pious and holy zeal; but Jonah sinned as to its measure or excess; for he had in a manner 				forgotten himself, when <i>he preferred death to life</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.iii-p7"></A><i>Thou Jehovah,</i> he says, <i>take me away.</i> He was first not free from blame in hastily wishing to die; for it is not in our power to quit this world; but we ought with submissive minds to continue in it as long as God 				keeps us in the station in which we are placed. whosoever, then, hastens to death with so great an ardor no doubt offends God. Paul knew that death was desirable in his case, (<a name="iii.4.iii-p7.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#022">Php 1:22</a><a name="iii.4.iii-p7.1"></A>;) but when he understood that his labor would be useful to the Church, he was contented with his lot, and preferred the will of God to his own will; and thus he was prepared both to live and 				to die, as it seemed good to God. It was otherwise with Jonah, &#8220;Now,&#8221; he says, &#8220;take away my life.&#8221; This was one fault; but the other was, &#8212; that he wished to die, because God spared the Ninevites. Though he was touched with some grief, he ought not yet to have gone so far as this, or rather to rush on, so as to desire death on account of the weariness of his life.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.iii-p8"></A>But we hence learn to what extremes men are carried, when once they give loose reins to inconsiderate zeal. The holy Prophet Jonah, who had been lately tamed and subdued by so heavy a chastisements is now seized and carried away by a desire to die, &#8212; and why? because he thought that it was hard that he denounced destruction on the Ninevites, and that still their city remained safe. This example ought to check us, that we express not too 				boldly our opinion respecting the doings of God, but, on the contrary, hold our thoughts captive, lest any presumption of this kind be manifested by us; for there is none of us who does not condemn Jonah, as also he condemned himself; for he does not here narrate his own praise, but means to show how foolishly he had judged of God&#8217;s work. Jonah then confesses his own folly; and therefore his experience is to us an evidence that there is nothing more preposterous than for us to settle this or 				that according to our own wisdom, since this is alone true wisdom, to submit ourselves wholly to the will of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.iii-p9"></A>Now if any one raises a question here, &#8212; whether it is lawful to desire death; the answer may be briefly this, &#8212; that death is not to be desired on account of the weariness of life; this is one thing: and by the weariness of life I understand that state of mind, when either poverty, or want, or disgrace, or any such thing, renders life hateful to us: but if any, through weariness on account of his sins and hatred to them, regrets his 				delay on earth, and can adopt the language of Paul,</p>  			 
<p class="Center"><a name="iii.4.iii-p10"></A>&#8220;Miserable am I, who will free me from the body of this death!&#8221; (<a name="iii.4.iii-p10.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#024">Ro 7:24</a><a name="iii.4.iii-p10.1"></A>,)</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.iii-p11"></A> &#8212; he entertains a holy and pious wish, provided the submission, to which I have referred, be added so that this feeling may not break forth in opposition to the will of God; but that he who has such a desire may still suffer himself to be detained by his hand as long as he pleases. And further, when any one wishes to die, because he fears for himself as to the future, or dreads to undergo any evil, he also struggles against God; and 				such was the fault of Jonah; for he says that death was better to him than life, &#8212; and why? because the Lord had spared the Ninevites. We hence see how he was blinded, yea, carried away by a mad impulse to desire death.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.iii-p12"></A>Let us then learn so to love this life as to be prepared to lay it down whenever the Lord pleases: let us also learn to desire death, but so as to live to the Lord, and to proceed in the race set before use until he himself lead us to its end.

<p><a name="iii.4.iv-p9"></A>There is no doubt but that God by thus reproving Jonah condemns his intemperate warmth. But since God alone is a fit judge of man&#8217;s conduct, there is no reason for us to boast that we are influenced by good intentions; for there is nothing more fallacious than our own balances. When therefore we weigh facts, deeds, and thoughts by our own judgment, we deceive ourselves. Were any disposed rhetorically to defend the conduct of Jonah, he 				might certainly muster up many specious pretenses; and were any one inclined to adduce excuses for Jonah, he might be made to appear to us altogether innocent: but though the whole world absolved him, what would it avail, since he was condemned by the mouth of God himself, who alone, as I have already stated, is the judge? We ought then to feel assured, that Jonah had done foolishly, even if no reason was apparent to us; for the authority of the Supreme Judge ought to be more than 				sufficient.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.iv-p10"></A>Now God expressly condemns his wrath. Had Jonah modestly expostulated, and unburdened his griefs into the bosom of God, it would have been excusable; though his ardor would not have been free from blame, it might yet have been borne with. But now, when he is angry, it is past endurance; for wrath, as one says, is but short madness; and then it blinds the perceptions of men, it disturbs all the faculties of the soul. God then does not here 				in a slight manner condemn Jonah, but he shows how grievously he had fallen by allowing himself to become thus angry. We must at the same time remember, that Jonah had sinned not only by giving way to anger; he might have sinned, as we have said, without being angry. But God by this circumstance &#8212; that he thus became turbulent, enhances his sin. And it is certainly a most unseemly thing, when a mean creature rises up against God, and in a boisterous spirit contends with him: this is monstrous; 				and Jonah was in this state of mind.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.iv-p11"></A>We hence see why an express mention is made of his anger, &#8212; God thus intended to bring conviction home to Jonah, that he might no more seek evasions. Had he simply said, &#8220;Why! how is it that thou dost not leave to me the supreme right of judging? If such is my will, why dost not thou submissively acknowledge that what I do is rightly done? Is it thy privilege to be so wise, as to dictate laws to me, or to correct my decisions?&#8221; &#8212; had the 				Lord thus spoken, there might have remained still some excuse; Jonah might have said, &#8220;Lord, I cannot restrain my grief, when I see thy name so profaned by unseemly reproaches; can I witness this with a calm mind?&#8221; He might thus have still sought some coverings for his grief; but when the Lord brought forward his anger, he must have been necessarily silenced; for what could be found to excuse Jonah, when he thus perversely rebelled, as I have said, against God, his Judge and Maker? We now then 				understand why God expressly declares that Jonah did not do well in being thus angry.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.iv-p12"></A>But I wonder how it came into Jerome&#8217;s mind to say that Jonah is not here reproved by the Lord, but that something of an indifferent kind is mentioned. He was indeed a person who was by nature a sophister, (cavillator &#8212; a caviler;) and thus he wantonly trifled with the work of falsifying Scripture; he made no conscience of perverting passages of holy writ. As, for instance, when he writes about marriage, he says that they do not ill who 				marry, and yet that they do not well. What a sophistry is this, and how vapid! So also on this place, &#8220;God,&#8221; he says, &#8220;does not condemn Jonah, neither did he intend to reprove his sin; but, on the contrary, Jonah brings before us here the person of Christ, who sought death that the whole world might be saved; for when alive he could not do good to his own nation, he could not save his own kindred; he therefore preferred to devote himself and his life for the redemption of the world.&#8221; These are 				mere puerilities; and thus the whole meaning of this passage, as we clearly see, is distorted. But the question is more emphatical than if God had simply said, &#8220;Thou hast sinned by being thus angry;&#8221; for an affirmative sentence has not so much force as that which is in the form of a question.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.iv-p13"></A>God then not only declares as a Judge that Jonah had not done well, but he also draws from him his own confession, as though he said, &#8220;Though thou art a judge in thine own cause, thou can&#8217;t not yet make a cover for thy passion, for thou art beyond measure angry.&#8221; For when he says <a name="iii.4.iv-p13.1"></A>&#1500;&#1498;, <i>la</i>k, with, or, <i>in thyself, </i>he reminds Jonah to examine his own heart, as though he said, &#8220;Look on thyself as in a mirror: thou wilt see what a boisterous sea is thy soul, being seized as thou art by so mad a rage.&#8221; We now then perceive not only the plain sense of the passage, but also the emphasis, which is contained in the questions which Jerome has turned to a meaning wholly contrary. I will not proceed 				farther;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">55</FONT></A>

<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.4.vii-p5"></A><a name="iii.4.vii-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.vii-p6"></A>It may be here doubted whether Jonah had waited till the forty days had passed, and whether that time had arrived; for if we say that he went out of the city before the fortieth day, another question arises, how could he have known what would be? for we have not yet found that he had been informed by any oracular communication. But the words which we have noticed intimate that it was then known by the event itself, that God had spared the 				city from destruction; for in the last lecture it was said, that God had repented of the evil he had declared and had not done it. It hence appears that Jonah had not gone out of the city until the forty days had passed. But there comes again another question, what need had he to sit near the city, for it was evident enough that the purpose of God had changed, or at least that the sentence Jonah had pronounced was changed? he ought not then to have seated himself near the city as though he was 				doubtful.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.vii-p7"></A>But I am inclined to adopt the conjecture, that Jonah went out after the fortieth day, for the words seem to countenance it. With regard to the question, why he yet doubted the event, when time seemed to have proved it, the answer may be readily given: though indeed the forty days had passed, yet Jonah stood as it were perplexed, because he could not as yet feel assured that what he had before proclaimed according to God&#8217;s command would 				be without its effect. I therefore doubt not but that Jonah was held perplexed by this thought, &#8220;Thou hast declared nothing rashly; how can it then be, that what God wished to be proclaimed by his own command and in his own name, should be now in vain, with no corresponding effect?&#8221; Since then Jonah had respect to God&#8217;s command, he could not immediately extricate himself from his doubts. This then was the cause why he sat waiting: it was, because he thought that though God&#8217;s vengeance was 				suspended, his preaching would not yet be in vain, but that the ruin of the city was at hand. This therefore was the reason why he still waited after the prefixed time, as though the event was still doubtful.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.vii-p8"></A>Now that this may be more evident, let us bear in mind that the purpose of God was hidden, so that Jonah understood not all the parts of his vocation. God, then, when he threatened ruin to the Ninevites, designed to speak conditionally: for what could have been the benefit of the word, unless this condition was added, &#8212; that the Ninevites, if they repented, should be saved? There would otherwise have been no need of a Prophet; the Lord 				might have executed the judgment which the Ninevites deserved, had he not intended to regard their salvation. If any one objects by saying that a preacher was sent to render them inexcusable, &#8212; this would have been unusual; for God had executed all his other judgments without any previous denunciation, I mean, with regard to heathen nations: it was the peculiar privilege of the Church that the Prophets ever denounced the punishments which were at hand; but to other nations God made it known 				that he was their Judge, though he did not send Prophets to warn them. There was then included a condition, with regard to God&#8217;s purpose, when he commanded the Ninevites to be terrified by so express a declaration. But Jonah was, so to speak, too literal a teacher; for he did not include what he ought to have done, &#8212; that there was room for repentance, and that the city would be saved, if the Ninevites repented of their wickedness. Since then Jonah had learned only one half of his office, it is 				no wonder that his mind was still in doubt, and could not feel assured as to the issue; for he had nothing but the event, God had not yet made known to him what he would do. Let us now proceed &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.4.viii"></A>

<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.4.viii-p9"></A><a name="iii.4.viii-p9.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.viii-p10"></A>Before I proceed to treat on the contents of these verses, I will say a few things on the word <a name="iii.4.viii-p10.1"></A>&#1511;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, <i>kikiun</i>; for there were formerly some disputes respecting this word. Some render it, a gourd; (<i>eucurbitam</i>) 				others think it to have been a cucumber. Free conjectures are commonly made respecting obscure and unknown things. However, the first rendering has been the received one: and Augustine says, that a tumult arose in some church, when the Bishop rend the new interpretation of Jerome, who said that it was the ivy. Those men were certainly thoughtless and foolish who were so offended for a matter so trifling; for they ought to have more carefully inquired which version was the best and most correct. 				And Augustine did not act so very wisely in this affair; for superstition so possessed him, that he was unwilling that the received version of the Old Testament should be changed. He indeed willingly allowed Jerome to translate the New Testament from the Greek original; but he would not have the Old Testament to be touched; for he entertained a suspicion of the Jews, &#8212; that as they were the most inveterate enemies of the faith, they would have tried to falsify the Law and the Prophets. As then 				Augustine had this suspicion, he preferred retaining the common version. And Jerome relates that he was traduced at Rome, because he had rendered it ivy instead of gourd; but he answered Augustine in a very severe and almost an angry manner; and he inveighed in high displeasure against some Cornelius and another by the name of Asinius Polio, who had accused him at Rome as one guilty of sacrilege, because he had changed this word. I cannot allege in excuse, that they peevishly rejected what was 				probable. But as to the thing itself, I would rather retain in this place the word gourd, or cucumber, than to cause any disturbance by a thing of no moment. Jerome himself confesses, that it was not ivy; for he says, that it was a kind of a shrub, and that it grows everywhere in Syria; he says that it was a shrub supported by its own stem, which is not the case with ivy; for the ivy, except it cleaves to a wall or to a tree, creeps on the ground. It could not then have been the ivy; and he 				ought not to have so translated it. He excuses himself and says, that if he had put down the Hebrew word, many would have dreamt it to have been a beast or a serpent. He therefore wished to put down something that was known. But he might also have caused many doubts: &#8220;Why! ivy is said to have ascended over the head of Jonah, and to have afforded him a shade; how could this have been?&#8221; Now I wonder why Jerome says in one place that the shrub was called in his time Cicion in the Syrian language; 				and he says in another place in his Commentaries, that it was called in the same language Elkeroa; which we see to be wholly different from the word <a name="iii.4.viii-p10.2"></A>&#1511;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, <i>kikiun</i>. Now when he answered Augustine I doubt not but that he dissembled; for he knew that Augustine did not understand Hebrew: he therefore trifled with him as with a child, 				because he was ignorant. It seems to have been a new gloss, I know not what, invented at the time for his own convenience: I doubt not but that he at the moment formed the word, as there is some affinity between <a name="iii.4.viii-p10.3"></A>&#1511;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, <i>kikiun,</i> and cicion. However it may have been, whether it was a gourd or a shrub, it is not necessary to dispute much 				how it could have grown so soon into so great a size. Jerome says, that it was a shrub with many leaves, and that it grew to the size of a vine. Be it so; but this shrub grows not in one day, nor in two, nor in three days.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.viii-p11"></A>It must have therefore been something extraordinary. Neither the ivy, nor the gourd, nor any shrub, nor any tree, could have grown so quickly as to afford a cover to the head of Jonah: nor did this shrub alone give shelter to Jonah&#8217;s head; for it is more probable, that it was derived also from the booth which he had made for himself. Jonah then not only sheltered himself under the shrub, but had the booth as an additional cover, when he 				was not sufficiently defended from the heat of the sun. Hence God added this shrub to the shade afforded by the booth: for in those regions, as we know, the sun is very hot; and further, it was, as we shall see, an extraordinary heat.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.viii-p12"></A>I wished to say thus much of the word ivy; and I have spoken more than I intended; but as there have been contentions formerly on the subject, I wished to notice what may be satisfactory even to curious readers. I come now to what is contained in this passage.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.viii-p13"></A>Jonah tells us that a gourds or a cucumber, or an ivy, was prepared by the Lord. There is no doubt but that this shrub grew in a manner unusual, that it might be a cover to the booth of Jonah. So I view the passage. But God, we know, approaches nature, whenever he does anything beyond what nature is: this is not indeed always the case; but we generally find that God so works, as that he exceeds the course of nature, 				and yet from nature he does not wholly depart. For when in the desert he intended to collect together a great quantity of quails, that he might give meat to the people, he raised wind from the east, (<a name="iii.4.viii-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#031">Nu 11:31</a><a name="iii.4.viii-p13.1"></A>.) How often the winds blew without bringing such an abundance of birds? It was therefore a miracle: but yet God did not wholly cast aside the assistance of nature; hence 				he made use of the wind; and yet the wind could not of itself bring these birds. So also in this place, God had chosen, I have no doubt, a herb, which soon ascended to a great height, and yet far surpassed the usual course of nature. In this sense, then, it is that God is said to have prepared the <a name="iii.4.viii-p13.2"></A>&#1511;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, <i>kikiun,</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">56</FONT></A>
 				 and to have made it to ascend over Jonah&#8217;s head, that it might be for a shade to his head and free him from his distress.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.4.viii-p15"></A><a name="iii.4.viii-p15.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.viii-p16"></A>But it is said afterwards that <i>a worm was prepared</i>. We see here also, that what seemed to happen by chance was yet directed by the hidden providence of God. Should any one say, that what is here narrated does not commonly happen, but what once happened; to this I answer, &#8212; that though God then designed to exhibit a wonderful 				example, worthy of being remembered, it is yet ever true that the gnawing even of worms are directed by the counsel of God, so that neither a herb nor a tree withers independently of his purpose. The same truth is declared by Christ when he says, that without the Father&#8217;s appointment the sparrows fall not on the ground, (<a name="iii.4.viii-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029">Mt 10:29</a><a name="iii.4.viii-p16.1"></A>.) Thus much as to the worm.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.4.viii-p17"></A><a name="iii.4.viii-p17.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.viii-p18"></A>It is now added, <i>that when the sun arose the day following, a wind was prepared.</i> We here learn the same thing, &#8212; that winds do not of themselves rise, or by chance, but are stirred up by a Divine power. There may indeed be found causes in nature why now the air is tranquil, and then it is disturbed by winds; but God&#8217;s purpose 				regulates all these intermediate causes; so that this is ever true &#8212; that nature is not some blind impulse, but a law settled by the will of God. God then ever regulates by his own counsel and hand whatever happens. The only difference is, that his works which flow in the usual course have the name of nature; and they are miracles and retain not the name of nature, when God changes their wonted course; but yet they all proceed from God as their author. Therefore with regard to this wind, we 				must understand that it was not usual or common; and yet that winds are daily no less stirred up by God&#8217;s providence than this wind of which Jonah speaks. But God wrought then, so to speak, beyond the usual course of nature, though he daily preserves the regular order of nature itself.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.viii-p19"></A>Let us now see why this whole narrative has been set down. Jonah confesses that he <i>rejoiced with great joy,</i> when he was sheltered from the extreme heat of the sun: but when the shrub withered, he was touched with so much grief that he wished to die. There is nothing superfluous here; for Jonah shows, 				with regard to his joy and his grief, how tender he was and how susceptible of both. Jonah here confesses his own sensibility, first by saying that he greatly rejoiced, and then by saying that he was so much grieved for the withered shrub, that through weariness of life he instantly desired death. There is then here an ingenuous confession of weakness; for Jonah in a very simple manner has mentioned both his joy and his grief. But he has distinctly expressed the vehemence of both feelings, that 				we might know that he was led away by his strong emotions, so that in the least things he was either inflamed with anger, or elated with joy beyond any bounds. This then was the case with him in his grief as well as in his joy. But he does not say that he prayed as before; but he adopts the word <a name="iii.4.viii-p19.1"></A>&#1513;&#1488;&#1500;, <i>shal</i>, which signifies to desire or 				wish. <i>He desired, </i>it is said,<i> for his soul that he might die.</i> It is hence probable that Jonah was so overwhelmed with grief that he did not lift up his heart to God; and yet we see that he was not neglected by God: for it immediately follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.4.ix"></A>

He often looks on us from behind; that is, though we think that he has forgotten us, he yet observes how we go on, that he may in due time afford help: and hence it is that he recovers and raises up the falling, before we perceive that he is near. This was his manner with Jonah, when he began to address him: for, as we have said, grief had so 				oppressed the mind of the holy Prophets that it could no longer be raised up to God. Hence he desired to die; and still God did not forsake him. This was no common example of the invaluable mercy of God, with which he favors his own people, even when they precipitate themselves into ruin: such was the case with Jonah, who rushed headlong into a state of despair, and cared not for any remedy. God then did not wait until he was sought, but anticipated miserable Jonah, who was now seeking 				destruction to himself.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.ix-p7"></A>He says, <i>Doest thou well that thou art thus angry for the gourd?</i> As though he had said, that he was too violently disturbed for a matter so trifling. And we must ever bear that in mind, of which we spoke more fully yesterday, &#8212; that God did not merely reprove his servant, because he did not patiently bear the withering of the gourd 				&#8212; what then? but because he became angry; for in anger there is ever an excess. Since then Jonah was thus grieved beyond measure, and without any restraint, it was justly condemned by God as a fault. I will now not repeat what I said yesterday respecting the enhancing of the crime, inasmuch as Jonah not only murmured on account of the withering of the shrub, but also disregarded himself, and boiled over with displeasure beyond all due limits.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.ix-p8"></A>And the answer of Jonah confirms this,<i> I do well,</i> he says,<i> in being angry even to death.</i> We here see how obstinately the holy Prophet repelled the admonition of God, by which he ought to have been restored to a right 				mind. He was not ignorant that God spoke. Why then was he not smitten with shame? Why was he not moved by the authority of the speaker, so as immediately to repress the fierceness of his mind? But thus it commonly happens, when the minds of men are once blinded by some wrong feeling; though the Lord may thunder and fulminate from heaven, they will not hear, at least they will not cease violently to resist, as Jonah does here. Since then we find such an example of perverseness in this holy man, 				how much more ought every one of us to fear? Let us hence learn to repress in time our feelings, and instantly at the beginning to bridle them, lest if they should burst forth to a greater extent, we become at last altogether obstinate. I do well, he says, in being angry even to death. God charged his servant Jonah with the vice of anger; Jonah now indulges himself in his own madness, so that he says that desperation is not a vice: I do not sin, he says, though I am despairing; though I abandon 				myself to death as with mad fury, I do not yet sin.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.ix-p9"></A>Who could have thought that the holy Prophet could have been brought into this state of mind? But let us be reminded, as I have already said, by this remarkable example, how furious and unreasonable are the passions of our flesh. There is, therefore, nothing better than to restrain them, before they gather more strength than they ought; for when any one feeds his vices, this obstinacy and hardness always follow. But to be angry, or to be 				in a fume even to death, is to feel such a weariness of life, as to give ourselves up of our own accord to death. It was not indeed the design of Jonah to lay violent hands on himself; but though he abstained from violence, he yet, as to the purpose of his mind, procured death to himself; for he submitted not to God, but was carried away by a blind impulse, so that he wished to throw away his life. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.4.x"></A>

<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.4.x-p7"></A><a name="iii.4.x-p7.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.x-p8"></A>Here God explains the design he had in suddenly raising up the gourd, and then in causing it to perish or wither through the gnawing of a worm; it was to teach Jonah that misconduct towards the Ninevites was very inhuman. Though we find that the holy Prophet had become a prey to dreadful feelings, yet God, by this exhibition, does in a manner remind him of his folly; for, under the representation of a gourd, he shows how unkindly he desired 				the destruction of so populous a city as Nineveh.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.x-p9"></A>Yet this comparison may appear ill suited for the purpose. Jonah felt sorry for the gourd, but he only regarded himself: hence he was displeased, because the relief with which he was pleased was taken away from him. As then this inconvenience had driven Jonah to anger, the similitude may not seem appropriate when God thus reasons, Thou wouldest spare the gourd, should I not spare this great city? Nay, but he was not concerned for the gourd 				itself: if all the gourds of the world withered, he would not have been touched with any grief; but as he felt the greatest danger being scorched by the extreme heat of the sun, it was on this account that he was angry. To this I answer, &#8212; that though Jonah consulted his own advantage, yet this similitude is most suitable: for God preserves men for the purpose for which he has designed them. Jonah grieved for the withering of the gourd, because he was deprived of its shade: and God does not 				create men in vain; it is then no wonder that he wishes them to be saved. We hence see that Jonah was not unsuitably taught by this representation, how inhumanely he conducted himself towards the Ninevites. He was certainly but one individual; since then he made such an account of himself and the gourd only, how was it that he cast aside all care for so great and so populous a city? Ought not this to have come to his mind, that it was no wonder that God, the Creator and Father, had a care for 				so many thousands of men? Though indeed the Ninevites were alienated from God, yet as they were men, God, as he is the Father of the whole human race, acknowledged them as his own, at least to such an extent as to give them the common light of day, and other blessings of earthly life. We now then understand the import of this comparison: &#8220;Thou wouldest spare,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the gourd, and should I not spare this great city?&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.x-p10"></A>It hence appears how frivolous is the gloss of Jerome, &#8212; that Jonah was not angry on account of the deliverance of the city, but because he saw that his own nation would, through its means, be destroyed: for God repeats again that Jonah&#8217;s feeling was quite different, &#8212; that he bore with indignity the deliverance of the city from ruin. And less to be endured it is still, that Jerome excuses Jonah by saying that he nobly 				and courageously answered God, that he had not sinned in <i>being angry even to death.</i> That man dared, without any shame or discernment, to invent a pretense that he might excuse so disgraceful an obstinacy. But it is enough for us to understand the real meaning of the Prophet. Here then he shows, according to God&#8217;s representation, that his cruelty was justly condemned for having anxiously desired the 				destruction of a populous city.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.x-p11"></A>But we ought to notice all the parts of the similitudes when he says, <i>Thou wouldest have spared, </i>etc. There is an emphasis in the pronoun <a name="iii.4.x-p11.1"></A>&#1488;&#1514;&#1492;, <i>ate,</i> 				for God compares himself with Jonah; &#8220;Who art thou? Doubtless a mortal man is not so inclined to mercy as I am. But thou takest to thyself this right &#8212; to desire to spare the gourd, even thou who art made of clay. Now this gourd is not thy work, <i>thou hast not labored for it,</i> it has not proceeded from thy culture or toil; and further, <i>thou hast not raised it up,</i> and further still, <i>it was the daughter of a night, and in one night it perished;</i> it was an evanescent shrub or herb. If then thou regardest the nature of the gourd, if thou regardest thyself, and joinest together all the other circumstances, thou wilt find no reason for thy hot 				displeasure. But should not I, who am God, in whose hand are all things, whose prerogative and whose constant practice it is mercifully to bear with men &#8212; should not I spare them, though they were worthy of destruction? and should not I spare a great city? The matter here is not concerning a little plant, but a large number of people. And, in the last place, it is a city,<i> in which there are a hundred and twenty thousand men who know not how 				to distinguish between their right hand and the left.&#8221;</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.x-p12"></A>We now then see how emphatical are all the parts of this comparison. And though God&#8217;s design was to reprove the foolish and sinful grief of Jonah, we may yet further collect a general instruction by reasoning in this manner, &#8220;We feel for one another, and so nature inclines us, and yet we are wicked and cruel. If then men are inclined to mercy through some hidden impulse of nature, what may not be 				hoped from the inconceivable goodness of God, who is the Creator of the whole world, and the Father of us all? and will not he, who is the fountain of all goodness and mercy spare us?&#8221;</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.4.x-p13"></A><a name="iii.4.x-p13.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.x-p14"></A>Now as to the number, Jonah mentions here twelve times ten thousand men, and that is as we have said, one hundred and twenty thousand. God shows here how paternally he cares for mankind. Every one of us is cherished by him with singular care: but yet he records here a large number, that it might be more manifest that he so much regards mankind that he will not inconsiderately fulminate against any one nation. And what he adds, that they 				could not distinguish between the right hand and the left, is to be referred, I have no doubt, to their age; and this opinion has been almost universally received. Some one, however has expressed a fear lest the city should be made too large by allowing such a number of men: he has, therefore, promiscuously included the old, as well as those of middle age and infants. He says that these could not distinguish between the right hand and the left, because they had not been taught in the school of 				God, nor understood the difference between right and wrong; for the unbelieving, as we know, went astray in their errors. But this view is too strained; and besides, there is no reason for this comment; for that city, we know, was not only like some great cities, many of which are at this day in Europe, but it surpassed most of the principal cities at this day. We know that in Paris there are more than four hundred thousand souls: the same is the case with other cities. I therefore reject this 				comment, as though Jonah was here speaking of all the Ninevites. But God, on the contrary, intended to show, that though there was the justest reason for destroying entirely the whole city, there were yet other reasons which justified the suspension of so dreadful a vengeance; for many infants were there who had not, by their own transgressions, deserved such a destruction.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.x-p15"></A>God then shows here to Jonah that he had been carried away by his own merciless zeal. Though his zeal, as it has been said, arose from a good principle, yet Jonah was influenced by a feeling far too vehement. This God proved, by sparing so many infants hitherto innocent. And to infants he adds the brute animals. Oxen were certainly superior to shrubs. If Jonah justly grieved for one withering shrub, it was far more deplorable and cruel for 				so many innocent animals to perish. We hence see how apposite are all the parts of this similitude, to make Jonah to loathe his folly, and to be ashamed of it; for he had attempted to frustrate the secret purpose of God, and in a manner to overrule it by his own will, so that the Ninevites might not be spared, who yet labored by true repentance to anticipate the divine judgment.</p>  <a name="iii.4.xi"></A>  			 
<p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld29"><a name="iii.4.xi-p1"></A>Prayer.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.4.xi-p2"></A>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast, in various ways, testified, and daily continues to testify, how dear and precious to thee are mankind, and as we enjoy daily so many and so remarkable proofs of thy goodness and favor, &#8212; O grant, that we may learn to rely wholly on thy goodness, many examples of which thou settest before us, and which thou wouldest have us continually to experience, that we may not only pass through our earthly course, but 				also confidently aspire to the hope of that blessed and celestial life which is laid up for us in heaven, through Christ our Lord.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.4.i-p4"></A> The two verbs used here are evidently to be construed as impersonals. The most literal rendering would be thus, &#8212;</p>  						
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent01"><a name="iii.4.i-p5"></A>&#8220;And it was an evil to Jonah, a great evil; <br> 						  and wrath was to him,&#8221; or, &#8220;he was wroth.&#8221;</p>  						
<p><a name="iii.4.i-p6"></A>Evil means often grief or distress, and so it is here: but the verb <a name="iii.4.i-p6.1"></A>&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;, properly rendered in our version, &#8220;very angry,&#8221; seldom if ever, means grief. It is sometimes rendered &#8220;grieved&#8221; in our version; but in every instance that I can find, it means the grief of anger or displeasure. It occurs twice in <a name="iii.4.i-p6.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#000">Genesis 4</a><a name="iii.4.i-p6.2"></A>, in 						  exactly similar form as we find it here, followed by the preposition <a name="iii.4.i-p6.3"></A>&#1500;, <a name="iii.4.i-p6.4"></A>&#1493;&#1497;&#1495;&#1512; &#1500;&#1511;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1488;&#1491;, &#8220;and Cain was very wroth,&#8221; or literally, &#8220;and there was wrath to Cain very much,&#8221; version 5. And then in the following verse we have the like form, <a name="iii.4.i-p6.5"></A>&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; &#1495;&#1512;&#1492; &#1500;&#1491;, &#8220;Why are thou wroth?&#8221; or, &#8220;Why is wrath to thee?&#8221; The phrase here is, <a name="iii.4.i-p6.6"></A>&#1500;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1495;&#1512;, &#8220;and wrath was to him.&#8221; What seems to have made some commentators to change wrath or anger to grief, as has been a desire to screen the guilt of Jonah. But the whole narrative clearly shows that he was so displeased as to be 						  angry. His pettish request to die is a sufficient proof of this. Calvin was not a man to trifle with the word of God for this purpose, or for any other: nor was he at a loss to account for the sin of Jonah, without denying his piety. It is only shallow Christians, and such as have only the outward shell of religion, who are reduced to this dilemma.</p>  						
<p><a name="iii.4.i-p7"></A><i>Marckius</i> very justly observes, &#8220;That though all the works of God are altogether blameless (<a name="iii.4.i-p7.1"></A><i>irreprehensibilia</i>,) yet there is hardly anything which is not sometimes blamed by our most foolish flesh (<a name="iii.4.i-p7.2"></A><i>carne</i> <i>insipientissima</i>.) Thus not only the world, God&#8217;s enemy, sins against him; but even his own people, 						  who honor him, openly show, one while, that his severity, and at another time that his kindness, displease them, as though they were not befitting.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 					 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.4.iv-p4"></A> This clause has been variously rendered. The original words are these, <a name="iii.4.iv-p4.1"></A>&#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1496;&#1489; &#1495;&#1512;&#1492; &#1500;&#1498;. It is not to the point to say, as <i>Dr. Henderson</i> does, that the first word is sometimes rendered adverbially, as meaning &#8220;greatly,&#8221; etc.; for in other places it is rendered as a verb, 						  &#8220;to be good,&#8221; or &#8220;to do good.&#8221; It depends wholly on the form of the sentence what rendering is the most suitable. Both the construction of the words and the connection of the passage seem to favor the literal rendering. The first <a name="iii.4.iv-p4.2"></A>&#1492; is the <a name="iii.4.iv-p4.3"></A><i>an</i> of the Latin, <i>whether,</i> it is an interrogation. Then the rendering is, &#8220;Whether it is good,&#8221; or, &#8220;Is that good?&#8221; Jonah had said before that it was &#8220;good&#8221; for him to die rather than to live; for it is the same word in a different form &#8212; <a name="iii.4.iv-p4.4"></A>&#1499;&#1497; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; &#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1497;, &#8220;for good my death rather than my life.&#8221; Then the question to him is, &#8220;Is it good <i>that</i> thou art wrathful,&#8221; or literally, &#8220;<i>that</i> wrath is to thee?&#8221; the verb <a name="iii.4.iv-p4.5"></A>&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;, as in the first verse, is to be construed impersonally.</p>  						
<p><a name="iii.4.iv-p5"></A>The rendering, &#8220;Art thou much vexed?&#8221; is pointless and vapid. It is indeed countenanced by the Septuagint; but we must remember that on some points there is a wrong leaning in that version, and this is one of those points. As in the case of Jerome and the early Fathers, there was a disposition and an attempt to lessen and even to obliterate all the faults and defects of the ancient saints, so it was evidently with the authors of this 						  version. Superstition and Pharisaism must have all their saints perfect, while the word of God represents all true saints as imperfect in the present state, but aiming at, and longing for, perfection, and fully expecting to enjoy it hereafter.</p>  						
<p><a name="iii.4.iv-p6"></A>The version of <i>Newcome</i> is, &#8220;Doest thou well that <i>thine anger</i> is kindled?&#8221; Kindling or heat, that is, of anger or wrath, is the ideal meaning of the verb. <i>Junius</i> and <i>Tremelius,</i> as well as <i>Dathius,</i> consider that anger, and not grief is meant. <i>Dr. Adam Clarke&#8217;s</i> version is this, &#8220;Is anger good for thee?&#8221; which is certainly very literal; or, as the verb is in the causative mood, it might be rendered, 						  &#8220;Can anger do good to thee?&#8221; It may be doubted whether here, and in the ninth verse, where the same phrase twice occurs, this rendering is the most obvious and natural. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 					 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.4.viii-p14"></A> Much has been written on the character of this plant. Modern critics have pretended to determine that it was the <a name="iii.4.viii-p14.1"></A><i>Ricinus</i><i>,</i> commonly called <a name="iii.4.viii-p14.2"></A><i>Palma Christi</i>. It matters not what it was: its growth was doubtless miraculous. It may have been an indigenous plant, it may have been such a plant as never grew 					 before or after. Two things are evident &#8212; God prepared it, and prepared it to shelter Jonah. In a translation it would have been better either to retain the original name, or to give it the general name of a plant or shrub. To call it a gourd, an ivy, or a cucumber, is to convey an incorrect idea. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>
