<p><a name="iii.1.ii-p8"></A>As I have before observed, Jonah seems here indirectly to intimate,  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>
 				that he had been previously called to the office of a teacher; for it is the same as though he had said, that he framed this history as a part of his ordinary function. The word of God then was not for the first time communicated to Jonah, when he was sent to Nineveh; but it pleased God, when he was already a Prophet, to employ him among other nations. It might have been then, that he was sent to Nineveh, that the Lord, being wearied with the obstinacy of his own people, might 				afford an example of pious docility on the part of a heathen and uncircumcised nation, in order to render the Israelites more inexcusable. They made a profession of true religion, they boasted that they were a holy people; circumcision was also to them a symbol and a pledge of God&#8217;s covenant; yet they despised all the Prophets, so that their teaching among them was wholly useless. It is then probable that this Prophet was taken away from them, that the Ninevites by their example might increase 				the sin of Israel, for in three days they turned to God, after Jonah had preached to them: but among the Israelites and their kindred he had, during a long time, effected nothing, when yet his authority had been sufficiently ratified, and thus, as we have already said, in their favor: for Jonah had predicted, that the kingdom of Israel would as yet stand; and however much they deserved to perish, yet the Lord fulfilled what he had promised by the mouth at his servant. They ought then to have 				embraced his doctrine, not only because it was divine, but especially because the Lord had been pleased to show his love to them.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.ii-p15"></A>I do not indeed doubt, but that the ingratitude of the people was in this manner arraigned, since the Ninevites repented at the preaching of Jonah, and that for a short time, while the Israelites ever hardened themselves in their obstinacy. And hence some have refinedly expounded that passage in <a name="iii.1.ii-p15.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039">Mt 12:39-41</a><a name="iii.1.ii-p15.1"></A>, &#8216;This perverse generation seeketh 				a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the Prophet,&#8217; as though this intimated, that the Gospel was to be preached to the Gentiles, inasmuch as Jonah was taken away from his own nation, and was given as a teacher to foreign and heathen nations. They therefore suppose, that we are to understand this as a prophecy respecting the future call of the Gentiles, as though Christ had said, that he would hereafter go to the Gentiles, after having found the wickedness of the 				chosen people past recovery. But as Christ expressly applies this comparison, we ought not to draw his words here and there.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A>
 				He indeed confines the similitude to one particular thing, that is, &#8220;As Jonah had been three days in the whale&#8217;s bowels, so also he would be three days in the bowels of the earth;&#8221; as though he had said, that in this he would be like to Jonah, for he would be a Prophet brought to life again. And this was said designedly by Christ, because he saw that he was despised by the Jews, and that his labors were in vain: &#8220;Since ye now hear me not, and regard me as nothing, know that I shall 				be hereafter a new Prophet, even after my resurrection; so at length I shall begin to speak more effectually both to the Jews and to the Gentiles, as Jonah converted Nineveh, after having returned again to life.&#8221; This then is the simple meaning of the passage. Hence Jonah was not a type of Christ, because he was sent away unto the Gentiles, but because he returned to life again, after having for some time exercised his office as a Prophet among the people of Israel. They then who say that his 				going forth was a token of the call of the Gentiles, adduce indeed what is plausible, but it seems to be supported by no solid reason; for it was in fact an extraordinary thing. God, then, had not as yet openly showed what he would do at the coming of Christ. When Naaman the Syrian was converted to the faith, (<a name="iii.1.ii-p16.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#015">2Ki 5:15</a><a name="iii.1.ii-p16.2"></A>) and a few others, God changed nothing in his ordinary proceedings: for there ever 				existed the special call of the race of Abraham, and religion was ever confined within the ancient limits; and it remained ever true, that God had not done to other nations as he had to the Jews, for he had revealed to them his judgments, (<a name="iii.1.ii-p16.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#020">Ps 147:20</a><a name="iii.1.ii-p16.3"></A>.) It was therefore God&#8217;s will that the adoption of the race of Abraham should continue unaltered to the conning of Christ, so that the Jews might excel all 				other nations, and differ from them through a gratuitous privilege, as the holy and elect people of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.ii-p17"></A>Those who adopt the contrary opinion say, that the Ninevites were converted to the Lord without circumcision. This is true; but I know not whether that was a true and legitimate conversion, which is hereafter mentioned; and of this, the Lord being willing, I shall again speak more fully: but it seems more probable, that they were induced by the reproofs and threatening of the Prophet, suppliantly to deprecate the impending wrath of God: 				hence God once forgave them; what took place afterwards does not clearly appear. It is certainly not probable that the whole city was converted to the Lord: for soon after that city became exceedingly hostile both to the Israelites and the Jews; and the Church of God was by the Ninevites continually harassed with slaughters. Since it was so, there is certainly no reason to think, that they had really and from the heart repented. But I put off a full discussion of this subject until we come to 				another passage. Let us go on now with our text.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.1.ii-p18"></A><a name="iii.1.ii-p18.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.ii-p19"></A><i>Arise, go to Nineveh, to that great city.</i> Nineveh is called a great city, and not without reason; for it was in circumference, as heathen writers say, 400 stadia: and we shall see that Jonah was three whole days in going through the squares and streets of the city   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A>
 				. It hence follows, that it was a very large city, and this all allow. Profane writers call it Ninus, and say that it is a name derived from its founder; for it was Ninus, the son of Betas, who built it. But more correct is their opinion, who think that <a name="iii.1.ii-p21.1"></A>&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492; <i>Ninue, </i>is a Hebrew word: and hence what Herodotus 				and Diodorus, and others of the same class, say, is certainly fabulous, both as to the origin of the city and as to the whole progress of the kingdom, and their legends can easily be disproved by testimonies from holy Scripture. It is at the same time admitted by all, that Nineveh was a very large and a well fortified city. Babylon was afterwards built by Semiramis, who had been the wife of Betas: after her husband&#8217;s death she wished to show that she also excelled in mind and industry, and that 				she had wisdom above her sex. But with regard to the founder of Nineveh, it is certain that the city was first built by Asshur: whether it was enlarged by Ninus, I know not: this, then, I leave as uncertain; for I wish not to contend about what is doubtful. But it is certain, from what Moses has said, that the founder of this city was Asshur, (<a name="iii.1.ii-p21.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#011">Ge 10:11</a><a name="iii.1.ii-p21.2"></A>.)</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.ii-p22"></A>As to the largeness of the city, even if profane writers had not said a word, the testimony of Jonah ought to be sufficient to us. Now, since he is bidden to go and proceed to Nineveh, the Lord gives him some hope of success. He indeed wrought effectually by the hand of his servant, Nahum; who, though he continued at home, yet prophesied against the Ninevites; but with a different view, and for another end. For as the people were then 				miserably distressed, and saw the kingdom or monarchy of Assyria in a flourishing state, they must have despaired, had not some solace been afforded them. Hence Nahum showed that God would be a judge against the Ninevites; that though he for a time favored and spared them, there was yet impending over them the dreadful judgment of which he speaks. Nahum, then, was not given as a teacher to the Ninevites, but was only a proclaimer, that the Jews might strengthen their faith by this comfort &#8212; 				that they were not wholly rejected by the Lord, as he would some time avenge their wrongs. The case with Jonah was different: for he was sent to the city itself, to exhort the Ninevites to repent. Now the Lord, by speaking expressly of the largeness of the city, intended thus to prepare him with firmness, lest he should be frightened by the splendor, wealth, and power of that city: for we know how difficult it is to take in hand great and arduous undertakings, especially when we feel ourselves 				destitute of strength. When we have to do with many and powerful adversaries, we are not only debilitated, but our courage wholly vanishes away. Lest, then, the greatness of Nineveh should fill Jonah with terror, he is here prepared and armed with firmness. &#8220;<i>Go</i> then<i> to Nineveh, </i>and let not the power of that monarchy prevent thee to fulfill what I command thee; which is, to show to the Ninevites their sins, and to denounce on them destruction, if they repent not.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.ii-p23"></A>We now then understand why Nineveh was called<i> a great city:</i> for had it not been for the reason just stated, it would not have been necessary that this should have been said to Jonah. The Israelites, I doubt not, knew well that it was a large city, and also possessed of strength and of a large number of men: but the Lord intended to set before his servant what might have been a hindrance to him in the discharge of his office; 				<i>Go</i> then <i>to this great city.</i> In short, God designed in this way to try Jonah, whether he would prefer his command to all the hindrances of this world. And it is a genuine proof of obedience when we simply obey God, however numerous the obstacles which may meet us and may be suggested to our minds, and though no escape may appear to us; yea, when we follow God, as it were with closed eyes, wherever he may lead us, and doubt not but that he will add strength to us, and stretch forth 				also his hand, whenever need may require, to remove all our difficulties. It was then the Lord&#8217;s purpose to deal thus with Jonah; as though he had said to him, &#8220;remember who I am, and be content with my authority; for I have ready at hand all resources; when any thing stands in your way, rely on my power, and execute what I command thee.&#8221; This is the import of the passage. Whenever then God demands any service from us, and we at the same time see that what the discharge of our duty demands is 				either difficult or apparently impossible, let this come to our minds, &#8212; that there is not anything in the whole world which ought not to give way to God&#8217;s command: we shall then gather courage and confidence, nor will anything be able to call us away from our duty and a right course, though the whole world were fighting against God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.ii-p24"></A>It now follows<i>, Cry against her; for ascended has their wickedness before my presence.</i> Cry, he says, against her: it was an unpleasant undertaking to cry out against her immediately at the beginning. We indeed know that men take pride in their power: and as there was then but one 				monarchy in the world, the seat of which was at Nineveh, a teacher could hardly expect to obtain a patient hearing, though he excelled in gracefulness of manner, and had acquired reputation, and brought an agreeable message. But Jonah was a foreigner, one unknown, and destitute of authority; and still more, he was immediately to denounce destruction on the Ninevites, to cry aloud, to reprove, to make a vehement proclamation, to threaten. How difficult was all this? We hence see how hard a 				command it was when God charged his Prophet to cry against Nineveh.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.ii-p25"></A>It is now added, <i>For their wickedness has ascended to me.</i> By this clause God strengthens his servant Jonah; as though he said, &#8220;Thou wilt not, as an individual, have to contend with them, but I constitute thee as my herald, to summon them to my tribunal.&#8221; And no doubt it must have served much to animate Jonah, that he had not to 				deal with the Ninevites as an individual, but as the messenger of God: and it might also have had an influence on their minds, to know, that though no mortal inflicted punishment for their crimes, they yet could not escape the vengeance of God. This then is the reason why the Lord here declares that he would be the judge of Nineveh. And at the same time he reminds us, that though the Ninevites felicitated themselves, and also gained the plaudits of the whole world on account of their power, yet 				all this was of no moment, because their wickedness and iniquity had ascended into heaven. When therefore we are reproved, there is no reason that we should turn our eyes here and there towards men; we ought instantly to present ourselves to the scrutiny of God; nay, we ought ourselves to take in hand that voluntary examination which God requires. By so doing, we shall not feed our vices by foolishly deceiving ourselves, as hypocrites do, who ever look around them to the right hand and to the 				left, and never raise up their thoughts to heaven. Let us go on &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.1.iii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption26"><a name="iii.1.iii-p1"></A><a name="iii.1.iii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#003">Jonah 1:3</a><a name="iii.1.iii-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iii.1.iii-p2"></A><b>3.</b> But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iii.1.iii-p3"></A><b>3. </b>Et surrexit Jonas ad fugendum (ut fugeret) Tharsis a facie Jehovae, et descendit Japho, et invenit navem, quae transibat Tharsis, et dedit mercedem (hoc est, naulum pretium vecturae,) et descendit in eam, ut iret cum ipsis (nempe cum mercatoribus vel nautis) in Tharsis a conspectu Jehovae.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="iii.1.iii-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.1.iii-p5"></A><a name="iii.1.iii-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.iii-p6"></A>Jonah now relates how he sought hiding-places, that he might withdraw himself from the service of God; not that he deceived himself with such a gross notion, as that he would be no longer under the power of God, after having passed over the sea; but he intended to shun, as it were, the light of the present life, by proceeding to a foreign country. He was, no doubt, not only in a disturbed state of mind, when he formed such a purpose, but 				was utterly confused.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.iii-p7"></A>It may be asked, why Jonah thus avoided the command of God. The Jews, indulging in frigid trifles in divine things, say that he feared lest, when he came to Nineveh, he should be deprived of the prophetic spirit, as though he were not in the same danger by passing over the sea: this is very frivolous and puerile. And further, they blend things of no weight, when reasons sufficiently important present themselves to us.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.iii-p8"></A>It was first a new and unusual thing for Prophets to be drawn away from the chosen people, and sent to heathen nations. When Peter was sent to Cornelius, (<a name="iii.1.iii-p8.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#017">Ac 10:17</a><a name="iii.1.iii-p8.1"></A>,) though he had been instructed as to the future call of the Gentiles, he yet doubted, he hesitated until he was driven as it were forcibly by a vision. What then must have come to the mind 				of Jonah? If only on account of one man the mind of Peter was disquieted, so as to think it an illusion, when he was sent a teacher to Cornelius, what must Jonah have thought, when he was sent to a city so populous? Hence novelty, doubtless, must have violently shaken the courage of the holy Prophet, and induced him to retake himself elsewhere, as one destitute of understanding. Again, doubt might have had an influence on him: for how could he have hoped that a people, who were notorious for 				their licentiousness, would be converted? He had indeed before an experience of the hardness of the chosen people. He had been faithfully engaged in his office, he had omitted nothing to confirm the worship of God and true religion among the people of Israel: but he had effected but little; and yet the Jews had been called from the womb. What then could he hope, when the Lord removed him to Nineveh? for unbridled licentiousness ruled there; there was also there extreme blindness, they had no 				knowledge of divine worship; in a word, they were sunk in extreme darkness, and the devil in every way reigned there. Doubt then must have broken down the spirit of Jonah, so that he disobeyed the command of God. Still further, the weakness of the flesh must have hindered him from following his legitimate call: &#8220;What then? even this, &#8212; I must go to the chief city of that monarchy, which at this day treads under its feet the whole earth; I must go there, a man obscure and despised; and then I 				must proclaim a message that will excite the greatest hatred, and instantly kindle the minds of men into rage; and what must I say to the Ninevites? &#8216;Ye are wicked men, God can no longer endure your impiety; there is, therefore, a dreadful vengeance near at hand.&#8217; How shall I be received?&#8221; Jonah then, being still surrounded by the infirmities of the flesh, must have given way to fear, which dislodged the love of obedience.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.iii-p9"></A>And I have no doubt, in my own mind, but that Jonah discussed these things within himself, for he was not a log of wood. And doubtless it was not to no purpose, as I have already said, that he mentions that the city was great. God indeed sought to remove what might prove an hindrance, but Jonah, on the other hand, reasoned thus, &#8212; &#8220;I see that I am to have a fierce contest; nay, that such a number of people will fall on me, enough to 				overwhelm me a hundred times, as the Lord has not in vain foretold me that the city is great.&#8221; And though he might have had some hope, if they had been chastised, that they would give God his due honor; yet he confesses, that this hindrance came to his mind, which prevented him to proceed in the course of his calling. Hence doubt, as well as the fear of the flesh made Jonah to stumble, and novelty also, as I have already said, must have perplexed him; so that he preferred to go down, as it 				were, to the grave, than to undertake an office which apparently had no reason in its favor. For why were the Prophets sent, except to effect something by their labor, and to bring forth some fruit? but of this Jonah had no hope. Some authority was also allowed the Prophets, at least they were allowed the liberty of teaching; but Jonah thought that all entrance was closed up against him: and still more, Jonah thought that he was opposing the covenant of the Lord, who had chosen one people only; 				and he also thought that he was, as it were, fixed to his own land, when he was appointed a Teacher in his own country; he therefore could not remove elsewhere without feeling a great repugnance.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.iii-p10"></A>I hence think, that Jonah disobeyed the command of God, partly because the weakness of the flesh was an hindrance, partly because of the novelty of the message, and partly because he despaired of fruit, or of success to his teaching.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.iii-p11"></A>But he doubtless grievously transgressed: for the first rule, as to all our actions, is to follow the call of God. Though one may excel in heroic virtues, yet all his virtues are mere fumes, which shine before the eyes of men, except the object be to obey God. The call of God then, as I have said, holds the first place as to the conduct of men; and unless we lay this foundation, we do like him who would build a house in the air. 				Disordered then will be the whole course of our life, except God presides over and guides us, and raises up over us, as it were, his own banners. As then Jonah subverted the first and the only firm foundation of a right conduct, what could have remained for him? There is then no reason for us to extenuate his fault, for he could not have sinned more grievously than by forsaking God, in having refused to obey his call: it was, as it were to shake off the yoke; and this he confesses himself.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.iii-p12"></A>They therefore very childishly write who wish to be his apologists, since he twice condemns himself &#8212; <i>Jonah rose up to flee from the presence of Jehovah </i>&#8212;<i> to go unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah.</i> Why does he the second time 				repeat, from the presence of Jehovah? He meant, no doubt, to express here more distinctly his fault: and the repetition is indeed very emphatical: and it also proves clearly that it was not a slight offense, when Jonah retook himself elsewhere when he was sent to Nineveh. He could not indeed have departed from the Lord, for God fills heaven and earth; and, as I have said already, he was not fascinated by so gross an error as to think, that when he became a fugitive, he was beyond the reach of 				God&#8217;s hand. What then is to flee from the face of Jehovah, except it be that which he here confesses, that he fled from the presence of God, as though he wished, like runaway servants, to reject the government of God? Since then Jonah was carried away by this violent temptation, there is no reason why we should now try, by some vain and frivolous pretenses, to excuse his sin. This is one thing.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.iii-p13"></A>With regard to the word <i>Tharsis,</i> or Tharsisa, I doubt not but that it means Cilicia. There are those who think that it is the city Tarsus; but they are mistaken, for it is the name of a country. They are also mistaken who translate it, Sea; for Jonah intended not only to go to sea, but also to pass over into Cilicia, which is opposite to the Syrian Sea. But the Jews called that the Sea of Tarshish, as it appears from many 				passages, because there was very frequent sailing to that place. As then that transmarine country was more known to them than any other, and as they carried there their merchandise, and in their turn purchased their goods, they called that the Sea of Tarshish, as it is well known, as being near it.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.iii-p14"></A>Jonah then intended to flee into Cilicia, when the Lord would have sent him to Nineveh. It is said that he <i>rose up to flee,</i> and then, that he <i>went down to Joppa,</i> that he <i>found there a ship,</i> which was passing over to Tarshish, that he <i>paid the fare,</i> that he <i>went down</i> into the ship,<i> to go with</i> them into Cilicia:   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A>
 				 now by all those expressions Jonah intimates that he was wholly fixed in his purpose, and that it was necessary that he should have been brought back by a strong hand; for he was touched by no repentance during his journey. Many things may indeed come to our minds when the call of God appears to us too burdensome. There is none of us, when service is to be performed to God, who does not roll this and that in his mind: &#8220;What will be the issue? how wilt thou reach 				the place where thou expectest to be? See what dangers await thee.&#8221; For Satan always comes forth, whenever we resolve to obey God; but we are to struggle in this case, and then repel what we see to be contrary to our calling. But Jonah shows that he was obstinately fixed in his purpose of fleeing: for he not only intended to go into Tarshish, but he actually went down to the city Joppa, which was nigh to Judea; and, therefore some think that Tarshish was Africa; but this is strained. Others 				divine it to be Thunetus or Carthage, as though indeed these cities were built at that time; but men are very bold in dreaming. But what need of giving a new meaning to this word against the most common usage of Scriptures when it is evident enough that Tarshish is Cilicia?</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.iii-p17"></A>Now, when Jonah went down to Joppa, it was evident that he intended immediately to migrate from the land of Judah, and to pass over the sea: but by saying that he <i>paid the fare,</i> that he <i>went down</i> into the ship, 				that he might <i>go,</i> &#8212; by this gradual progress, he sets before us, as I have said, more fully his own perverseness; so that he admits that he not only resolutely purposed to reject the call of God, but that he also confirmed himself in it: and though there were many things to be done, which might have sometimes forced him to stand still, he yet constantly followed where his perverse and blind impulse led him. There is no doubt then, but that 				Jonah, in these distinct words sets himself forth as a fugitive, not only by one act, but by many acts.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.iii-p18"></A>Now, as to his flight, we must bear in mind what I have before said &#8212; that all flee away from the presence of God, who do not willingly obey his commandments; not that they can depart farther from him, but they seek, as far as they can, to confine God within narrow limits, and to exempt themselves from being subject to his power. No one indeed openly confesses this; yet the fact itself shows, that no one withdraws himself from obedience 				to God&#8217;s commands without seeking to diminish and, as it were, to take from him his power, so that he may no longer rule. Whosoever, then, do not willingly subject themselves to God, it is the same as though they would turn their backs on him and reject his authority that they may no more be under his power and dominion.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.iii-p19"></A>It is deserving of notice, that as Jonah represents himself as guilty before the whole world, so he intended by his example to show how great and detestable a sin it is, not to submit to the commands of God, and not to undertake whatever he enjoins, but to evade his authority. That he might then enhance the atrocity of his sin, he shows by his own example that we cannot rebel against God, without seeking, under some pretense or another 				to thrust him from his throne, and, at the same time, to confine him within certain limits that he may not include heaven and earth within his empire.</p>  <a name="iii.1.iv"></A>

<p><a name="iii.1.iv-p2"></A>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast not sent a Jonah to us, when alienated from every hope of salvation, but hast given thy Son to be our Teacher, clearly to show to us the way of salvation, and not only to call us to repentance by threatening and terrors, but also kindly to allure us to the hope of eternal life, and to be a pledge of thy paternal love, &#8212; O grant, that we may not reject so remarkable a favor offered to us, but willingly and from 				the heart obey thee; and though the condition which thou settest before us in thy Gospel may seem hard, and though the bearing of the cross is bitter to our flesh, yet may we never shun to obey thee, but present ourselves to thee as a sacrifice; and having overcome all the hindrances of this world, may we thus proceed in the course of our holy calling, until we be at length gathered into thy celestial kingdom, under the guidance of Christ thy Son, our Lord. Amen.</p>

<p><a name="iii.1.vi-p6"></A>Jonah declares here how he had been, as it were, by force brought back by the Lord, when he tried to flee away from his presence. He then says that a <i>tempest arose</i> <i>in the sea;</i> but he at the same time tells us, that 				this tempest did not arise by chance, as ungodly men are wont to say, who ascribe everything that happens to fortune. God, he says, <i>sent a strong wind on the sea.</i> Some give this renderings God raised up, deriving the verb from <a name="iii.1.vi-p6.1"></A>&#1504;&#1496;&#1500;, <i>nuthel;</i> but others derive it more correctly from 				<a name="iii.1.vi-p6.2"></A>&#1496;&#1493;&#1500;, <i>tul</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A>
 				, and we shall presently meet with the same word in the fifth verse. Now as to what took place, he says that there was so great a tempest, that the ship was not far from being broken. When he says, &#8216;The ship thought to be broken   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A>
 				 the expression corresponds with the idiom of our language, <a name="iii.1.vi-p8.2"></A><i>la navire cuidoit perir</i>  But some take the ship for the passengers or the sailors; but this is strained; and we know that our common language agrees in many of its phrases with the Hebrew.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.vi-p9"></A>Jonah then meant, that a tempest arose, not by chance, but by the certain purpose of God, so that being overtaken on the sea, he acknowledged that he had been deceived when he thought that he could flee away from God&#8217;s presence by passing over the sea. Though indeed the Prophet speaks here only of one tempest, we may yet hence generally gather, that no storms, nor any changes in the air, which produce rain or stir up tempests on the sea, 				happen by chance, but that heaven and earth are so regulated by a Divine power, that nothing takes place without being foreseen and decreed. But if any one objects, and says that it does not harmonize with reason, that, for the fault of one man, so many suffered shipwreck, or were tossed here and there by the storm: the ready answer to this is, &#8212; that though God had a regard only, in a special manner, to the case of Jonah, yet there were hidden reasons why he night justly involve others in the 				same danger. It is probable that many were then sailing; it was not one ship only that was on that sea, since there were so many harbors and so many islands. But though the Lord may involve many men in the same punishment, when he especially intends to pursue only one man, yet there is never wanting a reason why he might not call before his tribunal any one of us, even such as appear the most innocent. And the Lord works wonderfully, while ruling over men. It would be therefore preposterous to 				measure his operations by our wisdom; for God can so punish one man, as to humble some at the same time, and to chastise others for their various sins, and also to try their patience. Thus then is the mouth of ungodly men stopped, that they may not clamor against God, when he so executes his judgments as not to comport with the judgment of our flesh. But this point I shall presently discuss more at large: there are indeed everywhere in Scripture, instances in which God inflicted punishment on a 				whole people, when yet one man only had sinned. But when some murmur and plead that they are innocent, there is ever to be found a reason why God cannot be viewed as dealing cruelly with them; nay, were he pleased, he might justly treat them with much greater severity: in a word, though God may appear to deal severely with men, he yet really spares them, and treats them with indulgence.

<p><a name="iii.1.vii-p6"></A>This narrative, in which Jonah relates in order so many circumstances, is not without its use; for, as we shall presently see, he intended to set forth his own insensibility, and to lay it before us as painted before our eyes: and the comparison, which is implied in the circumstances, greatly illustrates the supine and almost brutal security of Jonah.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.vii-p7"></A>He says first that <i>the mariners</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A>
 				 <i>were afraid,</i> and then, that each <i>cried,</i> that is, <i>to his god</i> and that they <i>cast out into the sea the lading of the ship.</i> As then they were all so concerned, 				was it not marvelous that Jonah, on whose account the sea was stormy, was asleep? Others were busy, they ran here and there in the ship, and spoiled themselves of their goods, that they might reach the shore in safety: they indeed chose to strip themselves of all they had rather than to perish; they also cried to their gods. Jonah cared for nothing, nay, he lay asleep: but whence came such a carelessness as this, except that he was not only become torpid, but that he seemed also to have been 				deprived of all reason and common feeling? There is no doubt then but that Jonah, in order to show this to have been the case, has here enumerated so many circumstances.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.vii-p9"></A>He says that the <i>mariners were afraid.</i> We indeed know that sailors are not usually frightened by small or common storms; for they are a hardy race of men, and they are the less afraid, because they daily see various commotions in the air. When, therefore, he says that the sailors were afraid, we hence gather that it was not a 				moderate tempest, for such does not thus terrify men accustomed by long expert once to all sorts of storms: they, then, who had been previously hardened, were disquieted with fear. He afterwards adds, that <i>they cried, each of them to his god.</i> Jonah certainly ought not to have slept so soundly, but that he might rouse himself at almost any moment, for he carried in his heart his own executioner, as he 				knew that he was a fugitive: for we have said before, that it was not a slight offense for Jonah to withdraw himself from the presence of God; he despised his call, and, as far as he could, cast off the yoke, so as not to obey God. Seeing, then, that Jonah was ill at ease with himself, ought he not to have trembled, even while asleep? But while others cried to their false gods, he either despised, or at least neglected the true God, to whom he knew he was disobedient, and against whom he 				rebelled. This is the point of the comparison, or of the antithesis. But we at the same time see, how in dangers men are constrained to call on God. Though, indeed, there is a certain impression by nature on the hearts of men as to God, so that every one, willing or unwilling, is conscious that there is some Supreme Being; we yet by our wickedness smother this light, which ought to shine within us. We indeed gladly cast away all cares and anxieties; for we wish to live at ease, and tranquillity 				is the chief good of men. Hence it comes, that all desire to live without fear and without care; and hence we all naturally seek quietness. Yet this quietness generates contempt. Hence then it is, that hardly any religion appears in the world, when God leaves us in an undisturbed condition. Fear constrains us, however unwilling, to come to God. False indeed is what is said, that fear is the cause of religion, and that it was the first reason why men thought that there were gods: this notion is 				indeed wholly inconsistent with common sense and experience. But religion, which has become nearly extinct, or at least covered over in the hearts of men, is stirred up by dangers. Of this Jonah gives a remarkable instance, when he says that the sailors <i>cried, each of them to his god</i>  We know how barbarous is this race of men; they are disposed to shake off every sense of 				religion; they indeed drive away every fear, and deride God himself as long as they may. Hence that they cried to God, it was no doubt what necessity forced them to do. And here we may learn, how useful it is for us to be disquieted by fear; for while we are safe, torpidity, as it is well known, soon creeps over us. Since, then, hardly any one of himself comes to God, we have need of goads; and God sharply pricks us, when he brings any danger, so as to constrain us to tremble. But in this way, 				as I have already said, he stimulates us; for we see that all would go astray, and even perish in their thoughtlessness, were he not to draw them back, even against their own will.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.vii-p10"></A>But Jonah does not simply say, that each cried to God, but he adds, <i>to his own god. </i>As, then, this passage teaches, that men are constrained by necessity to seek God, we also, on the other hand, it shows, that men go astray in seeking God, except they are directed by celestial truth, and also by the Spirit of God. There is then some right desire in men, but it goes astray; for none will keep the right way except the Lord directs 				them, as it has been said, both by his word and his Spirit. Both these particulars we learn from the words of the Prophet: The sailors <i>feared;</i> men hardy and almost iron-hearted, who, like the Cyclops, despised God, &#8212; these, he says, were <i>afraid;</i> and they also cried to God; but they did not cry by the guidance of faith; hence it was, that every one cried to his own god.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.vii-p11"></A>When we read this, let it first come to our minds that there is no hope until God constrains us, as it were, by force; but we ought to anticipate extreme necessity by seeking him willingly. For what did it avail the sailors and other passengers, to call once on God? It is indeed probable that, shortly after, they relapsed into their former ungodly indifference; after having been freed from their danger, they probably despised God, and 				all religion was regarded by them with contempt. And so it commonly happens as to ungodly men, who never obey God except when they are constrained. Let therefore every one of us offer himself willingly to God, even now when we are in no danger, and enjoy full quietness. For if we think, that any pretext for thoughtlessness, or for error, or for ignorance, will serve as an excuse, we are greatly deceived; for no excuse can be admitted, since experience teaches us, that there is naturally 				implanted in all some knowledge of God, and that these truths are engraven on our hearts, that God governs our life, &#8212; that he alone can remove us by death, &#8212; that it is his peculiar office to aid and help us. For how was it that these sailors cried? Had they any new teacher who preached to them about religion, and who regularly taught them that God was the deliverer of mankind? By no means: but these truths, as I have said, had been by nature impressed on their hearts. While the sea was 				tranquil, none of them called on their god; but danger roused them from their drowsiness. But it is hence sufficiently evident, that whatever excuses they may pretend, who ascribe not to God his glory, they are all frivolous; for there is no need of any law, there is no need of any Scripture, in short, there is no need of any teaching, to enable men to know, that this life is in the hand of God, that deliverance is to be sought from him alone, and that nothing, as we have said, ought to be 				looked for from any other quarter: for invocation proves that men have this conviction respecting God; and invocation comes from nothing else but from some hidden instinct, and indeed from the guidance and teaching of nature, (<a name="iii.1.vii-p11.1"></A><i>duce ac magistra natura</i>) This is one thing.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.vii-p12"></A>But let us also learn from this passage, that when God is sought by us, we ought not to trust to our own understanding; for we shall in that case immediately go astray. God then must be supplicated to guide us by his word, otherwise every one will fall off into his own superstitions; as we here see, that each cried to his own god. The Prophet also reminds us that multiplicity of gods is no modern invention; for mankind, since the fall of 				Adam, have ever been prone to falsehood and vanity. We know how much corruption must occupy our minds, when every one invents for himself hideous and monstrous things. Since it is so, there is no wonder that superstitions have ever prevailed in the world; for the wit of man is the workshop of all errors. (<a name="iii.1.vii-p12.1"></A><i>quia ingenium hominis officina est omnium errorum</i>) And hence also we may learn what I have lately touched upon, &#8212; that 				nothing is worse for us than to follow the impulses of our flesh; for every one of himself advances in the way of error, even without being pushed on by another; and at the same time, as is commonly the case, men draw on one another.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.vii-p13"></A>He now adds, that the <i>wares were cast out,</i> that is, the lading of the ship; and we know that this is the last resource in shipwrecks; for men, to save their lives, will deprive themselves willingly of all their goods. We hence see how precious is life to man; for he will not hesitate to strip himself of all he has, that he may not lose his life. We indeed shun want, and many seek death because extreme poverty is intolerable to 				them; but when they come to some great danger, men ever prefer their life to all their possessions; for what are the good things of this world, but certain additions to our life? But Jonah tells us for another purpose that the ship was lightened, even for this, &#8212; that we may know that the tempest was no ordinary commotion, but that the sailors, apprehensive of approaching death, adopted this as the last resource.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.vii-p14"></A>Another clause follows: <i>Jonah had gone down into the sides</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A>
 				<i>,</i> or the side, <i>of the ship.</i> Jonah no doubt sought a retreat before the storm arose. As soon then as they sailed from the harbor, Jonah withdrew to some remote corner, that he might sleep there. But this was no excusable insensibility on his part, as he knew that he was a fugitive from the presence of God: he ought then to have been agitated by 				unceasing terrors; nay, he ought to have been to himself the taxer (<a name="iii.1.vii-p15.4"></A><i>exactor</i>) of anxiety. But it often so happens, that when any one has sought hiding-places, he brings on himself a stupor almost brutal; he thinks of nothing, he cares for nothing, he is anxious for nothing. Such then was the insensibility which possessed the soul of Jonah, when he went down to some recess in the ship, 				that he might there indulge himself in sleep. Since it thus happened to the holy Prophet, who of us ought not to fear for himself? Let us hence learn to remind ourselves often of God&#8217;s tribunal; and when our minds are seized with torpor, let us learn to stimulate and examine ourselves, lest God&#8217;s judgment overwhelm us while asleep. For what prevented ruin from wholly swallowing up Jonah, except the mercy of God, who pitied his servant, and watched for his safety even while he was asleep? Had 				not the Lord then exercised such care over Jonah, he must have perished.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.vii-p17"></A>We hence see that the Lord often cares for his people when they care not for themselves, and that he watches while they are asleep: but this ought not to serve to nourish our self-indulgence; for every one of us is already more indulgent to himself than he ought to be: but, on the contrary, this example of Jonah, whom we see to have been so near destruction, ought to excite and urge us, that when any of us has gone astray from his 				calling he may not lie secure in that state, but, on the contrary, run back immediately to God. And if God be not able to draw us back to himself without some violent means, let us at least follow in this respect the example of Jonah, which we shall in its own place notice. It follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.1.viii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption26"><a name="iii.1.viii-p1"></A><a name="iii.1.viii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#006">Jonah 1:6</a><a name="iii.1.viii-p1.1"></A></p>

<p><a name="iii.1.viii-p6"></A>Jonah relates here how he was reproved by the pilot or master of the ship   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A>
 				, inasmuch as he alone slept, while all the rest were in anxiety and fear. &#8220;What meanest thou, fast sleeper?&#8221; The pilot no doubt upbraids Jonah for his sleepiness, and reproves him for being almost void of all thought and reflection. <i>What meanest thou, fast sleeper</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A>
 				<i>,</i> he says; when thou sees all the rest smitten with alarm, how canst thou sleep? Is not this unnatural? <i>Rise,</i> then, and <i>call on thy God</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.viii-p9"></A>We see that where there is no rule of faith a liberty is commonly taken, so that every one goes astray here and there. Whence was it, that the pilot said to Jonah, <i>Call on thy God,</i> and that he did not confine him to any certain rule? Because it had been customary in all ages for men to be satisfied with some general 				apprehension of God; and then every one according to his own fancy formed a god for himself: nor could it have been otherwise, as I have said, while men were not restrained by any sacred bond. All agree as to this truth, that there is some God, and also that no dead idol can do anything, but that the world is governed by the providence and power of God, and further, that safety is to be sought from him. All this, has been received by the common consent of all; but when we come to particulars, 				then every one is in the dark; how God is to be sought they know not. Hence every one takes his own liberty: &#8220;For the sake of appeasing God I will then try this; this shall be my mode of securing his favor; the Lord will regard this service acceptable; in this way shall all my iniquity be expiated, that I may obtain favor with God.&#8221; Thus each invents for themselves some tortuous way to come to God; and then every one forms a god peculiar to himself. There can therefore be no stability nor 				consistency in men, unless they are joined together by some bond, even by some certain rule of religion, so that they may not vacillate, and not be in doubt as to what is right to be done, but be assured and certainly persuaded, that there is but one true God, and know what sort of God he is, and then understand the way by which he is to be sought.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.viii-p10"></A>We then learn from this passage, that there is an awful license taken in fictitious religions, and that all who are carried away by their fancy are involved in a labyrinth, so that men do nothing but weary and torment themselves in vain, when they seek God without understanding the right way. They indeed run with all their might, but they go farther and farther from God. But that they, at the same time, form in their 				minds an idea of some God, and that they agree on this great principle, is sufficiently evident from the second clause of this verse, <i>If so be that God will be Propitious to us. </i>Here the pilot confines not his discourse to the God of Jonah, but speaks simply of a God; for though the world by their differences divide God, and Jonah worshipped a God different from the rest, and, in short, there was almost an endless number of gods among the 				passengers, yet the pilot says, <i>If so be that God,</i> etc.: now then he acknowledges some Supreme God, though each of them had his own god. We hence see that what I have said is most true, &#8212; that this general truth has ever been received with the consent of all, &#8212; that the world is preserved by the providence of God, and hence that the life and safety of men are in his hand. But 				as they are very far removed from God, and not only creep slowly, but are also more inclined to turn to the earth than to look up to heaven, and are uncertain and ever change, so they seek gods which are nigh to them, and when they find none, they hesitate not to invent them.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.viii-p11"></A>We have elsewhere seen that the Holy Spirit uses this form of speaking, <i>If so be,</i> when no doubt, but difficulty alone is intended. It is however probable, that the pilot in this case was perplexed and doubtful, as it is usual with ungodly men, and that he could determine nothing certain as to any help from God; and as his mind was thus doubtful, he says, that every means of relief were to be tried. And here, as in a mirror, we 				may see how miserable is the condition of all those who call not on God in pure faith: they indeed cry to God, for the impulse of nature thus leads them; but they know not whether they will obtain any thing by their cries: they repeat their prayers; but they know not whether they pass off into air or really come to God. The pilot owns, that his mind was thus doubtful, <i>If so be</i> that God will be <i>propitious to us, call thou also on thy God.</i> Had he been so surely convinced, as to call 				on the true God, he would have certainly found it to have been no doubtful relief. However, that nothing might be left untried, he exhorted Jonah, that if he had a God, to call upon him. We hence see, that there are strange windings, when we do not understand the right way. Men would rather run here and there, a hundred times, through earth and heaven, than come to God, except where his word shines. How so? because when they make the attempt, an insane impulse drives them in different ways; and 				thus they are led here and there: &#8220;It may be, that this may be useful to me; as that way has not succeeded, I will try another.&#8221; God then thus punishes all the unbelieving, who obey not his word; for to the right way they do not keep: He indeed shows how great a madness it is, when men give loose reins to their imaginations, and do not submit to celestial truth.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.viii-p12"></A>As to the words, interpreters translate them in different ways. Some say, &#8220;If so be that God will think of us;&#8221; others &#8220;If so be that God will favor us. <a name="iii.1.viii-p12.1"></A>&#1506;&#1513;&#1514;, <i>oshit,</i> is properly to shine; but when put as here in the conjugation Hithpael, it means to render one&#8217;s 				self clear or bright: and it is a metaphor very common in Scriptures that the face of God is cloudy or dark, when he is not propitious to us; and again, God is said to make bright his face and to appear serene to us, when he really shows himself kind and gracious to us. As then this mode of speaking altogether suits this place, I wonder that some seek extraneous interpretations.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.viii-p14"></A>He afterwards adds, <i>Lest we perish.</i> Here the pilot clearly owns, that he thought the life of man to be in the power of God; for he concluded, that they must perish unless the Lord brought aid. Imprinted then in the minds of all is this notion or <a name="iii.1.viii-p14.1"></A>&#960;&#961;&#959;&#955;&#951;&#968;&#953;&#962;, that is, 				preconception, that when God is angry or adverse, we are miserable, and that near destruction impends over us; and another conviction is found to be in the hearts of men, &#8212; that as soon as the Lord looks on us, his favor and goodwill brings to us immediate safety. The Holy Spirit does not speak here, but a heathen, and we know too how great is the impiety of sailors, and yet he declares this by the impulse of nature, and there is here no feigning; for God, as I have already said, extorts by 				necessity a confession from the unbelieving, which they would gladly avoid.</p>

<p><a name="iii.1.ix-p7"></A>Jonah did not without reason mention this, &#8212; that the passengers consulted together about casting lots; for we hence learn, that it was no ordinary tempest: it appeared then to be a token of God&#8217;s wrath. For, if strong wind arose, it would not have been so strange, for such had been often the case; and if a tempest followed, it would not have been a thing unusual. It must then have been something more dreadful, as it filled men&#8217;s minds 				with alarms so that they were conscious that God was present as an avenger: and we know, that it is not common with ungodly men to recognize the vengeance of Gods except in extreme dangers; but when God executes punishment on sins in an unusual manner, then men begin to acknowledge God&#8217;s vengeance.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.ix-p8"></A>This very thing, Jonah now bears witness to, <i>They said then each to his friend, Come, let us cast</i> <i>lots.</i> Was it not an accustomed thing for them to cast lots whenever a tempest arose? By no means. They had recourse, 				no doubt, to this expedient, because they knew, that God had not raised up that tempest without some very great and very serious cause. This is one thing: but I cannot now pursue the subjects, I must therefore defer it until tomorrow.</p>  <a name="iii.1.x"></A>

<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref25"><a name="iii.1.xi-p1"></A>Lecture Seventy-fourth.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xi-p2"></A>We said in yesterday&#8217;s lecture, that it was a proof of extreme fear, that the sailors and the rest cast lots; for this is not usually done, except men see themselves to be destitute of judgment and counsel.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xi-p3"></A>But it must at the same time be observed, that through error they cast lots: for they did not know, that if God intended to punish each of them, they were worthy even of heavier punishment. They would not indeed have thrown the blame on one man, if each had well considered what he deserved before God. When a calamity happens, it is the duty of every one to examine himself and his whole life before God: then every one, from the first to the 				last, must confess that he bears a just judgment. But when all demand together who is guilty before God, they thus exonerate themselves, as though they were innocent. And it is an evil that prevails at this day in the world, that every one is disposed to cast the blame on others and all would have themselves to be innocent before God; not that they can clear themselves of every fault, but they extenuate their sins, as though God could not justly pursue them with so much severity. As for 				instance, when any one perceives that he had in various ways done wrong, he will indeed confess in words that he is a sinner; but were any person to enumerate and bring forward each of his sins he would say, &#8220;This is a light offense, that is a venal sin; and the Lord deals not with us with so much strict justice, that he means to bring on us instantly extreme punishment.&#8221; When there is a slight offense, it is immediately referred to by every one. Thus acted the sailors, of whom Jonah now 				speaks. Had any one asked, whether they were wholly without fault, every one, no doubt, would have confessed that he was a sinner before God; but yet they cast lots as though one only was exposed to God&#8217;s judgment. How so? because they did not think that their own sins deserved so heavy a punishment. How much soever they might have offended, &#8212; and this they really felt and were convinced of, &#8212; they yet did not make so much of their sins as to think that they deserved any such judgment. This 				then is the reason why they come to the lot; it was, because every one seemed to himself to be blameless when he came to examine himself.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xi-p4"></A>This passage, then, shows what is even well known by common experience, &#8212; that men, though they know themselves to be guilty before God, yet extenuate their sins and promise themselves pardon, as though they could make an agreement with God, that he should not treat them with strict justice, but deal with them indulgently. Hence, then, is the hope of impunity, because we make light offenses of the most grievous sins. Thus 				we find under the Papacy, that various modes are devised, by which they absolve themselves before God and wipe away their stains: the sprinkling of holy water cleanses almost all sins; except a man be either an adulterer, or a murderer, or a sorcerer, or ten times perjured, he hardly thinks himself to be guilty of any crime. Then the expiations which they use, avail, as they think, to obliterate all iniquities. Whence is this error? Even because they consider God to be like themselves, and 				think not their sins to be so great abominations before God. But this is no new thing; for we see what happened in the time of Jonah; and from profane histories also we may learn, that this error possessed everywhere the minds of all. They had then daily expiations, as the Papists have their masses, their pilgrimages, their sprinklings of holy water, and similar playthings (<a name="iii.1.xi-p4.1"></A><i>nugas</i> &#8212; 				trifles, fopperies): but as under the Papacy there are reserved cases, so also in former times, when any one had killed a father or mother, when any one had committed incest, he stood in need of some extraordinary expiation; and if there was any one of great renown on the earth, they applied to him, that he might find out some new kind of expiation. An example of this error is set before us here, when they said, <i>let 				us cast lots.</i> For except they thought that one only was guilty, and not and every one would have publicly confessed his sins, and would then have acknowledged that such was the mass of them as to be enough to fill heaven and earth; but this they did not. One man must have been the offender; but no one came forward with such a confession: hence they cast lots.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xi-p5"></A>It may now be inquired, whether this mode of seeking out the truth was lawful; as they knew not through whose fault the tempest arose, was it right to have recourse to lots? Some have been too superstitious in condemning lots; for they have plainly said, that all lots are wicked. Hence has come the name, lot-drawers; (<a name="iii.1.xi-p5.1"></A><i>sortilegi</i>) and they have thought that lot-drawers differ 				nothing from magicians and enchanters. This has proceeded from ignorance, for we know that the casting of lots has been sometimes allowed. And Solomon certainly speaks, as of a common rule, when he says of lots being cast into the bosom, and of the issue being from Jehovah (<a name="iii.1.xi-p5.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#033">Pr 16:33</a><a name="iii.1.xi-p5.2"></A>.) Solomon speaks not there of the arts of magic but says that when lots are cast, the event is not by chance but by God&#8217;s 				providence. And when Matthias was chosen in the place of Judas, it was done by lot, (<a name="iii.1.xi-p5.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#026">Ac 1:26</a><a name="iii.1.xi-p5.3"></A>.) Did the Apostles use this mode presumptuously? No, the Holy Spirit presided over this election. There is then no doubt but that God approved of that casting of lots. So also Joshua had recourse to the lot when the cause of God&#8217;s displeasure was unknown, though it was evident that God was angry with the people. Joshua, 				being perplexed by what was unknown, did cast lots; and so Achan was discovered and his sacrilege. That lot no one will dare condemn. Then what I have said is clear enough, that those have been too superstitious who have condemned all casting of lots without exception. But we must yet remember that lots are not to be used indiscriminately. It is a part of the civil law, that when a common inheritance is divided, it is allowed to cast lots: as it belongs not to this or that person to choose, 				each must take the part which the lot determines. So again it is lawful to cast lot in great undertakings, when men are anywhere sent: and when there is a division of labor, to prevent jealousy when one wishes to choose a certain part for himself, the lot will remove all contentions. A lot of this kind is allowed both by the word of God, and by civil laws. But when any one adopts the lot without any reason, he is no doubt superstitious, and differs not much from the magician or the enchanter. 				As for instance, when one intends to go a journey, or to take anything in hand, if he throws into his hat a white and a black lot, and says, &#8220;I will see whether my going out today will be prosperous;&#8221; now this is of the devil; for Satan by such arts deludes wretched men. If then any one makes use of the lot without any just reason, he is, as I have said without excuse.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xi-p6"></A>But as to the other lots, such as we have now noticed, they ought not to be viewed as precedents. For though Joshua used the lot to bring to light the cause for which God was angry with his people, it is not yet right for us to imitate what he did; for Joshua was no doubt led by some peculiar influence to adopt this measure. So also as to Saul, when he cast lots, and his son Jonathan was discovered as the one who had tasted honey, it was 				an especial example. The same thing must be also said of the lot mentioned here; for as the sailors were trembling, and knew not the cause why the tempest arose, and the fear of shipwreck seized them, they had recourse to the lot. Were we continually to imitate such examples, such a liberty would not certainly be pleasing, to God, nor consistent with his word. We must therefore bear in mind, that there were some peculiar influences, whenever God&#8217;s servants used the lot in doubtful and extreme 				cases  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A>
 				. This then is shortly the answer to the question &#8212; Was it lawful for the sailors to cast lots, that they might find out the person on account of whom they were in so much danger? I now proceed to what follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.1.xii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption26"><a name="iii.1.xii-p1"></A><a name="iii.1.xii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#008">Jonah 1:8-10</a><a name="iii.1.xii-p1.1"></A></p>

<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.1.xii-p9"></A><a name="iii.1.xii-p9.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xii-p10"></A>After the lot fell on Jonah, they doubted not but that he was the guilty person, any more than if he had been a hundred times proved to be so: for why did they cast lots, except that they were persuaded that all doubt could thus be removed, and that what was hid could thus be brought to the light? As then this persuasion was fixed in their minds, that the truth was elicited, and was in a manner drawn out of darkness by the lot, they now 				inquire of Jonah what he had done: for they took this as allowed, that they had to endure the tempest on his account, and also, that he, by some detestable crime, had merited such a vengeance at Gods hand. We hence see that they cast lots, because they fully believed that they could not otherwise find out the crime on account of which they suffered, and also, that lots were directed by the hidden purpose of God: for how could a certain judgment be found by lot, except God directed it according 				to his own purpose, and overruled what seemed to be especially fortuitous? These principles then were held as certain in a manner by men who were heathens, &#8212; that God can draw out the truth, and bring it to the light, &#8212; and also, that he presides over lots, however fortuitous they may be thought to be.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xii-p11"></A>This was the reason why they now asked what Jonah <i>had done.</i> <i>Tell us,</i> then, <i>why has this evil happened to us, what is thy work?</i> <i>etc.</i> By work here I do not mean what is wrong, but a kind of life, or, as they say, a manner of living. They then asked how Jonah had hitherto employed himself, and what sort of life he followed. For it afterwards follows, <i>Tell us, whence comest thou, what is thy country, and from what people art thou?</i> They made 				inquiries, no doubt, on each particular in due order; but Jonah here briefly records the questions.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.1.xii-p12"></A><a name="iii.1.xii-p12.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xii-p13"></A>I now come to his answer, <i>He said to them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear Jehovah the God of heaven, Who has created the sea and the dry land</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A>
 				  Here Jonah seemed as yet to evade, yea, to disown his crime, for he professed himself to be the worshipper of the true God. Who would not have said, but that he wished here to escape by a subterfuge, as he set up his own piety to cover the crime before-mentioned? But all things are not here in the first verse related; for shortly after, it follows, that the sailors knew of Jonah&#8217;s flight; and that he had himself told them, that he had 				disobeyed God&#8217;s call and command. There is then no doubt but that Jonah honestly confessed his own sin, though he does not say so. But we know, that it is a mode of speaking common among the Hebrews to add in the last place what had been first said; and grammarians say, that it is <a name="iii.1.xii-p14.1"></A>&#8021;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;, (last first,) when anything is left out in its proper place and then added as an explanation. When 				therefore Jonah says that he was <i>an Hebrew,</i> and worshipper of the true God, &#8212; this tended to aggravate his fault or crime rather than to excuse it: for had he said only, that he was conscious of having done wrong in disobeying God, his crime would not have appeared so atrocious; but when he begins by sayings that known to him was the true God, the framer of heaven and earth, the God of Israel, who had made himself known by a law given and 				published, &#8212; when Jonah made this introduction, he thereby removed from himself all pretenses as to ignorance and misconception. He had been educated in the law, and had, from childhood, been taught who the true God was. He could not then have fallen through ignorance; and further, he did not, as the others, worship fictitious gods; he was an Israelite. As then he had been brought up in true religion, his sin was the more atrocious, inasmuch as he had fallen away from God, having despised his 				command, and, as it were, shaken off the yoke, and had become a fugitive.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xii-p15"></A>We now then perceive the reason why Jonah called himself here an Hebrew, and testified that he was the worshipper of the true God. First, by saying that he was an Hebrew, he distinguished the God of Abraham from the idols of the Gentiles: for the religion of the chosen people was well known in all places, though disapproved by universal consent; at the same time, the Cilicians and other Asiatics, and also the Grecians, 				and the Syrians in another quarter, &#8212; all these knew what the Israelites gloried in, &#8212; that the true God had appeared to their father Abraham, and then made with him a gratuitous covenant, and also had given the law by Moses; &#8212; all this was sufficiently known by report. Hence Jonah says now, that he was an Hebrew, as though he had said, that he had no concern with any fictitious god, but with the God of Abraham, who had formerly appeared to the holy Fathers, and who had also given a perpetual 				testimony of his will by Moses. We see then how emphatically he declared, that he was an Hebrew: secondly, he adds, <i>I fear Jehovah the God of heaven.</i> By the word fear is meant worship: for it is not to be taken here as often in other places, that is, in its strict meaning; but fear is to be understood for worship: &#8220;I am not given&#8221;, he says, &#8220;to various superstitions, but I have been taught in true 				religion; God has made himself known to me from my childhood: I therefore do not worship any idol, as almost all other people, who invent gods for themselves; but I worship God, the creator of heaven and earth.&#8221; He calls him <i>the God of heaven,</i> that is, who dwells alone as God in heaven. While the others thought heaven to be filled with a great number of gods, Jonah here sets up 				against them the one true God, as though he said, &#8220;Invent according to your own fancy innumerable gods, there is yet but one, who possesses the highest authority in heaven; for it is he who <i>made the sea and the dry land.</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A>
 				<i>&#8221;</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xii-p17"></A>We now then apprehend what Jonah meant by these words: he shows here that it was no wonder that God pursued him with so much severity; for he had not committed a slight offense, but a fatal sin. We now see how much Jonah had profited since the Lord had begun severely to deal with him: for inasmuch as he was asleep yea, and insensible in his sin, he would have never repented had it not been for this violent remedy. But when the Lord 				roused him by his severity, he then not only confessed that he was guilty, or owned his guilt in a formal manner, (<a name="iii.1.xii-p17.1"></A><i>defunctorie</i> &#8212; as ridding one&#8217;s self of a business, carelessly;) but also willingly testified, as we see, before men who were heathens, that he was the guilty man, who had forsaken the true God, in whose worship he had been well instructed. This was the fruit of true penitence, and it was also the fruit of the 				chastisement which God had inflicted on him. If then we wish God to approve of our repentance, let us not seek evasions, as for the most part is the case; nor let us extenuate our sins, but by a free confession testify before the whole world what we have deserved.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.1.xii-p18"></A><a name="iii.1.xii-p18.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xii-p19"></A>It then follows, that the men feared with great fear, and said, <i>Why hast thou done this?</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A>
 				 for they knew that he had fled from the presence of Jehovah, for he had told them. And this is not unimportant &#8212; that <i>the sailors feared with great fear: </i>for Jonah means that they were not only moved by what he said, but also terrified, so that they gave to the true God his glory. We indeed know that superstitious men almost trifle with their own 				idols. They often entertain, it is true, strange fears, but afterwards they flatter themselves, and in a manner cajole their own hearts, so that they can pleasantly and sweetly smile at their own fancies. But Jonah, by saying here that they <i>feared with great fear,</i> means that they were so smitten, that they really perceived that the God of Israel was a righteous judge, and that he was not such as other nations fancied him to be, but that he was 				capable of affording dreadful examples whenever he intended to execute his vengeance. We hence see what Jonah means, when he speaks of great fear. At the same time, two things ought to be noticed, &#8212; that they feared, because it was easy for them to conclude from the Prophet&#8217;s words, that the God of Israel was the only creator of heaven and earth, &#8212; and then, that it was a great fear, which, as I have said, must be considered as serious dread, since the fear which the unbelieving have soon 				vanishes.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xii-p21"></A>But with regard to the reproof which the sailors and other passengers gave to Jonah, the Lord returned to him this as a reward which he had deserved. He had fled from the presence of God; he had thus, as we have said taken away from God his supreme power: for what becomes of God&#8217;s authority when any one of us rejects his commands and flees away from his presence? Since Jonah then sought to shun God, he was now placed before men. There 				were present heathens, and even barbarians, who rebuked him for his sin, who were his censors and judges. And the same thing we see happening often. For they who do not willingly obey God and his word, afterwards abandon themselves to many flagrant sins, and their baseness becomes evident to all. As, then, they cannot bear God to be their Master and Teacher, they are constrained to bear innumerable censors; for they are branded by the reproaches of the vulgar, they are pointed at every where by 				the finger, at length they are conducted to the gallows, and the executioner becomes their chief teacher. The case was similar, as we see, with Jonah: the pilot had before reproved his torpor, when he said, Do thou also call on thy God; what meanest thou, O sleeper? thou liest down here like a log of wood, and yet thou sees us perplexed and in extreme danger. As, then, the pilot first so sharply inveighed against Jonah, and then all reproved him with one mouth, we certainly find that he was 				made subject to the condemnation of all, because he tried to deprive God of his supreme power. If at any time the same thing should happen to us, if God should subject us to the reproaches of men when we seek to avoid his judgment, let us not wonder. But as Jonah here calmly answers, and raises no clamor, and shows no bitterness, so let every one of us, in the true spirit of meekness, acknowledge our own sins; when charged with them, were even children our condemners, or were even the most 				contemptible of the people to rise up against us, let us patiently bear all this; and let us know that these kinds of censors befall us through the providence of God. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.1.xiii"></A>

For since it was certain that through his fault God was displeased with them all, why was it that they did not save themselves by such an expiation? That they then delayed in so great a danger, and dared not to lay hold instantly on Jonah, was an evident proof that they were restrained, as I have said, by the fear of God.</p>

 				 <i>for the sea was going,</i> etc. By going Jonah means, that the sea was turbulent: for the sea is said to rest when it is calm, but when it is turbulent, then it is going, and has various movements and tossings. <i>The sea,</i> then, <i>was going and very 				tempestuous</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A>
 				 We hence see that God was not satisfied with the disgrace of Jonah, but he purposed to punish his offense still more. It was necessary that Jonah should be led to the punishment which he deserved, though afterwards, he was miraculously delivered from death, as we shall see in its proper place.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.1.xiii-p12"></A><a name="iii.1.xiii-p12.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xiii-p13"></A>Jonah then answers, <i>Take me, and throw me into the sea, and it will be still to you.</i> It may be asked whether Jonah ought to have of his own accord offered himself to die; for it seemed to be an evidence of desperation. He might, indeed, have surrendered himself to their will; but here he did, as it were, stimulate them, 				&#8220;<i>Throw me into the sea</i>,&#8221; he says; &#8220;for ye cannot otherwise pacify God than by punishing me.&#8221; He seemed like a man in despair, when he would thus advance to death of his own accord. But Jonah no doubt knew that he was doomed to punishment by God. It is uncertain whether he then entertained a hope of deliverance, that is, whether he confidently relied at this time on the grace of God. But, however it 				may have been, we may yet conclude, that he gave himself up to death, because he knew and was fully persuaded that he was in a manner summoned by the evident voice of God. And thus there is no doubt but that he patiently submitted to the judgment which the Lord had allotted to him. <i>Take me,</i> then, <i>and throw me into the 				sea</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xiii-p14"></A>Then he adds, <i>The sea will be to you still</i>  Here Jonah not only declares that God would be pacified by his death, because the lot had fallen upon him, but he also acknowledges that his death would suffice as an expiation, so that the tempest would subside: and then the reason 				follows &#8212; <i>I know,</i> he says, <i>that on my account is this great tempest come upon you.</i> When he says that he knew this, he could not refer to the lot, for that knowledge was common to them all. But Jonah speaks here by the prophetic spirit: and he no doubt 				confirms what I have before referred to, &#8212; that the God of Israel was the supreme and only King of heaven and earth. This certainty of knowledge, then, of which Jonah speaks, must be referred to his own consciences and to the teaching of that religion in which he had been instructed.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xiii-p15"></A>And now we may learn from these words a most useful instruction: Jonah does not here expostulate with God, nor contumeliously complain that God punished him too severely, but he willingly bears his charged guilt and his punishment, as he did before when he said, &#8220;I am the worshipper of the true God.&#8221; How could he confess the true God, whose great displeasure he was then experiencing? But Jonah, we see, was so subdued, 				that he failed not to ascribe to God his just honor; though death was before his eyes, though God&#8217;s wrath was burning, we yet see, that he gave to God, as we have said, the honor due to him. So the same thing is repeated in this place, <i>Behold,</i> he says, <i>I know that on my account has this great tempest happened</i> He who takes to 				himself all the blame, does not certainly murmur against God. It is then a true confession of repentance, when we acknowledge God, and willingly testify before men that he is just, though, according to the judgment of our flesh, he may deal violently with us. When however we give to him the praise due to his justice, we then really show our penitence; for unless God&#8217;s wrath brings us down to this humble state of mind, we shall be always full of bitterness; and, however silent we may be for a 				time, our heart will be still perverse and rebellious. This humility, then, always follows repentance, &#8212; the sinner prostrates himself before God, and willingly admits his own sin, and tries not to escape by subterfuges.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xiii-p16"></A>And it was no wonder that Jonah thus humbled himself; for we see that the sailors did the same: when they said that lots were to be cast, they added at the same time, &#8220;Come ye and let us cast lots, that we may know why this evil has happened to us.&#8221; They did not accuse God, but constituted him the Judge; and thus they acknowledged that he inflicted a just punishment. And yet every one thought himself to have been innocent; for however 				conscience might have bitten them, still no one considered himself to have been guilty of so great a wickedness as to subject him to God&#8217;s vengeance. Though, then, the sailors thought themselves exempt from any great sin, they yet did not contend with God, but allowed him to be their Judge. Since then they, who were so barbarous, confined themselves within these bounds of modesty, it was no wonder that Jonah, especially when he was roused and began to feel his guilt, and was also powerfully 				restrained by God&#8217;s hand, &#8212; it was no wonder that he now confessed that he was guilty before God, and that he justly suffered a punishment so heavy and severe. We ought then to take special notice of this, &#8212; that he knew that on his account the storm happened or that the sea was so tempestuous against them all. The rest we defer until tomorrow.</p>  <a name="iii.1.xiv"></A>

<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.1.xvi-p7"></A><a name="iii.1.xvi-p7.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xvi-p8"></A>This verse shows that the sailors and the rest were more inclined to mercy, when they saw that the holy Prophet was willing to undergo the punishment which he had deserved. When therefore, he confessed that he was guilty, and refused not to be punished, they became anxious to spare his life, though they were heathens, and also for the most part barbarians: and as each of them could not but be frightened with his immediate danger, the 				wonder is increased, that they had such regard for the life of one who alone was in fault, and who had now freely confessed this. But the Lord so turned their hearts, that they now saw more clearly how grievous a sin it was to flee away from the call of God, and not to yield obedience, as we have before observed, to his command. Many think that this is a light offense, and readily indulge themselves in it: but it is not in the power of men to weigh sins; the balance is deceitful when men 				estimate their sins according to their own judgment. Let us then learn to ascribe to God his own honor, &#8212; that he alone is Judge, and is far above us, and can alone determine how grievous or how slight any sin is. But common sense, except when men willfully deceive themselves by vain flatteries, clearly teaches this, &#8212; that it is no light offense when we evade the command of God; for, as we have stated, men do thus take away from God his supreme authority; and what is left to God, when he 				governs not the creatures whom he has formed, and whom he sustains by his power? The Lord, then, designed to show here, that his displeasure could not be otherwise pacified than by drowning Jonah in the sea; though, as we shall presently see, he had something greater in view. But, in the meantime, this is worthy of being observed, &#8212; that the Lord intended to make Jonah an example, that all may now know that he is not to be trifled with, but that he ought to be obeyed as soon as he commands any 				thing.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xvi-p9"></A>The word which the Prophet uses has been variously explained by interpreters. <a name="iii.1.xvi-p9.1"></A>&#1495;&#1514;&#1512;, <i>chetar,</i> is properly, to dig; so that some think it to be a metaphorical expression, as rowers seem to dig the sea; and this sense is not unsuitable. Others carry the metaphor still 				higher, &#8212; that the sailors searched out or sought means by which they might drive the ship to land. But the other metaphor, as being less remote, is more to be approved. The Latins call it to toil, (<a name="iii.1.xvi-p9.2"></A><i>moliri</i>) when the rowers not only apply gently their oars, but when they make a greater effort. <i>The sailors,</i> then, <i>toiled to bring back the ship</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A>
 				  But for what purpose? To spare the life of the man who had already confessed that he was guilty before God, and that the storm, which threatened them all with a shipwreck, had arisen through his fault: but he says that they could not, for the sea was tempestuous, as we have already seen in our yesterday&#8217;s lecture.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.1.xvi-p11"></A><a name="iii.1.xvi-p11.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xvi-p12"></A>I come now to the second verse. <i>They cried,</i> he says, <i>to Jehovah and said, We beseech</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A>
 				<i>, Jehovah, let us not perish, we pray, on account of the life of this man, and give not,</i> that is, lay not, <i>innocent blood upon us</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A>
 				 The Prophet now expresses more fully why the sailors toiled so much to return to port, or to reach some shore, &#8212; they were already persuaded that Jonah was a worshipper of the true God, and not only this, but that he was a Prophet, inasmuch as he had told them, as we have seen, that he had fled from the presence of God, because he feared to execute the command which we have noticed. It was therefore pious (<a name="iii.1.xvi-p14.4"></A><i>reverentia</i>) fear that restrained the sailors, knowing, as they did, that Jonah was the servant of the true God. They, at the same time, saw, that Jonah was already standing for his sin before God&#8217;s tribunal, and that punishment was demanded. This they saw; but yet they wished to preserve his life.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xvi-p15"></A>Now this place shows, that there is by nature implanted in all an abhorrence of cruelty; for however brutal and sanguinary many men may be, they yet cannot divest themselves of this feeling, &#8212; that the effusion of human blood is hateful. Many, at the same time, harden themselves; but they apply a searing iron: they cannot shake off horror, nay, they feel that they are detested by God and by men, when they thus shed 				innocent blood. Hence it was that the sailors, who in other respects hardly retained a drop of humanity, fled as suppliants to God, when the case was about the death of man; and they said, <a name="iii.1.xvi-p15.1"></A>&#1488;&#1504;&#1492; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, <i>ane Ieve</i>, &#8216;We beseech Jehovah:&#8217; and the expression is repeated; which shows that the sailors earnestly prayed that the Lord would not impute 				this as a sin to them.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xvi-p16"></A>We hence see that though these men had never known the doctrine of the law, they were yet so taught by nature that they knew that the blood of man is dear and precious in the sight of God. And as to us, we ought not only to imitate these sailors, but to go far beyond them: for not only ought the law of nature to prevail among us, but also the law of God; for we hear what God had formerly pronounced with his own mouth,</p>  			 
<p class="Center"><a name="iii.1.xvi-p17"></A>&#8216;Whosoever sheddeth man&#8217;s blood, shed shall his blood be,&#8217; (<a name="iii.1.xvi-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006">Ge 9:6</a><a name="iii.1.xvi-p17.1"></A>.)</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xvi-p18"></A>And we know also the reason why God undertakes to protect the life of men, and that is, because they have been created in his image. Whosoever then uses violence against the life of man, destroys, as far as he can the image of the eternal God. Since it is so, ought not violence and cruelty to be regarded by us with double horror? We ought also to learn another thing from this doctrine: God proves by this remarkable testimony what 				paternal feeling he manifests towards us by taking our life under his own guardianship and protection; and he even proves that we are really the objects of his care, inasmuch as he will execute punishment and vengeance when any one unjustly injures us. We then see that this doctrine on the one side restrains us, that we may not attempt anything against the lives of our brethren; and, on the other side, it assures us of the paternal love of God, so that being allured by his kindness we may learn 				to deliver up ourselves wholly to his protection.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xvi-p19"></A>I now come to the last clause of the verse, <i>For thou, Jehovah, hast done as it has pleased thee.</i> The sailors clearly prove here that they did not willingly shed innocent blood. How then can these two things agree, &#8212; that the blood was innocent, and that they were blameless? They adopted this excuse, &#8212; that they obeyed God&#8217;s 				decree, that they did nothing rashly or according to their own inclinations, but followed what the Lord had prescribed: though, indeed, God had not spoken, yet what he required was really evident; for as God demanded an expiation by the death of Jonah, so he designed to continue the tempest until he was thrown into the deep. These things the sailors now put forward. But we must notice, that they did not cast the blame on God, as blasphemers are wont to do, who, while they seek to exempt 				themselves from blame, find fault with God, or at least put him in their own place: &#8220;Why then,&#8221; they say, &#8220;does he sit as a judge to condemn us for that of which he is himself the author, since he has so decreed?&#8221; At this day there are many fanatics who thus speak, who obliterate all the difference between good and evil, as if lust were to them the law. They at the same time make a covert of God&#8217;s providence. Jonah wished not that such a thing should be thought of the sailors; but as they well 				understood that God governed the world justly, though his counsels be secret and cannot be comprehended by us, &#8212; as, then, they were thus convinced, they thus strengthened themselves; and though they gave to God the praise due to his justice, they at the same time trembled lest they should be guilty of innocent blood.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xvi-p20"></A>We now then see how reverently these men spoke of God, and that so much religious fear possessed them, that they did not rob God of his praise, <i>Thou Jehovah,</i> they said, <i>hast done as it has pleased thee</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A>
 				  Do they here accuse God of tyranny, as though he confounded all things without any cause or reason? By no means. They took this principle as granted, &#8212; that the will of God is right and just, yea, that whatever God has decreed is beyond doubt just. Being then thus persuaded, they took the will of God as the rule for acting rightly: &#8220;As thou, Jehovah, hast done as it seemed good to thee, so we are blameless.&#8221; But at the same time it is 				proper also to add, that the sailors do not vainly talk here of the secret providence of God in order to impute murder to him, as ungodly men and profane cavilers do at this day: but as the Lord made known his purpose to them, they show that the storm and the tempest could not be otherwise calmed and quieted than by drowning Jonah: they therefore took this knowledge of God&#8217;s purpose as a certain rule to follow. At the same time they fled, as I have said, to God, and supplicated his mercy, lest 				in a matter so perplexed and difficult he should involve them in the same punishment, as they were constrained to shed innocent blood. We now then apprehend the meaning of this passage. Now it follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.1.xvii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption26"><a name="iii.1.xvii-p1"></A><a name="iii.1.xvii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#015">Jonah 1:15</a><a name="iii.1.xvii-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iii.1.xvii-p2"></A><b>15.</b> So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iii.1.xvii-p3"></A><b>15. </b>Et sustulerunt Jonam, et projecerunt in mare; et stetit mare a fervore suo.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xvii-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.1.xvii-p5"></A><a name="iii.1.xvii-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xvii-p6"></A>Jonah shows here that the tempest arose through his fault; for the issue proved this with certainty. The sailors had not only cast lots, but after Jonah was thrown into the sea the storm calmed, and the sea became still, &#8212; this sudden change sufficiently proved that Jonah was the only cause why they were so nearly shipwrecked. For if the sea had not calmed immediately, but after some interval of time, it might have been ascribed to 				chance: but as the sea instantly rested, it could not be otherwise said than that Jonah was condemned by the judgment of God. He was indeed cast into the sea by the hands of men; but God so presided, that nothing could be ascribed to men, but that they executed the judgment which the Lord had openly demanded and required from them. This, then, is the import of this verse. He now adds &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.1.xviii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption26"><a name="iii.1.xviii-p1"></A><a name="iii.1.xviii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#016">Jonah 1:16</a><a name="iii.1.xviii-p1.1"></A></p>

<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.1.xviii-p5"></A><a name="iii.1.xviii-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xviii-p6"></A>Jonah now declares what fruit followed; and first, he says, that the sailors feared the true God. He uses here the proper name of God, Jehovah; for, as we have already seen, they were addicted to their own superstitions, as each of them cried to his own god: but it was a false notion; for they went astray after their own superstitions. The Prophet now points out the difference, &#8212; that they began to fear the true God. At the same time it 				may have been, that they afterwards relapsed into their own errors; yet it ought not to be overlooked that the Lord constrained them to entertain such a fear. The Hebrews, as it has been already said, sometimes take fear in a general sense, as meaning worship. It is said in <a name="iii.1.xviii-p6.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#032">2 Kings 17:32</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#033">33</a><a name="iii.1.xviii-p6.1"></A>, of the new inhabitants of the land of Canaan, who had been removed from Persia, that they 				&#8220;feared God,&#8221; that is, that they imitated the legal rite in sacrifices while worshipping God. But there is an addition in this place, which shows that the meaning is more restricted, for it is said to have been a <i>great fear.</i> Then Jonah means that the sailors and the passengers were not only touched with the fear of God, but that they also had the impression that the God of Israel was the supreme King of heaven and earth, that he held all things under his hand and government. This fear no 				doubt led them to true knowledge so as to know that they were previously deluded, and that whatever the world had invented was mere delusion, and that the gods devised by the fancies of men were nothing else but mere idols. We now then perceive what Jonah means.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xviii-p7"></A>But we must here say somewhat more at large of the fear of God. When the Scripture speaks of the fear of God, it sometimes means the outward worship, and sometimes true piety. When it designates the outward worship, it is no great thing; for hypocrites usually perform their ceremonies, and thus testify that they worship God: but yet, as they obey not God with sincerity of heart, nor bring faith and repentance, they do nothing but 				trifle. But the fear of God is often taken for true piety; and then it is called the beginning or the chief point of wisdom, or even wisdom itself, as it is in <a name="iii.1.xviii-p7.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028">Job 28:28</a><a name="iii.1.xviii-p7.1"></A>. The fear of God, then, or that pious regard (<a name="iii.1.xviii-p7.2"></A><i>reventia</i>) by which the faithful willingly submit themselves to God, is the chief part of wisdom.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xviii-p8"></A>But it also often happens that men are touched by servile fear, so as to have a desire to satisfy God, while, at the same time, they have even a wish to draw him down from his throne. This servile fear is full of perverseness; for they, at the same time, champ the bridle, as they cannot exempt themselves from his power and authority. Such was this fear of which Jonah speaks; for all those whom he mentions were not suddenly so changed as 				to devote themselves to the true God: they had not indeed made such a progress as this; it was not such real and thorough conversion of the soul as changed them into new men. How, then, is it said that they feared? even because the Lord extorted from them a confession at the time: it may have been that some of them afterwards made a greater progress; but I speak now generally of the whole. Because then it is said that they feared God, we are not hence to conclude that they really repented, so 				as to become wholly devoted to the God of Israel. But yet they were constrained to know and to confess that the God of Israel was the only and the true God. How so? because that dreadful judgment filled them with terror, so that they perceived that he alone was God who had heaven and earth under his command.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xviii-p9"></A>We now then see how that fear is to be viewed, of which Jonah speaks. If they afterwards made no farther progress, it only served to condemn them, that these sailors, having perceived by a sure evidence who the only true God was, mingled with the worship of him their wicked and ungodly superstitions, as many do even in our day. The Papists hold this truth in common with us, &#8212; that there is one true God, the framer of heaven and earth, 				yea, they come still nearer, and say that the only-begotten Son of God is our Redeemer; but yet we see how they contaminate the whole worship of God, and turn his truth to a lie; for they blend the worship of God with that of idols, so that there is nothing pure among them. But this main truth is however of great service, when the Lord stretches forth his hand to miserable men; for if there was no conviction of this under the Papacy that the word of God is to be believed, and that Christ the 				Son of God is the King and Head of the Church, we must have had to employ against them a long circuitous argument; but now an access to them is easy: when we bring against them the Law, and the Prophets, and the Gospel, they are restrained by some measure of reverence, and dare not to reject the authority of the Supreme God. We then see, that this fear is in itself of no great value, if men remain fixed in their own mire; but when it is the Lords purpose afterwards to call them, this fear opens 				for them the door to true godliness. So it may have been, as I have said, that some of these sailors and passengers had afterwards made better progress. But this fear of itself could have done nothing more than to convict them, so that no excuse could avail them before God&#8217;s tribunal; for a proof had been given them, by which they might know that there was no other God than He who was then worshipped by the chosen people.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xviii-p10"></A>He afterwards adds that they <i>sacrificed a sacrifice to Jehovah</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A>
 				 They were accustomed before to offer sacrifices to their idols; but now they testified that they worshipped the God of Israel; for this is what sacrifices signify. But it must at the same time be observed that they thereby expressed this confession, that God confirmed the truth of his word. When, therefore, they perceived that this whole affair was ordered by the will of God, they were constrained to bear witness that he was the true God: this was the end and 				design of sacrifices.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xviii-p12"></A>It may, however, be inquired, whether that sacrifice pleased God. It is certain that whenever men bring forward their own devices, whatever is otherwise worthy of approbation in what they do, it cannot but be corrupted and vitiated by such a mixture; for God, as it is well known, allows of no associate. And we must remember that which is said in Ezekiel, &#8216;Go ye, sacrifice to the devil, and not to me!&#8217; God there repudiates all the 				sacrifices which were wont to be offered by the people of Israel, because superstitions were blended with them. God then shows that such a mixture is so disapproved by him, that he chooses rather that the superstitious should wholly give themselves up to the devils than that his holy name should be thus profaned. Hence this sacrifice of itself was not lawful, nor could it have pleased God; but it was, so to speak, by accident and extrinsically that this sacrifice pleased God, &#8212; because he 				designed thus to make known his glory. Though, then, he repudiated the sailors themselves, yet it was his will that this act should bear a testimony to his glory: as, for instance, a deed is often vicious with regard to men, and yet in an accidental way it tends to set forth the glory of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xviii-p13"></A>And this ought to be carefully borne in mind: there is at this day a dispute, yea a fierce contest, about good works: and the Sophists ever deceive themselves by false reasoning; (<a name="iii.1.xviii-p13.1"></A>&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#8182; &#8212; sophistry) for they suppose that works morally good are either preparatory to the obtaining of grace, or meritorious towards 				attaining eternal life. When they speak of works morally good, they refer only to the outward deeds; they regard not the fountain or motive, nor even the end. When the heart of man is impure, unquestionably the work which thence flows is also ever impure, and is an abomination before God. When the end also is wrong, when it is not man&#8217;s purpose to worship God in sincerity of heart, the deed, however splendid it may appear, is filth in the presence of God. Hence the Sophists are greatly 				deceived, and are very childish, when they say, that works morally good please God, and are preparatory to grace and meritorious of salvation. But can this be, that a work does not please God, and yet avails to set forth his glory? I answer, that these two things are perfectly consistent, and are in no way so contrary that they cannot be easily reconciled. For God by accident, as I have said, accommodates to his own glory what is in itself vicious; I say, in itself, that is, with respect to 				men. Thus even under the Papacy the Christian name serves to the glory of God, for there ever remains some remnant. And how has it happened, that at this time the light of the Gospel has shone forth, and that true religion has been restored at least in many places? Even because the Lord has never suffered true religion to be extinguished, though it has been corrupted: for baptism under the Papacy, the very name of Christ as well as of the Church, and the very form of religion &#8212; all these have 				become wholly useless; but they have accidentally, as I have said, been of great service. When, therefore, we regard the priests (<a name="iii.1.xviii-p13.2"></A><i>sacrificos</i> &#8212; the sacrificers) as well as the people, we find nothing but a perverted worship of God; they presumptuously and indiscriminately add their own superstitions and devices to the word of God, and there is nothing pure among them. Since then they 				thus blend together heaven and earth, they do nothing but provoke God&#8217;s wrath against themselves.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xviii-p14"></A>We now then understand why Jonah says that the sailors and passengers offered sacrifices. We must, at the same time, remember what I have lately said, that sacrifice was, as it were, a symbol of Divine worship: for even from the beginning this notion prevailed among all, that sacrifices were to be offered to none but to God; and heathens in all ages had no other opinion of sacrifices, but that they thus manifested their piety towards 				their gods. Since then sacrifices have been from the beginning offered to God alone, it follows, that they at this day are wholly inexcusable who join associates to God, and offer their sacrifices to mortals or to angels. How can this be borne in Christians, since heathens have ever confessed that they regarded those as gods to whom they were wont to offer their sacrifices? Now then, since God declares that the chief sacrifice to him is invocations as we read in 				<a name="iii.1.xviii-p14.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001">Ps 1:1</a><a name="iii.1.xviii-p14.1"></A>, the whole of religion under the Papacy must be perverted, as they pray not only to God but even to creatures: for they hesitate not to flee to Peter or to Paul, yea, to their own saints, real and fictitious, in the same manner as to the only true God. Inasmuch, then, as they rob God of this chief right, we see that they tread under foot the whole of religion by this sacrilege. Since, then, heathen 				men testified that they worshipped Jehovah, the God of Israel, by their external sacrifice, let us learn at this day not to transfer the rightful honor of God to creatures; but let this honor of being alone prayed to, be wholly and entirely reserved for him; for this, as we have said is the chief and the most valuable sacrifice which he demands and approves.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xviii-p15"></A>But Jonah also adds, that the sailors <i>vowed vows to God</i>  This is a part of thanksgiving; for we know that the object, not only of the holy fathers, but also of the superstitious, in making vows, has ever been this &#8212; to bind themselves to God, and also to express their gratitude, and to make it 				evident, that they owed to him both their life and every favor bestowed on them. This then has in all ages been the reason for making, vows. When, therefore the sailors vowed a vow to God, they renounced their own idols. They cried before to their gods; but now they understand that they had cried in vain, and without any benefit, as they had to no purpose uttered their cries in the air. Now then they made their vows to the only true God; for they knew that their lives were in his 				hand.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xviii-p16"></A>And here we may easily learn how foolishly the Sophists of our day heap together all passages of Scripture which make any mention of vows; for they think that we are to be overwhelmed by that term alone, when we condemn their false vows. But no one of us has ever denied or does deny, that it is lawful to vows provided it be done according to what the Law and the Gospel prescribes. What we hold is, &#8212; that men are not thoughtlessly to 				obtrude on God what comes uppermost, but that they are to vow what he approves, and also, that they regard a right and just end in vowing, even to testify their gratitude to God. But in common vows which are made, there are the grossest errors, as also in the whole of the Papal worship; for they vow this and that to God indiscriminately, and regard not what the Lord requires or approves: one, on certain days, abstains from meat; another combs not his head: and a third trots away on some 				pilgrimage. All these things, we know, are rejected by God. And further, when they vow nothing but what God approves, it is yet done for a wrong purpose: for they seek in this way to bind God to themselves, and the diabolical conceit of merits ever possesses their minds. And, lastly, they consider not what they can do; they vow perpetual celibacy when at the same time incontinence burns them; and thus we see that, like the giants, they fight with God himself; and, in the meantime, they allow 				themselves an unbridled liberty as to whatever they vow.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xviii-p17"></A>Let us then know, that whenever the Scripture speaks of vows, we are to take for granted these two principles, &#8212; that vows as they appertain to the worship of God, ought not to be taken without any discretion, according to men&#8217;s fancy, but ought to be regulated and guided by God&#8217;s rule, so that men may bring nothing to God, except what they know to be approved by his word, &#8212; and then, that they are to keep in view the right end, even 				to show by this symbol their gratitude to God, to testify that they are preserved by his kindness, as was the case with these sailors, who made a vow because they thought that none but God was their deliverer; and so they testified, that when they came safe to shore, they would make it known that the God of Israel had showed mercy to them. It follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.1.xix"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption26"><a name="iii.1.xix-p1"></A><a name="iii.1.xix-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#017">Jonah 1:17</a><a name="iii.1.xix-p1.1"></A></p>

<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.1.xix-p5"></A><a name="iii.1.xix-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xix-p6"></A>What the Prophet here briefly relates ought to be carefully weighed by us. It is easily passed over, when we read in a few words that Jonah was swallowed up by a fish, and that he was there three days and three nights: but though Jonah neither amplified or illustrated in a rhetorical manner what is overlooked by us, nor adopted any display of words, but spoke of the event as though it were an ordinary thing, we yet see what the event 				itself really was: Jonah was cast into the sea. He had been previously not only a worshipper of the true God, but also a Prophet, and had no doubt faithfully discharged his office; for God would not have resolved to send him to Nineveh, had he not conferred on him suitable gifts; and he knew him to be qualified for undertaking a burden so great and so important. As Jonah then had faithfully endeavored to serve God, and to devote himself to him through the whole of his past life, now that he is 				cast into the sea as one unworthy of the common light, that he is cut off from the society of men, and that he seems unworthy of undergoing a common or an ordinary punishment, but is exiled, as it were, from the world, so as to be deprived of light and air, as parricides, to whom formerly, as it is well-known, this punishment was allotted &#8212; as then Jonah saw that he was thus dealt with, what must have been the state of his mind?</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xix-p7"></A>Now that he tells us that he was three whole days in the inside of the fish, it is certain that the Lord had so awakened him that he must have endured continual uneasiness. He was asleep before he was swallowed by the fish; but the Lord drew him, as it were, by force to his tribunal, and he must have suffered a continual execution. He must have every moment entertained such thoughts as these, &#8220;Why does he now thus deal with thee? God does 				not indeed slay thee at once, but intends to expose thee to innumerable deaths.&#8221; We see what Job says, that when he died he would be at rest and free from all evils, (<a name="iii.1.xix-p7.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#006">Job 14:6</a><a name="iii.1.xix-p7.1"></A>.) Jonah no doubt continually boiled with grief, because he knew that God was opposed to and displeased with him: he doubtless said to himself, &#8220;Thou hast to do, not with men, but with God himself, who now pursues thee, because thou hast 				become a fugitive from his presence.&#8221; As Jonah then must have necessarily thus thought within himself of God&#8217;s wrath, his case must have been harder than hundred deaths, as it had been with Job and with many others, who made it their chief petition that they might die. Now as he was not slain but languished in continual torments, it is certain that no one of us can comprehend, much less convey in words what must have come into the mind of Jonah during these three days. But I cannot now discuss 				what remains; I must therefore defer it to the next lecture.</p>  <a name="iii.1.xx"></A>  			 
<p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld29"><a name="iii.1.xx-p1"></A>Prayer.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xx-p2"></A>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou settest before us this day thy holy Prophet as an awful example of thy wrath against all who are rebellious and disobedient to thee, &#8212; O grant, that we may learn so to subject all our thoughts and affections to thy word, that we may not reject any thing that pleases thee, but so learn both to live and to die to thee, that we may ever regard thy will, and undertake nothing but what thou hast testified is approved by 				thee, so that we may fight under thy banners, and through life obey thy word, until at length we reach that blessed rest which has been obtained for us by the blood of thy only begotten Son, and is laid up for us in heaven through the hope of his Gospel. Amen.</p>  <a name="iii.1.xxi"></A>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref25"><a name="iii.1.xxi-p1"></A>lecture Seventy-sixth</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xxi-p2"></A>In yesterday&#8217;s lecture we began to explain the last verse of the first chapter, in which Jonah said, that <i>a fish was prepared by the Lord</i>  We stated that it could not have been otherwise but that Jonah, when he was in the inside of the fish, must have felt the most grievous agonies, as though he had been 				doomed to perpetual death, as long as he was deprived of the enjoyment of God&#8217;s favor: and this fact will be further explained when his song comes under our consideration.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.1.xxi-p3"></A>But now there is a question to be considered and that is whether God created a fish to receive Jonah. The expression, that God <i>prepared a fish</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A>
 				 seems indeed to mean this; for if the fish had already been swimming in the sea, the Prophet might have adopted another mode of speaking and said, that the Lord caused the fish to meet him or that God had sent a fish; for so the Scripture usually speaks: but a fish is said to have been prepared. This doubt may be thus removed, &#8212; that though God may not have created the fish, he had yet prepared him for this purpose; for we know that it was not according to the 				course of nature that the fish swallowed Jonah, and also, that he was preserved uninjured in his inside for three days and three nights. I therefore refer what is said here, that a <i>fish was prepared,</i> to the preservation of Jonah: for it is certain that there are some fishes which can swallow men whole and entire. And William Rondelet, who has written a book on the fishes of the sea, concludes that in all probability it must have been the 				<i>Lamia.</i> He himself saw that fish, and he says that it has a belly so capacious and, mouth so wide, that it can easily swallow up a man; and he says that a man in armor has sometimes been found in the inside of the Lamia. Therefore, as I have said, either a whale, or a Lamia, or a fish unknown to us, may be able to swallow up a man whole and entire; but he who is thus devoured cannot live in the inside of a fish. Hence Jonah, that he might mark it 				out as a miracle, says that the fish was prepared by the Lord; for he was received into the inside of the fish as though it were into an hospital; and though he had no rest there, yet he was as safe as to his body, as though he were walking on land. Since then the Lord, contrary to the order of nature, preserved there his Prophet, it is no wonder that he says that the<i> fish was prepared by the Lord. </i>I come now to the second chapter.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.1.viii-p13"></A> Calvin is quite right here.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.1.xi-p7"></A> Similar is the view given by <i>Jerome</i>. &#8220;We ought not, for this example, to put implicit confidence in lots, nor to connect with it the instance recorded in the Acts, when Matthias was chosen an Apostle by lot, since privileges granted to individuals cannot make a common rule, (<a name="iii.1.xi-p7.1"></A><i>cum privilegia singulorum non possint legem </i>facere communem.&#8221;)</p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.1.xii-p14"></A> This answer reverses the order of the questions. He answers the last question first. &#8220;Whence comest thou, and what is thy country?&#8221; The answer is, &#8220;I am Hebrew.&#8221; The previous question was, &#8220;What is thy work,&#8221; or occupation? To this he answers, &#8220;I fear Jehovah,&#8221; etc. This was his calling, his work, his occupation. &#8220;Fear,&#8221; of course, includes worship and service. This ought to be the work and occupation of all. But to the first question, as to 					 what evil he had done, he gives no answer. <i>Calvin</i> supposes that the whole is not here related, but is to be gathered from what follows. It is, however, probable that he had previously told them, that is, before the storm arose, that he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord: he therefore left them to conclude what evil it was which he had done. It may be inquired why he said that he was &#8220;Hebrew,&#8221; and not that he was an Israelite, as the case really was, for he belonged to the ten 					 tribes, and not to the kingdom of Judah; and Israelites, and not Hebrews seem to have been then the common name of the ten tribes. The reason may be, that as the Israelites were then for the most part idolatrous, he wished to show that he was a true descendant of the patriarchs, who were God&#8217;s faithful servants, real Hebrews, passengers, sojourners, and pilgrims, as the word imparts, on the earth. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

Though it might be an indigenous plant, yet to provide it so quickly in one night was the act of Divine power. So also as to this fish, it might or it might not have been one usually found in that part of the sea. To provide it, but bringing it to the spot, was as much a miracle as to provide it by a new act of creation. To allow the one and to deny the other, is wholly unreasonable. The whole was clearly miraculous: and the discovery of any such fish now does not in the least render 					 the transaction less miraculous. Every part of it must be ascribed to a Divine interposition; and let those stumble who are resolved to stumble. It has been supposed to have been the &#8220;whale,&#8221; because the word <a name="iii.1.xxi-p4.2"></A>&#954;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; is used in the reference made to Jonah in <a name="iii.1.xxi-p4.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#040">Mt 12:40</a><a name="iii.1.xxi-p4.3"></A>: but that word 					 is a general term applied to a large fish, and does not necessarily mean the whale. <a name="iii.1.xxi-p4.4"></A>&#954;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962;, says <i>Ribera</i>, in his comment on Jonah, <a name="iii.1.xxi-p4.5"></A>non certae speciei, sed generis nomen est, et piscem quemvis magnum significat. &#8212; <i>Ed. 					 </i></p> 				</P>
