<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.4.i-p7"></A><a name="iv.4.i-p7.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.i-p8"></A>Here Micah begins his address to the faithful, who were a remnant among that people; for though the infection had nearly extended over the whole body, there were yet a few, we know, who sincerely worshipped God. Hence Micah, that he might not dishearten God&#8217;s children by extreme terror, reasonably adds what we have now heard, &#8212; that though for a time the temple would be demolished and laid waste, it would yet be only for a season, for the 				Lord would be again mindful of his covenant. When, therefore, the Prophet had hitherto spoken of God&#8217;s dreadful vengeance, he directed his discourse to the whole people and to the princess; but now, especially, and as it were apart, addresses the pious and sincere servants of God; as though he said, &#8220;There is now a reason why I should speak to the few: I have hitherto spoken of the near judgment of God on the king&#8217;s counselors, the priests and the prophets; in short, on the whole community, 				because they are all become wicked and ungodly; a contempt of God and an irreclaimable obstinacy have pervaded the whole body. Let them therefore have what they have deserved. But now I address the children of God by themselves, for I have something to say to them.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.i-p9"></A>For though the Prophet publicly proclaimed this promise, there is yet no doubt but that he had regard only to the children of God, for others were not capable of receiving this consolation; nay, he had shortly before condemned the extreme security of hypocrites, inasmuch as they leaned upon God; that is, relied on a false pretense of religion, in thinking that they were redeemed by a lawful price when they had offered their sacrifices. And 				we know that we meet with the same thing in the writings of the Prophets, and that it is a practice common among them to add consolations to threatening, not for the sake of the whole people, but to sustain the faithful in their hope, who would have despaired, had not a helping hand been stretched forth to them: for the faithful, we know, tremble, as soon as God manifests any token of wrath; for the more any one is touched with the fear of God, the more he dreads his judgment, and fears on 				account of his threatening. We hence see how necessary it is to moderate threatenings and terrors, when prophets and teachers have a regard to the children of God; for, as I have said, they are without these fearful enough. Let us then know that Micah has hitherto directed his discourse to the wicked despisers of God, who yet put on the cloak of religion; but now he turns his address to the true and pious worshipers of God. And he further so addresses the faithful of his age, that his doctrine 				especially belongs to us now; for how has it been, that the kingdom of God has been propagated through all parts of the earth? How has it been, that the truth of the gospel has come to us, and that we are made partakers with the ancient people of the same adoption, except that this prophecy has been fulfilled? Then the calling of the Gentiles, and consequently our salvation, is included in this prophecy.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.i-p10"></A>But the Prophet says, <i>And it shall be in the extremity of days,</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">114</FONT></A>
 				 <i>that the mount of the house of Jehovah shall be set in order</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">115</FONT></A>
 				 <i>on the top of mountains</i>  The extremity of days the Prophet no doubt calls the coming of Christ, for then it was that the Church of God was built anew; in short, since it was Christ that introduced the renovation of the world, his advent is rightly called a new age; and hence it is also said to be the extremity of days: and this mode of expression 				very frequently occurs in Scripture; and we know that the time of the gospel is expressly called the last days and the last time by John, (<a name="iv.4.i-p12.7"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#018">Joh 2:18</a><a name="iv.4.i-p12.7"></A>,) as well as by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, (<a name="iv.4.i-p12.8"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002">Heb 1:2</a><a name="iv.4.i-p12.8"></A>,) and also by Paul, (<a name="iv.4.i-p12.9"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001">2Ti 3:1</a><a name="iv.4.i-p12.9"></A>;) and this way of speaking they borrowed from the prophets. On this subject some remarks were made on <a name="iv.4.i-p12.10"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#000">Joel 2</a><a name="iv.4.i-p12.10"></A>. Paul gives us the reason for this mode of speaking in <a name="iv.4.i-p12.11"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011">1Co 10:11</a><a name="iv.4.i-p12.11"></A>: &#8220;Upon whom,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the ends of the world are come.&#8221; As Christ then brought in the completion of all 				things at his coming, the Prophet rightly says that it would be the last days when God would restore his Church by the hand of the Redeemer. At the same time, Micah no doubt intended to intimate that the time of God&#8217;s wrath would not be short, but designed to show that its course would be for a long time.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.i-p13"></A><i>It shall</i> then <i>be in the last of days;</i> that is, when the Lord shall have executed his vengeance by demolishing the temple, by destroying the city, and by reducing the holy place into a solitude, 				this dreadful devastation shall continue, not for one year, nor for two; in a word, it will not remain only for forty or fifty years, but the Lord will let loose the reins of his wrath, that their minds may long languish, and that no restoration may be evident. We now then understand the Prophet&#8217;s design as to the last days.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.i-p14"></A>He calls the mount, <i>the mount of the house of Jehovah,</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">116</FONT></A>
 				 in a sense different from what he did before; for then it was, as we have stated by way of concession; and now he sets forth the reason why God did not wish wholly to cast aside that mount; for he commanded his temple to be built there. It is the same, then, as though he said, &#8212; &#8220;This ought not to be ascribed to the holiness of the mountain, as if it excelled other mountains in dignity; but because there the temple was founded, not by the authority of men, but by 				a celestial oracle, as it is sufficiently known.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.i-p16"></A><i>The mount</i> then <i>of the house of Jehovah shall be set in order on the top of the mountains,</i> that is it shall surpass in height all other mountains; <i>and it shall be 				raised,</i> he says<i>, above the highest summits, and assemble</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">117</FONT></A>
 				 <i>there shall all nations.</i> It is certain, that by these words of the Prophet is to be understood no visible eminence of situation: for that mount was not increased at the coming of Christ; and they who lived in the time of the Prophet entertained no gross idea of this kind. But he speaks here of the eminence of dignity, &#8212; that God would give to mount Zion a distinction so 				eminent, that all other mountains would yield to its honor. And how was this done? The explanation follows in the next verse. Lest, then, any one thought that there would be some visible change in mount Zion, that it would increase in size, the Prophet immediately explains what he meant and says, at the end of the verse, Come shall nations to God. It is now easy to see what its elevation was to be, &#8212; that God designed this mount to be, as it were, a royal seat. As under the monarchy of the king 				of Persia, the whole of the east, we know, was subject to one tower of the Persian; so also, when mount Zion became the seat of sovereign power, God designed to reign there, and there he designed that the whole world should be subject to him; and this is the reason and the Prophet said that it would be higher than all other mountains. Hence his meaning, in this expression, is sufficiently evident.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.4.i-p26"></A><a name="iv.4.i-p26.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.i-p27"></A>There follows, however, a fuller explanation, when he says, that <i>many nations would come</i>  He said only before that nations would come: but as David, even in his age, made some nations tributary to himself, the Prophet here expresses something more, &#8212; that <i>many nations would come;</i> as if he had said, &#8220;Though David subjugated some people to himself, yet the borders of his kingdom were narrow and confined, compared with the largeness of that kingdom which the Lord will establish at the coming of his Messiah: for not a few nations but many shall assemble to serve him, and shall say,&#8221; etc. The Prophet now shows that it would be a spiritual kingdom. When David subdued the 				Moabites and the Amorites, and others, he imposed a certain tribute to be paid annually but he was not able to establish among them the pure and legitimate worship of God, nor was he able to unite them in one faith. Then the Moabites and other nations, though they paid a tribute to David, did not yet worship the true God, but continued ever alienated from the Church. But our Prophet shows that the kingdom, which God would set up at the coming of the Messiah, would be spiritual.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.i-p28"></A>For they shall say,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">118</FONT></A>
 				 <i>Let us you and ascend to the mount of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for, go </i>  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">119</FONT></A>
 				<i> forth shall a law from Zion, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem</i>  Throughout this passage the Prophet teaches us, that people are not to be constrained by an armed force, or by the power of the sword, to submit to David&#8217;s posterity, but that they are to be really and thoroughly reformed, so that they submit themselves to God, unite with the body of the Church, and become 				one people with the children of Abraham; for they will yield a voluntary service, and embracing the teaching of the Law, they will renounce their own superstitions. This then is the Prophet&#8217;s meaning. But the remainder we shall defer till to-morrow.</p>  <a name="iv.4.ii"></A>  			 
<p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld29"><a name="iv.4.ii-p1"></A>Prayer.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.ii-p2"></A>Grant, Almighty God that as thou hast been pleased to erect the throne of thy Son among us, we may rely on his protection and learn to resign ourselves wholly to thee, and never turn aside here and there, but with tulle obedience so submit ourselves to the King who has been appointed by thee, that he may own us as his legitimate people, and so glorify thy name, that we may not at the same time profane it by an ungodly and wicked life, but testify by 				our works that we are really thy subjects. and that thou attains full authority over us, so that thy name may be sanctified and thy Spirit may really guide us, until at length thy Son, who has gathered us when we were awfully gone astray, gather us again to that kingdom, which he as purchased for us by his own blood. Amen.</p>  <a name="iv.4.iii"></A>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref25"><a name="iv.4.iii-p1"></A>Lecture Eighty-eighth</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iii-p2"></A>We began yesterday to explain the prophecy, in which Micah promises the restoration of the Church. We have said that this promise cannot be understood except of Christ&#8217;s kingdom, for it refers to the last days. And it was also added, that the superiority and eminence of mount Zion, of which he speaks, cannot be otherwise understood than of God&#8217;s spiritual kingdom; for the explanation follows, when he says, that many nations would come to 				be taught in the ways of the Lord. We hence see that an earthly empire is not what is here predicted, but what exists through the word and celestial doctrine. But each particular ought to be considered by us. We yesterday said, that in the distinct mention made of many nations, there is to be understood a contrast; for till that time God was only known by one people. Since God then had chosen the race of Abraham alone, there is here pointed out a future change, when he shall gather his Church 				from various nations, so as to do away with the difference between the Gentiles and the Jews.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iii-p3"></A>It now follows, <i>They shall say, Come, and let us ascend to the mount of Jehovah</i>  The Prophet shows in these words that not only each one would be obedient to God, when called, but that they would also encourage one another: and this ardor is what is justly required in the faithful; they ought to animate and 				stir on one another; for it is not enough for each of us himself to obey God, but this zeal ought to be added, by which we may strive to produce a mutual benefit. This concern then is what the Prophet now refers to, when he says, &#8220;Come, that we may ascend to the mountain of the Lord.&#8221; He might have said, that people would come, and there close his sentence; but he wished to join the two clauses, &#8212; that they, who had before despised the God of Israel, would come from all parts, &#8212; and also that 				they would become exhorters to one another. Come then that we may ascend. But the manner of the exhortation deserves to be noticed; for each one offers himself as a companion in the journey. We indeed see that many are prompt enough, when others are to be stimulated in their duty; but they at the same time lie still; their whole fervor is consumed in sending others, and they themselves move not, no, not a finger; so far are they from running with alacrity in company with others. The Prophet 				shows here, that the faithful will be so solicitous about the salvation of their brethren that they will strenuously run themselves, and that they will prescribe nothing to others but what they themselves perform. Come then that we may ascend; they say not, &#8220;Go, ascend to the mount of Jehovah;&#8221; but, Let us go together.&#8221; It is then the right way of encouraging, when we really show that we require nothing from our brethren but what we desire to do ourselves.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iii-p4"></A>The circumstance of time must now be noticed; for what the Prophet says respecting the nations coming into mount Zion, as it was to be reduced to a waste, might have appeared a fable; for what had he shortly before predicted? That Zion would be plowed as a field, and that trees would grow there, that it would become a wild forest. How then could it be, that many nations would flow to it as to a most renowned place, as it was to be reduced 				to a dreadful desolation? But the Prophet here extols the wonderful power of God, &#8212; that in this wild and desert place there would at length be raised a noble and a celebrated temple, where God would show mercy to his own people. Hence he promises what this mount of Jehovah would be, which was for a time to be forsaken; and that there would be, as formerly, a noble temple in the place, where desolation had for a season existed.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iii-p5"></A>It afterwards follows, <i>And he will teach us of his ways.</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">120</FONT></A>
 				 Here the Prophet in a few words defines the legitimate worship of God: for it would not be sufficient for the nations to come together into one place to profess the one true God, unless true obedience followed, which rests on faith, as faith does on the word. It ought then to be especially noticed, that the Prophet sets here the word of God before us, in order to show that true religion is founded on the obedience of faith, and that God cannot be truly worshipped, 				except when he himself teaches his people, and prescribes to them what is necessary to be done. Hence when the will of God is revealed to us, we then can truly worship him. When the word is again taken away, there will indeed be some form of divine worship; but there will be no genuine religion, such as is pleasing to God. And hence we also learn, that there is no other way of raising up the Church of God than by the light of the word, in which God himself, by his own voice, points out the way 				of salvation. Until then the truth shines, men cannot be united together, so as to form a true Church.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iii-p7"></A>Since it is so, it follows, that where the truth is either corrupted or despised, there is no religion, at least such as is approved by God. Men may indeed boast of the name with their lips: but there is no true religion before God, except it be formed according to the rule of his word. It hence also follows, that there is no Church, except it be obedient to the word of God, and be guided by it: for the prophet defines 				here what true religion is, and also how God collects a Church for himself. <i>He will</i> then <i>teach us of his ways</i>  And a third particular may be added, &#8212; that God is robbed of his right and of his honor, when mortals assume to themselves the authority to teach; for it 				is to God alone that this office of teaching his people can strictly be ascribed. (<i>proprie tribuitur.</i>) There were then priests and prophets, yet Micah here brings them down to their proper state, and shows that the right and the office of teaching would be in the power of the only true God. We hence see that God claims this office for himself, that we may not be tossed to and fro, and led astray by various teachers, but continue in simple 				obedience to his word, so that he alone may be the Supreme. In short, God is not the God and Head of the Church, except he be the chief and the only Teacher.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iii-p8"></A>Wheat he now says, &#8220;He will teach us of his ways,&#8221; ought to be thus understood. He will teach us what his ways are; as though the Prophet had said, that the perfect wisdom of men is to understand what pleases God, and what is his will: for there is nothing farther to be learnt.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iii-p9"></A>It follows, <i>And we will walk in his paths</i>. By this clause we are reminded, that the truth of God is not, as they say, speculative, but full of energizing power. God then not only speaks to the end that every one may acknowledge that to be true which proceeds from him, but at the same time he demands obedience. Hence we shall then 				only be the disciples of God, when we walk in his ways: for if we only nod with our ears, as asses are wont to do, and assent to what God says with our mouth and lips, it is extremely vain and absurd. It is therefore then only that men really profit under the teaching of God, when they form their life according to his doctrine, and be prepared with their feet to walk, and to follow whithersoever be may call them. <i>We 				will</i> then <i>walk in his paths</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iii-p10"></A>Micah had hitherto related only what the faithful would do; he now himself confirms the same truth, <i>For from Zion shall go forth a law,</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">121</FONT></A>
 				 <i>and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.</i> Here is a reason given why many nations would come to the temple of the Lord; and that is, because a doctrine would be then promulgated, which had been before heard only in one place. We indeed know that the Jews came to the temple, not only to worship, but also to be instructed in the Law of God. The Law then had at that time, as it 				were, its habitation in Zion: there was the sanctuary of celestial wisdom. But what does our Prophet say? A law shall go forth from Zion, that is, it shall be proclaimed far and wide: the Lord will show, not only in one corner, what true religion is, and how he seeks to be worshipped, but he will send forth his voice to the extreme limits of the earth. <i>A law</i> then 				<i>shall go forth from Zion,</i> according to what is said in <a name="iv.4.iii-p12.7"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#000">Ps 110</a><a name="iv.4.iii-p12.7"></A>,</p>  			 
<p class="Center"><a name="iv.4.iii-p13"></A>&#8216;the scepter of thy power the Lord will send forth from Zion.&#8217;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iii-p14"></A>In that passage the doctrine of Christ is metaphorically called a scepter, or is compared to a royal scepter; for Christ does not otherwise rule among us, than by the doctrine of his Gospel: and there David declares, that this scepter would be sent far abroad by God the Father, that Christ might have under his rule all those nations which had been previously aliens. Such is the meaning in this place, <i>A law from Zion shall go 				forth</i>  Then it follows, <i>The word of Jehovah from Jerusalem</i>  This is a repetition of the same sentiment, which is often the case. Then by <a name="iv.4.iii-p14.1"></A>&#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, <i>ture</i>, the Prophet 				means no other thing than doctrine: but, by another term, he confirms the same thing, that is that God would be heard not only at Jerusalem and in Judea, but that he would make his word to be proclaimed everywhere. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iv.4.iv"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption26"><a name="iv.4.iv-p1"></A><a name="iv.4.iv-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003">Micah 4:3</a><a name="iv.4.iv-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.4.iv-p2"></A><b>3.</b> And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.4.iv-p3"></A><b>3. </b>Et judicabit inter populos multos, et arguet (vel, corripiet) gentes robustos usque in longinquum, et concident gladios suos in vomeres, et lanceas suas in falces: non tollent gens contra gentem gladium, et non assuescent ultra praelio.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iv-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.4.iv-p5"></A><a name="iv.4.iv-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iv-p6"></A>The Prophet here describes the fruit of Divine truth, &#8212; that God would restore all nations to such gentleness, that they would study to cultivate fraternal peace among themselves, and that all would consult the good of others, having laid aside every desire for doing harm. As then he has lately showed, that the Church of God could not be otherwise formed than by the Word, and that the legitimate worship of God cannot be set up and 				continued, except where God is honored with the obedience of faith; so now he shows that Divine truth produces this effect, &#8212; that they, who before lived in enmity towards one another and burned with the lust of doing harm, being full of cruelty and avarice, will now, having their disposition changed, devote themselves wholly to acts of kindness. But, before the Prophet comes to this subject, he says, &#8212;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iv-p7"></A><i>He will judge</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">122</FONT></A>
 				 <i>among many people, and will reprove strong nations.</i> The word judge, in Hebrew, means the same as to rule or govern. It is certain that God is spoken of here: it is then the same as though the Prophet had said that though the nations had not hitherto obeyed God, they would now own him as king and submit to his government. God has indeed ever governed the world by his hidden 				providence, as he does still govern it: for how much soever the devil and the ungodly may rage; nay, how ever much they may boil with unbridled fury, there is no doubt but that God restrains and checks their madness by his hidden bridle. But the Scripture speaks of God&#8217;s kingdom in two respects. God does indeed govern the devil and all the wicked, but not by his word, nor by the sanctifying power of his Spirit: it is so done, that they obey God, not willingly, but against their will. The 				peculiar government of God is that of his Church only, where, by his word and Spirit, He bends the hearts of men to obedience, so that they follow him voluntarily and willingly, being taught inwardly and outwardly, &#8212; inwardly by the influence of the Spirit, &#8212; outwardly by the preaching of the word. Hence it is said in <a name="iv.4.iv-p9.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#000">Psalm 110</a><a name="iv.4.iv-p9.2"></A>, &#8216;Thy willing people shall then assemble.&#8217; This is the government that is here described by the Prophet; God then <i>shall judge;</i> not as he judges the world, but he will, in a peculiar manner, make them obedient to himself so that they will look for nothing else than to be wholly devoted to him.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iv-p10"></A>But as men must first be subdued before they render to God such obedience, the Prophet expressly adds, <i>And he will reprove (corripiet)</i> or convince <i>(arguet) many people</i>. And this sentence 				ought to be carefully noticed; for we hence learn, that such is our innate pride, that not one of us can become a fit disciple to God, except we be by force subdued. Truth then would of itself freeze amidst such corruption as we have, except the Lord proved us guilty, except he prepared us beforehand, as it were, by violent measures. We now then perceive the design of the Prophet in connecting reproof with the government of God: for the verb <a name="iv.4.iv-p10.1"></A>&#1497;&#1499;&#1495;, <i>ikech,</i> signifies sometimes to expostulate, to convince, and sometimes to correct or reprove.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">123</FONT></A>
 				 In short, the wickedness and perversity of our flesh are here implied; for even the best of us would never offer themselves to God, without being first subdued, and that by God&#8217;s powerful correction. This, then, is the beginning of the kingdom of Christ.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iv-p12"></A>But when he says, that <i>strong nations</i> would be reproved, he hereby eulogizes and sets forth the character of the kingdom of which he speaks: and we hence learn the power of truth, &#8212; that strong men, when thus reproved, shall offer themselves, without any resistance, to be ruled by God. Correction is indeed necessary, but God 				employs no external force, nor any armed power, when he makes the Church subject to himself: and yet he collects strong nations. Hence then is seen the power of truth: for where there is strength, there is confidence and arrogance, and also rebellious opposition. Since then the Lord, without any other helps, thus corrects the perverseness of men, we hence see with what inconceivable power God works, when he gathers his own Church. It is to be added, that there is not the least doubt, but that 				this is to be applied to the person of Christ. Micah speaks of God, without mentioning Christ by name; for he was not yet manifested in the flesh: but we know that in his person has this been fulfilled, &#8212; that God has governed the universe, and subjected to himself the people of the whole world. We hence conclude that Christ is true God; for he is not only a minister to the Father, as Moses, or any one of the Prophets; but he is the supreme King of his Church.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iv-p13"></A>Before I proceed to notice the fruit, the expression, <a name="iv.4.iv-p13.1"></A>&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; &#1506;&#1491;, <i>od rechuk,</i> &#8220;afar off&#8221; must be observed. It may intimate a length of time as well as distance of place. Jonathan applies it to a long continuance of time, &#8212; that God would convince men to the end of the 				world. But the Prophet, I doubt not, intended to include the most distant countries; as though he had said, that God would not be the king of one people only, or of Judea alone, but that his kingdom would be propagated to the extremities of the earth. <i>He will</i> then <i>convince</i> people <i>afar off</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iv-p14"></A>He afterward adds, with respect to the fruit, <i>They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks</i>  I have already briefly explained the meaning of the Prophet: he in fact shows that when the nations should be taught by the word of God, there would be such a change, that every 				one would study to do good, and to perform the duties of love towards his neighbors. But by speaking of swords and spears he briefly intimates, what men, until they are made gentle by the word of the Lord, are ever intent on iniquitous tyranny and oppression; nor can it be otherwise, while every one follows his own nature; for there are none who are not wedded to their own advantages, and the cupidity of men is insatiable. As then all are thus intent on gain, while every one is blinded by 				self-love, what but cruelty must ever break forth from this wicked principle? Hence then it is, that men cannot cultivate peace with one another; for every one seeks to be the first, and draws every thing to himself; no one will willingly give way: then dissensions arise, and from dissensions, fightings. This is what the Prophet intimates. And then he adds, that the fruit of the doctrine of Christ would however be such, that men, who were before like cruel wild beasts, would become gentle and 				meek. <i>Forge</i> then <i>shall they their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks.</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iv-p15"></A><i>Raise,</i> he says, <i>shall not a nation a sword against a nation, and accustom themselves they shall no more to war</i>  He explains here more fully what I have before said, &#8212; that the Gospel of Christ would be to the nations, as it were, a standard of peace: as when a banner is raised up, 				soldiers engage in battle, and their fury is kindled; so Micah ascribes a directly opposite office to the Gospel of Christ, &#8212; that it will restore those to the cultivation of peace and concord, who before were given to acts of hostility. For when he says, &#8216;Raise a sword shall not a nation against nation,&#8217; he intimates, as I have already stated, that wherever Christ does not reign, men are wolves to men, for every one is disposed to devour all others. Hence as men are naturally impelled by so 				blind an impulse, the Prophet declares, that this madness cannot be corrected, that men will not cease from wars, that they will not abstain from hostilities, until Christ becomes their teacher: for by the word <a name="iv.4.iv-p15.1"></A>&#1500;&#1502;&#1491;, <i>lamed,</i> he implies, that it is a practice which ever prevails among mankind, that they contend with one another, that they are 				ever prepared to do injuries and wrongs, except when they put off their natural disposition. But gentleness, whence does it proceed? Even from the teaching of the Gospel.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iv-p16"></A>This passage ought to be remembered; for we here learn, that there is not growing among us the real fruit of the Gospel, unless we exercise mutual love and benevolence, and exert ourselves in doing good. Though the Gospel is at this day purely preached among us, when yet we consider how little progress we make in brotherly love, we ought justly to be ashamed of our indolence. God proclaims daily that he is reconciled to us in his Son; 				Christ testifies, that he is our peace with God, that he renders him propitious to us, for this end, that we may live as brethren together. We indeed wish to be deemed the children of God, and we wish to enjoy the reconciliation obtained for us by the blood of Christ; but in the meantime we tear one another, we sharpen our teeth, our dispositions are cruel. If then we desire really to prove ourselves to be the disciples of Christ, we must attend to this part of divine truth, each of us must 				strive to do good to his neighbors. But this cannot be done without being opposed by our flesh; for we have a strong propensity to self-love, and are inclined to seek too much our own advantages. We must therefore put off these inordinate and sinful affections, that brotherly kindness may succeed in their place.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iv-p17"></A>We are also reminded that it is not enough for any one to refrain from doing harm, unless he be also occupied in doing good to his brethren. The Prophet might indeed have said only They shall break their swords and their spears; so that they shall hereafter abstain from doing any hurt to others: this only is not what he says; but, &#8220;They shall forge,&#8221; or beat,&#8221; their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks;&#8221; that is, 				when they shall abstain from all injuries they will seek to exercise themselves in the duties of love, consistently with what Paul says, when he exhorts those who had stolen to steal no more, but to work with their own hands, that they might relieve others (<a name="iv.4.iv-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#028">Eph 4:28</a><a name="iv.4.iv-p17.1"></A>.) Except then we endeavor to relieve the necessities of our brethren, and to offer them assistance, there will not be in us but one part 				of true conversion, as the case is with many, who are not indeed inhuman, who commit no plunder, who give no occasion for complaint, but they live to themselves, and enjoy unprofitable leisure. This indolence the Prophet here indirectly condemns, when he speaks of the plowshares and the pruning hooks.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iv-p18"></A>Again, a question may be here asked, &#8212; Was this fulfilled at the coming of Christ? It seems that the Prophet does not describe here the state of the Church for a time, but shows what would be the kingdom of Christ to the end. But we see, that when the Gospel was at first preached, the whole world boiled with wars more than ever; and now, though the Gospel in many parts is clearly preached, yet discords and contentions do not cease; we also 				see that rapacity, ambition, and insatiable avarice, greatly prevail; and hence arise contentions and bloody wars. And at the same time it would have been inconsistent in the Prophet to have thus spoken of the kingdom of Christ, had not God really designed to perform what is here predicted. My answer to this is, &#8212; that as the kingdom of Christ was only begun in the world, when God commanded the Gospel to be everywhere proclaimed, and as at this day its course is not as yet completed; so that 				which the Prophet says here has not hitherto taken place; but inasmuch as the number of the faithful is small, and the greater part despise and reject the Gospel, so it happens, that plunders and hostilities continue in the world. How so? Because the Prophet speaks here only of the disciples of Christ. He shows the fruit of his doctrine, that wherever it strikes a living root, it brings forth fruit: but the doctrine of the Gospel strikes roots hardly in one out of a hundred.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="#fn_123"><FONT SIZE="1">124</FONT></A>
 				The measure also of its progress must be taken to the account; for so far as any one embraces the doctrine of the Gospel, so far he becomes gentle and seeks to do good to his neighbors. But as we as yet carry about us the relics of sin in our flesh, and as our knowledge of the Gospel is not yet perfect, it is no wonder, that not one of us has hitherto wholly laid aside the depraved and sinful affections of his flesh.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iv-p20"></A>It is also easy hence to see, how foolish is the conceit of those, who seek to take away the use of the sword, on account of the Gospel. The Anabaptists, we know, have been turbulent, as though all civil order were inconsistent with the kingdom of Christ, as though the kingdom of Christ was made up of doctrine only, and that doctrine without any influence. We might indeed do without the sword, were we angels in this world; but the number 				of the godly, as I have already said, is small; it is therefore necessary that the rest of the people should be restrained by a strong bridle; for the children of God are found mixed together, either with cruel monsters or with wolves and rapacious men. Some are indeed openly rebellious, others are hypocrites. The use of the sword will therefore continue to the end of the world.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.iv-p21"></A>We must now understand that at the time our Prophet delivered this discourse, Isaiah had used the very same words, (<a name="iv.4.iv-p21.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004">Isa 2:4</a><a name="iv.4.iv-p21.1"></A>:) and it is probable that Micah was a disciple of Isaiah. They, however, exercised at the same time the Prophetic office, though Isaiah was the oldest. But Micah was not ashamed to follow 				Isaiah and to borrow his words; for he was not given to self ostentation, as though he would not adduce any thing but what was his own; but he designedly adopted the expressions of Isaiah, and related verbally what he had said, to show that there was a perfect agreement between him and that illustrious minister of God, that his doctrine might obtain more credit. We hence see how great was the simplicity of our Prophet, and that he did not regard what malevolent and perverse men might say: 				&#8220;What! he only repeats the words of another.&#8221; Such a calumny he wholly disregarded; and he thought it enough to show that he faithfully declared what God had commanded. Though we have not the <a name="iv.4.iv-p21.2"></A>&#1506;&#1491; &#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511;, <i>od rechuk,</i> in Isaiah, yet the meaning is the same: in all other things they agree. It now follows&#8212;</p>  <a name="iv.4.v"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption26"><a name="iv.4.v-p1"></A><a name="iv.4.v-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004">Micah 4:4</a><a name="iv.4.v-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.4.v-p2"></A><b>4.</b> But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make <i>them</i> afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken <i>it</i></p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.4.v-p3"></A><b>4. </b>Et sedebunt (hoc est, quiescent, vel, quieti habitabunt) quisque sub vite sua et sub ficn sua; et nemo erit qui exterreat; quia os Jehovae exercituum loquutum est.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="iv.4.v-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.4.v-p5"></A><a name="iv.4.v-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.v-p6"></A>Micah goes on here with the same subject, &#8212; that when the minds of men shall be disposed to acts of kindness, every one shall enjoy God&#8217;s blessing without being disturbed. There seems indeed to be two things here included, &#8212; that acts of hostility shall cease, &#8212; and that real happiness cannot exist among men, except Christ rules among them by the doctrine of his Gospel. And the same thing the prophets teach elsewhere, that is, that every one 				shall live without fear; and this they do, in order to show that men ever live in a miserable dread, except when they are safe under the protection of God. It is the same thing as though the Prophet had said, that the life of men is most miserable, where the doctrine of the Gospel is not had, inasmuch as when they are disturbed by continual disquietude, every one fears for himself, every one suffers constant terrors. There is nothing more miserable than such a state of things, for peace is the 				chief good.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.v-p7"></A>We now then understand the meaning of the Prophet to be, &#8212; that under the reign of Christ the faithful shall enjoy true and full happiness, as they shall be exempt from trembling and fear; hence he names the vine and the fig-tree. He might have said, &#8220;Every one shall live securely at home;&#8221; but he says, <i>Every one shall rest under his own fig-tree and under his own 				vine;</i> that is, though exposed to thieves, he shall yet fear no violence, no injury; for those who were thieves shall observe what is just and right; those who were bloody shall study to do good. Hence when no one closes the door of his house, yea, when he goes out into the fields and sleeps in the open air; he will still be safe and secure. We now then see why the Prophet mentions here the fig-tree and the vine, rather than the 				dwelling-house.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.v-p8"></A><i>And there will be no one to terrify them.</i> What the Prophet designed to express is here more clearly specified, &#8212; that there would be no danger, and that there would therefore be no need of hiding-places or of any defenses. Why? Because the very fields, he says, will be free from every thing that may hurt, as there will be none to cause fear. And the Prophet 				seems to allude to the blessing promised in the Law, for Moses used nearly the very same words: and the Prophets, we know, drew many things from the Law; for their design was to retain the people in its doctrine, and to render it as familiar as possible to them. As then Moses promised, among other things, this security,</p>  			 
<p class="Center"><a name="iv.4.v-p9"></A>&#8216;Ye shall sleep, and none shall terrify you,&#8217; (<a name="iv.4.v-p9.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#006">Le 26:6</a><a name="iv.4.v-p9.1"></A>;)</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.v-p10"></A>so the Prophet also, in speaking here of the kingdom of Christ, shows that this blessing would be then fully accomplished.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.v-p11"></A>He now at last subjoins, <i>The mouth of Jehovah hath</i> thus <i>spoken,</i> that he might confirm what seemed incredible: for, as I have already said, since he had shortly before predicted the devastation 				of mount Zion and the ruin of the temple, it seemed very improbable that the nations would come there to worship God. But he declares that the mouth of God had thus spoken, that the faithful might overcome all obstacles and struggle against despair; though they saw the temple destroyed, the mount Zion desolated, though they saw a horrible waste and wild beasts occupying the place of men; they were yet to continue to entertain firm hope. &#8212; How so? Because Jehovah has made a promise and he will 				fulfill it: for when mention is made of God&#8217;s mouth, his omnipotence is to be understood by which will be executed whatever he has promised.</p>  <a name="iv.4.vi"></A>  			 
<p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld29"><a name="iv.4.vi-p1"></A>Prayer.</p>

<p><a name="iv.4.viii-p6"></A>Micah, after having spoken of the restoration of the Church, now confirms the same truth, and shows that the faithful would have reason enough to cleave constantly to their God, and to despise all the superstitions of the world, and that though they may be tossed here and there by contrary opinions, they will yet continue in true religion. This verse then is connected with the kingdom of Christ; for until we are gathered, and Christ 				shines among us and rules us by his word, there can be in us no constancy, no firmness. But when under the auspices of Christ, we join together in one body the Church, such then becomes the constancy of our faith, that nothing can turn us from the right course, though new storms were at any time to arise, by which the whole world might be shaken, and though it were to happen that the universe should be agitated or pass away. We now understand what the Prophet means.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.viii-p7"></A>He therefore says, <i>All nations shall walk every one in the name of his god.</i> This sentence must be thus explained, &#8212; &#8220;Though nations be divided into various sects, and each be addicted to their own superstitions, yet we shall continue firm in the pure worship of God and in unity of faith.&#8221; But this 				question occurs, how could the Prophet say that there would be such discords in the world, when he had shortly before spoken of the Church being gathered and united together? for he had said, Come shall all nations, and each will say, Come, let us ascend into the mount of Jehovah. There seems to be here some sort of inconsistency, &#8212; that all nations would come to mount Zion, and yet that every people would have their own gods. But the solution is not difficult: the Prophet in this verse 				strengthens the faithful, until Christ should be revealed to the world: nor is there any doubt but the Prophet intended to sustain the confidence of the godly, who might have otherwise been overwhelmed a hundred times with despair. When the children of Israel were driven into exile, when their inheritance was taken away from them, when the temple had been demolished, when, in a word, no visible religion existed, they might, as I have said, have desponded, had not this promise come to their 				minds, &#8212; that God would restore mount Zion, and gather a Church from the whole world. But there was also need of some confirmation, and this is what the Prophet now subjoins. Hence he says, &#8220;Since the Lord gives you hope of so glorious a restoration, you ought to feel confidence. and, in reliance on his promise, to continue in his true worship, how much soever the Gentiles may serve their own idols, and boast that they have the true God. However, then, every one of the nations may take pride in 				their superstitions, you ought not to fluctuate, nor turn here and there, like reeds, which are tossed to and fro, as the wind changes; but ye shall continue firm and steady in your course; for ye know that God is true, who has once for all adopted you, and has promised that your salvation will be the object of his care, even when the world shall think you to be ruined and lost.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.viii-p8"></A>We hence see that what the Prophet had in view was to raise up into confidence the minds of the godly in the midst not only of troubles, but of utter confusion. <i>All nations</i> then <i>shall walk,</i> that is, when the 				temple and the city shall be demolished, and the people be led into distant exile, the ungodly will, at the same time, triumph, every one will extol his own gods: though our God should not then appear, there will yet be no reason why we should be discouraged; but we ought to recomb on his word. <i>We shall then walk in the name of our God, and that for ever and ever;</i> that is, 				though it should happen that the world should a hundred times be turned and turned over again, there shall yet be no change in our minds: for as the truth of God is eternal, so also our faith ought to be constant and never to vary. Now the difficulty is removed, and we see how these two things agree, &#8212; that all nations shall come and with one consent worship God, and yet that to each of them there would be their own gods: for the diversity of time must be here regarded, when all nations would 				walk every one in the name of his god.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">125</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.viii-p14"></A>By saying, <a name="iv.4.viii-p14.1"></A>&#1488;&#1497;&#1513; &#1489;&#1513;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;, <i>aish beshem Aleiu,</i> he touches, in an indirect way, on that variety which exists among men. Though all of them pertinaciously follow and defend their own superstitions yet each one fabricates a goal for himself. Thus it happens, that 				nothing is certain, for they follow only their own inventions. But this the Prophet meant only to touch by the way. His main object was that which I have stated, &#8212; that though the Church of God would be small, and should find a great multitude opposed to it, it ought not yet to succumb. We know how violent a thing is public consent; for when the majority conspire together, the small number, who entertain a different opinion, are, as it were instantly swallowed up. It is not then without reason 				that the Prophet exhorts the faithful here to an invincible firmness of mind, that they might triumph over all the nations. However small, then, might be the faithful in number, the Prophet wished them to look down, as it were from a higher place, not only on a large multitudes but on all mankind. Though then <i>all nations walk, etc.</i>: nor is the word 				<a name="iv.4.viii-p14.2"></A>&#1499;&#1500;, <i>cal</i>, all, superfluous, &#8212; though <i>all nations shall walk,</i> <i>etc.</i> There was then but one nation, the offspring of Abraham, among whom true 				religion existed; and it was a dreadful devastation, when God suffered the royal city and the temple to be pulled down, and the whole body of the people to be torn asunder, to be driven away here and there, so that no kingdom and no kind of civil community remained. Hence the Prophet intimates here, that though the faithful should find that in number and dignity they were far surpassed by their enemies, they yet should not despair. &#8220;Though then all the nations walked, every one in the name of 				their god, &#8212; though every people set up their superstitions against you, and all conspired against you together, yet stand ye firm and proceed in your course, and this not for a short time, but for ever and ever.&#8221;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">126</FONT></A>
 				 Now this passage shows that faith depends not on the suffrages of men, and that we ought not to regard what any one may think, or what may be the consent of all; for the truth of God alone ought to be deemed sufficient by us. How much soever, then, the whole world may oppose God, our faith ought not to be changeable, but remain firm on this strong foundation, &#8212; that God, who cannot deceive, has spoken. This is one thing. Then, in the second place, it must be 				added, that this firmness ought to be perpetual. Though then Satan may excite against us new troubles, since we have hitherto stood firm as to our faith in God&#8217;s word, let us proceed in the same course to the end. And the Prophet designedly added this verse; because he saw that the people would be subject to various and long-continued temptations. It was a long captivity: hence languor might have, as it were, wasted away all the confidence which the people then had. And further, after they 				returned from exile, we know how often and how grievously their faith was tried, when all their neighbors inimically assailed them, and when they were afterwards oppressed by cruel tyranny. This was the reason why the Prophet said that the children of God are to <i>walk perpetually and to the end in his name</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.viii-p16"></A>Though he gives the name of gods to the idols of the nations he yet shows that there is a great and striking difference; for the nations worship their own gods, which they had invented: or how did they derive their majesty and their power, except from the false imagination of men? But the Prophet says, <i>We will walk in the name of Jehovah our 				God.</i> He hence shows that the power and authority of God is not founded on any vain device of men, for he of himself exists, and will exist, though he were denied by the whole world. And this also confirms what I have already stated, &#8212; that the faithful ought thus to embrace the word of God, as they know that they have not to do with men, the credit of whom is doubtful and inconstant, but with him who is the true God, who cannot lie, and whose truth is 				immutable.

<p><a name="iv.4.ix-p8"></A>The Prophet pursues the same subject. But we must ever remember what I have previously reminded you of, &#8212; that the trials would be so grievous and violent that there would be need of strong and uncommon remedies; for the faithful might have been a hundred times sunk, as it were, in the deepest gulfs, except they had been supported by various means. This then is the reason why the Prophet confirms so fully the truth which we have noticed 				respecting the restoration of the Church.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.ix-p9"></A><i>In that day,</i> he says, <i>I will gather the halting</i>  This metaphor is not only found here; for David sage that his own affliction was like that of halting. The word <a name="iv.4.ix-p9.1"></A>&#1510;&#1500;&#1506;&#1492;, <i>tsaloe,</i> means the side: hence they metaphorically call those halters who walk only on one side: it is the same as though he had said, that they were maimed or weak.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">127</FONT></A>
 				 He then adds, <i>I will assemble the ejected, whom I have afflicted.</i> In the next verse he repeats the same, I will make the halting, he says, a remnant; that is, I will make her who is now halting to remain alive, and her who is cast afar off,<i> a strong nation</i>. 				Some explain <a name="iv.4.ix-p10.1"></A>&#1488;&#1504;&#1488;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">128</FONT></A>
 				 <i>enelae,</i> in a more refined manner, and say that it means, She who is gone before; as though the Prophet said, God will sustain the halting, and to those who are lively he will add strength. But this exposition is too strained. We see that the context will not admit it; for the Prophet brings forward the Church here as afflicted by the hand of God, and nigh utter ruin: and then, on the other hand, he intimates, that 				it was to be restored by God&#8217;s power, and that it would thereby gather new strength, and flourish as before: he therefore calls the Church as one cast far away, as in the previous verse; and the other verse clearly shows, that the Prophet&#8217;s design was no other but to point out the twofold state of the Church.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.ix-p12"></A>Now, in the first place, we must observe, that the Prophet meets the trial then present, which must have otherwise depressed the hearts of the godly. He saw that they were in a manner broken down; and then their dispersion was as it were a symbol of final ruin. If then the faithful had their minds continually fixed on that spectacle, they might have a hundred times despaired. The Prophet therefore comes here seasonably to their help, and 				reminds them, that though they were now halting, there was yet in God new vigor; that though they were scattered, it was yet in God&#8217;s power to gather those who had been driven afar off. The meaning briefly is, that though the Church differed nothing for a time from a dead man, or at least from one that is maimed, no despair ought to be entertained; for the Lord sometimes raises up his people, as though he raised the dead from the grave: and this fact ought to be carefully noticed, for as soon 				as the Church of God does not shine forth, we think that it is wholly extinct and destroyed. But the Church is so preserved in the world, that it sometimes rises again from death: in short, the preservation of the Church, almost every day, is accompanied with many miracles.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.ix-p13"></A>But we ought to bear in mind, that the life of the Church is not without a resurrection, nay, it is not without many resurrections, if the expression be allowed. This we learn from the words of the Prophet, when he says, &#8216;I will then gather the halting, and assemble the driven away;&#8217; and then he adds, &#8216;and her whom I have with evils afflicted.&#8217; And this has been expressly said, that the faithful may know, that God can bring out of the 				grave those whom he has delivered to death. For if the Jews had been destroyed at the pleasure of their enemies, they could not have hoped for so certain a remedy from God: but when they acknowledged that nothing happened to them except through the just judgment of God, they could entertain hope of restoration. How so? Because it is what is peculiar to God to bring forth the dead, as I have already said, from the grave; as it is also his work to kill. We then see that what the Prophet promised, 				respecting the restoration of the Church, is confirmed by this verse: I am he, says God, who has afflicted; cannot I again restore you to life? For as your death is in my hand, so also is your salvation. If the Assyrians or the Chaldeans had gained the victory over you against my will, there would be some difficulty in my purpose of gathering you; but as nothing has happened but by my command, and as I have proved that your salvation and your destruction is in my power, there is no reason for 				you to think that it is difficult for me to gather you, who have through my judgment been dispersed.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.4.ix-p14"></A><a name="iv.4.ix-p14.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.ix-p15"></A>He then adds, <i>I will make the halting a remnant</i>  By remnant he understands the surviving Church. Hence the metaphor, halting, is extended even to destruction; as though he said, &#8220;Though the Jews for a time may differ nothing from dead men, I will yet cause them to rise again, that they may become again a 				new people.&#8221; It was difficult to believe this at the time of exile: no wonder, then, that the Prophet here promises that a posterity would be born from a people that were dead. For though Babylon was to them like the grave, yet God was able to do such a thing as to bring them forth as new men, as it really happened.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.ix-p16"></A>He afterwards subjoins <i>And the driven afar off, a strong nation</i>  When the Jews were scattered here and there, how was it possible that God should from this miserable devastation form for himself a new people, and also a strong people? But the Prophet has put the contrary clauses in opposition to one 				another, that the Jews, amazed at their own evils, and astonished, might not cast away every consolation. As then he had dispersed them, he would again gather them, and would not only do this, but also make them a strong nation.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.ix-p17"></A>He then adds, <i>Reign shall Jehovah over them on mount Zion, henceforth and for ever</i>  The Prophet no doubt promises here the new restoration of that kingdom which God himself had erected; for the salvation of the people was grounded on this &#8212; that the posterity of David should reign, as we shall hereafter 				see. And it is a common and usual thing with the prophets to set forth the kingdom of David, whenever they speak of the salvation of the Church. It was necessary then that the kingdom of David should be again established, in order that the Church might flourish and be secure. But Micah does not here name the posterity of David, but mentions Jehovah himself, not to exclude the kingdom of David, but to show that God would become openly the founder of that kingdom, yea, that he himself possessed 				the whole power. For though God governed the ancient people by the hand of David, by the hand of Josiah and of Hezekiah, there was yet, as it were, a shade intervening, so that God reigned not then visibly. The Prophet then mentions here some difference between that shadowy kingdom and the latter new kingdom, which, at the coming of the Messiah, God would openly set up. <i>Jehovah himself shall then reign over them;</i> as though he said, &#8220;Hitherto indeed, when the posterity of David held the government, as God himself created both David and his sons, and as they were anointed by his authority and command, it could not have been thought but that the kingdom was his, though he governed his people by the ministry and agency of men: but now God himself will ascend the throne in a conspicuous manner, so that no one may doubt but that he is the king of his people.&#8221; And this 				was really and actually fulfilled in the person of Christ. Though Christ was indeed the true seed of David, he was yet at the same time Jehovah, even God manifested in the flesh. We hence see, that the Prophet here in lofty terms extols the glory of Christ&#8217;s kingdom; as though he had said that it would not be a shadowy kingdom as it was under the Law. <i>Jehovah then shall reign over you.</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.ix-p18"></A>He then subjoins, <i>on mount Zion</i>. We know that the seat of the kingdom of Christ has not been continued on mount Zion; but this verse must be connected with the beginning of this chapter. The Prophet has previously said, From Zion shall go forth a law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem. If then the interpretation of this place 				be asked, that is, how Jehovah showed himself the king of his people, and erected his throne on mount Zion, the answer is, that from thence the law went forth from that place, as from a fountain flowed the doctrine of salvation, to replenish the whole world. As then the Gospel, which God caused to be promulgated through the whole world, had its beginning on mount Zion, so the Prophet says that God would reign there. But we must at the same time observe, that through the defection and perfidy of 				the people it has happened that mount Zion is now only an insignificant corner of the earth, and not the most eminent in the world, as also the city Jerusalem, according to the prediction of Zechariah. Mount Zion then is now different from what it was formerly; for wherever the doctrine of the Gospel is preached, there is God really worshipped, there sacrifices are offered; in a word, there the spiritual temple exists. But yet the commencement of the Gospel must be taken to the account, if we 				would understand the real meaning of the Prophet, that is, that Christ, or God in the person of Christ, began to reign on mount Zion, when the doctrine of the Gospel from thence went forth to the extremities of the world. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iv.4.x"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption26"><a name="iv.4.x-p1"></A><a name="iv.4.x-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008">Micah 4:8</a><a name="iv.4.x-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.4.x-p2"></A><b>8.</b> And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.4.x-p3"></A><b>8. </b>Et tu turris gregis, arx filiae Sion, ad te veniet; perveniet principatus primus, regnum filiae Jerusalem.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="iv.4.x-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.4.x-p5"></A><a name="iv.4.x-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.x-p6"></A>Micah still continues the same subject, &#8212; that the miserable calamities of the people, or even their ruin, will not prevent God to restore again his Church. <i>Thou tower of the flock,</i> he says, <i>the fortress of the daughter of Zion,</i> doubt not but that God will again restore to thee thy ancient kingdom and dignity from which thou seemest now to have entirely fallen. But interpreters take the tower of the flock in various senses. Some think that the devastation of the city Jerusalem is pointed out, because it became like a cottage, as it is said in Isaiah; and <a name="iv.4.x-p6.1"></A>&#1506;&#1508;&#1500;, <i>ophil, </i>they render &#8220;obscure,&#8221; for its root is to cover. But another explanation is simpler, &#8212; that the holy city is called the tower of the flock, because God had chosen it for himself, to gather his people thence; for we know that they had there their holy assemblies. <i>Thou, </i>then, <i>the tower of the flock, </i>and then, <i>the fortress of the daughter of Zion, to thee shall come the former kingdom</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">129</FONT></A>
 				 If, however, the former sense be more approved, I will not contend; that is, that Jerusalem is here called the tower of the flock on account of its devastation, as it was reduced as it were into a cottage. As to the main import of the passage, there is no ambiguity; for the Prophet here strengthens the minds of the godly: they were not to regard the length of time, nor to allow their thoughts, to be occupied with their present calamity, but to feel assured, that 				what God had promised was in his power, that he could, as it were, raise the dead, and thus restore the kingdom of David, which had been destroyed.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.x-p8"></A>Do then, he says, firmly hope. &#8212; Why? because <i>come to thee, come to thee shall the former kingdom</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">130</FONT></A>
 				 Here the breaking off of the sentence is to be noticed, when the Prophet speaks of the ancient kingdom and dignity. It is not indeed to be doubted, but that the people of God had become objects of mockery, and that hypocrites and heathens thought that what David had testified respecting the perpetuity of his kingdom was a mere delusion.</p>  			 
<p class="Center"><a name="iv.4.x-p12"></A>&#8216;Behold thy kingdom,&#8217; he said, &#8216;shall continue as long as the sun and the moon,&#8217; <br> 				(<a name="iv.4.x-p12.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#000">Psalm 72</a><a name="iv.4.x-p12.2"></A>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.x-p13"></A>but soon after the death of Solomon, a small portion only was reserved for his posterity, and at length the kingdom itself and its dignity disappeared. This is the reason that the Prophet now says, that the former kingdom would come. <i>Come, </i>he says, <i>to thee, daughter of Zion, come shall the former kingdom</i>  There is indeed no doubt, but that by the former kingdom he understands its most flourishing condition, recorded in Scripture, under David and Solomon.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.x-p14"></A><i>The kingdom,</i> he says, <i>to the daughter of Jerusalem shall come</i>  He expressly mentions the daughter of Jerusalem, because the kingdom of Israel had obscured the glory of the true kingdom. Hence the Prophet testifies here 				that God was not unmindful of his promise, and that he would restore to Jerusalem the dignity which it had lost, and unite the whole people into one body, that they might be no more divided, but that one king would rule over the whole race of Abraham. But this was not fulfilled, we are certain, at the coming of Christ, in a manner visible to men: we must therefore bear in mind what Micah has previously taught, &#8212; that this kingdom is spiritual; for he did not ascribe to Christ a golden scepter, 				but a doctrine, &#8220;Come, and let us ascend unto the mount of Jehovah, and he will teach us of his ways; and then he added,&#8221; From Zion shall go forth a law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem. This, then, ought ever to be remembered, &#8212; that God has not rendered Jerusalem glorious in the sight of men, as it was formerly, nor has he enriched it with influence and wealth and earthly power; but he has yet restored the sovereign authority; for he has not only subjected to himself the ten tribes 				which had formerly revolted, but also the whole world. Let us go on &#8212;</p>  <a name="iv.4.xi"></A>

<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.4.xi-p8"></A><a name="iv.4.xi-p8.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.xi-p9"></A>The Prophet blends here things in their nature wholly contrary, &#8212; that the Jews were for a time to be cut off, &#8212; and that afterwards they were to recover their former state. Why, he says, <i>dost thou cry out with crying?</i> We must notice the Prophet&#8217;s design. He did not intend to overturn what he had before stated; but as the minds of 				the godly might have fainted amidst so many changes, the Prophet here gives them support, that they might continue firm in their faith; and hence he says, <i>Why dost thou cry aloud with loud crying?</i> That is, &#8220;I see that grievous troubles will arise capable of shaking even the stoutest hearts: time will be changeable; it will often be, that the faithful will be disturbed and 				degraded; but though various tumults may arise, and tempests throw all things into confusion, yet God will redeem his people.&#8221; We now then see what the Prophet means by saying, Why dost thou now cry? Why dost thou make an uproar? for the verb here properly means, not only to cry out, but also to sound the trumpet; as though he said, Why do the Jews so much torment themselves? There is he says, no doubt, a good reason.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.xi-p10"></A>And he adds, <i>Is there no king among thee?</i> This was doubtless the reason why the Jews so much harassed themselves; it was, because God had deprived them of their kingdom and of counsel: and we know what Jeremiah has said, &#8216;Christ,&#8217; that is, the anointed of the Lord, &#8216;by whose life we breathe, is slain,&#8217; 				(<a name="iv.4.xi-p10.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020">La 4:20</a><a name="iv.4.xi-p10.1"></A>.) Since, then, the whole Church derived as it were its life from the safety of its king, the faithful could not be otherwise than filled with amazement when the kingdom was upset and abolished; for the hope of salvation was taken away <i> Is there,</i> then, <i>not a king among thee? and have thy counselors perished?</i> Some think that the unfaithfulness of the people is here indirectly reproved, because they thought themselves to be destitute of the help of God and of his Christ, as though he said, &#8212; &#8220;Have ye forgotten what God has promised to you, that he would be your 				king for ever, and would send the Messiah to rule over you? nay, has he not promised that the kingdom of David would be perpetual? Whence then, is this fear and trembling, as though God no longer reigned in the midst of you, and the throne of David were hopelessly overturned?&#8221; These interpreters, in confirmation of this opinion, say, that Christ is here distinguished by the same title as in <a name="iv.4.xi-p10.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007">Isa 9:7</a><a name="iv.4.xi-p10.2"></A>; where he is called <a name="iv.4.xi-p10.3"></A>&#1497;&#1493;&#1506;&#1507;, <i>ivots</i>, a counselor. But as in this verse, it is the Prophet&#8217;s design to terrify, and to reprove rather than to alleviate the grievousness of evils by consolation; it is more probable, that their own destitution is set before the people; as though Micah said, &#8220;What cause have you for trembling? Is it 				because your king and all his counselors have been taken away?&#8221; But what immediately follows proves that this sorrow arose from a just cause; it was because they were stripped of all those things which had been till that time the evidences of God&#8217;s favor.</p>

 				 that is, I will not prevent thee to grieve and to mourn; as though he said, &#8220;Certainly even the strongest cannot look on calamities so dreadful, without suffering the heaviest sorrow; but though God may for a time subject his children to the greatest tortures, and expose them to the most grievous evils, he will yet restore them at length from their exile.&#8221; <i>Thou shalt depart</i>, he says, <i>from the city, and dwell in the field: thou shalt come even to Babylon; but there thou shalt be delivered; there shall Jehovah redeem thee from the hand of thy enemies</i>  The import of the whole is, that though God would have a care for his people, as he had promised, there was yet no cause for the faithful to flatter themselves, as though they were to be 				exempt from troubles; but the Prophet, on the contrary, exhorts them to prepare themselves to undergo calamities, as they were not only to be ejected from their country, and to wander in strange lands like vagrants, but were to be led away into Babylon as to their grave.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.xi-p14"></A>But to strengthen the minds of the faithful to bear the cross, he gives them a hope of deliverance, and says, that God would <i>there deliver</i> them, and <i>there redeem</i> them from the hand of their enemies. He repeats the adverb, <a name="iv.4.xi-p14.1"></A>&#1513;&#1501;, <i>shem</i>, there, twice, and not without cause: for the faithful might have excluded every hope of deliverance, as though the gate of God&#8217;s power had been closed. And this is the reason why the Prophet repeats twice<i>, there, there;</i> even from the grave he will deliver and redeem thee: &#8220;Extend then your hope, 				not only to a small measure of favor, as though God could deliver you only from a state of some small danger, but even to death itself. Though then ye lay, as it were, in your graves, yet doubt not but that God will stretch forth his hand to you, for he will be your deliverer. God then in whose power is victory, can overcome many and innumerable deaths.&#8221;</p>  <a name="iv.4.xii"></A>

<p><a name="iv.4.xiv-p11"></A><i>Assemble, </i>he says, <i>against thee do nations,</i> or strong nations: for, by saying, <a name="iv.4.xiv-p11.1"></A>&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, <i>guim rebim</i>, he intimates one of two things, either that they were strong, or that they were large in number: as to the subject there is no great difference. The Prophet had this in view, &#8212; that though the Church of God may be pressed by a great multitude of enemies, it yet ought not to be broken down in mind: for the ungodly, while they cruelly domineer, do not understand the design of God. <i>Assemble,</i> then, <i>against thee do many nations</i>  He sets the thing before them, to heal them of terror: for when we are beyond the reach of harm, we, for the most part, too heedlessly despise all dangers; and then, when we come to a real struggle, we tremble, or even fall and become wholly weak. This is the 				reason why the Prophet sets before the Jews their prospects, and shows that the time was near when they were to endure a siege, as enemies would, on all sides, surround them. Assemble then do nations, and strong or many nations: he shows here that the Jews had no reason to despond, though their enemies would far exceed them in number, and in forces, and in courage, for it was enough for them to be under the protection of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.xiv-p12"></A><i>Who say, condemned now shall be Zion</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">133</FONT></A>
 				 The verb <a name="iv.4.xiv-p17.1"></A>&#1495;&#1504;&#1507;, <i>chenaph, </i>means to act wickedly and perversely. It may then be literally rendered, &#8216;profane (scelerata) shall be Zion; and on it shall our eye look:&#8217; but this word is often taken metaphorically for condemnation. The meaning then is, &#8216;Zion is now condemned:&#8217; and the Prophet, no doubt, intended to 				intimate here, that the enemies would so triumph, as though Zion were not under the guardianship of God; as when any one, who has rendered himself hateful by his vices, is left and forsaken by his patrons. So, then, the Prophet here arms the faithful against the arrogance of their enemies, that they might not despair, when they found that they were condemned by the consent of all men, and that this was the opinion of all, &#8212; that they were forsaken by God.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.4.xiv-p18"></A><a name="iv.4.xiv-p18.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.xiv-p19"></A>Consolation follows, <i>But they know not the thoughts of Jehovah, nor understand his counsel</i>: for verbs in the past tense have the meaning of the present. Here the Prophet recalls the attention of the godly to a subject the most suitable to them: for when the wicked rise up so cruelly against us, we are apt to think that all things 				are allowed to them, and then their reproaches and slanders immediately take possession of our minds and thoughts, so that we in a manner measure God&#8217;s judgment by their words. Hence when the ungodly deride our faith, and boast that we are forsaken by God, we succumb, being as it were filled with amazement: and nothing is easier than to shake off from us faith and the memory of God&#8217;s promises, whenever the ungodly are thus insolent. The Prophet then does not without cause apply a remedy which 				ought to be carefully observed by us. <i>Who say, condemned is Zion;</i> but they are like the blind when judging of colors, <i>for they understand not the counsel of Jehovah and his thoughts they know not.</i> We now then see what the Prophet had in view, which was to show, &#8212; 				that the faithful would be unwise and foolish, if they formed an opinion of God&#8217;s judgment according to the boasting of the ungodly: for Satan carries them away in a furious manner; and when the Lord gives them liberty to do evil, they think that they shall be conquerors to the end. As then the ungodly are thus inebriated with foolish confidence, and despise not only men, but God himself, the Prophet here holds up and supports the minds of the godly that they might ascend higher, and thus 				understand that the design of God was not the same as what the wicked thought, who neither belonged to nor approached God.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">134</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.xiv-p23"></A>It is especially needful to know this truth. Some at the first sight may think it frigid, &#8220;O! than, what does the Prophet mean? he says that what these declare is not the design of Jehovah; and this we know.&#8221; But were all to examine the subject, they would then confess with one mouth, that nothing could have been more seasonable than this consolation. Now we are wounded by reproaches, and this very often happens to ingenuous men; and 				then, while the ungodly vomit forth their slanders, we think that God rests indifferently in heaven; and one of their words, like a cloud, obscures the judgment of God. As soon as any one of the wicked derides us, and laughs at our simplicity, threatens ferociously, and spreads forth his terrors, his words, as I have said, are like a cloud intervening between us and God. This is the reason why the Prophet says here, that the thoughts of Jehovah are different, and that his counsel is different: 				in short, the Prophet&#8217;s object is to show, that whenever the ungodly thus proudly despise us, and also reproachfully threaten and terrify us, we ought to raise our thoughts to heaven. &#8212; Why so? Because the design of God is another. Their boastings then will vanish, for they arise from nothing, and they shall come to nothing, but the purpose of God shall stand.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.xiv-p24"></A>But let us now see why the Prophet spoke here of the design and thoughts of God: for if only these two words are brought before us, there is certainly but little solid comfort, and nothing that has much force or power. There is then another principle to be understood, &#8212; that the thoughts of God are known to us, who are taught in his school. The counsel of God then is not hidden, for it is revealed to us in his Word. Consolation therefore 				depends on a higher and a more recondite doctrine; that is, that the faithful, in their miseries, ought to contemplate the counsel of God as in a mirror. And what is this? that when he afflicts us, he holds a remedy in his hand, and that when he throws us into the grave, he can restore us to life and safety. When, therefore, we understand this design of God, &#8212; that he chastens his Church with temporal evils, and that the issue will ever be most salutary, &#8212; when this is known by us, there is 				then no reason why the slanders of the ungodly should deject our minds; and when they vomit forth all their reproaches, we ought to adhere firmly to this counsel of God. But that the ungodly are thus proud is no matter of wonder; for if they raise their horns against God, why should they not despise us also, who are so few in number, and of hardly any influence, at least not equal to what they possess? The Church is indeed contemptible in the eyes of the world; and it is no wonder if our 				enemies thus deride us, and load us with ridicule and contempt, when they dare to act so frowardly towards God. But it is enough for us to know, that they do not understand the counsel of God. We now then see the Prophet&#8217;s meaning, and an explanation follows, &#8212;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.xiv-p25"></A><i>For thou shalt assemble them,</i> he says, <i>as a sheaf</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">135</FONT></A>
 				 <i>to the floor</i>  The Prophet adds this clause as an explanation, that we may know what the counsel of God is, which he has mentioned, and that is, that God will collect the enemies as a sheaf. What is a sheaf? It is a small quantity of corn, it may be three hundred or a thousand ears of corn: they are ears of corn, and carried in a man&#8217;s hand. And 				then, what is to be done with the sheaf? It is to be thrashed on the floor. It was indeed difficult to believe, that enemies, when thus collected together on every side, would be like a sheaf. If an army assembled against us, not only ten or twenty thousand, but a much larger number, who would think, according to the judgment of the flesh, that they would be like a sheaf? They shall be as so many deaths and graves: even the thought of God ought to be to us of more account than the formidable 				power of men. Whenever, therefore, our enemies exceed us in strength and number, let us learn to arise to that secret counsel of God, of which our Prophet now speaks; and then it will be easy for us to regard a vast multitude to be no more than a handful. And he says, that our enemies are to be gathered to a floor, that they may be thrashed there. They assemble themselves for another purpose; for they think that we shall be presently in their power, that they may swallow us up; but when they 				thus collect themselves and their forces, the Lord will frustrate their purpose and cause them to be thrashed by us. It follows, &#8212;</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.4.xiv-p27"></A><a name="iv.4.xiv-p27.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.xiv-p28"></A><i>Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion; for I have made thy horn </i>  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">136</FONT></A>
 				<i> iron, and thy hoofs brass.</i> The Prophet here confirms what he had previously said: and he exhorts the daughter of Zion to arise; for it was necessary for her to have been cast down, so as to lie prostrate on the ground. God did not indeed restore at once his Church, but afflicted her for a time, so that she differed nothing from a dead man. As then a dead body lies on the ground without any 				feeling, so also did the Church of God lie prostrate. This is the reason why the Prophet now says, <i>Arise, daughter of Zion;</i> as though God, by his voice, roused the dead. We hence see, that the word <a name="iv.4.xiv-p29.2"></A>&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;, <i>kumi,</i> is 				emphatical; for the Prophet reminds us, that there is no reason for the faithful wholly to despair, when they find themselves thus cast down, for their restoration is in the hand and power of God, as it is the peculiar office of God to raise the dead. And this same truth ought to be applied for our us, whenever we are so cast down, that no strength, no vigor, remains in us. How then can we rise again? By the power of God, who by his voice alone can restore us to life, which seemed to be wholly 				extinct.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.xiv-p30"></A>He afterwards subjoins, <i>Thresh, for I have made thy horn iron, and thy hoofs brass.</i> A mode of thrashing, we know, was in use among the Jews the same with that in Italy and at this day in French Provence. We here thrash the corn with flails; but there by treading. The Prophet speaks here of this custom, 				and compares the Church of God to oxen; as though he said &#8220;The Jews shall be like oxen with iron horns and brazen hoofs that they may lay prostrate under them the whole strength of the nations. However much then the nations may now excel, I will subject them under the feet of my people, as if sheaves were thrashed by them.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.xiv-p31"></A>He then adds,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">137</FONT></A>
 				 <i>And thou shalt separate or consecrate their wealth to Jehovah, and their substance</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">138</FONT></A>
 				 <i>to the Lord of the whole earth</i>  Here the Prophet specifies the end for which God had purposed to subject the heathen nations to his chosen people, &#8212; that he might be glorified. This is the meaning. But they have refined too much in allegories, who have thought that this prophecy ought to be confined to the time of Christ: for the Prophet no doubt 				meant to extend consolation to the whole kingdom of Christ, from the beginning to the end. Others, not more correctly, say, that this is to be referred to the Babylonian captivity because then Daniel and some others thrashed the people, when heathen kings were induced through their teaching to restore the temple, and also to offer some worship to the God of Israel. But on this point they are both mistaken, because they take the word thrashing in a different sense from the Prophet; for it 				commonly means that heathen nations are to be subjected to the Church of God: and this takes place, whenever God stretches forth his hand to the faithful, and suffers not the ungodly to exercise their cruelty as they wish; yea, when he makes them humbly to supplicate the faithful. This often happens in the world, as it is written of Christ, &#8216;thy enemies shall lick the earth,&#8217; (<a name="iv.4.xiv-p34.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009">Ps 72:9</a><a name="iv.4.xiv-p34.1"></A>.) But this prophecy shall not be fulfilled until the last coming of Christ. We indeed begin to tread on our enemies whenever God by his power destroys them, or at least causes them to tremble and to be cast down, as we find that they dread whenever any change takes place; and then they blandly profess that they desire to serve God. So at this day it has happened both in France and in Italy. How many hypocrites, for the sake of an earthly advantage, have submitted themselves to God? 				and how many such England produced when the Gospel flourished there? All the courtiers, and others who were unwilling to incur the displeasure of the king, professed themselves to be the very best lovers of religion. (<i>optimos pietatis cultores,</i> &#8212; the best observers of piety) But yet this is ever the case,</p>  			 
<p class="Center"><a name="iv.4.xiv-p35"></A>&#8216;Aliens have been false to thee,&#8217; (<a name="iv.4.xiv-p35.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#044">Ps 18:44</a><a name="iv.4.xiv-p35.1"></A>.)</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.xiv-p36"></A>We hence see what the prophet means when he speaks of thrashing: he intimates, that the Lord would often cause that the enemies of the Church should be bruised, though no one crushed them: but, as I have said, we must look forward to the last day, if we wish to see the complete fulfillment of this prophecy.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.4.xiv-p37"></A>He afterwards adds, <i>Thou shalt consecrate their wealth to Jehovah, and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth</i>  The Prophet shows here, that the dominion is not to be hoped for by the children of God, that they may abound in worldly pleasures, and appropriate every thing to themselves and also 				abuse their power, as ungodly men are wont to do; but that all is to be applied to the worship and the glory of God. For what purpose, then does God design his Church to become eminent? That he himself may alone shine forth, and that the faithful may rightly enjoy their honor, and not become thereby proud. There is, therefore nothing more alien to the power of the Church than pride, or cruelty, or avarice. This, then that is said ought to be carefully observed, <i>their wealth thou shalt consecrate to Jehovah</i>  He had spoken before of power, &#8220;Thou shalt bind strong people, thou shalt thrash them, and thou shalt tread them under thy feet;&#8221; but lest the faithful should turn all this to a purpose the Lord had not designed, a most suitable correction is immediately added, and that is, that this power shall not be exercised according to the will of men, but 				according to the will of God: Thou shalt then consecrate, etc.; and he uses the word <a name="iv.4.xiv-p37.1"></A>&#1495;&#1512;&#1501;, <i>cherem</i>, which means to make a thing an anathema or an offering;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">139</FONT></A>
 				 as though he said &#8220;God will raise his Church that it may rule over its enemies; but let the faithful at the same time take heed, that they rule not tyrannically; for God designs ever to reign alone: therefore the whole excellency, the whole dignity, the whole power of the Church ought to be applied for this end, &#8212; that all things may become subject to God, and every thing among the nations may be altogether sacred to him so that the worship of God may flourish 				among the conquerors, as well as among the conquered.&#8221; We now perceive the Prophet&#8217;s object in speaking of consecrating the wealth of the nations. Now follows &#8212;</p>

The answer is here given, &#8220;for go forth shall a law from Zion,&#8221; etc. And this 					 was literally fulfilled at the commencement of the Gospel; it was first preached at Jerusalem: in consequence of this, the mount of Jehovah&#8217;s house, or the Church, was formed; and what is here predicted was in part fulfilled, and will no doubt be hereafter more completely fulfilled.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iv.4.i-p31"></A>It is said, &#8220;on top of the mountains,&#8221; not of a mountain. The Church was not to be confined to one place, but was to be preeminent throughout the earth. It was to be coextensive with the word that was to go forth from Zion. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.4.iii-p11"></A> So <i>Newcome</i> renders it; <i>Lowth</i> and <i>Henderson</i> read the same with our version, &#8220;the law.&#8221; The absence of the definite article is certainly no objection, as it is but seldom used in Hebrew. But &#8220;a law&#8221; is better except we render the copulative before &#8220;word,&#8221; even; and then we shall destroy the distinct character of the line. It appears that, according to the usual style of the Prophets, what the first line states indefinitely, 					 is in the second specified, as being the &#8220;word of Jehovah.&#8221;</p>  				  
<p><a name="iv.4.iii-p12"></A>The word <a name="iv.4.iii-p12.1"></A>&#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, law, in Hebrew, is more comprehensive than the word law, in our language. It is derived from the Hiphil of <a name="iv.4.iii-p12.2"></A>&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, which means to direct, to appoint, to instruct, to teach. Hence the noun, 					 <a name="iv.4.iii-p12.3"></A>&#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, may be rendered, directory, institution, law, teaching, or doctrine. &#8220;It doth,&#8221; says <i>Leigh</i>, &#8220;not only signify strictly what is to be done, but it denoteth largely any heavenly doctrine, whether it be promise or precept.&#8221; It means often the whole of God&#8217;s revealed word, as in <a name="iv.4.iii-p12.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002">Ps 1:2</a><a name="iv.4.iii-p12.4"></A>; <a name="iv.4.iii-p12.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#174">Ps 119:174</a><a name="iv.4.iii-p12.5"></A>, etc. See <a name="iv.4.iii-p12.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#008">Jos 1:8</a><a name="iv.4.iii-p12.6"></A>. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.4.iv-p8"></A> There is a difference of opinion as to the nominative case to the verb &#8220;judge;&#8221; whether it be Jehovah in the preceding line, or the word of Jehovah. The most natural construction is the last supposition. <i>Jerome</i> and <i>Cyril,</i> as quoted by <i>Marckius,</i> refer it to the word of Jehovah, taking the word for Christ: but this cannot be admitted, as the law and the word seem to mean the same thing, and must be considered as the word of 					 the Gospel; and <i>Justin Martyr</i> and <i>Irenaeus,</i> when referring to this passage regard it as such. And this is the view which <i>Marckius</i> seems to prefer. The rendering then would be, &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent01"><a name="iv.4.iv-p9"></A>And it shall judge among many people, <br> 					 And convince strong nations afar off.</p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.4.iv-p11"></A> The two verbs here used are <a name="iv.4.iv-p11.1"></A>&#1513;&#1508;&#1496;, to judge, and <a name="iv.4.iv-p11.2"></A>&#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495;, in Hiphil, to reprove. The first is to decide what is right and wrong, and also to defend the right and to punish the wrong; hence it means to arbitrate, and 					 also to vindicate as well as to punish. The first sense is most suitable to this place. &#8212; The other verb does not occur in Kal, but in Hiphil, it means to make manifest, or show, by facts or by words, or by action; and hence it signifies to demonstrate, to convince, to reprove, to chastise. The Septuagint often renders it by <a name="iv.4.iv-p11.3"></A>&#949;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;, which, Parkhurst says, means, in its primary sense, to 					 demonstrate by convincing reasons or arguments. <i>Lowth&#8217;s</i> version in Isaiah is, &#8220;And shall work conviction,&#8221; etc. <i>Newcome</i> renders it &#8220;convince.&#8221; The rendering of <i>Henderson,</i> &#8220;give decision,&#8221; is not to be approved. See <a name="iv.4.iv-p11.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008">Joh 16:8</a><a name="iv.4.iv-p11.4"></A>. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.4.iv-p19"></A> &#8220;All these predictions must be confined to the nations converted by the word of Jehovah, and brought into Zion, that is, such as truly repent and believe, and must not be extended to all nations indiscriminately, or to all who embrace the Christian name, who are often as far as possible from the kingdom of Christ, inasmuch as they neither learn nor follow his doctrine. &#8212; <i>Marckius.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.4.viii-p9"></A> <i>Marckius</i> views this passage differently. He considers that the converted Gentiles are meant here, &#8212; that when turned from their idols and their superstitions, they shall profess the true God, as revealed in the Gospel, and that each nation will regard him as its own God: however various in outward circumstances, they shall yet acknowledge the God revealed in his Word as their own. This view most certainly harmonizes better with the 					 context than that of <i>Calvin,</i> which is commonly adopted. There is another, which is the same nearly in meaning, but founded on a different rendering of the words. The Jewish commentator <i>Abarbanel,</i> as quoted by <i>Marckius,</i> gives this version: &#8212;</p>  				  
<p><a name="iv.4.viii-p10"></A>&#8220;<a name="iv.4.viii-p10.1"></A>Nam omnes populi, qui ambulabant quisque in nomine dei sui, et now ambulabimus in nomine Jehovae Dei nostri.&#8221;</p>  				  
<p><a name="iv.4.viii-p11"></A>The words will no doubt admit of this construction; for it is often the case in Hebrew, that <a name="iv.4.viii-p11.1"></A>&#1488;&#1513;&#1512;, who, is understood before a verb in the future tense, especially when it has the meaning of the present, as here, for the preceding &#8220;<a name="iv.4.viii-p11.2"></A>ambulabant,&#8221; might be rendered &#8220;<a name="iv.4.viii-p11.3"></A>ambulant,&#8221; without any inconstancy in the meaning. I would therefore render the verse thus, &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent04"><a name="iv.4.viii-p12"></A><i>For all the nations, <br> 					 </i>Who <i>walk each in the name of its god, <br> 					 And we ourselves, <br> 					 Shall walk in the name of Jehovah our God, <br> 					 For ever and ever.</i></p>  				  
<p><a name="iv.4.viii-p13"></A>The nations were then walking in the name of their multiplied gods; but at the time alluded to, both Gentiles and Jews would walk together in the name of Jehovah. There is thus an entire correspondence between all the parts of this remarkable passage, which extends from the first verse to the seventh inclusive; a part of which, extending only to the end of the third verse, is to be found in Isaiah. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

Here <a name="iv.4.viii-p15.3"></A>&#1506;&#1491; is added to show that these ages would be endless, or to the end of time: for <a name="iv.4.viii-p15.4"></A>&#1506;&#1491; is &#8220;still,&#8221; unceasing futurity, that which is perpetual, still 					 the same.
