<p><a name="xii.i-p12"></A><b>1.</b> <i>There is then,</i> <i>etc.</i> After having described the contest which the godly have perpetually with their own flesh, he returns to the consolation, which was very needful for them, and which he had before mentioned; and it was this, &#8212; That 			 though they were still beset by sin, they were yet exempt fiom the power of death, and from every curse, provided they lived not in the flesh but in the Spirit: for he joins together these three things, &#8212; the imperfection under which the faithful always labor, &#8212; the mercy of God in pardoning and forgiving it, &#8212;and the regeneration of the Spirit; and this indeed in the last place, that no one should flatter himself with a vain notion, as though he were freed from the curse, while securely 			 indulging in the meantime his own flesh. As then the carnal man flatters himself in vain, when in no way solicitous to reform his life, he promises to himself impunity under the pretense of having this grace; so the trembling consciences of the godly have an invincible fortress, for they know that while they abide in Christ they are beyond every danger of condemnation. We shall now examine the words.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p13"></A><i>After the Spirit.</i> Those who walk after the Spirit are not such as have wholly put off all the emotions of the flesh, so that their whole life is redolent with nothing but celestial perfection; but they are those who sedulously labor to subdue and mortify the flesh, so that the love of true religion seems to reign in them. He declares that such walk not after the 			 flesh; for wherever the real fear of God is vigorous, it takes away from the flesh its sovereignty, though it does not abolish all its corruptions.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p14"></A><a name="xii.i-p14.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p15"></A><b>2.</b> <i>For the law of the Spirit of life,</i> <i>etc.</i> This is a confirmation of the former sentence; and that it may be understood, the meaning of the words must be noticed. Using a language not strictly correct, by the<i> law of the Spirit</i> he designates the Spirit of God, who sprinkles our souls with the blood of Christ, not only to cleanse us from the stain of sin with respect to its guilt, but also to sanctify us that we may be really purified. He adds that it is life-giving, (for the genitive case, after the manner of the Hebrew, is to be taken as an adjective,) it hence follows, that they who detain man in the letter of the law, expose him to death. On the other hand, he gives the name of the <i>law of sin</i> and <i>death</i> to the dominion of the flesh and to the tyranny of death, which thence follows: the law of God is set as it were in the middle, which by teaching righteousness cannot confer it, but on the contrary binds us with the strongest chains in bondage to sin and to death.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p16"></A>The meaning then is, &#8212; that the law of God condemns men, and that this happens, because as long as they remain under the bond of the law, they are oppressed with the bondage of sin, and are thus exposed to death; but that the Spirit of Christ, while it abolishes the law of sin in us by destroying the prevailing desires of the flesh, does at the same time deliver us from the peril of death. If any one objects and says, that then pardon, by 			 which our transgressions are buried, depends on regeneration; to this it may be easily answered, that the reason is not here assigned by Paul, but that the manner only is specified, in which we are delivered from guilt; and Paul denies that we obtain deliverance by the external teaching of the law, but intimates that when we are renewed by the Spirit of God, we are at the same time justified by a gratuitous pardon, that the curse of sin may no longer abide on us. The sentence then has the same 			 meaning, as though Paul had said, that the grace of regeneration is never disjoined from the imputation of righteousness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p17"></A>I dare not, with some, take <i>the law of sin and death</i> for the law of God, because it seems a harsh expression. For though by increasing sin it generates death, yet Paul before turned aside designedly from this invidious language. At the same time I no more agree in opinion with those who explain the law of sin as being the lust of the 			 flesh, as though Paul had said, that he had become the conqueror of it. But it will appear very evident shortly, as I think, that he speaks of a gratuitous absolution, which brings to us tranquillizing peace with God. I prefer retaining the word <i>law</i>, rather than with <a name="xii.i-p17.1"></A>Erasmus to render it <i>right</i> or <i>power:</i> for Paul did not without reason allude to the law of God.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">238</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p19"></A><a name="xii.i-p19.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p20"></A><b>3.</b> <i>For what was impossible for the law</i>, <i>etc.</i> Now follows the polishing or the adorning of his proof, that the Lord has by his gratuitous mercy justified us in Christ; the very thing which it was impossible for the law to do. But as this is a very remarkable 			 sentence, let us examine every part of it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p21"></A>That he treats here of free justification or of the pardon by which God reconciles us to himself, we may infer from the last clause, when he adds, <i>who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit</i>  For if Paul intended to teach us, that we are prepared by the spirit of regeneration to overcome sin, 			 why was this addition made? But it was very proper for him, after having promised gratuitous remission to the faithful, to confine this doctrine to those who join penitence to faith, and turn not the mercy of God so as to promote the licentiousness of the flesh. And then the state of the case must be noticed; for the Apostle teaches us here how the grace of Christ absolves us from guilt.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p22"></A>Now as to the expression, <a name="xii.i-p22.1"></A>&#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#948;&#8059;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957;, the impossibility of the law, it is no doubt to be taken for defect or impotency; as though it had been said, that a remedy had been found by God, by which that which was an impossibility to the law is removed. The particle, <a name="xii.i-p22.2"></A>&#7952;&#957; 			 &#8103;, <a name="xii.i-p22.3"></A>Erasmus has rendered &#8220;<a name="xii.i-p22.4"></A>ea parte qua &#8212; in that part in which;&#8221; but as I think it to be causal, I prefer rendering it, &#8220;<a name="xii.i-p22.5"></A>eo quod &#8212; because:&#8221; and though perhaps such a phrase 			 does not occur among good authors in the Greek language, yet as the Apostles everywhere adopt Hebrew modes of expression, this interpretation ought not to be deemed improper.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_238"><FONT SIZE="1">239</FONT></A>
 			  No doubt intelligent readers will allow, that the cause of defect is what is here expressed, as we shall shortly prove again. Now though <a name="xii.i-p23.11"></A>Erasmus supplies the principal verb, yet the text seems to me to flow better without it. The copulative <a name="xii.i-p23.12"></A>&#954;&#945;&#8054;, <i>and</i>, has led <a name="xii.i-p23.13"></A>Erasmus astray, so as to insert the verb <a name="xii.i-p23.14"></A><i>pr&#339;stitit</i> &#8212; hath performed; but I think that it is used for the sake of emphasis; except it may be, that some will approve of the conjecture of a Grecian scholiast, who connects the clause thus with the preceding words, 			 &#8220;God sent his own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and on account of sin,&#8221; etc. I have however followed what I have thought to be the real meaning of Paul. I come now to the subject itself.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_239"><FONT SIZE="1">240</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p27"></A>Paul clearly declares that our sins were expiated by the death of Christ, because it was impossible for the law to confer righteousness upon us. It hence follows, that more is required by the law than what we can perform; for if we were capable of fulfilling the law there would have been no need to seek a remedy elsewhere. It is therefore absurd to measure human strength by the precepts of the law; as though God in requiring what is justly 			 due, had regarded what and how much we are able to do.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p28"></A><i>Because it was weak</i> <i>etc.</i> That no one might think that the law was irreverently charged with weakness, or confine it to ceremonies, Paul has distinctly expressed that this defect was not owing to any fault in the law, but to the corruption of our flesh; for it must be allowed that if any one really satisfies the 			 divine law, he will be deemed just before God. He does not then deny that the law is sufficient to justify us as to doctrine, inasmuch as it contains a perfect rule of righteousness: but as our flesh does not attain that righteousness, the whole power of the law fails and vanishes away. Thus condemned is the error or rather the delirious notion of those who imagine that the power of justifying is only taken away from ceremonies; for Paul, by laying the blame expressly on us, clearly shows that 			 he found no fault with the doctrine of the law.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p29"></A>But further, understand the weakness of the law according to the sense in which the Apostle usually takes the word <a name="xii.i-p29.1"></A>&#945;&#963;&#952;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#945;, weakness, not only as meaning a small imbecility but impotency; for he means that the law has no power whatever to justify.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_240"></A><A HREF="#fn_240"><FONT SIZE="1">241</FONT></A>
 			  You then see that we are wholly excluded from the righteousness of works, and must therefore flee to Christ for righteousness, for in us there can be none, and to know this is especially necessary; for we shall never be clothed with the righteousness of Christ except we first know assuredly that we have no righteousness of our own. The word <i>flesh 			 </i>is to be taken still in the same sense, as meaning ourselves. The corruption then of our nature renders the law of God in this respect useless to us; for while it shows the way of life, it does not bring us back who are running headlong into death.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p31"></A><i>God having sent his own Son,</i> <i>etc.</i> He now points out the way in which our heavenly Father has restored righteousness to us by his Son, even by condemning sin in the very flesh of Christ; who by cancelling as it were the handwriting, abolished sin, which held us bound before God; for the condemnation of sin made us 			 free and brought us righteousness, for sin being blotted out we are absolved, so that God counts us as just. But he declares first that Christ was <i>sent</i>, in order to remind us that righteousness by no means dwells in us, for it is to be sought from him, and that men in vain confide in their own merits, who become not just but at the pleasure of another, or who borrow righteousness from that expiation which Christ accomplished in his own flesh. 			 But he says, that he came in<i> the likeness of the flesh of sin; </i>for though the flesh of Christ was polluted by no stains, yet it seemed apparently to be sinful, inasmuch as it sustained the punishment due to our sins, and doubtless death exercised all its power over it as though it was subject to itself. And as it behoved our High-priest to learn by his own experience how to aid the 			 weak, Christ underwent our infirmities, that he might be more inclined to sympathy, and in this respect also there appeared some resemblance of a sinful nature.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p32"></A><i>Even for sin</i>, <i>etc.</i> I have already said that this is explained by some as the cause or the end for which God sent his own Son, that is, to give satisfaction for sin. <a name="xii.i-p32.1"></A>Chrysostom and many after him understood it in a still harsher sense, even that sin was 			 condemned for sin, and for this reason, because it assailed Christ unjustly and beyond what was right. I indeed allow that though he was just and innocent, he yet underwent punishment for sinners, and that the price of redemption was thus paid; but I cannot be brought to think that the word <i>sin</i> is put here in any other sense than that of an expiatory sacrifice, which is called <a name="xii.i-p32.2"></A>&#1488;&#1513;&#1501;, <i>ashem</i>, in Hebrew,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_241"></A><A HREF="#fn_241"><FONT SIZE="1">242</FONT></A>
 			  and so the Greeks call a sacrifice to which a curse is annexed <a name="xii.i-p36.5"></A>&#954;&#8049;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#945;, <i>catharma. </i>The same thing is declared by Paul in <a name="xii.i-p36.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021">2Co 5:21</a><a name="xii.i-p36.6"></A>, when he says, that</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xii.i-p37"></A>&#8220;Christ, who knew no sin, was made sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in him.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p38"></A>But the preposition <a name="xii.i-p38.1"></A>&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; <i>peri</i>, is to be taken here in a causative sense, as though he had said, &#8220;On account of that sacrifice, or through the burden of sin being laid on Christ, sin was cast down from its power, so that it does not hold us now subject to itself.&#8221; For using a 			 metaphor, he says that it was <i>condemned</i>, like those who fail in their cause; for God no longer deals with those as guilty who have obtained absolution through the sacrifice of Christ. If we say that the kingdom of sin, in which it held us, was demolished, the meaning would be the same. And thus what was ours Christ took as his own, that he might transfer his own to us; for he took our curse, and has freely 			 granted us his blessing.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p39"></A>Paul adds here, <i>In the flesh</i>, and for this end, &#8212; that by seeing sin conquered and abolished in our very nature, our confidence might be more certain: for it thus follows, that our nature is really become a partaker of his victory; and this is what he presently declares.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p40"></A><a name="xii.i-p40.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p41"></A><b>4.</b> <i>That the justification of the law might be fulfilled</i>, <i>etc.</i> They who understand that the renewed, by the Spirit of Christ, fulfil the law, introduce a gloss wholly alien to the meaning of Paul; for the faithful, while they sojourn in this world, never make such 			 a proficiency, as that the justification of the law becomes in them full or complete. This then must be applied to forgiveness; for when the obedience of Christ is accepted for us, the law is satisfied, so that we are counted just. For the perfection which the law demands was exhibited in our flesh, and for this reason &#8212; that its rigor should no longer have the power to condemn us. But as Christ communicates his righteousness to none but to those whom he joins to himself by the bond of his 			 Spirit, the work of renewal is again mentioned, lest Christ should be thought to be the minister of sin: for it is the inclination of many so to apply whatever is taught respecting the paternal kindness of God, as to encourage the lasciviousness of the flesh; and some malignantly slander this doctrine, as though it extinquished the desire to live uprightly.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_242"></A><A HREF="#fn_242"><FONT SIZE="1">243</FONT></A>

<p class="TableCaption19"><a name="xii.ii-p1"></A><a name="xii.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#005">Romans 8:5-8</a><a name="xii.ii-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xii.ii-p2"></A><b>5.</b> For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xii.ii-p3"></A><b>5.</b> Qui enim secundum carnem sunt, ea qu&aelig; carnis sunt cogitant; qui vero secundum Spiritum, ea qu&aelig; sunt Spiritus.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xii.ii-p4"></A><b>6.</b> For to be carnally minded <i>is</i> death; but to be spiritually minded <i>is</i> life and peace.</p>

<p><a name="xii.ii-p6"></A><b>7.</b> Because the carnal mind <i>is</i> enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</p>

<p><a name="xii.ii-p8"></A><b>8.</b> So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</p>

<p><a name="xii.ii-p10"></A><a name="xii.ii-p10.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p11"></A><b>5.</b> <i>For they who are after the flesh,</i> <i>etc.</i> He introduces this difference between the flesh and the Spirit, not only to confirm, by an argument derived from what is of an opposite character, what he has before mentioned, &#8212; that the grace of Christ belongs to none 			 but to those who, having been regenerated by the Spirit, strive after purity; but also to relieve the faithful with a seasonable consolation, lest being conscious of many infirmities, they should despair: for as he had exempted none from the curse, but those who lead a spiritual life, he might seem to cut off from all mortals the hope of salvation; for who in this world can be found adorned with so much angelic purity so as to be wholly freed from the flesh? It was therefore necessary to define 			 what it is to<i> be in the flesh</i>, and to <i>walk after the flesh</i>. At first, indeed, Paul does not define the distinction so very precisely; but yet we shall see as we proceed, that his object is to afford good hope to the faithful, though they are bound to their flesh; only let them not give loose reins to its lusts, but give themselves up to be guided by the Holy Spirit.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p12"></A>By saying that<i> carnal</i> men care for, or think upon, the things of the flesh, he shows that he did not count those as carnal who aspire after celestial righteousness, but those who wholly devote themselves to the world. I have rendered <a name="xii.ii-p12.1"></A>&#966;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957; by a word of 			 larger meaning, <a name="xii.ii-p12.2"></A><i>cogitant</i> &#8212; think, that readers may understand that those only are excluded from being the children of God who, being given to the allurements of the flesh, apply their minds and study to depraved lusts.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_243"></A><A HREF="#fn_243"><FONT SIZE="1">244</FONT></A>
 			  Now, in the second clause he encourages the faithful to entertain good hope, provided they find that they are raised up by the Spirit to the meditation of righteousness: for wherever the Spirit reigns, it is an evidence of the saving grace of God; as the grace of God does not exist where the Spirit being extinguished the reign of the flesh prevails. But I will briefly repeat here what I have reminded you of before, &#8212; That to be <i>in the flesh</i>, or, <i>after the flesh,</i> is the same thing as to be without the gift of regeneration:   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_244"></A><A HREF="#fn_244"><FONT SIZE="1">245</FONT></A>
 			  and such are all they who continue, as they commonly say, <a name="xii.ii-p15.2"></A>in pure naturals, (<a name="xii.ii-p15.3"></A><i>Puris naturalibus</i>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p16"></A><a name="xii.ii-p16.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p17"></A><b>6.</b> <i>The minding of the flesh</i>, <i>etc.</i> <a name="xii.ii-p17.1"></A>Erasmus has rendered it &#8220;affection,&#8221; (<a name="xii.ii-p17.2"></A><i>affectum</i><i>;</i>) the old translator, &#8220;prudence,&#8221; (<a name="xii.ii-p17.3"></A><i>prudentiam</i>.) But as it is certain that the <a name="xii.ii-p17.4"></A>&#964;&#959; &#966;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#956;&#945; of Paul is the same with what Moses calls the imagination (<a name="xii.ii-p17.5"></A><i>figmentum</i> &#8212; devising) of the heart, (<a name="xii.ii-p17.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005">Ge 6:5</a><a name="xii.ii-p17.6"></A>;) and that under this word are included all the faculties of the soul &#8212; reason, understanding, and affections, it seems to me that minding (<a name="xii.ii-p17.7"></A><i>cogitatio</i> &#8212; thinking, imagining, caring) is a 			 more suitable word   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_245"></A><A HREF="#fn_245"><FONT SIZE="1">246</FONT></A>
 			  And though Paul uses the particle <a name="xii.ii-p19.2"></A>&#947;&#8048;&#961; &#8212; for, yet I doubt not but that is only a simple confirmative, for there is here a kind of concession; for after having briefly defined what it is to be in the flesh, he now subjoins the end that awaits all who are slaves to the flesh. Thus by stating the contrary effect, he proves, that they cannot be 			 partakers of the favor of Christ, who abide in the flesh, for through the whole course of their life they proceed and hasten unto death.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p20"></A>This passage deserves special notice; for we hence learn, that we, while following the course of nature, rush headlong into death; for we, of ourselves, contrive nothing but what ends in ruin. But he immediately adds another clause, to teach us, that if anything in us tends to life, it is what the Spirit produces; for no spark of life proceeds from our flesh.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p21"></A>The minding of the Spirit he calls <i>life</i>, for it is life-giving, or leads to life; and by <i>peace</i> he designates, after the manner of the Hebrews, every kind of happiness; for whatever the Spirit of God works in us tends to 			 our felicity. There is, however, no reason why any one should on this account attribute salvation to works; for though God begins our salvation, and at length completes it by renewing us after his own image; yet the only cause is his good pleasure, whereby he makes us partakers of Christ.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p22"></A><a name="xii.ii-p22.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p23"></A><b>7.</b> <i>Because the minding of the flesh, </i>  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_246"></A><A HREF="#fn_246"><FONT SIZE="1">247</FONT></A>
 			  <i>etc.</i> He subjoins a proof of what he had stated, &#8212; that nothing proceeds from the efforts of our flesh but death, because it contends as an enemy against the will of God. Now the will of God is the rule of righteousness; it hence follows, that whatever is unjust is contrary to it; and what is unjust at the same time brings death. But while God is adverse, and is offended, in vain does any one expect life; for his 			 wrath must be necessarily followed by death, which is the avenging of his wrath. But let us observe here, that the will of man is in all things opposed to the divine will; for, as much as what is crooked differs from what is straight, so much must be the difference between us and God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p25"></A><i>For to the law of God</i>, <i>etc.</i> This is an explanation of the former sentence; and it shows how all the thinkings (<a name="xii.ii-p25.1"></A><i>meditationes</i>) of the flesh carry on war against the will of God; for his will cannot be 			 assailed but where he has revealed it. In the law God shows what pleases him: hence they who wish really to find out how far they agree with God must test all their purposes and practices by this rule. For though nothing is done in this world, except by the secret governing providence of God; yet to say, under this pretext, that nothing is done but what he approves, (<a name="xii.ii-p25.2"></A><i>nihil nisi eo approbante fieri</i><i>,)</i> is intolerable blasphemy; and on this subject some fanatics are wrangling at this day. The law has set the difference between right and wrong plainly and distinctly before our eyes, and to seek it in a deep labyrinth, what sottishness is it! The Lord has indeed, as I have said, his hidden counsel, by which he regulates all things as he pleases; but as it is incomprehensible to us, let us know that we are to refrain from too curious an investigation of it. 			 Let this in the mean time remain as a fixed principle, &#8212; that nothing pleases him but righteousness, and also, that no right estimate can be made of our works but by the law, in which he has faithfully testified what he approves and disapproves.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p26"></A><i>Nor can be</i>. Behold the power of free-will! which the Sophists cannot carry high enough. Doubtless, Paul affirms here, in express words, what they openly detest, &#8212; that it is impossible for us to render our powers subject to the law. They boast that the heart can turn to either side, provide it be aided by the influence of the Spirit, and that a free choice of 			 good or evil is in our power, when the Spirit only brings help; but it is ours to choose or refuse. They also imagine some good emotions, by which we become of ourselves prepared. Paul, on the contrary, declares, that the heart is full of hardness and indomitable contumacy, so that it is never moved naturally to undertake the yoke of God; nor does he speak of this or of that faculty, but speaking indefinitely, he throws into one bundle all the emotions which arise within us.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_247"></A><A HREF="#fn_247"><FONT SIZE="1">248</FONT></A>
 			  Far, then, from a Christian heart be this heathen philosophy respecting the liberty of the will. Let every one acknowledge himself to be the servant of sin, as he is in reality, that he may be made free, being set at liberty by the grace of Christ: to glory in any other liberty is the highest folly.</p>

Yet, at the same time, by explaining what the Spirit of God works in the elect, and what fruit he brings forth, he encourages them to strive after newness of life.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p10"></A><i>If indeed the Spirit of God</i>, <i>etc.</i> This qualifying sentence is fitly subjoined, by which they were stirred up to examine themselves more closely, lest they should profess the name of Christ in vain. And it is the surest mark by which the children of God are distinguished from the children of the world, when by 			 the Spirit of God they are renewed unto purity and holiness. It seems at the same time to have been his purpose, not so much to detect hypocrisy, as to suggest reasons for glorying against the absurd zealots of the law, who esteem the dead letter of more importance than the inward power of the Spirit, who gives life to the law.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p11"></A>But this passage shows, that what Paul has hitherto meant by the Spirit, is not the mind or understanding (which is called the superior part of the soul by the advocates of freewill) but a celestial gift; for he shows that those are spiritual, not such as obey reason through their own will, but such as God rules by his Spirit. Nor are they yet said to be according to the Spirit, because they are filled with God&#8217;s Spirit, (which is now the 			 case with none,) but because they have the Spirit dwelling in them, though they find some remains of the flesh still remaining in them: at the same time it cannot dwell in them without having the superiority; for it must be observed that man&#8217;s state is known by the power that bears rule in him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p12"></A><i>But if any have not the Spirit of Christ</i>, <i>etc.</i> He subjoins this to show how necessary in Christians is the denial of the flesh. The reign of the Spirit is the abolition of the flesh. Those in whom the Spirit reigns not, belong not to Christ; then they are not Christians who serve the flesh; for they who 			 separate Christ from his own Spirit make him like a dead image or a carcase. And we must always bear in mind what the Apostle has intimated, that gratuitous remission of sins can never be separated from the Spirit of regeneration; for this would be as it were to rend Christ asunder.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p13"></A>If this be true, it is strange that we are accused of arrogance by the adversaries of the gospel, because we dare to avow that the Spirit of Christ dwells in us: for we must either deny Christ, or confess that we become Christians through his Spirit. It is indeed dreadful to hear that men have so departed from the word of the Lord, that they not only vaunt that they are Christians without God&#8217;s Spirit, but also ridicule the faith of others: 			 but such is the philosophy of the Papists.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p14"></A>But let readers observe here, that the Spirit is, without any distinction, called sometimes the Spirit of God the Father, and sometimes the Spirit of Christ; and thus called, not only because his whole fulness was poured on Christ as our Mediator and head, so that from him a portion might descend on each of us, but also because he is equally the Spirit of the Father and of the Son, who have one essence, and the same eternal divinity. As, 			 however, we have no intercourse with God except through Christ, the Apostle wisely descends to Christ from the Father, who seems to be far off:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p15"></A><a name="xii.iii-p15.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p16"></A><b>10.</b> <i>But if Christ be in us</i>, <i>etc.</i> What he had before said of the Spirit he says now of Christ, in order that the mode of Christ&#8217;s dwelling in us might be intimated; for as by the Spirit he consecrates us as temples to himself, so by the same he dwells in us. 			 But what we have before referred to, he now explains more fully &#8212; that the children of God are counted spiritual, not on the ground of a full and complete perfection, but only on account of the newness of life that is begun in them. And he anticipates here an occasion of doubt, which might have otherwise disturbed us; for though the Spirit possesses a part of us, we yet see another part still under the power of death. He then gives this answer &#8212; that the power of quickening is in the Spirit of 			 Christ, which will be effectual in swallowing up our mortality. He hence concludes that we must patiently wait until the relics of sin be entirely abolished.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.iii-p17"></A>Readers have been already reminded, that by the word Spirit they are not to understand the soul, but the Spirit of regeneration; and Paul calls the Spirit life, not only because he lives and reigns in us, but also because he quickens us by his power, until at length, having destroyed the mortal fesh, he perfectly renews us. So, on the other hand, the word <i>body</i> signifies that gross mass which is not yet purified by the Spirit of God 			 from earthly dregs, which delight in nothing but what is gross; for it would be otherwise absurd to ascribe to the body the fault of sin: besides the soul is so far from being life that it does not of itself live. The meaning of Paul then is &#8212; that although sin adjudges us to death as far as the corruption of our first nature remains in us, yet that the Spirit of God is its conqueror: nor is it any hindrance, that we are only favored with the first-fruits, for even one spark of the Spirit is 			 the seed of life.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_248"></A><A HREF="#fn_248"><FONT SIZE="1">249</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xii.iii-p23"></A><i>Who raised</i>, <i>etc.</i> By this periphrasis he describes God; which harmonizes better with his present object, than if he had called him simply by his own name.

For it might have been objected, &#8220;That Christ was able by his own power to raise up himself, and this is what no man can do.&#8221; But when he says, that God raised up Christ by his Spirit, and that he also communicated his Spirit to us, there is nothing that can be alleged to the contrary; so that he thus makes sure to us the hope of resurrection.

He does not then pursue only the argument which he had before stated, but dwells more on another clause, which he had connected with it, even the paternal mercy of God, by which he forgives his people the infirmities of the flesh and the sins which still remain in them. He teaches us that our confidence in this respect is made certain by the Spirit of adoption, who could not inspire us with confidence in prayer without sealing to us a gratuitous pardon: and that he might make this more 			 evident, he mentions a twofold spirit; he calls one <i>the spirit of bondage</i>, which we receive from the law; and the other, <i>the spirit of adoption</i>, which proceeds from the gospel. The first, he says, was given formerly to produce fear; the other is given now to afford assurance. By such a comparison of contrary things the certainty of our salvation, which he intended to confirm, is, as you see, made 			 more evident.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_252"></A><A HREF="#fn_252"><FONT SIZE="1">253</FONT></A>
 			  The same comparison is used by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, where he says, that we have not come to Mount Sinai, where all thing were so terrible, that the people, being alarmed as it were by an immediate apprehension of death, implored that the word should be no more spoken to them, and Moses himself confessed that he was terrified;</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xii.v-p13"></A>&#8220;but to Sion, the mount of the Lord, and to his city, the heavenly Jerusalem, where Jesus is, the Mediator of the New Testament,&#8221; etc. (<a name="xii.v-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022">Heb. 12:22</a>, Heb. 24:0<a name="xii.v-p13.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.v-p14"></A>By the adverb again, we learn, that the law is here compared with the gospel: for the Son of God by his coming has brought to us this invaluable benefit, &#8212; that we are no longer bound by the servile condition of the law. You are not however to infer from this, either that no one before the coming of Christ was endued with the spirit of adoption, or that all who received the law were servants and not sons: for he compares the ministration of 			 the law with the dispensation of the gospel rather than persons with persons. I indeed allow that the faithful are here reminded how much more bountifully God now deals with them than he did formerly with the fathers under the Old Testament; he yet regards the outward dispensation, in respect of which only we excel them: for though the faith of Abraham, of Moses, and of David, was superior to ours, yet as God kept them apparently under a schoolmaster, they had not advanced into that liberty 			 which has been revealed to us.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.v-p15"></A>But it must at the same time be noticed, that it was designedly, on account of false apostles, that a contrast was made between the literal disciples of the law, and the faithful whom Christ, the heavenly Teacher, not only addresses by words, but also teaches inwardly and effectually by his Spirit.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.v-p16"></A>And though the covenant of grace is included under the law, it is yet far different from it; for in setting up the gospel in opposition to it, he regards nothing but what was peculiar to the law itself, as it commands and forbids, and restrains transgressors by the denunciation of death: and thus he gives the law its own character, in which it differs from the gospel; or this statement may be preferred by some, &#8212; &#8220;He sets forth the law only, 			 as that by which God covenants with us on the ground of works.&#8221; So then persons only must be regarded as to the Jewish people; for when the law was published, and also after it was published, the godly were illuminated by the same Spirit of faith; and thus the hope of eternal life, of which the Spirit is the earnest and seal, was sealed on their hearts. The only difference is, that the Spirit is more largely and abundantly poured forth in the kingdom of Christ. But if you regard only the 			 dispensation of the law, it will then appear, that salvation was first clearly revealed at that time, when Christ was manifested in the flesh. All things under the Old Testament were involved in great obscurity, when compared with the clear light of the gospel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.v-p17"></A>And then, if the law be viewed in itself, it can do nothing but restrain those, devoted to its miserable bondage, by the horror of death; for it promises no good except under condition, and denounces death on all transgressors. Hence, as there is the spirit of bondage under the law, which oppresses the conscience with fear; so under the gospel there is the spirit of adoption, which exhilarates our souls by bearing a testimony as to our 			 salvation. But observe, that <i>fear </i>is connected with bondage, as it cannot be otherwise, but that the law will harass and torment souls with miserable disquietness, as long as it exercises its dominion.

<p><a name="xii.v-p18"></A><i>Through whom we cry,</i> <i>etc.</i> He has changed the person, that he might describe the common privilege of all the saints; as though he had said, &#8212; &#8220;Ye have the spirit, through whom you and all we, the rest of the faithful, cry,&#8221; etc. The imitation of their language is very significant; when he introduces the word 			 Father, in the person of the faithful. The repetition of the name is for the sake of amplification; for Paul intimates, that God&#8217;s mercy was so published through the whole world, that he was invoked, as <a name="xii.v-p18.1"></A>Augustine observes, indiscriminately in all languages.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_253"></A><A HREF="#fn_253"><FONT SIZE="1">254</FONT></A>
 			  His object then was to express the consent which existed among all nations. It hence follows, that there is now no difference between the Jew and the Greek, as they are united together. Isaiah speaks differently when he declares, that the language of Canaan would be common to all, (<a name="xii.v-p19.10"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018">Isa 19:18</a><a name="xii.v-p19.10"></A>;) yet the meaning is the same; for he 			 had no respect to the external idiom, but to the harmony of heart in serving God, and to the same undisguised zeal in professing his true and pure worship. The word <i>cry</i> is set down for the purpose of expressing confidence; as though he said, &#8220;We pray not doubtingly, but we confidently raise up a loud voice to heaven.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.v-p20"></A>The faithful also under the law did indeed call God their Father, but not with such full confidence, as the vail kept them at a distance from the sanctuary: but now, since an entrance has been opened to us by the blood of Christ, we may rejoice fully and openly that we are the children of God; hence arises this crying. In short, thus is fulfilled the prophecy of Hosea,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xii.v-p21"></A>&#8220;I will say to them, My people are ye: they in their turn will answer, Thou art our God.&#8221; (<a name="xii.v-p21.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023">Ho 2:23</a><a name="xii.v-p21.1"></A>.)</p>

<p><a name="xii.v-p24"></A><b>16.</b> <i>The Spirit himself</i>, <i>etc.</i> He does not simply say, that God&#8217;s Spirit is a witness to our spirit, but he adopts a compound verb, which might be rendered &#8220;contest,&#8221; (<a name="xii.v-p24.1"></A><i>contestatur</i>,) were it not that contestation (<a name="xii.v-p24.2"></A><i>contestatio</i>) has a different meaning in Latin. But Paul means, that the Spirit of God gives us such a testimony, that when he is our guide and teacher, our spirit is made assured of the adoption of God: for our mind of its own self, without the preceding testimony of the Spirit, could not convey to 			 us this assurance. There is also here an explanation of the former verse; for when the Spirit testifies to us, that we are the children of God, he at the same time pours into our hearts such confidence, that we venture to call God our Father. And doubtless, since the confidence of the heart alone opens our mouth, except the Spirit testifies to our heart respecting the paternal love of God, our tongues would be dumb, so that they could utter no prayers. For we must ever hold fast this principle, 			 &#8212; that we do not rightly pray to God, unless we are surely persuaded in our hearts, that he is our Father, when we so call him with our lips. To this there is a corresponding part, &#8212; that our faith has no true evidence, except we call upon God. It is not then without reason that Paul, bringing us to this test, shows that it then only appears how truly any one believes, when they who have embraced the promise of grace, exercise themselves in prayers.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_254"></A><A HREF="#fn_254"><FONT SIZE="1">255</FONT></A>

 			 There is also an answer given here to their objection, for they ask, &#8220;How can a man fully know the will of God?&#8221; This certainly is not within the reach of man, but it is the testimony of God&#8217;s Spirit; and this subject he treats more at large in <a name="xii.v-p30.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006">1Co 2:6-16</a><a name="xii.v-p30.1"></A>, from which we may derive a fuller explanation of a passage. Let this truth then stand sure, &#8212; that no one can be 			 called a son of God, who does not know himself to be such; and this is called knowledge by John, in order to set forth its certainty.

<p><a name="xii.v-p32"></A><b>17.</b> <i>And if children</i>, <i>etc.</i> By an argument, taken from what is annexed or what follows, he proves that our salvation consists in having God as our Father. It is for children that inheritance is appointed: since God then has adopted us as his children, he has at the 			 same time ordained an inheritance for us. He then intimates what sort of inheritance it is &#8212; that it is heavenly, and therefore incorruptible and eternal, such as Christ possesses; and his possession of it takes away all uncertainty: and it is a commendation of the exellency of this inheritance, that we shall partake of it in common with the only-begotten Son of God. It is however the design of Paul, as it will presently appear more fully, highly to extol this inheritance promised to us, that 			 we may be contented with it, and manfully despise the allurements of the world, and patiently bear whatever troubles may press on us in this life.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.v-p33"></A><i>If so be that we suffer together</i>, <i>etc.</i> Various are the interpretations of this passage, but I approve of the following in preference to any other, &#8220;We are co-heirs with Christ, provided, in entering on our inheritance, we follow him in the same way in which he has gone before.&#8221; And he thus made mention of Christ, 			 because he designed to pass over by these steps to an encouraging strain, &#8212; &#8220;God&#8217;s inheritance is ours, because we have by his grace been adopted as his children; and that it may not be doubtful, its possession as been already conferred on Christ, whose partners we are become: but Christ came to it by the cross; then we must come to it in the same manner.&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_256"></A><A HREF="#fn_256"><FONT SIZE="1">257</FONT></A>
 			  Nor is that to be dreaded which some fear, that Paul thus ascribes the cause of our eternal glory to our labours; for this mode of speaking is not unusual in Scripture. He denotes the order, which the Lord follows in dispensing salvation to us, rather than the cause; for he has already sufficiently defended the gratuitous mercy of God against the merits of works. When now exhorting us to patience, he does not show whence salvation proceeds, 			 but how God governs his people.</p>

<p><a name="xii.vi-p11"></A><b>19</b>  <i>For the intent expectation of the creation</i>, <i>etc.</i> He teaches us that there is an example of the patience, to which he had exhorted us, even in mute creatures. For, to omit various interpretations, I understand the passage to have this 			 meaning &#8212; that there is no element and no part of the world which, being touched, as it were, with a sense of its present misery, does not intensely hope for a resurrection. He indeed lays down two things, &#8212; that all are creatures in distress, &#8212; and yet that they are sustained by hope. And it hence also appears how immense is the value of eternal glory, that it can excite and draw all things to desire it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.vi-p12"></A>Further, the expression, <i>expectation expects</i>, or waits for, though somewhat unusual, yet has a most suitable meaning; for he meant to intimate, that all creatures, seized with great anxiety and held in suspense with great desire, look for that day which shall openly exhibit the glory of the children of God. <i>The revelation 			 of God&#8217;s children</i> shall be, when we shall be like God, according to what John says,</p>

But he ascribes hope to creatures void of reason for this end, &#8212; that the faithful may open their eyes to behold the invisible life, though as yet it lies hid under a mean garb.</p>

<p><a name="xii.vi-p16"></A><b>20.</b> <i>For to vanity has the creation, etc.</i> He shows the object of expectation from what is of an opposite character; for as creatures, being now subject to corruption, cannot be restored until the sons of God shall be wholly restore; hence they, longing for their renewal, look forward to 			 the manifestation of the celestial kingdom. He says, that they have been <i>subjected to vanity</i>, and for this reason, because they abide not in a constant and durable state, but being as it were evanescent and unstable, they pass away swiftly; for no doubt he sets vanity in opposition to a perfect state.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.vi-p17"></A><i>Not willingly</i>, <i>etc.</i> Since there is no reason in such creatures, their will is to be taken no doubt for their natural inclination, according to which the whole nature of things tends to its own preservation and perfection: whatever then is detained under corruption suffers violence, nature being unwilling and 			 repugnant. But he introduces all parts of the world, by a sort of personification, as being endued with reason; and he does this in order to shame our stupidity, when the uncertain fluctuation of this world, which we see, does not raise our minds to higher things.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.vi-p18"></A><i>But on account of him,</i> <i>etc.</i> He sets before us an example of obedience in all created things, and adds, that it springs from hope; for hence comes the alacrity of the sun and moon, and of all the stars in their constant courses, hence is the sedulity of the earth&#8217;s obedience in bringing forth fruits, hence is 			 the unwearied motion of the air, hence is the prompt tendency to flow in water. God has given to everything its charge; and he has not only by a distinct order commanded what he would to be done, but also implanted inwardly the hope of renovation. For in the sad disorder which followed the fall of Adam, the whole machinery of the world would have instantly become deranged, and all its parts would have failed had not some hidden strength supported them. It would have been then wholly 			 inconsistent that the earnest of the Spirit should be less efficacious in the children of God than hidden instinct in the lifeless parts of creation. How much soever then created things do naturally incline another way; yet as it has pleased God to bring them under vanity, they obey his order; and as he has given them a hope of a better condition, with this they sustain themselves, deferring their desire, until the incorruption promised to them shall be revealed. He now, by a kind of 			 personification, ascribes <i>hope</i> to them, as he did <i>will</i> before.</p>

<p><a name="xii.vi-p20"></A><b>21.</b> <i>Because the creation itself</i>, <i>etc.</i> He shows how the creation has in hope been made subject to vanity; that is, inasmuch as it shall some time be made free, according to what Isaiah testifies, and what Peter confirms still more clearly. It is then indeed meet 			 for us to consider what a dreadful curse we have deserved, since all created things in themselves blameless, both on earth and in the visible heaven, undergo punishment for our sins; for it has not happened through their own fault, that they are liable to corruption. Thus the condemnation of mankind is imprinted on the heavens, and on the earth, and on all creatures. It hence also appears to what excelling glory the sons of God shall be exalted; for all creatures shall be renewed in order to 			 amplify it, and to render it illustrious.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.vi-p21"></A>But he means not that all creatures shall be partakers of the same glory with the sons of God; but that they, according to their nature, shall be participators of a better condition; for God will restore to a perfect state the world, now fallen, together with mankind. But what that perfection will be, as to beasts as well as plants and metals, it is not meet nor right in us to inquire more curiously; for the chief effect of corruption is 			 decay. Some subtle men, but hardly sober-minded, inquire whether all kinds of animals will be immortal; but if reins be given to speculations where will they at length lead us? Let us then be content with this simple doctrine, &#8212; that such will be the constitution and the complete order of things, that nothing will be deformed or fading.</p>

<p><a name="xii.vi-p23"></A><b>22.</b> <i>For we know</i>, <i>etc.</i> He repeats the same sentiment, that he might pass over to us, though what is now said has the effect and the form of a conclusion; for as creatures are subject to corruption, not through their natural desire, but through the appointment of 			 God, and then, as they have a hope of being hereafter freed from corruption, it hence follows, that they groan like a woman in travail until they shall be delivered. But it is a most suitable similitude; it shows that the groaning of which he speaks will not be in vain and without effect; for it will at length bring forth a joyful and blessed fruit. The meaning is, that creatures are not content in their present state, and yet that they are not so distressed that they pine away without a 			 prospect of a remedy, but that they are as it were in travail; for a restoration to a better state awaits them. By saying that they <i>groan together</i>, he does not mean that they are united together by mutual anxiety, but he joins them as companions to us. The particle <i>hitherto</i>, or, to this day, serves to alleviate the weariness of daily languor; for if 			 creatures have continued for so many ages in their groaning, how inexcusable will our softness or sloth be if we faint during the short course of a shadowy life.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_258"><FONT SIZE="1">259</FONT></A>

This view is indeed capable of being defended, but there seems to me to be a comparison here between the greater and the less; as though he said, &#8220;The excellency of our glory is of such importance even to the very elements, which are destitute of mind and reason, that they burn with a certain kind of desire for it; how much more it behoves us, who have been illuminated by the Spirit of God, to aspire and strive with firmness of hope and with ardour of desire, after the 			 attainment of so great a benefit.&#8221; And he requires that there should be a feeling of two kinds in the faithful: that being burdened with the sense of their present misery, they are to <i>groan;</i> and that notwithstanding they are to <i>wait</i> patiently for their deliverance; 			 for he would have them to be raised up with the expectation of their future blessedness, and by an elevation of mind to overcome all their present miseries, while they consider not what they are now, but what they are to be.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.vii-p10"></A><i>Who have the beginnings,</i> <i>etc.</i> Some render the word first-fruits, (<a name="xii.vii-p10.1"></A><i>primitias</i>,) and as meaning a rare and uncommon excellency; but of this view I by no means approve.

These, then, in the view of the Apostle, are beginnings or first-fruits, to which is opposed the complete ingathering; for as we are not yet endued with fullness, it is no wonder that we feel disquietude. By repeating <i>ourselves</i> and adding <i>in 			 ourselves</i>, he renders the sentence more emphatical, and expresses a more ardent desire, nor does he call it only a desire, but groaning: for in groaning there is a deep feeling of misery.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.vii-p11"></A><i>Waiting for the adoption,</i> <i>etc.</i> Improperly indeed, but not without the best reason, is adoption employed here to designate the fruition of the inheritance to which we are adopted; for Paul means this, that the eternal decree of God, by which he has chosen us to himself as sons before the foundation of the 			 world, of which he testifies to us in the gospel, the assurance of which he seals on our hearts by his Spirit, would be void, except the promised resurrection were certain, which is its consummation.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_259"></A><A HREF="#fn_259"><FONT SIZE="1">260</FONT></A>
 			  For to what end is God our Father, except he receives us after we have finished our earthly pilgrimage into his celestial inheritance? To the same purpose is what he immediately subjoins, <i>the redemption of the body</i>. For the price of our redemption was in such a way paid by Christ, that death should notwithstanding hold us tied by its chains, yea, that 			 we should carry it within us; it hence follows, that the sacrifice of the death of Christ would be in vain and fruitless, except its fruit appeared in our heavenly renovation.</p>

<p><a name="xii.vii-p14"></A><b>24.</b> <i>For by hope</i>, <i>etc.</i> Paul strengthens his exhortation by another argument; for our salvation cannot be separated from some kind of death, and this he proves by the nature of hope. Since hope extends to things not yet obtained, and represents to our minds the 			 form of things hidden and far remote, whatever is either openly seen or really possessed, is not an object of hope. But Paul takes it as granted, and what cannot be denied, that as long as we are in the world, salvation is what is hoped for; it hence follows, that it is laid up with God far beyond what we can see. By saying, that hope is not what is seen, he uses a concise expression, but the meaning is not obscure; for he means simply to teach us, that since hope regards some future and not 			 present good, it can never be connected with what we have in possession. If then it be grievous to any to groan, they necessarily subvert the order laid down by God, who does not call his people to victory before he exercises them in the warfare of patience. But since it has pleased God to lay up our salvation, as it were, in his closed bosom, it is expedient for us to toil on earth, to be oppressed, to mourn, to be afflicted, yea, to lie down as half-dead and to be like the dead; for they who 			 seek a visible salvation reject it, as they renounce hope which has been appointed by God as its guardian.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_260"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">261</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xii.vii-p17"></A><b>25.</b> <i>If then what we see not</i>, <i>etc.</i> This is an argument derived from what the antecedent implies; for patience necessarily follows hope. For when it is grievous to be without the good you may desire, unless you sustain and comfort yourselves with patience, you 			 must necessarily faint through despair. Hope then ever draws patience with it. Thus it is a most apt conclusion &#8212; that whatever the gospel promises respecting the glory of the resurrection, vanishes away, except we spend our present life in patiently bearing the cross and tribulations. For if life be invisible, we must have death before our eyes: if glory be invisible, then our present state is that of degradation. And hence if you wish to include in a few words the meaning of the whole 			 passage, arrange Paul&#8217;s arguments in this way, &#8220;To all the godly there is salvation laid up in hope; it is the character of hope to look forward to future and absent benefits: then the salvation of the faithful is not visible. Now hope is not otherwise sustained than by patience; then the salvation of the faithful is not to be consummated except by patience.&#8221;</p>

There is then no reason for any one to complain, that the bearing of the cross is beyond their own strength, since we are sustained by a celestial power. And there is great force in the Greek word <a name="xii.viii-p8.1"></A>&#963;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#8049;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;, which means that the Spirit takes on himself a part of the burden, by which our weakness is oppressed; so that he not only helps and succours us, but lifts us up; as 			 though he went under the burden with us.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_263"></A><A HREF="#fn_263"><FONT SIZE="1">264</FONT></A>
 			  The word <i>infirmities</i>, being in the plural number, is expressive of extremity. For as experience shows, that except we are supported by God&#8217;s hands, we are soon overwhelmed by innumerable evils, Paul reminds us, that though we are in every respect weak, and various infirmities threaten our fall, there is yet sufficient protection in God&#8217;s Spirit to 			 preserve us from falling, and to keep us from being overwhelmed by any mass of evils. At the same time these supplies of the Spirt more clearly prove to us, that it is by God&#8217;s appointment that we strive, by groanings and sighings, for our redemption.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.viii-p11"></A><i>For what we should pray for</i>, <i>etc.</i> He had before spoken of the testimony of the Spirit, by which we know that God is our Father, and on which relying, we dare to call on him as our Father. He now again refers to the second part, invocation, and says, that we are taught by the same Spirit how to pray, and 			 what to ask in our prayers. And appropriately has he annexed prayers to the anxious desires of the faithful; for God does not afflict them with miseries, that they may inwardly feed on hidden grief, but that they may disburden themselves by prayer, and thus exercise their faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.viii-p12"></A>At the same time I know, that there are various expositions of this passage;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_264"></A><A HREF="#fn_264"><FONT SIZE="1">265</FONT></A>
 			 but Paul seems to me to have simply meant this, &#8212; That we are blind in our addresses to God; for though we feel our evils, yet our minds are more disturbed and confused than that they can rightly choose what is meet and expedient. If any one makes this objection &#8212; that a rule is prescribed to us in God&#8217;s word; to this I answer, that our thoughts nevertheless continue oppressed with darkness, until the Spirit guides them by his light.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.viii-p14"></A><i>But the Spirit himself intercedes</i>,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_265"></A><A HREF="#fn_265"><FONT SIZE="1">266</FONT></A>
 			  <i>etc.</i> Though really or by the event it does not appear that our prayers have been heard by God, yet Paul concludes, that the presence of the celestial favor does already shine forth in the desire for prayer; for no one can of himself give birth to devout and godly aspirations. The unbelieving do indeed blab out their prayers, but they only trifle with God; for there is in them nothing sincere, or serious, or rightly 			 formed. Hence the manner of praying aright must be suggested by the Spirit: and he calls those groanings <i>unutterable</i>, into which we break forth by the impulse of the Spirit, for this reason &#8212; because they far exceed the capability of our own minds.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_266"></A><A HREF="#fn_266"><FONT SIZE="1">267</FONT></A>
 			  And the Spirit is said to <i>intercede</i>, not because he really humbles himself to pray or to groan, but because he stirs up in our hearts those desires which we ought to entertain; and he also affects our hearts in such a way that these desires by their fervency penetrate into heaven itself. And Paul has thus spoken, that he might more significantly ascribe the whole to the grace of the Spirit. 			 We are indeed bidden to knock; but no one can of himself premeditate even one syllable, except God by the secret impulse of his Spirit knocks at our door, and thus opens for himself our hearts.</p>

<p><a name="xii.viii-p18"></A><b>27.</b> <i>But he who searches hearts</i>, <i>etc.</i> This is a remarkable reason for strengthening our confidence, that we are heard by God when we pray through his Spirit, for he thoroughly knows our desires, even as the thoughts of his own Spirit. And here must be noticed 			 the suitableness of the word to <i>know;</i> for it intimates that God regards not these emotions of the Spirit as new and strange, or that he rejects them as unreasonable, but that he allows them, and at the same time kindly accepts them, as allowed and approved by him. As then Paul had before testified, that God then aids us when he draws us as it were into his own bosom, so now he 			 adds another consolation, that our prayers, of which he is the director, shall by no means be disappointed. The reason also is immediately added, because he thus conforms us to his own will. It hence follows, that in vain can never be what is agreeable to his will, by which all things are ruled. Let us also hence learn, that what holds the first place in prayer is consent with the will of the Lord, whom our wishes do by no means hold under obligation. If then we would have our prayers to be 			 acceptable to God, we must pray that he may regulate them according to his will.</p>  <a name="xii.ix"></A>

<p><a name="xii.ix-p9"></A><b>28.</b> <i>And we know</i>, <i>etc.</i> He now draws this conclusion from what had been said, that so far are the troubles of this life from hindering our salvation, that, on the contrary, they are helps to it. It is no objection that he sets down an illative particle, for it is no 			 new thing with him to make somewhat an indiscriminate use of adverbs, and yet this conclusion includes what anticipates an objection. For the judgment of the flesh in this case exclaims, that it by no means appears that God hears our prayers, since our afflictions continue the same. Hence the Apostle anticipates this and says, that though God does not immediately succour his people, he yet does not forsake them, for by a wonderful contrivance he turns those things which seem to be evils in such 			 a way as to promote their salvation. If any one prefers to read this verse by itself, as though Paul proceeded to a new argument in order to show that adversities which assist our salvation, ought not to be borne as hard and grievous things, I do not object. At the same time, the design of Paul is not doubtful: &#8220;Though the elect and the reprobate are indiscriminately exposed to similar evils, there is yet a great, difference; for God trains up the faithful by afflictions, and thereby promotes 			 their salvation.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ix-p10"></A>But we must remember that Paul speaks here only of adversities, as though he had said, &#8220;All things which happen to the saints are so overruled by God, that what the world regards as evil, the issue shows to be good.&#8221; For though what <a name="xii.ix-p10.1"></A>Augustine says is true, that even the sins of the saints are, through the guiding providence of God, so far from doing harm to them, that, on the contrary, they serve to 			 advance their salvation; yet this belongs not to this passage, the subject of which is the cross.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ix-p11"></A>It must also be observed, that he includes the whole of true religion in the love of God, as on it depends the whole practice of righteousness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ix-p12"></A><i>Even to them who according to his purpose,</i> <i>etc.</i> This clause seems to have been added as a modification, lest any one should think that the faithful, because they love God, obtain by their own merit the advantage of deriving such fruit from their adversities. We indeed know that when salvation is the subject, 			 men are disposed to begin with themselves, and to imagine certain preparations by which they would anticipate the favor of God. Hence Paul teaches us, that those whom he had spoken of as loving God, had been previously chosen by him. For it is certain that the order is thus pointed out, that we may know that it proceeds from the gratuitous adoption of God, as from the first cause, that all things happen to the saints for their salvation. Nay, Paul shows that the faithful do not love God before 			 they are called by him, as in another place he reminds us that the Galatians were known of God before they knew him. (<a name="xii.ix-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009">Ga 4:9</a><a name="xii.ix-p12.1"></A>.) It is indeed true what Paul intimates, that afflictions avail not to advance the salvation of any but of those who love God; but that saying of John is equally true, that then only he is begun to be loved by us, when he anticipates us by his gratuitous 			 love.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ix-p13"></A>But the calling of which Paul speaks here, has a wide meaning, for it is not to be confined to the manifestation of election, of which mention is presently made, but is to be set simply in opposition to the course pursued by men; as though Paul had said, &#8212; &#8220;The faithful attain not religion by their own efforts, but are, on the contrary led by the hand of God, inasmuch as he has chosen them to be a peculiar people to 			 himself.&#8221; The word <i>purpose</i> distinctly excludes whatever is imagined to be adduced mutually by men; as though Paul had denied, that the causes of our election are to be sought anywhere else, except in the secret good pleasure of God; which subject is more fully handled in the first chapter to the Ephesians, and in the first of the Second Epistle to Timothy; where also the contrast between this purpose and 			 human righteousness is more distinctly set forth.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_267"></A><A HREF="#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">268</FONT></A>
 			  Paul, however, no doubt made here this express declaration, &#8212; that our salvation is based on the election of God, in order that he might make a transition to that which he immediately subjoined, namely, that by the same celestial decree, the afflictions, which conform us to Christ, have been appointed; and he did this for the purpose of connecting, as by a kind of necessary chain, our salvation with the bearing of the cross.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ix-p16"></A><a name="xii.ix-p16.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ix-p17"></A><b>29.</b> <i>For whom he has foreknown</i>, <i>etc.</i> He then shows, by the very order of election, that the afflictions of the faithful are nothing else than the manner by which they are conformed to the image of Christ; and that this was necessary, he had before declared. There 			 is therefore no reason for us to be grieved, or to think it hard and grievous, that we are afflicted, unless we disapprove of the Lord&#8217;s election, by which we have been foreordained to life, and unless we are unwilling to bear the image of the Son of God, by which we are to be prepared for celestial glory.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ix-p18"></A>But the foreknowledge of God, which Paul mentions, is not a bare prescience, as some unwise persons absurdly imagine, but the adoption by which he had always distinguished his children from the reprobate.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_268"></A><A HREF="#fn_268"><FONT SIZE="1">269</FONT></A>
 			 In the same sense Peter says, that the faithful had been elected to the sanctification of the Spirit according to the foreknowledge of God. Hence those, to whom I have alluded, foolishly draw this inference, &#8212; That God has elected none but those whom he foresaw would be worthy of his grace. Peter does not in deed flatter the faithful, as though every one had been elected on account of his merit; but by reminding them of the eternal counsel of God, he wholly deprives them of all 			 worthiness. So Paul does in this passage, who repeats by another word what he had said before of God&#8217;s purpose. It hence follows, that this knowledge is connected with God&#8217;s good pleasure; for he foreknew nothing out of himself, in adopting those whom he was pleased to adopt; but only marked out those whom he had purposed to elect.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ix-p23"></A>The verb <a name="xii.ix-p23.1"></A>&#960;&#961;&#959;&#959;&#961;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;, which some translate, to <i>predestinate</i>, is to be understood according to what this passage requires; for Paul only meant, that God had so determined that all whom he has adopted should bear the image of Christ; nor has he simply said, that they were to be 			 conformed to Christ, but to <i>the image of Christ</i>, that he might teach us that there is in Christ a living and conspicuous exemplar, which is exhibited to God&#8217;s children for imitation. The meaning then is, that gratuitous adoption, in which our salvation consists, is inseparable from the other decree, which determines that we are to bear the cross; for no one can be an heir of heaven without being conformed 			 to the image of the only-begotten Son of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ix-p24"></A><i>That he may be, </i>or,<i> that he might be, the first-born</i>, <i>etc.</i>; for the Greek infinitive, <a name="xii.ix-p24.1"></A>&#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;, may be rendered in these two 			 ways; but I prefer the first rendering. But in mentioning Christ&#8217;s primogeniture, Paul meant only to express this, &#8212; that since Christ possesses a pre-eminence among the children of God, he is rightly given to us as a pattern, so that we ought to refuse nothing which he has been pleased to undergo. Hence, that the celestial Father may in every way bear testimony to the authority and honor which he has conferred on his own Son, he will have all those whom he adopts to be the heirs of his 			 kingdom, to be conformed to his example. Though indeed the condition of the godly is apparently various, as there is a difference between the members of the same body, there is yet a connection between every one and his own head. As then the first-born sustains the name of the family, so Christ is placed in a state of pre-eminence not only that he might excel in honor among the faithful, but also that he might include all under him himself under the common name of brotherhood.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ix-p25"></A><a name="xii.ix-p25.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ix-p26"></A><b>30.</b> <i>And whom he has foredetermined</i>, (<a name="xii.ix-p26.1"></A><a name="xii.ix-p26.2"></A>pr&aelig;finivit,) <i>them has he also called</i>, <i>etc.</i> That he might now by a clearer proof show how true it is that a conformity with the humiliating state of Christ is for our good, he adopts a graduating process, by which he teaches us, that a participation of the cross is so connected with our vocation, justification, and, in short, with our future glory, that they can by no means be separated.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ix-p27"></A>But that readers may better understand the Apostle&#8217;s meaning, it may be well to repeat what I have already said, &#8212; that the word <i>foredetermine</i> does not refer to election, but to that purpose or decree of God by which he has ordained that the cross is to be borne by his people; and by declaring that they are now called, he intimates, that God had not kept concealed what he had determined respecting them, but had made it known, that they 			 might resignedly and humbly submit to the condition allotted to them; for calling here is to be distinguished from secret election, as being posterior to it. That none then may make this objection &#8212; that it appears to no one what lot God has appointed for him, the Apostle says, that God by his calling bears an evident testimony respecting his hidden purpose. But this testimony is not only found in the outward preaching of the gospel, but it has also the power of the Spirit connected with it; 			 for the elect are there spoken of, whom God not only addresses by the outward word, but whom he also inwardly draws.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ix-p28"></A><i>Justification</i> may fitly be extended to the unremitted continuance of God&#8217;s favor, from the time of our calling to the hour of death; but as Paul uses this word throughout the Epistle, for gratuitous imputation of righteousness, there is no necessity for us to deviate from this meaning. What Paul indeed had in view was to show that a 			 more precious compensation is offered to us, than what ought to allow us to shun afflictions; for what is more desirable than to be reconciled to God, so that our miseries may no longer be tokens of a curse, nor lead us to ruin?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ix-p29"></A>He then immediately adds, that those who are now pressed down by the cross shall be<i> glorified;</i> so that their sorrows and reproaches shall bring them no loss. Though glorification is not yet exhibited except in our Head, yet as we in a manner behold in him our inheritance of eternal life, his glory brings to us 			 such assurance respecting our own glory, that our hope may be justly compared to a present possession.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ix-p30"></A>We may add, that Paul, imitating the style of the Hebrew language, adopts in these verbs the past instead of the present tense.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_269"></A><A HREF="#fn_269"><FONT SIZE="1">270</FONT></A>
 			 A continued act is no doubt what is meant, according to this import, &#8220;Those whom God now, consistently with his purpose, exercises under the cross, are called and justified, that they may have a hope of salvation, so that nothing of their glory decays during their humiliation; for though their present miseries deform it before the world, yet before God and angels it always shines forth as perfect.&#8221; What Paul then means by this gradation is, That the afflictions of the faithful, by 			 which they are now humbled, are intended for this end &#8212; that the faithful, having obtained the glory of the celestial kingdom, may reach the glory of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, with whom they are now crucified.</p>  <a name="xii.x"></A>

<p><a name="xii.x-p17"></A><b>31.</b> <i>What then</i>, <i>etc.</i> The subject discussed having been sufficiently proved, he now breaks out into exclamations, by which he sets forth the magnanimity with which the faithful ought to be furnished when adversities urge them to despond. And he teaches us in these 			 words that with the paternal favor of God is connected that invincible courage which overcomes all temptations. We indeed know, that judgment is usually formed of the love or of the hatred of God, in no other way than by a view of our present state; hence when things fall out untowardly, sorrow takes possession of our minds, and drives away all confidence and consolation. But Paul loudly exclaims, that a deeper principle ought to be inquired after, and that they reason absurdly who confine 			 themselves to the sad spectacle of our present warfare. I indeed allow, that the scourges of God are in themselves justly deemed to be tokens of God&#8217;s wrath; but as they are consecrated in Christ, Paul bids the saints to lay hold, above all things, on the paternal love of God, that relying on this shield they may boldly triumph over all evils; for this is a brazen wall to us, so that while God is propitious to us we shall be safe against all dangers. He does not, however, mean, that nothing 			 shall oppose us; but he promises a victory over all kinds of enemies.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p18"></A><i>If God be for us</i>, <i>etc.</i> This is the chief and the only support which can sustain us in every temptation. For except we have God propitious to us, though all things should smile on us, yet no sure confidence can be attained: but, on the other hand, his favor alone is a sufficient solace in every sorrow, a 			 protection sufficiently strong against all the storms of adversities. And on this subject there are many testimonies of Scripture, which show that when the saints rely on the power of God alone, they dare to despise whatever is opposed to them in the world.</p>

<p><a name="xii.x-p22"></A>For there is no power either under or above the heavens, which can resist the arm of God. Having him then as our defender, we need fear no harm whatever.

<p><a name="xii.x-p28"></A><b>33.</b> <i>Who shall bring an accusation,</i> <i>etc.</i> The first and the chief consolation of the godly in adversities, is to be fully persuaded of the paternal kindness of God; for hence arises the certainty of their salvation, and that calm quietness of the soul through which 			 it comes that adversities are sweetened, or at least the bitterness of sorrow mitigated. Hardly then a more suitable encouragement to patience could be adduced than this, a conviction that God is propitious to us; and hence Paul makes this confidence the main ground of that consolation, by which it behoves the faithful to be strengthened against all evils. And as the salvation of man is first assailed by accusation, and then subverted by condemnation, he in the first place averts the danger of 			 accusation. There is indeed but one God, at whose tribunal we must stand; then there is no room for accusation when he justifies us. The antithetic clauses seem not indeed to be exactly arranged; for the two parts which ought rather to have been set in opposition to each other are these: &#8220;Who shall accuse? Christ is he who intercedes:&#8221; and then these two might have been connected, &#8220;Who shall condemn? God is he who justifies;&#8221; for God&#8217;s absolution answers to condemnation, and Christ&#8217;s 			 intercession to accusation. But Paul has not without reason made another arrangement, as he was anxious to arm the children of God, as they say, from head to foot, with that confidence which banishes all anxieties and fears. He then more emphatically concludes, that the children of God are not subject to an accusation, because God justifies, than if he had said that Christ is our advocate; for he more fully expresses that the way to a trial is more completely closed up when the judge himself 			 pronounces him wholly exempt from guilt, whom the accuser would bring in as deserving of punishment. There is also a similar reason for the second clause; for he shows that the faithful are very far from being involved in the danger of condemnation, since Christ by expiating their sins has anticipated the judgment of God, and by his intercession not only abolishes death, but also covers our sins in oblivion, so that they come not to an account.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p29"></A>The drift of the whole is, that we are not only freed from terror by present remedies, but that God comes to our aid beforehand, that he may better provide for our confidence.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p30"></A>But it must be here observed, as we have before reminded you, that to be justified, according to Paul, is to be absolved by the sentence of God, and to be counted just; and it is not difficult to prove this from the present passage, in which he reasons by affirming one thing which nullifies its opposite; for to absolve and to regard persons as guilty, are contrary things. Hence God will allow no accusation against us, because he has absolved 			 us from all sins. The devil no doubt is an accuser of all the godly: the very law of God and their own conscience convict them; but all these prevail nothing with the judge, who justifies them. Therefore no adversary can shake or endanger our salvation.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p31"></A>Further, he so mentions the elect, as one who doubted not but that he was of their number; and he knew this, not by special revelation, (as some sophists falsely imagine,) but by a perception (<a name="xii.x-p31.1"></A><i>sensu</i> - feeling) common to all the godly. What then is here said of the elect, every one of the godly, according to the example of Paul, may apply to himself; for this doctrine would 			 have been not only frigid, but wholly lifeless had he buried election in the secret purpose of God. But when we know, that there is here designedly set before us what every one of the godly ought to appropriate to himself, there is no doubt but that we are all encouraged to examine our calling, so that we may become assured that we are the children of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p32"></A><a name="xii.x-p32.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p33"></A><b>34.</b> <i>Who is he that condemns?</i> <i>etc.</i> As no one by accusing can prevail, when the judge absolves; so there remains no condemnation, when satisfaction is given to the laws, and the penalty is already paid. Now Christ is he, who, having once for all suffered the 			 punishment due to us, thereby declared that he undertook our cause, in order to deliver us: he then who seeks hereafter to condemn us, must bring back Christ himself to death again. But he has not only died, but also came forth, by a resurrection, as the conqueror of death and triumphed over all its power.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p34"></A>He adds still more, &#8212; that he now <i>sits at the right hand</i> of the Father; by which is meant, that he possesses dominion over heaven and earth, and full power and rule over all things, according to what is said in <a name="xii.x-p34.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020">Eph 1:20</a><a name="xii.x-p34.1"></A>. He teaches us also, that he thus sits, that he may be a perpetual advocate and intercessor in securing our salvation. It hence follows, that when any one seeks to condemn us, he not only seeks to render void the death of Christ, but also contends with that unequalled power with which the Father has honored him, and who with that power conferred on him supreme authority. This so great an assurance; which dares to triumph over the devil, death, sin, and the 			 gates of hell, ought to lodge deep in the hearts of all the godly; for our faith is nothing, except we feel assured that Christ is ours, and that the Father is in him propitious to us. Nothing then can be devised more pestilent and ruinous, than the scholastic dogma respecting the uncertainty of salvation.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.x-p35"></A><i>Who intercedes</i>, <i>etc.</i> It was necessary expressly to add this, lest the Divine majesty of Christ should terrify us. Though, then, from his elevated throne he holds all things in subjection under his feet, yet Paul represents him as a Mediator; whose presence it would be strange for us to dread, since he not only 			 kindly invites us to himself, but also appears an intercessor for us before the Father. But we must not measure this intercession by our carnal judgment; for we must not suppose that he humbly supplicates the Father with bended knees and expanded hands; but as he appears continually, as one who died and rose again, and as his death and resurrection stand in the place of eternal intercession, and have the efficacy of a powerful prayer for reconciling and rendering the Father propitious to us, he 			 is justly said to intercede for us.</p>  <a name="xii.xi"></A>

<p><a name="xii.xi-p10"></A><b>35.</b> <i>Who shall separate us</i>, <i>etc.</i> The conviction of safety is now more widely extended, even to lower things; for he who is persuaded of God&#8217;s kindness towards him, is able to stand firm in the heaviest afflictions. These usually harass men in no small degree, and 			 for various reasons, &#8212; because they interpret them as tokens of God&#8217;s wrath, or think themselves to be forsaken by God, or see no end to them, or neglect to meditate on a better life, or for other similar reasons; but when the mind is purged from such mistakes, it becomes calm, and quietly rests. But the import of the words is, &#8212; That whatever happens, we ought to stand firm in this faith, &#8212; that God, who once in his love embraced us, never ceases to care for us. For he does not simply say that 			 there is nothing which can tear God away from his love to us; but he means, that the knowledge and lively sense of the love which he testifies to us is so vigorous in our hearts, that it always shines in the darkness of afflictions: for as clouds, though they obscure the clear brightness of the sun, do not yet wholly deprive us of its light; so God, in adversities, sends forth through the darkness the rays of his favor, lest temptations should overwhelm us with despair; nay, our faith, 			 supported by God&#8217;s promises as by wings, makes its way upward to heaven through all the intervening obstacles. It is indeed true, that adversities are tokens of God&#8217;s wrath, when viewed in themselves; but when pardon and reconciliation precede, we ought to be assured that God, though he chastises us, yet never forgets his mercy: he indeed thus reminds us of what we have deserved; but he no less testifies, that our salvation is an object of his care, while he leads us to repentance.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.xi-p11"></A>But he calls it<i> the love of Christ</i>, and for this reason, &#8212; because the Father has in a manner opened his compassions to us in him. As then the love of God is not to be sought out of Christ, Paul rightly directs to him our attention, so that our faith may behold, in the rays of Christ&#8217;s favor, the serene countenance of the Father. The 			 meaning is, &#8212; that in no adversities ought our confidence to be shaken as to this truth &#8212; that when God is propitious, nothing can be adverse to us. Some take this love in a passive sense, for that by which he is loved by us, as though Paul would have us armed with invincible courage   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">275</FONT></A>
 			  but this comment may be easily disproved by the whole tenor of Paul&#8217;s reasoning; and Paul himself will presently remove all doubt by defining more clearly what this love is.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.xi-p13"></A><i>Tribulation, or distress</i>,<i> or persecution?</i> <i>etc.</i> The pronoun masculine which he used at the beginning of the verse, contains a hidden power: for when he might have adopted the neuter gender and said &#8212; &#8220;What shall separate 			 us?&#8221; etc., he preferred ascribing personality to things without life, and for this end, &#8212; that he might send forth with us into the contest as many champions as there are of temptations to try our faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.xi-p14"></A>But these three things have this difference: <i>tribulation</i> includes every kind of trouble or evil; <i>distress</i> is an inward feeling, when difficulties reduce us to such an extremity, so that we know not what course to pursue. Such was the anxiety of Abraham and of Lot, when one was constrained to expose his 			 wife to the danger of prostitution, and the other, his daughters; for being brought to straits and being perplexed, they found no way of escape. <i>Persecution</i> properly denotes the tyrannical violence by which the children of God were undeservedly harassed by the ungodly. Now though Paul denies in <a name="xii.xi-p14.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008">2Co 4:8</a><a name="xii.xi-p14.1"></A>, that the children of 			 God are reduced to straits, <a name="xii.xi-p14.2"></A>&#963;&#964;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#967;&#969;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;, he does not yet disagree with himself; for he does not simply make them to be exempt from anxious solicitude, but he means that they are delivered from it, as also the examples of Abraham and Lot testify.</p>

<p><a name="xii.xi-p16"></A><b>36.</b> <i>As it is written</i>, <i>etc.</i> This testimony adds no small weight to the subject; for he intimates, that the dread of death is so far from being a reason to us for falling away, that it has been almost ever the lot of God&#8217;s servants to have death as it were present 			 before their eyes. It is indeed probable, that in that Psalm the miserable oppression of the people under the tyranny of Antiochus is described; for it is expressly said, that the worshippers of God were cruelly treated, for no other reason but through hatred to true religion. There is also added a remarkable protestation, that they had not departed from the covenant of God; which Paul, I think, had especially in view. It is no objection that the saints there complain of a calamity which then 			 unusually pressed on them; for since they show, that they were oppressed with so many evils, having before testified their innocence, an argument is hence fitly drawn, that it is no new thing for the Lord to permit his saints to be undeservedly exposed to the cruelty of the ungodly. But this is not done except for their good; for the Scripture teaches us, that it is alien to the righteousness of God to destroy the just with the wicked, (<a name="xii.xi-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023">Ge 18:23</a><a name="xii.xi-p16.1"></A>); but that, on the contrary, it is meet for him to requite affliction to those who afflict, and rest to those who are afflicted. (<a name="xii.xi-p16.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006">2 Thess. 1:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009">9</a><a name="xii.xi-p16.2"></A>.) And then they affirm that they suffer for the Lord; and Christ pronounces them blessed who suffer for the sake 			 of righteousness. (<a name="xii.xi-p16.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010">Mt 5:10</a><a name="xii.xi-p16.3"></A>.) By saying that they <i>died daily</i>, they intimated that death was so suspended over them, that their life differed but little from death.</p>

 			  though not commonly used by the Latins. It indeed sometimes happens that the faithful seem to succumb and to lie forlorn; and thus the Lord not only tries, but also humbles them. This issue is however given to them, &#8212; that they obtain the victory.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.xi-p21"></A>That they might at the same time remember whence this invincible power proceeds, he again repeats what he had said before: for he not only teaches us that God, because he loves us, supports us by his hand; but he also confirms the same truth by mentioning the love of Christ.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">277</FONT></A>
 			 And this one sentence sufficiently proves, that the Apostle speaks not here of the fervency of that love which we have towards God, but of the paternal kindness of God and of Christ towards us, the assurance of which, being thoroughly fixed in our hearts, will always draw us from the gates of hell into the light of life, and will sufficiently avail for our support.</p>  <a name="xii.xii"></A>

But <a name="xii.i-p18.8"></A>Pareus, following 				  <a name="xii.i-p18.9"></A>Ambrose, has taken another view, which <a name="xii.i-p18.10"></A>Haldane has strongly advocated, and with considerable power of reasoning, though, as some may perhaps think, unsuccessfully. The exposition is this, &#8212; &#8220;The law of the spirit of life&#8221; is the law of faith, or the gospel, which is the ministration of the Spirit; and &#8220;the spirit of life&#8221; means either the life-giving spirit, or the spirit which conveys the life which is in Christ Jesus. Then &#8220;the law 				  of sin and death&#8221; is the moral law, so called because it discloses sin and denounces death. It is said that this view corresponds with the &#8220;no condemnation&#8221; in the first verse, and with the word &#8220;law&#8221; in the verse which follows, which is no doubt the moral law, and with the truth which the verse exhibits. It is also added that freedom or deliverance from the law of sin, viewed as the power of sin, is inconsistent with the latter part of the former chapter; and that the law of faith, which 				  through the Spirit conveys life, makes us free from the moral law as the condition of life, is the uniform teaching of Paul. &#8220;This freedom,&#8221; says <a name="xii.i-p18.11"></A>Pareus, &#8220;is ascribed to God, to Christ, and to the Gospel, &#8212; to God as the author, <a name="xii.i-p18.12"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#025">Ro 7:25</a><a name="xii.i-p18.12"></A>, &#8212; to Christ as the mediator, &#8212; and to the Gospel as the instrument: and the manner of this deliverance is more clearly explained in the verse 				  which follows.&#8221;</p> 			 </P>

God... accomplished,&#8221; etc. But the simpler construction is, &#8220;For this,&#8221; (that is, freedom from the power of sin and death, mentioned in the former verse,) &#8220;<i>being </i>impossible for the law,&#8221; etc. It is instance of the nominative case absolute, which sometimes occurs in Hebrew. The possessive case, as <a name="xii.i-p24.7"></A>Grotius says, has often the meaning of a dative 				  after adjectives, as &#8220;<a name="xii.i-p24.8"></A>malum hominis&#8220; is &#8220;<a name="xii.i-p24.9"></A><i>malum homini</i> &#8212; evil to man.&#8221; The &#964;&#8056; has sometimes the meaning of &#964;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#959;; it is separated by &#947;&#8048;&#961; 				  from the adjective. Some say that it is for &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#947;&#8048;&#961;, &#8220;Because it was impossible for the law,&#8221; etc. But changes of this kind are never satisfactory. The rendering of the whole verse may be made thus, &#8212;</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xii.i-p25"></A><b>3. </b>For this <i>being </i>impossible for the law, because it was weak through the flesh, God having sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful a flesh and on account of sin, has condemned sin in the flesh.</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xii.i-p26"></A>God sent his Son in that flesh which was polluted by sin, though his Son&#8217;s flesh,<i> i.e.</i> human nature, was sinless; and he sent him on account of that sin which reigned in human nature or flesh; and for this end &#8212; to condemn, <i>i.e</i>., to doom to ruin, to adjudge to destruction, the sin which ruled in the flesh, <i>i.e</i>. in human nature as fallen and corrupted. This seems to be the meaning. Then in the following verse the design of 				  this condemnation of sin is stated &#8212; that the righteousness of the law, or what the law requires, might be done by us. Without freedom from the power of sin, no service can be done to God. It is the destruction of the power of sin, and not the removal of guilt, that is contemplated here throughout; the text of the whole passage is walking after the flesh and walking after the Spirit. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

That &#8220;sin&#8221; should have two different meanings in the same verse or in the same clause, is what is perfectly consonant to the Apostle&#8217;s manner of writing; he seems to delight in this kind of contrast in meaning while using the same words, depending on the context as to the explanation.

<p class="Super"><a name="xii.i-p34"></A>Fully admitting all this, I still think that &#8220;sin&#8221; here is to be taken in its common meaning, only personified. <a name="xii.i-p34.1"></A>Beza connects &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8055;&#945;&#962; with the preceding clause, &#8220;God having sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and that for or on account of sin, (<a name="xii.i-p34.2"></A>idque pro peccato,)&#8221; etc., that is, as he explains, for expiating or taking away sin. &#8220;A sin-offering&#8221; may indeed be its meaning, for the same expression is often used in this sense in the <i>Septuagint</i>. See <a name="xii.i-p34.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#007">Lev. 5:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#009">9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011">11</a><a name="xii.i-p34.3"></A>; <a name="xii.i-p34.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006">Ps 40:6</a><a name="xii.i-p34.4"></A></p>

<p class="Super"><a name="xii.i-p42"></A> Commentators are divided as to the meaning of this verse. This and the second verse seem to bear a relation in sense to one another; so that if the second verse refers to justification, this also refers to it; but if freedom from the <i>power </i>of sin and death be what is taught in the former verse, the actual or personal fulfillment of the law must be what is intended here. Some, such as <a name="xii.i-p42.1"></A>Pareus and 				  <a name="xii.i-p42.2"></A>Venema, consider justification to be the subject of both verses; and others, such as <a name="xii.i-p42.3"></A>Scott and <a name="xii.i-p42.4"></A>Doddridge, consider it to be sanctification. But <a name="xii.i-p42.5"></A>Beza, <a name="xii.i-p42.6"></A>Chalmers, as well as <a name="xii.i-p42.7"></A>Calvin, somewhat inconsistently, regard the second verse as speaking of freedom from the power or dominion of sin, and not from its guilt or 				  condemnation, and this verse as speaking of the imputed righteousness of Christ, and not of that righteousness which believers are enabled to perform by the Spirit&#8217;s aid and influence. The verses seem so connected in the argument, that one of these two ideas must be held throughout.</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xii.i-p43"></A>There is nothing <i>decisive</i> in the wording of this verse, though the cast of the expressions seem more favorable to the idea entertained by <a name="xii.i-p43.1"></A>Doddridge and <a name="xii.i-p43.2"></A>Scott, and especially what follows in the context, where the work of the Spirit is exclusively 				  spoken of. The word &#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#969;&#956;&#945;, is better rendered &#8220;righteousness&#8221; than &#8220;justification;&#8221; for &#8220;the righteousness to the law&#8221; means the righteousness which the law requires; and the words &#8220;might be fulfilled in us,&#8221; may, with equal propriety as to the <a name="xii.i-p43.3"></A><i>uses loquendi</i>, be rendered, &#8220;might be performed by us.&#8221; The verb &#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#8057;&#969; has this meaning in <a name="xii.i-p43.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008">Ro 13:8</a><a name="xii.i-p43.4"></A>, and in other places.</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xii.i-p44"></A>Viewed in this light the verse contains the same truth with what is expressed by &#8220;serving the law of God,&#8221; in <a name="xii.i-p44.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#025">Ro 7:25</a><a name="xii.i-p44.1"></A>, and the same with yielding our members as &#8220;instruments of righteousness unto God,&#8221; in <a name="xii.i-p44.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013">Ro 6:13</a><a name="xii.i-p44.2"></A>. That this is to establish a justification by the law, is 				  obviated by the consideration, that this righteousness is performed through the efficacy of Christ&#8217;s death, and through the reviving power of the Spirit, and not through the law, and that it is not a justifying righteousness before God, for it is imperfect, and the law can acknowledge nothing as righteousness but what is perfect. The sanctification now begun will be finally completed; but it is all through grace: and the completion of this work will be a complete conformity with the immutable 				  law of God. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

The mindedness, rather than the minding of the flesh, would be most correct. But the phrase is no doubt Hebraistic, the adjective is put as a noun in the genitive case, so that its right version 				  is, &#8220;The carnal mind;&#8221; and &#8220;mind&#8221; is to be taken in the wide sense of the verb, as including the whole soul, understanding, will, and affections. The phrase is thus given in the next verse in our version; and it is the most correct rendering. The mind of the flesh is its thoughts, desires, likings, and delight. This carnal mind is death,<i> i.e</i>., spiritual death now, leading to that which is eternal; or death, as being under condemnation, and 				  producing wretchedness and misery; it is also enmity towards God, including in its very spirit hatred and antipathy to God. On the other hand, &#8220;the spiritual mind&#8221; is &#8220;life,&#8221; <i>i.e</i>., a divine life, a living principle of holiness, accompanied with &#8220;peace,&#8221; which is true happiness; or life by justification, and &#8220;peace&#8221; with God as the fruit of it.</p>

Hence he stigmatizes with the name of &#8220;metaphysical reasoning&#8221; the doctrine of man&#8217;s moral inability, without divine grace, to turn to God &#8212; a doctrine which <a name="xii.ii-p27.2"></A>Luther, <a name="xii.ii-p27.3"></A>Calvin, and our own Reformers equally maintained.

The influence of &#8220;other principles and motives,&#8221; or the grace of God? This is no metaphysical question, and the answer to it determines the point. Our other American brother, <a name="xii.ii-p27.4"></A>Barnes, seems also to deprecate this doctrine of moral inability, and makes distinctions to no purpose, attempting 				  to separate the carnal mind from him in whom it exists, as though man could be in a neutral state, neither in the flesh nor in the Spirit. &#8220;It is an expression,&#8221; as our third American brother, <a name="xii.ii-p27.5"></A>Hodge, justly observes, &#8220;applied to<i> all</i> unrenewed persons, as those who are not in the flesh are in the Spirit.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

<p class="Super"><a name="xii.iii-p18"></A> There are mainly two explanations of this verse and the following, with some shades of difference. The one is given here; according to which &#8220;the body,&#8221; and &#8220;bodies,&#8221; are taken figuratively for nature corrupted by sin; the &#8220;body,&#8221; as it is flesh, or corrupted, is &#8220;dead,&#8221; is crucified, or doomed to die &#8220;on account of sin;&#8221; and this &#8220;body,&#8221; or these &#8220;bodies,&#8221; which are mortal, and especially so as to their corruption, are to be 				  quickened, revived, and made subservient to the will of God.

In <a name="xii.ix-p19.8"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020">1Pe 1:20</a><a name="xii.ix-p19.8"></A>, it is applied to Christ as having been &#8220;foreordained,&#8221; according to our version, &#8220;before the foundation of the world.&#8221; In this Epistle, 				  <a name="xii.ix-p19.9"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002">Ro 11:2</a><a name="xii.ix-p19.9"></A>, it refers to God, &#8212; &#8220;God hath not cast away his people whom he foreknew;&#8221; and according to the context, it means the same as elected; for the Apostle speaks of what God did &#8220;according to the election of grace,&#8221; and not according to foreseen faith.</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xii.ix-p20"></A>The noun derived from it is found in two places, <a name="xii.ix-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023">Ac 2:23</a><a name="xii.ix-p20.1"></A>, and <a name="xii.ix-p20.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002">1Pe 1:2</a><a name="xii.ix-p20.2"></A>. In the first it evidently means decree, foreordination, and in the second, the same; where it is said, that those addressed by the Apostle 				  were elected, &#8220;according to the foreknowledge of God, &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#8057;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#920;&#949;&#959;&#8166;, through the sanctification of the Spirit, <i>unto</i> obedience;&#8221; they were not then elected, according to God&#8217;s foreknowledge or foreordination, <i>because </i>of their obedience. This entirely subverts the gloss put on the verb in this passage.</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xii.ix-p21"></A>The usual meaning given to the verb here is fore-approved, or chosen. <a name="xii.ix-p21.1"></A>Grotius, <a name="xii.ix-p21.2"></A>Turrettin, and others, consider that &#947;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#969; has the same meaning with the verb <a name="xii.ix-p21.3"></A>&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, in Hebrew, which is sometimes that of approving or favoring, or regarding with love and approbation. So the compound verb may be rendered here, &#8220;whom he fore-approved, or foreknew,&#8221; as the objects of his choice: and this idea is what alone comports with the rest of the passage.</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xii.ix-p22"></A><a name="xii.ix-p22.1"></A>Stuart prefers another meaning, and that which it seems to have in <a name="xii.ix-p22.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020">1Pe 1:20</a><a name="xii.ix-p22.2"></A>, &#8220;foreordained.&#8221; He says that &#947;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#969; means sometimes to will, to determine, to ordain, to decree, and brings examples from <a name="xii.ix-p22.3"></A>Josephus, <a name="xii.ix-p22.4"></A>Plutarch, and <a name="xii.ix-p22.5"></A>Polybius.

<p class="Super"><a name="xii.xi-p12"></A> According to <a name="xii.xi-p12.1"></A>Poole, several of the Fathers entertained this opinion, such as <a name="xii.xi-p12.2"></A>Origen, <a name="xii.xi-p12.3"></A>Chrysostom, <a name="xii.xi-p12.4"></A>Theodoret, and <a name="xii.xi-p12.5"></A>Ambrose<i>:</i> but even <a name="xii.xi-p12.6"></A>Hammond and <a name="xii.xi-p12.7"></A>Grotius, great admirers of the Fathers, regard this love as that of 				  God or of Christ to us. <a name="xii.xi-p12.8"></A>Wolfius says, that all the Lutheran divines give this exposition. It is indeed impossible rightly to view the whole passage without seeing that this explanation is the true one. In verse 32, it is incontestably evident that God&#8217;s love to us is what is spoken of: then in verse 37, it is expressly said, &#8220;through him who loved us;&#8221; and the last verse seems sufficient to remove every possible doubt. The difficulty of <a name="xii.xi-p12.9"></A>Barnes, in thinking it &#8220;not conceivable how afflictions should have any tendency to alienate Christ&#8217;s love <i>from us</i>,&#8221; arises from a misconception: for when we speak of not being separated from the love of Christ, the obvious meaning is, that nothing can separate us from participating in the effects of his love, that He, on account of his love, will sustain us under the greatest trials, and make &#8220;us more than conquerors.&#8221; The substance of what is here said, is 				  contained in the last clause of <a name="xii.xi-p12.10"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032">Ro 8:32</a><a name="xii.xi-p12.10"></A>, &#8212; &#8220;How shall he not with him also freely give us all things?&#8221; It was the assurance of this truth that the Apostle obviously intended to convey. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

<p class="Super"><a name="xii.xii-p16"></A>The whole passage is sublime in an extraordinary degree. The contrast is the grandest that can be conceived.
