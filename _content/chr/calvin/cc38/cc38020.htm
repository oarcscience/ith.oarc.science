<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref16"><a name="xxi.i-p2"></A>CHAPTER 1</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p3"></A><b>1 </b>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called Apostle, chosen for the gospel of God,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Which he had before promised by his Prophets in the holy Scriptures,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Concerning his Son, who came from the seed of David according to the flesh;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Declared the Son of&#8217; God in power, through the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, <i>even </i>Jesus Christ our Lord;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Through whom we have received grace and apostleship for the obedience of faith among all nations, for his name&#8217;s sake;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Among whom ye are also the called of Jesus Christ;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p9"></A><b>7 </b>To all of you who are at Rome, beloved by God, called saints: grace to you, and peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p10"></A><b>8 </b>First indeed I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, for you all, because your faith is proclaimed through the whole world.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p11"></A><b>9 </b>For my witness is God, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that I continually make mention of you, in all my prayers,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Requesting that by some means a prosperous journey may some time be given me, through God&#8217;s will, to come to you:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p13"></A><b>11 </b>For I desire to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to confirm you;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p14"></A><b>12 </b>That is, that we may mutually partake of encouragement through mutual faith, even yours and mine.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p15"></A><b>13 </b>And I would not that you should not know, brethren, that I have often proposed to come to you, (and have been hitherto hindered,) that I might have some fruit among you as also among other nations.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p16"></A><b>14 </b>Both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish, am I a debtor;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p17"></A><b>15 </b>So that, as far as I can, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also who are at Rome;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p18"></A><b>16 </b>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, since it is the power of God for salvation to every one who believes, to the Jew first, then to the Greek;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p19"></A><b>17 </b>For the righteousness of God is in it revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, &#8220;The just by his faith shall live.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p20"></A><b>18 </b>Revealed also is the wrath of God from heaven, against all the impiety and injustice of men, who unjustly suppress the truth of God;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p21"></A><b>19 </b>Because what may be known of God, is manifest in them, for God has manifested it to them;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p22"></A><b>20 </b>Since his invisible things are seen from the creation of the world, being understood by his works, even his eternal power and divinity, so that they are inexcusable;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p23"></A><b>21 </b>inasmuch as when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, nor were thankful; but became vain in their thoughts, and darkened was their foolish heart:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p24"></A><b>22 </b>When they thought themselves wise, they became fools,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p25"></A><b>23 </b>And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image, <i>into that </i>of a corruptible man and of birds and of quadrupeds and of reptiles.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p26"></A><b>24 </b>Therefore God gave them up to the lusts of their own hearts for uncleanness, that they might degrade their bodies among themselves,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p27"></A><b>25 </b>Who had transformed the truth respecting God into falsehood, and worshipped and adored the creature above the Creator; who is blessed for ever; Amen</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p28"></A><b>26 </b>Therefore, I say, God gave them up to disgraceful passions; for their women turned the natural habit into that which is contrary to nature;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p29"></A><b>27 </b>And in like manner the men also, having left off the natural use of the woman, burned with mutual lust, one towards another, males working filthiness with males, and receiving in themselves the reward due to them for their going astray.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p30"></A><b>28 </b>And as they chose not to retain the knowledge of God, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do things not becoming;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p31"></A><b>29 </b>That they might be full of all unrighteousness, wickedness, lust, avarice, malignity, being filled with envy, murder, strife, guile, perversity, <i>being </i>whisperers,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p32"></A><b>30 </b>Calumniators, haters of God, villaneus, disdainful, haughty, inventors of evils, disobedient to parents,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p33"></A><b>31 </b>Without understanding, insociable, void of natural affections, truce-breakers, merciless;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.i-p34"></A>32 Who, when they knew the judgment of God, that they who do such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but approve of those who do them.</p>  <a name="xxi.ii"></A>  		  
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref31"><a name="xxi.ii-p1"></A>  		  
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref16"><a name="xxi.ii-p2"></A>CHAPTER 2</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p3"></A><b>1 </b>Therefore inexcusable art thou, O man, who judgest; for in what thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself, for the same things doest thou who judgest.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Now we know that God&#8217;s judgment is according to truth on those who do such things.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And thinkest thou, O man, who judgest those who do such things and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and gentleness, not knowing that the goodness of God leads thee to repentance?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>But according to thy hardness and a heart that cannot repent, thou treasurest for thyself wrath for the day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Who will render to every one according to his works, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>To those indeed, who by perseverance in doing good, seek glory and honor and immortality, eternal life;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>But to those who are contentious and disobedient to the truth and obey unrighteousness, <i>there shall be </i>indignation and wrath,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Tribulation and anguish <i>shall be </i>on every soul of man who doeth evil, the Jew first, then the Greek;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>But glory and honor and peace <i>shall be </i>to every one who works good, to the Jew first, then to the Greek;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>Since there is no respect of persons with God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>For whosoever have without the law sinned, shall also without the law perish; but whosoever have under the law sinned, shall by the law be judged,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p15"></A><b>13 </b>For not the hearers of the law are just before God; but they who do the law shall be justified.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p16"></A><b>14</b> When indeed the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature the things of the law, they, having not the law, are a law to themselves;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p17"></A><b>15 </b>Who show the work of the law written on their hearts, their conscience at the same time attesting, and their thoughts accusing or excusing each other,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p18"></A><b>16 </b>In the day in which God will judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, through Jesus Christ.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p19"></A><b>17 </b>Behold, thou art named a Jew, and restest in the law and gloriest in God,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p20"></A><b>18 </b>And knowest his will and approvest of things excellent, being instructed from the law,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p21"></A><b>19 </b>And art confident that thou thyself art a leader to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p22"></A><b>20 </b>An instructor to the foolish, a teacher to the ignorant, because thou hast the form of knowledge and of&#8217; the truth according to the law:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p23"></A><b>21 </b>Yet thou who teachest another, dost not teach thyself; thou who preachest &#8220;steal not,&#8221; stealest;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p24"></A><b>22 </b>Thou who sayest, &#8220;commit no adultery,&#8221; committest adultery; thou who hatest idols, committest sacrilege;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p25"></A><b>23 </b>Thou who gloriest in the law, by transgressing the law dishonorest God; for the name of God,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p26"></A><b>24 </b>As it is written, is reproached on your account among the nations.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p27"></A><b>25 </b>For circumcision indeed profits, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is turned into uncircumcision.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p28"></A><b>26 </b>If then the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p29"></A><b>27 </b>And shall not he who is by nature uncircumcision judge thee, (if he keep the law,) who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p30"></A><b>28 </b>For not he who is <i>a Jew </i>openly, is a Jew; nor is that circumcision which is openly in the flesh:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.ii-p31"></A>29 But he who is one in secret is a Jew; and circumcision is <i>that </i>of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; the praise of whom is not from men, but from God.</p>  <a name="xxi.iii"></A>  		  
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref31"><a name="xxi.iii-p1"></A>  		  
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref16"><a name="xxi.iii-p2"></A>CHAPTER 3</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p3"></A><b>1 </b>What then is the privilege of the Jew, or what is the benefit of circumcision?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Much in every way; and first indeed, because to them have been intrusted the oracles of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>What indeed if some have not believed? Shall their unbelief render void the faithfulness of God?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>By no means; but let God be true, and every man false, as it is written, &#8220;That thou mightest be justified in thy words, and overcome when thou art judged.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust who executes wrath? (according to man I speak:)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>By no means; for how then shall God judge the world?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>If indeed the truth of God has through my falsehood redounded to his glory, why still am even I judged as a sinner, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>And <i>why </i>not (as we are reproached, and as some declare that we say) &#8220;Let us do evils, that good things may come?&#8221; the judgment of whom is just.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>What then? do we excel? Not at all; for we have before brought a charge against both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>As it is written, &#8220;There is none righteous, not indeed one;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>There is none who understands, There is none who seeks God;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>All have turned aside; they have become together unprofitable; there is none who doeth kindness, no, not even one:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p15"></A><b>13 </b>An open grave is their throat; with <i>their </i>tongues have they dealt deceitfully: The poison of asps is under their lips:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p16"></A><b>14 </b>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p17"></A><b>15 </b>Swift are their feet to shed blood;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p18"></A><b>16 </b>Ruin and misery are in their ways;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p19"></A><b>17 </b>And the way of peace have they not known:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p20"></A><b>18 </b>There is no fear of God before their eyes.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p21"></A><b>19 </b>Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may become guilty before God:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p22"></A><b>20 </b>Because no flesh shall by the works of the law be justified before him, since by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p23"></A><b>21 </b>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being approved by the law and the Prophets, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p24"></A><b>22 </b>Even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ, <i>which is </i>to all and upon all who believe: there is indeed no difference;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p25"></A><b>23 </b>For all have sinned, and are become destitute of the glory of God;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p26"></A><b>24 </b>And they are justified gratuitously by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p27"></A><b>25 </b>Whom God has set forth <i>as </i>a propitiatory through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness on account of the remission of sins, which before existed through the forbearance of God, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p28"></A><b>26 </b>For a demonstration of his righteousness, at this time, that he might be just. and the justifier of him who believes in Jesus.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p29"></A><b>27 </b>Where then is glorying? It is excluded: by what law? Of works? no; but by the law of faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p30"></A><b>28 </b>We then conclude, that by faith is man justified without the works of the law.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p31"></A><b>29 </b>Is he the God of the Jews only? and not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p32"></A>30 Since one is God, who will justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iii-p33"></A>31 Do we then make void the law by faith? By no means; but we confirm the law.</p>  <a name="xxi.iv"></A>  		  
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref31"><a name="xxi.iv-p1"></A>  		  
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref16"><a name="xxi.iv-p2"></A>CHAPTER 4</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p3"></A><b>1 </b>What shall we then say, that Abraham, our father according to the flesh, had obtained?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p4"></A><b>2 </b>For if Abraham was by works justified, he has what he may glory in, but not before God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p5"></A><b>3 </b>But what saith the Scripture? &#8220;Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p6"></A><b>4 </b>To him indeed who works the reward is not imputed as a grace, but as a debt:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p7"></A><b>5 </b>But to him who works not, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, imputed is his faith for righteousness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p8"></A><b>6 </b>As David also describes the blessedness of the man, to whom God imputes righteousness without works,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p9"></A><b>7 </b>&#8220;Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p10"></A><b>8 </b>Blessed is the man to whom God has not imputed sin.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p11"></A><b>9 </b><i>Was </i>then this blessedness on the circumcision <i>only, </i>or also on the uncircumcision? for we say, that imputed to Abraham was faith for righteousness:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p12"></A><b>10 </b>How then was it imputed? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p13"></A><b>11 </b>And he received the sign of circumcision <i>as </i>a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all who believe while in uncircumcision, in order that to them also righteousness might be imputed, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p14"></A><b>12 </b>And the father of the circumcision, not to those who are in circumcision only, but who walk in the footsteps of that faith which our father Abraham had in uncircumcision.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p15"></A><b>13 </b>It was not indeed by the law that the promise was to Abraham and to his seed, that he should be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p16"></A><b>14 </b>For if they who are of the law are heirs, <i>then </i>made void is faith, and abolished is the promise.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p17"></A><b>15 </b>For the law causeth wrath: but where no law is, there is also no transgression.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p18"></A><b>16 </b>It is therefore by faith, that <i>it might be </i>through grace, in order that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but which also is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p19"></A><b>17 </b>(As it is written, &#8220;The father of many nations have I made thee,&#8221;) before God whom he believed, who quickens the dead, and calls things which are not, as though they were:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p20"></A><b>18 </b>Who against hope believed through hope, that he would be the father of many nations, according to what had been said, &#8220;So shall thy seed be.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p21"></A><b>19 </b>And being not in faith weak, he considered not his own body, now dead, when he was nearly an hundred years old, nor the dead womb of Sarah;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p22"></A><b>20 </b>Nor did he indeed search into the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened by faith, giving glory to God;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p23"></A><b>21 </b>And being assuredly persuaded, that what he had promised he was also able to perform:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p24"></A><b>22 </b>And it was therefore imputed to him for righteousness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p25"></A><b>23 </b>Now it was not written on his account only, that it was imputed to him</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p26"></A><b>24 </b>But also on our account, to whom it shall be imputed, <i>even to us </i>who believe on him, who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.iv-p27"></A>25 Who was delivered for our offenses and raised for our justification.</p>  <a name="xxi.v"></A>  		  
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref31"><a name="xxi.v-p1"></A>  		  
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref16"><a name="xxi.v-p2"></A>CHAPTER 5</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.v-p3"></A><b>1 </b>Being then justified, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.v-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Through whom we have had access by faith to this grace in which we stand, and glory in the hope of the glory of God:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.v-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And not only so, but we glory also in tribulations; knowing that tribulation produces patience;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.v-p6"></A><b>4 </b>And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.v-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Moreover, hope makes <i>us </i>not ashamed, because the love of God is diffused in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.v-p8"></A><b>6 </b>For Christ, when we were as yet as to time weak, died for the ungodly.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.v-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Hardly indeed for the just will any one die; but for the good perhaps some one may even venture to die:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.v-p10"></A><b>8 </b>But God confirms his love towards us, because when we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</p>

<p><a name="xxi.x-p3"></A><b>1 </b>Brethren, the kind desire of my heart, and prayer to God for Israel, is for <i>their </i>salvation.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.x-p4"></A><b>2 </b>For I bear to them a testimony, that they have a zeal for God; but not according to knowledge,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.x-p5"></A><b>3 </b>For being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to the righteousness of God;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.x-p6"></A><b>4 </b>For the end of the law is Christ for righteousness to every one who believes.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.x-p7"></A><b>5 </b>For Moses describes the righteousness which is by the law, &#8220;The man who shall do these things shall live by them:&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.x-p8"></A><b>6 </b>But the righteousness, which is by faith, saith thus, &#8220;Say not in thine heart, &#8216;Who shall ascend into heaven?&#8217; this is to bring, down Christ;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.x-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Or, &#8216;Who shall descend into the deep?&#8217; that is to bring up Christ again from the dead:&#8221; but what does it say?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.x-p10"></A><b>8 </b>&#8220;Nigh thee is the word, in thy mouth and in thy heart:&#8221; this is the word of&#8217; faith which we preach, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.x-p11"></A><b>9 </b>That if thou wilt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thy heart that God has raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.x-p12"></A><b>10 </b>For with the heart we believe to righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made to salvation; for the Scripture says,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.x-p13"></A><b>11 </b>&#8220;Every one who believes in him shall not be ashamed:&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.x-p14"></A><b>12 </b>For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek; for the same is the Lord of all, being rich to all who call on him;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.x-p15"></A><b>13 </b>For, &#8220;whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.x-p16"></A><b>14 </b>How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.x-p17"></A><b>15 </b>And how shall they preach except they be sent? As it is written, &#8220;How beautiful are the feet of those who proclaim peace, who proclaim good things!&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.x-p18"></A><b>16 </b>But all have not obeyed the gospel; for Isaiah says, &#8220;Who has believed our report?&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.x-p19"></A><b>17 </b>Faith then is by hearing, and hearing through the word of God.</p>

<p><a name="xxi.x-p22"></A><b>20 </b>Then Isaiah is bold and says, &#8220;I have been found by those who sought me not, I have been made manifest to those, who inquired not for me;</p>

<p><a name="xxi.xi-p10"></A><b>8 </b>As it is written, &#8220;God has given them the spirit of compunction, eyes so as not to see, and ears so as not to hear,&#8221; even to this day;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p11"></A><b>9 </b>And David says, &#8220;Be their table for a snare and for a trap, and for a stumbling, and for a recompense to them;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Darkened be their eyes so as not to see, and their back ever bow thou down.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="xxi.xi-p14"></A><b>12 </b>But if their fall be the riches of the world, and their diminution the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulness?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Even to you Gentiles do I speak, &#8212; As far, doubtless, as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles, I make illustrious my office,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p16"></A><b>14 </b>If by any means I shall provoke to emulation my flesh, and shall save some of them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p17"></A><b>15 </b>If indeed their rejection be the reconciliation of the world, what <i>will be their </i>resumption but life from the dead?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p18"></A><b>16 </b>Now if the first-fruits be holy, even so the lump; and if the root be holy, so also the branches.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p19"></A><b>17 </b>If indeed some of the branches have been broken off, and thou, a wild olive, hast been ingrafted instead of them, and hast become a partaker of the root and fatness of the olive,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p20"></A><b>18 </b>Glory not against the branches; but if thou gloriest, it is not thou who bearest the root, but the root thee.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p21"></A><b>19 </b>Thou wilt then say, &#8220;Broken off have been the branches, that I might be ingrafted.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p22"></A><b>20 </b>Be it so: for unbelief have they been broken off, and thou by faith standest; be not high-minded, but fear:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p23"></A><b>21 </b>For if God spared not the natural branches, <i>beware </i>lest he should not spare thee.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p24"></A><b>22 </b>See then the kindness and the severity of God; towards those indeed who have fallen, severity; but towards thee kindness, if thou continuest in <i>his </i>kindness; otherwise thou also shalt be cut off:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p25"></A><b>23 </b>And they, if they remain not in unbelief, shall be ingrafted; for God is able to ingraft them again.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p26"></A><b>24 </b>For if thou hast been cut off from the wild olive, which is so by nature, and hast contrary to nature been ingrafted in the true olive, much more shall they, according to nature, be ingrafted in their own olive.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p27"></A><b>25 </b>I would not indeed, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be proud among yourselves, that blindness has in part happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles shall come in:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p28"></A><b>26 </b>And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written, &#8220;Come from Sion shall the Deliverer, and shall turn away impieties from Jacob;</p>

<p><a name="xxi.xi-p31"></A><b>29 </b>For without repentance are the gifts and the calling of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xi-p32"></A><b>30 </b>As indeed ye also formerly believed not God, but have now obtained mercy through their unbelief;</p>

<p><a name="xxi.xv-p11"></A><b>9 </b>The Gentiles also ought to glorify God for his mercy, as it is written, &#8220;On this account will I confess to thee among the Gentiles, and to thy name will I sing&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p12"></A><b>10 </b>And again he says, &#8220;Exult, ye Gentiles, with his people;&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p13"></A><b>11 </b>And further, &#8220;Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles, and praise him together, all ye nations:&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p14"></A><b>12 </b>And again Isaiah says, &#8220;There shall be the root; of Jesse, and he who shall rise up to reign over the</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles hope.&#8221; And may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p16"></A><b>14 </b>But I am persuaded, my brethren, even I myself, concerning you, that ye are also yourselves full of&#8217; goodness, having been filled with all knowledge, being able to admonish one another.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p17"></A><b>15 </b>The more boldly, however, have I written to you, my brethren, in part, as putting you in mind, on account of the grace given to me by God,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p18"></A><b>16 </b>That I should be the minister of Christ to the Gentiles, consecrating the gospel of Christ, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p19"></A><b>17 </b>I have therefore reason for glorying, through Jesus Christ, in the things of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p20"></A><b>18 </b>I will not indeed dare to speak anything of those things which Christ has not done through me, as to the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and work,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p21"></A><b>19 </b>Through the power of signs and of wonders, through the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about to Illyricum,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p22"></A><b>20 </b>I have spread more fully   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_489"></A><A HREF="#fn_489"><FONT SIZE="1">490</FONT></A>
 			  the gospel of Christ; thus endeavoring to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, that I might not build on another&#8217;s foundation;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p24"></A><b>21 </b>But, as it is written, &#8220;They to whom it has not been declared concerning him, shall see; and they who have not heard, shall understand.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p25"></A><b>22 </b>I have <i>on </i>this account also been often hindered from coming to you,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p26"></A><b>23 </b>But now, having a place no longer in these regions, and having a desire for many years to come to you,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p27"></A><b>24 </b>When I go to Spain, I shall come to you. For I hope that when I go there I shall see you, and that I shall be brought on my way thither by you, if however I shall first be in part filled by a converse with you.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p28"></A><b>25 </b>But I am now going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p29"></A><b>26 </b>For it has pleased Macedonia and Achaia to make a contribution to the saints who are at Jerusalem:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p30"></A><b>27 </b>It has pleased them, I say, and their debtors they are; for if the Gentiles have partaken of their spiritual things, they ought also to minister to them in temporal things.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p31"></A><b>28 </b>When therefore I shall have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I shall go by you to Spain:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p32"></A><b>29 </b>And I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p33"></A><b>30 </b>Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive with me in your prayers for me to God,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p34"></A><b>31 </b>That I may be delivered from the unbelieving in Judea, and that my service, undertaken for Jerusalem, may be acceptable to the saints;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p35"></A>32 That with joy I may come to you by the will of God, and may, together with you, be refreshed.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxi.xv-p36"></A>33 And the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</p>  <a name="xxi.xvi"></A>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xxi.viii-p28"></A> To exhibit the meaning of this passage according to what is advanced in a note in pp. 306, 307, it shall be presented here in lines, &#8212;</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xxi.viii-p29"></A><b>19. </b>Truly the intent expectation of the creature <br> 				  Waits for the revelation of the sons of God;</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xxi.viii-p30"></A><b>20. </b>For to vanity has the creature been subjected, not willingly, <br> 				  But on his account who has subjected it in hope;</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xxi.viii-p31"></A><b>21. </b>For even the creature itself shall be freed from the bondage of corruption, <br> 				  Into the glorious liberty of the sons of God;</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xxi.viii-p32"></A><b>22. </b>For we know that every creature groans together, <br> 				  And together travails in pain to this day:&shy;</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xxi.viii-p33"></A><b>23.</b> And not only <i>they, </i>but we also ourselves, <br> 				  Who possess the first-fruit of the Spirit, <br> 				  Even we ourselves groan within ourselves, <br> 				  Anxiously waiting for <i>our </i>adoption, <br> 				  The redemption of our body;</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xxi.viii-p34"></A><b>24. </b>For in hope are we saved, <br> 				  But hope seen is not hope; <br> 				  For what one sees, why does he yet hope for it?</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xxi.viii-p35"></A><b>25. </b>But if what we see not, we hope for, <br> 				  We wait for <i>it </i>in patience.</p>  				
<p class="Footnote"><a name="xxi.viii-p36"></A>We <i>may </i>indeed consider &#8220;every creature&#8221; in verse 22 as referring to every renewed creature then living, (except the Apostles and those endowed with the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit,) and all such from the beginning of the world. In this case, &#8220;to this day&#8221; has a striking import. All God&#8217;s servants from the beginning had been groaning under the body of sin, and not only they, but even those who had enjoyed the first outpouring of the 				  Spirit, and had been endued with extraordinary gifts. The gifts of the Spirit, however abundant, did not free any from the bondage of corruption, from the body of sin; but this was an object of hope, for which they were to wait. The context, before and after, clearly shows that the present condition of God&#8217;s people is the subject. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>
