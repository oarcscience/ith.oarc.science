<p><a name="xv.i-p15"></A><a name="xv.i-p15.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p16"></A><b>1.</b><i> I say then, etc.</i> What he has hitherto said of the blindness and obstinacy of the Jews, might seem to import that Christ at his coming had transferred elsewhere the promises of God, and deprived the Jews of every hope of salvation. This objection is what he anticipates in this passage, and he so modifies what he 			 had previously said respecting the repudiation of the Jews, that no one might think that the covenant formerly made with Abraham is now abrogated, or that God had so forgotten it that the Jews were now so entirely alienated from his kingdom, as the Gentiles were before the coming of Christ. All this he denies, and he will presently show that it is altogether false. But the question is not whether God had justly or unjustly rejected the people; for it was proved in the last chapter that when the 			 people, through false zeal, had rejected the righteousness of God, they suffered a just punishment for their presumption, were deservedly blinded, and were at last cut off from the covenant.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p17"></A>The reason then for their rejection is not now under consideration; but the dispute is concerning another thing, which is this, That though they deserved such a punishment from God, whether yet the covenant which God made formerly with the fathers was abolished. That it should fail through any perfidiousness of men, was wholly unreasonable; for Paul holds this as a fixed principle, that since adoption is gratuitous and based on God alone and 			 not on men, it stands firm and inviolable, howsoever great the unfaithfulness of men may be, which may tend to abolish it. It was necessary that this knot should be untied, lest the truth and election of God should be thought to be dependent on the worthiness of men.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p18"></A><i>For I am also an Israelite, etc.</i> Before he proceeds to the subject, he proves, in passing, by his own example, how unreasonable it was to think that the nation was utterly forsaken by God; for he himself was in his origin an Israelite, not a proselyte, or one lately introduced into the commonwealth of Israel. As then he was justly deemed 			 to be one of God&#8217;s special servants, it was an evidence that God&#8217;s favor rested on Israel. He then assumes the conclusion as proved, which yet he will hereafter explain in a satisfactory manner.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p19"></A>That in addition to the title of an Israelite, he called himself the seed of Abraham, and mentioned also his own tribe; this he did that he might be counted a genuine Israelite, and he did the same in his Epistle to the Philippians, <a name="xv.i-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#004">Php 3:4</a><a name="xv.i-p19.1"></A>. But what some think, that it was done to commend God&#8217;s mercy, inasmuch as Paul sprung from that tribe which had 			 been almost destroyed, seems forced and far-fetched.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p20"></A><a name="xv.i-p20.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p21"></A><b>2.</b> <i>God has not cast away, etc.</i> This is a negative answer, accompanied with a qualifying clause; for had the Apostle unreservedly denied that the people were rejected, he would have been inconsistent with himself; but by adding a modification, he shows it to be such a rejection, as that 			 God&#8217;s promise is not thereby made void. So the answer may be divided into two parts, &#8212; that God has by no means cast away the whole race of Abraham, contrary to the tenor of his own covenant, &#8212; and that yet the fruit of adoption does not exist in all the children of the flesh, for secret election precedes. Thus general rejection could not have caused that no seed should be saved; for the visible body of the people was in such a manner rejected, that no member of the spiritual body of Christ was 			 cut off.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p22"></A>If any one asks, &#8220;Was not circumcision a common symbol of God&#8217;s favor to all the Jews, so that they ought to have been all counted his people?&#8221; To this the obvious answer is, &#8212; That as outward calling is of itself ineffectual without faith, the honor which the unbelieving refuse when offered, is justly taken from them. Thus a special people remain, in whom God exhibits an evidence of his faithfulness; and Paul derives the origin of constancy 			 from secret election. For it is not said here that God regards faith, but that he stands to his own purpose, so as not to <i>reject </i>the people whom he has foreknown.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p23"></A>And here again must be noticed what I have before reminded you of, &#8212; that by the verb<i> foreknow, </i>is not to be understood a foresight, I know not what, by which God foresees what sort of being any one will be, but that good pleasure, according to which he has chosen those as sons to himself, who, being not yet born, 			 could not have procured for themselves his favor.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_338"></A><A HREF="#fn_338"><FONT SIZE="1">339</FONT></A>
 			  So he says to the Galatians, that they had been known by God, (<a name="xv.i-p24.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009">Ga 4:9</a><a name="xv.i-p24.4"></A>); for he had anticipated them with his favor, so as to call them to the knowledge of Christ. We now perceive, that though universal calling may not bring forth fruit, yet the faithfulness of God does not fail, 			 inasmuch as he always preserves a Church, as long as there are elect remaining; for though God invites all people indiscriminately to himself, yet he does not inwardly draw any but those whom he knows to be his people, and whom he has given to his Son, and of whom also he will be the faithful keeper to the end.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p25"></A><i>Know ye not, etc.</i> As there were so few of the Jews who had believed in Christ, hardly another conclusion could have been drawn from this small number, but that the whole race of Abraham had been rejected; and creep in might this thought, &#8212; that in so vast a ruin no sign of God&#8217;s favor appeared: for since adoption was the sacred bond by 			 which the children of Abraham were kept collected under the protection of God, it was by no means probable, unless that had ceased, that the people should be miserably and wretchedly dispersed. To remove this offense, Paul adopts a most suitable example; for he relates, that in the time of Elias there was such a desolation, that there remained no appearance of a Church, and yet, that when no vestige of God&#8217;s favor appeared, the Church of God was, as it were, hid in the grave, and was thus 			 wonderfully preserved.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p26"></A>It hence follows, that they egregiously mistake who form an opinion of the Church according to their own perceptions. And surely if that celebrated Prophet, who was endued with so enlightened a mind, was so deceived, when he attempted by his own judgment to form an estimate of God&#8217;s people, what shall be the case with us, whose highest perspicuity, when compared with his, is mere dullness? Let us not then determine any thing rashly on this 			 point; but rather let this truth remain fixed in our hearts &#8212; that the Church, though it may not appear to our eyes, is sustained by the secret providence of God. Let it also be remembered by us, that they are foolish and presumptuous who calculate the number of the elect according to the extent of their own perception: for God has a way, easy to himself, hidden from us, by which he wonderfully preserves his elect, even when all things seem to us past all remedy.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p27"></A>And let readers observe this, &#8212; that Paul distinctly compares here, and elsewhere, the state of things in his time with the ancient condition of the Church, and that it serves in no small degree to confirm our faith, when we bear in mind, that nothing happens to us, at this day, which the holy Fathers had not formerly experienced: for novelty, we know, is a grievous engine to torment weak minds.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p28"></A>As to the words, <i>In Elias, </i>I have retained the expression of Paul; for it may mean either in the history or in the business of Elias; though it seems to me more probable, that Paul has followed the Hebrew mode of speaking; for <a name="xv.i-p28.1"></A>&#1489;, <i>beth, </i>which is rendered in the Greek by <a name="xv.i-p28.2"></A>&#7952;&#957;, <i>in, </i>is often taken in Hebrew for <i>of</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p29"></A><i>How he appeals to God, etc</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_339"></A><A HREF="#fn_339"><FONT SIZE="1">340</FONT></A>
 			  It was certainly a proof how much Elias honored the Lord, that for the glory of his name he hesitated not to make himself an enemy to his own nation, and to pray for their utter ruin, because he thought that the religion and worship of God had perished among them: but he was mistaken in charging the whole nation, himself alone <i>excepted, </i>with that impiety, for which he wished them to be 			 severely visited. There is however in this passage, which Paul quotes, no imprecation, but a complaint only: but as he complains in such a way as to despair of the whole people, there is no doubt but that he gave them up to destruction. Let us then especially notice what is said of Elias, which was this, &#8212; that when impiety had everywhere prevailed, and overspread almost the whole land, he thought that he was left alone.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p32"></A><i>I have reserved for myself seven thousand, etc.</i> Though you may take this finite for an indefinite number, it was yet the Lord&#8217;s design to specify a large multitude. Since then the grace of God prevails so much in an extreme state of things, let us not lightly give over to the devil all those whose piety does not openly appear to us. It 			 also ought to be fully imprinted on our minds, &#8212; that however impiety may everywhere prevail, and dreadful confusion spread on every side, yet the salvation of many remains secured under the seal of God.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_340"></A><A HREF="#fn_340"><FONT SIZE="1">341</FONT></A>
 			  But that no one may under this error indulge his own sloth, as many seek hiding-places for their vices in the hidden providences of God, it is right to observe again, &#8212; that they only are said to be saved who continue sound and unpolluted in the faith of God. This circumstance in the case ought also to be noticed, &#8212; that those only remained safe who did not prostitute their body, no, not even by an external act of dissimulation, to the 			 worship of idols; for he not only ascribes to them a purity of mind, but that they had also kept their body from being polluted by any filthiness of superstition.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_341"></A><A HREF="#fn_341"><FONT SIZE="1">342</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p35"></A><i>So then also at this time, etc.</i> He applies the example to his own age; and to make all things alike, he calls God&#8217;s people a remnant, that is, in comparison with the vast number in whom impiety prevailed: and alluding at the same time to the prophecy he had quoted from Isaiah, he shows, that in the midst of a miserable and confused 			 desolation the faithfulness of God yet shone forth, for there was still some remnant: and in order more fully to confirm this, he expressly calls them a remnant that survived through the grace of God: and thus he bore witness that God&#8217;s election is unchangeable, according to what the Lord said to Elias, &#8212; that where the whole people had fallen away to idolatry, he had reserved for himself seven thousand: and hence we conclude, that through his kindness they were delivered from destruction. Nor 			 does he simply speak of grace; but he now calls our attention also to election, that we may learn reverently to rely on the hidden purpose of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p36"></A>One thing then that is laid down is, &#8212; that few are saved in comparison with the vast number of those who assume the name of being God&#8217;s people; the other is, &#8212; that those are saved by God&#8217;s power whom he has chosen with no regard to any merit. The <i>election of grace</i> is a Hebrew idiom for gratuitous 			 election.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p37"></A><a name="xv.i-p37.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p38"></A><b>6.</b><i> If through grace, it is no more by works, etc. </i>This amplification is derived from a comparison between things of an opposite character; for such is the <i>case </i>between God&#8217;s grace and the merit of works, that he who establishes the one overturns the 			 other.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p39"></A>But if no regard to works can be admitted in election, without obscuring the gratuitous goodness of God, which he designed thereby to be so much commended to us, what answer can be given to Paul by those infatuated persons, <i>(</i><a name="xv.i-p39.1"></A><i>phrenetici</i> &#8212; <i>insane,) </i>who make the cause of election to be that worthiness in us which God has foreseen? For whether you introduce works future or 			 past, this declaration of Paul opposes you; for he says, that grace leaves nothing to works. Paul speaks not here of our reconciliation with God, nor of the means, nor of the proximate causes of our salvation; but he ascends higher, even to this, &#8212; why God, before the foundation of the world, chose only some and passed by others: and he declares, that God was led to make this difference by nothing else, but by his own good pleasure; for if any place is given to works, so much, he maintains, is 			 taken away from grace.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p40"></A>It hence follows, that it is absurd to blend foreknowledge of works with election. For if God chooses some and rejects others, as he has foreseen them to be worthy or unworthy of salvation, then the grace of God, the reward of works being established, cannot reign alone, but must be only in part the cause of our election. For as Paul has reasoned before concerning the justification of Abraham, that where reward is paid, there grace is not 			 freely bestowed; so now he draws his argument from the same fountain, &#8212; that if works come to the account, when God adopts a certain number of men unto salvation, reward is a matter of debt, and that therefore it is not a free gift.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_342"></A><A HREF="#fn_342"><FONT SIZE="1">343</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.i-p42"></A>Now, though he speaks here of election, yet as it is a general reasoning which Paul adopts, it ought to be applied to the whole of our salvation; so that we may understand, that whenever it is declared that there are no merits of works, our salvation is ascribed to the grace of God, or rather, that we may believe that the righteousness of works is annihilated, whenever grace is mentioned.</p>  <a name="xv.ii"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption19"><a name="xv.ii-p1"></A><a name="xv.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007">Romans 11:7-10</a><a name="xv.ii-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xv.ii-p2"></A><b>7.</b> What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded</p> 				   				
<p><a name="xv.ii-p3"></A><b>7.</b> Quid ergo? Quod quaerit Israel, non est assequutus;  				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_343"></A><A HREF="#fn_343"><FONT SIZE="1">344</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xv.ii-p6"></A><b>8.</b> Quemadmodum scriptum est, Dedit illis Deus spiritum compunctionis, oculos ut non videant, et aures ut non audiant, usque ad hodiernum diem.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="xv.ii-p7"></A><b>9.</b> And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:</p>

<p><a name="xv.ii-p11"></A><a name="xv.ii-p11.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.ii-p12"></A><b>7.</b> <i>What then? What Israel seeks, etc.</i> As he is here engaged on a difficult subject, he asks a question, as though he was in doubt. He intended, however, by expressing this doubt, to render the answer, which immediately follows, more evident; for he intimates, that no other can be given; 			 and the answer is, &#8212; that Israel in vain labored to seek salvation, because his attempt was absurd. Though he mentions here no cause, yet as he had expressed it before, he certainly meant it to be understood in this place. For his words are the same, as though he had said, &#8212; that it ought not to seem strange, that Israel gained nothing in striving after righteousness. And hence is proved what he presently subjoins concerning election, &#8212; For if Israel has obtained nothing by merit, what have 			 others obtained whose case or condition was not better? Whence has come so much difference between equals? Who does not here see that it is election alone which makes the difference?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.ii-p13"></A>Now the meaning of the word <i>election</i> here is doubtful; for to some it seems that it ought to be taken in a collective sense, for the elect themselves, that there may be a correspondence between the two clauses. Of this opinion I do not disapprove, provided it be allowed that there is something more in the word 			 than if he had said, the elect, even this, that he intimates that there was no other reason for obtaining their election, as though he said, &#8212; &#8220;They are not those who strive by relying on merits, but those whose salvation depends on the gratuitous election of God.&#8221; For he distinctly compares with the whole of Israel, or body of the people, the remnant which was to be saved by God&#8217;s grace. It hence follows, that the cause of salvation exists not in men, but depends on the good pleasure of God 			 alone.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.ii-p14"></A><i>And the rest have been blinded</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_344"></A><A HREF="#fn_344"><FONT SIZE="1">345</FONT></A>
 			  As the elect alone are delivered by God&#8217;s grace from destruction, so all who are not elected must necessarily remain blinded. For what Paul means with regard to the reprobate is, &#8212; that the beginning of their ruin and condemnation is from this &#8212; that they are forsaken by God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.ii-p16"></A>The quotations which he adduces, collected from various parts of Scripture, and not taken from one passage, do seem, all of them, to be foreign to his purpose, when you closely examine them according to their contexts; for you will find that in every passage, blindness and hardening are mentioned as scourges, by which God punished crimes already committed by the ungodly; but Paul labors to prove here, that not those were blinded, who so 			 deserved by their wickedness, but who were rejected by God before the foundation of the world.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.ii-p17"></A>You may thus briefly untie this knot, &#8212; that the origin of the impiety which provokes God&#8217;s displeasure, is the perversity of nature when forsaken by God. Paul therefore, while speaking of eternal reprobation, has not without reason referred to those things which proceed from it, as fruit from the tree or river from the fountain. The ungodly are indeed, for their sins, visited by God&#8217;s judgment with blindness; but if we seek for 			 the source of their ruin, we must come to this, &#8212; that being accursed by God, they cannot by all their deeds, sayings, and purposes, get and obtain any thing but a curse. Yet the cause of eternal reprobation is so hidden from us, that nothing remains for us but to wonder at the incomprehensible purpose of God, as we shall at length see by the conclusion. But they reason absurdly who, whenever a word is said of the proximate causes, strive, by bringing forward these, to cover the first, 			 which is hid from our view; as though God had not, before the fall of Adam, freely determined to do what seemed good to him with respect to the whole human race on this account, &#8212; because he condemns his corrupt and depraved seed, and also, because he repays to individuals the reward which their sins have deserved.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_345"></A><A HREF="#fn_345"><FONT SIZE="1">346</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xv.ii-p20"></A><b>8.</b> <i>Given them has God, etc.</i> There is no doubt, I think, but that the passage quoted here from Isaiah is that which Luke refers to in <a name="xv.ii-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#026">Ac 28:26</a><a name="xv.ii-p20.1"></A>, as quoted from him, only the words are 			 somewhat altered. Nor does he record here what we find in the Prophet, but only collects from him this sentiment, &#8212; that they were imbued from above with the spirit of maliciousness, so that they continued dull in seeing and hearing. The Prophet was indeed bidden to harden the heart of the people: but Paul penetrates to the very fountain, &#8212; that brutal stupor seizes on all the senses of men, after they are given up to this madness, so that they excite themselves by virulent stimulants against 			 the truth. For he does not call it the spirit of giddiness, but of compunction, when the bitterness of gall shows itself; yea, when there is also a fury in rejecting the truth. And he declares, that by the secret judgment of God the reprobate are so demented, that being stupified, they are incapable of forming a judgment; for when it is said, that by seeing they see nothing, the dullness of their senses is thereby intimated.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_346"></A><A HREF="#fn_346"><FONT SIZE="1">347</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.ii-p22"></A>Then Paul himself adds, <i>to this very day, </i>lest any one should object and say, that this prophecy had been formerly fulfilled, and that it was therefore absurd to apply it to the time of the gospel: this objection he anticipates, by subjoining, that it was not only a blindness of one day, which is <i>described, </i>but that it had continued, together with the unhealable obstinacy of the people, to the coming of Christ.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_347"></A><A HREF="#fn_347"><FONT SIZE="1">348</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xv.iii-p13"></A><b>11.</b> <i>Have they stumbled, etc.</i> You will be greatly hindered in understanding this argument, except you take notice, that the Apostle speaks sometimes of the whole nation of the Jews, and sometimes of single individuals; for hence arises the diversity, that onewhile he speaks of the Jews 			 as being banished from the kingdom of God, cut off from the tree and precipitated by God&#8217;s judgment into destruction, and that at another he denies that they had fallen from grace, but that on the contrary they continued in the possession of the covenant, and had a place in the Church of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.iii-p14"></A>It is then in conformity with this difference that he now speaks; for since the Jews for the most part rejected Christ, so that perverseness had taken hold almost on the whole nation, and few among them seemed to be of a sane mind, he asks the question, whether the Jewish nation had so stumbled at Christ, that it was all over with them universally, and that no hope of repentance remained. Here he justly denies that the salvation of the Jews 			 was to be despaired of, or that they were so rejected by God, that there was to be no future restoration, or that the covenant of grace, which he had once made with them, was entirely abolished, since there had ever remained in that nation the seed of blessing. That we are so to understand his meaning is evident from this, &#8212; that having before connected a sure ruin with blindness, he now gives a hope of rising again; which two things are wholly different. They then, who perversely stumbled at 			 Christ, fell and fell into destruction; yet the nation itself had not fallen, so that he who is a Jew must necessarily perish or be alienated from God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.iii-p15"></A><i>But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, etc. </i>The Apostle asserts two things in this place, &#8212; that the fall of the Jews had turned out for salvation to the Gentiles; but to this end &#8212; that they might be kindled by a sort of jealousy, and be thus led to repentance. He no doubt had an eye to the testimony of Moses, which he 			 had already quoted, where the Lord threatened Israel, &#8212; that as he had been provoked by them to emulation through their false gods; so he also, according to the law of retaliation, would provoke them by a foolish nation.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.iii-p16"></A>The word here used denotes the feeling of emulation or jealousy with which we are excited, when we see another preferred before us. Since then it was the Lord&#8217;s purpose that Israel should be provoked to emulation, they were not so fallen as to be precipitated into eternal ruin; but that God&#8217;s blessing, despised by them, might come to the Gentiles, in order that they might at length be also stirred up to seek the Lord, from whom they had 			 fallen away.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.iii-p17"></A>But there is no reason for readers to weary themselves much as to the application of this testimony: for Paul does not dwell on the strict meaning of the word, but alludes only to a common and well-known practice. For as emulation stimulates a wife, who for her fault has been rejected by her husband, so that she strives to be reconciled again; so it may be now, he says, that the Jews, seeing the Gentiles introduced into their place, will be 			 touched with grief for their divorce, and seek reconciliation.</p>

<p><a name="xv.iii-p19"></A><b>12.</b> <i>And if their fall, etc.</i> As he had taught us that after the Jews were repudiated, the Gentiles were introduced in their place, that he might not make the salvation of the Jews to be disliked by the Gentiles, as though their salvation depended on the ruin of the Jews, he anticipates 			 this false notion, and lays down a sentiment of an opposite kind, that nothing would conduce more to advance the salvation of the Gentiles, than that the grace of God should flourish and abound among the Jews. To prove this, he derives an argument from the less, &#8212; &#8220;If their fall had raised the Gentiles, and their diminution had enriched them, how much more their fullness?&#8221; for the first was done contrary to nature, and the last will be done according to a natural order of things. And it is no 			 objection to this reasoning, that the word of God had flowed to the Gentiles, after the Jews had rejected, and, as it were, cast it from them; for if they had received it, their faith would have brought forth much more fruit than their unbelief had occasioned; for the truth of God would have been thereby confirmed by being accomplished in them, and they also themselves would have led many by their teaching, whom they, on the contrary, by their perverseness, had turned aside.</p>

Will it not be to raise them even from the dead?&#8221; For Paul ever insists on this, that the Gentiles have no cause for envy, as though the restoration of the Jews to favor were to render their condition worse. Since then God has wonderfully drawn forth life from death and light from darkness, how much more ought we to hope, he reasons, that 			 the resurrection of a people, as it were, wholly dead, will bring life to the Gentiles.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_352"></A><A HREF="#fn_352"><FONT SIZE="1">353</FONT></A>

Let us remember that in this comparison man is not compared with man, but nation with nation. If then a comparison be made between them, they shall be found equal in this respect, that they are both equally the children of Adam; the only difference is that the Jews had been separated from the Gentiles, that they might be a peculiar people to the Lord.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_353"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">354</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.iv-p18"></A>They were then sanctified by the holy covenant, and adorned with peculiar honor, with which God had not at that time favored the Gentiles; but as the efficacy of the covenant appeared then but small, he bids us to look back to Abraham and the patriarchs, in whom the blessing of God was not indeed either empty or void. He hence concludes, that from them an heredity holiness had passed to all their posterity. But this 			 conclusion would not have been right had he spoken of persons, or rather had he not regarded the promise; for when the father is just, he cannot yet transmit his own uprightness to his son: but as the Lord had sanctified Abraham for himself for this end, that his seed might also be holy, and as he thus conferred holiness not only on his person but also on his whole race, the Apostle does not unsuitably draw this conclusion, that all the Jews were sanctified in their father Abraham.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">355</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.iv-p23"></A>Then to confirm this view, he adduces two similitudes: the one taken from the ceremonies of the law, and the other borrowed from nature. The first-fruits which were offered sanctified the whole lump, in like manner the goodness of the juice diffuses itself from the root to the branches; and posterity hold the same connection with their parents from whom they proceed as the lump has with the first-fruits, and the branches with the tree. It is 			 not then a strange thing that the Jews were sanctified in their father. There is here no difficulty if you understand by holiness the spiritual nobility of the nation, and that indeed not belonging to nature, but what proceeded from the covenant. It may be truly said, I allow, that the Jews were naturally holy, for their adoption was hereditary; but I now speak of our first nature, according to which we are all, as we know, accursed in Adam. Therefore the dignity of an elect people, to speak 			 correctly, is a supernatural privilege.</p>

<p><a name="xv.iv-p25"></A><b>17.</b> <i>And if some of the branches, etc.</i> He now refers to the present dignity of the Gentiles, which is no other than to be of the branches; which, being taken from another, are set in some noble tree: for the origin of the Gentiles was as it were from some wild and unfruitful olive, as 			 nothing but a curse was to be found in their whole race. Whatever glory then they had was from their new insition, not from their old stock. There was then no reason for the Gentiles to glory in their own dignity in comparison with the Jews. We may also add, that Paul wisely mitigates the severity of the case, by not saying that the whole top of the tree was cut off, but that some of the branches were broken, and also that God took some here and there from among the Gentiles, whom he set in the 			 holy and blessed trunk.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_355"></A><A HREF="#fn_355"><FONT SIZE="1">356</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xv.iv-p28"></A><b>18.</b> <i>But if thou gloriest, thou bearest not the root, etc.</i> The Gentiles could not contend with the Jews respecting the excellency of their race without contending with Abraham himself; which would have been extremely unbecoming, since he was like a root by which they were borne and 			 nourished. As unreasonable as it would be for the branches to boast against the root, so unreasonable would it have been for the Gentiles to glory against the Jews, that is, with respect to the excellency of their race; for Paul would have them ever to consider whence was the origin of their salvation. And we know that after Christ by his coming has pulled down the partition-wall, the whole world partook of the favor which God had previously conferred on the chosen people. It hence follows, 			 that the calling of the Gentiles was like an ingrafting, and that they did not otherwise grow up as God&#8217;s people than as they were grafted in the stock of Abraham.</p>

<p><a name="xv.iv-p30"></A><b>19.</b> <i>Thou wilt then say, etc.</i> In the person of the Gentiles he brings forward what they might have pleaded for themselves; but that was of such a nature as ought not to have filled them with pride, but, on the contrary, to have made them humble. For if the cutting off of the Jews was 			 through unbelief, and if the ingrafting of the Gentiles was by faith, what was their duty but to acknowledge the favor of God, and also to cherish modesty and humbleness of mind? For it is the nature of faith, and what properly belongs to it, to generate humility and fear.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="#fn_356"><FONT SIZE="1">357</FONT></A>
 			  But by fear understand that which is in no way inconsistent with the assurance of faith; for Paul would not have our faith to vacillate or to alternate with doubt, much less would he have us to be frightened or to quake with fear.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_357"><FONT SIZE="1">358</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.iv-p35"></A>Of what kind then is this fear? As the Lord bids us to take into our consideration two things, so two kinds of feeling must thereby be produced. For he would have us ever to bear in mind the miserable condition of our nature; and this can produce nothing but dread, weariness, anxiety, and despair; and it is indeed expedient that we should thus be thoroughly laid prostrate and broken down, that we may at length groan to him; but this dread, 			 derived from the knowledge of ourselves, keeps not our minds while relying on his goodness, from continuing calm; this weariness hinders us not from enjoying full consolation in him; this anxiety, this despair, does not prevent us from obtaining in him real joy and hope. Hence the fear, of which he speaks, is set up as an antidote to proud contempt; for as every one claims for himself more than what is right, and becomes too secure and at length insolent towards others, we ought then so far to 			 fear, that our heart may not swell with pride and elate itself.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.iv-p36"></A>But it seems that he throws in a doubt as to salvation, since he reminds them to beware lest they also should not be spared. To this I answer, &#8212; that as this exhortation refers to the subduing of the flesh, which is ever insolent even in the children of God, he derogates nothing from the certainty of faith. And we must especially notice and remember what I have before said, &#8212; that Paul&#8217;s address is not so much to individuals as to the whole 			 body of the Gentiles, among whom there might have been many, who were vainly inflated, professing rather than having faith. On account of these Paul threatens the Gentiles, not without reason, with excision, as we shall hereafter find again.</p>

<p><a name="xv.iv-p38"></A><b>21.</b> <i>For if God has not spared the natural branches, etc. </i>This is a most powerful reason to beat down all self-confidence: for the rejection of the Jews should never come across our minds without striking and shaking us with dread.

They were not spared, though they were natural branches; what then shall be done to us, who are the wild olive and aliens, if we become beyond measure arrogant? But this thought, as it leads us to distrust ourselves, so it tends to make us to cleave more firmly and steadfastly to the goodness of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.iv-p39"></A>And here again it appears more evident, that the discourse is addressed generally to the body of the Gentiles, for the excision, of which he speaks, could not apply to individuals, whose election is unchangeable, based on the eternal purpose of God.

It is indeed true that each individual among the Jews received the reward due to his own unbelief, when they were banished from the kingdom of God, and that all who front among the Gentiles were called, were vessels of God&#8217;s mercy; but yet the particular design of Paul must be borne in mind. For he would 			 have the Gentiles to depend on the eternal covenant of God, so as to connect their own with the salvation of the elect people, and then, lest the rejection of the Jews should produce offense, as though their ancient adoption were void, he would have them to be terrified by this example of punishment, so as reverently to regard the judgment of God. For whence comes so great licentiousness on curious questions, except that we almost neglect to consider those things which ought to have duly 			 taught us humility?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.v-p13"></A>But as he speaks not of the elect individually, but of the whole body, a condition is added, <i>If they continued in his kindness</i> I indeed allow, that as soon as any one abuses God&#8217;s goodness, he deserves to be deprived of the offered favor; but it would be improper to say of any one of the godly particularly, that 			 God had mercy on him, when he chose him, provided he would continue in his mercy; for the perseverance of faith, which completes in us the effect of God&#8217;s grace, flows from election itself. Paul then teaches us, that the Gentiles were admitted into the hope of eternal life on the condition, that they by their gratitude retained possession of it. And dreadful indeed was the defection of the whole world, which afterwards happened; and this dearly proves, that this exhortation was not superfluous; 			 for when God had almost in a moment watered it with his grace, so that religion flourished everywhere, soon after the truth of the gospel vanished, and the treasure of salvation was taken away. And whence came so sudden a change, except that the Gentiles had fallen away from their calling?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.v-p14"></A><i>Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off, etc.</i> We now understand in what sense Paul threatens them with excision, whom he has already allowed to have been grafted into the hope of life through God&#8217;s election. For, first, though this cannot happen to the elect, they have yet need of such warning, in order to subdue the pride of the flesh; which 			 being really opposed to their salvation, ought justly to be terrified with the dread of perdition. As far then as Christians are illuminated by faith, they hear, for their assurance, that the calling of God is without repentance; but as far as they carry about them the flesh, which wantonly resists the grace of God, they are taught humility by this warning, &#8220;Take heed lest thou be cut off.&#8221; Secondly, we must bear in mind the solution which I 			 have before mentioned, &#8212; that Paul speaks not here of the special election of individuals, but sets the Gentiles and Jews in opposition the one to the other; and that therefore the elect are not so much addressed in these words, as those who falsely gloried that they had obtained the place of the Jews: nay, he speaks to the Gentiles generally, and addresses the whole body in common, among whom there were many who were faithful, and those who were members of Christ in name only.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.v-p15"></A>But if it be asked respecting individuals, &#8220;How any one could be cut off from the grafting, and how, after excision, he could be grafted again,&#8221; &#8212; bear in mind, that there are three modes of insition, and two modes of excision. For instance, the children of the faithful are ingrafted, to whom the promise belongs according to the covenant made with the fathers; ingrafted are also they who indeed receive the seed of the gospel, but it 			 strikes no root, or it is choked before it brings any fruit; and thirdly, the elect are ingrafted, who are illuminated unto eternal life according to the immutable purpose of God. The first are cut off, when they refuse the promise given to their fathers, or do not receive it on account of their ingratitude; the second are cut off, when the seed is withered and destroyed; and as the danger of this impends over all, with regard to their own nature, it must be allowed that this warning which Paul 			 gives belongs in a certain way to the faithful, lest they indulge themselves in the sloth of the flesh. But with regard to the present passage, it is enough for us to know, that the vengeance which God had executed on the Jews, is pronounced on the Gentiles, in case they become like them.</p>

<p><a name="xv.v-p17"></A><b>23.</b><i> For God is able, etc</i>. Frigid would this argument be to the profane; for however they may concede power to God, yet as they view it at a distance, shut up as it were in heaven, they do for the most part rob it of its effect. But as the faithful, whenever they hear God&#8217;s power named, look on it as in present 			 operation, he thought that this reason was sufficient to strike their minds. We may add, that he assumes this as an acknowledged axiom, &#8212; that God had so punished the unbelief of his people as not to forget his mercy; according to what he had done before, having often restored the Jews, after he had apparently banished them from his kingdom. And he shows at the same time by the comparison, how much more easy it would be to reverse the present state of things than to have introduced it; that is, 			 how much easier it would be for the natural branches, if they were again put in the place from which they had been cut off, to draw substance from their own root, than for the wild and the unfruitful, from a foreign stock: for such is the comparison made between the Jews and the Gentiles.</p>  <a name="xv.vi"></A>

This admonition was also necessary, lest the defection of that people should immoderately disturb the minds of the weak, as though the salvation of them all was to be forever despaired of. The same is still not less useful to us at this day, so that we may know, that the salvation of the remnant, whom the Lord will 			 at length gather to himself, is hid, sealed as it were by his signet. And whenever a long delay tempts us to despair, let us remember this word <i>mystery; </i>by which Paul clearly reminds us, that the mode of their conversion will neither be common nor usual; and hence they act absurdly who attempt to measure it by their own judgment; for what can be more unreasonable than to regard that as incredible which is far removed from our view?

And 			 so this blindness served the providence of God in furthering the salvation of the Gentiles, which he had designed. And the <i>fullness of the Gentiles</i> is to be taken for a great number: for it was not to be, as before, when a few proselytes connected themselves with the Jews; but such was to be the change, that the Gentiles would form almost the entire body of the Church.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_362"></A><A HREF="#fn_362"><FONT SIZE="1">363</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xv.vi-p18"></A><b>26.</b> <i>And so all Israel, etc. </i>Many understand this of the Jewish people, as though Paul had said, that religion would again be restored among them as before: but I extend the word <i>Israel</i> to all the people of God, according to this meaning, &#8212; &#8220;When the Gentiles shall come in, the Jews also shall return from their defection to the obedience of faith; and thus shall be completed the salvation of the whole Israel of God, which must be gathered from both; and yet in such a way that the Jews shall obtain the first place, being as it were the first-born in God&#8217;s family.&#8221; This interpretation seems to me the most suitable, because Paul intended here to set forth the completion of the kingdom of Christ, which is by no means to be confined to the Jews, but is to include the whole world. The same manner of speaking we find in <a name="xv.vi-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016">Ga 6:16</a><a name="xv.vi-p18.1"></A>. The Israel of God is what he calls the Church, gathered 			 alike from Jews and Gentiles; and he sets the people, thus collected from their dispersion, in opposition to the carnal children of Abraham, who had departed from his faith.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.vi-p19"></A><i>As it is written, etc.</i> He does not confirm the whole passage by this testimony of Isaiah, (<a name="xv.vi-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020">Isa 59:20</a><a name="xv.vi-p19.1"></A>,) but only one clause, &#8212; that the children of Abraham shall be partakers of redemption. But if one takes this view, &#8212; that 			 Christ had been promised and offered to them, but that as they rejected him, they were deprived of his grace; yet the Prophet&#8217;s words express more, even this, &#8212; that there will be some remnant, who, having repented, shall enjoy the favor of deliverance.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.vi-p20"></A>Paul, however, does not quote what we read in Isaiah, word for word;</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xv.vi-p21"></A>&#8220;come,&#8221; he says, &#8220;shall a Redeemer to Sion, and to those who shall repent of iniquity in Jacob, saith the Lord.&#8221; (<a name="xv.vi-p21.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020">Isa 59:20</a><a name="xv.vi-p21.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.vi-p22"></A>But on this point we need not be very curious; only this is to be regarded, that the Apostles suitably apply to their purpose whatever proofs they adduce from the Old Testament; for their object was to point but passages, as it were by the finger, that readers might be directed to the fountain itself.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.vi-p23"></A>But though in this prophecy deliverance to the spiritual people of God is promised, among whom even Gentiles are included; yet as the Jews are the first-born, what the Prophet declares must be fulfilled, especially in them: for that Scripture calls all the people of God Israelites, is to be ascribed to the pre-eminence of that nation, whom God had preferred to all other nations. And then, from a regard to the ancient covenant, he says 			 expressly, that a Redeemer shall come to Sion; and he adds, that he will redeem those in Jacob who shall return from their transgression.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_363"></A><A HREF="#fn_363"><FONT SIZE="1">364</FONT></A>
 			 By these words God distinctly claims for himself a certain seed, so that his redemption may be effectual in his elect and peculiar nation. And though fitter for his purpose would have been the expression used by the Prophet, &#8220;shall come to Sion;&#8221; yet Paul made no scruple to follow the commonly received translation, which reads, &#8220;The Redeemer shall come forth from Mount Sion.&#8221; And similar is the case as to the second part, &#8220;He shall turn away iniquities from Jacob:&#8221; for 			 Paul thought it enough to regard this point only, &#8212; that as it is Christ&#8217;s peculiar office to reconcile to God an apostate and faithless people, some change was surely to be looked for, lest they should all perish together.</p>

<p><a name="xv.vi-p28"></A><b>27.</b> <i>And, this is my covenant with them, etc.</i> Though Paul, by the last prophecy of Isaiah, briefly touched on the office of the Messiah, in order to remind the Jews what was to be expected especially from him, he further adds these few words from Jeremiah, expressly for the same purpose; 			 for what is added is not found in the former passage.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_364"></A><A HREF="#fn_364"><FONT SIZE="1">365</FONT></A>
 			  This also tends to confirm the subject in hand; for what he said of the conversion of a people who were so stubborn and obstinate, might have appeared incredible: he therefore removes this stumblingblock, by declaring that the covenant included a gratuitous remission of sins. For we may gather from the words of the Prophet, &#8212; that God would have no more to do with his apostate people, until he should remit the crime of perfidy, as well as 			 their other sins.</p>  <a name="xv.vii"></A>

 			  and that still they were not for ever excluded from the favor of God. He then admits, that they were for the present alienated from God on account of the gospel, that thus the salvation, which at first was deposited with them, might come to the Gentiles; and yet that God was not unmindful of the covenant which he had made with their fathers, and by which he testified that according to his eternal purpose he loved that nation: and this he 			 confirms by this remarkable declaration, &#8212; that the grace of the divine calling cannot be made void; for this is the import of the words, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.vii-p17"></A><a name="xv.vii-p17.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.vii-p18"></A><b>29.</b> <i>The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</i> He has mentioned gifts and calling; which are to be understood, according to a figure in grammar,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_368"></A><A HREF="#fn_368"><FONT SIZE="1">369</FONT></A>
 			  as meaning the gift of calling: and this is not to be taken for any sort of calling but of that, by which God had adopted the posterity of Abraham into covenant; since this is especially the subject here, as he has previously, by the word, election, designated the secret purpose of God, by which he had formerly made a distinction between the Jews and the Gentiles.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_369"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">370</FONT></A>
 			  For we must bear this in mind, &#8212; that he speaks not now of the election of individuals, but of the common adoption of the whole nation, which might seem for a time, according to the outward appearance, to have failed, but had not been cut up by the roots. As the Jews had fallen from their privilege and the salvation promised them, that some hope might remain to the remnant, Paul maintains that the purpose of God stands firm and immovable, by 			 which he had once deigned to choose them for himself as a peculiar nation.

<p><a name="xv.vii-p24"></A>it is evident that he has not wholly turned away his kindness from the Jewish nation.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.vii-p25"></A>He does not oppose the gospel to election, as though they were contrary the one to the other, for whom God has chosen he calls; but inasmuch as the gospel had been proclaimed to the Gentiles beyond the expectation of the world, he justly compares this favor with the ancient election of the Jews, which had been manifested so many ages before: and so election derives its name from antiquity; for God had in past ages of the world chosen one 			 people for himself.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.vii-p26"></A><i>On account of the Fathers,</i> he says not, because they gave any cause for love, but because God&#8217;s favor had descended from them to their posterity, according to the tenor of the covenant, &#8220;Thy God and the God of thy seed.&#8221; How the Gentiles had obtained mercy through the unbelief of the 			 Jews, has been before stated, namely, that God, being angry with the Jews for their unbelief, turned his kindness to them. What immediately follows, that they became unbelievers through the mercy manifested to the Gentiles, seems rather strange; and yet there is in it nothing unreasonable; for Paul assigns not the cause of blindness, but only declares, that what God transferred to the Gentiles had been taken away from the Jews. But lest what they had lost through unbelief, should be thought by 			 the Gentiles to have been gained by them through the merit of faith, mention is made only of mercy. What is substantially said then is, &#8212; that as God purposed to show mercy to the Gentiles, the Jews were on this account deprived of the light of faith.</p>

<p><a name="xv.vii-p28"></A><b>32.</b> <i>For God has shut up, etc.</i> A remarkable conclusion, by which he shows that there is no reason why they who have a hope of salvation should despair of others; for whatever they may now be, they have been like all the rest. If they have emerged from unbelief through God&#8217;s mercy alone, 			 they ought to leave place for it as to others also. For he makes the Jews equal in guilt with the Gentiles, that both might understand that the avenue to salvation is no less open to others than to them. For it is the mercy of God alone which saves; and this offers itself to both. This sentence then corresponds with the testimony of Hosea, which he had before quoted, &#8220;I will call those my people who were not my people.&#8221; But he does not mean, 			 that God so blinds all men that their unbelief is to be imputed to him; but that he hath so arranged by his providence, that all should be guilty of unbelief, in order that he might have them subject to his judgment, and for this end, &#8212; that all merits being buried, salvation might proceed from his goodness alone.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_370"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">371</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xv.vii-p31"></A>Paul then intends here to teach two things &#8212; that there is nothing in any man why he should be preferred to others, apart from the mere favor of God; and that God in the dispensation of his grace, is under no restraint that he should not grant it to whom he pleases. There is an emphasis in the word <i>mercy; </i>for 			 it intimates that God is bound to none, and that he therefore saves all freely, for they are all equally lost. But extremely gross is their folly who hence conclude that all shall be saved; for Paul simply means that both Jews and Gentiles do not otherwise obtain salvation than through the mercy of God, and thus he leaves to none any reason for complaint. It is indeed true that this mercy is 			 without any difference offered to all, but every one must seek it by faith.</p>  <a name="xv.viii"></A>

Whenever then we enter on a discourse respecting the eternal counsels of God, let a bridle be always set on our thoughts and tongue, so that after having spoken soberly and within the limits of God&#8217;s word, our reasoning may at last end in admiration. Nor ought we to be ashamed, that if we are not wiser than he, who, having been taken into the third heaven, saw mysteries to man ineffable, and who yet could find in this instance no other end designed but that he should thus humble 			 himself.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.viii-p14"></A>Some render the words of Paul thus, &#8220;Oh! the deep riches, and wisdom, and knowledge of God!&#8221; as though the word <a name="xv.viii-p14.1"></A>&#946;&#8049;&#952;&#959;&#962; was an adjective; and they take <i>riches</i> for abundance, but this seems to me strained, and I 			 have therefore no doubt but that he extols God&#8217;s deep riches of wisdom and knowledge.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_373"></A><A HREF="#fn_373"><FONT SIZE="1">374</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xv.viii-p22"></A><i>How incomprehensible, etc.</i> By different words, according to a practice common in Hebrew, he expresses the same thing. For he speaks of <i>judgments, </i>then he subjoins <i>ways, </i>which mean appointments or the mode of acting, or the manner of ruling. But he still continues his exclamation, and thus the more he elevates the height of the divine mystery, the more he deters us from the curiosity of investigating it. Let us then learn to make no searchings respecting the Lord, except as far as he has revealed himself in the Scriptures; for otherwise we shall enter a labyrinth, from which the 			 retreat is not easy. It must however be noticed, that he speaks not here of all God&#8217;s mysteries, but of those which are hid with God himself, and ought to be only admired and adored by us.</p>

<p><a name="xv.viii-p24"></A><b>34.</b><i> Who has known the mind of the Lord?</i> He begins here to extend as it were his hand to restrain the audacity of men, lest they should clamor against God&#8217;s judgments, and this he does by stating two reasons: the first is, that all mortals are too blind to take a view of God&#8217;s predestination by their own 			 understanding, and to reason on a thing unknown is presumptuous and absurd; the other is, that we can have no cause of complaint against God, since no mortal can boast that God is a debtor to him; but that, on the contrary, all are under obligations to him for his bounty.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_374"></A><A HREF="#fn_374"><FONT SIZE="1">375</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.viii-p28"></A>Within this limit then let every one remember to keep his own mind, lest he be carried beyond God&#8217;s oracles in investigating predestination, since we hear that man can distinguish nothing in this case, any more than a blind man in darkness. This caution, however, is not to be so applied as to weaken the certainty of faith, which proceeds not from the acumen of the human mind, but solely from the illumination of the Spirit; for Paul himself 			 in another place, after having testified that all the mysteries of God far exceed the comprehension of our minds, immediately subjoins that the faithful understand the mind of the Lord, because they have not received the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which has been given them by God, by whom they are instructed as to his goodness, which otherwise would be incomprehensible to them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.viii-p29"></A>As then we cannot by our own faculties examine the secrets of God, so we are admitted into a certain and clear knowledge of them by the grace of the Holy Spirit: and if we ought to follow the guidance of the Spirit, where he leaves us, there we ought to stop and as it were to fix our standing. If any one will seek to know more than what God has revealed, he shall be overwhelmed with the immeasurable brightness of inaccessible light. But we 			 must bear in mind the distinction, which I have before mentioned, between the secret counsel of God, and his will made known in Scripture; for though the whole doctrine of Scripture surpasses in its height the mind of man, yet an access to it is not closed against the faithful, who reverently and soberly follow the Spirit as their guide; but the case is different with regard to his hidden counsel, the depth and height of which cannot by any investigation be reached.</p>

<p><a name="xv.viii-p31"></A><b>35.</b> <i>Who has first given to him, etc.</i> Another reason, by which God&#8217;s righteousness is most effectually defended against all the accusations of the ungodly: for if no one retains him bound to himself by his own merits, no one can justly expostulate with him for not having received his 			 reward; as he, who would constrain another to do him good, must necessarily adduce those deeds by which he has deserved a reward. The import then of Paul&#8217;s words is this &#8212; &#8220;God cannot be charged with unrighteousness, except it can be proved, that he renders not to every one his due: but it is evident, that no one is deprived by him of his right, since he is under obligation to none; for who can boast of any thing of his own, by which he has deserved his favor?&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_375"></A><A HREF="#fn_375"><FONT SIZE="1">376</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xv.viii-p36"></A>Now this is a remarkable passage; for we are here taught, that it is not in our power to constrain God by our good works to bestow salvation on us, but that he anticipates the undeserving by his gratuitous goodness. But if we desire to make an honest examination, we shall not only find, that God is in no way a debtor to us, but that we are all subject to his judgment, &#8212; that we not only deserve no layout, but that we are worthy of eternal 			 death. And Paul not only concludes, that God owes us nothing, on account of our corrupt and sinful nature; but he denies, that if man were perfect, he could bring anything before God, by which he could gain his favor; for as soon as he begins to exist, he is already by the right of creation so much indebted to his Maker, that he has nothing of his own. In vain then shall we try to take from him his own right, that he should not, as he pleases, freely determine respecting his own creatures, as 			 though there was mutual debt and credit.</p>

<p><a name="xv.viii-p38"></A><b>36.</b> <i>For from him and through him, etc.</i> A confirmation of the last verse. He shows, that it is very far from being the case, that we can glory in any good thing of our own against God, since we have been created by him from nothing, and 			 now exist through him. He hence infers, that our being should be employed for his glory: for how unreasonable would it be for creatures, whom he has formed and whom he sustains, to live for any other purpose than for making his glory known? It has not escaped my notice, that the phrase, <a name="xv.viii-p38.1"></A>&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;, <i>to him, </i>is sometimes taken for <a name="xv.viii-p38.2"></A>&#7952;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;<i>, in </i>or<i> by him, </i>but improperly: and as its proper meaning is more suitable to the present subject, it is better to retain it, than to adopt that which is improper. The import of what is said is, &#8212; That the whole order of nature would be strangely subverted, were not God, who is the beginning of all things, the end also.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xv.viii-p39"></A><i>To him be glory, etc. </i>The proposition being as it were proved, he now confidently assumes it as indubitable, &#8212; That the Lord&#8217;s own glory ought everywhere to continue to him unchangeably: for the sentence would be frigid were it taken generally; but its emphasis depends on the context, that. God justly claims for himself absolute 			 supremacy, and that in the condition of mankind and of the whole world nothing is to be sought beyond his own glory. It hence follows, that absurd and contrary to reason, and even insane, are all those sentiments which tend to diminish his glory.</p>

<p class="Super"><a name="xv.i-p24"></A> That foreknowledge here includes election or predestination, as <a name="xv.i-p24.1"></A>Augustine maintains, is evident from what follows in <a name="xv.i-p24.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005">Ro 11:5</a><a name="xv.i-p24.2"></A>, where &#8220;the remnant&#8221; is said to be reserved &#8220;according to the election of grace,&#8221; or gratuitous election.

Were it otherwise, were foreseen works the ground of election, there would be no suitableness nor congruity in such terms as foreknowledge and election on the subject. It would have been much more appropriate in this case for the Apostle to say, &#8220;God will receive every Jew who will render himself worthy by his works.&#8221; On this supposition there was no necessity for him to go back to election to remove 				  the objection which he had stated; he had only to refer to the terms of the gospel, which regard Jews and Gentiles without any difference. But instead of doing this, which <i>seems</i> adequate to the purpose, he gives an answer by referring to the foreknowledge and free election of God. There is no way to account for this, except by admitting, that election is an efficacious purpose which secures the salvation of those who are its objects, who have been chosen in Christ before the foundation 				  of the world. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

The hardening or blinding spoken of by the Prophets, is stated uniformly as a punishment for previous unbelief and impenitence, as admitted by our author 				  himself, and the obvious fact as to the Jews in the Apostle&#8217;s days, was an evidence of the same, and though he states not this fact here, he states it in the sequel of this Epistle. But why some were hardened, and others were softened, is what must be resolved altogether to the will of God.

<p class="Super"><a name="xv.iv-p20"></A><a name="xv.iv-p20.1"></A>Pareus makes a distinction between what passes from progenitors to their offspring and what does not pass.

<p class="Super"><a name="xv.iv-p21"></A>&#8220;The holiness,&#8221; says <a name="xv.iv-p21.1"></A>Turrettin, &#8220;of the first-fruits and of the root was no other than an external, federal, and national consecration, such as could be transferred from parents to their children.&#8221;</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xv.iv-p22"></A>&#8220;The attentive reader,&#8221; says <a name="xv.iv-p22.1"></A>Scott, &#8220;will readily perceive that <i>relative</i> holiness, or consecration to God, is here exclusively meant. [...] Abraham was as it were the root of the visible Church. Ishmael was broken off, and the tree grew up in Isaac; and when Esau was broken off, it grew up in Jacob and his sons. [...] When the nation rejected the Messiah, their relation to Abraham and to God was as it were 				  suspended.

It has been said, that it was not the practice to graft a wild olive in a good olive, except when the 				  latter was decaying, such may have been the case; but the Apostle&#8217;s object was no so much to refer to what was usual, as to form a comparison suitable to his purpose; and this is what our Savior in his parables had sometimes done. Contrary to what the case is in nature, the Apostle makes the stock good and the graft bad, and makes the stock to communicate its goodness to the graft and to improve the quality of its fruit. But his main object is to show the fact of incision, without any regard to 				  the character of the stock and of the graft in natural things; for both <i>his</i> stock and <i>his </i>graft are of a different character. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

<p class="Super"><a name="xv.vi-p13"></A> The explanation of this verse is by no means satisfactory. It does not Correspond at all with what the Apostle has already declared in <a name="xv.vi-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011">Rom. 11:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#000">Rom. 12:0</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#000">Rom. 15:0</a><a name="xv.vi-p13.1"></A>; where the restoration of the Jews to the faith is most clearly set forth. Besides, by making Israel, in the next verse, to mean generally the people of God, the 				  contrast, observable through the whole argument, is completely destroyed.</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xv.vi-p14"></A>The word for &#8220;blindness&#8221; is &#960;&#8061;&#961;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;, hardness, callousness, and hence contumacy. &#8220;In part,&#8221; is generally regarded as having reference both to extent and duration: the hardness did not extend to all the Jews, and it was not to endure, but to continue for a time; and the time is mentioned, &#8220;until the fullness of the Gentiles come in.&#8221; This is obviously the meaning, and confirmed by 				  the whole context. The attempt of <a name="xv.vi-p14.1"></A>Grotius and <a name="xv.vi-p14.2"></A>Hammond, and of some of the Fathers, to confine what is said to the Apostolic times, is wholly irreconcilable with the drift of the whole passage and with facts.</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xv.vi-p15"></A>Much as been written on the words, &#7940;&#967;&#961;&#953;&#962; &#959;&#8022; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#955;&#8053;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#945; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#952;&#957;&#8182;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#8051;&#955;&#952;&#8031;. That the event was future in the Apostle&#8217;s time, (and future still as history proves) is evident, especially from the following verse, &#8220;and so all Israel shall be saved.&#8221; The plain construction of the passage is, &#8220;until the fullness of the Gentiles shall come.&#8221; What this &#8220;fullness&#8221; is to be has been much 				  controverted. But by taking a view of the whole context, without regard to any hypothesis, we shall, with no great difficulty, ascertain its meaning. The &#8220;fullness&#8221; of the Jews in <a name="xv.vi-p15.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012">Ro 11:12</a><a name="xv.vi-p15.1"></A>, is determined by <a name="xv.vi-p15.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026">Ro 11:26</a><a name="xv.vi-p15.2"></A>; it includes the whole nation. Then the &#8220;fullness of the 				  Gentiles&#8221; must mean the same thing, the introduction of all nations into the Church. The grafting more particularly signifies profession. It then follows that all nations shall be brought publicly to profess the gospel prior to the removal of the hardness from the whole nation of the Jews. There may be isolated cases of conversion before this event, for &#8220;in part&#8221; as to extent the hardness is to be: but all shall not be brought to the faith, until the faith spread through the whole world: and 				  the effect of their restoration will be a great revival of vital religion among the professing Gentiles, according to what is said in <a name="xv.vi-p15.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015">Ro 11:15</a><a name="xv.vi-p15.3"></A>. This is clearly the view presented to us in this extraordinary passage, when all its parts are compared with each other.</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xv.vi-p16"></A><a name="xv.vi-p16.1"></A>Hammond tells us, that many of the Fathers wholly denied the future restoration of the Jews, and we are told by <a name="xv.vi-p16.2"></A>Pareus<i>, </i>who mentions some of the same Fathers, that they maintained it. But it appears from the quotations made by the first, that the restoration disallowed was that to their own land, and that the restoration referred to by the latter was restoration to the 				  faith; two things wholly distinct. That &#8220;Israel&#8221; means exclusively the Jewish nation, was almost the unanimous opinion of the Fathers, according to <a name="xv.vi-p16.3"></A>Estius; and that their future restoration to the faith is here foretold was the sentiment held by <a name="xv.vi-p16.4"></A>Beza, <a name="xv.vi-p16.5"></A>Pareus, <i>Willet</i>, <a name="xv.vi-p16.6"></A>Mede, and others, and is generally held by modern divines. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

<p class="Super"><a name="xv.vi-p24"></A> There is more discrepancy in this reference than any we have met with. The Apostle follows not literally either the Hebrew or the Septuagint, though the latter more than the former. In the Hebrew, it is, &#8220;to Sion,&#8221; <a name="xv.vi-p24.1"></A>&#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, and in the Septuagint, &#8220;for the sake of Sion,&#8221; &#7957;&#957;&#949;&#954;&#949;&#957; &#931;&#953;&#8061;&#957;. Then the following clause is given verbatim from the <i>Septuagint</i>, and differs materially from the Hebrew, at least as translated in our version. The Syriac and Chaldee give the verb a causative meaning, so as to make the sense the same as here. But it may be regarded as an infinitive with a pargogic <a name="xv.vi-p24.2"></A>&#1497;, and in a transitive sense, 				  which it sometimes has. See <a name="xv.vi-p24.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#016">1Ki 2:16</a><a name="xv.vi-p24.3"></A>; <a name="xv.vi-p24.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#010">Ps 132:10</a><a name="xv.vi-p24.4"></A>. If so, the verse will agree with the Apostle&#8217;s words, and may be thus rendered, &#8212;</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xv.vi-p25"></A>Come to Sion shall a deliverer,<br> 				  And to turn away the ungodliness <i>that is</i> in Jacob.</p>

But if we do this, then &#960;&#955;&#959;&#8059;&#964;&#959;&#965; means &#8220;treasures, or blessings,&#8221; or <a name="xv.viii-p17.5"></A>copia beneficiorum,&#8221; as <a name="xv.viii-p17.6"></A>Schleusner expresses it. &#8220;Riches of Christ&#8221; mean the abounding blessings laid up in him, <a name="xv.viii-p17.7"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008">Eph 3:8</a><a name="xv.viii-p17.7"></A>. God may be viewed as set forth here as the source of all things, and as infinite in wisdom and knowledge; and these <i>three </i>things are the subjects to the end of the chapter, the two last verses referring to the first, and the end of the thirty-third and the thirty-fourth to the two others, and in an inverted order. The depth or vastness of his wealth or bounty is such, that he has nothing but his own, no one having given him anything, (<a name="xv.viii-p17.8"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#035">Ro 11:35</a><a name="xv.viii-p17.8"></A>,) and from him, 				  and through him, and to him are all things, (<a name="xv.viii-p17.9"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036">Ro 11:36</a><a name="xv.viii-p17.9"></A>.) Then as to the vastness of his wisdom and of his knowledge; what his knowledge has decided cannot be searched out, and what his wisdom has devised, as to the manner of executing his purposes, cannot be investigated; and no one can measure the extent of his knowledge, and no one has been his counselor, so as to add to the 				  stores of his wisdom, (<a name="xv.viii-p17.10"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#034">Ro 11:34</a><a name="xv.viii-p17.10"></A>.) That we may see the whole passage in lines &#8212;</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xv.viii-p18"></A><b>33.</b> Oh the depth of God&#8217;s bounty and wisdom and knowledge!<br> 				  How inscrutable his judgments<br> 				  And untraceable his ways!</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xv.viii-p19"></A><b>34.</b> Who indeed hath known the Lord&#8217;s mind,<br> 				  Or who has become his counselor?</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xv.viii-p20"></A><b>35.</b> Or who has first given to him?<br> 				  And it shall be repayed to him:</p>

<p class="Super"><a name="xv.viii-p25"></A> The words of this verse seem to have been taken literally from <a name="xv.viii-p25.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#013">Isa 40:13</a><a name="xv.viii-p25.1"></A>, as given in the <i>Septuagint</i>. The Hebrew is in some measure different, but the words will admit of a rendering approaching nearer to the meaning here than what is presented in our version, as follows &#8212;</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xv.viii-p26"></A>Who has weighed the spirit of Jehovah,<br> 				  And, <i>being</i> a man of his counsel, has taught him?</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xv.viii-p27"></A>To &#8220;weigh the spirit&#8221; is to know it thoroughly: the same verb, <a name="xv.viii-p27.1"></A>&#1514;&#1499;&#1503;, is used in this sense in <a name="xv.viii-p27.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#002">Pr 16:2</a><a name="xv.viii-p27.2"></A>; <a name="xv.viii-p27.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#012">Pr 24:12</a><a name="xv.viii-p27.3"></A>. It indeed means to compute by measure or by weight; so that it may be rendered &#8220;measure&#8221; as well as &#8220;weigh,&#8221; and if we adopt &#8220;measure,&#8221; it will then appear that to &#8220;know the mind of the Lord,&#8221; is to know the <i>extent</i> of his understanding or knowledge; an idea which remarkably corresponds with the passage. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

<p class="Super"><a name="xv.viii-p32"></A> There is a passage in <a name="xv.viii-p32.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#011">Job 41:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#012">12</a><a name="xv.viii-p32.1"></A>, (in the Hebrew Bible,) of which this verse seems to be a translation, made by the Apostle himself, as totally another meaning is given in the <i>Septuagint</i>. The person is alone changed. The Hebrew is literally this,</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xv.viii-p33"></A>Who has anticipated me,<br> 				  And I will repay?</p>  				
<p class="Super"><a name="xv.viii-p34"></A>To &#8220;anticipate&#8221; means here with favor or gift; for the remainder of the verse is the following, &#8212;</p>
