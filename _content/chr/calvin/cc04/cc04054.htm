<p><a name="iii.iii.xi-p37"></A><b>5.</b> <i>Take ye from among you an offering.</i> I have introduced a passage from chapter 35, wherein Moses again requires what he had before prescribed; but he goes more into detail, and treats at greater length of the parts of the tabernacle. In the former 				passage he employed a verb, where he here uses a noun, &#8220;willing or voluntary of heart.&#8221; There is, however, no ambiguity in the meaning; since in both places God requires a cheerful zeal, so that they may not only contribute abundantly, but willingly. He will afterwards use a different form of expression, viz., that <i>they </i>did their duty, whose heart roused, or stirred them up, so as to distinguish them from the indifferent and slow. &#8212; 				5:21.</p>

<p><a name="iii.iii.xi-p39"></A><b>10.</b> <i>And every wise-hearted among you.</i> Thus he denominates the artificers, who excelled in shrewdness of intellect, and so, after having commanded them severally of their private means to supply the materials, he now exhorts others to contribute their industry for shaping and 				joining them together. He then briefly enumerates the parts of the Tabernacle, a longer explanation of which will be seen in chapter 26. This is, therefore, a kind of epitome of all those things, of which he before spoke more in full, since it was necessary to spur them on afresh to the performance of what they had been clearly instructed in. For we know that instruction is very often coldly received without the addition of exhortations. It might 				indeed seem strange,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">133</FONT></A>
 				 how so much wealth could be possessed by a miserably pillaged people, and long driven to servile work; unless it may be inferred from the abundance which is here described, that they were incredibly enriched at their departure from Egypt by the booty which God gave them. The kingdom of Egypt was very wealthy; and its people, as we know, had always been devoted to pleasures and luxuries. What, then, they had accumulated by their rapacity in many years, flowed away 				from them by the secret influence of God, when they were suddenly made prodigal. But, just as He had blinded the Egyptians, that they should profusely give all they had, so He now directed the minds and hearts of His people, that, mindful of so great a benefit, they should willingly expend, at His command, what they had obtained of His mere grace.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.iii.xi-p40"></A> "Particular stress is laid on the contrast, which the condition of the Israelitish nation at that time presents to the splendor and speedy completion of the tent. That tent was certainly splendid, but, in point of fact, exceedingly simple in its construction. If we compare it with the monuments of Egyptian architecture, its relative simplicity must strike us in a much greater degree. As to the materials that were 					 required for it, it admits of proof that the Israelites might well have been possessed of them at that time. The wilderness even might supply them with many of these things. With respect to other things, the metals, precious stones, etc, we must keep in view the condition of a people that had just come out of Egypt. History describes that country as having mercantile transactions with Asia, even from the earliest times. The people had acquired property, in part at least, in Egypt; the 					 description in <a name="iii.iii.xi-p40.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#000">Ex 32</a><a name="iii.iii.xi-p40.2"></A>, leaves us no doubt as to the possessions, and even wealth, that they had gained there. They had not gone out of Egypt empty-handed, but richly provided with silver and gold, <a name="iii.iii.xi-p40.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#036">Ex 12:36</a><a name="iii.iii.xi-p40.3"></A>. &#8212; &#8220;Havernick, Introd. to Pentat.
