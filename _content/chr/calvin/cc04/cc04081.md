meum, ne detegatur turpitude tua juxta illud.

<span id="iii.v.iv-p7"></span>**26.** *Neither shalt thou go up.* When
God had prescribed modesty to the priests in their whole life, and in
their private actions, no wonder that He should require especial care of
decency and propriety in the performance of their sacred duties. He had
indeed already desired that the priests should wear drawers or breeches
when they went into the sanctuary; yet not content with this symbol of
purity, He forbids them to ascend the altar by steps, lest haply the
drawers themselves should be seen; since the dignity and sanctity of
sacred things would thus be impaired. By all means, therefore, He would
induce the Israelites to conduct themselves most purely and most
chastely in the exercises of religion.
