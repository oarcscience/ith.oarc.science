<span id="iv.ii.ii-p7"></span>**13.** *Make no mention of the name of
other gods.* There is no sort of doubt but that this declaration should
be connected with the Third Commandment. Moses explains that God’s name
is taken in vain and abused, if men swear by other gods; for it is not
lawful to refer the judgment of things unknown to any other than the one
true God. Consequently, the glory of the Deity is transferred to those
by whose name men swear. Therefore by the Prophet God pronounces a
severe denunciation, that He will destroy all those that swear by His
name, and also by Malcham, (<span id="iv.ii.ii-p7.1"></span>[Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005)<span id="iv.ii.ii-p7.1"></span>,)
since thus the Jews mixed Him up with their idol, and so profaned His
holiness. In sum, since by swearing we profess that He is our God, whom
we declare to be both the knower of our hearts and the judge of our
souls, the true God justly claims this honor for Himself alone, inasmuch
as the glory of His name is detracted from, not only if we speak less
reverently than we should of Him, but also if we associate with Him such
as may usurp a part of His rights. And this more clearly appears from
the two passages which we have adduced from Deuteronomy, wherein the
people are commanded to swear by the name of the one God, which is
equivalent to rendering to His sacred name in our outward profession of
service the unmixed reverence which it deserves.  <span
id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310) Still God does not exhort the people
to indulge themselves freely in oaths, as if by frequent oaths they
exercised themselves in the duties of piety, but simply means that when
there is occasion for it or necessity, and a just cause shall demand it,
they must swear in no other way than by invoking Him alone as their
witness and judge.

vaut autant comme de luy rendre l’hommage qu’il merite, en le
constituant tesmoin des choses cachees, et confessant que c’est a luy
seul de maintenir la verite;” which is equivalent to rendering to Him
the homage He deserves, in constituting Him the witness of hidden
things, and confessing that it is His alone to maintain the truth. —
