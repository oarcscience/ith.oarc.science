 				 such as may rather gratify than instruct my readers. First, since the whole human race is corrupt and infected with many impurities, so that his uncleanness prevents every single individual from having access to God, Moses, before he consecrates the priests, washes them by the sprinkling of water, in order that they may be no longer deemed to be of ordinary rank. Hence we gather that true purity and innocence, which was but typical in the Law, is found in Christ 				alone. &#8220;For such an high priest became us,&#8221; says the Apostle, &#8220;who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners,&#8221; to present Himself before God for us. (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p76.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026">Heb 7:26</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p76.4"></A>.) After they had been washed, God commands that they should be invested with the sacerdotal dress, according to their respective ranks: that the high priest should 				wear the ephod with the <i>Urim </i>and <i>Thummim, </i>and the mitre with the golden plate, on which shone forth &#8220;holiness to Jehovah;&#8221; and in the third place, He adds the anointing. This preparation was for the purpose of initiating them, before they performed the office of sacrificing; but it must be observed that, as to this first sacrifice, the duties which were afterwards transferred to Aaron were 				imposed upon Moses, as if he were the only priest; and, in point of fact, the temporal dignity which he afterwards resigned to his brother, was still in his own hands. What Moses introduces about the division of the victim, we shall more conveniently explain elsewhere, in treating of the offerings, which we have stated to be the third part of the legal worship.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iv.ii-p77"></A><a name="iii.iv.ii-p77.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p78"></A><b>16.</b> <i>And thou shalt slay the ram.</i> Moses had previously been commanded to take the parts of the victim from the hands of Aaron, to propitiate God with them, in order that he and his posterity might be able hereafter to perform the same office; but here a peculiar ceremony is 				described, that he should smear the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the toe of the right foot, both of Aaron and his sons, with the blood of a ram; and then that he should sprinkle them and their garments with the blood which was deposited upon the altar. What we must first observe here is, that the priest must be sprinkled with blood, in order that he may conciliate the favor of God towards himself for the purpose of intercession. Thus the priesthood of Christ was dedicated with 				blood, so that it might be efficacious to reconcile God with us. The question now arises, why only the right ear and the right thumb and toe were sprinkled with blood, as if the priests were consecrated and devoted to God only in half of their persons? I reply, that in this one part the other was comprehended; since both the ears, and both the hands and feet have the same object, and their offices are so connected, that what is said of one 				ear applies to the other. Again, it is asked, why the ear, and foot, and hand, were smeared rather than the breast and the tongue? and I do not doubt but that by the ear obedience was designated, and by the hands and feet all the actions and the whole course of life; for there is scarcely anything more common in Scripture than these metonymies, by which the cleanness of the hands is taken for the integrity of the whole life, and the way, or course, or walk for the direction, or manner of 				living. It is therefore very appropriate that man&#8217;s life should be consecrated by blood; and, inasmuch as the foundation of welldoing is obedience, which is preferred to all sacrifices, Moses is commanded to begin with the ear. And we know that the &#8220;odor of a sweet smell&#8221; in the sacrifice of Christ was obedience, (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p78.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018">Php 4:18</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p78.2"></A>;) on which account, David, in the spirit of 				prophecy, introduces himself, saying, &#8220;Mine ears hast thou bored.&#8221;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">175</FONT></A>
 				 (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p79.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006">Ps 40:6</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p79.2"></A>.) If any should object that the tongue is of no less importance, because the priest is the messenger of the Lord of hosts, I answer that the office of teaching is not here referred to, but only that of intercession; wherefore in these three members Moses embraced whatever related to atonement. But we must remember that what is said of the 				consecration of Christ does not apply to His own person, but refers to the profit of the whole Church; for neither was He anointed for His own sake, nor had He need to borrow   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">176</FONT></A>
 				 grace from the blood; but He had regard to His members, and devoted Himself altogether to their salvation, as He himself testifies, &#8220;For their sake I sanctify myself.&#8221; (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p80.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019">Joh 17:19</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p80.2"></A>.)</p>

<p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p82"></A><b>28.</b> <i>And it shall be Aaron&#8217;s.</i> Lest the dignity of the sacred offerings, which are called the holiness of the Lord, should be impaired, strangers are prohibited from partaking of them; for, if it had been permitted that every one should touch them and eat of them, there would have 				been no distinction between them and ordinary food. Of the priests&#8217; portion some parts were common to all their families; but the holy parts were excepted, to the intent that by this particular instance the reverence due to all might be inculcated. The reference to place has the same object, for it was not lawful to eat what was holy within the walls of their houses, in order that it might be distinguished from their common and ordinary food. For the same reason, whatever remained of it was to 				be burnt, lest, if the flesh became rank, or the bread moldy, their ill savor and filthy appearance might somewhat detract from the dignity of the holy things; for the infirmity of the ancient people had need of childish rudiments, which might still have a tendency to elevate the minds of the pious to things above. This was the object of all these things, that no corruption should creep in which might pollute or render contemptible the service of God.</p>
