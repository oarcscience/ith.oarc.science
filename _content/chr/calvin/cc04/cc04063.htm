<p><a name="iii.iii.xx-p25"></A><b>1.</b> <i>And thou shalt make an altar.</i> God now issues His commands respecting the altar of burnt incense, whereby the people were assured that the odor of the worship under the Law was sweet to Him. This ceremony indeed also prevailed among the Gentiles; whence there is frequent 				mention made by heathen authors of incense-burning; but what its object was they knew not themselves, nor did they care to reflect upon its proper intention, since they conceived themselves to have done all that was required of them, by the bare sign itself. In this way, however, God would encourage His believing people, by giving them to know that the worship which they offered at this command sent up to him a sweet savor. Meanwhile He admonished them diligently to beware lest any uncleanness 				should profane their sacrifices, but that they should come cleansed and pure into His sight. And David applies this type specially to prayer, when he says:</p>  			 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iii.xx-p26"></A>"Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense.&#8221; <br> 				(<a name="iii.iii.xx-p26.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002">Ps 131:2</a><a name="iii.iii.xx-p26.2"></A>.)</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xx-p27"></A>Therefore, as the other altar of which we have been hearing, was devoted to the victims for the purpose of propitiating God, so also this altar perfumed the sacrifices with the odor of its incense, that they might be acceptable to God. Hence it was placed near the ark of the testimony, though with the vail between, that its savor might ascend directly to God without any let or hindrance. There is no ambiguity in the words, except that 				some think there is a repetition where it is said, &#8220;every morning,&#8221; and &#8220;between the two evens;&#8221;  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_151"></A><A HREF="#fn_151"><FONT SIZE="1">152</FONT></A>
 				others suppose that there are two separate oblations, and this latter view is the more probable, <i>i.e., </i>that the incense was offered morning and evening. He afterwards forbids either the altar itself to be transferred to other uses, or any other kind of incense to be burnt upon it; of this he will speak elsewhere.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.xx-p29"></A><a name="iii.iii.xx-p29.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xx-p30"></A><b>10.</b> <i>And Aaron shall make an atonement.</i> We should observe here the correspondence between the two altars; for, as the Israelites were admonished that the sacrifices would not please God, unless all uncleanness were wiped away by pure and holy prayers, so also the altar of 				incense was purified by the sprinkling of blood, that they might learn that their prayers obtained acceptance through sacrifices. Although this was only done once a year, yet it was daily to be called to mind, in order that they might offer the death of Christ by faith and prayer,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_152"></A><A HREF="#fn_152"><FONT SIZE="1">153</FONT></A>
 				 and yet might know that their prayers had no sweet savor, unless in so far as they were sprinkled with the blood of atonement.</p>
