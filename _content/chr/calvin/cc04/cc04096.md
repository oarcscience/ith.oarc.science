*whether* of the seed of the land, *or* of the fruit of the tree, *is*
the LORD’S: *it is* holy unto the LORD.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p4"></span>**30.** Onmes autem decimae terrae sive
de semine terrae, sive de fructu arborum, Jehovae sunt, sanctitas
Jehovae.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p5"></span>**31.** And if a man will at all redeem
*ought* of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth *part* thereof.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p6"></span>**31.** Si vero redimendo redemerit vir
allquid de decimis suis, quintam ejus partem addet ultra eam.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p7"></span>**32.** And concerning the tithe of the
herd, or of the flock, *even* of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the
tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p8"></span>**32.** Et onmis decima boum et ovium,
omnium nempe quae transeunt sub virga, decima inquam pars erit sanctitas
Jehovae.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p9"></span>**33.** He shall not search whether it
be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all,
then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be
redeemed.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p10"></span>**33.** Non disquiret utrum bonum an
malum, neque permutabit illud: quod si commutando commutaverit ipsum,
erit tam hoc quam illud quod commutatum *est,* erit inquam
sanctificatio, non redimetur.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p13"></span>**30.** *And all the tithe of the
land.* In these words God shews that in assigning the tithes to the
Levites, He ceded His own rights, inasmuch as they were a kind of royal
revenue; and thus He bars all complaint, since otherwise the other
tribes might have murmured on being unduly burdened. He therefore
appoints the priests as His receivers, to collect in His name what could
not be refused without impious and sacrilegious fraudulency. In the
provision that, where the tithes are redeemed by a money payment, a
fifth part should be added to their value, the object is not that the
Levites should make a gain of the loss of others; but, because the
owners of property craftily aimed at some advantage in this commutation
of corn for money, frauds are thus prevented whereby something would be
lost to the Levites by this deceptive exchange. On the same grounds He
commands that the animals, whatever they might be, should be given as
tithe, and does not permit them to be redeemed by money, since, if the
choice had been free, no fat or healthy animal would have ever come to
the Levites. Therefore, in this law a remedy was applied to avarice and
meanness, and not without good cause; for if the proverb be true, that
“good laws spring from evil habits,”  <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215) it was necessary that so covetous and
ill-disposed a people should be restrained in the path of duty by the
utmost severity. And although such careful provision was made for the
Levites, yet there was scarcely any period in which they did not suffer
from want, and sometimes they wandered about half-starved; nay, after
the return from the Babylonish captivity, the memory of so great a
blessing did not prevent a part of the tithes from being surreptitiously
withheld from them; as God complains in <span
id="iii.vii.ii-p14.3"></span>[Mal
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008)<span
id="iii.vii.ii-p14.3"></span>. Whence it appears that it was not without
purpose that the people were so imperiously enjoined to pay them.
