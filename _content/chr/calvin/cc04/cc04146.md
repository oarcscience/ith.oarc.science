<span id="iv.iii.i-p3"></span>**15.** And thou shalt speak unto the
children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his
sin.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p4"></span>**15.** Ad filios Israel loqueris,
dicendo: Homo qui maledixerit Dec sue, portabit scelus suum.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p5"></span>**16.** And he that blasphemeth the name
of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, *and* all the congregation
shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in
the land, when he blasphemeth the name *of the LORD,* shall be put to
death.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p6"></span>**16.** Et qui transfixerit nomen Jehovae,
morte moriatur: lapidando lapidabit eum universus coetus, sive indigena
fuerit, sive peregrinus, quum transfixerit nomen, moriatur.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p8"></span><span id="iv.iii.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i-p9"></span>**15.** *And thou shalt speak unto the
children of Israel.* Hence it now more clearly appears that the object
of the Third Commandment was that God’s holy name should be honored with
the respect and veneration which it deserves, since the insult whereby
it is violated is condemned to capital punishment. By the expression
“cursing,” Moses designates all profane and impure words which tend to
brand it with dishonor; as if any one should accuse God either of
injustice or cruelty; or should assail Him with blasphemies; or
designedly detract from His glory either in anger or wantonness, since
many, when exasperated, launch forth horrible blasphemies, whilst others
make a parade of their audacity by scoffing at Him. The second verb,
which is twice repeated in the next verse, <span
id="iv.iii.i-p9.2"></span>נקב, *nakab,*  <span
id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327) means in Hebrew to hollow out or
perforate, and metaphorically to unfold, thus the Latins say that what
is thoroughly brought out is “enucleated.” The source of the metaphor as
applied to contumely is not very dissimilar. The translation “he who
shall have expressed,” which some give, is lame; to me the word
“transfix” seems to be very suitable in the present passage, nor are the
Latin phrases *proscindere* or *lacerate* very different. As to the
meaning there is tolerable agreement, *i.e.,* that God would not have
His holy name disrespectfully traduced; and assuredly it is
insupportably impious when the tongue of mortal man, which was created
to celebrate the praises of God, is employed in insulting Him. The kind
of death is also appointed, when He commands the offender to be stoned
by the whole people, so that all may learn from the sight that such a
monster should be annihilated as contaminating the earth. God also would
prove the zeal of His people, by calling them all forth in defense of
His glory, and arming them for vengeance. Moreover, He did not subject
to this punishment the Jews only, who professed to be His worshippers,
but also strangers who were dwelling in the land in the exercise of
their business; viz., that they might more severely punish the crime in
His own servants who were less excusable.
