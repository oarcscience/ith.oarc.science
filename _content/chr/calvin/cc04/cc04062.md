a bullock *for* a sin-offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the
altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint
it, to sanctify it.

<span id="iii.iii.xix-p4"></span>**36.** Juvencum pro peccato facies in
singulos dies pro expiationibus: et expiabis altare expiando ipsum,
ungesque illud ad ipsum sanctificandum.

<span id="iii.iii.xix-p5"></span>**37.** Seven days thou shalt make an
atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most
holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.

<span id="iii.iii.xix-p6"></span>**37.** Septem diebus expiabis altare
et sanctificabis illud: eritque sanctitas sanctitatum: quicquid
tetigerit altare, sanctificabitur.

<span id="iii.iii.xix-p9"></span>**36.** *And thou shalt offer every day
a bullock.* Since the ancient altar was no less a type of Christ than
the priest was, it may naturally be asked, what its *expiation* could
mean, as if there were anything impure or polluted in Christ. But we
must remember, what I before adverted to, that no similitude is
identical (with the reality); for then the substance and reality of the
shadows could not be represented in their perfection. Yet this was an
apt similitude, shewing that God could only be propitiated towards the
human race by an expiation made with blood. On this account not only was
the altar to be cleansed, but; also dedicated to its use, that
reconciliation might proceed from it; and this is expressed by the word
“sanctify,” especially when it is added, “it shall be the holiness of
holinesses,”  <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150) that it may
sanctify whatever is put upon it. Others read it in the masculine
gender: “Whosoever shall touch it, shall be holy;” and understand it of
the priest, who by right of his anointing might approach the altar; but;
it rather dignifies the consecration of the altar by its consequence,
viz., because it sanctifies the victims themselves. The sum is that the
body of Christ, inasmuch as it was offered as a sacrifice, and
consecrated with blood, was acceptable to God; so that its holiness
washes away and blots out all our uncleanness. We shall speak of the
anointing a little further on.

<span id="iii.iii.xix-p10"></span> *A.V.,* “And it shall be an altar
most holy.” Ainsworth, *in loco,* says: “*Heb. holinesse of holinesses;
i.e.,* most holy, not only sanctified itself, but sanctifying the gifts
that were offered to God upon it."
