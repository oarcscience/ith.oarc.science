<p><a name="iii.v.i-p23"></A><b>7.</b> <i>They shall not take a wife.</i> The third kind of purity is in marriage itself, that the priests&#8217; home may be chaste and free from all dishonor. At this time also God commands by the mouth of Paul, that pastors should be chosen, who rule well their own houses, whose wives are chaste 				and modest, and their children well-behaved. (<a name="iii.v.i-p23.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002">1Ti 3:2</a><a name="iii.v.i-p23.1"></A>; <a name="iii.v.i-p23.2"></A>Titus 1:6.) The same cause for this existed under the Law, lest those appointed for the government of the Church should be despised and looked down upon on account of their domestic vices. But God most especially had 				regard to the priesthood of Christ, that it should not be exposed to contempt. It was indeed permitted that men should marry with impunity a woman divorced from her husband; though in the sight of God such an union was unlawful. No law forbade private individuals from marrying a deflowered woman; but what was permitted to the multitude God condemned in the priests, in order to withdraw them from every mark of infamy. And this reason is also expressed when he says that He would have the priests 				holy, because He has chosen them for Himself; for if the people had not reverenced them, all religion would have been contemptible. Therefore that their dignity might be preserved, He commands them to take diligent heed not to expose themselves to ignominy. Finally, still more highly to commend reverence to their holy office, He reminds them that it related to the welfare of the whole people: &#8220;I the Lord (He says) do sanctify him,&#8221; <a name="iii.v.i-p23.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#015">Le 21:15</a><a name="iii.v.i-p23.3"></A>. In these words He intimates that the grace of adoption, whereby they were chosen as His heritage, was based on the priesthood.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.v.i-p24"></A><a name="iii.v.i-p24.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.v.i-p25"></A><b>13.</b> <i>And he shall take a wife in her virginity.</i> More is required in the high priest, viz., that he should not marry a widow, nor a woman of any other tribe than his own. A question may indeed arise as to the latter clause, whether the plural word ought to 				be restricted to one tribe,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_188"></A><A HREF="#fn_188"><FONT SIZE="1">189</FONT></A>
 				 whereas it is elsewhere applied to all. But, if we examine it more closely, it is plain that &#8220;his peoples&#8221; is equivalent to &#8220;of his people,&#8221; (<i>populares.</i>) But nothing peculiar will be here required of the priest, if his wife is to be taken only from the children of Abraham. I admit that the chief priests married wives 				of Other tribes, as Elizabeth, sprung of the tribe of Judah, married Zacharias; but, since the high priest is here distinguished from all others, I do not see how it would follow that a law or privilege referring to him should be observed by the whole posterity of Aaron. On this point, however, I will not contend, if any one thing is otherwise. But assuredly, since he presented the brightest type of Christ, it was right that superior and more perfect holiness should be beheld in 				him.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_189"></A><A HREF="#fn_189"><FONT SIZE="1">190</FONT></A>
 				 For this was the tendency of the restriction, that his wife, not having known another man, should manifest the modesty worthy of her station and quality of sacred honor. If any should object that the marriage of, an old priest with a young girl was ridiculous and somewhat indecorous, as well as liable to many inconveniences; I answer, that special regulations should be so expounded as not to interfere with general principles. If a decrepit old man falls in love 				with a young girl, it is a base and shameful lust; besides he will defraud her if he marries her. Hence, too, will jealousy and wretched anxiety arise; or, by foolishly and dotingly seeking to preserve his wife&#8217;s love, he will cast away all regard for gravity. When God forbade the high priest to marry any but a virgin, he did not wish to violate this rule, which is dictated by nature and reason; but, regard being had to age, He desired that modesty and propriety should be maintained in the 				marriage, so that, if the priest were of advanced years, he should marry a virgin not too far from his own age: but, if he were failing and now but little fitted for marriage on account of his old age, the law that he should marry a virgin was rather an exhortation to celibacy, than that he should expose himself to many troubles and to general ridicule.</p>

<p><a name="iii.v.i-p29"></A><b>9.</b> <i>And the daughter of any priest.</i> The moderation and chastity (required in the priest   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">191</FONT></A>
 				 ) is extended also to his daughter; and by <i>synecdoche </i>all that relates to good discipline is comprised under a single head; viz., that his children should be educated in the study of virtue, and in decent and pure morality. A heavy punishment is denounced against a priest&#8217;s daughter if she should play the harlot, because sacrilege would be combined with her disgraceful licentiousness. But it is no light crime to 				violate God&#8217;s sanctuary; and, if the priest had tolerated such an iniquity in his daughter, he would have been no severe avenger of the same turpitude in strangers; nay, he would not have been at liberty to punish crimes, unless he made a beginning in his own house.</p>
