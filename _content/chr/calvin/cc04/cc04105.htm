<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.ix.ii-p34"></A><a name="iii.ix.ii-p34.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ix.ii-p35"></A><b>1.</b> <i>And the Lord spake unto Moses.</i> Moses, being about to speak again of the &#8220;continual&#8221; sacrifice, premises in general that the people should diligently follow in their offerings whatever God has enjoined; for by the word &#8220;observe,&#8221; (<i>custodiendi,</i>) not only diligence, but obedience is also expressed. But, in order that they should more earnestly beware of every transgression, God calls either that which was wont daily to be placed on the table, or that which was annexed to the burnt-offerings, <i>His </i>bread, as if He ate of it after the manner of men. It is indeed a hard expression, but the 				rudeness of His ancient people obliged Him to speak thus grossly, that, on the one hand, they might learn this rite to be acceptable to God, just as food is acceptable to man; and, on the other, that they might study to offer their sacrifices more purely and chastely.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.ix.ii-p36"></A><a name="iii.ix.ii-p36.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ix.ii-p37"></A><b>3.</b> <i>And thou shalt say unto them.</i> He repeats what we have seen in Exodus, that they should kill two lambs daily, one in the morning, and the other in the evening; but he speaks more fully of the concomitants of flour and wine, and 				also refers to the antiquity of this kind of sacrifice as its recommendation, because it began to be offered to God on Mount Sinai, and was a &#8220;savor of rest.&#8221;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_235"></A><A HREF="#fn_235"><FONT SIZE="1">236</FONT></A>
 				 The libation of wine, of which mention is made, was also in use among heathen nations; but, inasmuch as it was without the command and promise of God, it could not but be unmeaning (<a name="iii.ix.ii-p38.1"></A><i>insipidum</i> )   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_236"></A><A HREF="#fn_236"><FONT SIZE="1">237</FONT></A>
 				 And it is probable (as we have seen elsewhere) that many of the heathen rites descended from the ancient fathers but as a false and empty imitation; for when they had forgotten the reason of them, all they did could only be a mere theatrical pageantry. But we have said that thus men were reminded always to have God before their eyes in their daily food; and therefore in every way to 				accustom themselves to cultivate holiness.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.ix.ii-p40"></A><a name="iii.ix.ii-p40.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ix.ii-p41"></A><b>9.</b> <i>And on the Sabbath-day.</i> What was omitted in the former passage is here supplied, i.e., that on the Sabbath the continual sacrifice was to be doubled, and two lambs offered instead of one; for it was reasonable that, as the 				seventh day was peculiarly dedicated to God, it should be exalted above other days by some extraordinary and distinctive mark. He also commands greater sacrifices to be offered at the beginning of the month or new moon, viz., two bullocks and one ram, and a goat for a sin-offering; for we know that the first day of every month was consecrated to God, that the people might more frequently have the remembrance of their religious duties renewed; 				and the goat for an atonement for sin was added, in order that every month they should present themselves as guilty before God to deprecate His wrath.</p>
