<span id="ii.i.ii-p3"></span>**1.** And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,

<span id="ii.i.ii-p4"></span>**1.** Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen,
dicendo:

<span id="ii.i.ii-p5"></span>**2.** Command the children of Israel, that
they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue,
and whosoever is defiled by the dead:

<span id="ii.i.ii-p6"></span>**2.** Praecipe filiis Israel ut ejiciant e
castris omnem leprosum, omnem seminifluum, et omnem immundum super
anima.

<span id="ii.i.ii-p7"></span>**3.** Both male and female shall ye put
out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their
camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.

<span id="ii.i.ii-p8"></span>**3.** Tam masculum quam faeminam
ejicietis: extra castra ejicietis eos, ne contaminent castra sua, quia
ego habito in medio eorum.

<span id="ii.i.ii-p11"></span>**2.** *Command the children of Israel.*
This passage clearly shews that God, in desiring the lepers to be put
out of the camp, was not acting as a physician by any means, and merely
consulting the health of the people: but that by this external rite and
ceremony He exercised them in the pursuit of purity; for, by joining
with the lepers those who had an issue,  <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1) and who were defiled by the dead, He
instructs the people simply to keep away from all uncleanness. The
reason, which follows, confirms this, — “that they defile not their
camps, in the midst whereof He dwells.” It is just as if He had said,
that all the habitations of His elect people were parts of His
sanctuary, which it was a shame to defile with any pollution. For we
know what license men give themselves in corrupting  <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2) the service of God, by mixing, as the
proverb says, sacred things with profane. Thus we see that the very
worst of men boast themselves to be anything but the least zealous of
His worshipers, and spare not to lift up polluted hands, although God so
sternly repudiates them. It was, then, profitable that the ancient
people should be reminded by this visible proof, that all those who are
defiled cannot duly serve God, but that they rather pollute. with their
filthiness what is otherwise holy, and thus grossly abuse religious
exercises; and again, that they ought not tobe tolerated in the holy
congregation, lest their infection should spread to others. Let us now
briefly examine <span id="ii.i.ii-p13.3"></span>[Leviticus
