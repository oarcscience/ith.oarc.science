<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>[Exodus
30:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#017)<span
id="iii.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p2"></span>**17.** And the LORD spake unto Moses,
saying,

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p3"></span>**17.** Loquutus est etiam Jehova ad
Mosen, dicendo:

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p4"></span>**18.** Thou shalt also make a laver
*of* brass, and his foot *also of* brass, to wash *withal:* and thou
shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar,
and thou shalt put water therein.

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p5"></span>**18.** Facies et concham aeneam, et
basin ejus aeneam ad lavandum, ponesque illam inter tabernaculum
conventionis et altare, et pones aquam ill ea.

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p6"></span>**19.** For Aaron and his sons shall
wash their hands and their feet thereat:

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p7"></span>**19.** Lavabuntque ex ea Aharon et
filii ejus manus suas et pedes suos.

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p8"></span>**20.** When they go into the
tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they
die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn
offering made by fire unto the LORD:

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p9"></span>**20.** Quando ingredientur
tabernaculum conventionis lavabunt se aqua, ut non moriantur: aut quum
appropinquabunt ad altare, ut ministrent, ut incendant oblationem
ignitam Jehovae.

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p10"></span>**21.** So they shall wash their
hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for
ever to them, *even* to him and to his seed throughout their
generations.

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p11"></span>**21.** Lavabunt inquam manus suas et
pedes suos, ne moriantur: eritque illis statutum perpetuum, ei scilicet
et semini ejus per generationes suas.

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p12"></span> 

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p13"></span><span id="iii.iii.xxii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p14"></span>**18.** *Thou shalt also make a laver
of brass.* Although this oblation was a sign of the purity which God
required in His priests, yet, inasmuch as this hollow vessel (*concha*)
or laver, which supplied the water, was a part or utensil of the
sanctuary, I have thought it best to insert here what is ordained
respecting it, not only as to its fashion, but also its use, which could
not be well separated: for if bare mention had only been made of a laver
or water-vessel,  <span id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154) the reader
would have received no profit from it. But, when God expressly commands
that water should always be ready in this basin for the priests to wash
their hands and feet, we gather from hence with what reverence and
sanctity God would have His holy service performed. It was, indeed, a
common proverb among the Gentiles that they were guilty of impiety who
handled holy things with unwashen hands, and they testified in this
ceremony that they could not worship God aright except when purified
from all pollution and uncleanness. One in Virgil says: —

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p16"></span><span
id="iii.iii.xxii-p16.1"></span><span id="iii.iii.xxii-p16.2"></span>"———
<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p16.3"></span>donec me flumine vivo Abluero."
 <span id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155)

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p19"></span>"Till in some living stream I cleanse
the guilt  
Of dire debate and blood in battle spilt.” — Dryden.

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p20"></span>And such expressions are of constant
occurrence. Sometimes they even seemed almost to hit the right point; as
where the poet commands the ungodly and the criminal to depart from the
sacrifices, lest they should contaminate them;  <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156) but this was only a fleeting
imagination, since no anxiety to repent had awakened in them a desire to
propitiate God; and so, even whilst they were diligent in performing
ablutions, their minds, darkened with error, knew not what it meant. But
the Israelites were thus chiefly reminded how unworthy they were to
offer sacrifices to God, since the impurity of the very priests, who
were chosen to this once, prevented them from exercising it, until they
were cleansed with water. The washing of the hands and feet denoted that
all parts of the body were infected with uncleanness; for, since
Scripture often uses the word “hands” for the actions of life, and
compares the whole course of life to a way or journey, it is very
suitable to say by *synecdoche* that all impurity is purged away by the
washing of the hands and feet. The comparison with Christ now remains to
be considered; but this we shall understand better a little beyond in
reference to the sacrifices.
