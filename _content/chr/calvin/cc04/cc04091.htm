<p><a name="iii.vi.iii-p19"></A><b>16.</b> <i>And the remainder thereof.</i> He repeats what we have seen just before, that the residue of those oblations, in which there was peculiar holiness, should belong to the priests; but upon condition that they should be eaten nowhere except in the sanctuary. A special precept is 				also given as to the <i>minha, </i>(meat-offering,) that it should not be made into leavened bread; for thus the meal, which had been already dedicated to God, would be changed into common food, which could not be done without profanation. Since, then, God admits the priests, as it were, to His own table, the dignity of their office is not a little heightened by this privilege; yet in such a manner as that by their liberty the reverence due to God&#8217;s 				service may not be impaired. Afterwards Moses confirms in general terms that right, which had been before assigned to them, that they should take what remained of the burnt-offerings, on condition that it should be eaten by males only, and in the sacred place; in order that God&#8217;s presence may not only act as a restraint on their luxury and intemperance, but, also instruct them in the sobriety due from His servants, and, in a word, accustom them to exceeding purity, whilst they reflect that they 				are separated from all others. At the end of <a name="iii.vi.iii-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#018">Le 6:18</a><a name="iii.vi.iii-p19.1"></A>, some translate it in the neuter gender, &#8220;every <i>thing </i>that shall have touched them shall be holy:&#8221; but in this passage Moses seems to me to prescribe that none but the priests should touch the <i>minha. </i>It was said elsewhere of the 				altar and its vessels, that by virtue of their anointing they sanctified whatever was placed upon them; but we now see that ordinary men are prohibited from touching sacred things, that their sanctity may be inviolate. For we know that the sons of Aaron were anointed with this object, that they alone might be allowed to touch whatever was consecrated to God. Therefore the verb in the future tense is put for the imperative. So also it is soon afterwards said of the victims, <a name="iii.vi.iii-p19.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#027">Le 6:27</a><a name="iii.vi.iii-p19.2"></A>, &#8220;Whosoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy:&#8221;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">212</FONT></A>
 				 because Moses enacts this special law for the priests, that they alone should handle the sacrifices. Nor does what immediately follows contradict this, &#8220;when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof on any garment,&#8221; etc.; for he does not mean to say that the garments or any vessels would be consecrated by the mere touch; but it is an argument from the less to the greater; if it were not lawful to take a garment sprinkled with the blood, or the pots in which the 				flesh was dressed, out of the tabernacle, unless the garment were washed, or the pots broken or rinsed, much more were they to beware lest any of the ordinary people should meddle with it. For how shall a mortal man dare to lay a hand upon that holy thing (<i>sanctitati</i>) which could not even cleave to the garment; of a priest without atonement? The sum is that a thing so holy should not be mixed 				with unhallowed things.</p>
