<p><a name="v.iv.ii-p9"></A><b>4.</b> But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.</p>

<p><a name="v.iv.ii-p25"></A><b>20.</b> <i>And if ye shall say.</i> Men will never be obedient to God&#8217;s precepts, unless their distrust of Him is corrected, and will be always ingenious in laying hold of pretexts for disobedience. The difficulty, however, in this matter was a specious excuse for the Jews; for famine might 				have destroyed them in these two years, since in the seventh year they neither sowed nor reaped; and for reaping they were obliged to wait till the end of the eighth year. Now, whence were they to get seed enough to sow after the land had rested for a whole year? It is not without reason, then, that God delivers them from this doubt, promising them that He will give such abundance in the sixth year as shall suffice for the two following ones. The phrase must be observed, that God would &#8220;command 				His blessing&#8221; in an especial manner, and beyond the usual course, so that the land should be twice or thrice more fertile. Hence is suggested to us no ordinary ground of confidence in asking for our daily bread. But this was a special promise, that food should not fail the Jews on account of the Sabbatical year; a manifestation of which God had already given in the desert, when supplied a double portion of manna to those who gathered it on the day before the Sabbath. Now-a-days this 				inconvenience is avoided by the industry of farmers, who so divide their acres that the land should never lie fallow altogether, but that one part should supply the deficiency of another. This distribution did not obtain with the Jews. Therefore God relieved them from the fear of famine down to the harvest of the eighth year; although He seems at the same time to accustom them to frugality, lest they should waste in intemperance and luxury what He afforded in sufficient abundance to last for 				two years. To this precept He alludes, when He declares by the Prophets that the land &#8220;enjoyed her Sabbaths,&#8221; when it had vomited forth its inhabitants, (<a name="v.iv.ii-p25.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#021">2Ch 36:21</a><a name="v.iv.ii-p25.1"></A>;) for since they had polluted it by violating the Sabbath, so that it groaned as if under a heavy burden, He says that it shall rest for a long continuous 				period, so as to compensate for the labor of many years.</p>
