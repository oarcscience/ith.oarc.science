<span id="iii.v.v-p2"></span><span id="iii.v.v-p2.1"></span>[Numbers
6:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#022)<span id="iii.v.v-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v-p3"></span>**22.** And the LORD spake unto Moses,
saying,

<span id="iii.v.v-p4"></span>**22.** Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen,
dicendo:

<span id="iii.v.v-p5"></span>**23.** Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons,
saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto
them,

<span id="iii.v.v-p6"></span>**23.** Alloquere Aharon et filios ejus,
dicendo, Sic benedicetis filiis Israel, dicendo eis:

<span id="iii.v.v-p7"></span>**24.** The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:

<span id="iii.v.v-p8"></span>**24.** Benedicat tibi Jehova, et custodiat
te:

<span id="iii.v.v-p9"></span>**25.** The LORD make his face shine upon
thee, and be gracious unto thee:

<span id="iii.v.v-p10"></span>**25.** Lucere faciat Jehova faciem suam
super re, et misereatur tui:

<span id="iii.v.v-p11"></span>**26.** The LORD lift up his countenance
upon thee, and give thee peace.

<span id="iii.v.v-p12"></span>**26.** Attollat Jehova faciem suam ad te,
et constituat tibi pacem.

<span id="iii.v.v-p13"></span>**27.** And they shall put my name upon
the children of Israel, and I will bless them.

<span id="iii.v.v-p14"></span>**27.** Et ponent nomen meum super
filiosIsrael, et ego benedicam eis.

<span id="iii.v.v-p15"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.v-p16"></span><span id="iii.v.v-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v-p17"></span>**22.** *And the Lord spake unto Moses.* A
part of the sacerdotal duties, of which mention is constantly made in
the Law, is here briefly set forth; for God says that He had appointed
the priests to bless the people. To this David seems to allude in the
words:

<span id="iii.v.v-p18"></span>"We have blessed you out of the house of
the Lord.”  
(<span id="iii.v.v-p18.2"></span>[Ps
118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026)<span
id="iii.v.v-p18.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.v.v-p19"></span>This doctrine is especially profitable,
that believers may confidently assure themselves that God is reconciled
to them, when He ordains the priests to be witnesses and heralds of His
paternal favor towards them. The word to *bless* is often used for to
pray for blessings, which is the common duty of all pious persons; but
this rite (as we shall see a little farther on) was an efficacious
testimony of God’s grace; as if the priests bore from His own mouth the
commandment to bless. But Luke shews that this was truly fulfilled in
Christ, when he relates that “He lifted up His hands,” according to the
solemn rite of the Law, to bless His disciples. (<span
id="iii.v.v-p19.1"></span>[Lu
24:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#050)<span
id="iii.v.v-p19.1"></span>.) In these words, then, the priests were
appointed ambassadors to reconcile God to the people; and this in the
person of Christ, who is the only sufficient surety of God’s grace and
blessing. Inasmuch, therefore, as they then were types of Christ, they
were commanded to bless the people. But it is worthy of remark, that
they are commanded to pronounce the form of benediction audibly, and not
to offer prayers in an obscure whisper; and hence we gather that they
preached God’s grace, which the people might apprehend by faith.

<span id="iii.v.v-p20"></span><span id="iii.v.v-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v-p21"></span>**24.** *The Lord bless thee.* Blessing is
an act of His genuine liberality, because the abundance of all good
things is derived to us from His favor as their only source. It is next
added, that He should “keep” the people, by which clause lie intimates
that He is the sole defender of the Church, and protects it under His
guardianship; but since the main advantage of God’s grace consists in
our sense of it, the words, “and make His face shine on you,” are added;
for nothing is more desirable for the consummation of our happiness,
than that. we should behold the serene countenance of God; as it is said
in <span id="iii.v.v-p21.1"></span>[Ps
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006)<span id="iii.v.v-p21.1"></span>,

<span id="iii.v.v-p22"></span>"There be many that say, Who will shew us
any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us."

<span id="iii.v.v-p23"></span>Thus then I interpret this clause, that
the people may perceive and taste the sweetness of God’s goodness, which
may cheer them like the brightness of the sun when it illumines the
world in serene weather. But immediately afterwards the people are
recalled to the First cause; viz., God’s gratuitous mercy, which alone
reconciles Him to us, when we should be otherwise by our own deserts
hated and detested by Him. What follows, “The Lord lift up his
countenance upon thee,” is a common phrase of Scripture, meaning, May
God remember His people; not that forgetfulness can occur in Him, but
because we suppose that He has cast away His care of us, unless He
actually gives proof of His anxiety for our welfare. Finally, it is
added, may He “establish peace upon his people,” which others translate
a little less literally,  <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196) “put
thee into peace:” and since this word signifies not only rest and a
tranquil state, but also all prosperity and success, I willingly embrace
this latter sense, although even its proper signification is not
disagreeable to me.  <span id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197)

<span id="iii.v.v-p26"></span><span id="iii.v.v-p26.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v-p27"></span>**27.** *And they shall put my name.*
Although *Jerome* has rightly translated this, “They shall call upon my
name:” yet since the Hebrew phrase is emphatic, I have preferred
retaining it; for God deposits His name with the priests, that they may
daily bring it forward as a pledge of His good will, and of the
salvation which proceeds from thence. The promise, which is finally
subjoined, gives assurance that this was no empty or useless ceremony,
when He declares that He will bless the people. And hence we gather,
that whatsoever the ministers of the Church do by God’s command, is
ratified by Him with a real and solid result; since He declares nothing
by His ministers which He will not Himself fulfill and perform by the
efficacy of His Spirit. But we must observe that He does not so transfer
the office of blessing to His priests, as to resign this right to them;
for after having entrusted this ministry to them, He claims the
accomplishment of the thing for Himself alone.
