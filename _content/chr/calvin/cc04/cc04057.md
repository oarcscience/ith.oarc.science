<span id="iii.iii.xiv-p16"></span>3 Without the vail of the testimony,
in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the
evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: *it shall be a*
statute for ever in your generations.

<span id="iii.iii.xiv-p22"></span>**<span
id="iii.iii.xiv-p22.1"></span>[Exodus
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020)<span
id="iii.iii.xiv-p22.1"></span>** *And thou shalt command the children of
Israel.* I have transferred these two passages from elsewhere, since
they relate to the service of the tabernacle; for the children of Israel
are commanded to contribute as much oil as may be sufficient for the
seven lamps. Now, since Divine illumination and the grace of the Holy
Spirit were, as we have seen, the truth of this symbol, God requires
pure oil, *i.e.,* not muddy, or mixed with lees, for, had it been in any
respect faulty, so much would have been detracted from the dignity of
the mystery. Its purity, then, shewed that nothing mean or common was
signified by it; that the Israelites also might bring with them pure
minds, and duly prepared and disposed to consider the spiritual light.
He again repeats, that the oil must be supplied seasonably at its proper
hours, so that the lamps may be always burning; that thus the children
of Israel might learn that nothing is more opposed to the worship of God
than obscurity and darkness; and that it is not to be interrupted at
intervals,  <span id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136) but that the
direction of the Spirit should shine from heaven in a perpetual flow.
Thus, in the second passage cited, He thrice reiterates the word
“continually,” to shew that the true light should never be put out in
any respect. This office God enjoins upon the priests, because they
ought to be ministers of light when they are interpreting the Law, which
David calls “the lamp of our feet, and the light of our paths.” (<span
id="iii.iii.xiv-p23.2"></span>[Ps
119:105](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#105)<span
id="iii.iii.xiv-p23.2"></span>.) But what is the meaning of the offering
(of the oil) by the people, since men are possessed of no power for the
spiritual enlightening of their own minds? I reply that, in the types of
the Law, the several parts are not to be so scrupulously forced to the
rule, as if there were nothing in the outward sign with which the
reality did not correspond; and again, that although men having nothing
of their own and of themselves to bring, yet, that they may more
diligently exert themselves in their endeavors to serve God, they are
justly required to dedicate themselves and all that they have to God. At
the end, where the words “a statute for ever” are added, understand them
to mean, until the real manifestation of those things, of which the
candlestick and its lamps were a type. This point I have discussed in
Genesis  <span id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137) It is called “a statute
from the  <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138) children of Israel,”
(*a* *filiis* Israel*,*) since God requires its observance from them;
unless it be preferred to translate it with Jerome, “Before (*coram*)
the children of Israel.” The exposition of others, “among (*apud*) the
children of Israel,” or from the fathers to the children, is harsher,
and altogether forced.
