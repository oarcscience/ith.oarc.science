<p><a name="iii.x.xiii-p27"></A><b>38.</b> Which the LORD commanded Moses in Mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iii.x.xiii-p28"></A><b>38.</b> Quam praecepit Jehova Mosi in monte Sinai, die quo praecepit filiis Israel ut offerrent oblationes suas Jehovae in deserto Sinai.</p>

<p><a name="iii.x.xiii-p31"></A><b>19.</b> <i>And the flesh that toucheth.</i> It was not indeed lawful to eat of any polluted flesh, but in the sacrifices there was a special reason for this, <i>i.e., </i>because the uncleanness involved sacrilege. On this 				account he commands it to be burnt, just like that which had not been consumed within the legitimate time; and the punishment is,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_287"></A><A HREF="#fn_287"><FONT SIZE="1">288</FONT></A>
 				 that if any unclean person shall have touched the consecrated meat, he should be cut off from the people. The cruelty or immoderate severity of this has induced some to think that to be &#8220;cut off&#8221; is nothing more than to be cast out of the camp. But it is not wonderful that God should have thus severely dealt with those who knowingly and wilfully contaminated what was holy; for if any one had sinned in error, he was not to receive this sentence, but only he who had 				betrayed his open contempt of God by impious profanation of sacred things.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.x.xiii-p33"></A><a name="iii.x.xiii-p33.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.x.xiii-p34"></A><b>23.</b> <i>Speak unto the children of Israel.</i> Since in all sacrifices the fat was consecrated to God, and was burnt on the altar, God forbade His people to eat fat even in their ordinary meals, in order that they might cultivate piety even in their homes. For unquestionably this was 				an exercise of piety, that they who were far away from the temple should still accustom themselves in their daily meals to the service of God. Nor am I ignorant of the allegories   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_288"></A><A HREF="#fn_288"><FONT SIZE="1">289</FONT></A>
 				 in which some interpreters indulge, but I willingly acquiesce in the reason which God reveals, viz., that the people was prohibited from eating fat, because He had assigned it to Himself. Nevertheless, the Law permits the fat of a carcase,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_289"></A><A HREF="#fn_289"><FONT SIZE="1">290</FONT></A>
 				 or of an animal torn (by beasts) to be applied to any use, provided they abstain from the fat of those animals which might be legally offered.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.x.xiii-p37"></A><a name="iii.x.xiii-p37.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.x.xiii-p38"></A><b>37.</b> <i>This is the law of the burnt-offering.</i> In this conclusion Moses indicates that full provision had been made lest any addition should insinuate itself from man&#8217;s inventions to vitiate the sacrifices. In the day, he says, that God appointed the sacrifices to be offered to 				Him on Mount Sinai, He omitted nothing which was to be observed, lest men should dare to introduce anything except what He prescribed. And surely, when He had thus carefully embraced all the ceremonies, we may easily infer from hence how earnestly we should avoid all temerity and audacity in invention. The design, therefore, of Moses was in this brief admonition to exhort the people to soberness, lest they should transgress the limits placed by God.</p>
