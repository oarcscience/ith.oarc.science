<p class="Normal"><a name="xxii.i-p21"></A><a name="xxii.i-p21.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p22"></A><b>1.</b> <i>The burden of Moab.</i> Here the Prophet prophesies against the <i>Moabites</i>, who were neighbors to the Jews and related to them by blood; for we know that the <i>Moabites</i> were descended from Lot, who was Abraham&#8217;s 			 nephew. (<a name="xxii.i-p22.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031">Gen. 11:31</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#037">Gen. 19:37</a><a name="xxii.i-p22.1"></A>.) Those nations being so closely related, humanity at least demanded that they should maintain some friendly intercourse with each other. But no relationship prevented the <i>Moabites</i> from cherishing hostility towards the Jews, or even from harassing them whenever it was in their 			 power; which is an evidence of a savage and barbarous disposition. To them also, on account of their cruelty towards the people of God, to whom they ought to have conducted themselves with brotherly love, the Prophet therefore threatens destruction.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p23"></A>We ought to remember the design of these predictions. It cannot be believed that they were of any advantage to the <i>Moabites</i>, even though they had heard from the mouth of the Prophet himself the words which we read; but he neither addressed them with his voice, nor sent to them a written communication. It was therefore to believers, rather than to them, that the Prophet looked, and for two reasons. The first reason was, that when they 			 saw so many changes taking place, cities overturned, kingdoms destroyed and succeeding one another, they might not think that this world is governed by the blind violence of fortune, but might acknowledge the providence of God. If nothing had been foretold, the minds of men, having a strong tendency to foolishness, and being strangely blind to the works of God, might have been disposed to attribute all this to chance; but when they had been forewarned by the Prophets, they beheld the judgments 			 of God as from a lofty watch-tower. To us also in the present day Isaiah has, as it were, pointed out with the finger what was then hidden. In his predictions we behold God sitting on his judgment-seat, and regulating everything according to his pleasure; and although the wicked in various ways vented their mad rage, still the Lord made use of their agency to execute his judgments. The second design which the prophets had in view was, that while the whole world was shaken, the Jews might know 			 that God took care of their safety, and that he testified the warmth of his affection for the Church, by taking vengeance on her enemies by whom she had been barbarously treated.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p24"></A><i>Ar-Moab.</i> The Hebrew word <a name="xxii.i-p24.1"></A>&#1506;&#1512; (<i>Ar</i>) means <i>a city</i>; as <a name="xxii.i-p24.2"></A>&#1511;&#1497;&#1512; (<i>kir</i>) means <i>a wall</i>; but as <a name="xxii.i-p24.3"></A>&#1506;&#1512; &#1502;&#1493;&#1488;&#1489; (<i>Ar-Moab</i>) was one of the chief cities of the <i>Moabites</i>, it is supposed to be here a proper name. We might indeed explain both words as 			 appellatives, to convey a threatening of the overthrow of the fortified towns of which the <i>Moabites</i> are proud; but I rather adopt the ordinary interpretation. Here therefore Isaiah has given a description, that we may behold in it the overthrow of the Moabites, when their chief cities are destroyed.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p25"></A><i>In the night.</i> By <i>the night</i> he means a sudden and unexpected occurrence, which the Moabites did not dread. <i>Night</i> being appropriated to rest, if anything happen at that time, it is viewed as sudden and unlooked for, and therefore excites violent alarm. Besides, he 			 intended to rebuke the Moabites for being free from anxiety, considering themselves to be fortified by defences on every hand, and placed beyond the reach of all danger.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p26"></A><i>Is brought to silence.</i> That is, <i>is destroyed</i>, and hence also <i>Silence</i> sometimes means Death. Others disregard the metaphor, and choose to render it, <i>She is cut off</i>; but I 			 leave that point undecided. What Isaiah declares as to the <i>Moabites</i>, Scripture pronounces as to the reprobate, that destruction is at hand, and, when they are looking for nothing of that kind, will fearfully overwhelm them. (<a name="xxii.i-p26.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#019">Jer. 23:19</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002">1 Thess. 5:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003">3</a><a name="xxii.i-p26.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xxii.i-p27"></A><a name="xxii.i-p27.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p28"></A><b>2.</b> <i>He shall go up into the house.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_235"></A><A HREF="#fn_235"><FONT SIZE="1">236</FONT></A>
 			  So far as relates to the words, some pass by the Hebrew noun <a name="xxii.i-p41.2"></A>&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;, (<i>baith</i>;) but as it signifies <i>a house</i> and <i>a temple</i>, it is probable that it was the word commonly used for <i>a 			 temple</i>, as in many other passages <i>the</i> <i>house of God</i> means <i>the temple</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_236"></A><A HREF="#fn_236"><FONT SIZE="1">237</FONT></A>
 			  (<a name="xxii.i-p42.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019">Exod. 23:19</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#026">Exod. 34:26</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#018">Deut. 23:18</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#023">Josh. 9:23</a><a name="xxii.i-p42.1"></A>.) By representing the Moabites as bowing down before their idols, he at the same time condemns their superstition in worshipping their idol Chemosh, as may easily be inferred from <a name="xxii.i-p42.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007">1Ki 11:7</a><a name="xxii.i-p42.2"></A>, <a name="xxii.i-p42.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007">Jer. 48:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#013">13</a><a name="xxii.i-p42.3"></A>. &#8220;The Moabites,&#8221; says Isaiah, &#8220;shall betake themselves to their god when matters are so desperate, but to no purpose; for they shall find in him no assistance.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p43"></A><i>And to Dibon to the high places.</i> This makes it still more evident that he is speaking of the Temple; and it is beyond a doubt that the Moabites had a fortress remarkable and celebrated above the rest, in which they had built <i>high places</i> in honor of their idol. Being ignorant of the true God, to whom they might 			 betake themselves in adversity, we need not wonder that they betake themselves to an idol, in conformity to their ordinary custom. By doing this they increased their misery, and brought upon themselves an accumulation of all distresses; for they inflamed the wrath of God still more by those very means which they considered to be fitted for appeasing his wrath. He therefore wished to state more plainly the condition of the ungodly, who have no refuge in adversity; for as to those remedies which 			 they think will be adapted to their diseases, nothing can be more destructive to them, since they excite more and more the Lord&#8217;s indignation.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p44"></A><i>Moab shall howl over Nebo and over Medeba.</i> <i>Nebo</i> also was one of the cities of the <i>Moabites</i>. The Prophet has already named two of them, <i>Ar</i> and <i>Kir</i>; he now adds a 			 third, <i>Nebo</i>; and lastly he mentions a fourth, <i>Medeba</i>; as if he had said that this destruction would not only seize the extremities of that country, but would reach its inmost recesses, so that not one corner could be exempted.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p45"></A><i>On every head.</i> Every nation has its peculiar ceremonies to denote mourning or joy. The Italians and other western nations allowed the hair and beard to grow when they were in mourning; and hence arose the phrase, <i>to lengthen the beard</i>. On the other hand, the eastern nations shaved the head and beard, which they 			 reckoned to be ornamental; and when they reversed their ordinary custom, that was a token of mourning.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">238</FONT></A>
 			  Nothing else therefore is meant than that the condition of the whole kingdom will be so mournful, that the indications of mirth will be laid aside, and all will wear the tokens of grief and lamentation.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xxii.i-p47"></A><a name="xxii.i-p47.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p48"></A><b>3.</b> <i>In his streets.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_238"><FONT SIZE="1">239</FONT></A>
 			  He proceeds with the same subject, describing more fully the tokens of mourning, in which the eastern nations abound more than others; for, having quicker understandings and keener feelings, they express their emotions by outward signs more than others do, who, being slower in apprehension, are likewise slower in movement and gesture. It was no doubt faulty in them that they indulged in so many ceremonies and gesticulations; but the Prophet spoke of them as what was 			 known and common, only for the purpose of describing the grief which would follow the desolation of that country.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p50"></A><i>Every one shall howl and descend to weeping.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_239"><FONT SIZE="1">240</FONT></A>
 			  It was with good reason that he added this description; for we are never moved by predictions, unless the Lord place them, as it were, before our eyes. Lest the Jews should think that these matters might be lightly passed by, when he described that destruction, he determined to mention also <i>mourning, weeping, and howling</i>, that they might see almost with their own eyes those events which appear to be incredible, for 			 the Moabites were at that time in a state of profound peace, and believers had the more need of being confirmed, that they might not call this prophecy in question. By the same means he points out the despair to which unbelievers are liable in adversity, for the support on which they rely is insecure.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xxii.i-p52"></A><a name="xxii.i-p52.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p53"></A><b>4.</b> <i>And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh.</i> Here he names other cities; for his design is to bind up, as it were, in a bundle all the cities of that country, that they may be involved in the general destruction; as if he had said, that none at all shall be exempted.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p54"></A><i>Therefore the light-armed soldiers of Moab shall howl</i>. Though <a name="xxii.i-p54.1"></A>&#1506;&#1500; &#1499;&#1503; (<i>gnal ken</i>) literally signifies <i>therefore</i>, yet some think that a reason is not here 			 assigned; but that is of little importance. The Prophet shows that there will be none that does not <i>howl</i>; for he declares that the bold and courageous shall mourn. Next he adds, <i>the soul of every one shall howl to him.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_240"></A><A HREF="#fn_240"><FONT SIZE="1">241</FONT></A>
 			  Every one shall be so engrossed with his own grief, that he will not think of his neighbors.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xxii.i-p56"></A><a name="xxii.i-p56.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p57"></A><b>5.</b><i> My heart shall cry out for Moab.</i> At length he assumes the character of a mourner. But it may be thought to be strange and inconsistent in him to bewail the calamity of the Moabites; for he ought rather to have lamented the destruction of the Church, and to have rejoiced at the ruin of her enemies. It is customary with the prophets, 			 however, to assume in this manner the character of those whose calamities they foretell, and thus to exhibit their condition, as it were, on a stage; by which means they produce a stronger impression than if they delivered their instruction in a direct form. Yet there can be no doubt that the prophets shuddered at the judgments of God, even against the wicked; though the meaning which I have stated is simpler and more appropriate, and may easily be inferred from frequent usage.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p58"></A><i>His fugitives to Zoar,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_241"></A><A HREF="#fn_241"><FONT SIZE="1">242</FONT></A>
 			  <i>a heifer of three years old.</i> He calls them <i>fugitives</i> who shall escape from it; for he means that those who shall escape from Moab will come even <i>to Zoar</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_242"></A><A HREF="#fn_242"><FONT SIZE="1">243</FONT></A>
 			  Now, he compares <i>Zoar</i> to <i>a heifer of three years old</i>, which is in full vigor, and has not felt the pangs of birth, or toil, or the yoke, but revels in the buoyancy of mirth and wantonness. When men are hard pressed by an invading army, they flee to cities which have not been attacked, and which appear to be the farthest removed from danger. 			 Such was <i>Zoar</i>, for it had never been attacked by enemies. Yet, if it be thought better to view it as applying to the whole country, I have no objection; for Jeremiah appears to speak in general terms, though he borrows many statements from Isaiah. (<a name="xxii.i-p60.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034">Jer 48:34</a><a name="xxii.i-p60.1"></A>.) But perhaps in that passage also he names both <i>Zoar</i> and <i>Horonaim</i>, or rather the whole of the country between them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p61"></A>If you extend it to the whole nation, the meaning will be, &#8220;The Moabites have enjoyed the highest luxury, and every kind of abundance, and hitherto have suffered no distress. Hence has arisen their stubbornness, and, in order to subdue them, they must be banished and driven even to <i>Zoar</i>.&#8221; Now <i>Zoar</i> was a town very far removed from the Moabites; and, therefore, he means that they cannot provide for their safety but by 			 <i>fleeing</i> to a distance. Here all with whom the Lord deals tenderly are taught not to exalt themselves, or to provoke God by their wantonness, but to be modest even amidst the highest prosperity, and likewise to be prepared for every change, when the Lord shall be pleased to throw them down from their prosperity.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p62"></A><i>By the going up of Luhith.</i> He describes other parts of the country of Moab, and delineates the flight and mourning of that nature which should spread throughout the whole land.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p63"></A><i>By the way of Horonaim they shall raise the cry of sorrow.</i> The words which we have translated, <i>they shall raise up a cry</i>, some render, <i>they shall bruise</i> or <i>break themselves by crying</i>, and think there is a 			 transposition of the letters, and that <a name="xxii.i-p63.1"></A>&#1506; (<i>ain</i>) is doubled; and thus the root of the verb would be <a name="xxii.i-p63.2"></A>&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, (<i>ragnah</i>.) But as it made little difference in the meaning of the passage, I have 			 adhered to the commonly received opinion, that <a name="xxii.i-p63.3"></A>&#1497;&#1506;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493; (<i>yegnogneru</i>) is derived from the verb <a name="xxii.i-p63.4"></A>&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;, (<i>gnur</i>.) If it be thought better to make the verb signify <i>break</i>, the meaning will be, &#8220;There shall be a shaking, and, as it were, a <i>breaking</i> of the members of the body, when arm is dashed against arm.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xxii.i-p64"></A><a name="xxii.i-p64.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p65"></A><b>6.</b> <i>The waters of Nimrim.</i> By an exaggerated form of expression he gives a more enlarged view of this desolation. He says that <i>the</i> <i>grass is withered</i>, which takes place when God leaves any soil destitute of all 			 nourishment. <i>The waters</i> will be taken away, which probably were highly necessary for that dry and parched country; for soils of that kind produce nothing without irrigation. Though the style is exaggerated, yet nothing is stated but what is strictly true; for the Prophet did not go beyond proper bounds, but found it necessary to use bold expressions to suit the ignorance of the people, in order to inform them that a land which is deprived of the 			 blessing of God will be like a desert without any beauty.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xxii.i-p66"></A><a name="xxii.i-p66.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p67"></A><b>7.</b> <i>Therefore what every one hath left.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_243"></A><A HREF="#fn_243"><FONT SIZE="1">244</FONT></A>
 			  This corresponds to the ordinary expression, (<a name="xxii.i-p68.1"></A><i>Ce qu&#8217;il aura espargne</i>,) <i>Whatever he shall</i> <i>have spared</i>. He means the riches that are laid up, and describes what usually happens in countries which are invaded by an enemy. All the inhabitants are wont to convey their 			 riches elsewhere, and to lay them up in some safe place, that they may afterwards bring them back when peace has been restored.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p69"></A><i>To the brook of the willows.</i> He means that they will have no storehouse, no fortress in which they can lay them up with safety; so that they will be compelled to hide them among <i>the willows</i>. This certainly is the lowest wretchedness, when the enemy is attacking us, and we can find no storehouse for laying up 			 those things which we have collected with great industry. These <i>willows</i> were probably situated in some remote and sequestered place. Others explain it as referring to enemies, that they will bring the fruits of their robbery <i>to the</i> <i>brook</i>, to divide among themselves the general plunder.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xxii.i-p70"></A><a name="xxii.i-p70.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p71"></A><b>8.</b> <i>The cry is gone round about the borders of Moab.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_244"></A><A HREF="#fn_244"><FONT SIZE="1">245</FONT></A>
 			  <a name="xxii.i-p72.1"></A>&#1499;&#1497;, (<i>ki</i>,) <i>for</i>, is added for the sake of ornament. He means that every part of that country all around shall be full of <i>crying</i> and <i>howling</i>; because that destruction 			 reaches from one extremity to another. Besides the <i>crying</i> he twice mentions the <i>howling</i>, to denote the excess of grief, as men who are in despair surrender themselves entirely to lamentation.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xxii.i-p73"></A><a name="xxii.i-p73.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p74"></A><b>9.</b> <i>For the waters of Dimon shall be filled with blood.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_245"></A><A HREF="#fn_245"><FONT SIZE="1">246</FONT></A>
 			  Here he describes not only <i>grief</i> and <i>howling</i>, flight or trembling, or the covetousness of enemies in plundering their wealth, but the slaughter of men. How great must this have been, when large and magnificent rivers, such as <i>Dimon</i> was, are <i>filled with blood</i>!</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p76"></A><i>For I will lay upon Dimon additions.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_246"></A><A HREF="#fn_246"><FONT SIZE="1">247</FONT></A>
 			  By <i>additions</i> he means that the Lord, in whose name he speaks, will multiply the murders; so that the dead bodies shall be heaped up, and there shall be no end to cruelty and slaying. Now, though the Assyrians were cruel in this slaughter, yet the Lord was not cruel; for he justly punished the barbarity of the Moabites which they basely exercised towards the Jews, on whom they ought to have had compassion. It was 			 right that they should suffer the same punishment which they had inflicted on others.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xxii.i-p78"></A><i>To those who have escaped of Moab lions.</i> These also are the <i>additions</i> of which he spake, or, at least, a part of them. This may be regarded as the copestone of that calamity; so that if any detachments of the enemy attempted to escape, and to rescue themselves from the slaughter, they had to encounter 			 <i>lions</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_247"></A><A HREF="#fn_247"><FONT SIZE="1">248</FONT></A>
 			  and wild beasts, by which they were devoured. &#8220;They will, indeed,&#8221; says he, &#8220;rescue themselves from the slaughter, but they will not on that account be safe, nor will they escape the hand of God.&#8221; And this is the true meaning of the Prophet, if we carefully examine the scope of the whole passage; for he intended to deepen the picture of that distressing calamity by adding, that even the small remnant which shall be rescued from the slaughter will fall into the jaws 			 of <i>lions</i>. The hand of the Lord pursues the wicked in such a manner that they cannot in any way escape; for if they avoid one danger, they immediately meet with another. Let us remember that these things are spoken by the Prophet for the consolation of the godly, that they may fortify their minds by some promise against the cruelty of their enemies, who shall at length be destroyed, and shall nowhere find a refuge either in their gods, or in 			 fortresses, or in lurking-places, or in flight.</p>
