<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent18"><a name="iv-p5"></A>Thrice happy (England) if thou knewest thy bliss,<br> 		  Since Christ&#8217;s eternal Gospel in thee shined<br> 		  Thou art. His beetle-blind that sees not this,<br> 		  Brutishly ingrate that with a thankful mind<br> 		  Doth not acknowledge Gods great Grace herein,<br> 		  And learn thereby for to forsake his sin.</p>  		
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent18"><a name="iv-p6"></A>God&#8217;s word hath long in thee been soundly taught, <br> 		  The sound thereof hath rung throughout the Land, <br> 		  And many a Soul by Fishers net been caught, <br> 		  Which erst lay thrall in Satan&#8217;s cruel band:<br> 		  This favour great by none can be expressed,<br> 		  But such as have it felt in their own breast.</p>  		
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent18"><a name="iv-p7"></A>Thy native sons in thine own bowels bred,<br> 		  Like faithful Shepherds have done worthily,<br> 		  And thee with store of heavenly Manna fed,<br> 		  Forcing the Wolves to leave their cruelty,<br> 		  To slink aside, and hide themselves in holes,<br> 		  In caves and dells, like pur-blind Backs and Moles.</p>  		
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent18"><a name="iv-p8"></A>Tyndall, Frith, Philpot, father Latimer, <br> 		  The Gospel preached by word, by life, by death: <br> 		  Ivel, Fox, Reynolds, Fulk, and Whitaker <br> 		  To second them have spent their vital breath.<br> 		  In hot pursuit of that great Romish Bore,<br> 		  Who spoiled quite this English vine before.</p>  		
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent18"><a name="iv-p9"></A>I spare to speak of Deerings silver voice, <br> 		  Of Greenhams zeal, of Perkins labours sound, <br> 		  Of hundreds more of Zion-builders choice, <br> 		  The like whereof can scarce elsewhere be found:<br> 		  Such ground-work they of Gods truth here have placed<br> 		  As never shall by Hels whole force be razt.</p>  		
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent18"><a name="iv-p10"></A>Besides all these, of Sorrel Lights the chief,<br> 		  Beza, and Vrinus, many other more,<br> 		  Martyr, Musculus, for thy more relief<br> 		  Are seen in English weed abroad to go<br> 		  From place to place in every Shire and Torwne,<br> 		  To teach the Truth and throw all Errors down.</p>  		
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent18"><a name="iv-p11"></A>And here presented is unto thy sight<br> 		  The Royal Prophet Esaias Evangel:<br> 		  For so me thinks I may it terme aright,<br> 		  That Prince of holy Prophets doth so well,<br> 		  So likely Christ&#8217;s whole history presage,<br> 		  As if h&#8217; had lived in that same very Age.</p>  		
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent18"><a name="iv-p12"></A>Whose Oracles great Calvin doth unfold <br> 		  In thine own native Tongue for thy Souls health. <br> 		  Here maist thou gather precious Stones and Gold, <br> 		  And store up heaps of Heavenly lasting wealth;</p>  		
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent18"><a name="iv-p13"></A>Here maist thou find with very little Pain<br> 		  Which would&#8217;st not lose for thousand Worlds again.<br> 		  Here maist thou see the black-mouthed Atheists<br> 		  Confounded quite by Demonstration clear; <br> 		  The cunning Papist put unto his shifts, <br> 		  And made in his right Colours to appear;<br> 		  Here&#8217;s Christ, his Truth, and Life, thee set before,<br> 		  Heavens Gates set open wide: what would&#8217;st thou more?</p>
