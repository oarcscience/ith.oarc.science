<p><a name="xxii.i.v-p4"></A><b>2 </b>He fenced it, and gathered out the stones, <br> 				And planted it as a choice vine; <br> 				He reared a tower in the midst of it, <br> 				And built a wine-press in it: <br> 				He therefore hoped that it would yield grapes, <br> 				And it yieldeth wild grapes.</p>  			 
<p><a name="xxii.i.v-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Now then, O inhabitant of Jerusalem, <br> 				And man of Judah, <br> 				Judge ye between me and my vineyard.</p>  			 
<p><a name="xxii.i.v-p6"></A><b>4 </b>What more ought to have been done to my vineyard, <br> 				Which I have not done to it? <br> 				How did I look that it should yield grapes, <br> 				And yet it hath yielded wild grapes?</p>  			 
<p><a name="xxii.i.v-p7"></A><b>5 </b>And now come, I will shew to you <br> 				What I will do to my vineyard. <br> 				I will take away its hedge, that it may become pasture; <br> 				I will break down its wall, that it may be trodden down.</p>

<p><a name="xxii.i.v-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Verily the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, <br> 				And the men of Judah his pleasant plant. <br> 				Hence he looked for judgment, and behold oppression; <br> 				For righteousness, and behold a cry.</p>
