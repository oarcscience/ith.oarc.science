 			  in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p5"></A><b>2 </b>In the fifth day of the month, in the fifth year of the captivity of King Jehoiakim,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p6"></A><b>3 </b>The word of Jehovah came to Ezekiel, son of Buzi the priest, in the land of the Chaldreans, near the river Chebar, and the land of Jehovah was upon him there.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p7"></A><b>4 </b>And I looked, and, behold, tempestuous wind coming from the north; a great cloud, and a fire folding round itself, and a brightness was round about it; and out of the midst there was, as it were, the appearance of Hasmal in the midst of the fire.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p8"></A><b>5 </b>And in the middle of this, was the likeness of four living creatures, and their aspect was the likeness of a man:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p9"></A><b>6 </b>They had each four faces and four wings,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p10"></A><b>7 </b>Their feet were straight, and the sole of their feet like that of a calf&#8217;s foot, (or round, volume 1,) and they cast forth sparks like the appearance of polished brass:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p11"></A><b>8 </b>And they had human hands under their wings on their four sides; and they had four faces and wings.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p12"></A><b>9 </b>And each wing was connected with the next wing: when they moved they did not turn back: each animal went forward in the direction of his face.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p13"></A><b>10 </b>As to the likeness of their faces, these four had the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right side; and on the left, these four had the face of an ox and the face of an eagle.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p14"></A><b>11 </b>Their faces, then, and their wings were extended   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_296"></A><A HREF="#fn_296"><FONT SIZE="1">297</FONT></A>
 			  from above, and each wing was bound to its neighbor, and two covered their body.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p16"></A><b>12 </b>And each walked in the direction of its face; and wheresoever the spirit (or will,) proceeded, they proceeded they did not return in their course.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p17"></A><b>13 </b>As to the likeness of the living creatures, their aspect was like coals of burning fire, like the appearance of lamps passing up and down between the living creatures: and the fire was &#8216;bright, and lightning&#8217; issued from it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p18"></A><b>14 </b>And the living creatures ran and returned like lightning.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p19"></A><b>15 </b>While I was; beholding&#8217; the living creatures, behold one wheel on the earth, near each living, creature, at right angles,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_297"></A><A HREF="#fn_297"><FONT SIZE="1">298</FONT></A>
 			  at the face of each.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p21"></A><b>16 </b>The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship was like chrysolite: and they were all alike&#8217; and their appearance and their form were like one wheel within another.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p22"></A><b>17 </b>When they moved forward, they went upon their four sides: they did not turn back when they proceeded.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p23"></A><b>18 </b>And I beheld their circumferences, and their size, and their terribleness; and their strakes were full of eyes, round about these four.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p24"></A><b>19 </b>And when the living creatures walked, the wheels moved beside them; and when the living creatures were raised from the earth, the wheels were raised with them.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_298"></A><A HREF="#fn_298"><FONT SIZE="1">299</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p26"></A><b>20 </b>Withersoever the spirit led the living creatures, tither it also led the wheels: the wheels were raised up also with the living creatures, because their spirit was in the wheels also.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p27"></A><b>21 </b>When the animals moved forward, the wheels did the same: they both were stationary and both elevated together; because the spirit of the animals was in the wheels.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p28"></A><b>22 </b>Above the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of a firmament, as the appearance of terrible crystal stretched over and above their heads.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p29"></A><b>23 </b>And under the firmament their wings were straight, each towards its neighbor: and each living creature had two wings, which covered their bodies on this side and on that.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p30"></A><b>24 </b>And I heard the voice of their wings, like the voice of mighty waters, and like the voice of God&#8217; the voice of their speech was like the sound of an army when they moved forward; and when they stood, they let down their wings.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p31"></A><b>25 </b>And there was a voice from the firmament over their heads when they stood and let down their wings.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p32"></A><b>26 </b>And above the firmament over their heads was the likeness of a throne, like the vision of a sapphire stone: and above the likeness of the throne was an image like the aspect of a man upon it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p33"></A><b>27 </b>And I saw, as it were, the color of amber, like the appearance of fire round about within it: from the appearance of his loins, both upwards and downwards, I saw the aspect of fire, and a brightness all round about him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.i-p34"></A><b>28 </b>Like the appearance of a bow in a cloud on a rainy day, such was the aspect of his brightness round about. This was a vision of the similitude of Jehovah&#8217;s glory: and I gazed at it, and fell upon my face, and heard a voice speaking unto me. And he said unto me, &#8212;</p>  <a name="xi.ii"></A>

<p><a name="xi.ii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>And the Spirit came to me when he addressed me, and placed me upon my feet: and I heard him address me; and he said unto me &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.ii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, To revolting tribes who have rebelled against me: They and their fathers have acted perfidiously against me, Even to this very day.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.ii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>They are children of a hard face, and of a stiff heart. Therefore I send thee unto them; And you shall say to them &#8212; Thus says the Lord Jehovah</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.ii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will not, For they are a rebellious house, Yet shall know that a Prophet has been among them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.ii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>And you, son of man, be not afraid of them; Fear not their words, though they are rebellious, And are thorns towards time, and you dwellest with scorpions. Be not afraid of their language; Be not dismayed at their looks, Since they are a rebellious house.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.ii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>And you shall utter my words unto them, Whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; For they are rebels.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.ii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>And you, son of man, hear what I say unto thee: Be not you rebellious like that. rebellious house; Open thy mouth, and eat what I put before thee.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.ii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Then I looked up, and, behold, a hand extended to me; And lo! a roll of a book was in it:</p>

<p><a name="xi.iii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>So I opened my mouth, and he fed me with that roll.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And said to me, Son of man, Feed thy belly, and fill thy bowels with this roll which I give thee. So I ate it, and it was in my mouth Like honey for sweetness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Then he said to me, Son of man! Go to the house of Israel and address them in my words,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Since you art not sent to a people profound in lip and hard of speech, You art sent to the house of Israel:</p>

 			  Had I sent thee unto them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p10"></A><b>7 </b>But the house of Israel will not hear thee; Because they will not hear me; Since the whole house of Israel are hard of front and stout of heart.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p11"></A><b>8 </b>Lo! I have made thy face hard against their faces, And thy forehead hard, against their forehead.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p12"></A><b>9 </b>As an adamant, harder than flint, Have I made thy forehead: fear them not: Be not broken down at their presence, For they are a house of rebellion.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p13"></A><b>10 </b>Moreover, he said to me, Son of man! All my words which I shall speak to thee, Receive in your heart and hear with your ears:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p14"></A><b>11 </b>And go &#8212; Judea thee to the captives, to the children of thy people, And speak unto them and tell them, &#8212; Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Whether they will hear, or whether they will not.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p15"></A><b>12 </b>Then the Spirit raised me up: and I heard behind me A voice of mighty rustling, which said, Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place!</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p16"></A><b>13 </b>1 heard also the sound of the wings of the living&#8217; creatures, Each kissing that of its companion, And the noise of the wheels beside them &#8212; the sound of a mighty shaking.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p17"></A><b>14 </b>Then the Spirit raised me, and took me away, And I set forth in bitterness and indignation of spirit, And the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p18"></A><b>15 </b>Then I came to the captives at Thel-abib, They were seated by the river Chebar: there they sat: And I also sat there seven days desolate in the midst of them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p19"></A><b>16 </b>Then it happened at the end of the seven days, Thai the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</p>

<p><a name="xi.iii-p22"></A><b>19 </b>Yet if you warn the wicked, and he turn not from his impious and evil way, He shall die in his iniquity; But you has freed your own soul.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p23"></A><b>20 </b>If a just man shall turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity: And I put a stumbling-block before his face, he shall die: Because you has not warned him, he shall die in his sins, The righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; But his blood will I require at thy hand.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.iii-p24"></A><b>21 </b>Then if you warn the righteous that he sin not, And he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned, You also has delivered your own soul.</p>

<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref10"><a name="xi.xx-p2"></A>CHAPTER 20</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p3"></A><b>1 </b>It occurred in the seventh year, the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, Men from the elders of Israel came to consult Jehovah, And sat before my face. And the word of Jehovah</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Came to me, saying, Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And say unto there, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Are you come. to inquire of me? As I live, If I will be sought by you, saith the Lord Jehovah,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Wilt you judge them, wilt you judge them, son of man? Explain to them the abominations of their fathers;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Then you shall say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, In the day on which I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand To the seed of the house of Jacob, and was known to them in the land of Egypt, Then I raised my hand to them, saying, I am Jehovah your God:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p8"></A><b>6 </b>In that day I lifted up my hand towards them, To bring them from the land of Egypt into a land which I espied for them, Flowing with milk and honey, desirable beyond all lands.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Then I said to them, Cast you away every one the abominations of his eyes, And pollute not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I Jehovah am your God; and they rebelled against me,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p10"></A><b>8 </b>And were unwilling to hear me: they did not cast away The idols of their eyes: they did not desert the idols of Egypt: Then I said that I would pour out my wrath upon them; To fill up nay fury against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p11"></A><b>9 </b>But, I acted for my name&#8217;s sake, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations, In the midst of which they were; in whose sight I was known to them, By bringing them forth from the land of Egypt.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Then I led them out from the land of Egypt, and brought them into the desert.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p13"></A><b>11 </b>And I gave them my decrees, and made known my judgments unto them, Which if a man do, he shall live in them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Moreover I gave them my Sabbaths for a sign between me and them, That they might know that I am he who sanctifieth them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p15"></A><b>13 </b>But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the desert: They walked not in my decrees, And despised my judgments, Which if a mall do, he shall live in them. And my sabbaths they greatly violated: Then I said I would pour out my wrath in the desert to consume them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p16"></A><b>14 </b>Then I acted for my name&#8217;s sake, that it should not be profaned In the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I led them out.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p17"></A><b>15 </b>Yet I lifted up my hand to them in the desert, That I should not lead them into the land which I had given them, Flowing with milk and honey, the desire of all lands,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p18"></A><b>16 </b>Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my decrees, And polluted my sabbaths; because their heart walked after their idols.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p19"></A><b>17 </b>Then mine eye spared them, so that I did not destroy them, And did not consume them in the desert.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p20"></A><b>18 </b>Then I said unto their sons in the desert, Walk you not in the decrees of your fathers, And keep not their judgments, and pollute not yourselves with their idols:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p21"></A><b>19 </b>I Jehovah am your God, walk you in my decrees, And keep my judgments, and do them:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p22"></A><b>20 </b>And hallow my Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, That you may know that I Jehovah am your God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p23"></A><b>21 </b>Then these sons became rebels against me: They walked not in my decrees, and kept not my judgments To do them, which if a man do, he shall live in them; They profaned my Sabbaths: and I said That I would pour out my wrath upon them, To accomplish my fury against them in the desert.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p24"></A><b>22 </b>Then I withdrew my hand, and acted for my name&#8217;s sake, That it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations, Before whose sight I led them out.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p25"></A><b>23 </b>I also lifted up my hand to them in the desert To scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the lands;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p26"></A><b>24 </b>Because they did not perform my judgments, And despised my statutes, and violated my Sabbaths; And their eyes were after their fathers&#8217; idols.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p27"></A><b>25 </b>I therefore gave them decrees that were not good, And judgments by which they could not live;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p28"></A><b>26 </b>And I contaminated them in their gifts, By casting away every first-born offspring, To destroy them, that. they may know that I am Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p29"></A><b>27 </b>Wherefore, speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Hither to your fathers Have dishonored me in this by prevaricating greatly against me:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p30"></A><b>28 </b>For I introduced them into the land, for which I raised my hand to give it them; And they saw every high inn, and every branching tree: Then they sacrificed there their offerings, And offered there the irritation of their oblation, And placed there the odor of their sweet fragrance, And poured out there their libations.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p31"></A><b>29 </b>Then said I unto them, What is the high place to which you approach? For its name is called &#8220;Lofty&#8221; unto this day.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p32"></A><b>30 </b>Wherefore, say unto the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Are you polluted after the way of your fathers? And do you commit adultery after their idols?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p33"></A><b>31 </b>For in offering your gifts, and in passing your sons through the fire, You pollute yourselves in all your idols unto this day Then shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel! As I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if I shall be inquired of by you.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xi.xx-p34"></A><b>32 </b>That also which comes it to your mind shall not happen, Since you say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the lands,</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xi.i-p4"></A> The thirtieth year. The date at which this reckoning commences is doubful Calvin dates from a Jubilee, (vol. 1, p. 52.,) but Jerome from the 18th year of King Josiah, when the book of the law was found. Origen, Hom. I., understands it of Ezekiel&#8217;s age; and so does Gregory, Hom. II. Maldonatus interprets it of the captivity, and quotes the authority of Theodoret. Pradus, as 				  quoted by Rosenmfiner, agrees with Jerome. The Editor refers his readers once for all to the valuable commentary of Rosenmuller on this Prophet for all kinds of valuable critical information; while the English student will find the notes to Archbishop Newcome&#8217;s version very judicious.</p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xi.xvi-p22"></A> The meaning of this clause is doubtful. See Calvin&#8217;s Commentary,vol. 2, p. 113. Newcome very judiciously translates, &#8220;whither you shouldst not have come, neither should it have been done.&#8221;</p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xi.xix-p13"></A> Calvin translates with the authorized version <a name="xi.xix-p13.1"></A><i>in tuo sanguine</i>, &#8220;in thy blood,&#8221; and explains it as above, <a name="xi.xix-p13.2"></A><i>dum peperit</i>.

Solomon, and Rab. David, take it as 				  Calvin does. Both Rosenmuller and Newcome discuss the point with ability.</p> 			 </P>
