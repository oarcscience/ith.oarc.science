<span id="xiv.i-p1"></span>Dissertation First.

<span id="xiv.i-p2"></span>ON THE CHERUBIM.

<span id="xiv.i-p3"></span>THE Visions recorded in the first and tenth
chapters of this Prophet have received much illustration, and yet remain
involved in great obscurity. It seems desirable to supply some
information, even at the risk of being tedious and minute. The living
creatures of the first chapter are called in the ninth and tenth —
*cherubim*. The derivation of the word is a point of some importance.
Castell, in his elaborate Lex. Hept., connects it with the Chaldee root
<span id="xiv.i-p3.2"></span>כרב, *kereb*, signifying “to plough,” and
quotes <span id="xiv.i-p3.3"></span>[Eze
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010)<span id="xiv.i-p3.3"></span>,
where “an ox” occurs, “a strong animal, of great labor, especially in
ploughing; and being used for the expiation of sins, becomes a type of
Christ, who is there perhaps to be understood; for as the ox is the
leader of the herd, so Christ is the head of the faithful.” Josephus
says they were animals never seen by any one. (Antiq., lib. 3. chapter
6, and lib. 8 chapter 2.) The Arabic root of the same three letters,
*kereb*, signifies anxiety and oppressive labor, <span
id="xiv.i-p3.4"></span>*anxit animum, invertit aratio terram*; while the
cognate forms of the Syriac signify ploughing and laborious effort. “The
most probable,” says Gesenius, “among the many derivations of this word
which have been proposed, is that from the Syriac, <span
id="xiv.i-p3.5"></span>*potens magnus fortis*.” Professor Lee writes, in
evident despair, “It would be idle to offer anything on the etymology:
nothing satisfactory having yet been discovered. Castell, Simonis,
Gesenius, etc., may be consulted by those who wish to see what has been
said on this subject.” The cherubic form has been fully portrayed by our
Commentator; and by engravings in the *Cyclopcedia of Biblical
Literature* we are enabled to compare Egyptian and Persian winged
symbols with those of the Hebrews. A sculptured bas-relief of a winged
human figure as it existed before the time of Moses, and placed by the
Egyptians over their sacred arcs, is worthy of comparison with the
descriptions of Scripture. The Persian bas-relief at Moung-Aub, is a
human figure arrayed in an embroidered robe, “with such quadruple wings
as the vision of Ezekiel ascribes to the cherubim, with the addition of
ample horns, the well-known symbols of regal power.” The opinions of
divines relative to their design and signification are very diversified.
Among the ancients Philo supposed them to signify the two hemispheres,
the flaming sword showing the motion of the planets, and the lion and
the man being Leo and Aquarius, the signs of the Zodiac. Irenaeus (Adv.
Heres. 3:11) treats them as emblems of the four elements, the four
quarters of the globe, the four gospels, and the four covenants.
Tertullian (Apolog. cap. 47.) referred them to the torrid zone, while
Justin Martyr treats Ezekiel’s figures as relating to Nebuchadnezzar
eating grass like the ox, with his hand like a lion’s, and his nails
like the claws of a bird, (Quaest. et Respons. 44, page 325, edit.
Heidelbergae, 1593;) and that they were consolatory to the captive
Israelites by setting before them the prospect of their own return, and
their oppressor’s downfall. The analogy to the four gospels, as
presented to us by Irenaeus, is peculiarly ingenious, and worthy of
perusal. Spencer, in his Ritual Observances of the Hebrews, has
ingeniously explained their form and description. (*Lib.* 3. *Dissert.*
5 cap. 3. and 4 section 2.) Grotius considers them to represent “the
properties of God, and his actions towards his people,” (*Annot. in Vet.
Test*.;) and Doederlin, while conceding the praise of ingenuity to the
conjectures of his author, yet treats his speculations as the abortion
rather than the legitimate offspring of a luxuriant fancy. (Vogel’s
edit. Grot. continued by Doeder., volume 2 page 247.) Further
information as to the views of ancient writers has been collected by
Rosenmuller, on <span id="xiv.i-p3.6"></span>[Eze
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010)<span id="xiv.i-p3.6"></span>,
edit. see. Lipsiae, 1826. The translation of Houbigant may be consulted,
and Spencer on the Laws and Ritual of the Hebrews, lib. 3. Dissert. 5,
chapter 1, and folk The various readings on which different translations
are founded are rendered very accessible to the English reader by the
simple and comprehensive notes of Archbishop Newcome.

<span id="xiv.i-p4"></span>It is interesting to observe the way in which
the learned Jesuit Maldonatus comments on this first: chapter. He
interprets the four visions separately first, the tempest; next, the
figure of the four animals; the third, the form of the wheels; and the
fourth, the firmament., and the man sitting on the throne. He objects to
the allegorical interpretation of Origen and in school, and considers
that the tempest signifies the calamities which the Chaldaeans caused to
the Jews and their city. By the whirlwind, the nearness of the
calamities is pointed out; and by the north wind, its rapidity and
destructive force. Some, he says, refer it to Babylon, making it
symbolize the manners of the Chaldaeans, which were rough and
boisterous. The great cloud seems to him to signify the army of the king
of Babylon; and the fire, his wrath and fury: the surrounding brightness
is an indication of the divine majesty, and the amber color is an image
of God himself. Jerome takes the amber as a symbol of pity, since amber
has an attractive power, and by placing it in connection with the army
of the king of Babylon, it implies that God directed every event
concerning the captivity. Gregory and others interpret the amber of
Christ.

<span id="xiv.i-p5"></span>The Second Vision he considers more
difficult; he first gives the views of other interpreters, and then
brings forward his own <span id="xiv.i-p5.1"></span>*formed divino
beneficio, meditando, legendo, orando*. Origen (*Hom. 1. in Ezekiel*)
takes the four living creatures for the four affections of man’s nature:
the man representing the reasoning faculty, the lion the inflammable
passions, the ox concupiscence, and the eagle, as it soars upwards, the
divine spirit, within us. St. Ambrose (Lib. 3. <span
id="xiv.i-p5.2"></span>*de virinibus*) refers them to prudence,
fortitude, temperance, and justice. Jerome and Gregory understand them
of the four evangelists; and the details respecting the wheels, the
wings, and the sparks of fire, are consistently interpreted. Catina
Syrius refers them to the camp of Israel in the desert: the face of a
man meaning all Israel, that of a lion the tribe of Judea, that of an ox
the tribe of Levi, and that of an eagle God looking down from above, and
taking vengeance on the people. Theodoret (*Comment. in loc*.) considers
them to represent the majesty and glory of God resident in these
cherubim. It appears that in his day the opinion of Jerome was most
popular; and it was necessary to give many reasons why the four
evangelists were not signified by this vision. Philosophical
interpreters also existed, no unworthy predecessors of the German
rationalists. They supposed all things indiscriminately signified by
these representatives of animated nature, while some preferred the
changes of the events of providence to the manifestations of external
nature. His own opinion he records as follows: that the cherubim
represent four heathen kingdoms, Chaldean, Assyrian, Egyptian, and
Tyrian. He supposes them placed under the firmament, and under the
sapphire throne, to indicate the supreme power of the Almighty over all
things. The wings are the human guards by which kings protect
themselves; the hands represent human industry, strength, and labor; the
fire indicates the Spirit of God in kings; and the various motions
forwards and backwards show the changes in governments and the
perturbations of empires, all under the control of a supreme governor.
This scheme is well fortified by passages of Scripture, and has the
merit of great exactness and ingenuity.  <span
id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351)

<span id="xiv.i-p7"></span>We now turn to a very different interpreter —
Oecolampadius. His comments of this chapter is essentially spiritual. He
sees in it a representation of God judging the world through Christ. The
great truths of revelation he sees obscurely shadowed forth under carnal
and Jewish images; and he is anxious to point out the spiritual reign of
Christ as promulgated by these outward and visible representations of
God’s glory. He refers these visions, first of all, to the Jews and
their captivity; but he claims for them the office of tangibly
illustrating the abiding glory of the universal assembly of the
faithful. “The universal Church,” he says, “has three parts’ first, its
head is Hasmal, represented as an old man seated on a throne next,
animals, the just or living members, are those more perfect in the
Church, adorned with a variety of gifts’ the wheels are the weaker and
more ordinary members, which belong to the body, and form the common
herd of believers, who belong to the more solid parts of the Church,
since they are under the influence of the same Spirit, although they
have not attained that fullness of which St. Paul speaks, and have not
drunk into the peculiar and interior spirit of the Gospel.”  <span
id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352) He then confesses the great difficulty
of ascertaining the correct interpretation’ he rejects all Jewish
comments, and approves of the spiritualizing method of referring it to
the coming kingdom of Christ. The whirlwind, for instance, he asserts to
be a figure of the devastation which preceded Christ’s first coming, and
shall also signalize his second advent- the great cloud expresses God’s
judgments on the world, and the fire the process of trial through which
all things are to pass. Hasmal he regards as the name of an angel or
fiery living one speaking, and blames Jerome for following the
Septuagint, and translating it *electrum*.

<span id="xiv.i-p9"></span>This spiritually-minded reformer has
furnished a valuable exposition of the mystery contained in the vision
recorded in the tenth chapter, which is worthy of notice. The likeness
of a man upon the throne he assumes to be our Savior, whose reign is
supreme “in the consciences of his elect.” Most properly is he called
Hasmal, “<span id="xiv.i-p9.1"></span>quod de eo admirabunda
taciturnitate, et per cogitationes arcanas magnifica loquamur, opus dei
in illo admirantes.” The cherubim are beneath him, because he is adored
by angels, and has spirits for his messengers and attendants. The
firmament, he says, is grace offered through Christ, which strengthens
the hearts of the elect by being infused with in them. The living
creatures, their wheels and machinery for motion, represent the progress
of the Church, suffering as yet under corruption, but waiting and
groaning for the redemption of the body. In each living creature all
qualities are bound together; for the four faces represent the spiritual
endowments of advancing Christians; the same animal is a man in
judgment, a lion in patient endurance, a calf in usefulness and
guileless sincerity, and an eagle in prompt and cheerful obedience to
its lord the wings are faith and divine love, which veil the face, which
is conscience, and of this there are four kinds corresponding Lo the
human, the leonine, the infantile, and the aquiline appearances. “It is
the property of a good conscience to by raised upwards towards God when
confirmed in grace, and, forgetful of thing’s past to be more and more
anxious to reach the firmament of grace.” The hands under each wing
represent those good works by which living faith and active love
manifest their divine power; while the wheels signify the inferior
members of the Church, who, though not attaining to the same righteous
standard, are animated by a similar spirit. The feet being straight and
equable, and turning easily and constantly in all directions, are said
to signify the messengers of God proclaiming’ his salvation throughout
the world, and “bearing” all things to all men, that they may bring many
profitably to Christ.” The sound produced by the motion of the wings
means the fame of salvation arriving at, distant regions; and when the
Prophet hears the voice exhorting the wheels, it seems to him to say, “O
wheels, follow with alacrity the spirit of the living creature within
you; let; nothing; delay you; let nothing tear you from the fourfold
figure, which is the body of Christ; for if you cleave to this, even in
its lowest part, you shall be raised up together with it.” The motion of
each animal, in the direction of its face, signifies every Christian
acting according to his conscience; and although there are differences
of gifts, and each exercises his own independently, yet all follow one
common leader, being animated by a common spirit. Thus the companion of
Zuingle spiritualizes the passage with much consistency and at great
length, affording a singular example of the method of throwing the light
of matured Christian experience upon a scene so exclusively Jewish. To
enable us to decide whether the view of Calvin or Ecolampadius is the
correct one, we must state some general principles, which will be found
in the following section.

<span id="xiv.ii"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p1"></span>Dissertation Second.

<span id="xiv.ii-p2"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p2.1"></span>CALVINUS
JUDAIZANS AN ORTHODOXUS?

<span id="xiv.ii-p3"></span>“<span id="xiv.ii-p3.2"></span>Calvinus
Judaizans“ was the title of a work published at Wittemberg, A.D. 1595,
by AEgidius Hunnius. It contained a sharp censure for applying to the
temporal state and circumstances of the Jews those prophecies which were
supposed to refer spiritually to the Christian Church. The year,
however, did not pass away before David Pareus replied, under the title
of “<span id="xiv.ii-p3.3"></span>Calvinus Orthodoxus.” And all who have
perused his comments on this Prophet must vindicate him from the charge
of favoring Judaism, and applaud him for wisely neglecting all
allegorical significations and mystical expositions. While it will be
impossible to discuss the whole question of prophetic interpretation, it
will be necessary to state some general views by which we ought to be
guided.

<span id="xiv.ii-p4"></span>The prophecies of the Old Testament were in
many instances a divinely provided introduction to the events of the
New. In them we may see the outlines of the process by which God was
ever educating man for ultimate restoration to His image. They contain a
suggestive method of destruction by palpable signs and. wonders, which
addressed the soul through their influence on the senses. Their value to
the Jew was very different from that to the Christian. To the former
they were the highest revelation attainable, while for us they do not
reveal a single attribute or purpose of Deity which is not more fully
made known through the Gospel dispensation. The Hebrew visions stand to
us in the relation of porch to temple, and of dawn to day. They are to
the Christian a divine first lesson-book, and contain a series of
condescending instructions suited to a low stage of religious and mental
life. They were specially appropriate to the people to whom they were
bestowed, and of a structure and material in accordance with the
dispensation to which they ministered. They were prefigurative and
preformative throughout. They were preparatory and thus far excellent,
but not “chiefest of all” because not permanent. Like the scaffolding,
the growing blade, the finished portrait, they fail in comparison with
the stately building, the ripened corn, the living person. Now Calvin
avoids the extremes of the merely literal system and of the mystical
allegories of the double sense. The former system treats the Old
Testament as if it were all written at the same time, and every part of
it addressed equally to all men. It excepts the ceremonial observances,
and then considers that every sentence is reconcilable with all the rest
by a spiritual process of traditionary reasoning. It is sternly opposed
to all discrimination between the records of different eras; it admits
of nothing gradual, variable, or local. Of the latter system we have an
excellent example in the quotation just made from the comparison of
Zuingle. He sees Christ and justification by faith everywhere. Not only
must Hasmal — a mere color — be an emblem of the Son of God, but all who
cannot receive this are branded as unenlightened. The truths which he
has received through the gospel are so vividly impressed upon his soul
and so thoroughly leaven his spirit, that he sees everything scriptural
by this bright light of his inner man. His deficiency is of judgment,
not of grace. The question thought not to be, what series of Christian
doctrine can be grafted upon the cherubic emblem, but what truths it was
intended to convey to the soul of the Prophet and the people, — surely
not those of the Augsburgh Confession of Faith. We have to guard against
a twofold error: on the one hand, a merely critical and rationalistic
interpretation which never proceeds beyond the surface; and, on the
other, against a fanciful exposition of figurative language, as if in
every case the doctrines, the graces, and the experiences of the New
Covenant were intended to be revealed to Hebrew prophets.

<span id="xiv.ii-p5"></span>Apposite, indeed, was the exclamation of the
Jew, when he said of Ezekiel, “Doth he not speak parables?” He had to
take a the and draw a city upon it; to shave his head, and divide the
her into three significant parts; and the Jew might fairly ask, How is
all this to benefit his soul? It could only do so by appealing to the
spiritual principle in man’s soul. As the Prophet must eat the roll, so
we must to comprehend the meaning of divine emblems, that they may
become to us the bread of life. There is a husk around many a spiritual
fruit, and often times a stone within it, which seems devoid of
nutriment; but still this is the way in which it pleases our heavenly
Father to nourish us. All signs, emblems, and sacraments of any true
religion are beneficial to us only when we spiritually perceive their
inward and animating grace. All that is outward in form and ceremony and
machinery is only the vehicle, not the substance, of our support as
God’s children, and our growth in his likeness. This foundation truth
must be laid firmly as a basis for every portion of the superstructure.
The carnal mind never did and never can comprehend the things of the
Spirit of God. The power of understanding the meaning must come from the
same Deity who sends the vision. On this broad rock of truth we may
build every sound interpretation of all the figurative language of
Scripture. This principle we may gather from the way in which the early
Christian writers explain the symbols of Holy Writ. St. Chrysostom, for
instance, treats clearly the lesson we should learn from the seraph’s
taking the coal from the altar and touching the Prophet’s lips with its
hallowed fire.  <span id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353) St. Ambrose
seems scarcely satisfied with the image — bread of life: he must “eat
life.” “Whoso then,” says he, “eateth life cannot die. How should he die
whose food is life?”  <span id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354) “and this
bread,” he adds, “is the remission of sins.” St. Augustine speaks of
“angels feeding on the eternal word,” and of “men eating angels’ food.”
 <span id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355) Language like this implies the
struggle of the spiritual mind to express itself fully through the
medium of carnal language; and what were the Shechinnah and the
Seraphim, the Urim and the Thummim, the live goat and the slain goat,
but symbols receiving all their significance from the Divine truths
which they conveyed to the soul? The worship of the one God through the
appointed Mediator was ever the same in its hidden essence, and ever
must be, while it is ever varying in its, form, according to the divers
needs of our frail humanity. It is flexible exceedingly to the eye and
the ear, and unchangeable only in its living spirit. All nature, organic
and inorganic, has been used to illustrate it and communicate it, but
this never has made, nor can make, the unseen visible. Still the
question will recur, Where must we draw the line between the human and
the divine in these prophetic visions? No man can draw such a line with
accuracy except for himself. Let all who doubt this assertion try to
divide mind from matter in the living man. Many have attempted it, and
their failures remain to mark the narrow lib, its of their knowledge and
the assumed regions of their ignorance. The matured Christian instincts
of the cultivate worshipper will be every man’s best guide under the
promised teaching of the Holy Spirit. An infallible interpreter is not
for us in the flesh; the interpreting Spirit must dwell within us,
otherwise we shall see nothing but the outward aspect of the gorgeous
vision. The inspiration within must harmonize with that without, which
is not verbal but ideal. The heaven-wrought ideas of the Hebrew Prophets
protect themselves.

<span id="xiv.ii-p9"></span>We do not require either a verbal or literal
theopneustia: the truths themselves by their own imperishableness defeat
the mortality of the language with which they are associated. They
reverberate and percolate through all the pages of the mighty record;
they hide themselves obscurely in one chapter only to emerge more
clearly in another; they diverge in one book only to recombine in
another; so that to the sympathizing soul Scripture is ever a
self-sufficing interpreter. Hence we are not careful to defend Calvin’s
interpretations as faultless: theology as a science has advanced rapidly
during three hundred years; and while some of his expositions have
become antiquated, we still uphold him as “orthodoxus.” The law of
development operates in the moral as well as in the physical universe.
“Draw a <span id="xiv.ii-p9.1"></span>*cordon sanitaire*,” says a modern
reviewer, “against dandelion or thistle-down, and see if the armies of
earth would suffice to interrupt this process of radiation, which yet is
but the distribution of weeds. The secret implications of the truth have
escaped at a thousand points in vast arches above our heads, rising high
above the garden wall, and have sown the earth with memorials of the
mystery which they envelop.”  <span id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356)

<span id="xiv.ii-p11"></span>A second principle which we must bear in
mind is, that every prophetic revelation was expressly adapted to the
capacity of its original recipients. The extrinsic agency is always
transitory. We of later generations learn enough if we profit by the
latent and permanent essence. Hence the interpretation of the cherubim
by the four evangelists is utterly untenable: and all such suppositions
are indexes of a state of mind wholly incompetent to unfold prophetic
mysteries. The very occurrence of hundreds of crude guesses like this,
implies the necessity of submitting the prophetic emblems to some
general laws of exposition. The highest criticism and the profoundest
scholarship should be applied to them, that we may at once ignore all
traditions which are proved to be corruptions. These prophecies
presuppose a moral responsibility in the people to whom they were
addressed; and hence they were fitted to awaken this feeling when
dormant, to frighten it when morbidly perverted, and to animate it when
righteously sensitive. Calvin’s assertion that the living creatures and
the wheels imply that God by his angels guides the physical motions of
the earth, the air, and the sea, (<span id="xiv.ii-p11.1"></span>[Eze
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#021)<span id="xiv.ii-p11.1"></span>,)
is altogether untenable. Revelation does not teach anything which human
philosophy can discover. It manifests its whole aim and essence to be
moral, lying in that region of our nature which is under the sway of the
conscience, and the will rather than of the intellect. These emblematic
visions appeal to the affections and aspirations of soul, to the
energies of reverence and faith, of wonder and of love. They have to do
with what is infinite and unseen, the immeasurable and the unattainable.
Hence they are rather divine agencies for quickening, stimulating, and
directing man’s highest nature. They assist us towards attaining a true
idea of God, they show us our own insignificant vileness and littleness,
and suggest the possibility of an atonement of these two. They stir up
our attention to the threatenings and the promises of an Invisible
Person, which can influence us only by being believed, and enforce the
commands of ineffable wisdom, which can benefit us only by being obeyed.
They present to our thoughts the idea of condescending mediation, the
infinitely holy condescending to purify and to abide with the morally
unclean. They may further imply the general providence over the chosen
race, as well as the special guidance of individuals; the molding into
its preordained shape all their future history, and yet not sensibly
controlling the will of agents left responsible for their every action.
No discoveries of science can ever interfere with such an interpretation
as this, and those who adopt it need never fear the necessity for
changing it when the progress of physical knowledge must lead us to
alter our views of other interpretations. It, belongs to a region of our
nature completely separable from that which comprehends either the
niceties of language, or the laws of the physical universe. There is a
wide gulf, deep and impassable, between the moral and the intellectual
departments of our nature. The imperfect state of physical science at
the time of the Reformation is a sufficient apology for the mistakes of
reformers; but their ignorance is not pardonable in us. We need not
Judaize, and yet we may be apt scholars in all Hebrew lore, and orthodox
interpreters of the Sacred Word of the Most high.

<span id="xiv.iii-p1"></span>Dissertation Third.

<span id="xiv.iii-p2"></span>CALVIN’S SEVERITY TOWARDS THE JEWS.

<span id="xiv.iii-p3"></span>IN addition to the charge of Judaizing, our
author has been accused of dwelling too copiously on our Prophet’s
severity towards the Jews. And if we can read the signs of the times in
modern publications, there is reason to fear that various delusions are
abroad on this subject. There are those who treat the Jews as in the
present day, so peculiarly favored by God, that they invest them with
the halo of a special sanctity. Reverencing as Christians thought the
designs of the Almighty in past ages, they entertain far too exalted
ideas of the personal holiness of the agents by whom those designs were
accomplished. Old Testament characters are too often treated as
“saints,” when they have few moral or religious qualities which entitle
them to that sacred appellation. And regarding the people as a body, it
is scarcely possible to find anywhere worse specimens of moral culture.
If we estimate responsibility according to the amount of light and
guidance and privilege, then, indeed, Tyre and Sidon were far less
culpable than Hebron and Jerusalem. How opposite, for instance, is their
history to what might have been expected from reading the book of
Deuteronomy. Instead of binding their written law “as frontlets between
their eyes,” no ancient nation were so careless of its sacred books. The
Hindus cling tenaciously to their shasters, while Israel utterly
neglected their Mosaic code. One would have supposed that they would
have been superstitiously careful of the five books of their inspired
leaders. Why should they not have multiplied copies of them? Why not
have constituted the Levites the authorized guardians and expounders of
them? From the time of Joshua to David there is no notice of the
existence of any sacred books which now belong to us: and more than
this, reference is made to other records not now existing. And after
Solomon’s temple was solemnly dedicated, how soon ten of the tribes
relapsed into the grossest idolatry; and even in Judea, how remarkable
is the occurrence in Josiah’s time. The very priests seem to have been
ignorant of the existence of a written copy of the law. The unexpected
discovery of one has such an effect upon the king and the people, that
it led to a thorough restoration of the national worship; and you, we
find a command that every king should write for himself a copy of the
law from that preserved by the priests. Both kings and priests seem to
have neglected their duty; and even the prophets do not charge them with
this crime among others. The loss of the original autographs is never
mentioned; nor have we the slightest hint of what became of the second
original of the two stone-tables. During the short period of their
captivity they lost their spoken language and the characters in which it
was written, so that on their return they were obliged to read Hebrew
through an interpreter. Was not this an unmatched instance of want of
reverence for the will of Jehovah? When a nation could act with such
deliberate carelessness and irreverence in various epochs, can we be
surprised at their falling into the grossest depths of immoral
profanity? When the divine records have been thus despised, all folly
and all wickedness is possible for such a people, and both are generated
with a fearful rapidity. How different, then, is their real history from
what one might expect of a people chosen by the Almighty as his earthly
representatives of religion before the heathen! They were miraculously
trained to typify and receive the Messiah, and yet they constantly
appear to be frustrating the very purpose of their choice. If we speak
of the mass of the nation, they seem in every respect to have thrown
away their privileges, and to have sudiously incurred God’s anger, and
to have determined to brave his vengeance. Under such a view of the
ancient people, no language of Calvin’s can be too strong; and it is
only to obviate the consequences of modern erroneous suppositions that
it becomes necessary to defend him. In stimulating the compassion of the
Christian Church towards the salvation of Jews at present existing, the
most fallacious views are sometimes presented of their past history and
their loveliness in God’s sight. To be beloved for their fathers’ sake
by no means implies ally innate moral loveliness in the conduct of those
fathers; and every erroneous view of Jewish history, and every false
interpretation of Jewish prophecy, does but Judaize the Christian
Church, and prevent it from going onwards to perfection, by keeping it
in trammels to either exploded prejudices or to unwise innovations.
False views of the Jewish history are now so very common, that they
naturally create a distaste for that emphatic condemnation of their
conduct which prevails through these Lectures.

<span id="xiv.iv"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p1"></span>Dissertation Fourth.

<span id="xiv.iv-p2"></span>ON THE FIGURATIVE EXPRESSIONS OF EZEKIEL.

<span id="xiv.iv-p3"></span>THE most cursory observers of Ezekiel’s
peculiarities must notice the highly figurative character of his
visions. The princes of Israel are whelps, their mother a lioness. A
great eagle comes down with one fell swoop upon the mountains of
Lebanon, and plucks off the topmost boughs of its lofty cedars. Here we
have to connect what logicians call the <span
id="xiv.iv-p3.2"></span>protasis with the <span
id="xiv.iv-p3.3"></span>Apodosis, and out of the sensible similitude to
ascertain the mystical explanation. The canon laid down by Glasse is of
constant utility: — “<span id="xiv.iv-p3.4"></span>In parabolis, si
integre accipiantur, tria, sunt: *radix, cortex*, et *medulla* sive
*fructus. Radix* est scopus in quem tendit parabola. *Cortex* est
similitudo sensibilis, quae adhibetur, et suo sensu literali constat.
*Medulla* seu fructus est sensus parabolae mysticus, seu ipsa res ad
quam parabolae fit accommodatio, seu quae per similitudinem propositam
significatur.” Philologia Sacra, lib. 2 pars. 1 tr. 2, sect. 5, canon 3:
Lipsiae, 1725. It only is it necessary to ascertain the literal meaning
of the figurative expression, but we must always proceed one step
farther before we can profi, by the metaphor. The medulla — the res ipsa
— is still to be discovered, and this alone it is which brings profit to
the soul. We must not only comprehend the figure and its literal
interpretation, but we must take one step beyond this, and comprehend
what divines call the mystical sense. We may attain to the “science of
correspondences” without adopting the fancies of Emmanuel Swedenborg;
but what he diligently and erroneously thought we must endeavor to find.
With VanMildert, in his Bampton Lectures, we use the word mystical in
its true and classical rather than in its present and popular meaning;
and though we have no special affection for the word: we contend
earnestly with the lecturer for the idea which it expresses. This inner
sense will not, from its very nature, be crippled by the details of the
natural allegory. The very essence of spiritual thought is mobility and
indefiniteness. The great master of Roman eloquence has wisely observed
— “<span id="xiv.iv-p3.5"></span>Non enim res tota toti rei necesse est
similis sit: sed ad ipsum, ad quod conferetur, similitudinem habeat,
oportet.”  <span id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357) The same idea is
expressed by Saurin in his Historical Discourses — “<span
id="xiv.iv-p4.1"></span>Non seulement il n’est pas necessaire que chacun
de leur membres ait une veu particuliere, qui se rapporte directement au
but de celui qui la propose: il faut meme que ce but soit en quelque
sort cache sous des images etrangeres destinees a l’enveloper.”  <span
id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358) As the correct elucidation of these
points is of the greatest importance, every light which can be thrown on
them has its value. Bishop Warburton, for instance, in the midst of his
elaborate and in-digested paradoxes, is led to discuss the nature of
types and symbols, visions and figures, and he treats them with
clearness, precision, and ability. He lays the foundation for their use
in the compound nature of man. He shows how the Egyptians, Mexicans, and
Chinese, communicated ideas through the senses by signs, hieroglyphics,
and picture-writing of all kinds. He quotes <span
id="xiv.iv-p5.1"></span>[Eze 31](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#000)<span
id="xiv.iv-p5.1"></span> as a striking instance of well-applied
metaphor: “for men,” says he, “so conversant in matters, still wanted
sensible images to convey abstract ideas.”  <span
id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359) He adduces <span
id="xiv.iv-p6.1"></span>[Eze 24](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#000)<span
id="xiv.iv-p6.1"></span>, as an instance of a parable purposely used “to
throw obscurity over the information,” just as the tropical hieroglyphic
was turned into the tropical symbol. He treats the “dark saying” of
<span id="xiv.iv-p6.2"></span>[Eze
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#002)<span id="xiv.iv-p6.2"></span>, as
a riddle more involved than a parable; “for the nature of God’s
dispensations required enigmas, and the genius of those times made them
natural.” The course of his argument leads him to comment at full length
on the celebrated vision of the dry bones in <span
id="xiv.iv-p6.3"></span>[Eze 37](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#000)<span
id="xiv.iv-p6.3"></span>,  <span id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360) and
to discuss the logical value of the assertion, “All words that are used
in a figurative sense must be first understood in a literal.” Perhaps it
may be better to say, All figures of speech are intended to convey to
the mind an image of something real, and they are useless to us unless
we thus apprehend their literal meaning. But Warburton did not see the
next step in the process of deriving spiritual destruction from the
visions of the Holy Spirit of God. He was not spiritually enlightened,
and failed to do more than expound the letter of Scripture. We need,
besides this, the divine teaching of the Holy Spirit, that we may
apprehend what Bishop Van Mildert calls, in his celebrated Bampton
Lectures, *the mystical sense*. “The importance” says Bishop Horne, in
his preface to the Psalms, “of the mystical interpretation can hardly be
called in question;” “without it, the spirit and power of many passages
will almost wholly evaporate.” The learned Rambach, in his Sacred
Hermeneutics, (page 81,) has adduced several instances in confirmation
of these observations. The spiritual man only can thus pierce through
the letter, and grasp the very marrow of God’s word: the carnal mind is
in this respect utterly blind, for these things are only spiritually
discerned. The word *mystical* may seem fanatical to some, but, taken in
its scholastic sense, it is easily appreciable by all who know anything
of profound criticism. Rambach has justly laid it down — “<span
id="xiv.iv-p7.1"></span>Est regula theologorum, sensum mysticum non esse
argumentativum.” (Just. Hem. Sac., p. 72.) It appeals not so much to the
intellect as to the conscience, not to the mental comprehension, but to
the heaven-born life of the soul; and if this be wanting, all argument
on the point is thrown away. The spiritual interpretation may be abused,
like all other good things. Cocceius, for instance, affords a remarkable
instance of this error, as well as some of the Puritan Divines; but no
sensible man denies the value of a possession because some are foolish
enough to misuse it.  <span id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361)

<span id="xiv.iv-p9"></span>On all sides we have to tread with the
utmost caution, and may well listen to the voice of Jerome on <span
id="xiv.iv-p9.1"></span>[Galatians
1](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#000)<span id="xiv.iv-p9.1"></span>.
“<span id="xiv.iv-p9.2"></span>Nec putemus in verbis Scripturarum esse
Evangelium, sed in sensu. Non in superficie, sed in medulla: non in
sermonum foliis, sed in radice rationis.” But even this view, truthful
as it seems, may be abused; for in our own day we find the
anti-materialism of the universe denied. Who would suppose, that at the
close of the first half of this nineteenth century we should hear of a
publication, bearing’ the ominous title, “The Anti-Materialist: Denying
the reality of Matter, and Vindicating’ the Universality of Spirit?”
 <span id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362) If this were the whole title,
it would not concern us here; but when it is added, “proved chiefly by a
reference to Holy Writ,” with another sentence, implying that such
speculations can settle the points in dispute between those who affirm
and those who deny the orthodoxy of Established Churches, such
assumptions cause us to sigh over the endless follies of our nature.
Such reasoners first of all assume *what is* Holy Writ., and then apply
their own previously-conceived notions to distort and derange it. The
very title of such a work implies the greatest possible irreverence for
the Divine Oracles; the most unjustifiable assumptions, and the most
unfair contrasts. “The universality of spirit” is strictly and
essentially co-existent with “the reality of matter.” Every word which
we have uttered in this short epilogue is intended to uphold and
illustrate such a proposition’ it is only necessary to append to it,
that through material existences — as trees, cities, food, and clothing
— we become capable of comprehending the wants, the nourishment, and the
nature of our spiritual manhood. Suitable in every respect; is the
judicious reasoning of Origen, which sixteen centuries have rather
confirmed than confuted. “If ever, in reading Holy Scripture, you
encounter an idea which becomes to thee a stone of stumbling or a rock
of offense, accuse only thyself: doubt not that this stone of stumbling
and rock of offense has an important meaning: <span
id="xiv.iv-p10.1"></span>νοήματα — food for thy mind. Begin by
believing, and you shall soon find, under this imaginary source of
offense, abundant utility.” He then compares the skillful interpreter of
Scripture to an intelligent botanist, knowing the different uses and
properties of various plants, and shows how every “holy and spiritual
botanist of the word of God” will find the virtue of the word, without
esteeming the slightest portion of it either redundant or superfluous.
 <span id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363) The preceding Lectures are a
good illustration of the sagacious wisdom of these remarks.

<span id="xiv.v"></span>

<span id="xiv.v-p1"></span>Dissertation Fifth

<span id="xiv.v-p2"></span><span id="xiv.v-p2.1"></span>α. ON EATING THE
ROLL.

<span id="xiv.v-p3"></span>Chapter 3:1

<span id="xiv.v-p4"></span>This method of conveying destruction is
peculiarly Oriental. Jarchi, for instance, writes*: “*<span
id="xiv.v-p4.2"></span>*Parabolica est locutio, ac si dicat: attende
aurem tuam et audi*.” The Septuagint translate, <span
id="xiv.v-p4.3"></span>מגלת-ספר, *megleth-sepher*, *volumen libri* by
<span id="xiv.v-p4.4"></span>λις βιβλίου, which does not seem
sufficiently accurate. Both Fuller, in his *Miscell*. S.S., book 2nd,
chapter 10, and Vossius *de Sept. Int*. agree with Jerome in remarking
the inaccuracy. <span id="xiv.v-p4.5"></span>*Pro involuto libro*, he
says, 70 *capitulum libri* transrulerunt; capitulum intelligamus
exordium. The opinion of J. H. Maii, Jun., is preferred by Rosenmuller,
viz., that, <span id="xiv.v-p4.6"></span>מנלה, *menleh*, signifies the
roller on which the volumes of the Ancients were rolled, as we learn
from Maimonides, in his <span id="xiv.v-p4.7"></span>ספר תורה,
*sepher-toreh*, chapter 9:2, 14. The writing on both sides was very
uncommon the Greeks call it <span id="xiv.v-p4.8"></span>ὀπισθόγραφον,
which is illustrated by Juvenal, Sat. 1:5, 6.

<span id="xiv.v-p5"></span>— <span id="xiv.v-p5.1"></span>*aut summi
plene jam margine libri  
Scriptus, et in tergo, necdum finitus Orestes?*

<span id="xiv.v-p6"></span>The Chaldee paraphrast explains the sense of
eating the roll correctly — “anima tua saturabitur;” and in this way the
Prophet was to be strengthened to become literally “firm of forehead,
and hard of heart,” for contending with “peoples deep of lip and heavy
of tongue.” This firmness is represented by the gem, <span
id="xiv.v-p6.1"></span>שמיר, *shemir*, which Bochart terms smiris,
adamant according to Jerome, since the corresponding Arabic word is
*samoor*. See also Schindler’s Lex. Pentag. col. 1897, and R. Sal.
Jarchi in loc., who gives the view of the Jerusalem Targum.

<span id="xiv.v-p7"></span><span id="xiv.v-p7.1"></span>β. THE GREAT
RUSHING.

<span id="xiv.v-p8"></span><span id="xiv.v-p8.1"></span>[Eze
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#012)<span id="xiv.v-p8.1"></span>.

<span id="xiv.v-p9"></span>The physical disturbances accompanying the
prophetic visions are worthy of notice. It is impossible to reduce them
to any class of natural phenomena. The Prophet is suddenly removed by
the Spirit into the midst of the exiles; <span
id="xiv.v-p9.2"></span>*in extasi*, says Rosenmuller — “the mind was
separated from the body by a divine instinct.” Oecolampadius considers
that he seemed to be seized as by a wind,” and “thought he heard the
voice of a great tumult” “The glory of the Lord,” he adds, “came out of
its place, and left the temple and the people,” “and the Church and
heavenly Jerusalem praise the Lord for this act of his grace.” He then
comments most spiritually on this removal of the visible glory from the
natural temple, taking it as an instance of <span
id="xiv.v-p9.3"></span>*populus credentium*, being at all times <span
id="xiv.v-p9.4"></span>*locus Dei*. Maldonatus takes the same view when
he writes, “I seemed to be seized by the Spirit, or an angel, and. to be
transferred to Jerusalem.” He considers it too Rabbinical to treat the
Spirit as if it were merely wind, and the voice only thunder, as R.
David and Jonathan do. tie prefers the opinion of Jerome to that of the
Jewish interpreters. R. Sal. Jarchi implies that the Spirit really
raised him: “<span id="xiv.v-p9.5"></span>Deus praecepit Spiritui ut eum
portaret ad locum ubi Judaei exules degebant.” As to the last word in
this verse, <span id="xiv.v-p9.6"></span>ממקומו, *memkomo*, it seems to
refer to the place where the vision was seen: <span
id="xiv.v-p9.7"></span>scil. personent ejus laudes per mundum universum,
uti <span id="xiv.v-p9.8"></span>[Mal
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#005)<span id="xiv.v-p9.8"></span>. If
the whole scene is treated simply as a vision offered to the Prophet’s
mind through his senses, it becomes very intelligible and impressive.

<span id="xiv.v-p10"></span><span id="xiv.v-p10.1"></span>γ ON TEL-ABIB.

<span id="xiv.v-p11"></span><span id="xiv.v-p11.1"></span>[Eze
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#015)<span id="xiv.v-p11.1"></span>.

<span id="xiv.v-p12"></span>We notice these words simply to caution the
reader against over-allegorizing. There can be no doubt that it is the
name of a place; as, <span id="xiv.v-p12.2"></span>תל חרשא, *tel
chersha*, and <span id="xiv.v-p12.3"></span>תל מלח, *tel melech*, in
Ezra and Nehemiah. Syrian villages often have the name of *tel*, which
simply means inn or mountain. Burckhardt (Travels in Syria, p. 149)
observes this: but Jerome and Cocceius, who adopt the allegorizing
system, are not content with this. The former takes the words for “a
heap of new fruits,” which is symbolical of the state of the Israelites:
the latter translates “the time of new fruit;” both interpretations
being systematically erroneous. As the Chebar runs into the Euphrates
from Mount Masius, the captives were situated up the river to the north
of Babylon. A various reading, too, in this verse has been the source of
some perplexity. The common text (*chetib*) has <span
id="xiv.v-p12.4"></span>ואשר, *vasher*, derived from, <span
id="xiv.v-p12.5"></span>שרא*, shera,* <span
id="xiv.v-p12.6"></span>*habitavit, commoratus est*; but some MSS. adopt
<span id="xiv.v-p12.7"></span>ואשב, *vasheb*, “and I sat” (*keri*);
according to Kennicott and De Rossi, “<span
id="xiv.v-p12.8"></span>etiam Hispanici, Soncinensis Bibliorum editio,
Brixiensis et Complutensis.” The Septuagint adopts the former reading;
and Vogel, in his edit. of Capell. Crit. Sac., page 231, adopts the
latter. The sense will then be, “And I dwelt, since they dwelt there, I
even dwelt.” Both Dathe and Rosenmuller reject this, and agree with
Calvin’s version. His critique on the word <span
id="xiv.v-p12.9"></span>שמם, *shemem*, <span
id="xiv.v-p12.10"></span>[Eze
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#015)<span id="xiv.v-p12.10"></span>,
is quite in accordance with the English version, and with foreign
comments. Newcome paraphrases thus: “Astonished at the commission with
which I was entrusted; and affected by the overpowering splendor of the
visions.” The Chaldee has <span id="xiv.v-p12.11"></span>שתק, *shethek*,
“silent.” Maldonatus adds, “so that I could not speak for seven days.”

<span id="xiv.vi"></span>

<span id="xiv.vi-p1"></span>Dissertation Sixth.

<span id="xiv.vi-p2"></span><span id="xiv.vi-p2.1"></span>α JERUSALEM
PAINTED ON A BRICK.

<span id="xiv.vi-p3"></span><span id="xiv.vi-p3.1"></span>[Eze
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001)<span id="xiv.vi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.vi-p4"></span>Bishop Warburton (book 4 section 4 of his
*Divine Legation*) has ably discussed the Oriental and Egyptian methods
of symbolical writing. He explains Ezekiel’s method of hieroglyphics,
volume 2, page 57, edit. 1837. Oecolampadius comments very practically
on this exercise of the *ars* <span id="xiv.vi-p4.2"></span>σκιογραφίκη.
“The Church is besieged by its enemies, because it is a despiser of
God’s word. Heretics erect the towers of human traditions, and oppose
the tower and doctrine of David, since it is not defended by any shield.
They set up human righteousness, and are not subject to that of God.”
The whole passage is worthy of perusal, and is in striking contrast with
the sober and unimaginative comment of Calvin. The custom of writing on
bricks is thus noticed by Pliny: “Epigenes informs us that the
Babylonians had inscribed their observations on the stars for 720 years
on burnt bricks, <span id="xiv.vi-p4.3"></span>*coctilibus laterculis*.”
Hist. Nat., book 8 section 57. The chief point of interest in this
narrative is its visionary character. The best commentators agree that
none of these actions were real the lying on the left side for 390 days
was only in a vision. the left hand is supposed to refer to the ten
tribes, as Samaria was situated to the left of Jerusalem. In the 4th
verse, “you shall bear the punishment of their iniquity,” is correctly
interpreted by Newcome, “you shall presignify the punishment which they
shall bear.” This is the only sense which similar passages can have —
St. Paul having shown us, that the picture-writing of the Jewish law had
its real fulfillment in the work of Messiah.

<span id="xiv.vi-p5"></span><span id="xiv.vi-p5.1"></span>β THE THREE
HUNDRED AND NINETY DAYS.

<span id="xiv.vi-p6"></span><span id="xiv.vi-p6.1"></span>[Eze
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#005)<span id="xiv.vi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.vi-p7"></span>There is a difference in the number of days
between the Hebrew text and that of the Septuagint. The latter assigns
but 190 days to the kingdom of Israel, and yet agrees with the Hebrew in
assigning forty days to the kingdom of Judea. Theodoret, in his comment
on the passage, explains the Septuagint as follows. Although in the
reign of Rehoboam the people were divided, yet they are considered as
one nation, being separate, and yet conjoined. When, therefore, the
Prophet had assigned 150 days to Israel and 40 to Judea, he combines
them again, and makes 190 days. These forty days represent the forty
years which remained of the original seventy. Thirty years of captivity
were now passed for Ezekiel began to prophesy in the thirtieth year of
the captivity; and Jeremiah shows us, that in the thirty-seventh year of
the captivity of Jeconiah, Evilad-marodach raised his head and led him
from his prison-house in the first year of his reign. Then came
Baltasar, and Darius the Mede; whence the forty days of Judea signify
the forty remaining years and the 150 concerning Israel indicate the 150
years after the building of the city, and its becoming fined with
inhabitants. This happened in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, the son
of Xerxes, in the time of Nehemiah. Beginning, then, at the fifth year
of Jeconiah’s captivity, we shall find it forty years to the first year
of Cyrus the Persian, then twenty-nine years for the reign of Cyrus,
seven for Cambyses, thirty-five for Darius Hystaspes, twenty for Xerxes,
and nineteen for Artaxerxes, since in the next year the walls were
built. The Israelites participated in this return for though formerly
destined from the tribe of Judea, they were afterwards united, and all
inhabited their common metropolis together.

<span id="xiv.vi-p8"></span>Jerome also notices this difference of
numbering, being surprised that the common reading in his day was 190
years; while the Hebrew text, and Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, all
read 390 years, and even those copies of the Septuagint which are not,
vitiated. Some, he adds, compute it from the baptism of our Savior to
the end of the world; others again from the destruction of Jerusalem, in
the reign of Vespasian, to a period of prosperity for the once favored
nation. The events of history have shown the fallacy of these
computations. Ephrem, in his comments on this passage, speaks of the 430
years as beginning with the reign of Solomon, and as extending to the
eleventh year of King Zedekiah. Jerome’s method of computing this period
is worthy of notice. He dates its commencement from the reign of Pekah,
the son of Remaliah, (<span id="xiv.vi-p8.1"></span>[2Ki
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029)<span id="xiv.vi-p8.1"></span>,)
and its close during the reign of Artaxerxes Mnemon, who is the
Ahasuerus of the book of Esther. He reckons the length of the reign of
each thing in succession, and satisfies himself that he has computed the
number which he finds it the prophets, since he reckons this historical
period to consist of 389 years and four months. The sleeping on the
right side for forty days he interprets, from Nebuchadnezzar’s carrying
away Jehoiakim to Babylon, to the first, year of the sway of Cyrus,
under whom the Jews obtained their freedom. The writers on Biblical
Chronology do not acquiesce in this computation. J. G. Frank commences
the period with the revolt under Jeroboam, and concludes it with the
destruction of Solomon’s temple. Jeroboam’s first year agrees with the
year 3215 of the Jubilee period, and the destruction of the kingdom of
Israel in 3470. “If, therefore,” says he, “you add 390 years to 3214,
the date of Jeroboam’s revolt, you will obtain 3604 Jub. per.,
corresponding to the destruction of Solomon’s temple.”  <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364)

<span id="xiv.vi-p10"></span>The Hebrew commentators, R. Solomon and
David, do not suppose that a time of punishment for sin is represented,
but the time during which it was committed, and so they date the
beginning of the period during the early judges, and close it in the
reign of Hosea. (Ecolampadius adopts this comment with approval, but
Maldonatus pronounces it to be erroneous, “for the Prophet is not
speaking of their sins, but of their punishment.” Grotius supposes it to
represent the time of God’s patient endurance of the sins of the people.
The settlement of this question depends upon the use of the phrase <span
id="xiv.vi-p10.1"></span>נשא עון, *nasa ghon*, to bear iniquity, or the
punishment of iniquity. The word is used in both senses; it occurs in
<span id="xiv.vi-p10.2"></span>[Ge
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#013)<span id="xiv.vi-p10.2"></span>,
and <span id="xiv.vi-p10.3"></span>[Ge
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#015)<span id="xiv.vi-p10.3"></span>;
<span id="xiv.vi-p10.4"></span>[Ps
69:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#027)<span id="xiv.vi-p10.4"></span>,
where the authorized version and the marginal readings imply that our
translators were aware of the twofold use of the word. The idea of
“punishment” seems most suitable here; and the adoption of this
translation would cause us to neglect the Jewish interpretation, and to
count the years forward from the times of Ezekiel, and to seek for the
fulfillment of the prophecy in those events of Israel’s history which
were then future.

<span id="xiv.vii-p1"></span>Dissertation Seventh.

<span id="xiv.vii-p2"></span>THE SEPTUAGINT ORDER.

<span id="xiv.vii-p3"></span><span id="xiv.vii-p3.1"></span>[Eze
7:3-13](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#003)<span id="xiv.vii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.vii-p4"></span>These verses are much confused in the
Septuagint, and this seems to have been the case in Jerome’s time. The
Greek Codexes of the Alexandrian version do not agree, as we find from
Theodoret and the Arabic version. Theodoret and the Chaldee paraphrast
follow the Hebrew order; and the latter, from <span
id="xiv.vii-p4.2"></span>גיני, *gnini*, “my eye,” puts <span
id="xiv.vii-p4.3"></span>מימרי, *mimri*, “my word,” for the sake of
avoiding “these anthropomorphic phrases.” The thirteenth verse evidently
refers to the year of jubilee. Both Theodoret and the Vulgate translate
correctly, and Jerome explains it satisfactorily. There is a difference
in reading between the Hebrew and the Septuagint here also; the last
clause is sufficiently important to note these differences. Jerome
explains it thus’ “<span id="xiv.vii-p4.4"></span>Non proderit homini
iniquitas sua, nec ei praebebit aliquam similitudinem.” The translation
of the Syriac is, “<span id="xiv.vii-p4.5"></span>et vir iniquitate sua
non conservabit vitam suam;” and of the Chaldee paraphrast, “<span
id="xiv.vii-p4.6"></span>quisque sibi in peccatis suis sibi placet, et
dum viri permanent, poenitentiam non apprehendent.” The Syriac reading
makes the sense as follows: “Neither shall any strengthen his life by
his iniquity.”

<span id="xiv.viii-p1"></span>Dissertation Eighth.

<span id="xiv.viii-p2"></span>THE IMAGE OF JEALOUSY.

<span id="xiv.viii-p3"></span>**Ezekiel** **8:1-14**

<span id="xiv.viii-p4"></span>THE singularity of the Vision of this
chapter renders it worthy of special notice. It illustrates very
strikingly the difference between the worship of Judaism and of the
Gospel. The contrast is so remarkable, that every inference from it
respecting Christian obligation must be most indirect. These “visions of
God” occurred to the Prophet in the place of his captivity. Jerusalem
and its temple, and its chambers of imagery, are all brought rapidly
before his mind. Theodoret and Jerome maintain that the Prophet was not
removed to Jerusalem, but that the scene was presented to his mind in a
trance. Newcome continues the trance to the twenty-fourth verse of
chapter 11, <span id="xiv.viii-p4.2"></span>[Eze
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#024)<span id="xiv.viii-p4.2"></span>.
The appearance of fire in the second verse (<span
id="xiv.viii-p4.3"></span>[Eze
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#002)<span id="xiv.viii-p4.3"></span>)
is supposed by some to be better changed to “man,” by reading <span
id="xiv.viii-p4.4"></span>איש, *aish*, for <span
id="xiv.viii-p4.5"></span>אש, *eesh*, with various codexes of the
Septuagint, the Complutensian edition of the Arabic version; but, in the
second clause, <span id="xiv.viii-p4.6"></span>זהר, *zohar,* signifies
the brightness of a star, just as zoharat, in Arabic and Amharic, means
the planet Venus. In the Complutensian and Aldine editions of the
Septuagint it is translated “breeze,” or “light air,” according to the
view of Theodotion. The best translation seems to be, to take the first
clause as “the appearance of a man,” and the second as “the appearance
of brightness.”

<span id="xiv.viii-p5"></span>This remarkable vision is a singular
instance of the manner in which the Almighty instructed his prophets.
The sixth year of (<span id="xiv.viii-p5.1"></span>[Eze
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001)<span id="xiv.viii-p5.1"></span>)
is to be understood of the reign of Jeconiah. “The appearance of fire”
thought most probably to be “of a man;” (<span
id="xiv.viii-p5.2"></span>[Eze
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#002)<span id="xiv.viii-p5.2"></span>)
for <span id="xiv.viii-p5.3"></span>אש, *ash*, “fire,” may have been
substituted for, <span id="xiv.viii-p5.4"></span>אוש, *aish*, “a man.”
The Septuagint, Theodoret, the Complutensian and Arabic versions, all
take it so; but the De Rossi does not find it in any of the codexes; and
only one of Kennicott’s (No. 89) has <span
id="xiv.viii-p5.5"></span>אוש, *aish*. Still the best, modern critics
prefer it. <span id="xiv.viii-p5.6"></span>[Eze
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003)<span id="xiv.viii-p5.6"></span>.
When the Prophet is taken by a lock of his hair, Kimchi supposes it to
signify the violence by which the exiles of Judea would be treated; but
all modern writers suppose that this was only a vision: <span
id="xiv.viii-p5.7"></span>οὐ τοίνυν σωματικὴ ἦν μετάθεσις οὐδὲ τῶν τὢς
σαρκὸς ὀφθαλμῶν ἡ Θεωρία “there was no bodily change of place, nor any
real view by the eyes of the flesh,” says Theodoret. The first object
presented to the visionary eye of the Prophet was an idolatrous image,
metaphorically denominated “jealousy,” from the provocation which the
idolatries of the people occasioned. The derivation of the word “Tammuz”
(<span id="xiv.viii-p5.8"></span>[Eze
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014)<span id="xiv.viii-p5.8"></span>)
is obscure. It is supposed to refer to Adonis, as worshipped by the
Syrians. Lucian de Dea, Syria, volume 3, and Maerobii Saturnalia,
chapter 21., illustrate this point; but what “The Image of Jealousy,”
which rivaled Jehovah and provoked his anger, really was, cannot be
determined; most probably it was a statue of Moloch or Baal. Selden “on
the Syrian Deities” enters at large on the subject.  <span
id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365) The whole of this scenery Bishop
Warburton pronounces to be Egyptian, and versed as he was in Egyptian
antiquities, his judgment is deserving of notice. “They contain.” says
he, “a very lively and circumstantial description of the so celebrated
mysteries of His and Osiris.”  <span id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366)
The rites were celebrated in a subterraneous place by the Sanhedrim or
elders of Israel, and the paintings on the wall correspond with the
descriptions of the mystic cells of Egypt. The woman “weeping for
Tammuz” (<span id="xiv.viii-p7.1"></span>[Eze
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#013)<span id="xiv.viii-p7.1"></span>)
he treats as a Phoenician superstition, while the worship of “the sun
towards the east” (<span id="xiv.viii-p7.2"></span>[Eze
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#015)<span id="xiv.viii-p7.2"></span>)
is a Persian custom. “When the Prophet is bid to turn from the Egyptian
to the Phoenician rites, he is then said to look towards the north,
which was the situation of Phoenicia witch regard to Jerusalem
consequently, he before stood southward, the situation of Egypt with
regard to the same place. And when from thence he is bid to turn into
the inner court of the Lord’s house, to see the Persian rites, this was
east, the situation of Persia. With such exactness is the representation
of the whole vision conducted.” He sees “these three capital
superstitions” portrayed again in <span
id="xiv.viii-p7.3"></span>[Ezekiel
16](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#000)<span id="xiv.viii-p7.3"></span>,
when the Egyptians are described as “great of flesh.” This phrase
Warburton considers to apply to Egypt, because it was “the grand origin
and invention of idolatry.” The “mark upon the forehead,” in <span
id="xiv.viii-p7.4"></span>[Eze
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004)<span id="xiv.viii-p7.4"></span>,
he treats as an expression of God’s special and particular providence.
Jehovah was their Tutelary Deity, and their sin was immeasurably
heightened by the theocratic privileges which they preeminently enjoyed.
Hence this learned writer is enabled to press into his service <span
id="xiv.viii-p7.5"></span>[Eze
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#013)<span id="xiv.viii-p7.5"></span>,
and <span id="xiv.viii-p7.6"></span>[Eze
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008)<span id="xiv.viii-p7.6"></span>,
while he forcibly illustrates both the language and the idea of the
Prophet. His view is confirmed by a passage in Diodorus Sieulus, who, in
lib. 1 p. 59, edit. Wess., records: “Round the room in Thebes where the
body of King Osymanduas seemed to be buried, a multitude of chambers
were built, which had elegant paintings of all the beasts sacred in
Egypt.” Notices of the worship of the Persians will be found in
Perronius’s Itinerary, p. 665, and D’Auquetil’s Voyages, tab. 3. n. 3,
4. Hebenstreit has written a dissertation on the rites of Bacchus to
illustrate this chapter; and Hyde’s Religion of the Ancient Persians,
lib. 1 chap. 27 edit. Oxon., 1760, may be consulted with advantage.

<span id="xiv.ix-p2"></span>THE MAN IN THE LINEN GARMENT.

<span id="xiv.ix-p3"></span><span id="xiv.ix-p3.1"></span>[Ezekiel
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002)<span id="xiv.ix-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ix-p4"></span>Calvin (<span id="xiv.ix-p4.2"></span>[Eze
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002)<span id="xiv.ix-p4.2"></span>)
does not altogether reject the idea that this person prefigured Messiah.
Theodoret’s view seems judicious. “The dress of the seventh person was
that of a priest: for he did not belong to those who punished, but to
those who redeemed those worthy of preservation.” In Jerome’s day it was
thought to represent the Savior, “who is a priest,” says he, and quotes
<span id="xiv.ix-p4.3"></span>[Ps
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004)<span id="xiv.ix-p4.3"></span>,
very appropriately. C. D. Michaelis has remarked the customary method of
carrying the inkhorn in the East in the present day. *Syl. Com. Theol.
Edit. Pott*., volume 2, page 75. The fourth verse explains the reason
why it was carried. Calvin’s allusion to the use of the mark <span
id="xiv.ix-p4.4"></span>תו, *tho*, (<span id="xiv.ix-p4.5"></span>[Ezek.
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#003),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004)<span id="xiv.ix-p4.5"></span>,) is
fully explained by Origen, as quoted by Montfaucon in his notes to the
Hexapla. The invention which Calvin calls “puerile” is recorded by
Jerome, who made good use of Origen, and added other conjectures.
Rosenmuller has quoted in full the passages to which Calvin merely
alludes. Pradus and Vitringa have also amply illustrated the point.

<span id="xiv.ix-p5"></span>On <span id="xiv.ix-p5.1"></span>[Eze
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#009)<span id="xiv.ix-p5.1"></span>,
Calvin translates correctly “fined with bloods.” (<span
id="xiv.ix-p5.2"></span>[Eze 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#009)<span
id="xiv.ix-p5.2"></span>,) Although this is the common reading, it is
not without exception., <span id="xiv.ix-p5.3"></span>חמס, *chemes*,
“violence,” has been found instead of <span
id="xiv.ix-p5.4"></span>דמים, *demim*, “bloods.” A Jewish critic of some
note, R. Sal. Norzi, published a critical commentary in 1742, at Mantua,
and states that the reading “violence” is found in one accurate and
ancient MS., and in one ancient edition. Kimchi attests the same thing;
but neither De Rossi nor Kennicott were able to verify the statement.
This destruction was to begin at the sanctuary, or, as the Septuagint
and Theodoret understand it, with the holy ones, (<span
id="xiv.ix-p5.5"></span>ἀπο τῶν ἁγίων αὐτοῦ,) meaning the priests, who
were the leaders in the desecration of the temple worship. Pradus agrees
with Calvin in the reason given for the slaughter of the priests and
elders first. (<span id="xiv.ix-p5.6"></span>[Eze
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006)<span id="xiv.ix-p5.6"></span>.)
Although the person mentioned in <span id="xiv.ix-p5.7"></span>[Eze
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#011)<span id="xiv.ix-p5.7"></span> is
clothed as before, yet the Septuagint omits the word “linen,” using
simply <span id="xiv.ix-p5.8"></span>ποδὴρη: Theodotion is satisfied
with the Hebrew word *Baddein*, and Aquila has <span
id="xiv.ix-p5.9"></span>*stola*. There is a marginal reading, too,
suggested by the Masoretes; but most of the codexes of Kennicott and Be
Rossi support the received text, as well as the Soncine and
Complutensian editions, and the Babylonian Talmud. Calvin’s translation
and interpretation of this chapter is in accordance with the researches
of modern critics. Maldonatus may be consulted for the opinions of
Jewish writers on important words and phrases.

<span id="xiv.x-p1"></span>Dissertation Tenth.

<span id="xiv.x-p2"></span>THE COALS SCATTERED OVER THE CITY.

<span id="xiv.x-p3"></span><span id="xiv.x-p3.1"></span>[Ezekiel
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#002)<span id="xiv.x-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.x-p4"></span>Jerome, explains this scattering of the coals
over the city as a symbol of its punishment and cleansing by fire, and
quotes <span id="xiv.x-p4.2"></span>[Isa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#017)<span id="xiv.x-p4.2"></span>, in
support of his interpretation; and in accordance with <span
id="xiv.x-p4.3"></span>[Ps 120:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#003)<span
id="xiv.x-p4.3"></span>, he calls them “hot burning coals,” the penalty
of “the false tongue” — <span id="xiv.x-p4.4"></span>remedium lingua,
atque mendacii, and justifies his idea of purifying by <span
id="xiv.x-p4.5"></span>[Isaiah 6](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#000)<span
id="xiv.x-p4.5"></span>. S. Jarcin explains as follows: “<span
id="xiv.x-p4.6"></span>Sanctus ine Benedictus dixit Gabrieli, qui petiit
a cherubino, ut ine sibi daret prunes quo ini paululum refrigescerent
leviusque efticerentur decretum pcena, quoad Judmos sive urbem
Heirosolyroam;” and refers to the commentary of Abarbenel, fol. 170,
col. 4 reed. Maldonatus supposes the coals to indicate not the cleansing
but the destruction of the city; and their collection by the angel at
the command of God, and “from amidst the wheels,” implies that this
burning did not arise by chance and by man’s design, but by God’s
providence and commandment. At <span id="xiv.x-p4.7"></span>[Ezekiel
10](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#000)<span id="xiv.x-p4.7"></span>, we
have already referred to OEcolampadius, but as his comments are most
spiritual, and very inaccessible to the ordinary student of prophecy, we
shall quote a few explanatory passages here. The sprinkling of the coal,
he thinks, to be an image of the burning city,” <span
id="xiv.x-p4.8"></span>quod ex neglecto aut certo male administrando
cultu.” Has real he supposes to represent “those celestial tabernacles
into which the Great high Priest entered once by his own blood, after
procuring eternal redemption.” In the whole vision he sees “Christ the
head of his body, in which the law and spirit of life is included,” and
“how the golden consummation of the elect turns its face towards Christ.
For the are of the Church contains all its parts most elegantly
(elegantissime).” He sees Christ in all parts of the Scriptures, as
their end, scope, and spirit; and especially the man clothed in linen he
says is “Christ acting in this dispensation on the outside of the
eternal tabernacles which he at length entered with his blood.” The
third verse refers to “that judgment which Christ as man shall exercise
by God’s authority.” The voice of the wings signifies “<span
id="xiv.x-p4.9"></span>horrenda vox mah ingruentis,” and the motion of
the wheels “<span id="xiv.x-p4.10"></span>summa in administratione
concordia.” To us these comments seem very fanciful, as it is obvious
that any writer may put forth similar guesses according to his own
private though fallible judgment. The cherubim on the right side Jerome
considers as representing those holy and exalted beings who dwell at
God’s right hand, while evil spirits dwell on his left hand. Michaelis,
however, with less display of fancy, takes a simpler new, not dwelling
on reproaching punishment, but upon the departure of God’s glory from
the temple and city. See Sylog. Corn. Theol., volume 5 page 134;
Eichhorn die Bibl. Proph., part 2, page 456; and Pradus in loc.
especially on <span id="xiv.x-p4.11"></span>[Eze

<span id="xiv.xi-p2"></span>THE FIVE-AND-TWENTY EVIL COUNSELLORS.

<span id="xiv.xi-p3"></span><span id="xiv.xi-p3.1"></span>[Ezekiel
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#001)<span id="xiv.xi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xi-p4"></span>IT is very probable, says Pradus, that as
there were twenty-four rulers, and as many regions into which Jerusalem
was divided, and a chief over them all, so the magistracy of the city is
here brought before us. He recognizes the analogy to the twenty-four
elders in the Apocalypse. But there seems to be no authority for this
division of the city into twenty-four “regions” or wards. See on this
point Jahn Bibl. Arch., part 2 volume 2 section 187. The conduct of
these evil counselors is well portrayed by Theodoret. Some commentators
take this third verse as a question, so do the Arabic and Syriac
versions, “Is it. not near?” but Calvin’s view is the best, and he is
supported by good authorities. Jarcin understands the prophetic
denunciations to be intended, “<span id="xiv.xi-p4.2"></span>ina mala de
quibus prophetic vaticinantur nec in propinqua est poena.” The death of
Pelatiah (in <span id="xiv.xi-p4.3"></span>[Eze
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#013)<span id="xiv.xi-p4.3"></span>,)
as well as the 12th verse, (<span id="xiv.xi-p4.4"></span>[Eze
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#012)<span id="xiv.xi-p4.4"></span>)
are omitted in the Roman and Alexandrian codexes; and in the Arabic
version of the London and Paris Polyglotts. See Wakon’s Proleg. 14:21.
There are some minor variations in the readings of Theodoret, the
Complutensian edition, and the Syriac version. From the concluding
verses of the chapter, the old commentators understand that the prophets
were not bodily transferred to either Jerusalem or Chaldeea. The whole
scene is called an “ecstasy.” The Spirit of God acting on that of the
Prophet, and enduing him with this celestial eye sight.

<span id="xiv.xii"></span>

<span id="xiv.xii-p1"></span>Dissertation Twelfth.

<span id="xiv.xii-p2"></span><span id="xiv.xii-p2.1"></span>α THE FALSE
PROPHETS.

<span id="xiv.xii-p3"></span><span id="xiv.xii-p3.1"></span>[Ezekiel
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#001)<span id="xiv.xii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xii-p4"></span>The very existence of such a chapter as
this suggests some instructive reflections. It may first remind us of
the great moral difference between the position of the Jew and our own.
The existence of prophets implies the corresponding possession of
miraculous witness. A new prophet was a new herald of a fresh truth; and
before he could claim attention he was called upon to show his new
credentials. The false prophets had in reality no such proofs that they
were sent, of God, and yet by speaking smooth things they succeeded in
deluding the people. If surprised at the possibility of such complete
success, we may be reminded of similar instances in the practice of
medicine in our own day among the uneducated. How blindly they rush to
any clever impostor who settles among them with no better credentials
than his ready skin and his audacious pretensions. The more
unenlightened men are the more they catch at any prophet who asserts
roundly and audaciously his mission from God. Now the Jew was called
upon not to inquire first into the doctrine taught, but into “the sign”
worked by the teacher — his first inquiry was to be not what God had
revealed, but whom he has commissioned to teach it. Our position is
rather the reverse. St. Paul assures us, that if an angel from heaven
were to teach any other gospel than that taught by him we are to reject
it. We, then, the readers of the Old Testament prophecies, are not to
find in them a revelation of the Gospel, but, pointing to the coming
Author of the Gospel. “Search the Scriptures,” but for what? “they
testify *of Me*.” Types are fulfilled in the great Antitype — shadows
become substance, and dimness splendor. This chapter of Ezekiel makes
the teacher and his authority the subject of questioning, not the matter
of his instructions. His coming in his own name is his first and all
absorbing sin. However smooth his after communications, this is the
great test of his unholy imposture. The Reformers, in the earnestness of
their zeal, often append such chapters as these directly to themselves
and their enemies. This led them to deal forth the wrath of God with too
indiscriminating a name, and has given rise to the assertion that their
system was a compound of “Moses and the Inquisition.”  <span
id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367) CEcolampadius, for instance,
designates the false teachers of his day, “<span
id="xiv.xii-p5.1"></span>*pinlauti, indocti, stulti, somniatores, caeci,
vuloes dolosae, rapaces, in desertis et it neglectis locis agentes,
timidi, et canes muti*.”  <span id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368)
Whenever there is a strict parallel between true and false teachers in
our own times, such language may be justifiable, but where the right of
private judgment is so largely exercised by ourselves, it is but
consistent to allow others an equally extensive sphere for its
operation. Contending earnestly for the faith and the truth is possible,
without the accumulation of strong epithets on the heads of others.

<span id="xiv.xii-p7"></span><span id="xiv.xii-p7.1"></span>Β ON THE
PRINCIPLE OF ACCOMMODATION.

<span id="xiv.xii-p8"></span><span id="xiv.xii-p8.1"></span>[Ezekiel
13](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#000)<span id="xiv.xii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xii-p9"></span>Our Commentator, in various passages
throughout this Prophet, finds it necessary to introduce the principle
of accommodation. And as this necessity has been so largely insisted on
by succeeding interpreters, we may well attempt to discover the true
method of applying so elastic a principle. For instance, in this
thirteenth chapter, on <span id="xiv.xii-p9.2"></span>[Eze
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#009)<span id="xiv.xii-p9.2"></span>,
he says — “Ezekiel here accommodates his language to the common usage of
mankind,” <span id="xiv.xii-p9.3"></span>*attemperat sermonera*; and
also, “<span id="xiv.xii-p9.4"></span>*pro modulo et ruditate roentis
nostrae*;” on <span id="xiv.xii-p9.5"></span>[Eze
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#016)<span id="xiv.xii-p9.5"></span>,
he asserts that false prophets are so called “<span
id="xiv.xii-p9.6"></span>*improprie*,” not implying any want of
propriety in using the name; but showing that the name only is intended,
and that the reality is not asserted. The formidable list. of German
writers on this important point, collected by Wegscheider in his <span
id="xiv.xii-p9.7"></span>*Institutiones* *Theologicae*, page 99, Hal.
1826, shows it to be worthy of our attentive notice; for when once we
permit ourselves to resolve everything into “<span
id="xiv.xii-p9.8"></span>dictio gnomica et parabolica,” we may refine
away the force and meaning of the prophecies altogether. While we
confine ourselves to the topic immediately before us, a few general
suggestions may be here thrown out. 1. In judging of the correctness of
Calvin’s language, we should remember the peculiar intellectual
tendencies of the Reformers, in consequence of their religious
antagonism to the prevailing doctrines of their day. They saw all around
them the grosset superstitions; they lived among a people who believed
in a real and permanent moral efficacy, proceeding from sacred rites and
ceremonies. They naturally supposed an analogy to exist between the
false teachers of Rome then rampant, and of Israel once beloved. The
majority of the divines of the day were in all their habits of thought
and reasoning — *realists*; that is, they treated abstract religious
ideas as if they were undoubted realities. “Grace,” for instance, must
be something infused, and must be received only through one holy rite,
and communicated fresh and fresh, in union with the elements of another.
The schoolmen, who taught that our nature was actually stained and
polluted by the propagation of original infection, held also that the
laver of regeneration actually washed away this original depravity: if,
in after life, fresh pollution was incurred, then through penance and
the eucharist, fresh grace was transfused by actual and corporal union
with the real body and blood of Christ. The language of Dr. M’Hale in
the present day states the peculiarity of a sacrament to be, that it
impresses an indelible character.  <span
id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369) Chateaubriand speaks of those “who
receive their God” at the altar, “while each incorporates with his own
flesh and blood the flesh and blood of his God.”  <span
id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370)

<span id="xiv.xii-p12"></span>This is Realism run to seed’ and against
all this the Nominalist contended, not by denying the spiritual
realities, but by looking for them in the right places. In the
fourteenth century the University of Paris was famous for its learning,
its resources, and influence over the mind of Europe. The majority in
power and rank were Realists. At length William Occam, an English friar,
assailed their philosophy, and damaged their religious influence.
Himself a disciple of the great Scotus Erigena, he gathered around him a
band of devoted adherents, and became in philosophy what Luther and
Calvin afterwards were in religion. He succeeded sufficiently to attract
the notice of the reigning pope, <span id="xiv.xii-p12.1"></span>John
22<span id="xiv.xii-p12.1"></span>nd. who was sharp-sighted enough to
see that if Nominalism spread Romanism must perish. Hence by his command
in 1339, the University of Paris publicly condemned and denounced the
philosophy of Occam.  <span id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371) As usual,
when the man is denounced, the principles take root and flourish. In
another age, Luther and Melancthon own him as their master and their
guide. The former calls him “<span id="xiv.xii-p13.1"></span>*Carus
maister meus*;” the latter “<span id="xiv.xii-p13.2"></span>*Deliciae
quondam nostrae*.”  <span id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372) The next
century finds the disputes at Paris as fierce as ever. The famous Gerson
and his persevering disciples caused their enemies to respect their
mental sway, till Rome again interfered. In 1743, the Bishop of Avrancis
felt the philosophy of the schools, on which the false doctrines of Rome
were built: in danger, and then he persuaded Louis 11th, the ruling
monarch of France, to order their writings to be seized and their
persons imprisoned. But as time passed on, the king relented, for about
eight years afterwards he revoked his edict, and restored the party to
their former philosophical position. The Reformers lived amidst this
perversion of ideas on religious subjects, and their writings show them
to be unconsciously tinged with the sentiments of the Realists. The
schoolmen, for instance, still argued for a corporeal propagation of
what was termed <span id="xiv.xii-p14.1"></span>*fomes* or <span
id="xiv.xii-p14.2"></span>*concupiscentia*, calling it a <span
id="xiv.xii-p14.3"></span>*qualitas corporis*, derived either from <span
id="xiv.xii-p14.4"></span>*contagione pomi*, or <span
id="xiv.xii-p14.5"></span>*afflatu serpentis*  <span
id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373) While the Lutherans took one step in
the right direction, the Zuinglians added another: and the influence of
the prevailing opinions of their day is very perceptible in the tone in
which the Reformers comment on the prophets. Calvin, for instance, is
remarkable for his sound common-sense view of difficulties: if an
apparent inconsistency occurs, he is ready at once with his phrases,
<span id="xiv.xii-p15.1"></span>*forma loquendi, per concessionem,
ironice*, <span id="xiv.xii-p15.2"></span>καταχρηστικῶς, <span
id="xiv.xii-p15.3"></span>*improprie*, all implying his own riglit to
use his private, judgment in solving a difficulty according to his
pleasure. He often finds it necessary to exercise it. In <span
id="xiv.xii-p15.4"></span>[Eze
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#028)<span id="xiv.xii-p15.4"></span>,
he ventures to suppose a phrase used in a sense directly contrary to its
obvious meaning; and in verses 5-8, (<span
id="xiv.xii-p15.5"></span>[Eze
20:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#005)<span
id="xiv.xii-p15.5"></span>,) he treats the Prophet’s words as “<span
id="xiv.xii-p15.6"></span>*translatiae locutiones*.” His desire to
identify the prophetic teaching with the law of Moses on the one side,
and with the precepts of the gospel on the other, leads him to invent
these varying schemes for avoiding the literal meaning. The
inexperienced student will learn wisdom by allowing the Law, the
Prophets, and the Apostles, to speak their own separate language, and
gradually to develop the designs and the character of God without either
confusion or distortion. Still, the use of the word <span
id="xiv.xii-p15.7"></span>*improprie* must not mislead us; it does not
signify “improperly” in the ordinary sense, but is used as <span
id="xiv.xii-p15.8"></span>*in* and <span
id="xiv.xii-p15.9"></span>*proprie* in Latin. It implies that a phrase
does not bear the meaning which it seems to have it denies the Realist’s
view of a question, and asserts that of the Nominalist. For instance,
righteousness infused is the doctrine of one school; righteousneiss
imputed that of the other the text of the fifty-fifth lecture speaks the
language of the former; the comment of Calvin that of the latter. The
Reformers have taught us to look for spiritual realities where only they
can be found, and to deny their necessary connection with outward
observances and tangible elements, whether under the temple rites, or
the prophetic visions, or the apostolic ordinances.

<span id="xiv.xii-p16"></span><span id="xiv.xii-p16.1"></span>γ ON THE
PHRASE “<span id="xiv.xii-p16.2"></span>PROSTITUERUNT DEUM.”

<span id="xiv.xii-p17"></span><span id="xiv.xii-p17.1"></span>[Ezekiel
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#019)<span id="xiv.xii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xii-p18"></span>The remarks of the last article apply
directly to Calvin’s language respecting the Almighty he says about the
wicked “defile his glory,” “corrupt his justice,” and “prostitute even
God himself,” (<span id="xiv.xii-p18.2"></span>[Eze
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#019)<span
id="xiv.xii-p18.2"></span>,) and then “drown in the lowest abyss of hell
the whole world when disappointed of their gains.” This is the language
of Realists, who suppose it possible for men thus to treat either the
Almighty or their fellow-creatures. The anathemas of the Council of
Trent are founded on the same fallacious bases, and the strong language
of the vulgar savors of the same innate belief. The modern reader at
once supplies the word “name” after the offensive verb “to prostitute.”
Calvin probably understood it so, but, he did not write it so. His
phraseology is largely tinctured with the errors of his times, though he
has written enough to be correctly interpreted by himself. When we
moderns think on the subject for a moment, we admit that no man can
defile God’s glory, or corrupt his justice, or devote his fellow-sinner
to the lowest abyss: we take any such expressions as simply denoting the
views of the speakers or writers about matters immeasurably beyond them.
If we more thoroughly understood the teaching of Locke and the
continental Nominalists respecting abstract ideas, we should live
without any fears of the success of those who unchurch all sects but
their own, and who assert the cleansing efficacy of suffering, and the
possibility of discovering the whole body of Catholic tradition. With
us, for instance, altars are not only prohibited, but impossible. They
are now a mere name — their reality is confined to the one altar, the
Cross. It is equally as impossible to prostitute God as to erect an
altar. The reader of these Commentaries must have observed that Calvin’s
idea of God is rather more familiar than infinite he introduces his name
into the minutest concerns, and thinks of him not as acting by general
and settled laws, but as personally and constantly intervening between
the conduct and the destined of men. He naturally transfers the
conceptions and instincts of morality and holiness which he finds within
himself to the Almighty — he clothes his idea of an awful Spirit with
the attributes of a human conscience he imagines his Deity a divine man,
purified, exalted, and unlimitedly endowed. Our acquaintance with the
physical sciences leads us to see the Great Supreme acting through the
visible universe by fixed and undeviating laws: so we expect that
revelation will unfold to us laws of similar harmony, although
apparently disturbed by the anomaly of rebellion and the mystery of sin.
But Calvin without hesitation supposes \]the to interfere perpetually
with the ordinary processes of our animal nature. For instance, in the
14th verse of this chapter, he supposes the Almighty to withdraw from
the ordinary bread of this life its usual nourishment by way of
punishing the wicked. He is said to break the staff of bread by puffing
it up, and depriving it of its power of affording aliment to the body.
He repeats this singular comment as the correct explanation of the
language of Moses in <span id="xiv.xii-p18.3"></span>[De
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003)<span id="xiv.xii-p18.3"></span>.
(<span id="xiv.xii-p18.4"></span>[Eze
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014)<span
id="xiv.xii-p18.4"></span>.) It may be perfectly true, that “unless God
breathes into the bread the virtue of nourishment the bread is useless;”
but where is the proof that he withdraws this nourishing power when the
bread is tasted by the ungodly? The ignorance of the Reformers of those
physical laws by which it pleases the Almighty that the natural universe
should be governed, was very injurious to them as commentators on sacred
writ’ they were constantly in danger of being like men who write on
glass with diamonds, and thus obscure light with scratches. And not.
only so, when Calvin speaks of “a secret virtue infused into the bread,”
he adopts the language of the Realists: he assumes the existence of a
quality which is philosophically incorrect. A disciple of Locke will be
aware that this supposed virtue is only an abstract idea existing in the
mind of man and not in the bread, and that it is only an admissible form
of speech when it is understood as a general term for the aggregate of
those chemical agents and properties which are realities. If God then
withdraws this “infused virtue,” it is only a form of saying that he
withdraws or suspends certain chemical agencies’ and who will now
confidently assert this to be his method of interfering with the
never-ceasing operations of his creation? So in <span
id="xiv.xii-p18.5"></span>[Eze
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#014)<span id="xiv.xii-p18.5"></span>,
the action of Pinnehas, <span id="xiv.xii-p18.6"></span>[Numbers
25](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#000)<span id="xiv.xii-p18.6"></span>, is
said to be <span id="xiv.xii-p18.7"></span>*infectum aliqto vitio*. This
again is the language of the Realists, and is erroneous. His work could
not be infected morally either way it must have been his mind or his
affections. The language erroneosly transfers moral attributes to the
*deed* instead of to the *man*.

<span id="xiv.xii-p19"></span>And here it may appositely be stated, that
a correct exposition of the Prophecies never requires any violation of
either physical or moral truth. Faith in the unity and supremacy of
truth is one form of faith in God. The prophecies are rather illustrated
than obscured by our increasing knowledge of the material universe. No
true success in prophetic interpretations can be attained without a
hearty reliance on the unity and majesty of all truth, without a calm
confidence that contradictions are only apparent, and if we cannot
explain them now, they will become clear hereafter. Reason, in its
calmest and clearest vision, can be superseded only by being surpassed;
feeling, in its tenderest mood, must still be ennobled by trust; and
conscience must witness audibly and reverently to our need of the
Spitit’s mysterious guidance “into all truth.”

<span id="xiv.xii-p20"></span>Throughout the Prophet Ezekiel, Calvin is
nobly consistent in pleading for God’s justice. There is no instinct
more deeply seated in the human soul than this, — the Godlike must be
just nothing can be permanently opposed to this essential principle. It
must sooner or later be vindicated, and bring a certain measure of
retribution, which must follow hard upon its transgression. Still many
traditional modes of thought concerning the Almighty occur in these
Commentaries, which modern information has very largely modified. God’s
handwriting is now legible in many ways, where of old it was a blank. If
his interposition is not now recognized in cherubs, and wheels, and
burning flame, we are more conscious of the natural wonders developed in
the dewdrop and the flower. Our age believes so many things of which the
Reformers were ignorant, and disbelieves so much on which they laid
stress, that we are in danger of overlooking the existence of great
primeval truths, which constitute the essential religious life in man in
all ages unchangeably. Veneration for what we believe God to be must be
at the foundation of all diety; and imitation of what we believe God to
do must ever be the substance of all duty. ‘The first qualification for
persuing Ezekiel with advantage is the spiritual purification of self;
and in this attainment Calvin materially assists us, by setting before
us large conceptions of the Almighty’s character, and mature judgments
of his purposes.

<span id="xiv.xiii-p5"></span>The allegory which runs through this
chapter is by no means an unusual one in the Prophets. The beginning of
<span id="xiv.xiii-p5.2"></span>[Eze
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003)<span id="xiv.xiii-p5.2"></span>
has occasioned some variety of remark. OEcolampadius takes <span
id="xiv.xiii-p5.3"></span>מכורה, *mekoreh*, meaning “birth,” “origin,”
for <span id="xiv.xiii-p5.4"></span>מגורה, *megoreh*, meaning
“dwelling;” as Calvin translates it <span
id="xiv.xiii-p5.5"></span>habitationes. Houbigant derives it from <span

it may come from <span id="xiv.xiii-p5.7"></span>מכר, *meker*, “to

Rosenmuller reviews these derivations, adding as another, viz. <span
id="xiv.xiii-p5.8"></span>*formationes*; but approves of the sense
“origin,” <span id="xiv.xiii-p5.9"></span>*effossione*, from <span
id="xiv.xiii-p5.10"></span>כור, *cor*, “to dig.” This is clearly the
best, the Jews having constantly before them the digging out of a rock —

<span id="xiv.xiii-p6"></span><span id="xiv.xiii-p6.1"></span>β CAPTIVE
ISRAEL AND PAPAL ROME.

<span id="xiv.xiii-p7"></span><span id="xiv.xiii-p7.1"></span>[Ezekiel
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#020)<span id="xiv.xiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xiii-p8"></span>In commenting on this verse, Calvin draws
a striking comparison between the Jews of Ezekiel’s day and the
Romanists of his own. And as the controversy with Rome is at present a
subject of absorbing interest, it is very important to ascertain the
exact views of the Reformers as to that giant apostacy. The parallel
between them seems to our Reformer most complete. He allows both to be
true Churches, while he condemns them as breakers of God’s covenant.
Both Israel and the Papacy are still said to be under covenant with God;
so, had “our baptism requires no renewal” (<span
id="xiv.xiii-p8.2"></span>[Eze
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#020)<span
id="xiv.xiii-p8.2"></span>,) yet still the devil reigns in the Papacy
without quite extinguishing God’s grace. The Church is there amidst all
its corruptions; otherwise Antichrist could not sit in God’s temple. The
papal priests are said to imitate the Jewish in all things, even to the
material of which the surplice is made. The priests of Rome are called
“<span id="xiv.xiii-p8.3"></span>papales sacrifici“ — the language of
the Realists; which is erroneous, bee,, use it admits too much. It
asserts that they offer sacrifice: the Protestant denies the fact, and
disallows the term. In the controversy with Rome, we should be more
careful than even Calvin in the terms we employ. To allow the analogy
here pointed out, is to allow too much. While we assert, that the
pretense to sacrificial functions is a gross imposture, we must at the
same time refuse their claim to be acknowledged as priests. We must
instantly erect the standard of nominalism, showing that there is but
one high Priest, but one sacrifice, and one altar in the religion of
Christ. This is real — all the rest mere accommodation. On this ground,
too, Calvin’s view of the covenant actually remaining among them, and of
their being such a temple that Antichrist can be seated therein, is very
questionable. It is necessary that the reader should see the
consequences of allowing too much to the advocates of the papacy: there
are many reasons, on which we cannot enter here, for believing that St.
Paul did not refer in any way to Papal Rome by the phrase, “the temple
of God“ and if this be conceded, then Calvin’s argument concerning
Antichrist falls to the ground. It is very important to be aware of the
tinge which the theological language of the sixteenth century gave to
all the writings of that stirring age.

<span id="xiv.xiii-p9"></span><span id="xiv.xiii-p9.1"></span>γ ON THE
WORD “NEPHESH,” SOUL.

<span id="xiv.xiii-p10"></span><span id="xiv.xiii-p10.1"></span>[Ezekiel
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#027)<span id="xiv.xiii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xiii-p11"></span>Calvin expresses himself rather hastily
when he says (<span id="xiv.xiii-p11.2"></span>[Eze
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#027)<span
id="xiv.xiii-p11.2"></span>,) this word <span
id="xiv.xiii-p11.3"></span>נפש, *nepesh*, means “lust,” or desire,
“appetite.” It occurs eighteen times in these twenty chapters of
Ezekiel; and in every case except this, when our version reads “will,”
it is properly translated “soul,” or “person.” As the word is in itself
exceedingly important, and occurs some hundred times throughout the Old
Testament, it is desirable to ascertain how far it admits of so many
various meanings. We thought to lay it down as a general rule, that the
usual sense of a word is not to be departed from without extreme
necessity; and there seems none here for deviating from the ordinary
meaning. Both Castell and Shindler, in their Lexx., give all the various
uses of the word at full length; and both Gesenius and Lee fall into the
error of stating too great a variety of meanings without giving the
reasons for such discordant senses. Its original meaning is “breath;”
and as “life” was supposed to reside in the breath, hence it expresses
anything that has life, any living energy or mental activity, so that
“the soul” is said to hunger and thirst, to fast and become cold. (See
Proverbs, Psalms, and Job.) Schroeder <span
id="xiv.xiii-p11.4"></span>*de Vestitu Mulierum*, and Gesenius, both
give the sense of “fragrance” on <span id="xiv.xiii-p11.5"></span>[Isa
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#020)<span id="xiv.xiii-p11.5"></span>.
The Rabbis distinguish three kinds of *nepish* in man, the vegetative,
the brutal, and the intellectual. This description is philosophically
correct, since it is now ascertained that “the life” of man strictly
partakes of the elements of vegetable and animal vitality, together with
the intellectual power and the moral sentiments, usually termed, ”soul”
in modern divinity. Connecting this word with <span
id="xiv.xiii-p11.6"></span>לב, *leb*, “heart,” we observe that Gesenius
agrees with Calvin on <span id="xiv.xiii-p11.7"></span>[Eze
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#030)<span
id="xiv.xiii-p11.7"></span>, that it signifies “the seat of
intelligence.” The Hebrews supposed that the human heart “was actually
the seat of the affections;” these are now known to ‘act through the
brain, and hence the old phraseology of “giving the heart to God” should
be allowed to become obsolete. There is no proof that the word *nephesh*
implied this immortal principle in man; the hunting souls, and slaying
them, as in the thirteenth chapter, refer to the destruction of life. In
the time of the translators, and in the distant counties of England at
this day, the word “soul” is used where more refined speakers use the
word “person.” For instance, in <span
id="xiv.xiii-p11.8"></span>[Ezekiel
18](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#000)<span id="xiv.xiii-p11.8"></span>,
“the soul that sinneth it shall die,” may be reduced to modern English
by saying, “the person who sins shall die himself.” It is by no means
necessary, in <span id="xiv.xiii-p11.9"></span>[Eze
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#027)<span
id="xiv.xiii-p11.9"></span>, to deviate, with Calvin and our
translators, from the ordinary sense; it is readily rendered, “and
delivered thee up to the persons who hate thee, viz., the daughters,”
etc. Thus two English words only are required as the correct equivalent
for *nephesh* throughout Ezekiel — a point on which we thought to
insist, as giving certainty and definiteness to any version of the
Prophet’s language.

<span id="xiv.xiii-p12"></span><span id="xiv.xiii-p12.1"></span>δ THE
PRIMITIVE CHURCH AND THE NEW TESTAMENT.

<span id="xiv.xiii-p13"></span><span id="xiv.xiii-p13.1"></span>[Ezekiel
16:61](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#061)<span id="xiv.xiii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xiii-p14"></span>It is worthy of notice, that in Calvin’s
time, as in our own, appeals were frequently made to the teaching of
“the primitive Church.” The Reformers were especially anxious to
ascertain what the primitive Church really taught, and to compare it
with Holy Scripture they did not repose implicitly on its dicta, because
they looked upon the phrase as an idea rather than a reality. Here again
the necessary collision between realism and nominalism arises. There is
no such thing as the primitive Church in the sense in which it was used
in Calvin’s day, and has been revived in our own. The words stand for an
abstract idea, comprehending many single churches, and stating what is
held to be common to all. For instance, the Church at Antioch was in
reality the primitive Gentile Church; its doctrines, discipline, and
worship, were realities, and, could they be ascertained accurately,
would present to our minds a destined and definite object; but any
representation of doctrines and ceremonies said to be common to many
Churches, and thus spoken of as appertaining to the primitive Church, is
a mental deduction after the process of selection and assortment has
been carried on. We have to guard against the erroneous view of the
Realist, lest we should look to the primitive Church “to reveal what is
to be believed, rather than to teach what has been revealed.” See an
admirable letter of the Archbishop of Canterbury to Rev. W. Maskell.

<span id="xiv.xiii-p15"></span>Although Calvin’s language throughout
this chapter is precise and correct, yet he inadvertently falls now and
then into that of the earliest. On <span id="xiv.xiii-p15.1"></span>[Eze
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#029)<span id="xiv.xiii-p15.1"></span>
he uses the phrase “<span id="xiv.xiii-p15.2"></span>guttam pietatis in
animis“ — the erroneous language of his Romanist adversaries. Piety, he
knew well enough, was not a thing infused into man — righteousness
infused is the doctrine of realism — righteousness imputed is
nominalism: the former has of late been revived and systematized by
Newman and Ward; while the latter has the inspired sanction of the
Pauline Epistles. In his comments on this verse, our Reformer uses the
word “testament” and “covenant” for the same idea. It is better to avoid
this partial confusion. The word “<span
id="xiv.xiii-p15.3"></span>testamentum“ should properly be applied to
the record, which informs us of the “<span
id="xiv.xiii-p15.4"></span>foedus.” Grotius has expressed the difference
accurately: with him “<span id="xiv.xiii-p15.5"></span>testamentum“ is
equivalent to “<span id="xiv.xiii-p15.6"></span>libri feoderis,” and, as
accuracy in theological expressions is most desirable, it is wiser to
translate <span id="xiv.xiii-p15.7"></span>διαθήκη in every instance by
“covenant,” and to confine the word testament most strictly to the
written record. This will aid us in keeping before our minds the
covenant between the Almighty and his living Church; we shall appreciate
our position as children of the New Covenant, and avoid the error of
regarding the Old Testament, with it’s laws, and ceremonies, and
sacrifices, as binding upon us, who are no longer “children of the bond
woman, but of the free.”

<span id="xiv.xiv-p4"></span>The allegory of “The Great Eagle” is well
sustained throughout this chapter. A golden eagle with extended wings
was the standard of the king of Persia in the time of Cyrus, (Xenoph.
Cyrop., lib. 7 chap. 1,) and it was probably adopted from the Assyrian
empire. The length of its wing is supposed by Grotius to apply to the
widely-extended empire of Nebuchadnezzar. Kimchi interprets “the
variegated color like a peacock” of the majesty and dignity of his
kingdom; but Michaelis agrees with Calvin. The interpretation of
Lebanon, to which Calvin objects, is adopted by Jerome and Theodoret;
but Rosenmuller agrees with our Author. He also takes the word <span
id="xiv.xiv-p4.2"></span>כנען, *ken-men*, (<span
id="xiv.xiv-p4.3"></span>[Eze
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#004)<span id="xiv.xiv-p4.3"></span>,)
exactly in Calvin’s sense, quoting <span id="xiv.xiv-p4.4"></span>[Pr
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#024)<span id="xiv.xiv-p4.4"></span>,
“quod incolae ejus terrae, utpote maris accolae, mercaturae erant
deditissimi.” See also Dathe’s edit. of Glass. Phil. Sac., p. 1184. The
sense which Calvin disapproves is adopted by the Septuagint, the Roman
Codex, the Arabian version, Theodoret, and the Chaldee paraphrast. The
criticism in the note to <span id="xiv.xiv-p4.5"></span>[Eze
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#008)<span id="xiv.xiv-p4.5"></span> is
correct; and the interpretation generally is in accordance with the
explanations of Jarcin, Kimchi, Jerome, Michaelis, Grotius, and other
critics ancient and modern. Newcome has noticed some various readings,
and others are easily gathered from De Rossi, and the different versions
and codexes; but they are not of sufficient interest, to need further
detail.

<span id="xiv.xiv-p7"></span>The interpretation of <span
id="xiv.xiv-p7.2"></span>[Eze
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#022)<span id="xiv.xiv-p7.2"></span>
is worthy of remark. Kimchi and Grotius think that Zerubbabel is
intended here, but Rosenmuller agrees with Calvin in referring it to
Christ. The Chaldee paraphrast and Jarchi apply it to “King Messiah.”
(See Talm. Schabba,, fol. 30, and Cholin, fol. 139, b., and R. Abendana
ad Michal Jopin.) Calvin’s supposition, however, that where the prophets
speak of “this hope of freedom to the elect,” it should be dated from
the rebuilding of the temple, and continued to the end of Christ’s
kingdom, is incorrect. It causes him, to date this kingdom from the
rebuilding of the temple, in forgetfulness of the many disasters which
happened to the people between the times of Ezra and of our Lord. The
building of the second temple was not an event of any immediate
spiritual import to the Jews’ it was followed by overwhelming temporal
disasters; so that the reign of Messiah did not commence till the
Mediator of the New Covenant was revealed, and “the new kingdom of the
heavens” fully heralded into the world at large.

<span id="xiv.xv-p2"></span>Dissertation Fifteenth.

<span id="xiv.xv-p3"></span>THE EATING SOUR GRAPES.

<span id="xiv.xv-p4"></span><span id="xiv.xv-p4.1"></span>[Ezekiel
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#001)<span id="xiv.xv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xv-p5"></span>THE proverb of the fathers eating sour
grapes and the children’s teeth being set on edge, requires a few
remarks, in consequence of the conjectures of some modern writers on
sacred subjects. Andrew Norton, in his elaborate notes on “The
Genuineness of the Gospels,”  <span id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374)
has attempted to show a discrepancy between Ezekiel and the Pentateuch.
He compares this proverb with the language of Exodus, <span
id="xiv.xv-p6.1"></span>[Exodus
20](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#000)<span id="xiv.xv-p6.1"></span>,
where God is said to visit the iniquity of the fathers on the children;
he then quotes the Talmud as objecting to Ezekiel’s prophecies, as
contradictory to the Pentateuch and thus he insinuates that the two
passages cannot be reconciled. If this be so, it is further implied that
the Divine authority of either Exodus or Ezekiel is doubtful. But there
seems no reason to conclude these two passages to be contradictory. The
circumstances under which they were spoken give the tone and meaning to
each. Moses enunciates a general law of God’s moral government, which we
see carried out every day before our eyes. Let the parent of a family,
by honest industry and religious conduct acquire for himself the esteem
and respect of his fellow-men, then it follows by an established law of
God’s providence, that his family gain honorable advantages by their
parent’s reputation. But let a parent by intemperance and dishonesty
bring disgrace and poverty on himself, and it is equally a law of
providential government that his children will suffer by his misconduct.
The wickedness of the father will often fall dreadfully on his
unconscious offspring. This is an undeviating, an irreversible law
applicable at all times, and daily operating before us in ten thousand
instances. But the Jews attempted to excuse their own sins by throwing
them on their fathers. The generation which Ezekiel addressed were
personally blameworthy; the language of this passage was theirs it is
the language of a false excuse — an attempt to charge the Almighty with
unfairness, that they might throw the blame from themselves. No
argument, then, can be drawn from its occurrence contrary to the Divine
authority of the Pentateuch. Ezekiel records the language and chastises
it, thereby upholding the authority of the law, and vindicating rather
than destroying the unity of the Divine records. The destruction to be
received from the chapter has been well pointed out by the present
Archbishop of Canterbury, in his “Apostolic Preaching.” — Sixth edit.,
page 69.

<span id="xiv.xv-p7"></span>A translation of a work: of the Professor of
Biblical Criticism at Heidelberg having been published in London, it
becomes desirable to notice the result of his critical labors on this
chapter of our Prophet. G. L. Bauer, in his “<span
id="xiv.xv-p7.1"></span>Theologie des alten Testaments,” has the
following comment “The whole book of Ezekiel is an illustration of the
Judaic belief, that Jehovah is the King and Governor of his people
Israel. He rewards and punishes them: blesses them with prosperity, and
afflicts them with adversity. Ezekiel teaches (in direct opposition to
the Mosaic doctrine that God will visit the sins of the fathers. upon
the children unto the third and fourth generation), that the son shall
not bear the iniquity of the father that moral conduct will ensure to
the individual length of days that the righteousness of the righteous
shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him,
and that the soul that shineth he shall die. The eighteenth chapter is
the most beautiful and the most useful in the book, but it has reference
exclusively to God’s conduct towards his own people.” Here we have the
usual mixture of Neologian wisdom and folly. There is no real contrast
between Moses and this Prophet. Moses states a general law of God’s
moral government of mankind, and Ezekiel protests against an abuse of
that doctrine. The Jews of his day wished to throw all the blame on
their fathers, and to charge the Almighty with unfairness in punishing’
them for the faults of their ancestors. They forgot their own personal
share in rebellion against the Most high. Nor is it the slightest
objection that “it has reference exclusively to God’s conduct towards
his own people.” Here the Jews are specially addressed, and the
principle is readily applicable to all mankind as soon as it is shown
that they are under similar relations to the Almighty as the Jews. The
writer who cannot see how easily Moses and Ezekiel are reconciled has
but very slight pretensions to occupy a divinity chair; he may make
hasty assertions, and give shrewd guesses; but his opinion thought to be
well weighed before it is reckoned either valuable or trustworthy.
Bauer’s criticisms on various passages of this Prophet are by no means
so objectionable as those on the other Old Testament writers; though he
is open to the charge of exercising that “fertile imagination”  <span
id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375) which he brings so irreverently
against Ezekiel.

<span id="xiv.xv-p9"></span>A question of still larger import arises
naturally out of their own defense of this eighteenth chapter; namely,
what degree of authority have the laws of the Old Covenant over us, the
children of the New? If, on the one hand, the reasonings of Professor
Norton, as contained in the notes to his second volume of his “Evidences
of the Genuineness of the Gospels” are unsound, the following assertion
of a writer, in reply to the Queen’s Professor of Modern History at
Cambridge is unwise — “One inspired declaration is all that is needed,
and whether it be found in the Old Testament or in the New, is all one
to us Christians; it is God’s word, and God’s word cannot deceive.”
 <span id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376) It is clear enough that the Old
Testament is God’s word — but is it so to us? Is its authority the same
“to us Christians” as that of the New? He who would avoid Judaizing must
answer in the negative: he who best understands the nature of our New
Covenant in Christ Jesus will destined carefully between the authority
of the inspired records of the two covenants over the conscience of the
disciples of the new kingdom of the heavens. When we speak of Holy Writ
collectively, as contrasted with all uninspired compositions, it is
emphatically the Word of God; but when we are attempting to define the
relation in which each Testament separately stands to ourselves, we must
not hastily adopt the mere popular language of the day. By doing so, we
are unable to repel the assaults of the worldly wise, and are in danger
of lowering the value of the Sacred Oracles in the eyes of the
scientific inquirers of our times.

<span id="xiv.xv-p11"></span>To the scholar who is acquainted with the
difficulties which are reviewed by Professor Norton, the following
observations will appear elementary; but as there are some simple-minded
believers who may be perplexed by the specious arguments of the skeptic,
a few remarks may be instructive. First of all, we should not treat the
Old Testament as one book all written at the same time. It should be
divided into various portions corresponding to the periods in which each
book was written. The Pentateuch, for instance, should be studied
separately from the Prophets; while the interval of nearly 1000 years,
between the death of Moses and the visions of Ezekiel, should be
constantly borne in mind. The Pentateuch, but not exactly as we have it,
was the Word of God for Jews — its authority as a law to Christians was
never admissible. St. Paul’s whole life was a protest against this going
back again to Moses, instead of going forward to Christ. The
ministration of death was exchanged for a dispensation of life while
God’s moral law remains unchangeable, its authority rests on other
grounds to us than the thunders of Sinai and the tables of stone. Thus,
again, the prophetic announcements were direct and special for Israel
and Judea; but they contain guidance and warning for us only when we are
placed in a similar position morally before God. Ezekiel, for instance,
is a watchman to us only so far as it can be shown that our sins, needs,
and responsibilities are similar to those of the Hebrews. It must be
uttered again and again that we are discipled into the New Covenant of
which St. Paul was a chief herald unto us Gentiles; and our highest
attainment is to stand fast in the liberty wherewith our Redeemer has
made us free. Wherever there is a spiritual analogy between our state
and that of the captives at Chebar, Ezekiel is for us; his stirring
voice is for our reproof and destruction in righteousness; but wherever
the difference of condition is so great that this analogy fails, then
Ezekiel is only indirectly our monitor from heaven. The light from
heaven is reflected directly upon us through Jesus and his Apostles, and
only obliquely through Moses and the Prophets.  <span
id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377)

<span id="xiv.xv-p13"></span>By the expression of this view of the value
of the Old Testament to us, we do but give form and voice to the
feelings which exist in the minds of many earnest and thoughtful
Christians. They cannot receive all that is in the Old Testament as
equally binding on them with what is revealed in the New. Their cannot
sympathize with the antagonist of the Queen’s Professor of History: they
feel that many proposed solutions of acknowledged difficulties are
superficial and evasive rather than self-evident and satisfactory. Such
obstacles are not necessarily connected with the Christian verities,
they are not essential portions of our religion: we may safely confess
ourselves ignorant of the true solution, without endangering a single
particle of “the faith once delivered to the saints.” By upholding the
Pentateuch as the Word of God to the Jews of former ages, we defend and
enforce its inspiration and suitability for its original time and
purpose; by treating the prophecies of the era of the Captivity as
spoken originally to the people *alive at the time*, we vindicate the
Divine inspiration of the Prophet, and we prepare our own minds to
receive intelligently any indirect destruction which may be applicable
to ourselves. The integrity of the Jewish canon is thus acknowledged and
preserved, while we are free to inquire how far its sacred books are
instructive for all times and all nations. The whole life and ministry
of St. Paul taught one invariable truth on this important question, and
its significant witness was clear and emphatic to our higher privileges
and nobler aims under the New Covenant in Christ Jesus our Lord.

<span id="xiv.xv-p14"></span><span id="xiv.xv-p14.2"></span>β USURY AND
INTEREST.

<span id="xiv.xv-p15"></span><span id="xiv.xv-p15.1"></span>[Ezekiel
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#008)<span id="xiv.xv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xv-p16"></span>The manner in which this subject is treated
illustrates our remarks on the non-application of the Jewish law to
Christian duties. Calvin is evidently at a loss how to distinguish
between lawful and unlawful interest. He does not clearly say that one
law was applicable to the Jew and another to us. Usury may be sinful,
but not because it was forbidden to Israel of old. The comment on this
verse is not based upon principles in accordance with the New Covenant.
It may fairly be stated that this eighteenth chapter is not law to us;
our duties depend upon another foundation. The law which is to decide
what is “interest” and what “usury,” must rest upon the golden rule of
doing unto others as we would that they should do unto us. If we be
formed after the image of Christ, we shall educate conscience, and
cultivate justice and mercy, and decide these points by a different
standard from that of the Jewish law; and when Calvin states “<span
id="xiv.xv-p16.2"></span>in lege ea est perfectio ad quam nihil possit
accedere,” he does not state the sense in which he uses ‘<span
id="xiv.xv-p16.3"></span>qege,” and seems to confine it to the Mosaic
precepts. This instance is sufficient to show the true use which we are
to make of the Old Testament, and to guard us against a misapplication
of its statements.

<span id="xiv.xv-p17"></span>A singular instance of the fallacy of
applying the Old Testament directly to the events of the world in the
present day occurs in the State Trials in the reign of James the Second.
In the case of the East India Company *5* Sandys, a question arose
respecting the right of the King’s subjects to trade with nations
eastward of the Cape of Good Hope without the King’s license. Holt,
afterwards the celebrated Chief-Justice, argued his point with more,
zeal than discretion. He gravely cites the doctrine of Lord Coke, that
“infidels are perpetual enemies;” and then, in the same breath, quotes
the book of Judges, to show by analogy, that as the Jews were restrained
from merchandise with the Canaanites, so Christians thought to be
restricted in their dealings with Pagans.  <span
id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378) One instance out of many may suffice
to remind us, that the assumption that Christians are in all cases to
act according to God’s commands to the Jews, is the bashes of modern
Judaism; and the frequency of such reasonings, though supported at times
by the writings of some of our venerable Reformers, calls loudly for the
voice of another Paul to proclaim, “Stand fast in the liberty wherewith
Christ has made you free.”

<span id="xiv.xv-p19"></span>The imprudent manner in which some
commentators have connected the incidents of the Old Testament with the
doctrine of the New is readily illustrated by a passage in the first
epistle to the Corinthians by Clement of Rome. In quoting the narrative
of Rahab receiving the spies before the destruction of Jericho, he
adverts to their suggesting the hanging out a scarlet thread from her
house, and then adds directly, “making: it manifest that by the blood of
the Lord redemption shall be to all those who believe and trust upon
God. You see then, beloved, that there was not only faith, but prophecy
in the woman.”  <span id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379) if this method
of illustration be considered allegorical, and as only suggestive of a
remote comparison, it is tolerable; but if it be intended to imply any
typical connection between the accident of the scarlet color and the
redemption through Messiah, it is irreverent and inappropriate in the
extreme. The learned Wotton defends Clement by the example of his
master, Paul, and quotes Justin Martyr, who treats the same event “as a
symbol of the blood of Christ.”  <span id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380)
Guided by such illustrious names, the Reformers often adopted the same
“spiritualizing” system. The sounder and soberer criticism of later days
has instructed us not to adopt the imaginations of men as if they were
inseparably bound up with the supreme word of God. The following extract
is worthy of notice, as illustrating the principles for which we
contend: —

<span id="xiv.xv-p22"></span>“The same freedom of thought \[as that of
Luther\] on topics not strictly theological formed a prominent feature
in the character of Calvin. A curious instance of it occurs in one of
his letters,  <span id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381) where he discussed
an ethical question of no small moment in the science of political
economy, ‘How far it is consistent with morality to accept of interest
for a pecuniary loan?’ On this question, which, even in Protestant
countries, continued till a very recent period to divide the opinions
both of divines and Lawyers, Calvin treats the authority of Aristotle
and that of the Church with equal disregard. To the former he opposes a
close and logical argument not unworthy of Mr. Bentham: to the latter he
replies, by showing that the Mosaic law on this point, was not a moral,
but a municipal prohibition — a prohibition not to be judged of from any
particular text of Scripture, but upon the principles of natural
equity.”  <span id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382)

<span id="xiv.xv-p26"></span><span id="xiv.xv-p26.1"></span>γ PERPLEXING
AND THORNY QUESTIONS.

<span id="xiv.xv-p27"></span><span id="xiv.xv-p27.1"></span>[Ezekiel
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#020)<span id="xiv.xv-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xv-p28"></span>In this and the following verses Calvin
pronounces rather too dogmatically upon matters which are beyond human
comprehension. He strives to reconcile statements apparently
contradictory, and in doing so enunciates principles which cannot be
positively determined. For instance, the will of an infant, before its
birth, is said to be “perverse and rebellious against God,” <span
id="xiv.xv-p28.2"></span>[Eze
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#020)<span id="xiv.xv-p28.2"></span>.
Although we are reminded (<span id="xiv.xv-p28.3"></span>[Eze
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#023)<span id="xiv.xv-p28.3"></span>)
that God’s secret counsels are inscrutable to us, yet the assertion is
hazarded that he “has devoted the reprobate to eternal destruction, and
wishes them to perish.” Some effort is made to reconcile the freeness of
this will with the certainty of the destruction the knot is said to be
“easily untied;” but the experience of nearly three centuries has proved
that these exciting disputes have not been satisfactorily settled: they
are still what they are called in <span id="xiv.xv-p28.4"></span>[Eze
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#025)<span id="xiv.xv-p28.4"></span>,
“perplexing and thorny questions,” and must remain so till the promise
is accomplished, that faith shall be exchanged for sight. It does not
seem desirable to enter upon these abstruse points when commenting upon
a Hebrew Prophet: the revelation to Ezekiel was far different in its
subject-matter from that to St. Paul: there is no necessity for
supposing either that the evangelical doctrines were fully made known to
the Prophets, or that their language is verbally binding upon us — the
offspring of the far-off Gentiles.

<span id="xiv.xv-p29"></span>In these “Dissertations” we only venture to
suggest some general principles of correct interpretation, and to point
out some errors into which our Reformer has fallen, partly through the
infirmity natural to man, and partly through the philosophical systems
and the false divinity current in his times. While he so evidently
surpassed his own age in stern and devoted piety, and avoided the
fanciful conjectures in which many of the Reformers indulged; Calvin is
at times open to the charge of teaching dogmatically questions which
have never been decided by Revelation. Let us bear with him on this
point, while we profit by his judicious and instructive lectures;
remembering that within the fringes of his shadow his modern revilers
are not worthy to tread.

<span id="xiv.xv-p30"></span>Another instance of perplexity occurs in
<span id="xiv.xv-p30.1"></span>[Eze
20:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#039)<span id="xiv.xv-p30.1"></span>.
The “Indecision” refers to the decree of the Emperor Charles V. called
“The Interim.” Calvin’s hatred of it was sincere but injudicious. It was
a first step to better things. See Mosheim, cent. 16 sect. 1, and the
authorities quoted in Maclaine’s note.

<span id="xiv.xvi-p3"></span>THE SABBATH A SACRAMENT AND A MYSTERY.

<span id="xiv.xvi-p4"></span><span id="xiv.xvi-p4.1"></span>[Ezek.
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#013),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#014)<span id="xiv.xvi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xvi-p5"></span>We have already cautioned the modern reader
of Calvin not to be startled at his assertion, that “the Sabbath is
Sacrament.” We have in these days become so thoroughly imbued with the
notion that; there can be but two Sacraments, that we reject at once the
possibility of, third. This causes us again to call the reader’s
attention in detail to the principles expressed in the note to the 20th
verse of this chapter.

<span id="xiv.xvi-p6"></span>A number of words occur in theological
discussions which are not met with in Holy Scripture. Among these are
the words <span id="xiv.xvi-p6.1"></span>*Sacramentum, Persona,
Trinitas, Unitas*. If these were merely translations of equivalent Greek
words found in the New Testament, all difficulty would cease; but they
are not although they express the ideas of the Apostles correctly, if
taken in the sense in which they were originally used. The Protestant of
these later times, if he would understand them aright, should study
their use in the Schoolmen, and by the leading writers of the Church of
Rome, and then, approach the writings of the Reformers. Lawrence’s
Bampton Lectures have already been mentioned: besides these, Bishop
Davenant’s <span id="xiv.xvi-p6.2"></span>*Determinationes* of
theological questions, when Margaret Professor of Divinity at Cambridge,
are a valuable specimen of the subject-matter of theological dispute in
the days immediately preceding his own. (See edit. 1634, and also 1639,
in Lib. of Queen’s Coll., Cam.) The greatest mistakes have been
committed by English writers on Theology in consequence of their
unconscious subjection to a traditional phraseology. It may fairly be
called a slavery to words. They have lost sight of realities, through
anxiety for a verbal orthodoxy. This has led them to look for spiritual
realities where riley are not to be found. In tracing the cause of this,
we find it to arise from our receiving so many of our theological
expressions through the Latin Vulgate. And not only are the words, but
the ideas, of the Reformers tinctured by their education under the
religious philosophy which they rejected. Calvin, for instance, in <span
id="xiv.xvi-p6.3"></span>[Eze
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#016)<span id="xiv.xvi-p6.3"></span>,
uses the phrase “<span id="xiv.xvi-p6.4"></span>*guttam pietarts*;” in
<span id="xiv.xvi-p6.5"></span>[Eze
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#020)<span id="xiv.xvi-p6.5"></span>,
“<span id="xiv.xvi-p6.6"></span>*guttam fidei*;” and in <span
id="xiv.xvi-p6.7"></span>[Eze
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#019)<span id="xiv.xvi-p6.7"></span>,
“<span id="xiv.xvi-p6.8"></span>*suis commentis inficiunt legem
ipsius*,” the two former expressions implying that piety and faith are
qualities within the soul, measurable by quantity’ and the latter, that
the fictions of man can in any way affect the purity of the law of God.
Instances of this kind are here pointed out, that we may be aware of the
principle on which Calvin’s expressions on many interesting points
frequently rest. Other words as well as <span
id="xiv.xvi-p6.9"></span>*sacramentum* are used by Calvin in a sense
rather different from their modern meaning. For example, <span
id="xiv.xvi-p6.10"></span>virtus and <span
id="xiv.xvi-p6.11"></span>virtutes, <span
id="xiv.xvi-p6.12"></span>doctrina and <span
id="xiv.xvi-p6.13"></span>religio, occur throughout these Lectures, and
sometimes need a circumlocution for their English equivalents. In <span
id="xiv.xvi-p6.14"></span>[Eze
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#029)<span id="xiv.xvi-p6.14"></span>
<span id="xiv.xvi-p6.15"></span>*religio* occurs for respect paid to
idols, and “<span id="xiv.xvi-p6.16"></span>*mysterium*“ must be taken
rather in its classical than its familiar meaning. The Greek <span
id="xiv.xvi-p6.17"></span>μυστηριόν was translated “<span
id="xiv.xvi-p6.18"></span>*sacramentum*“ in the copies used by
Tertullian, Cyprian, and Ambrose. Tertullian accordingly calls the
doctrines of the Trinity and of our Lord’s Incarnation “<span
id="xiv.xvi-p6.19"></span>s*acramenta*.” Prudentius uses it for “the
whole Christian doctrine,” as St. Paul does the word <span
id="xiv.xvi-p6.20"></span>μυστηρίον <span id="xiv.xvi-p6.21"></span>[1Co
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001)<span id="xiv.xvi-p6.21"></span>.
It is sufficient to point out this difference in the use of terms, that
no reader may judge Calvin hastily, but rather be led to discover the
error or the unsoundness in himself. Those Reformers who were more
strenuous Nominalists than Calvin, did not deny the realities of the
faith but they thought for them *where they are only to be found:* not
in rites, and words, and creeds, and ceremonies, but in the inner soul
of man; in our moral and spiritual nature; in the character and
revelation of God; in the teachings and guidings of the Holy Spirit; and
in the renewed lives and peaceful deaths of all who are new-created in
Christ Jesus their Lord.
