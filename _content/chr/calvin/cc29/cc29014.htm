<p><a name="v.ii.i-p2"></A><b>1.</b> In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="v.ii.i-p3"></A><b>1.</b> Anno secundo Darii regis, mense sexto, die primo mensis, datus fuit sermo Jehovae in manum Chaggai Prophetae ad Zerubbabel, filium Sealtiel, ducem Jehudah, et ad Jehosuah, filium Jehosadak, sacerdotem magnum, dicendo&#8212;</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN39"><a name="v.ii.i-p4"></A><a name="v.ii.i-p4.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.i-p5"></A>The Prophet mentions here the year, the month, and the day in which he began to rouse up the people from their sloth and idleness, by the command of God; for every one studied his own domestic interest, and had no concern for building the Temple.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.i-p6"></A>This happened, he says, <i>in the second year of Darius the king</i>. Interpreters differ as to this time; for they do not agree as to the day or year in which the Babylonian captivity began. Some date the beginning of the seventy years at the ruin which happened under Jeconiah, before the erasing of the city, and the destruction of the Temple. It is, however, probable, that a 				considerable time had passed before Haggai began his office as a Prophet; for Babylon was taken twenty years, or little more, before the death of king Cyrus; his son Cambyses, who reigned eight years, succeeded him. The third king was Darius, the son of Hystaspes, whom the Jews will have to be the son of Ahasuerus by Esther; but no credit is due to their fancies; for they hazard any bold notion in matters unknown, and assert anything that may come to their brains or to their mouths; and thus 				they deal in fables, and for the most part without any semblance of truth. It may be sufficient for us to understand, that this Darius was the son of Hystaspes, who succeeded Cambyses, (for I omit the seven months of the Magi; for as they crept in by deceit, so shortly after they were destroyed;) and it is probable that Cambyses, who was the first-born son of Cyrus, had no male heir. Hence it was that his brother being slain by the consent of the nobles, the kingdom came to Darius. He, then, as 				we may learn from histories, was the third king of the Persians. Daniel says, in the fifth chapter <a name="v.ii.i-p6.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#001">Da 5:1</a><a name="v.ii.i-p6.1"></A>, that the city of Babylon had been taken by Cyrus, but that Darius the Mede reigned there.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.i-p7"></A>But between writers there is some disagreement on this point; though all say that Cyrus was king, yet Xenophon says, that Cyaxares was ever the first, so that Cyrus sustained only the character, as it were, of a regent. But Xenophon, as all who have any judgement, and are versed in history, well know, did not write a history, but fabled most boldly according to his own fancy; for he invents the tale that Cyrus was brought up by his maternal 				grandfather, Astyages. But it is evident enough that Astyages had been conquered in war by Cyrus.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">127</FONT></A>
 				He says also that Cyrus married a wife a considerable time after the taking of Babylon, and that she was presented to him by his uncle Cyaxares, but that he dared not to marry her until he returned to Persia, and his father Cambyses approved of the marriage. Here Xenophon fables, and gives range to his own invention, for it was not his purpose to write a history. He is a very fine writer, it is true; but the unlearned are much mistaken who think that he has collected all the 				histories of the world. Xenophon is a highly approved philosopher, but not an approved historian; for it was his designed object fictitiously to relate as real facts what seemed to him most suitable. He fables that Cyrus died in his bed, and dictated a long will, and spoke as a philosopher in his retirement; but Cyrus, we know, died in the Scythian war, and was slain by the queen, Tomyris, who revenged the death of her son; and this is well known even by children. Xenophon, however, as he 				wished to paint the image of a perfect prince, says that Cyrus died in his bed. We cannot then collect from the <i>Cyropaeda</i>, which Xenophon has written, anything that is true. But if we compare the historians together, we shall find the following things asserted almost unanimously: &#8212; That Cambyses was the son of Cyrus; that when he suspected his younger brother he gave orders to put him to death; that both died without any male issue; and that on discovering the fraud of the Magi,  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">128</FONT></A>
 				the son of Hystaspes became the third king of the Persian. Daniel calls Darius, who reigned in Babylon, the Mede; but he is Cyaxares. This I readily admit; for he reigned by sufferance, as Cyrus willingly declined the honor. And Cyrus, though a grandson of Astyages, by his daughter Mandane, was yet born of a father not ennobled; for Astyages, having dreamt that all Asia would be covered by what proceeded from his daughter, was easily induced to marry her to a stranger. When, 				therefore, he gave her to Cambyses, his design was to drive her to a far country, so that no one born of her should come to so great an empire: this was the advice of the Magi. Cyrus then acquired a name and reputation, no doubt, only by his own efforts; nor did he venture at first to take the name of a king, but suffered his uncle, and at the same time his father-in-law, to reign with him; and yet he was his colleague only for two years; for Cyasares lived no longer than the taking of 				Babylon.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.i-p10"></A>I come then now to our Prophet: he says, <i>In the second year of Darius </i>it was commanded to me by the Lord to reprove the sloth of the people. We may readily conclude that more than twenty years had elapsed since the people began to return to their own country.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">129</FONT></A>
 				 Some say thirty or forty years, and others go beyond that number; but this is not probable. Some say that the Jews returned to their country in the fifty-eighth year of their captivity; but this is not true, and may be easily disproved by the words of Daniel as well as by the history of Ezra. Daniel says in the ninth chapter <a name="v.ii.i-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001">Da 9:1</a><a name="v.ii.i-p11.1"></A> that he was reminded by 				God of the return of the people when the time prescribed by Jeremiah was drawing nigh. And as this happened not in the first year of Darius, the son of Hystaspes, but about the end of the reign of Belshasar before Babylon was taken, it follows that the time of the exile was then fulfilled. We have also this at the beginning of the history, &#8216;When seventy years were accomplished, God roused the spirit of Cyrus the king.&#8217; We hence see that Cyrus had not allowed the free return of the people but at 				the time predicted by Jeremiah, and according to what Isaiah had previously taught, that Cyrus, before he was born, had been chosen for this work: and then God began openly to show how truly he had spoken before the people were driven into exile. But if we grant that the people returned in the fifty-eighth year, the truth of prophecy will not appear. They therefore speak very thoughtlessly who say that the Jews returned to their country before the seventieth year; for thus they subvert, as I 				hare said, every notion of God&#8217;s favor.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.i-p12"></A>Since then seventy years had elapsed when Babylon was taken, and Cyrus by a public edict permitted the Jews to return to their country, God at that time stretched forth his hand in behalf of the miserable exiles; but troubles did afterwards arise to them from their neighbors. Some under the guise of friendship wished to join them, in order to obliterate the name of Israel; and that they might make a sort of amalgamation of many nations. 				Then others openly carried on war with them; and when Cyrus was with his army in Scythia, his prefects became hostile to the Jews, and thus a delay was effected. Then followed Cambyses, a most cruel enemy to the Church of God. Hence the building of the Temple could not be proceeded with until the time of this Darius, the son of Hystaspes. But as Darius, the son of Hystaspes, favored the Jews, or at least was pacified towards them, he restrained the neighboring nations from causing any more 				delay as to the building of the Temple. He ordered his prefects to protect the people of Israel, so that they might live quietly in their country and finish the Temple, which had only been begun. And we may hence conclude that the Temple was built in forty-six years, according to what is said in the second chapter of John  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">130</FONT></A>
 				(<a name="v.ii.i-p13.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001">Joh 2:1</a><a name="v.ii.i-p13.3"></A>); for the foundations were laid immediately on the return of the people, but the work was either neglected or hindered by enemies.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.i-p14"></A>But as liberty to build the Temple was given to the Jews, we may gather from what our Prophet says, that they were guilty of ingratitude towards God; for private benefit was by every one almost exclusively regarded, and there was hardly any concern for the worship of God. Hence the Prophet now reproves this indifference, allied as it was with ungodliness: for what could be more base than to enjoy the country and the 				inheritance which God had formerly promised to Abraham, and yet to make no account of God, nor of that special favor which he wished to confer &#8212; that of dwelling among them? An habitation on mount Sion had been chosen, we know, by God, that thence might come forth the Redeemer of the world. As then this business was neglected, and each one built his own house, justly does the Prophet here reprove them with vehemence in the name and by the command of God. Thus much as to the time. And he says in 				the <i>second</i> year of Darius, for a year had now elapsed since liberty to build the Temple had been allowed them; but the Jews were negligent, because they were too much devoted to their own private advantages.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.i-p15"></A>And he says, that <i>the word was given by his hand to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and to Joshua, the son of Josedech</i>. We shall hereafter see that this communication had a regard without distinction to the whole community; and, if a probable conjecture be entertained, neither Zerubbabel nor Joshua were at fault, because the Temple ass neglected; nay, we may with 				certainty conclude from what Zechariah says, that Zerubbabel was a wise prince, and that Joshua faithfully discharged his office as a priest. Since then both spent their labor for God, how was it that the Prophet addressed them? and since the whole blame belonged to the people, why did he not speak to them? why did he not assemble the whole multitude? The Lord, no doubt, intended to connect Zerubbabel and Joshua with his servant as associates, that they three might go forth to the people, and 				deliver with one mouth what God had committed to his servant Haggai. This then is the reason why the Prophet says, that he was sent to Zerubbabel and Joshua.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.i-p16"></A>Let us at the same time learn, that princes and those to whom God has committed the care of governing his Church, never so faithfully perform their office, nor discharge their duties so courageously and strenuously, but that they stand in need of being roused, and, as it were, stimulated by many goads. I have already said, that in other places Zerubbabel and Joshua are commended; yet the Lord reproved them and severely expostulated with 				them, because they neglected the building of the Temple. This was done, that they might confirm by their authority what the Prophet was about to say: but he also intimates, that they were not wholly free from blame, while the people were thus negligent in pursuing the work of building the Temple.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.i-p17"></A>Zerubbabel is called the son of Shealtiel: some think that son is put here for grandson, and that his father&#8217;s name was passed over. But this seems not probable. They quote from the Chronicles a passage in which his father&#8217;s name is said to be Pedaiah: but we know that it was often the case among that people, that a person had two names. I therefore regard Zerubbabel to have been the son of Shealtiel. He is said to have been the governor  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">131</FONT></A>
 				of Judah; for it was necessary that some governing power should continue in that tribe, though the royal authority was taken away, and all sovereignty and supreme power extinguished. It was yet God&#8217;s purpose that some vestiges of power should remain, according to what had been predicted by the patriarch Jacob,</p>  			 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.ii.i-p19"></A>&#8216;Taken away shall not be the scepter from Judah, nor a leader from his thigh, until he shall come;&#8217; etc. (<a name="v.ii.i-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010">Ge 49:10</a><a name="v.ii.i-p19.1"></A>.)</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.i-p20"></A>The royal scepter was indeed taken away, and the crown was removed, according to what Ezekiel had said, &#8216;Take away the crown, subvert, subvert, subvert it,&#8217; (<a name="v.ii.i-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026">Ezek. 21:26</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027">27</a><a name="v.ii.i-p20.1"></A>;) for the interruption of the government had been sufficiently long. Yet the Lord in the meantime preserved some remnants, that the Jews might know that that 				promise was not wholly forgotten. This then is the reason why the son of Shealtiel is said to be the governor of Judah. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="v.ii.ii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="v.ii.ii-p1"></A><a name="v.ii.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#002">Haggai 1:2-4</a><a name="v.ii.ii-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="v.ii.ii-p2"></A><b>2.</b> Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the Lord&#8217;s house should be built.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="v.ii.ii-p3"></A><b>2.</b> Sic dicit Iehova exercituum, dicendo, Populus isti dicunt (hoc est, dicit,) Non venit tempus domui Iehovae ad aedificandum.</p>

<p><a name="v.ii.ii-p7"></A><b>4.</b> An tempus vobis, ut habitatis vos in domibus vestris tabulatis, et domus haec deserta?</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN39"><a name="v.ii.ii-p8"></A><a name="v.ii.ii-p8.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.ii-p9"></A>They who think that seventy years had not passed until the reign of Darius, may from this passage be easily disproved: for if the seventy years were not accomplished, an excuse would have been ready at hand, &#8212; that they had deferred the work of building the Temple; but it was certain, that the time had then elapsed, and that it was owing to their indifference that the Temple was not erected, for all the materials were appropriated to 				private uses. While then they were thus taking care of themselves and consulting their own interest, the building of the Temple was neglected. That the Temple was not built till the reign of Darius, this happened, as we have said, from another cause, because the prefects of king Cyrus gave much annoyance to the Jews, and Cambyses was most hostile to them. But when liberty was restored to them, and Darius had so kindly permitted them to build the Temple, they had no excuse for delay.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.ii-p10"></A>It is however probable that they had then many disputes as to the time; for it may have been, that they seizing on any pretext to cover their sloth, made this objection, &#8212; that many difficulties had occurred, because they had been too precipitate, and that they had thus been punished for their haste, because they had rashly undertaken the building of the Temple: and we may also suppose that they took another view of the time as having not 				yet come, for easily might this objection occur to them, &#8212; &#8220;It is indeed true that the worship of God is deservedly to be preferred to all other things; but the Lord grants us this indulgence, so that we are allowed to build our own houses; and in the meantime we attend to the sacrifices. Have not our fathers lived many ages without a Temple? God was then satisfied with a sanctuary: there is now an altar erected, and there sacrifices are offered. The Lord then will forgive us if we defer the 				building of the Temple to a suitable time. But in the meantime every one may build his own house, so that afterwards the Temple may at leisure be built more sumptuously.&#8221; However this may have been, we find that true which I have often stated, &#8212; that the Jews were so taken up with their own domestic concerns, with their own ease, and with their own pleasures, that they made very little account of God&#8217;s worship. This is the reason why the Prophet was so greatly displeased with them.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.ii-p11"></A>He declares what they said, <i>This people say, The time is not yet come to build the house of Jehovah</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">132</FONT></A>
 				 He repeats here what the Jews were wont to allege in order to disguise their sloth, after having delayed a long time, and when they could not, except through consummate effrontery, adduce anything in their own defense. We however see, that they hesitated not to promise pardon to themselves. Thus also do men indulge themselves in their sins, as though they could make an agreement with God and pacify him with some frivolous things. We see that this was the case 				then. But we may also see here, as in a mirror, how great is the ingratitude of men. The kindness of God had been especially worthy of being remembered, the glory of which ought to have been borne in mind to the end of time: they had been restored from exile in a manner beyond what they had ever expected. What ought they to have done, but to have devoted themselves entirely to the service of their deliverer? But they built, no, not even a tent for God, and sacrificed in the open air; and thus 				they wilfully trifled with God. But at the same time they dwelt at ease in houses elegantly fitted up.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.ii-p15"></A>And how is the case at this day? We see that through a remarkable miracle of God the gospel has shone forth in our time, and we have emerged, as it were, from the abodes below. Who does now rear up, of his own free-will, an altar to God? On the contrary, all regard what is advantageous only to themselves; and while they are occupied with their own concerns, the worship of God is cast aside; there is no care, no zeal, no concern for it; 				nay, what is worse, many make gain of the gospel, as though it were a lucrative business. No wonder then, if the people have so basely disregarded their deliverance, and have almost obliterated the memory of it. No less shameful is the example witnessed at this day among us.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.ii-p16"></A>But we may hence also see how kindly God has provided for his Church; for his purpose was that this reproof should continue extant, that he might at this day stimulate us, and excite our fear as well as our shame. For we also thus grow frigid in promoting the worship of God, whenever we are led to seek only our own advantages. We may also add, that as God&#8217;s temple is spiritual, our fault is the more atrocious when we become thus slothful; 				since God does not bid us to collect either wood, or stones, or cement, but to build a celestial temple, in which he may be truly worshipped. When therefore we become thus indifferent, as that people were thus severely reproved, doubtless our sloth is much more detestable. We now see that the Prophet not only spoke to men of his age, but was also destined, through God&#8217;s wonderful purpose, to be a preacher to us, so that his doctrine sounds at this day in our ears, and reproves our torpor and 				ungrateful indifference: for the building of the spiritual temple is deferred, whenever we become devoted to ourselves, and regard only what is advantageous to us individually. We shall go on with what follows tomorrow.</p>  <a name="v.ii.iii"></A>  			 
<p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld27"><a name="v.ii.iii-p1"></A>Prayer</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.iii-p2"></A>Grant, Almighty God, that as we must carry on a warfare in this world, and as it is thy will to try us with many contests, &#8212; O grant, that we may never faint, however extreme may be the trials which we shall have to endure: and as thou hast favored us with so great an honor as to make us the framers and builders of thy spiritual temple, may every one of us present and consecrate himself wholly to thee: and, inasmuch as each of us has received some 				peculiar gift, may we strive to employ it in building this temple, so that thou mayest be worshipped among us perpetually; and especially, may each of us offer himself wholly as a spiritual sacrifice to thee, until we shall at length be renewed in thine image, and be received into a full participation of that glory, which has been attained for us by the blood of thy only-begotten Son. Amen.</p>  <a name="v.ii.iv"></A>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref26"><a name="v.ii.iv-p1"></A>Lecture One Hundred and Twenty-ninth</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.iv-p2"></A>When the Prophet asks, whether the time had come for the Jews to dwell in splendid and well furnished houses, and whether the time had not come to build the Temple, he intimates, that they were trifling in a very gross manner with God; for there was exactly the same reason for building the Temple as for building the city. How came they to be restored to their country, but that God performed what he had testified by the mouth of Jeremiah? 				Hence their return depended on the redemption promised to them: it was therefore easy for them to conclude, that the time for building the Temple had already come; for the one could not, and ought not to have been separated from the other, as it has been stated. He therefore upbraids them with ingratitude, for they sought to enjoy the kindness of God, and at the same time disregarded the memorial of it.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.iv-p3"></A>And very emphatical are the words, when he says, <i>Is it time for you to dwell in houses?</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">133</FONT></A>
 				 For there is implied a comparison between God, whose Temple they set no value on, and themselves, who sought not only commodious, but sumptuous dwellings. Hence the Prophet inquires, whether it was consistent that mortal men, who differ not from worms, should possess magnificent houses, and that God should be without his Temple. And to the same purpose is what he adds, when he says, that their <i>houses</i> were 				<i>boarded</i>; for <a name="v.ii.iv-p4.3"></A>&#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <i>saphunim</i>, means in Hebrew what we express by <i>Cambrisees</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">134</FONT></A>
 				 Since then they were not satisfied with what was commodious, without splendor and luxury being added, it was extremely shameful for them to rob God at the same time of his Temple, where he was to be worshipped. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="v.ii.v"></A>

How comes it that ye are famished, that both heaven and earth deny food to you? Besides, though ye consume much food, it yet does not satisfy you. In a word, how is it that all things fade away and vanish in your hands? How is this? Ye cannot otherwise account for it, but that God is displeased with you. If then ye will not of your own 				accord obey God&#8217;s word, let these judgements at least induce you to repent.&#8221; It was to apply the heart to their ways, when they acknowledged that they were thus famished, not by chance, but that the curse of God urged them, or was suspended over their heads. He therefore bids them to receive instruction from the events themselves, or from what they were experiencing; and by these words the Prophet more sharply teaches them; as though he had said, that they profited nothing by instruction and 				warning, and that it remained as the last thing, that they were to be drawn by force while the Lord was chastising them.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.v-p9"></A><a name="v.ii.v-p9.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.v-p10"></A>He says that they had <i>sown much</i>, and that <i>small was the produce</i>. They who render the clause in the future tense, wrest the meaning of the Prophet: for why did he say, apply your heart to your ways, if he only denounced a future punishment? But, as I have already stated, he intimates, that they very thoughtlessly champed the 				bridle, for they perceived not that all their evils were inflicted by God&#8217;s hand, nor did they regard his judgement as righteous. Hence he says, that they had sowed much, and that the harvest had been small; and then, that they <i>ate</i> and <i>were not satisfied</i>; that they <i>drank</i> and had not their <i>thirst quenched</i>; that they <i>clothed themselves </i>and were <i>not warmed</i>. How much soever they applied those things which seemed necessary for the support of life, they yet availed them nothing. And God, we know, does punish men in these two ways either by withdrawing his blessings, by rendering the earth and and the heavens dry; or by making the abundant produce unsatisfying and even useless. It often 				happens that men gather what is sufficient for support, and yet they are always hungry. It is a kind of curse, which appears very evident when God takes away their nourishing power from bread and wine, so that they supply no support to man. When therefore fruit, and whatever the earth produces for the necessities of man, give no support, God proves, as it were by an outstretched arm, that he is an avenger. But the other curse is more frequent; that is, when God smites the earth with drought, so 				that it produces nothing. But our Prophet refers to both these kinds of evils. Behold, he says, <i>Ye have sown much and ye gather little</i>; and then he says, Though ye are supplied with the produce of wine and corn, yet with eating and drinking ye cannot satisfy yourselves; nay, your very clothes do not make you warm. They might have had a sure hope of the greatest abundance, had they not broken off the stream of God&#8217;s favor by their sins. Were they 				not then extremely blind this experience must have awakened them, according to what is said in the first chapter of <a name="v.ii.v-p10.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001">Joe 1:1</a><a name="v.ii.v-p10.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.v-p11"></A>He says at the end of the verse, <i>He who gains wages, gains then for a perforated bag</i>. By these words he reminds them, that the vengeance of God could not only be seen in the sterility of the earth, and in the very hunger of men, who by eating were not satisfied; but also in their work, for they wearied themselves much without any profit, as even the money cast into the bag 				disappeared. Hence he says, even your work is in vain. It was indeed a most manifest proof of God&#8217;s wrath, when their money, though laid up, yet vanished away.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">136</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.v-p15"></A>We now see what the Prophet means: As his doctrine appeared frigid to the Jews and his warnings were despised, he treats them according to the perverseness of their disposition. Hence he shows, that though they disregarded God and his Prophets, they were yet sufficiently taught by his judgements, and that still they remained indifferent. He therefore goads them, as though they were asses, that they might at length acknowledge that God was 				justly displeased with them, and that his wrath was conspicuous in the sterility of the land, as well as in everything connected with their life; for whether they did eat or abstained from food, they were hungry; and when they diligently labored and gathered wages, their wages vanished, as though they had cast them into a perforated bag. It follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="v.ii.vi"></A>

<p><a name="v.ii.vi-p6"></A><a name="v.ii.vi-p6.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.vi-p7"></A>The Prophet now adds, that since the Jews were thus taught by their evils, nothing else remained for them but to prepare themselves without delay for the work of building the Temple; for they were not to defer the time, inasmuch as they were made to know, that God had come forth with an armed hand to vindicate his own right: for the sterility of which he had spoken, and also the famine and other signs of a curse, were like a drawn sword in 				the hand of God; by which it was evident, that he intended to punish the negligence of the people. As God then had been robbed of his right, he not only exhorted the people by his Prophets, but also executed his vengeance on this contempt.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.vi-p8"></A>This is the reason why the Prophet now says, <i>Apply your heart</i>, and then adds, <i>Go up to the mountain, bring wood</i>, <i>etc</i>. And this passage strikingly sets forth why God punished their sins, in order that they might not only perceive that they had sinned, but that they might also 				seek to amend that which displeased God. We may also, in the second place, learn from what is said, how we are to proceed rightly in the course of true repentance. The beginning is, that our sins should become displeasing to us; but if any of us proceed no farther, it will be only an evanescent feeling: it is therefore necessary to advance to the second step; an amendment for the better ought to follow. The Prophet expresses both here: He says first, <i>Lay your heart on 				your ways</i>; that is, &#8220;Consider whence comes this famine to you, and then how it is that by laboring much ye gain nothing, except that God is angry with you.&#8221; Now this was what wisdom required. But he again repeats the same thing, Lay your heart on your ways, that is, &#8220;Not only that sin may be hated by you, but also that this sloth, which has hitherto offended God and provoked his wrath, may be changed into strenuous activity.&#8221; Hence he says, <i>Go 				up to the mountain, and bring wood, and let the house be built</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.vi-p9"></A>If any one is at a loss to know why the Prophet insists so much on building the Temple, the ready answer is this that it was God&#8217;s design to exercise in this way his ancient people in the duties of religion. Though then the Temple itself was of no great importance before God, yet the end was to be regarded; for the people were preserved by the visible Temple in the hope of the future Christ; and then it behaved them always to bear in mind 				the heavenly pattern, that they might worship God spiritually under the external symbols. It was not then without reason that God was offended with their neglect of the temple; for it hence clearly appeared, that there was no care nor zeal for religion among the Jews. It often was the case that they were more sedulous than necessary in external worship, and God scorned their assiduity, when not connected with a right inward feeling; but the gross contempt of God in disregarding even the 				external building, is what is reprehended here by the Prophet.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.vi-p10"></A>He afterwards adds, <i>And I will be propitious in it</i>, or, I will take pleasure in it. Some read, It will please me; and they depart not from the real meaning of the verb: for <a name="v.ii.vi-p10.1"></A>&#1512;&#1510;&#1492;, <i>retse</i> &#8212; is to be acceptable. But more 				correct, in my view, is the opinion of those who think that the Prophet alludes to the promise of God; for he had said, that he would on this condition dwell among the Jews, that he might hear their prayers, and be propitious to them. As, then, the Jews came to the Temple to expiate their sins, that they might return to God&#8217;s favor, it is not without reason that God here declares that he would be propitious in that house.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.vi-p11"></A>&#8216;If any one sin,&#8217; said Solomon, &#8216;and entering this house, shall humbly pray, do thou also hear from thy heavenly habitation.&#8217; <br> 				(<a name="v.ii.vi-p11.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#030">1Ki 8:30</a><a name="v.ii.vi-p11.2"></A>.)</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.vi-p12"></A>We further know that the covering of the ark was called the propitiatory, because God there received the suppliant into favor. This meaning, then, seems the most suitable &#8212; that the Prophet says, that if the Temple was built, God would be there propitious. But it was a proof of extreme impiety to think that they could prosper while God was adverse to them: for whence could they hope for happiness, except from the only 				fountain of all blessings, that is, when God favored them and was propitious to them? And how could his favor be sought, except they came to his sanctuary, and thence raise up their minds by faith to heaven? When, therefore, there was no care for the Temple, it was easy to conclude that God himself was neglected, and regarded almost with scorn. We then see how emphatically this was added, <i>I will be propitious there</i>, that is, in the Temple; as 				though he had said, &#8220;Your infirmity ought to have reminded you that you have need of this help, even of worshipping me in the sanctuary. But as I gave you, as it were, a visible mirror of my presence among you, when I ordered a Temple to be built for me on mount Sion, when ye despise the Temple, is it not the same as though I was rejected by you?&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.vi-p13"></A>He then adds, <i>And I shall be glorified, saith Jehovah</i>. He seems to express the reason why he should be propitious; for he would then see that his glory was regarded by the Jews. At the same time, this reason may be taken by itself, and this is what I prefer.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">137</FONT></A>
 				 The Prophet then employs two goads to awaken the Jews: When the Temple was built, God would bless them; for they would have him pacified, and whenever they found him displeased, they might come as suppliants to seek pardon; this was one reason why it behaved them strenuously to undertake the building of the Temple. The second reason was, that God would be glorified. Now, what could have been more inconsistent than to disregard God their deliverer, and so late a 				deliverer too? But how God was glorified by the Temple I have already briefly explained; not that it added anything to God; but such ordinances of religion were then necessary, as the Jews were as yet like children. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="v.ii.vii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="v.ii.vii-p1"></A><a name="v.ii.vii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009">Haggai 1:9</a><a name="v.ii.vii-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="v.ii.vii-p2"></A><b>9.</b> Ye looked for much, and, lo, <i>it came</i> to little; and when ye brought <i>it</i> home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the Lord of hosts. Because of mine house that <i>is</i> waste, and ye run every man unto his own 					 house.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="v.ii.vii-p3"></A><b>9.</b> Respexistis ad multum, et ecce parum; et intulistis ad domum, et sufflavi in illud: cur hoc? dicit Iehova exercituum: Propter domum meam quae est deserta, et vos curritis (vel, addicti estis quisque domi suae) quisque in domum suam.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="v.ii.vii-p4"></A><a name="v.ii.vii-p4.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.vii-p5"></A>Here the Prophet relates again, that the Jews were deprived of support, and that they in a manner pined away in their distress, because they robbed God of the worship due to him. He first repeats the fact, <i>Ye have looked for much, but behold little</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">138</FONT></A>
 				 It may happen that one is contented with a very slender portion, because much is not expected. They who are satisfied with their own penury are not anxious though their portion of food is but scanty, though they are constrained to feed on acorns. Those who are become hardened in enduring evils, do not seek much; but they who desire much, are more touched and vexed by their penury. This is the reason why the Prophet says, Ye have looked for much, and, behold, there 				was but little; that is, &#8220;Ye are not like the peasants, who satisfy themselves with any sort of food, and are not troubled on account of their straitened circumstances; but your desire has led you to seek abundance. Hence ye seek and greedily lay hold on things on every side; but, behold, it comes to little.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.vii-p13"></A>In the second place he adds, <i>Ye have brought it home</i>. He farther mentions another kind of evil &#8212; that when they gathered wine, and corn, and money, all these things immediately vanished. <i>Ye have brought it home, and I have blown upon it</i>. By saying that they brought it home, he intimates that what they had acquired was laid 				up, that it might be preserved safely; for they who had filled their storehouses, and wine-cellars, and bags, thought that they had no more to do with God. Hence it was that profane men securely indulged themselves; they thought that they were beyond the reach of danger, when their houses were well filled. God, on the contrary, shows that their houses became empty, when filled with treasures and provisions. But he speaks still more distinctly &#8212; that he had blown upon them, that is, that he had 				dissipated them by his breath: for the Prophet did not deem it enough historically to narrate what the Jews had experienced; but his purpose also was to point out the cause, as it were, by the finger. He therefore teaches us, that what they laid in store in their houses did not without a cause vanish away; but that this happened through the blowing of God, even because he cursed their blessing, according to what we shall hereafter see in the Prophet Malachi.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.vii-p14"></A>He then adds, <i>Why is this? saith Jehovah of hosts</i>. God here asks, not because he had any doubts on the subject, but that he might by this sort of goading rouse the Jews from their lethargy, &#8212; &#8220;Think of the cause, and know that my hand is not guided by a blind impulse when it strikes you. You ought, then, to consider the reason why all things thus decay and perish.&#8221; Here 				again is sharply reproved the stupidity of the people, because they attended not to the cause of their evils; for they ought to have known this of themselves.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.vii-p15"></A>But God gives the answer, because he saw that they remained stupefied &#8212; <i>On account of my house</i>, he says, <i>because it is waste</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">139</FONT></A>
 				 God here assigns the cause; he shows that though no one of them considered why they were so famished, the judgement of his curse was yet sufficiently manifest, on account of the Temple remaining a waste. And you, he says, run, every one to his own house. Some read, You take delight, every one in his own house; for it is the verb <a name="v.ii.vii-p16.4"></A>&#1512;&#1510;&#1492;, <i>retse</i>, which we have lately noticed; and it means either to take pleasure in a thing, or to run. Every one, then, runs to his house, or, Every one delights in his house. But it is more suitable to the context to give this rendering, Every one runs to his house. For the Prophet here reminds the Jews that they were slow and slothful in the work of building the Temple, because they hastened to their private houses. He then reproves here their ardor in being 				intent on building their own houses, so that they had no leisure to build the Temple. This is the hastening which the Prophet blames and condemns in the Jews.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.vii-p17"></A>We may hence learn again, that they had long delayed to build the sanctuary after the time had arrived: for, as we have mentioned yesterday, they who think the Jews returned in the fifty-eighth year, and that they had not then undergone the punishment denounced by Jeremiah, are very deluded; for they thus obscure the favor of God; nay, they wholly subvert the truth of the promises, as though they had returned contrary to God&#8217;s will, 				through the permission of Cyrus, when yet Isaiah says, that Cyrus would be the instrument of their promised redemption. (<a name="v.ii.vii-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#005">Isa 45:5</a><a name="v.ii.vii-p17.1"></A>.) Surely, then, Cyrus must have been dead before the time was fulfilled! and in that case God could not have been the redeemer of his people. Therefore Eusebius, and those who agree with him, did thus most absurdly confound the order of time. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="v.ii.viii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="v.ii.viii-p1"></A><a name="v.ii.viii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#010">Hag. 1:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#011">11</a><a name="v.ii.viii-p1.1"></A></p>

<p><a name="v.ii.viii-p4"></A><b>11. </b>And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon <i>that</i> which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="v.ii.viii-p5"></A><b>11.</b> Et vocavi siccitatem super terram, et super montes, et super triticum, et super mustum (aut, vinium,) et super omne quod profert terra, et super hominem, et super animal, et super omnem laborem manuum.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="v.ii.viii-p6"></A><a name="v.ii.viii-p6.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.viii-p7"></A>He confirms what the last verse contains &#8212; that God had made it evident that he was displeased with the people because their zeal for religion had become cold, and, especially, because they were all strangely devoted to their own interest and manifested no concern for building the Temple. Hence, he says, <i>therefore the heavens </i>are shut up and <i>withhold the dew</i>; that is, they distil no dew on the earth; and he adds, that the earth was closed that it produced no fruit; it yielded no increase, and disappointed its cultivators. As to the particle <a name="v.ii.viii-p7.1"></A>&#1506;&#1500;-&#1499;&#1503;, <i>ol-can</i>, we must bear in mind what I have stated, that God did not regard the external and 				visible Temple, but rather the end for which it was designed; for it was his will then that he should be worshipped under the ceremonies of the law. When, therefore, the Jews offered mutilated, lame, or diseased sacrifices, they manifested impiety and contempt of God. It is yet true, that it was the same thing as to God; but he had not commanded sacrifices to be offered to him for his own sake, but that by such services they might foster true religion. When, therefore, he says now, that he 				punished their neglect of the Temple, we ought ever to regard that as a pattern of heavenly things, so that we may understand that the coldness and indifference of the Jews were reproved; because it hence evidently appeared that they had no care for the worship of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.viii-p8"></A>With respect to the withholding of dew and of produce, we know that the Prophets took from the law what served to teach the people, and accommodated it to their own purposes. The curses of the law are general. (<a name="v.ii.viii-p8.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#017">De 11:17</a><a name="v.ii.viii-p8.1"></A>.) It is therefore the same thing as though the Prophet had said, that what God 				had threatened by Moses was really fulfilled. It ought not to have been to them a new thing, that whenever heaven denied its dew and rain it was a sign of God&#8217;s wrath. But as, at this day, during, wars, or famine, or pestilence, men do not regard this general truth, it is necessary to make the application: and godly teachers ought wisely to attend to this point, that is, to remind men, according to what the state of things and circumstances may require, that God proves by facts what he has 				testified in his word. This is what is done by our Prophet now, <i>withheld have the heavens the dew and the earth its produce</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">140</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.viii-p15"></A>In a word, God intimates, that the heavens leave no care to provide for us, and to distil dew so that the earth may bring forth fruit, and that the earth also, though called the mother of men, does not of itself open its bowels, but that the heavens as well as the earth bear a sure testimony to his paternal love, and also to the care which he exercises over us. God then shows, both by the heavens and the earth, that he provides for us; 				for when the heavens and the earth administer and supply us with the blessings of God, they thus declare his love towards us. So also, when the heaven is, as it were, iron, and when the earth with closed bowels refuses us food, we ought to know that they are commissioned to execute on us the vengeance of God. For they are not only the instruments of his bounty, but, when it is necessary, God employs them for the purpose of punishing us. This is briefly the meaning.</p>  <a name="v.ii.ix"></A>

<p><a name="v.ii.ix-p2"></A>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou kindly and graciously invites us to thyself, we may not wait until thou stimulates us with goads, but cast aside our sloth and run quickly to thee.

<p><a name="v.ii.xi-p4"></A><a name="v.ii.xi-p4.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xi-p5"></A>The Prophet here declares that his message had not been without fruit, for shortly after the whole people prepared themselves for the work. And he names both Zerubbabel and Joshua; for it behaved them to lead the way, and, as it were, to extend a hand to others. For, had there been no leaders, no one of the common people would have pointed out the way to the rest. We know what usually happens when a word is addressed indiscriminately to all 				the people: they wait for one another. But when Joshua and Zerubbabel attended to the commands of the Prophet, the others followed them: for they were dominant, not only in power, but also in authority, so that they induced the people willingly to do their duty. One was the governor of the people, the other was the high priest; but the honesty and faithfulness of both were well known, so that the people spontaneously followed their example.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xi-p6"></A>And this passage teaches us that though God invites all to his service, yet as any one excels in honor or in other respects, so the more promptly he ought to undertake what is proposed by the authority of God. Our Prophet, no doubt, meant to point out this due order of things, by saying, that he was heard first by Zerubbabel and Joshua, and then by the whole people.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xi-p7"></A>But as all had not returned from exile, but a small portion, compared with that great number, which, we know, had not availed themselves of the kindness allowed them &#8212; this is the reason why the Prophet does not simply name the people, but <i>the remnant of the people</i>, <a name="v.ii.xi-p7.1"></A>&#1513;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501;, <i>sharit eom</i>. As also the gift of prophecy had been for a long time more rare, and few appeared among the people who had any decided evidence of their call, such as Samuel, Isaiah, David, and others possessed, the Prophet, for this reason, does here more carefully commend and honor his own office: he says that the people attended to <i>the voice of Jehovah </i>&#8212; How? By attending, he says, <i>to the words of Haggai the Prophet, inasmuch as Jehovah their God had sent him</i>. He might have said more shortly that his labor had not been without fruit; but he used this circuitous mode of speaking, that he might confirm his own call; and he did this designedly, because the people had for a long time been without the opportunity of hearing God&#8217;s Prophets, for there were none among them.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xi-p8"></A>But Haggai says nothing here but what belongs in common to all teachers in the Church: for we know that men are not sent by divine authority to speak that God himself may be silent. As then the ministers of the word derogate nothing from the authority of God, it follows that none except the only true God ought to be heard. It is not then a peculiar expression, which is to be restricted to one man, when God is said to have 				spoken by the mouth of Haggai; for he thus declared that he was God&#8217;s true and authorised Prophet. We may therefore gather from these words, that the Church is not to be ruled by the outward preaching of the word, as though God had substituted men in his own place, and thus divested himself of his own office, but that he only speaks by their mouth. And this is the import of these words, <i>The people attended to the voice of Jehovah their God, and to the words of Haggai 				the Prophet</i>. For the word of God is not distinguished from the words of the Prophet, as though the Prophet had added anything of his own. Haggai then ascribed these words to himself, not that he devised anything himself, so as to corrupt the pure doctrine which had been delivered to him by God, but that he only distinguished between God, the author of the doctrine, and his minister, as when it is said,</p>  			 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.ii.xi-p9"></A>"The sword of God and of Gideon,&#8221; (<a name="v.ii.xi-p9.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#020">Jud 7:20</a><a name="v.ii.xi-p9.1"></A>,)</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xi-p10"></A>and also,</p>  			 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.ii.xi-p11"></A>&#8220;The people believed God and Moses his servant.&#8221; <br> 				(<a name="v.ii.xi-p11.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031">Ex 14:31</a><a name="v.ii.xi-p11.2"></A>.)</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xi-p12"></A>nothing is ascribed to Moses or to Gideon apart from God; but God himself is placed in the highest honor, and then Moses and Gideon are joined to him. In the same sense do the Apostles write, when they say, that &#8220;it had pleased the Holy spirit&#8221; and themselves. (<a name="v.ii.xi-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022">Ac 15:22</a><a name="v.ii.xi-p12.1"></A>.)</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xi-p13"></A>And hence it is evident how foolish and ridiculous are the Papists, who hence conclude that it is lawful for men to add their own inventions to the word of God. For the Apostles, they say, not only alleged the authority of the Holy Spirit, but also say, that it seemed good to themselves. God then does not so claim, they say, all things for himself, as not to leave some things to the decision of his Church, as though indeed the Apostles 				meant something different from what our Prophet means here; that is, that they truly and faithfully delivered what their had received from the spirit of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xi-p14"></A>It is therefore a mode of speaking which ought to be carefully marked, when we hear, that the voice of God and the words of Haggai were reverently attended to by the people. &#8212; Why? <i>Inasmuch</i>, he says, <i>as God had sent him</i>; as though he had said, that God was heard when he spoke by the mouth of man. And this is also worthy of 				being noticed, because many fanatics boast, that they allow regard to the word of the Lord, but are unwilling to give credit to men, as that would be even preposterous; and they pretend, that in this way what belongs to the only true God is transferred to creatures. But the Holy Spirit most easily reconciles these two things &#8212; that the voice of God is heard when the people embrace what they hear from the mouth of a Prophet. Why so? because it pleases God thus to try the obedience of our faith, 				while he commits to man this office. For if the Lord was pleased to speak himself, then justly might men be neglected: but as he has chosen this mode, whosoever reject God&#8217;s Prophets, clearly show that they despise God himself. There is no need of inquiring here, why it is that we ought to obey the word preached or the external voice of men, rather than revelations; it is enough for us to know that this is the will of God. When therefore he sends Prophets to us, we ought unquestionably to 				receive what they bring.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xi-p15"></A>And Haggai says also expressly, that he was sent by the God of Israel; as though he had said, that the people had testified their true piety when they acknowledged God&#8217;s Prophet in his legitimate vocation. For he who clamorously objects, and says that he knows not whether it pleases God or not to send forth men to announce his word, shows himself to be wholly alienated from God: for it ought to be sufficiently evident to us that this is 				one of our first principles.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xi-p16"></A>He afterwards adds, that <i>the people feared before Jehovah</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">141</FONT></A>
 				 Haggai confirms here the same truth &#8212; that the people received not what they heard from the mouth of mortal man, otherwise than if the majesty of God had openly appeared. For there was no ocular view of God given; but the message of the Prophet obtained as much power as though God had descended from heaven, and had given manifest tokens of his presence. We may then conclude from these words, that the glory of God so shines in his word, that we ought to be so much 				affected by it, whenever he speaks by his servants, as though he were nigh to us, face to face, as the Scripture says in another place. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="v.ii.xii"></A>

<p><a name="v.ii.xii-p6"></A><a name="v.ii.xii-p6.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xii-p7"></A>The Prophet tells us here, that he had again roused the leaders as well as the common people; for except God frequently repeats his exhortations, our alacrity relaxes. Though then they had all attended to God&#8217;s command, it was yet necessary that they should be strengthened by a new promise: for men can be encouraged, and their indifference can be corrected, by no other means, to such a degree, as when God offers and 				promises his help. This, then, was the way in which they were now encouraged, <i>I am with you</i>. And experience sufficiently shows, that we never really and from the heart obey, except when we rely on his promises and hope for a happy success. For were God only to call us to our work, and were our hope doubtful, all our zeal would doubtless die away. We cannot then devote our services to God, except he supports and encourages us by promises. We also 				see, that it is not enough that God should speak once, and that we should once receive his word, but there is need that he should rouse us again and again; for the greatest ardor grows cold when no goads are applied.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xii-p8"></A>And the Prophet makes known again his vocation, for he says, that <i>he spake in the message of Jehovah</i>, for he was his messenger. The word <a name="v.ii.xii-p8.1"></A>&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498;, <i>malak</i>, means a messenger; and as angels are called <a name="v.ii.xii-p8.2"></A>&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, <i>melakim</i>, some foolish men have thought that Haggai was one of the celestial angels, clothed with the form of man: but this is a most frivolous conjecture; for priests, we know, are honored with this title in the second chapter of Malachi, <a name="v.ii.xii-p8.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#001">Mal 2:1</a><a name="v.ii.xii-p8.3"></A>, and God in many other places calls his Prophets messengers or ambassadors. There is, therefore, no doubt but that Haggai meant simply to testify, that he brought forward nothing presumptuously, but was a faithful dispenser of the word; for he knew that he was sent by God; and that he might attain attention, he was able justly to testify that his message came from heaven.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xii-p9"></A>Hence he says, that he spake as a <i>messenger of Jehovah in the message of Jehovah</i>; that is, he spoke according to his calling, and not as a private individual, but as one who derived his authority from heaven, and could call to order the whole people; for he was to give way neither to the chief priest nor to Zerubbabel the ruler of the people, inasmuch as he was superior to 				them on this account, because he had a message which had been committed to him by God.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_141"><FONT SIZE="1">142</FONT></A>
 				 We now then understand the design of the Prophet.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xii-p13"></A>And we hence learn that there is no dignity which exempts us from obedience common to all, when God&#8217;s word is addressed to us. Doubtless Joshua the high priest was superior to all the rest in matters of religion, and he was the chief angel or messenger of the God of hosts; and yet he refused not to submit himself to God&#8217;s Prophet, for he understood that he was in a special manner appointed by God to this office. Zerubbabel, the governor 				of the people, followed also his example. Let us, then, know that God&#8217;s word is proclaimed under this condition, that no eminence, either in honor or in dignity, exempts us, as it were, by a sort of privilege, from the obligation of receiving it.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xii-p14"></A>The Prophet at length adds, that the people hastened quickly to the work, because God had given encouragement to them all. He had lately spoken of the fruit of his doctrine; but he now declares that his voice had not so penetrated into the hearts of all, as though it had been of itself efficacious, but that it had been connected with the hidden influence of the Spirit.</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xii-p15"></A>And this passage is remarkable; for the Prophet includes both these things &#8212; that God allows not his word to be useless or unfruitful &#8212; and yet that this proceeds not from the diligence of men, but from the hidden power of the Spirit. The Prophet, then, did not fail in his efforts; for his labor was not in vain, but brought forth fruit. At the same time, that that saying might remain true,</p>  			 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.ii.xii-p16"></A>&#8216;He who plants and he who waters is nothing,&#8217; <br> 				(<a name="v.ii.xii-p16.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#007">1Co 3:7</a><a name="v.ii.xii-p16.2"></A>,)</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xii-p17"></A>he says, that the Israelites were ready for the work, because the Lord roused them; <i>Jehovah</i>, he says, <i>stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the spirit of Joshua, and of the whole people</i>. It is not right to restrict the influence of the Spirit to one thing only, as some do, who imagine that the Israelites were confirmed in 				their good resolution, as they say, having before spontaneously obeyed the word of God. These separate, without reason, what ought to be read in the Prophet as connected together. For God roused the spirit of Zerubbabel and of the whole people; and hence it was that they received the message of the Prophet, and were attentive to his words. Foolishly, then, do they imagine that the Israelites were led by their own free-will to obey the word of God, and then that some aid of the Holy Spirit 				followed, to make them firmly to persevere in their course. But the Prophet declared, in the first place, that his message was respectfully received by the people; and now he explains how it was, even because God had touched the hearts of the whole people.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">143</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xii-p19"></A>And we ought to notice the expression, when it is said that the <i>spirit</i> of Zerubbabel and of all the people was <i>stirred up</i>. For much sloth, we know, prevailed, especially among the multitude. But as to Zerubbabel and Joshua, they were, as we have said, already willing, but delayed until the coldness under which they labored 				was reproved. But the Prophet here simply means, that they became thus obedient through the hidden impulse of God, and also that they were made firm in their purpose. God does not form new souls in us, when he draws us to his service; but changes what is wrong in us: for we should never be attentive to his word, were he not to open our ears; and there would be no inclination to obey, were he not to turn our hearts; in a word, both will and effort would immediately fail in us, were he not to add 				his gift of perseverance. Let us, then, know that Haggai&#8217;s labors produced fruits, because the Lord effectually touched the hearts of the people; for we indeed know that it is his special gift, that the elect are made disciples, according to that declaration,</p>  			 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.ii.xii-p20"></A>&#8216;No one comes to me, except my Father draw him.&#8217; <br> 				(<a name="v.ii.xii-p20.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#024">Joh 6:24</a><a name="v.ii.xii-p20.2"></A>.)</p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xii-p21"></A>It is therefore said that they <i>came and did the work in the house of Jehovah</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="v.ii.xii-p22"></A>We may also hence learn, that no one is fit to offer sacrifices to God, or to do any other service, but he who has been moulded by the hidden operation of the Spirit. Willingly, indeed, we offer ourselves and our all to God, and build his temple; but whence is this voluntary action, except that the Lord subdues us, and thus renders us teachable and obedient? It is afterwards added &#8212;</p>  <a name="v.ii.xiii"></A>

<p><a name="v.ii.xiii-p5"></A>The Prophet mentions even the time when they commenced the building of the temple. Three-and-twenty days interposed between the first message and the beginning of the work. It hence appears how ignorant he was who divided the chapters, having begun the second chapter at this verse, where the Prophet shows, as it were by his finger, how much was the distance between the day in which he began to exhort the people, and the success of which 				he speaks. He then simply tells us here when the Temple began to be built &#8212; that is, in the second year of Darius the king, and in the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month. He had previously said that a message was given to him in the second year of Darius the king, and in the sixth month, and on the first day. Then from that day to the twenty-fourth the people delayed; not that they disregarded the command of the Prophet, but because it was not so easy a thing to persuade them all, that they 				might unanimously undertake the work. Though then the promptitude of the people is commended, we must yet observe that there was some mixture of weakness; for the effect of the doctrine did not appear till the twenty-fourth day.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">144</FONT></A>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="v.ii.v-p12"></A> There seems to be an irregularity in the construction of the whole verse. Literally it is as follows &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="v.ii.v-p13"></A>Ye have sown much, but the coming in is little; <br> 					 There is eating, but not to satisfaction; <br> 					 They drink, but not to fullness; <br> 					 There is clothing, but there is no warmth in it; <br> 					 And earn does the earner for a perforated bag.</p>  				  
<p><a name="v.ii.v-p14"></A>This change in the mode of construction takes away the monotony which would have otherwise appeared. The word [<a name="v.ii.v-p14.1"></A>&#1492;&#1489;&#1488;], [<a name="v.ii.v-p14.2"></A>&#1488;&#1499;&#1493;&#1500;], and [<a name="v.ii.v-p14.3"></A>&#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1513;], are not infinitives, as some suppose, but participles used as nouns; which is often the case in Hebrew, as well as in Welsh, and often to in English, such as teaching, drinking, clothing, etc. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="v.ii.vi-p14"></A> The whole verse may be thus rendered &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="v.ii.vi-p15"></A>Ascend the mountains, for ye have brought wood; <br> 					 And build the house, that I may delight in it, <br> 					 That I may be glorified, saith Jehovah.</p>  				  
<p><a name="v.ii.vi-p16"></A>The [<a name="v.ii.vi-p16.1"></A>&#1493;], <i>vau</i>, here in two instance may have the meaning of <a name="v.ii.vi-p16.2"></A><i>ut</i><i>,</i> that; but before [<a name="v.ii.vi-p16.3"></A>&#1492;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514;&#1501;], a verb in the perfect tense, it must be rendered &#8220;for,&#8221; or, &#8220;as;&#8221; and the clause seems to be a parenthesis. The [<a name="v.ii.vi-p16.4"></A>&#1493;], <i>vau</i>, is not conversive when preceded by a verb in the imperative mood, as it appears from the end of the verse. The mount was not Libanus, as 					 many have supposed, but Sion, where wood had been previously brought, but was not used. See <a name="v.ii.vi-p16.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#007">Ezr 3:7</a><a name="v.ii.vi-p16.5"></A>. As to the verb [<a name="v.ii.vi-p16.6"></A>&#1512;&#1510;&#1492;], followed by [<a name="v.ii.vi-p16.7"></A>&#1489;], it means to approve, to be pleased 					 with, or to take pleasure or delight in, a thing. See <a name="v.ii.vi-p16.8"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#003">2Ch 29:3</a><a name="v.ii.vi-p16.8"></A>; <a name="v.ii.vi-p16.9"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#010">Ps 147:10</a><a name="v.ii.vi-p16.9"></A>; <a name="v.ii.vi-p16.10"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#007">Mic 6:7</a><a name="v.ii.vi-p16.10"></A>. Probably the best rendering of the two last lines is the 					 following &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="v.ii.vi-p17"></A>And build the house, and I shall delight in it <br> 					 And render it glorious, saith Jehovah.</p>  				  
<p><a name="v.ii.vi-p18"></A>To take the last verb in a causative sense is more consistent with the tenor of the passage. This is the meaning given by the Targum, and is adopted by <i>Dathius.</i> &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="v.ii.vii-p6"></A> The first word in this verse, [<a name="v.ii.vii-p6.1"></A>&#1508;&#1504;&#1492;], is evidently a participle noun; similar instances we find in verse 6. The verse, literally rendered, is as follows &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="v.ii.vii-p7"></A>Looking for much, and behold little! <br> 					 And you brought it home, and I blew upon it; <br> 					 On what account this, saith Jehovah of hosts? <br> 					 On account of my house, because it is waste, <br> 					 And ye are running, each to his own house.</p>  				  
<p><a name="v.ii.vii-p8"></A>The first line is put in an absolute form, as is sometimes the case in Hebrew; &#8220;There has been,&#8221; or some such words being understood. Both the Targum and the Septuagint read [<a name="v.ii.vii-p8.1"></A>&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;] instead of [<a name="v.ii.vii-p8.2"></A>&#1492;&#1504;&#1492;], which would be 					 more suitable to the word which follows, which has [<a name="v.ii.vii-p8.3"></A>&#1500;] before it. The line would then be &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="Center"><a name="v.ii.vii-p9"></A><i>There has been </i>looking for much, but it came to little.</p>  				  
<p><a name="v.ii.vii-p10"></A>The &#8220;blowing&#8221; seems to be a metaphor taken from scorching wind, blowing on vegetation, and causing it to wither. The last line may be thus rendered &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="Center"><a name="v.ii.vii-p11"></A>And ye <i>are </i>delighted, each with his own house.</p>  				  
<p><a name="v.ii.vii-p12"></A> &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="v.ii.vii-p16"></A> This is the literal rendering &#8212; &#8220;On account of my house, because it is waste.&#8221; [<a name="v.ii.vii-p16.1"></A>&#1488;&#1513;&#1512;] is not &#8220;which&#8221; here, for it is followed by [<a name="v.ii.vii-p16.2"></A>&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;], &#8220;it;&#8221; but a conjunction, &#8220;because.&#8221; The word <a name="v.ii.vii-p16.3"></A><i>quod</i>, in Latin, admits of two similar meanings. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="v.ii.viii-p9"></A> <i>Calvin </i>seems to have overlooked [<a name="v.ii.viii-p9.1"></A>&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;], &#8220;on your account.&#8221; The verse is &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="v.ii.viii-p10"></A>Therefore, on your account, withheld have the heavens from dew, <br> 					 And the earth has withheld its produce.</p>  				  
<p><a name="v.ii.viii-p11"></A>The verb [<a name="v.ii.viii-p11.1"></A>&#1499;&#1500;&#1488;], to restrain, to keep back, to withhold, is used here twice, and in the first line in an intransitive sense, and in the second in a transitive sense, as it is often the case in other languages, when the same verb is both neuter and active.</p>  				  
<p><a name="v.ii.viii-p12"></A>The 11th verse is passed by without any particular remarks. The word [<a name="v.ii.viii-p12.1"></A>&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;] is rendered &#8220;<a name="v.ii.viii-p12.2"></A>Siccitas &#8212; drought,&#8221; as <i>Jerome</i> does, and also our version, as well 					 as <i>Newcome</i> and <i>Henderson</i>; but <i>Grotius</i> and also <i>Marckius</i> very justly observe, that it means here &#8220;waste,&#8221; or &#8220;desolation,&#8221; it being the same word as is applied to God&#8217;s house in verse 9. They left his house a waste; by a just retribution he had brought or called for a waste on the land, etc. The 					 contrast is so evident that it cannot be denied. The ideal meanings of the word is to be waste or desolate: it is then applied to various things which produce desolation, the sword, drought, pestilence, etc.; but it is used here in its primary sense, and the contrast is very striking: &#8220;My house has been left waste; I have caused a waste to come upon every thing else.&#8221; The verse may be thus rendered &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="v.ii.viii-p13"></A>And I have called for a waste <br> 					 On the land and on the mountains, <br> 					 And on the corn and on the wine and on the oil, <br> 					 And on whatever the ground produces, <br> 					 And on man and on the cattle, <br> 					 And on all the labor of the hands.</p>  				  
<p><a name="v.ii.viii-p14"></A>&#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="v.ii.xi-p17"></A> This clause may be thus rendered, &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="v.ii.xi-p18"></A>And fear him did the people on account of Jehovah.</p>  				  
<p><a name="v.ii.xi-p19"></A>This comports better with the previous clause, that Jehovah had sent him. The [<a name="v.ii.xi-p19.1"></A>&#1493;] affixed to &#8220;fear&#8221; is a pronoun, otherwise the verb is plural; and &#8220;people&#8221; seldom, if ever, has a verb in the plural number. To fear sometimes means to respect, to reverence: the people honored him as God&#8217;s servant, by obeying his 					 message. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_141"></A><A HREF="cc29014.htm#fr_141">142</A> <a name="v.ii.xii-p9.1"></A>   				  
<p class="Footnote"><a name="v.ii.xii-p10"></A> The verse literally is &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="v.ii.xii-p11"></A>Then said Haggai, the messenger of Jehovah in the message of <br> 					 Jehovah to the people, saying,<br> 					 I am with you, saith Jehovah.</p>  				  
<p><a name="v.ii.xii-p12"></A>The word for &#8220;messages&#8221; is in the plural number, preceded by the preposition [<a name="v.ii.xii-p12.1"></A>&#1489;]. Why commentators have generally rendered it in the singular number, does not appear. Haggai is expressly said to be God&#8217;s messenger in, or with regard to, the messages or communications he made to the people. To connect the word, as 					 some do, with &#8220;said,&#8221; hardly gives a meaning, except the clause be rendered, as it is done by <i>Newcome</i>, &#8220;by the message of Jehovah,&#8221; that is, by his command; but then a plural word is made singular. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_142"></A><A HREF="cc29014.htm#fr_142">143</A> <a name="v.ii.xii-p17.1"></A>   				  
<p class="Footnote"><a name="v.ii.xii-p18"></A> It is sometimes the case, that a doctrine is illegitimately drawn from a passage, and then that it is unfairly opposed. The building of the Temple had nothing to do with the first movement of the spiritual life: and therefore to draw an argument from the willingness of the people to undertake that work in favor of free-will in the great business of salvation, is by no means legitimate. It would have been, then, better to 					 deny the application, than to turn the passage from its regular course. But we shall not do violence to the passage, if we render the [<a name="v.ii.xii-p18.1"></A>&#1493;] at the beginning of this verse, &#8220;Thus,&#8221; and refer &#8220;the stiring up&#8221; to the threatening and the promise previously announced. The object seems not to have been to set forth the direct influence of the Spirit on the minds of the people, but to show the 					 effect produced on them by the message conveyed to them from the Lord by the Prophet. God stirs up the minds of men both by his word and by his Spirit, both outwardly and inwardly. The former may more properly be meant here. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_143"></A><A HREF="cc29014.htm#fr_143">144</A> <a name="v.ii.xiii-p5.1"></A>   				  
<p class="Footnote"><a name="v.ii.xiii-p6"></A> The reasons assigned here for a different division is by no means satisfactory. The fact is that this verse necessarily belongs to the last of the previous chapter, as it specifies the time when the people began the work as there mentioned; and what follows this verse is another message, and at another time. The usual division is no doubt the best.</p> 				</P>
