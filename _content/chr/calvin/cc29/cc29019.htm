<p><a name="vi.iii.i-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, saying &#8212; This people say, &#8220;The time is not come To build the house of Jehovah.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="vi.iii.i-p6"></A><b>4 </b>&#8220;Is it time for you To dwell yourselves in your boarded houses, And this house a waste!&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.i-p7"></A><b>5 </b>And now thus saith Jehovah of hosts, &#8212; Apply your heart to your ways:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.i-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Ye have sown much, and brought in little; Ye have eaten, and were not satisfied; Ye have drank, and were not replenished; Ye have clothed yourselves, and were not warmed; And he who gains wages, Gains wages for a perforated bag. (<b>330</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.i-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, &#8212; Apply your heart to your ways;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.i-p10"></A><b>8 </b>Ascend unto the mountain and bring wood, And build the house; And I will be <i>to you</i> propitious in it, And glorified shall I be, saith Jehovah. (<b>333</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.i-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Ye have looked for much, but behold little! And ye brought it home, and I blew on it: Why is this? saith Jehovah; On account of my house, because it is waste, And ye run, each of you to his own house.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.i-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Therefore restrained over you Are the heavens from dew; And the earth from producing is restrained:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.i-p13"></A><b>11 </b>Yea, I have called for drought On the land and on the mountains, And on the corn and the wine and the oil, And on everything which the earth produces, On man and on beast, And on every labour of the hands. (<b>338</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.i-p14"></A><b>12 </b>And Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Josedech, the high priest, and all the residue of the people, attended to the voice of Jehovah, their God, and to the words of Haggai, the Prophet, as Jehovah their God had sent him; and the people feared Jehovah.</p>

<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>According to the word I covenanted with you, When ye came forth from Egypt, And my Spirit shall be in the midst of you, fear ye not. (<b>354</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, &#8212; Yet for a little while shall be this,</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>And I will shake the heavens and the earth, Also the sea and the dry land: Yea, I will shake all nations, And come shall the choice things of all nations; And I will fill this house with glory, Saith Jehovah of hosts:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>Mine the silver and mine the gold, Saith Jehovah of hosts:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Greater shall be the glory Of this latter house than that of the former, Saith Jehovah of hosts; And in this place will I give peace, Saith Jehovah of hosts.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>On the twenty-fourth of the ninth <i>month</i>, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah to Haggai, the Prophet, saying, &#8212;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Ask the priests respecting the law, saying, &#8212;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>If a man carry holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any eatable, shall it be made holy? And the priests answered and said, No.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Then said Haggai, If any one polluted in his person touch any of these things, shall it be polluted? The priests answered and said, It shall be polluted.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p16"></A>14 Then answered Haggai, and said, &#8212; So is this people, and so is this nation, In my sight, saith Jehovah; And so is every work of their hands, And what they offer, &#8212; it is polluted.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p17"></A>15 And now I pray, lay it to heart, &#8212; From this day and beyond it, Before a stone was laid on a stone In the temple of Jehovah, &#8212;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p18"></A><b>16 </b>Before this time, when one came To a heap of twenty, there were but ten <i>measures</i>, When he came to the vat to draw fifty, There were from the vat but twenty <i>vessels</i>:</p>  			 
<p class="Super"><a name="vi.iii.ii-p19"></A><b>17 </b>I smote you with blasting and mildew and hail, As to every work of you hands; And ye turned not to me, saith Jehovah.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p20"></A><b>18 </b>Lay it, I pray, to your heart, &#8212; From this day and beyond it, From the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, From the day the temple of Jehovah was founded; &#8212; Lay it to your heart, &#8212;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p21"></A><b>19 </b>Is there now seed in the barn? And as yet the vine and the fig tree, And the pomegranate and the olive, Have produced nothing; &#8212; From this day will I bless you. (<b>378</b>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p22"></A><b>20 </b>And the word of Jehovah came again to Haggai, on the twenty-fourth of the month, saying, &#8212;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p23"></A><b>21 </b>Speak to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, saying, &#8212;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p24"></A><b>22 </b>I will shake the heavens and the earth, And will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, And destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; Yea, I will overthrow chariots and their riders, And down shall come the horses and their riders, Every one by the sword of his brother:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.iii.ii-p25"></A><b>23 </b>In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, I will take the Zerubbabel, The son of Shealtiel, my servant, saith Jehovah, And I will make thee as a signet, For I have chosen thee, saith Jehovah of hosts.</p>
