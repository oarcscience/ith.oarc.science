<p><a name="v.i-p2"></A>After the return of the people, they were favored, we know, especially with three Prophets, who roused their fainting hearts, and finished all predictions, until at length the Redeemer came in his appointed time. During the time of The Babylonian Exile the office of teaching was discharged among the captives by Ezekiel, and also by Daniel; and there were others less celebrated; for we find that some of the Psalms were then composed, either by the 			 Levites, or by some other teachers. But these two, Ezekiel and Daniel, were above all others eminent. Then Ezra and Nehemiah followed them, the authority of whom was great among the people; but we do not read that they were endued with the Prophetic gift.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p3"></A>It then appears certain that three only were divinely inspired to proclaim the future condition of the people.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p4"></A>Daniel had before them foretold whatever was to happen till the coming of Christ, and his Book is a remarkable mirror of God&#8217;s Providence; for he paints, as on a tablet, three things which were to be fulfilled after his death, and of which no man could have formed any conjecture. He has given even the number of years from the return of the people to the building of the Temple, and also to the death of Christ. But we must come to the other 			 witnesses, who confirmed the predictions of Daniel. The Lord raised up three witnesses &#8212; Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">125</FONT></A>

 			 condemned the sloth of the people; for, being intent on their own advantages, they all neglected the building of the Temple; and he shows that they were deservedly suffering punishment for their ingratitude; for they despised God their Deliverer, or at least honored him less than they ought to have done, and deprived him of the worship due to him. He then encouraged them to hope for a complete restoration, and showed that there was no reason for them to be disheartened by 			 difficulties, and that though they were surrounded by enemies, and had to bear many evils, and were terrified by threatening edicts, they ought yet to have entertained hope; for the Lord would perform the work which he had begun &#8212; to restore their ancient dignity to his people, and Christ also would at length come to secure the perfect happiness and glory of the Church.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.i-p8"></A>This is the sum of the whole. I now come to the words.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="v.i-p5"></A> "Prophecy ceased with these Prophets until the time of Christ. For it was God&#8217;s purpose, by this <i>famine of the word</i>, (according to the prophetic language,) to render the Jews more desirous (<a name="v.i-p5.1"></A><i>appetentiores</i>) of the Messiah, who was to surpass all the Prophets in the power of doing miracles.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Grotius.</i></p> 			 </P>

He was sent particularly to encourage the Jews to proceed with the building of the temple, which had been interrupted for about <i>fourteen </i>years.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Adam Clarke.</i></p> 			 </P>
