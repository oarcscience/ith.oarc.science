<p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p8"></A>The Prophet speaks here again against Jerusalem; for first, the Jews ought ever to have been severely reproved, as they were given to many sins; and secondly, because there was always there some seed which needed consolation: and this has been the way pursued, as we have hitherto seen, by all the Prophets. But we must also bear in mind, that the books now extant were made up of prophetic addresses, that we might understand what was the sum 				of the doctrine delivered.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p9"></A>The Prophet here makes this charge against the Jews, that they were <i>polluted and become filthy</i>. And he addresses Jerusalem, where the sanctuary was; and it might therefore seem to have been superior to other cities; for God had not in vain chosen that as the place for his worship. But the Prophet shows how empty and fallacious was any boasting of this kind; for the city 				which God had consecrated for himself had polluted itself with many sins. The Prophet seems to allude to the ancient rites of the law, which, though many, had been prescribed, we know, by God, that the people might observe a holy course of life: for the ceremonies could not of themselves wash away their filth; but the people were instructed by these external things to worship God in a holy and pure manner. As then they often washed themselves with water, and as they carefully observed other 				rites of outward sanctity, the Prophet derides their hypocrisy, for they did not regard the real design of the ceremonies. Hence he says, that they were polluted, though in appearance they might be deemed the most pure; for they were defiled as to their whole life.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">106</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p15"></A>He adds that the city was <a name="iv.iv.ii-p15.1"></A>&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, <i>eiune</i>; some render it the city of dove, or, a dove; for the word has this meaning: and they take it metaphorically for a foolish and thoughtless city, as we find it to be so understood in <a name="iv.iv.ii-p15.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011">Ho 7:11</a><a name="iv.iv.ii-p15.2"></A>; where Ephraim was said to be a dove, because the people were void of reason and knowledge, and of their own accord exposed themselves to traps and snares. Some then consider this place to have this meaning, &#8212; that Jerusalem, which ought to have been wise, was yet wholly fatuitous and foolish. But it may be easily gathered from the context, that the Prophet means another thing, even this, &#8212; that Jerusalem was 				given to plunder and fraud; for the verb <a name="iv.iv.ii-p15.3"></A>&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, <i>ine</i>, signifies to defraud and to take by force what belongs to another; and it means also to circumvent as well as to plunder. He therefore means no doubt, that Jerusalem was a city full of every kind of iniquity, as he had before called it a polluted city; and then he adds an 				explanation.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p16"></A>The Prophet in the first verse seems to have in view the two tables of the law. God, we know, requires in the law that his people should be holy; and then he teaches the way of living justly and innocently. Hence when the Prophet called Jerusalem a polluted city, he meant briefly to show that the whole worship of God was there corrupted, and that no regard for true religion flourished there; for the Jews thought that 				they had performed all their duty to God, when they washed away their filth by water. Such was the extremely foolish notion which they entertained: but we know and they ought to have known that the worship of God is spiritual. He afterwards adds, that the <i>city was rapacious</i>, under which term he includes every kind of injustice.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p17"></A>It follows, <i>She heard not the voice, she received not correction</i>. The Prophet now explains and defines what the pollution was of which he had spoken: for true religion begins with teachableness; when we submit to God and to his word, it is really to enter on the work of worshipping him aright. But when heavenly truth is despised, though men may toil much in outward rites, 				yet their impiety discovers itself by their contumacy, inasmuch as they suffer not themselves to be ruled by God&#8217;s authority. Hence the Prophet shows, that whatever the Jews thought of their purity at Jerusalem, it was nothing but filth and pollution. He says, that they were unteachable, because they did not hear the Prophets sent to them by God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p18"></A>This ought to be carefully noticed; for without this beginning many torment themselves in the work of serving God, and do nothing, because obedience is better than sacrifice. If, then, we wish our efforts to be approved by God, we must begin with faith; for except the word of God obtains credit with us, whatever we may offer to him are mere human inventions. It is, in the second place, added, that they did not receive 				correction; and this was no superfluous addition. For when God sees that we are not submissive, and that we do not willingly come to him when he calls us, he strengthens his instruction by chastisements. He allures us at first to himself, he employs kind and gentle invitations; but when he sees us delaying, or even going back, he begins to treat us more roughly and more severely: for teaching without the goads of reproof would have no effect. But when God teaches and reproves in vain, it then 				appears that our disposition is wicked and perverse. So the Prophet intended here to show the wickedness of his people as extreme, by saying, that they <i>heard not the voice nor received correction</i>; as though he had said, that the wickedness of his people was unhealable, for they not only rejected the doctrine of salvation, when offered, but also obstinately rejected all warnings, and would not bear any correction.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p19"></A>But we must bear in mind, that the Prophet had to do with that holy people whom God had chosen as his peculiar treasure. There is therefore no reason why those who profess the name of Christians at this day should exempt themselves from this condemnation; for our condition is not better than the condition of that people. Jerusalem was in an especial manner, as we have already said, the sanctuary, as it were, of God: and yet we see how 				severely the Prophet reproves Jerusalem and all its inhabitants. We have no cause to flatter ourselves, except we willingly submit to God, and suffer ourselves to be ruled by his word, and except we also patiently bear correction, when his teaching takes no suitable effect, and when there is need of sharp goads to stimulate us.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p20"></A>He afterwards adds, that it <i>did not trust in the Lord, nor draw nigh to its God</i>. The Prophet discovers here more clearly the spring of impiety &#8212; that Jerusalem placed not the hope of salvation in God alone; for from hence flowed all the mass of evils which prevailed; because if we inquire how it is that men burn with avarice, why they are insatiable, and why they wantonly 				defraud and plunder one another, we shall find the cause to be this &#8212; that they trust not in God. Rightly then does the Prophet mention this here, among other pollutions at Jerusalem, as the chief &#8212; that it did not put its trust in God. The same also is the cause and origin of all superstitions; for if men felt assured that God alone is enough for them, they would not follow here and there their own inventions. We hence see that unbelief is not only the mother of all the evil deeds by which men 				willfully wrong and injure one another, but that it is also the cause of all superstitions.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p21"></A>He says, in the last place, that it <i>did not draw nigh to God</i>. The Prophet no doubt charges the Jews that they willfully departed from God when he was nigh them; yea, that they wholly alienated themselves from him, while he was ready to cherish them, as it were, in his own bosom. This is indeed a sin common to all who seek not God; but Jerusalem sinned far more grievously, 				because she would not draw nigh to God, by whom she saw that she was sought. For why was the law given, why was adoption vouchsafed, and in short, why had they the various ordinances of religion, except that they might join themselves to God? &#8216;And now Israel,&#8217; said Moses, &#8216;what does the Lord thy God require of thee, except to cleave to him?&#8217; God thus intended his law to be, as it were, a sacred bond of union between him and the Jews. Now when they wandered here and there, that they might not be 				united to him, it was a diabolical madness. Hence the Prophet here does not only accuse the Jews of not seeking God, but of withdrawing themselves from him; and thus they were ungovernable. The Lord sought to tame them; but they were like wild beasts. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iv.iv.iii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="iv.iv.iii-p1"></A><a name="iv.iv.iii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003">Zephaniah 3:3</a><a name="iv.iv.iii-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p2"></A><b>3.</b> Her princes within her <i>are</i> roaring lions; her judges <i>are</i> evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p3"></A><b>3.</b> Principes ejus in medio ejus, leones rugientes; judices ejus lupi vespertini, non lacerant ad mane (<i>alii</i> non differunt, <i>nempe ossa comminuer</i>e; <i>sed</i> [&#1501;&#1512;&#1490;], <i>proprie</i> <i>significat</i>, conterere <i>vel</i>, frangere <i>ergo de ossibus loquitur Propheta</i>,<i> quod scilicet non expectarent usque ad mane</i>,<i> ut ipsa contererent dentibus</i>; <i>sed prae 					 fame</i>,<i> vel potius rabie praedam statim lacerarent</i>; <i>imo etiam contererent ossa dentibus</i>.)</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iv.iv.iii-p5"></A><a name="iv.iv.iii-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p6"></A>The Prophet now explains what we have stated respecting plunder and fraud. He confirms that he had not without reason called Jerusalem <a name="iv.iv.iii-p6.1"></A>&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, <i>eiune</i>, a rapacious city, or one given to plunder; for the princes were like lions and the judges like wolves. And when he 				speaks of judges, he does not spare the common people; but he shows that all orders were then corrupt: for though no justice or equity is regarded by the people, there will yet remain some shame among the judges, so as to retain the people at least within some limits, that an extreme licentiousness may not prevail: but when robbery is practiced in the court of justice, what can be said of such a city? We hence see that the Prophet in these words describes an extreme confusion: The princes of 				Jerusalem, he says, are lions. And we have elsewhere similar declarations; for the Prophets, when it was their object to condemn all from the least to the greatest, did yet direct their discourse especially to the judges.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p7"></A>And this is worthy of being noticed, for there was then no Church of God, except at Jerusalem. Yet the Prophet says, that the judges, and prophets, and priests, were all apostates. What comfort could the faithful have had? But we hence see that the fear of God had not wholly failed in his elect, and that they firmly and with an invincible heart contended against all offenses and trials of this kind. Let us also learn to fortify ourselves 				at this day with the same courage, so that we may not faint, however much impiety may everywhere prevail, and all religion may seem extinct among men.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p8"></A>But we may also hence learn, how foolishly the Papists pride themselves in their vain titles, as though they thought that God was bound as it were to them, because they have bishops and pastors. But the Prophet shows, that even those who performed the ordinary office of executing the laws could yet be the wicked and perfidious despisers of God. He also shows, that neither prophets nor priests ought to be spared; for when God sets them 				over his Church, he gives them no power to tyrannize, so that they might dare to do anything with impunity, and not be reproved. For though the priesthood under the law was sacred, we yet see that it was subject to correction. So let no one at this day claim for himself a privilege, as though he was exempt from all instruction and reproof, while occupying a high station among the people of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.iii-p9"></A>He distinguishes between princes and judges; and the reason is, because the kingdom was as yet standing. So the courtiers, who were in favor and authority with the king, drew a part of the spoil to themselves, and the judges devoured another part. Though Scripture often makes no difference between these two names, yet I doubt not but he means by <a name="iv.iv.iii-p9.1"></A>&#1513;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <i>sherim</i>, princes, the chiefs who were courtiers; and he calls them <a name="iv.iv.iii-p9.2"></A>&#1513;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, <i>shepthim</i>, judges, who administered justice. And he says that the judges were evening wolves, that is, hungry, for wolves become furious in the evening when they 				have been roaming about all day and have found nothing. As their want sharpens the savageness of wolves, so the Prophet says that the judges were hungry like evening wolves, whose hunger renders them furious. And for the same purpose he adds, that they <i>broke not the bones in the morning</i>; that is, they waited not till the dawn to break the bones;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">107</FONT></A>
 				 for when they devoured the flesh they also employed their teeth in breaking the bones, because their voracity was so great. We now apprehend the Prophet&#8217;s meaning. It afterwards follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iv.iv.iv"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="iv.iv.iv-p1"></A><a name="iv.iv.iv-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004">Zephaniah 3:4</a><a name="iv.iv.iv-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.iv-p2"></A><b>4.</b> Her prophets <i>are</i> light <i>and</i> treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.iv-p3"></A><b>4.</b> Prophetae ejus leves (<i>vel</i>, futiles,) viri transgressionum; sacerdotes ejus polluerunt sanctum (<i>vel</i>, sanctuarium,) sustulerunt legem.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.iv-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iv.iv.iv-p5"></A><a name="iv.iv.iv-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.iv-p6"></A>The Prophet again reverts to the pollution and filth of which he has spoken in the first verse. He shows that he had not without reason cried against the polluted city; for though the Jews used their washings, they could not yet make themselves clean in this manner before God, as the whole of religion was corrupted by them.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.iv-p7"></A>He says that <i>the Prophets were light</i>. He alone speaks here, and he condemns the many. We hence see that there is no reason why the ungodly should allege their great number, when God by his word accuses them, as the Papists do at this day, who deny it to be right in one or two, or few men, to speak against their impiety, however bad the state of things may be; there must be 				the consent of the whole world, as though the Prophet was not alone, and had not to contend with a great many. It is indeed true that he taught at the same time with the Prophet Jeremiah, as we have elsewhere seen; but yet hardly two or three did then discharge faithfully their office of teaching; and from this and other places we learn that the false Prophets, relying on their number, were on that account bolder. But Zephaniah did not for this reason cease to cry against them. However much 				then the false Prophets raged against him, and terrified him by the show of their number, he still exercised his liberty in condemning them. So at this day, though the whole world should unite in promoting impiety, there is yet no reason why the few should be disheartened when observing the worship of God perverted; but they ought on the contrary to encourage themselves by this example, and strenuously to resist thousands of men if necessary; for no union formed by men can possibly lessen the 				authority of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.iv-p8"></A>It now follows that they were <i>men of transgressions</i>. What we render light, others render empty; (<i>vacuous</i>;) but the word <a name="iv.iv.iv-p8.1"></A>&#1508;&#1493;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501;, <i>puchezim</i>, means strictly men of nought, 				and also the rash, and those who are void of judgment as well as of all moderation. In short, it is the same as though the Prophet had said that they were stupid and blind; and he says afterwards that they were fraudulent, than which there is nothing more inconsistent with the Prophetic office. But Zephaniah shows that the whole order was then so degenerated among the people, that the thickest darkness prevailed among those very leaders whose office it was to bring forth the light of celestial 				truth. And he makes a concession by calling them Prophets. The same we do at this day when we speak of Popish bishops. It is indeed certain that they are unworthy of so honorable a title; for they are blinder than moles, so that they are far from being overseers. We also know, that they are like brute beasts; for they are immersed in their lusts: in short, they are unworthy to be called men. But we concede to them this title, in order that their turpitude may be more apparent. The Prophet did 				the same, when he said, that the Jews did not draw nigh to their God; he conceded to them what they boasted; for they ever wished to be regarded as the holy and peculiar people of God: but their ingratitude did hence become more evident, because they went back and turned to another object, when God was ready to embrace them, as though they designedly meant to show that they had nothing to do with him. It is then the same manner of speaking, that Zephaniah adopts here, when he says, that the 				Prophets were light and men of transgressions.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">108</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.iv-p13"></A>He then adds, The priests have polluted the holy place. The tribe of Levi, we know, had been chosen by God; and those who descended from him, were to be ministers and teachers to others: and for this reason the Lord in the law ordered the Levites to be dispersed through the whole country. He might indeed have given them as to the rest, a fixed habitation; but his will was, that they should be dispersed among the whole 				population, that no part of the land should be without good and faithful ministers. The Prophet now charges them, that they had polluted the holy place. By the word <a name="iv.iv.iv-p13.1"></A>&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;, <i>kodash</i> the Prophet means whatsoever is holy; at the same time he speaks of the sanctuary. Moreover, since the sanctuary was as it were the dwelling-place of God, when the 				Prophets speak of divine worship and religion, they include the whole under the word, Temple, as in this place. He says then that the sanctuary was polluted by the priests, and then that they took away or subverted the law.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">109</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.iv-p16"></A>We here see how boldly the Prophet charges the priests. There is then no reason why they who are divinely appointed over the Church should claim for themselves the liberty of doing what they please; for the priests might have boasted of this privilege, that without dispute everything was lawful for them. But we see that God not only calls them to order by his Prophets, but even blames them more than others, because they 				were less excusable. Now the Papists boast, that the clergy, even the very dregs collected from the filthiest filth, cannot err; which is extremely absurd; for they are not better than the successors of Aaron. But we see what the Prophet objects now to them, &#8212; that they <i>subverted the law</i>: he not only condemns their life, but says also, that they were perfidious towards God; for they strangely corrupted the whole truth of religion. The Papists 				confess, that they indeed can sin, but that the sin dwells only in their moral conduct. They yet seek to exempt themselves from all the danger of going astray. Though the Levitical priests were indeed chosen by the very voice of God, we yet see that they were apostates. But God confirms the godly, that they might not abandon themselves to impiety, though they saw their very leaders going astray, and rushing headlong into ruin. For it behaved the faithful to fortify themselves with constancy, 				when the priests not only by their bad conduct withdrew the people from every fear of God, but also perverted every sound doctrine; it behaved, I say, the faithful to remain then invincible. Though then at this day those who hold the highest dignity in the Church neglect God and even despise every celestial truth, and thus rush headlong into ruin, and though they attempt to turn God&#8217;s truth into falsehood, yet let our faith continue firm; for John has not without reason declared, that it ought 				to be victorious against the whole world. <a name="iv.iv.iv-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004">1Jo 5:4</a><a name="iv.iv.iv-p16.1"></A>. It follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iv.iv.v"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="iv.iv.v-p1"></A><a name="iv.iv.v-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#005">Zephaniah 3:5</a><a name="iv.iv.v-p1.1"></A></p>

<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iv.iv.v-p5"></A><a name="iv.iv.v-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.v-p6"></A>Here the Prophet throws back against hypocrites what they were wont to pretend, when they sought wickedly to reject every instruction and all warnings; for they said, that God dwelt in the midst of them, like the Papists at the present day, who raise up this as their shield against us, &#8212; that the Church is the pillar of the truth. Hence they think that all their wicked deeds are defended by this covering. So the Jews at that time had this 				boast ever on their lips, &#8212; We are notwithstanding the holy people of God, and he dwells in the midst of us, for he is worshipped in the Temple, which has been built, not according to men&#8217;s will, but by his command; for that voice proceeded not from earth, but came from heaven, &#8216;This is my rest for ever, here will I dwell.&#8217; <a name="iv.iv.v-p6.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014">Ps 132:14</a><a name="iv.iv.v-p6.1"></A>. Since then the Jews were inflated with this presumption, the Prophet 				concedes what they claimed, that God dwelt among them; but it was for a far different purpose, which was, that they might understand, that his hand was nigh to punish their sins. This is one thing.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.v-p7"></A>Jehovah is in the midst of them; Granted, he says; I allow that he dwells in this city; for he has commanded a temple to be built for him on Mount Sion, he has ordered a holy altar for himself; but why does God dwell among you, and has preferred this habitation to all others? Surely, he says, <i>he will not do iniquity</i>. Consider now what the nature of God is; for when he 				purposed to dwell among you, he certainly did not deny himself, nor did he cease to be what he is. There is therefore no reason for you to imagine, as though God intended, for the sake of those to whom he bound himself, to throw aside his own justice, or intended to pollute himself by the defilements of men. He warns the Jews, that they absurdly blended these things together. <i>God</i> then <i>who dwells in the midst of you, will 				not do iniquity</i>; that is, He will not approve of your evil deeds; and though he may for a time connive at them, he will not yet bear with them continually. Do not therefore foolishly flatter yourselves, as though God were the approver of your wickedness.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.v-p8"></A>Some apply this to the people, &#8212; that they ought not to have done iniquity; but this is a strained exposition, and altogether foreign to the context. Most other interpreters give this meaning, that God is just and will do no iniquity, for he had sufficient reasons for executing his vengeance on a people so wicked. They hence think, that the Prophet anticipates the Jews, lest they murmured, as though the Lord was cruel or 				too rigid. He will not do iniquity, that is, Though the Lord may inflict on you a most grievous punishment, yet he cannot be arraigned by you as unjust; and ye in vain contend with him, for he will ever be found to be a righteous judge. But this also is a very frigid explanation. Let us bear in mind what I have already said, &#8212; that the Prophet here, by way of irony, concedes to the Jews, that God dwelt among them, but afterwards brings against them what they thought was a protection to them, &#8212; 				God dwells in the midst of you; I allow it, he says; but is not he a just God? Do not then dream that he is one like yourselves, that he approves of your evil deeds. God will not do iniquity; ye cannot prevail with him to renounce himself, or to change his own nature. Why then does God dwell in the midst of you? <i>In the morning, in the morning, he says, his judgment will he bring forth to light</i>; the Lord will daily bring forth his judgment. How 				this is to be understood, we shall explain tomorrow.</p>  <a name="iv.iv.vi"></A>

<p><a name="iv.iv.vi-p2"></A>Grant, Almighty God, that inasmuch as thou hast deigned to favor us with an honor so invaluable, as to adopt us for a holy people to thee, and to separate us from the world, &#8212; O grant, that we may not close our eyes against the light of thy truth, by which thou showest to us the way of salvation; but may we with true docility follow where thou callest us, and never cast away the fear of thy majesty, nor mock thee with frivolous ceremonies, but 				strive sincerely to devote ourselves wholly to thee, and to cleanse ourselves from all defilements, not only of the flesh, but also of the spirit, that by thus seeking true holiness, we may aspire after and diligently labor for that heavenly perfection, from which we are as yet far distant; and may we in the meantime, relying on the favor of thy only-begotten Son, lean on thy mercy; and while depending on it, may we ever grow up more and more into that true and perfect union, reserved for us in 				heaven, when we shall be made partakers of thy glory, through Christ our Lord.

<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref26"><a name="iv.iv.vii-p1"></A>Lecture One Hundred and Twenty-fifth</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.vii-p2"></A>We began yesterday to explain the passage, where the Prophet says, that God dwelt at Jerusalem, but that he was notwithstanding just, and could not possibly associate with the ungodly and the wicked, because he changes not his nature to suit the humor of men.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.vii-p3"></A>It now follows, <i>In the morning, in the morning, his judgment will he bring forth to light</i>: by which words he means, either that God would be the avenger of wickedness, which seems to escape, as it were, his eyes, while he delays his punishment, or that he is ready to restore his people, whenever they are attentive to instruction. If the former view be approved, the sense 				will be this, &#8212; that hypocrites foolishly flatter themselves, when God spares them; for he will suddenly ascend his tribunal that he may visit them with punishment. Some however choose to apply this to the judgments executed on the Gentiles, of which the Jews had not once nor twice been reminded, but often, that they might in time repent. But there is no doubt but that the Prophet refers here to a judgment belonging to the Jews.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.vii-p4"></A>Let us now see whether this judgment is pronounced or inflicted. It would not ill suit the passage to understand it of the vengeance which God was hastening to execute, for the Jews were worthy of what had been severely threatened, because they falsely professed his name; and while they absurdly boasted that he dwelt among them, they withdrew themselves very far from him. It is however no less suitable to refer this to teaching, so that 				the Prophet thus enhanced the sin of the people, because they had hardened themselves after so many and so constant warnings, which continually sounded in their ears, as God elsewhere complains, that though he rose early, and indeed daily, this solicitude had been without its fruit. The verb in the future tense will thus signify a continued act, for God ceased not to exhort to repentance those wretched beings who had ears which were deaf. And this view strikingly corresponds with what 				immediately follows, that he fails not; for such a perseverance was a proof of unwearied mercy, when God continued to send Prophets one after the other.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.vii-p5"></A>He now adds, <i>The wicked knows no shame</i>. He means what he has just referred to &#8212; that the people had become so hardened in their wickedness that they could not be reformed, either by instruction or by threats, or by the scourges of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.vii-p6"></A>If we refer judgment to teaching, which I approve, the meaning will be &#8212; that though God, by making known daily his law, kindled as it were a lamp, which discovered all evils, yet the ungodly were not ashamed. But if we understand it, as they say, of actual judgment, the meaning will be in substance the same &#8212; that the ungodly repented not, though the hand of God openly appeared; and though he rose to judgment, yet he says, they knew not 				what it was to feel ashamed. As to the main subject there is no ambiguity; for the Prophet means only that the people were past recovery; for though God proved himself a judge by manifest evidences, and even by his own law, they yet felt no shame, but went on in their wicked courses. The word judgment, in the singular number, seems to have been put here in the sense of a rule, by which men live religiously and justly, and a rule which ought to make men ashamed.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">110</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iv.iv.viii-p8"></A>Here the Prophet shows in another way that there was no hope for a people, who could not have been instructed by the calamities of others, to seek to return to God&#8217;s favor. For God here complains that he had in vain punished neighboring nations, and made them examples, in order to recall the Jews to himself. Had they been of a sane mind they might have been led, by their quiet state, while God spared them, to consider what they had 				deserved &#8212; If this is done in the green tree, what at length will be done in the dry? They might then have thought within themselves, that a most grievous calamity was at hand, except they anticipated God&#8217;s wrath, which had grown ripe against them; and God also testified that he intended by such examples to stay the judgment which he might have already justly executed on them. As they then even hastened it, it is evident that their wickedness was past remedy. This is the sum of the whole.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.viii-p9"></A>He says first, I <i>have cut off nations</i>; by which words he shows that he warned the Jews to repent, not only by one example, but by many examples; for not one instance only of God&#8217;s wrath had appeared, but God had on all sides manifested himself to be a judge, in inflicting punishment on one nation after another. Since then they had been so often warned, we may hence learn 				that they were wholly blinded by their wickedness.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.viii-p10"></A>He now enhances the atrocity of the punishment inflicted, and says, that <i>citadels had been demolished and streets cut off, that no one passed through</i>; and then, that <i>cities had been reduced to solitude, so that there was no inhabitant</i>. For when punishment is of an ordinary kind, it is wont, for the most part, to be 				disregarded; but when God showed, by so remarkable proofs, that he was displeased with the nations, that is, with the ignorant, who in comparison with the Jews were innocent, how could such an instance as this be disregarded by the Jews, whom God thus recalled to himself, except that they were of a disposition wholly desperate and irreclaimable? We now then see why the Prophet enlarges on the punishments which, having been inflicted on the nations, ought to have been considered by the 				Jews.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">111</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.viii-p14"></A>He now subjoins the object which God had in view, <i>I said, Surely thou wilt fear me</i>. Here God assumes the character of man, as he does often elsewhere: for he does not wait for what is future, as though he was doubtful; but all things, as we know, are before his eyes. Hence God was not deceived, as though something had happened beyond his expectation; but as I have 				already said, he undertakes here the character of man; for he could not otherwise have sufficiently expressed how inexcusable the Jews were who had despised all his warnings. For what was God&#8217;s design when he punished the heathens, one nation after another, except that the Jews might be awakened by the evils of others, and not provoke his wrath against themselves? Paul makes use of the same argument.</p>  			 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iv.viii-p15"></A>&#8216;On account of these things,&#8217; he says, <br> 				&#8216;the wrath of God comes upon all the unbelieving.&#8217; <br> 				<a name="iv.iv.viii-p15.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017">Ro 1:17</a><a name="iv.iv.viii-p15.3"></A>.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.viii-p16"></A>Inasmuch as men for the most part deceive themselves by self-flatteries and cherish with extreme indulgence their own wickedness, Paul says, that the wrath of God comes on the unbelieving: and it is a singular proof of God&#8217;s love, that he does not immediately assail us, but sets before us the examples of others. As when any one lays hold of his servant in the presence of his son, and punishes him severely, the son must be moved by the 				sight, except he be wholly an abandoned character: however, in such a case the father&#8217;s love manifests itself; for he withholds his hand from his son and inflicts punishment on the servant, and this for the benefit of his son, that he may learn wisdom by what another suffers. God declares in this place that he had done the same; but he complains that it had been without benefit, for the Jews had frustrated his purpose.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.viii-p17"></A>It may be here asked, whether men so frustrate God that he looks for something different from what happens. I have already said, that God speaks after the manner of men, and in a language not strictly correct: and hence we ought not here to enter or penetrate into the secret purpose of God, but to be satisfied with this reason, &#8212; that if we profit nothing when God warns us either by his word or by his scourges, we are 				then equally guilty, as though he was deceived by us: and hence also the madness of those is reproved, who are unwilling to ascribe anything to God but what is conveyed in these common forms of speech: God says, that he wills the salvation of all, <a name="iv.iv.viii-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004">1Ti 2:4</a><a name="iv.iv.viii-p17.1"></A>;) hence there is no election, which makes a distinction between one man and another; but the Lord leaves the whole human 				race to their free-will, so that every one may provide for himself as he pleases; otherwise the will of God must be twofold. So unlearned men vainly talk; and such not only show their ignorance in religion, but are also wholly destitute of common sense. For what is more absurd than to conclude, that there is a twofold will in God, because he speaks otherwise with us than is consistent with his incomprehensible majesty? God&#8217;s will then is one and simple, but manifold as to the perceptions of 				men; for we cannot comprehend his hidden purpose, which angels adore with reverence and humility. Hence the Lord accommodates himself to the measure of our capacities, as this passage teaches us with sufficient clearness. For if we receive what the fanatics imagine, then God is like man, who hopes well, and finds afterwards that he has been deceived: but what can be more alien to his glory? We hence see how these insane men not only obscure the glory of God, but also labor, as far as they can, 				to reduce his whole essence to nothing. But this mode of speaking ought to be sufficiently familiar to us, &#8212; that God justly complains that he has been deceived by us, when we do not repent, inasmuch as he invites us to himself, and even stimulates us, <i>I said, Surely thou wilt fear me</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.viii-p18"></A>This word <i>said</i>, ought not then to be referred to the hidden counsel of God, but to the subject itself, and that is, that it was time to repent. Who would not have hoped but that you would have returned to the right way? When the next house was on fire, how was it possible for you to sleep, except ye were extremely stupid? And when so many examples were presented before 				your eyes without any advantage, it is evident that there is no more any hope of repentance. Thou, then, wilt fear me; that is, God might have hoped for some amendment, though he had not yet touched you even with his smallest finger; for ye beheld, while in a tranquil state, how severely he punished the contempt of his justice as to the heathens. He uses a similar language in <a name="iv.iv.viii-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004">Isa 5:4</a><a name="iv.iv.viii-p18.1"></A>,</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.viii-p19"></A>&#8216;My vine, what have I done to thee? or what could I have done to thee more than what I have done? I expected thee to bring forth fruit; but, behold, thou hast brought forth wild grapes.&#8217;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.viii-p20"></A>God in that passage expostulates with the Jews as though they had by their perfidiousness deceived him. But we know, that whatever happens was known to him before the creation of the world: but, as I have already said, the fact itself is to be regarded by us, and not the hidden judgment of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.viii-p21"></A>He afterwards adds, <i>Thou wilt receive correction</i>; that is, thou wilt be hereafter more tractable: for monstrous is our stupidity, when we fear not God&#8217;s vengeance; when yet it evidently appears that we are warned, as I have already said, to repent, by all the examples of judgments which are daily presented to us. But if we proceed in our wickedness, what else is it but 				to kick against the goad, as the old proverb is? In short, we here see described an extreme wickedness and obstinacy, which admitted of no remedy.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.viii-p22"></A>Hence the Prophet adds again, <i>And cut off should not be her habitation, howsoever I might have visited her</i>; that is, though the Jews had already provoked me, so that the punishment they have deserved was nigh; yet I was ready to withdraw my hand and to forgive them, if they repented: not that God ever turns aside from his purpose, for there is no shadow of turning in 				him; but he sets before them the fact as it was; for the subject here, as I have said, is not respecting the secret purpose of God, but we ought to confine ourselves to the means which he employs in promoting our salvation. God had already threatened the Jews for many years; he had as yet deferred to execute what he had threatened. In the meantime his wrath had been manifested through the whole neighborhood; the heathen nations had suffered the severest judgments. God here declares, that he had 				been so lenient to his people as to give time to repent; and he complains that he had delayed in vain, for they had gone on in their wickedness, and had mocked, as it were, his patience. When, therefore, he says, <i>Cut off should not </i>be her habitation, <i>howsoever I might have visited her</i>, or have visited her, he pursues still the same mode of speaking, that is, that he was prepared to forgive the 				Jews, though he had before destined them to destruction; not that he, as to himself, would retract that sentence; but that he was still reconcilable, if the Jews had been touched by any feeling of repentance.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">112</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.viii-p30"></A>He at last adds, <i>Surely</i>, (some render it, <i>but</i>,) <i>surely they have hastened</i>. The verb <a name="iv.iv.viii-p30.1"></A>&#1513;&#1499;&#1501;, <i>shecam</i>, means properly 				to rise early, but is to be taken metaphorically in the sense of hastening; as though he had said, They run headlong to corrupt their ways. God had said that he had been indulgent to them for this end &#8212; that he might lead them by degrees to repentance: now he complains, that they on the contrary had run another way, when they saw that he suspended his judgments, as though it was their designed object to accelerate his wrath. Thus they hastened to corrupt their ways. The meaning, then, is that 				this people were not only irreclaimable in their obstinacy, but that they were also sottish and presumptuous, as though they wished to hasten the judgment, which the Lord was ready for a time to defer. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iv.iv.ix"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="iv.iv.ix-p1"></A><a name="iv.iv.ix-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008">Zephaniah 3:8</a><a name="iv.iv.ix-p1.1"></A></p>

<p><a name="iv.iv.ix-p6"></A>God here declares that the last end was near, since he had found by experience that he effected nothing by long forbearance, and since he had even found the Jews becoming worse, because he had so mercifully treated them. Some think that the address is made to the faithful, that they might prepare themselves to bear the cross; but this view is foreign to the subject of the Prophet: and though this view has gained the consent of almost all, 				I yet doubt not but that the Prophet, as I have now stated, breaks out into a complaint, and says, that God would not now deal in words with a people so irreclaimable.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.ix-p7"></A><i>Look for me</i>, he says; that is, I am now present fully prepared: I have hitherto endeavored to turn you, but your hearts have become hardened in depravity. But inasmuch as I have lost all my labor in teaching, warning, and exhorting you, even when I presented to you examples on every side among heathen nations, which ought to have stimulated you to repentance, and inasmuch as I have effected 				nothing, it is now all over with you &#8212; <i>Look for me</i>: I shall no more contend with you, nor is there any ground for you to hope that I shall any more send Prophets to you.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.ix-p8"></A><i>Look </i>then <i>for me, until I shall rise </i>&#8212; for what purpose? <i>to the prey</i>. Some render the word <a name="iv.iv.ix-p8.1"></A>&#1500;&#1506;&#1491;, <i>laod</i>, forever; but the Prophet means, that God was so offended with the contumacy o&uacute; the people, that he would now plunder, spoil and devour, and forget his kindness, which had been hitherto a sport to them &#8212; I shall come as a wild beast; as lions rage, lacerate, tear, and devour, so also will I now do with you; for I have hitherto too kindly and paternally spared you. We hence see that these things are not to be referred to the hope and patience of the godly; but that God on the 				contrary does here denounce final destruction on the wicked, as though he had said &#8212; I bid you adieu; begone, and mind your own concerns; for I will no longer contend with you; but I shall shortly come, and ye shall find me very differentfrom what I have been to you hitherto. We now see that God, as it were, repudiates the Jews, and threatens that he would come to them with a drawn sword; and at the same time he compares himself to a savage and cruel wild beast.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.ix-p9"></A>He afterwards adds &#8212; <i>For my judgment is</i>; that is, I have decreed to <i>gather all nations</i>. We have elsewhere spoken of this verb <a name="iv.iv.ix-p9.1"></A>&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, <i>asaph</i>; it is the same in Hebrew as 				the French <i>trousser</i>. It is then my purpose to gather, that is, to heap together into one mass <i>all nations</i>, to <i>assemble the kingdoms</i>, so that no corner of the earth may escape my hand. But he speaks of all nations and kingdoms, that the Jews might understand that his judgment could no longer be deferred; for if a comparison be made between them and 				the heathen nations, judgment, as it is written, is wont to begin with the house of God, <a name="iv.iv.ix-p9.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017">1Pe 4:17</a><a name="iv.iv.ix-p9.2"></A>; and further, they were less excusable than the unbelieving, who went astray, which is nothing strange, in darkness, for they were without the light of truth. God then threatens nations and kingdoms, that the Jews might know that a most dreadful punishment was impending over their 				heads, for they had surpassed all others in wickedness and evil deeds.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">113</FONT></A>

<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iv.iv.x-p5"></A><a name="iv.iv.x-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.x-p6"></A>The Prophet now mitigates the asperity of his doctrine, which might have greatly terrified the godly; nay, it might have wholly disheartened them, had no consolation been applied. God then moderates here what he had previously threatened; for if the Prophet had only said this &#8212; My purpose is to gather all the nations, and thus the whole earth shall be devoured by the fire of indignation, what could the faithful have concluded but that they 				were to perish with the rest of the world? It was therefore necessary to add something to inspire hope, such as we find here.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.x-p7"></A>We must at the same time bear in mind what I have reminded you of elsewhere &#8212; that the Prophet directs his discourse one while to the faithful only, who were then few in number, and that at another time he addresses the multitude indiscriminately; and so when our Prophet threatens, he regards the whole body of the people; but when he proclaims the favor of God, it is the same as though he turned his eyes towards the faithful only, and 				gathered them into a place by themselves. As for instance, when a few among a people are really wise, and the whole multitude unite in hastening their own ruin, he who has an address to make will make a distinction between the vast multitude and the few; he will severely reprove those who are thus foolish, and live for their own misery; and he will afterwards shape his discourse so as to suit those with whom he has not so much fault to find. Thus also the Lord changes his discourse; for at one 				time he addresses the ungodly, and at another he turns to the elect, who were but a remnant. So the Prophet has hitherto spoken by reproofs and threatening, for he addressed the whole body of the people; but now he collects, as I have said, the remnant as it were by themselves, and sets before them the hope of pardon and of salvation.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.x-p8"></A>Hence he says, <i>But then</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">114</FONT></A>
 				 (for I take <a name="iv.iv.x-p15.1"></A>&#1499;&#1497;, <i>ki</i>, as an adversative) <i>will I turn to the people a pure lip</i>. God intimates that he would propagate his grace wider, after having cleansed the earth; for he will be worshipped not only in Judea, but by foreign nations, 				and even by the remotest. For it might have been objected, Will God then extinguish his name in the world? For what will be the state of things when Judea is overthrown and other nations destroyed, except that God&#8217;s name will be exposed to reproach! It will nowhere be invoked, and all will outvie one another in blasphemies against him. The Prophet meets this objection, and says, that God has in his own hand the means by which he will vindicate his own glory; for he will not only defend his 				Church in Judea, but will also gather into it nations far and wide, so that his name shall be everywhere celebrated.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.x-p16"></A>But he speaks first of a pure lip, <i>I will turn</i>, he says, <i>to the nations a pure lip</i>. By this word he means, that the invocation of God&#8217;s name is his peculiar work; for men do not pray through the suggestion of the flesh, but when God draws them. It is indeed true, that God has ever been invoked by all nations; but it was not 				the right way of praying, when they heedlessly cast their petitions into the air: and we also know, that the true God was not invoked by the nations; for there was no nation then in the world which had not formed for itself some idol. As then the earth was full of innumerable idols, God was not invoked except in Judea only. Besides, though the unbelieving had an intention to pray to God, yet they could not have prayed rightly, for prayer flows from faith. God then does not without reason 				promise, that he would turn pure lips to the nations; that is, that he would cause the nations to call on his name with pure lips. We hence then learn what I have stated &#8212; that God cannot be rightly invoked by us, until he draws us to himself; for we have profane and impure lips. In short, the beginning of prayer is from that hidden cleansing of the Spirit of which the Prophet now speaks.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.x-p17"></A>But if it be God&#8217;s singular gift, to turn a pure lip to the nations, it follows that faith is conferred on us by him, for both are connected together. As God then purifies the hearts of men by faith, so also he purifies their lips that his name may be rightly invoked, which would otherwise be profaned by the unbelieving. Whenever they pretend to call on God&#8217;s name, it is certain that it is not done without profanation.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.x-p18"></A>As to the word <i>all</i>, it is to be referred to nations, not to each individual; for it has not been that every one has called on God; but there have been some of all nations, as Paul also says in the first chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians <a name="iv.iv.x-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001">1Co 1:1</a><a name="iv.iv.x-p18.1"></A>: for in addressing the faithful, he adds, &#8216;With all who call on the name of the Lord in every place&#8217; &#8212; that is, not only in Judea; and elsewhere he says,</p>  			 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iv.x-p19"></A>&#8216;I would that men would stretch forth hands to heaven in every place.&#8217; <br> 				(<a name="iv.iv.x-p19.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008">1Ti 2:8</a><a name="iv.iv.x-p19.2"></A>.)</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.x-p20"></A>He afterwards adds, <i>That they may serve him with one shoulder</i>; that is, that they may unitedly submit to God in order to do him service; for to serve him with the shoulder is to unite together, so as to help one another. The metaphor seems to have been derived from those who carry a burden; for except each assists, one will be overpowered, and then the burden will fall to 				the ground. We are said then to serve God with one shoulder when we strive by mutual consent to assist one another. And this ought to be carefully noticed, that we may know that our striving cannot be approved by God, except we have thus the same end in view, and seek also to add courage to others, and mutually to help one another. Unless then the faithful thus render mutual assistance, the Lord cannot approve of their service.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">115</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iv.iv.x-p22"></A>We now see how foolishly they talk who so much extol free-will and whatever is connected with it: for the Lord demands faith as well as other duties of religion; and he requires also from all, love and the keeping of the whole law. But he testifies here that his name cannot be invoked, as the lips of all are polluted, until he has consecrated them, cleansing by his Spirit what was before polluted: and he shows also that men will not 				undertake the yoke, unless he joins them together, so as to render them willing. I must not proceed farther.</p>  <a name="iv.iv.xi"></A>

<p><a name="iv.iv.xiii-p6"></A>Interpreters agree not as to the meaning of this verse; for some of the Hebrews connect this with the former, as though the Prophet was still speaking of the calling of the Gentiles. But others, with whom I agree, apply this to the dispersed Jews, so that the Prophet here gives hope of that restoration, of which he had before spoken. They who understand this of the Gentiles, think that Atharai and Phorisai are proper names. But in the 				first place, we cannot find that any nations were so called; and then, if we receive what they say, these were not separate nations, but portions of the Ethiopians; for the Prophet does not state the fact by itself, that Atharai and Phorisai would be the worshipers of God; but after having spoken of Ethiopia, he adds these words: hence we conclude, that the Prophet means this, &#8212; that they would return into Judea from the farthest region of the Ethiopians to offer sacrifices to God. And as he 				mentions the daughter of the dispersion, we must understand this of the Jews, for it cannot be applied to the Ethiopians. And this promise fits in well with the former verse: for the Prophet spoke, according to what we observed yesterday, of the future calling of the Gentiles; and now he adds, the Jews would come with the Gentiles, that they might unite together, agreeing in the same faith, in the true and pure worship of the only true God. He had said, that the kingdom would be enlarged, for 				the Church was to be gathered from all nations: he now adds, that the elect people would be restored, after having been driven away into exile.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xiii-p7"></A>Hence he says, <i>Beyond the rivers of Ethiopia shall be my suppliants</i>: for <a name="iv.iv.xiii-p7.1"></A>&#1506;&#1514;&#1512;, <i>otar</i>, means to supplicate; but it means also sometimes to be pacified, or to be propitious; and therefore some take <a name="iv.iv.xiii-p7.2"></A>&#1506;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <i>otarim</i>, in a passive sense, they who shall be reconciled to God; as though he had said, God will at length be propitious to the miserable exiles, though they have been cast away beyond the rivers of Ethiopia: they shall yet again be God&#8217;s people, for he will be reconciled to them. As David calls Him the God of his mercy, because he had found him 				merciful and gracious, (<a name="iv.iv.xiii-p7.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#017">Ps 59:17</a><a name="iv.iv.xiii-p7.3"></A>,) so also in this place they think that the Jews are said to be the <a name="iv.iv.xiii-p7.4"></A>&#1506;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;, the reconciled of Jehovah, because he would be reconciled to them. But this exposition is too forced: I therefore retain that which I have stated, &#8212; that some 				suppliants would come to God from the utmost parts of Ethiopia, not the Ethiopians themselves, but the Jews who had been driven there.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xiii-p8"></A>To the same purpose is what is added, <i>The daughter of my dispersed</i>; for <a name="iv.iv.xiii-p8.1"></A>&#1508;&#1493;&#1507;, <i>puts</i>, means to scatter or to disperse.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">116</FONT></A>
 				 Hence by the daughter of the dispersed he means the gathered assembly of the miserable exiles, who for a time were considered as having lost their name, so as not to be counted as the people of Israel. These then <i>shall again offer to me a gift</i>, that is, they are to be restored to their country, that they may there worship me after their usual manner. Now though this prophecy extends to the time of the Gospel, it is 				yet no wonder, that the Prophet describes the worship of God such as it had been, accompanied with the ceremonies of the Law. We now then perceive what Zephaniah means in this verse, &#8212; that not only the Gentiles would come into the Church of God, but that the Jews also would return to their country, that they might together make one body. It follows, &#8212;</p>  <a name="iv.iv.xiv"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p1"></A><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#011">Zephaniah 3:11</a><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p1.1"></A></p>

<p><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p5"></A><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p6"></A>Here the Prophet teaches us, that the Church would be different, when God removed the dross and gathered to himself a pure and chosen people: and the Prophet stated this, that the faithful might not think it hard that God so diminished his Church that hardly the tenth part remained; for it was a sad and a bitter thing, that of a vast multitude a very few only remained. It could not then be, but that the ruin of their brethren greatly 				affected the Jews, though they knew them to be reprobate. We indeed see how Paul felt a sympathy, when he saw that his own nation were alienated from God. <a name="iv.iv.xiv-p6.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001">Ro 9:1</a><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p6.1"></A>. So it was necessary that some consolation should be given to the faithful, that they might patiently bear the diminution of the Church, which had been previously predicted. Hence the Prophet, that he might moderate their grief, says, that this would 				be for their good; for in this manner the reproaches were to be removed, by which the Jewish name had been polluted, and rendered abominable.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p7"></A><i>Thou shalt not be ashamed</i>, he says, <i>for the sins by which I have been offended</i>. Why? For thou shalt be cleansed; for it is God&#8217;s purpose to reserve a few, by whom he will be purely worshipped. Some think that he does not speak here of the remission of sins, but on the contrary, of a pure and holy life, which follows regeneration; as though he had 				said, "There will be no reason any more for thee to be ashamed of thy life; for when I shall chasten you, ye will then fear me, and your correction will be conducive to a newness of life: since then your life will not be the same as formerly, and since my glory shall shine forth among you, there will be no cause why ye should be ashamed.&#8221; But this is a strained view, and cannot be accommodated to the words of the Prophet; for he says, <i>Thou shalt no more be ashamed of 				the sins by which thou hast transgressed against me</i>. We hence see that this cannot be otherwise applied than to the remission of sins. But the last clause has led interpreters astray, for the Prophet adds, <i>For I will take away from the midst of thee those who exult</i>: but the Prophet&#8217;s design, as I have stated, was different from what they have supposed; for he shows that there was no reason for the Jews to lament and 				deplore the diminution of the Church because the best compensation was offered to them, which was, that by this small number God would be purely served. For when the body of the people was complete, it was, we know, a mass of iniquity. How then could Israel glory in its vast number, since they were all like the giants carrying on war against God? When now God collects a few only, these few would at length acknowledge that they had been preserved in a wonderful manner, in order that religion and 				the true worship of God should not be extinguished in the earth.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p8"></A>We now perceive the Prophet&#8217;s design; but I will endeavor to render this clearer by a comparison: Suppose that in a city licentiousness of life so prevails that the people may seem to be irreclaimable; when it happens that the city itself falls away from its power and pristine state, or is in some other way reformed, not without loss, and is thus led to improve its morals, this would be a compensation to the good, and 				would give courage to the godly and ease their grief, so that they would patiently submit, though the city had not the same abundance, nor the same wealth and enjoyments. How so? because they who remained would form a body of people free from reproach and disgrace. When disease is removed from the human body, the body itself is necessarily weakened; and it is sometimes necessary to amputate a member, that the whole body may be preserved. In this case there is a grievous diminution, but as there 				is no other way of preserving the body, the remedy ought to be patiently sustained. In a similar manner does the Prophet now speak of the city Jerusalem: <i>Thou shalt not be ashamed of the sins by which thou hast transgressed against me</i>. How so? Because they were to be separated from the profane and gross despisers of God; for as long as the good and the evil were mixed together, it was a reproach common to all. Jerusalem was then a den of 				robbers; it was, as it were, a hell on earth; and all were alike exposed to the same infamy, for the pure part could not be distinguished, as a mass of evil prevailed everywhere. The Prophet now says, Thou shalt not be ashamed of thy former infamy. Why? &#8220;Because God will separate the chaff from the wheat, and will gather the wheat; ye shall be, as it were, in the storehouse of God; the chosen seed shall alone remain; there will be such purity, that the glory of the Lord shall shine forth among 				you: ye shall not therefore be ashamed of the disgraceful deeds by which ye are now contaminated.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p9"></A>We now apprehend the meaning of the words. But it may seem strange that the Prophet should say, that sins should be covered by oblivion, which the Jews ought indeed to have thought of often and almost at all times, according to what Ezekiel says,</p>  			 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p10"></A>&#8216;Thou wilt then remember thy ways, and be ashamed,&#8217; <br> 				(<a name="iv.iv.xiv-p10.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#061">Eze 16:61</a><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p10.2"></A>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p11"></A>that is, when God shall be pacified. Ezekiel says, that the fruit of repentance would be, that the faithful, covered with shame, would condemn themselves. Why so? Because the reprobate proceed in their wicked courses, as it were, with closed eyes, and as it has been previously said, they know no shame: though God charges them with their sins, they yet despise and reject every warning with a shameless front; yea, they 				kick against the goads. Since it is so, justly does Ezekiel say, that shame would be the fruit of true repentance, according to what Paul also says in the sixth chapter to the Romans <a name="iv.iv.xiv-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001">Ro 6:1</a><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p11.1"></A>, &#8220;Of which ye are now ashamed.&#8221; He intimates, that when they were sunk in their unbelief, they were so given to shameful deeds, that they perceived not their abomination. They began therefore to 				be ashamed, when they became illuminated. The Prophet seems now to cut off this fruit from repentance: but what he says ought to be otherwise understood, that is, that the Church would be then free from reproach; for the reprobate would be separated, all the filth would be taken away, when God gathered only the remnant for himself; for in this manner, as it has been said, the wheat would be separated from the chaff. <i>Thou shalt not then be ashamed in that day of evil 				deeds; for I will take away from the midst of thee those who exult</i>. He shows how necessary the diminution would be; for all must have perished, had not God cut off the putrid members. How severe soever then and full of pain the remedy would be, it ought yet to be deemed tolerable; for the Church, that is the body, could not otherwise be preserved.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p12"></A>But it may be again objected &#8212; That the Church is cleansed from all spots, inasmuch as the reprobate are taken away; for he says, <i>Thou shalt not be ashamed of the evil deeds by which thou hast sinned</i>, literally, <i>against me</i>, that is, by which thou hast transgressed against me. God here addresses, it may be said, the 				faithful themselves: He then does not speak of the evil deeds of those whom the Lord had rejected. But the answer is easy: When he says, that the Church had sinned, he refers to that mixture, by which no distinction is made between the wheat and the chaff. We may say that a city is impious and wicked, when the majority so much exceeds in number the good, that they do not appear. When therefore among ten thousand men there are only thirty or even a smaller number who are anxious for a better 				state of things, the whole number will be generally counted wicked on account of the larger portion, for the others are hid, and, as it were, covered over and buried. Justly then and correctly does Zephaniah declare, that the Jews had transgressed against God; for in that mixed multitude the elect could not have been distinguished from the reprobate. But he now promises that there would be a distinction, when God took away the proud, who exulted in vain boasting. For he says, <i>I 				will take away from the midst of thee those who exult in thy pride</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p13"></A>Some render the word in the abstract, the exultations of thy pride: but the term <a name="iv.iv.xiv-p13.1"></A>&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501;, found here, is never in construction rendered exultations. It is therefore no doubt to be understood of men. He then names the pride of the people; and yet he addresses the elect, who were afterwards to be gathered. What 				does this mean? even what we have already stated, that before the Church was cleansed from her pollution and filth, there was a common exultation and insolence against God; for these words were everywhere heard &#8212;</p>  			 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p14"></A>&#8220;We are God&#8217;s holy people, <br> 				we are a chosen race, <br> 				we are a royal priesthood, <br> 				we are a holy inheritance.&#8221; <br> 				<a name="iv.iv.xiv-p14.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006">Ex 19:6</a><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p14.5"></A>.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p15"></A>Since, then, these boastings were in the mouth of them all, the Prophet says, that it was the pride of the whole people. <i>I will </i>then <i>take away</i>, he says, <i>from the midst of thee those who exult in thy pride</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">117</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p19"></A>He afterwards adds, <i>Thou shalt no more add to take pride in my holy mountain</i>. Here the Prophet points out the main spring of the evil, because the Jews had hardened themselves in a perverse self-confidence, as they thought that all things were lawful for them, inasmuch as they were God&#8217;s chosen people. Jeremiah also in a similar manner represents their boasting as false, 				when they pretended to be the temple of God. <a name="iv.iv.xiv-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004">Jer 7:4</a><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p19.1"></A>. So our Prophet condemns this pride, because they concealed their sins under the shadow of the temple, and thought it a sufficient defense, that God dwelt on Mount Sion. To show, then, that the people were unhealable, without being cleansed from this pride, the Prophet says, <i>I will take away those who 				exult </i>&#8212; How did they exult? <i>in thy pride</i>: and what was this pride? that they inhabited the holy mount of God, besides which there was no other sanctuary of God on earth. As then they imagined that God was thus bound to them, they insolently despised all admonitions, as though they were exempt from every law and restraint. <i>Thou shalt not 				</i>then <i>add to take pride in my holy mountain</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p20"></A>We now then see how careful we ought to be, lest the favors of God, which ought by their brightness to guide us to heaven, should darken our minds. But as we are extremely prone to arrogance and pride, we ought carefully to seek to conduct ourselves in a meek and humble manner, when favored with God&#8217;s singular benefits; for when we begin falsely to glory in God&#8217;s name, and to put on an empty mask to cover our sins, it is all over with 				us; inasmuch as to our wickedness, to our contempt of God, and to other evil lusts and passions, there is added perverseness, for we persevere in our course, as it were, with an iron and inflexible neck. Thus, indeed, it happens to all hypocrites, who elate themselves through false pretenses as to their connection with God. It follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iv.iv.xv"></A>

<p><a name="iv.iv.xv-p8"></A>Here the Prophet pursues the same subject &#8212; that God would provide for the safety of his Church, by cutting off the majority of the people, and by reserving a few; for his purpose was to gather for himself a pure and holy Church, as the city had previously been full of all uncleanness. It ought, then, to have been a compensation to ease their grief, when the godly saw that God would be propitious to them, though he had 				treated them with great severity. And we must bear in mind what I have before stated &#8212; that the Church could not have been preserved without correcting and subduing that arrogance, which arose from a false profession as to God. Zephaniah takes it now as granted, that pride could not be torn away from their hearts, except they were wholly cast down, and thus made contrite. He then teaches us, that as long as they remained whole, they were ever proud, and that hence it was necessary to apply a 				violent remedy, that they might learn meekness and humility; which he intimates when he says, <i>that the residue of the people would be humble and afflicted</i>; for if they had become willingly teachable, there would have been no need of so severe a correction. In short, though the faithful lament that God should thus almost annihilate his Church, yet in order that they might not murmur, he shows that this was a necessary remedy. How so? because they 				would have always conducted themselves arrogantly against God, had they not been afflicted. It was, therefore, needful for them to be in a manner broken, because they could not be bent. <i>I will</i>, then, he says, <i>make the residue an afflicted and a poor people</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xv-p9"></A>The word, <a name="iv.iv.xv-p9.1"></A>&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;, <i>oni</i>, means humble; but as he adds the word <a name="iv.iv.xv-p9.2"></A>&#1491;&#1500;, <i>dal</i>, he no doubt shows that the Jews could not 				be corrected without being stripped of all the materials of their glorying.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">118</FONT></A>
 				 They were, indeed, extremely wedded to their boastings; yea, they were become hardened in their contempt of God. He therefore says, that this fruit would at last follow, that they would <i>trust in the Lord</i>, that is, when he had laid them prostrate.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xv-p12"></A>This verse contains a most useful instruction: for first we are taught that the Church is subdued by the cross, that she may know her pride, which is so innate and so fixed in the hearts of men, that it cannot be removed, except the Lord, so to speak, roots it out by force. There is then no wonder that the faithful are so much humbled be the Lord, and that the lot of the Church is so contemptible; for if they had more vigor, they would 				soon, as is often the case, break out into an insolent spirit. That the Lord, then, may keep his elect under restraint, he subdues and tames them by poverty. In short, he exercises them under the cross. This is one thing.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xv-p13"></A>We must also notice the latter clause, when he says, <i>They shall trust in the Lord</i>, that is, those who have been reduced to poverty and want. We hence see for what purpose God deprives us of all earthly trust, and takes away from us every ground of glorying; it is, that we may rely only on his favor. This dependence ought not, indeed, to be extorted from us, for what can 				be more desirable than to trust in God? But while men arrogate to themselves more than what is right, and thus put themselves in the place of God, they cannot really and sincerely trust in him. They indeed imagine that they trust in God, when they ascribe to him a part of their salvation; but except this be done wholly, no trust can be placed in God. It is hence necessary that they who ascribe to themselves even the smallest thing, should be reduced to nothing: and this is what the Prophet 				means. Let us further know, that men do not profit under God&#8217;s scourges, except they wholly deny themselves, and forget their own power, which they falsely imagine, and recomb on him alone.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xv-p14"></A>But the Prophet speaks of the elect alone; for we see that many are severely afflicted, and are not softened, nor do they put off their former hardihood. But the Lord so chastises his people, that by the spirit of meekness he corrects in them all pride and haughtiness. But by saying, <i>They shall trust in the name of Jehovah</i>, he sets this trust in contrast with the pride 				which he had previously condemned. They indeed wished to appear to trust in the name of God, when they boasted of Mount Sion, and haughtily brought forward the adoption by which they had been separated from heathen nations; but it was a false boasting, which had no trust in it. To trust, then, in the name of Jehovah is nothing else than sincerely to embrace the favor which he offers in his word, and not to make vain pretenses, but to call on him with a pure heart and with a deep feeling of 				penitence.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xv-p15"></A>For the same purpose he adds, <i>The residue of Israel shall no more work iniquity nor speak falsehood; nor shall there be found a deceitful tongue in their mouth</i>. The Prophet continues the same subject &#8212; that the Church is not to be less esteemed when it consists only of a few men; for in the vast number there was great filth, which not only polluted the earth by its ill 				savor, but infected heaven itself. Since then Jerusalem was full of iniquities, as long as the people remained entire, the Prophet adduces this comfort, that there was no reason for sorrow, if from a vast number as the sand of the sea, and from a great multitude like the stars, God would only collect a small band; for by this means the Church would be cleansed. And it was of great importance that the filth should be cleansed from God&#8217;s sanctuary; for what could have been more disgraceful than 				that the holy place should be made the lodging of swine, and that the place which God designed to be consecrated to himself, should be profaned? As then Jerusalem was the sanctuary of God, ought not true religion to have flourished there? But when it became polluted with every kind of filth, the Prophet shows that it ought not to have seemed grievous that the Lord should take away that vast multitude which falsely boasted that they professed his name. <i>They shall not 				</i>then <i>work iniquity</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xv-p16"></A>Under one kind of expression he includes the whole of a righteous life, when he says, <i>They shall not speak falsely, nor will there be found a deceitful tongue</i>. It is indeed sufficient for the practice of piety or integrity of life to keep the tongue free from frauds and falsehood; but as it cannot be that any one will abstain from all frauds and falsehood, except he 				purely and from the heart fears God, the Prophet, by including the whole under one thing, expresses under the word tongue what embraces complete holiness of life.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xv-p17"></A>It may be now asked, whether this has ever been fulfilled. It is indeed certain, that though few returned to their own country, there were yet many hypocrites among that small number; for as soon as the people reached their own land, every one, as we find, was so bent on his own advantages, that they polluted themselves with heathen connections, that they neglected the building of the temple, and deprived the priests of their tenths, that 				they became cold in the worship of God. With these things they were charged by Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. Since these things were so, what means this promise, that there would be no iniquity when God had cleansed his Church? The Prophet speaks comparatively; for the Lord would so cleanse away the spots from his people that their holiness would then appear more pure. Though then many hypocrites were still mixed with the good and real children of God, it was yet true that iniquity was not so 				prevalent, that frauds and falsehood were not so rampant among the people as they were before.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xv-p18"></A>He afterwards adds, <i>For they shall feed and lie down, and there will be none to terrify them</i>. He mentions another benefit from God &#8212; that he will protect his people from all wrongs when they had repented. We must ever bear in mind what I have stated &#8212; that the Prophet intended here to heal the sorrow of the godly, which night have otherwise wholly dejected their minds. 				That he might then in some measure alleviate the grief of God&#8217;s children, he brings forward this argument &#8212; &#8220;Though few shall remain, it is yet well that the Lord will cleanse away the filth of the holy city, that it may be justly deemed to be God&#8217;s habitation, which was before the den of thieves. It is not then a loss to you, that few will dwell in the holy land, for God will be a faithful guardian of your safety. What need then is there of a large multitude, except to render you safe from 				enemies and from wild beasts? What does it signify, if God receives you under his protection, under the condition that ye shall be secure, though not able to resist your enemies? Though one cannot defend another, yet if God be your protector, and ye be made to live in peace under the defense which he promises, there is no reason why ye should say, that you have suffered a great loss, when your great number was made small. It is then enough for you to live under God&#8217;s guardianship; for though 				the whole world were united against you, and ye had no strength nor defense yourselves, yet the Lord can preserve you; <i>there will be no one to terrify you</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xv-p19"></A>And this argument is taken from the law; for it is mentioned among other blessings, that God would render safe the life of his people; which is an invaluable blessing, and without which the life of men, we know, must be miserable; for nothing is more distressing than constant fear, and nothing is more conducive to happiness than a quiet life: and hence to live in quietness and free from all fear, is what the Lord promises as a chief 				blessing to his people.</p>  <a name="iv.iv.xvi"></A>

<p><a name="iv.iv.xviii-p8"></A>The Prophet confirms what he has been teaching, and encourages the faithful to rejoice, as though he saw with his eyes what he had previously promised. For thus the Prophets, while encouraging the faithful to entertain hope, stimulate them to testify their gratitude, as though God&#8217;s favor was already enjoyed. It is certain, that this instruction was set before the Jews for this purpose, &#8212; that in their exile and extreme distress they 				might yet prepare themselves to give thanks to God, as though they were already, as they say, in possession of what they had prayed for. But we must remember the design of our Prophet, and the common mode of proceeding which all the Prophets followed; for the faithful are exhorted to praise God the same as if they had already enjoyed his blessings, which yet were remote, and seemed concealed from their view.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xviii-p9"></A>We now then perceive what the Prophet meant in encouraging the Jews to praise God: he indeed congratulates them as though they were already enjoying that happiness, which was yet far distant: but as it is a congratulation only, we must also bear in mind, that God deals so bountifully with his Church as to stimulate the faithful to gratitude; for we pollute all his benefits, except we return for them, as it has been stated elsewhere, the 				sacrifice of praise: and as a confirmation of this is the repetition found here, which would have otherwise appeared superfluous. "Exult, daughter of Sion, shout, be glad; rejoice with all thine heart, daughter of Jerusalem.&#8221;  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">119</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xviii-p13"></A>But the Prophet was not thus earnest without reason; for he saw how difficult it was to console the afflicted, especially when God manifested no evidence of hope according to the perception of the flesh; but his purpose was by this heap of words to fortify them, that they might with more alacrity struggle with so many hard and severe trials.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xviii-p14"></A>He then adds, that God had <i>taken away the judgments </i>of Zion. By judgments, he means those punishments which would have been inflicted if it had been the Lord&#8217;s purpose to deal according to strict justice with the Jews, as when any one says in our language, <i>J&#8217;ai brule tous tes proces</i>. He intimates then that God would no 				more make an enquiry as to the sins of his people. The word <a name="iv.iv.xviii-p14.1"></A>&#1502;&#1513;&#1508;&#1496;, <i>meshiphath</i>, we know, has various meanings in Hebrew; but in this place, as I have said, it means what we call in French, <i>Toutes procedures</i>. In short, God declares that the sins of his people are buried, so that he in a 				manner cuts off his character as a judge, and remits his own right, so that he will no more contend with the Jews, or summon them, as they say, to trial. <i>Jehovah</i> then <i>will take away thy judgments</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">120</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xviii-p16"></A>Then follows an explanation, <i>By clearing he has turned aside all enemies</i>;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">121</FONT></A>
 				 for we know that war is one of God&#8217;s judgments. As then God had punished the Jews by the Assyrians, by the Egyptians, by the Chaldeans, and by other heathen nations, he says now, that all enemies would be turned away. It hence follows, that neither the Assyrians nor the Chaldeans had assailed them merely through their own inclination, but that they were, according to what has been elsewhere stated, the swords, as it were, of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xviii-p18"></A>It afterwards follows, <i>The king of Israel is Jehovah in the midst of thee</i>. Here the Prophet briefly shows, that the sum of real and true happiness is then possessed, when God declares, that he undertakes the care of his people. God is said to be in the midst of us, when he testifies that we live under his guardianship and protection. Properly speaking, he never 				forsakes his own; but these forms of speech, we know, are to be referred to the perception of the flesh. When the Lord is said to be afar off, or to dwell in the midst of us, it is to be understood with reference to our ideas: for we think God to be then absent when he gives liberty to our enemies, and we seem to be exposed as a prey to them; but God is said to dwell in the midst of us when he protects us by his power, and turns aside all assaults. Thus, then, our Prophet now says, that God 				will be in the midst of his Church; for he would really and effectually prove that he is the guardian of his elect people. He had been indeed for a time absent, when his people were deprived of all help, according to what Moses expresses when he says, that the people had denuded themselves, because they had renounced God, by whose hand they had been safely protected, and were also to be protected to the end. <a name="iv.iv.xviii-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025">Ex 32:25</a><a name="iv.iv.xviii-p18.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xviii-p19"></A>He lastly adds, <i>Thou shalt not see evil</i>. Some read, &#8220;Thou shalt not fear evil,&#8221; by inserting <a name="iv.iv.xviii-p19.1"></A>&#1497;, <i>iod</i>; but the meaning is the same: for the verb, to see, in Hebrew is, we know, often to be taken in the sense of 				finding or experiencing. <i>Thou shalt </i>then <i>see no evil</i>; that is, God will cause thee to live in quietness, free from every disturbance. If the other reading, Thou shalt not fear evil, be preferred, then the reference is to the blessing promised in the law; for nothing is more desirable than peace and tranquillity. Since then this is the chief of temporal blessings, the Prophet does not without 				reason say, that the Church would be exempt from all fear and anxiety, when God should dwell in the midst of it, according to what he says in <a name="iv.iv.xviii-p19.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001">Ps 46:1</a><a name="iv.iv.xviii-p19.2"></A>. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iv.iv.xix"></A>

<p><a name="iv.iv.xix-p8"></A>The Prophet proceeds still to confirm the same truth, but employs a different mode of speaking. It shall, he says, be then said everywhere to Zion, <i>Fear not, let not thine hands be let down</i>, etc. For these words may no less suitably be applied to the common report or applause of all men, then to the prophetic declaration; so that the expression, It shall be said, may be 				the common congratulation, which all would vie to offer. The import of the whole is, that Jerusalem would be so tranquil that either the Prophets, or all with common consent would say, &#8220;Thou enjoyest thy rest: for God really shows that he cares for thee; there is therefore no cause for thee hereafter to fear.&#8221; For there is expressed here a real change: since the Jews had been before in daily fear, the Prophet intimates, that they would be so safe from every danger, as to be partakers of the 				long-wished-for rest, with the approbation even of the whole world. Hence, it shall be said &#8212; by whom? either by the Prophets, or by common report: it makes no great difference, whether there would be teachers to announce their state joyful and prosperous, or whether all men would, by common consent, applaud God&#8217;s favor, when he had removed from his people all wars, troubles, and fears, so as to make them live in quietness.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xix-p9"></A><i>It shall </i>then <i>be said to Jerusalem, fear not; Sion! let not thine hands be relaxed</i>. By saying Fear not, and let not thine hands be relaxed, he intimates, that all vigor is so relaxed by fear, that no member can perform its function. But by taking a part for the whole, he understands by the word hands, every other part of the body; for by the hands 				men perform their works. Hence in Scripture the hands often signify the works of men. The meaning then is &#8212; that God&#8217;s Church would then be in such a state of quietness as to be able to discharge all its duties and transact its concerns peaceably and orderly. And it is what we also know by experience, that when fear prevails in our hearts we are as it were lifeless, so that we cannot raise even a finger to do anything: but when hope animates us, there is a vigor in the whole body, so that 				alacrity appears everywhere. The Prophet, no doubt, means here, that God thus succors his elect, not that they may indulge in pleasures, as is too often the case, but that they may, on the contrary, strenuously devote themselves to the performance of their duties. We ought therefore to notice the connection between a tranquil state and diligent hands; for, as I have said, God does not free us from all trouble and fear, that we may grow torpid in our pleasures, but that we may, on the contrary, 				be more attentive to our duty. <i>Sion</i>, then! <i>let thine hands be no more torpid </i>&#8212; Why?</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xix-p10"></A><i>Jehovah</i>, he says, <i>in the midst of thee strong, will save</i>. He repeats what he had said, but more fully expresses what might have appeared obscure on account of its brevity. He therefore shows here more at large the benefit of God&#8217;s presence &#8212; that God will not dwell idly in his Church, but will be accompanied with his power. For what end? To save. 				We hence see that the word <a name="iv.iv.xix-p10.1"></A>&#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;, <i>gebur</i>, ascribed to God, is very emphatical; as though he had said, that God would not be idle while residing in the midst of his Church, but would become its evident strength. And it is worthy of notice, that God exhibits not himself as strong that he may terrify his elect, but only that he may become 				their preserver.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xix-p11"></A>He afterwards adds, <i>He will rejoice over thee with gladness</i>. This must be referred to the gratuitous love of God, by which he embraces and cherishes his Church, as a husband his wife whom he most tenderly loves. Such feelings, we know, belong not to God; but this mode of speaking, which often occurs in Scripture, is thus to be understood by us; for as God cannot 				otherwise show his favor towards us and the greatness of his love, he compares himself to a husband, and us to a wife. He means in short &#8212; that God is most highly pleased when he can show himself kind to his Church.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xix-p12"></A>He confirms and shows again the same thing more clearly, <i>He will be at rest </i>(or silent) <i>in his love</i>. The proper meaning of <a name="iv.iv.xix-p12.1"></A>&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;, <i>charesh</i>, is to be silent, but it 				means here to be at rest. The import is, that God will be satisfied, as we say in French, <i>Il prendra tout son contentement</i>; as though he had said that God wished nothing more than sweetly and quietly to cherish his Church. As I have already said, this feeling is indeed ascribed to God with no strict correctness; for we know that he can instantly accomplish whatever it pleases him: but he assumes the character of men; for except he thus speaks 				familiarly with us, he cannot fully show how much he loves us. God then shall be at rest in his love; that is, &#8220;It will be his great delight, it will be the chief pleasure of thy God when he cherishes thee: as when one cherishes a wife most dear to him, so God will then rest in his love.&#8221; <i>He then says, He will exult over thee with joy</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">122</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xix-p17"></A>These hyperbolic terms seem indeed to set forth something inconsistent, for what can be more alien to God&#8217;s glory than to exult like man when influenced by joy arising from love? It seems then that the very nature of God repudiates these modes of speaking, and the Prophet appears as though he had removed God from his celestial throne to the earth. A heathen poet says, &#8212;</p>  			 
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent38"><a name="iv.iv.xix-p18"></A>Not well do agree, nor dwell on the same throne, <br> 				Majesty and love. (Ovid. Met. Lib. 2: 816-7.)</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xix-p19"></A>God indeed represents himself here as a husband, who burns with the greatest love towards his wife; and this does not seem, as we have said, to be suitable to his glory; but whatever tends to this end &#8212; to convince us of God&#8217;s ineffable love towards us, so that we may rest in it, and being weaned as it were from the world, may seek this one thing only, that he may confer on us his favor &#8212; whatever tends to this, doubtless illustrates the 				glory of God, and derogates nothing from his nature. We at the same time see that God, as it were, humbles himself; for if it be asked whether these things are suitable to the nature of God, we must say, that nothing is more alien to it. It may then appear by no means congruous, that God should be described by us as a husband who burns with love to his wife: but we hence more fully learn, as I have already said, how great is God&#8217;s favor towards us, who thus humbles himself for our sake, and in 				a manner transforms himself, while he puts on the character of another. Let every one of us come home also to himself, and acknowledge how deep is the root of unbelief; for God cannot provide for our good and correct this evil, to which we are all subject, without departing as it were from himself, that he might come nigher to us.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xix-p20"></A>And whenever we meet with this mode of speaking, we ought especially to remember, that it is not without reason that God labors so much to persuade us of his love, because we are not only prone by nature to unbelief, but exposed to the deceits of Satan, and are also inconstant and easily drawn away from his word: hence it is that he assumes the character of man. We must, at the same time, observe what I have before stated &#8212; that whatever 				is calculated to set forth the love of God, does not derogate from his glory; for his chief glory is that vast and ineffable goodness by which he has once embraced us, and which he will show us to the end.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xix-p21"></A>What the Prophet says of <i>that day </i>is to be extended to the whole kingdom of Christ. He indeed speaks of the deliverance of the people; but we must ever bear in mind what I have already stated &#8212; that it is not one year, or a few years, which are intended, when the Prophets speak of future redemption; for the time which is now mentioned began when the people were restored 				from the Babylonian captivity, and continues its course to the final advent of Christ. And hence also we learn that these hyperbolic expressions are not extravagant, when the Prophets say, Thou shalt not afterwards fear, nor see evil: for if we regard the dispersion of that people, doubtless no trial, however heavy, can happen to us, which is not moderate, when we compare our lot with the state of the ancient people; for the land of Canaan was then the only pledge of God&#8217;s favor and love. When, 				therefore, the Jews were ejected from their inheritance, it was, as we have said elsewhere, a sort of repudiation; it was the same as if a father were to eject from his house a son, and to repudiate him. Christ was not as yet manifested to the world. The miserable Jews had an evidence, in figures and shadows, of that future favor which was afterwards manifested by the gospel. Since, then, God gave them so small an evidence of his love, how could it be otherwise but that they must have fainted, 				when driven far away from their land? Though the Church is now scattered and torn, and seems little short of being ruined, yet God is ever present with us in his only-begotten Son: we have also the gate of the celestial kingdom fully opened. There is, therefore, administered to us at all times more abundant reasons for joy than formerly to the ancient people, especially when they seemed to have been rejected by God. This is the reason why the Prophet says, that the Church would be lessened by 				calamities, when God again gathered it. But that redemption of the people of Israel ought at this day to be borne in mind by us; for it was a memorable work of God, by which he intended to afford a perpetual testimony that he is the deliverer of all those who hope in him.

<p><a name="iv.iv.xx-p6"></A>He proceeds here with the same subject, but in different words; for except some consolation had been introduced, what the Prophet has hitherto said would have been frigid; for he had promised them joy, he had exhorted the chosen of God to offer praise and thanksgiving; but they were at the same time in a most miserable state. It was hence necessary to add this declaration respecting the exiles being gathered.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xx-p7"></A>But he says <i>at the time</i>. Some read, in respect to time; but this is obscure and strained. Others render it, at the time; but it means strictly from the time; though <a name="iv.iv.xx-p7.1"></A>&#1502;, <i>mem</i>, may sometimes be rendered as a particle of 				comparison. Interpreters do not seem to me rightly to understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning: for I do not doubt but that he points out here the fixed time of deliverance, as though he had said, I will again gather thine afflicted, and those who have endured thy reproach. When? at the time, <a name="iv.iv.xx-p7.2"></A>&#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, <i>memuod</i>; that is, at the determined or fixed 				time: for <a name="iv.iv.xx-p7.3"></A>&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, <i>muod</i>, is not taken in Hebrew for time simply, but for a predetermined time, as we say in French, <i>Un terme prefix</i> <i>I will </i>then <i>gather thine afflicted</i>, but not soon. Our Prophet 				then holds the faithful here somewhat in suspense, that they might continue in their watch tower, and patiently wait for God&#8217;s help; for we know how great is our haste, and how we run headlong when we hope for anything; but this celerity, according to the old proverb, is often delay to us. Since, then, men are always carried away by a certain heat, or by too much impetuosity, to lay hold on what may happen, the Prophet here lays a restraint, and intimates that God has his own seasons to fulfill 				what he has promised, that he will not do so soon, nor according to the will of men, but when the suitable time shall come. And this time is that which he has appointed, not what we desire.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xx-p8"></A>He then adds, <i>Who have sustained reproach for her</i>. In this second clause the Prophet no doubt repeats the same thing; but at the same time he points out, not without reason, their condition &#8212; that the Jews suffered reproach and contumely at the time of their exile, and that on account of being the Church; that is, because they professed to worship their own God; for on 				account of his name the Jews were hated by all nations, inasmuch as their religion was different from the superstitions of all heathens. It could not hence be, but that the unbelieving should vex them with many reproaches, when they were carried away into exile, and scattered in all directions.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">123</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xx-p18"></A>He had said before, I will gather the afflicted; but he now adds, I will gather those who have sustained reproach. I have stated that some read, A burden upon her is reproach; but no sense can be elicited from such words. The Prophet does here no doubt obviate a temptation which awaited God&#8217;s children, who would have to experience in exile what was most grievous to be borne; for they were to be exposed to the taunts and ridicule of all 				nations. Hence he seasonably heals their grief by saying, that though for a time they would be laughed at by the ungodly, they would yet return to their own country; for the Lord had resolved to gather them. But we must ever remember what I have said &#8212; that God would do this in his own time, when he thought it seasonable. It follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iv.iv.xxi"></A>

<p><a name="iv.iv.xxi-p3"></A><b>19.</b> Ecce ego conficiens omnes oppressores tuos (qui te humiliant, ad verbum) in tempore illo; et servabo claudicantem, et reducam expulsam ad faciendum eos in laudem et nomen in terra opprobrii ipsorum.</p>

<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iv.iv.xxi-p5"></A><a name="iv.iv.xxi-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xxi-p6"></A>He confirms here what I have referred to in the last verse that God would overcome all obstacles, when his purpose was to restore his people. On this the Prophet, as we have said, dwells, that the Jews might in their exile sustain themselves with the hope of deliverance. As, then, they could not instantly conceive what was so incredible according to the perceptions of the flesh, he testifies that there is sufficient power in God to subdue 				all enemies.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xxi-p7"></A><i>At that time</i>, he says, he repeats what had been stated before &#8212; that his people must wait as long as God pleases to exercise them under the cross; for if their option had been given to the Jews, they would have willingly continued at their ease; and we know how men are wont to exempt themselves from every trouble, fear, and sorrow. As therefore men naturally desire rest and immunity from all 				evil, the Prophet here exhorts the faithful to patience, and shows, that it cannot be that God will become their deliverer, except they submit to his chastisement; at that time then. It is ever to be observed, that the Prophet condemns that extreme haste which usually takes hold of men when God chastises them. However slowly then and gradually God proceeds in the work of delivering his own, the Prophet shows here, that there was no reason for them to despair, or to be broken down in their 				spirits.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="#fn_123"><FONT SIZE="1">124</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xxi-p9"></A>He then subjoins, that he would <i>save the halting, and restore the driven away</i>. By these words he means, that though the Church would be maimed and torn, there would yet be nothing that could hinder God to restore her: for by the halting and the driven away he understands none other than one so stripped of power as wholly to fail in himself. He therefore compares the 				Church of God to a person, who, with relaxed limbs, is nearly dead. Hence, when we are useless as to any work, what else is our life but a languor like to death? But the Prophet declares here, that the seasonable time would come when God would relieve his own people: though they were to become prostrate and fallen, though they were to be scattered here and there, like a torn body of man, an arm here and a leg there, every limb separated; yet he declares that nothing could possibly prevent God 				to gather his Church and restore it to its full vigor and strength. In short, he means that the restoration of the Church would be a kind of resurrection; for the Lord would humble his people until they became almost lifeless, so as not to be able to breathe: but he would at length gather them, and so gather them that they would not only breathe but be replenished with such new vigor as though they had received no loss. I cannot finish the whole today.</p>  <a name="iv.iv.xxii"></A>  			 
<p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld27"><a name="iv.iv.xxii-p1"></A>Prayer</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xxii-p2"></A>Grant, Almighty God, that as we are at this day so scattered on account of our sins, and even they who seem to be collected in thy name and under thy authority, are yet so torn by mutual discords, that the safety of thy Church hangs as it were on a thread, while in the meantime thine enemies seem with savage cruelty to destroy all those who are thine, and to obliterate thy gospel, &#8212; O grant, that we may live in quietness and resignation, hoping in 				thy promises, so that we may not doubt, but that thou in due time will become our deliverer: and may we so patiently bear to be afflicted and cast down by thee, that we may ever raise up our groans to heaven so as to be heard through the name of thy Son, until being at length freed from every contest, we shall enjoy that blessed rest which is laid up for us in heaven, and which thine only begotten Son has procured for us. Amen.</p>  <a name="iv.iv.xxiii"></A>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref26"><a name="iv.iv.xxiii-p1"></A>Lecture One Hundred and Twenty-eighth</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xxiii-p2"></A>We stopped yesterday at the latter clause of the last verse but one of the Prophet Zephaniah, where God promises that the Jews, who had been before not only obscure, but also exposed to all kinds of reproaches, would again become illustrious; for to give them for a name and for a praise, is no other thing than to render them celebrated, that they might be, as they say, in the mouth of every one.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xxiii-p3"></A>And he says, <i>in the land of their shame</i>, or reproach; for they had been a mockery everywhere; as the unbelieving thought that they deluded themselves with a vain hope, because they boasted that God, under whose protection they lived, would be their perpetual guardian, though they were driven away into exile. Hence an occasion for taunt and ridicule was given. But a 				change for the better is here promised; for all in Assyria and Chaldea would have to see that this was a people chosen by God; so that there would be a remarkable testimony among all nations, that all who trust in God are by no means disappointed, for they find that he is faithful in his promises. The last verse follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iv.iv.xxiv"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="iv.iv.xxiv-p1"></A><a name="iv.iv.xxiv-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#020">Zephaniah 3:20</a><a name="iv.iv.xxiv-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.xxiv-p2"></A><b>20.</b> At that time will I bring you <i>again</i>, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.xxiv-p3"></A><b>20.</b> In tempore illo reducam vos, in tempore illo colligam vos; quia ponam vos in nomen et laudem per cunctos populos terrae, (<i>vel</i>, inter cunctos populos terrae,) quam reducam captivitates vestras in oculis vestris, dicit Jehova.</p>

<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iv.iv.xxiv-p5"></A><a name="iv.iv.xxiv-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xxiv-p6"></A>He repeats the same things, with some change in the words; and not without reason, because no one of then thought that the Jews, who were cast as it were into the grave, would ever come forth again, and especially, that they would be raised unto such dignity and unto so elevated an honor. As then this was not probable, that Prophet confirms his prediction &#8212; <i>I will restore you, says God, I will 				gather you, even because I have given you a name</i>; that is, it is my resolved and fixed purpose to render you celebrated: but here again are laid down the words we have already noticed.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.iv.xxiv-p7"></A>He afterwards adds &#8212; <i>When I shall restore your captivities</i>. The plural number is to be noticed; and not rightly nor prudently is what has been done by many interpreters, who have rendered the word in the singular number; for the Prophet mentions captivities designedly, as the Jews had not only been driven into exile, but had also been scattered through various countries, 				so that they were not one captive people, but many troops of captives. Hence his purpose was to obviate a doubt; for it would not have been enough that one captivity should be restored, except all who had been dispersed were collected into one body by the wonderful power of God. And hence he adds before your eyes, that the Jews might be convinced that they should be eye-witnesses of this miracle, which yet they could hardly conceive, without raising up their thoughts above the world.</p>

The context in Job shows its idea to be that of raising up or swelling; and <i>Parkhurst</i> very properly renders the participle here, swelling, arrogant, insolent; and this notion entirely corresonds with the character given of the city in the next verse; being arrogant, it did &#8220;not hear the voice&#8221; of God.

<p><a name="iv.iv.ii-p14"></A>To &#8220;obey the voice,&#8221; as given in our version and by <i>Newcome</i>, is not quite correct; she was too arrogant even to hear or attend to the voice. &#8220;Correction,&#8221; as in our version, and by <i>Calvin</i>, is rendered &#8220;instruction&#8221; by <i>Newcome</i> and <i>Henderson</i>; for [<a name="iv.iv.ii-p14.1"></A>&#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;] has often this meaning. The <i>Septuagint</i> have &#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#953;&#945;&#957; &#8212; discipline.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.iv.iii-p10"></A> This is the explanation of <i>Grotius</i>, <i>Mede</i>, and <i>Henderson</i>.

What <i>Cocceius</i> proposes is more probable &#8212; &#8220;Who have not gnawed in the morning;&#8221; and on this account they were 					 exceedingly voracious in the evening. But the idea of our common version is very appropriate; it implies that they were like wild beasts prowling all night, and carrying as it were their prey to their dens, that they might devour it there in the morning. This is the view taken by <i>Henry.</i> &#8220;They devour the flesh,&#8221; says Adam <i>Clarke</i>, &#8220;in the night, and gnaw the bones, and extract the marrow 					 afterwards.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

It occurs much oftener as a noun than as a verb, and it commonly means a wrong or injustice done in an outrageous and violent manner. According to this general idea, we may render the phrase here, &#8220;they have outraged the law,&#8221; either by their conduct, or by their comments. It was in either case a wrong done to the law, that was enormous, passing all reason and decency.

There is no assistance from the Septuagint, as the whole text is very different. <i>Marckius</i>, after <i>Drusius</i>, connects it, not with the preceding, but with the following line, in this sense, that how much soever God had punished the city, yet its inhabitants were the more best to 					 corrupt their ways. But the words can hardly admit of this meaning. <i>Henderson</i> supposes [<a name="iv.iv.viii-p23.1"></A>&#1499;] to be understood before [<a name="iv.iv.viii-p23.2"></A>&#1499;&#1500;], and gives this rendering of the two lines &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent04"><a name="iv.iv.viii-p24"></A><i>That her habitation might not be cut off, <br> 					 </i>According <i>to all that I had appointed concerning her.</i></p>  				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.viii-p25"></A><i>Newcome </i>differs as to the last line &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent04"><a name="iv.iv.viii-p26"></A><i>After all </i>the punishment with<i> which I had visited her.</i></p>  				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.viii-p27"></A>None of these are satisfactory. <i>Grotius</i>, taking the sense of the <i>Targum, </i>means to have given the best meaning. He says that [<a name="iv.iv.viii-p27.1"></A>&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;], followed by [<a name="iv.iv.viii-p27.2"></A>&#1506;&#1500;], means sometimes to appoint or constitute, and refers to <a name="iv.iv.viii-p27.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#023">2Ch 36:23</a><a name="iv.iv.viii-p27.3"></A>, &#8220;All the <i>good </i>which I have appointed to her,&#8221; or promised; but he unnecessarily supposes &#8220;shall come&#8221; to be understood; for the word, &#8220;all which,&#8221; may be considered to be in apposition with 					 &#8220;habitation.&#8221; I give the following version of this whole verse &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent04"><a name="iv.iv.viii-p28"></A><i>I said, &#8220;Surely thou wilt fear me, <br> 					 Thou wilt receive instruction;&#8221; <br> 					 Then cut off should not be her habitation </i>&#8212;<i> <br> 					 All that I have committed to her: <br> 					 Yet they rose up early, they corrupted all their doings.</i></p>  				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.viii-p29"></A>To rise up early is a Hebrew phrase, which means a resolved and diligent attention to a thing. The import of the line is, that they with full-bent purpose and activity corrupted all their doings. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.iv.ix-p10"></A> This verse is considered by <i>Newcome</i> and <i>Henderson</i> to be addressed to the godly, to encourage them at the approaching calamities, while <i>Piscator</i>, <i>Grotius</i>, <i>Marckius</i>, and 					 <i>Dathius</i>, agree with <i>Calvin</i> that it is an awful warning to the wicked Jews, spoken of in the preceding verse. Differing somewhat from <i>Calvin</i>, they regard the &#8220;nations&#8221; and &#8220;kingdoms&#8221; to be the Babylonians, who were composed of various nations and kingdoms, and &#8220;upon them&#8221; to be the Jews, and &#8220;the whole land&#8221; to be that of Judea. This view, no 					 doubt, is the most consistent with the context. The objection made by <i>Henderson</i>, that the words <i>expect</i>, or <i>wait for me</i>, are ever used in a good sense, seems to have no force, for these words by themselves can mean neither what is good nor what is bad, the whole depends on the context. The verb [<a name="iv.iv.ix-p10.1"></A>&#1495;&#1499;&#1492;] simply means to tarry, to wait &#8212; &#956;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957;. The word &#8220;therefore&#8221; seems to connect this with the preceding verse, and there is nothing in the foregoing part of the chapter that alludes to the godly. Besides, the words which follow &#8220;wait for me&#8221; explain them, as will be seen by the following literal rendering of the whole verse &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent08"><a name="iv.iv.ix-p11"></A>8.<i> Therefore wait for me, saith Jehovah, <br> 					 For the day of my rising to the prey! <br> 					 For my purpose is to gather nations, <br> 					 To assemble kingdoms, <br> 					 In order to pour on them my indignation, <br> 					 All the heat of my anger; <br> 					 For by the fire of my jealousy <br> 					 Shall be consumed the whole land.</i></p>  				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.ix-p12"></A>The &#8220;fire of God&#8217;s jealousy&#8221; sufficiently proves that what is meant is the land of Judea. (See chapter 1:18.) &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p><a name="iv.iv.x-p10"></A>&#8220;The pure lip&#8221; is evidently not the language which God would adopt in addressing the nations, but the language they would adopt in addressing him. What is meant is a pure heart; what gives utterance to the heart is mentioned for the heart itself; as the &#8220;shoulder&#8221; is afterwards used for the service that is rendered to God.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.x-p11"></A>The verb [<a name="iv.iv.x-p11.1"></A>&#1492;&#1508;&#1498;], to turn, means to change the form, condition, or course of a thing, conveying perhaps here the idea, that the pure lip is substituted for that which is impure: &#8220;I will give them as a change, instead of what they have, a pure lip.&#8221; &#924;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#968;&#969; &#8212; &#8220;I will 					 change,&#8221; Sept. and Sym.; &#963;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#968;&#969; &#8212; &#8220;I will turn,&#8221; Aq. and Theod.

<p><a name="iv.iv.x-p12"></A><i>Newcome</i>, following the conjecture of <i>Houbigant</i>, reads [<a name="iv.iv.x-p12.1"></A>&#1488;&#1513;&#1508;&#1498;], &#8220;I will pour out,&#8221; contrary to all the ancient versions, and without the countenance of a single MS.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.x-p13"></A>Though the word, [<a name="iv.iv.x-p13.1"></A>&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;], peoples, most frequently means the nations, yet there are instances in which it means the people of Israel, inasmuch as they were composed of various tribes. See <a name="iv.iv.x-p13.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#028">1Ki 22:28</a><a name="iv.iv.x-p13.2"></A>; 					 <a name="iv.iv.x-p13.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#006">Joe 2:6</a><a name="iv.iv.x-p13.3"></A>. And if we render the verb, &#8220;restore,&#8221; with <i>Drusius</i> and <i>Grotius</i>, then we must adopt this meaning. Eleven MSS. have &#8220;and,&#8221; [<a name="iv.iv.x-p13.4"></A>&#1493;], before the verb to &#8220;serve:&#8221; and as there is no 					 preposition before &#8220;shoulder,&#8221; we may render the verse &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent04"><a name="iv.iv.x-p14"></A><i>But I will then restore to the people a pure lip, <br> 					 That they may, all of them, call on the name of Jehovah, </i>&#8212;<i> <br> 					 And one shoulder, that they may serve him.</i></p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.iv.x-p21"></A> The expression &#8220;with one shoulder&#8221; is rendered by the Septuagint, &#8220;under one yoke&#8221; &#8212; &#8017;&#960;&#8056; &#950;&#965;&#947;&#8056;&#957; &#7957;&#957;&#945;. The idea is that of oxen drawing together. To serve God under one yoke, is to do the same service unitedly. &#8220;A metaphor,&#8221; says <i>Newcome</i>, &#8220;from the joint efforts of yoked beasts.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.iv.xiii-p9"></A> It is more consonant with the style of the Prophets to render the clauses apart, as <i>Calvin</i> does, than as it is done in our version, and by <i>Newcome</i> and <i>Henderson</i>. The auxiliary verb, as is often the case, is to be understood in the first clause, &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent04"><a name="iv.iv.xiii-p10"></A><i>From beyond the rivers of Cush </i>shall be <i>my suppliants; <br> 					 The daughter of my dispersed shall bring my offering.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p16"></A> This may be rendered, &#8220;Those who exult in thy exaltation:&#8221; the Targum has it, &#8220;in thy glory.&#8221; This &#8220;glory&#8221; or &#8220;exaltation,&#8221; as explained in the next verse, was Mount Sion. There was a preeminence, but it was made an object of unholy boasting. The paraphrase of <i>Henderson</i>, &#8220;thy proud exulters,&#8221; completely leaves out the character of their exultation. The whole verse may be thus rendered, &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p17"></A>In that day thou shalt not be ashamed of thy doings, <br> 					 By which thou hast transgressed against me; <br> 					 For then will I remove from the midst of thee <br> 					 Those who exult in thy exaltation; <br> 					 And thou shalt no more be elevated <br> 					 On account of the mount of my holiness.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.xiv-p18"></A>The word [<a name="iv.iv.xiv-p18.1"></A>&#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;] means exaltation or glory in a good as well as in a bad sense.

What they exulted in was in itself good, but they exulted only in an outward privilege, without connecting it with God, as many have done in all ages. This is the essence of Pharisaism. <i>Vatables</i> and <i>Drusius</i> regard the word as having this sense here. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.iv.xv-p10"></A> The first word, [<a name="iv.iv.xv-p10.1"></A>&#1506;&#1499;&#1497;], means one made humble by distress or affliction, the humbled, rather than the humble. The second word, [<a name="iv.iv.xv-p10.2"></A>&#1491;&#1500;], is one exhausted, or reduced in number, or reduced to poverty. <i>Newcome</i> renders it &#8220;lowly,&#8221; but improperly. <i>Jerome</i> has &#8220;<a name="iv.iv.xv-p10.3"></A>pauperem et egenum &#8212; poor and needy;&#8221; the Septuagint, &#8220;&#960;&#961;&#945;&#965;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#945;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#8212; meek and humble;&#8221; <i>Marckius</i>, &#8220;<a name="iv.iv.xv-p10.4"></A>afflictum et attenuatum &#8212; afflicted and diminished.&#8221; Perhaps the best rendering would be, &#8220;a people humbled and reduced.&#8221; The idea of being &#8220;afflicted&#8221; or distressed, is excluded by what is expressed at the end of the next verse, and also that of being &#8220;poor&#8221; in a worldly respect. The reference seems to be to a humbled state of mind, occasioned by calamities, and to a reduced number &#8212; a remnant.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.xv-p11"></A>&#8220;I will leave&#8221; for [<a name="iv.iv.xv-p11.1"></A>&#1492;&#1513;&#1488;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;], as in our version, is not its full meaning. It means to reserve as a remnant. &#8220;I will cause to remain,&#8221; or, &#8220;I will reserve,&#8221; would be the proper rendering. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p><a name="iv.iv.xviii-p12"></A>The first two lines encourage the fullest expression of feelings, loud crying, and shouting like a trumpet; and then is set forth the character of these feelings; they were to be those of job and exultation. Our version, <i>Newcome </i>and <i>Henderson</i>, render the second line correctly, but not the first; and &#8220;Be glad and rejoice&#8221; are too feeble to express what the third line contains: for the exhortation is to &#8220;rejoice&#8221; and to 					 &#8220;exult.&#8221; It was to be the loud cry of joy, and the shouting of exultation or triumph. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.iv.xix-p13"></A> This is a very remarkable passage. Perhaps the more literal version would be the following, &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent08"><a name="iv.iv.xix-p14"></A>16.<i> In that day he will say to Jerusalem, &#8220;Fear thou not; <br> 					 Sion! relaxed let not thy hands be:</i></p>

<p><a name="iv.iv.xix-p16"></A>The verb [<a name="iv.iv.xix-p16.1"></A>&#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;] is rendered as above by the Septuagint, &#949;&#961;&#949;&#953;, meaning the Lord. The last line but one is according to the Septuagint and the Syriac; and this sense has been adopted by <i>Houbigant</i>, <i>Dathius</i>, and <i>Newcome</i>. There is the difference only of one letter, [<a name="iv.iv.xix-p16.2"></A>&#1491;] for [<a name="iv.iv.xix-p16.3"></A>&#1512;], which are very like. The law of parallelism is in favor of this meaning. The verse contains four lines: there is 					 an evident correspondence of meaning in the second and the last line; and so there is between the first and the third according to the preceding version, but not otherwise. The word rendered &#8220;acclamation&#8221; is a noun from the verb [<a name="iv.iv.xix-p16.4"></A>&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;], to cry aloud, used at the beginning of verse 14. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.iv.xx-p9"></A> This verse presents considerable difficulties, and has been variously rendered. The Septuagint and the Targum differ as much from one another, as they do from the Hebrew. None regard the former as at all suitable; but some, as <i>Grotius</i> and <i>Dathius</i>, take the meaning of the latter, though to reconcile it with the Hebrew is difficult. <i>Marckius</i> seems to have given the most probable meaning &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="iv.iv.xx-p10"></A><a name="iv.iv.xx-p10.1"></A>Remotos a festivitate collegi, <br> 					 Ex to sunt, onus super eam opprobrium.</p>

<p><a name="iv.iv.xx-p12"></A>The word [<a name="iv.iv.xx-p12.1"></A>&#1504;&#1493;&#1490;&#1497;], he derives from [<a name="iv.iv.xx-p12.2"></A>&#1492;&#1490;&#1492;]. In this case it is literally, &#8220;my driven away,&#8221; or, &#8220;my removed&#8221; ones. [<a name="iv.iv.xx-p12.3"></A>&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;] is assembling or meeting, as well as a fixed time or season; and the assembling was that on festal days: it may therefore be rendered, &#8220;festivals.&#8221; &#8220;From thee&#8221; is &#8220;Sion&#8221; in verse 16. Instead of &#8220;on her,&#8221; more than ten copies, as well as the Targum, have &#8220;on thee,&#8221; [<a name="iv.iv.xx-p12.4"></A>&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;]; but an abrupt change of person is of frequent occurrence in the 					 Prophets.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.xx-p13"></A>Following the sense of the Targum, we may, perhaps, give the following version &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="iv.iv.xx-p14"></A>The grieved for the festivals have I gathered from thee; <br> 					 They were a burden on thee, a reproach.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.xx-p15"></A>The paraphrase of the Targum, as given by <i>Dathius</i>, is the following &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="Center"><a name="iv.iv.xx-p16"></A>Those who among thee have impeded the seasons of thy festivity, <br> 					 I will expel from thee; wo to them who have carried arms against thee, and loaded thee with reproaches.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iv.iv.xx-p17"></A>The &#8220;grieved for the festivals&#8221; were those who disliked them, who grudged the offerings that were to be made. The words are in the past tense, but future as to what is said; for the Prophets declare things as exhibited to them in a vision. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.iv.xxi-p8"></A> The first clause in this verse is amended by <i>Newcome</i> and some other in conformity with the Septuagint: but this is a very unsafe process. <i>Henderson&#8217;s </i>version is &#8212;Behold, I will deal with all thine oppressors at that time. &#8220;Deal,&#8221; [<a name="iv.iv.xxi-p8.1"></A>&#1506;&#1513;&#1492;]; &#8220;<a name="iv.iv.xxi-p8.2"></A>interficiam &#8212; I will slay,&#8221; <i>Vulg.</i>; &#8220;<a name="iv.iv.xxi-p8.3"></A>conficiam &#8212; I will make an end,&#8221; <i>Drusius</i>; but to &#8220;deal with,&#8221; or &#8220;act against,&#8221; is the 					 literal rendering.
