<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iii.iii.ii-p5"></A><a name="iii.iii.ii-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p6"></A>We have seen in the first chapter <a name="iii.iii.ii-p6.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#002">Hab 1:2-3</a><a name="iii.iii.ii-p6.1"></A> that the Prophet said in the name of all the faithful. It was indeed a hard struggle, when all things were in a perplexed state and no outlet appeared. The faithful might have thought that all things happened by chance, that there was no divine providence; and even the Prophet uttered complaints of 				this kind. He now begins to recover himself from his perplexities; and he ever speaks in the person of the godly, or of the whole Church. For what is done by some interpreters, who confine what is said to the prophetic office, I do not approve; and it may be easy from the contempt to learn, that the Prophet does not speak according to his private feeling, but that he represents the feelings of all the godly. So then we ought to collect this verse with the complaints, which we have before 				noticed; for the Prophet, finding himself sinking, and as it were overwhelmed in the deepest abyss, raises himself up above the judgement and reason of men, and comes nearer to God, that he might see from on high the things which take place on earth, and not judge according to the understanding of his own flesh, but by the light of the Holy Spirit. For the tower of which he speaks is patience arising from hope. If indeed we would struggle perseveringly to the last, and at length obtain the 				victory over all trials and conflicts, we must rise above the world.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p7"></A>Some understand by <i>tower</i> and <i>citadel</i> the Word of God: and this may in some measure be allowed, though not in every respect suitable. If we more fully weigh the reason for the metaphor, we shall be at no loss to know that the tower is the recess of the mind, where we withdraw ourselves from the world; for we find how 				disposed we are all to entertain distrust. When, therefore, we follow our own inclination, various temptations immediately lay hold on us; nor can we even for a moment exercise hope in God: and many things are also suggested to us, which take away and deprive us of all confidence: we become also involved in variety of thoughts, for when Satan finds men wandering in their imaginations and blending many things together, he so entangles them that they cannot by any means come nigh to God. If then 				we would cherish faith in our hearts, we must rise above all these difficulties and hindrances. And the Prophet by tower means this, that he extricated himself from the thoughts of the flesh; for there would have been no end nor termination to his doubts, had he tried to form a judgement according to his own understanding; <i>I will stand, he says, on my tower,</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A>
 				<i> I and I will set myself on the citadel</i>. In short, the sentence carries this meaning &#8212; that the Prophet renounced the judgement of men, and broke through all those snares by which Satan entangles us and prevents us to rise above the earth.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p11"></A>He then adds, <i>I will watch to see what he may say to me</i>, that is, I will be there vigilant; for by watching he means vigilance and waiting, as though he had said, &#8220;Though no hope should soon appear, I shall not despond; nor shall I forsake my station; but I shall remain constantly in that tower, to which I wish now to ascend: <i>I will watch then 				to see what he may say to me</i>.&#8221; The reference is evidently to God; for the opinion of those is not probable, who apply this &#8220;saying&#8221; to the ministers of Satan. For the Prophet says first, &#8216;I will see what he may say to me,&#8217; and then he adds, &#8216;and what I shall answer.&#8217; They who explain the words &#8216;what he may say,&#8217; as referring to the wicked who might oppose him for the purpose of shaking his faith, overlook the words of the Prophet, for he speaks here in the singular 				number; and as there is no name expressed, the Prophet no doubt meant God. But were the words capable of admitting this explanation, yet the very drift of the argument shows, that the passage has the meaning which I have attached to it. For how could the faithful answer the calumnies by which their faith was assailed, when the profane opprobriously mocked and derided them &#8212; how could they satisfactorily disprove such blasphemies, did they not first attend to what God might say to them? For we 				cannot confute the devil and his ministers, except we be instructed by the word of God. We hence see that the Prophet observes the best order in what he states, when he says in the first place, &#8216;I will see what God may say to me;&#8217; and in the second place, &#8216;I shall then be taught to answer to my chiding;&#8217;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A>
 				 that is, &#8220;If the wicked deride my faith, I shall be able boldly to confute them; for the Lord will suggest to me such things as may enable me to give a full answer.&#8221; We now perceive the simple and real meaning of this verse. It remains for us to accommodate the doctrine to our own use.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p15"></A>It must be first observed, that there is no remedy, when such trials as those mentioned by the Prophet in the first chapter <a name="iii.iii.ii-p15.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#004">Hab 1:4-17</a><a name="iii.iii.ii-p15.1"></A> meet us, except we learn to raise up our minds above the world. For if we contend with Satan, according to our own view of things, he will a hundred times overwhelm us, and we can never be able to resist him. 				Let us therefore know, that here is shown to us the right way of fighting with him, when our minds are agitated with unbelief, when doubts respecting God&#8217;s providence creep in, when things are so confused in this world as to involve us in darkness, so that no light appears: we must bid adieu to our own reason; for all our thoughts are nothing worth, when we seek, according to our own reason, to form a judgement. Until then the faithful ascend to their tower and stand in their citadel, of which 				the Prophet here speaks, their temptations will drive them here and there, and sink them as it were in a bottomless gulf. But that we may more fully understand the meaning, we must know, that there is here an implied contrast between the tower and the citadel, which the Prophet mentions, and a station on earth. As long then as we judge according to our own perceptions, we walk on the earth; and while we do so, many clouds arise, and Satan scatters ashes in our eyes, and wholly darkens our 				judgement, and thus it happens, that we lie down altogether confounded. It is hence wholly necessary, as we have before said, that we should tread our reason under foot, and come nigh to God himself.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p16"></A>We have said, that the tower is the recess of the mind; but how can we ascend to it? even by following the word of the Lord. For we creep on the earth; nay, we find that our flesh ever draws us downward: except then the truth from above becomes to us as it were wings, or a ladder, or a vehicle, we cannot rise up one foot; but, on the contrary, we shall seek refuges on the earth rather than ascend into heaven. But let the word of God 				become our ladder, or our vehicle, or our wings, and, however difficult the ascent may be, we shall yet be able to fly upward, provided God&#8217;s word be allowed to have its own authority. We hence see how unsuitable is the view of those interpreters, who think that the tower and the citadel is the word of God; for it is by God&#8217;s word, as I have already said, that we are raised up to this citadel, that is, to the safeguard of hope; where we may remain safe and secure while looking down from this 				eminence on those things which disturb us and darken all our senses as long as we lie on the earth. This is one thing.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p17"></A>Then the repetition is not without its use; for the Prophet says, <i>On my tower will I stand, on the citadel will I set myself</i>. He does not repeat in other words the same thing, because it is obscure; but in order to remind the faithful, that though they are inclined to sloth, they must yet strive to extricate themselves. And we soon find how slothful we become, except 				each of us stirs up himself. For when any perplexity takes hold on our minds, we soon succumb to despair. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet, after having spoken of the tower, again mentions the citadel.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p18"></A>But when he says, <i>I will watch to see</i>, he refers to perseverance; for it is not enough to open our eyes once, and by one look to observe what happens to us; but it is necessary to continue our attention. This constant attention is, then, what the Prophet means by watching; for we are not so clear-sighted as immediately to comprehend what is useful to be known. And then, 				though we may once see what is necessary, yet a new temptation can obliterate that view. It thus happens, that all our observations become evanescent, except we continue to watch, that is, except we persevere in our attention, so that we may ever return to God, whenever the devil raises new storms, and whenever he darkens the heavens with clouds to prevent us to see God. We hence see how emphatical is what the Prophet says here, I will watch to see. The Prophet evidently compares the faithful 				to watchmen, who, though they hear nothing, yet do not sleep; and if they hear any noise once or twice, they do not immediately sound an alarm, but wait and attend. As, then, they who keep watch ought to remain quiet, that they may not disturb others, and that they may duly perform their office; so it behaves the faithful to be also tranquil and quiet, and wait patiently for God during times of perplexity and confusion.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p19"></A>Let us now inquire what is the purpose of this watching: <i>I will watch to see</i>, he says, <i>what he may say to me</i>. There seems to be an impropriety in the expression; for we do not properly see what is said. But the Prophet connects together here two metaphors. To speak strictly correct, he ought to have said, &#8220;I will 				continue attentive to hear what he may say;&#8221; but he says, <i>I will watch to see what he may say</i>. The metaphor is found correctly used in <a name="iii.iii.ii-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008">Ps 85:8</a><a name="iii.iii.ii-p19.1"></A>,</p>  			 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iii.ii-p20"></A>&#8220;I will hear what God may say; for he will speak peace to his people.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p21"></A>There also it is a metaphor, for the Prophet speaks not of natural hearing: &#8220;I will hear what God may speak,&#8221; what does that hearing mean? It means this, &#8220;I will quietly wait until God shows his favor, which is now hid; for he will speak peace to his people;&#8221; that is, the Lord will never forget his own Church. But the Prophet, as I have said, joins together here two metaphors; for to speak, or to say, means no other thing than that God 				testifies to our hearts, that though the reason for his purpose does not immediately appear to us, yet all things are wisely ruled, and that nothing is better than to submit to his will. But when he says, &#8220;I will see, and I will watch what he may say,&#8221; the metaphor seems incongruous, and yet there appears a reason for it; for the Prophet intended to remind us, that we ought to employ all our senses for this end, &#8212; to be wholly attentive to God&#8217;s word. For though one may be resolved to hear God, 				we yet find that many temptations immediately distract us. It is not then enough to become teachable, and to apply our ears to hear his voice, except also our eyes be connected with them, so that we may be altogether attentive.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p22"></A>We hence see the object of the Prophet; for he meant to express the greatest attention, as though he had said, that the faithful would ever wander in their thoughts, except they carefully concentrated both their eyes and their ears, and all their senses, on God, and continually restrained themselves, lest vagrant speculations or imaginations should lead them astray. And further, the Prophet teaches us, that we ought to have such 				reverence for God&#8217;s word as to deem it sufficient for us to hear his voice. Let this, then, be our understanding, to obey God speaking to us, and reverently to embrace his word, so that he may deliver us from all troubles, and also keep our minds in peace and tranquillity.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p23"></A>God&#8217;s speaking, then, is opposed to all the obstreperous clamours of Satan, which he never ceases to sound in our ears. For as soon as any temptation takes place, Satan suggests many things to us, and those of various kinds: &#8212; &#8220;What will you do? what advice will you take? see whether God is propitious to you from whom you expect help. How can you dare to trust that God will assist you? How can he extricate you? What will be the issue?&#8221; 				As Satan then disturbs us in various ways, the Prophet shows that the word of God alone is sufficient for us all, then, who indulge themselves in their own counsels, deserve to be forsaken by God, and to be left by him to be driven up and down, and here and there, by Satan; for the only unfailing security for the faithful is to acquiesce in God&#8217;s word.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p24"></A>But this appears still more clear from what is expressed at the close of the verse, when the Prophet adds, <i>and what I may answer to the reproof given me</i>; for he shows that he would be furnished with the best weapons to sustain and repel all assaults, provided he patiently attended to God speaking to him, and fully embraced his word: &#8220;Then,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I shall have what I 				may answer to all reproofs, when the Lord shall speak to me&#8221;. By &#8220;reproofs,&#8221; he means not only the blasphemies by which the wicked shake his faith, but also all those turbulent feelings by which Satan secretly labors to subvert his faith. For not only the ungodly deride us and mock at our simplicity, as though we presumptuously and foolishly trusted in God, and were thus over-credulous; but we also reprove ourselves inwardly, and disturb ourselves by various internal contentions; for whatever 				comes to our mind that is in opposition to God&#8217;s word, is properly a chiding or a reproof, as it is the same thing as if one accused himself, as though he had not found God to be faithful. We now, then see that the word &#8220;reproof&#8221; extends farther than to those outward blasphemies by which the unbelieving are wont to assail the children of God; for, as we have already said, though no one attempted to try our faith, yet every one is a tempter to himself; for the devil never ceases to agitate our 				minds. When, therefore, the Prophet says, <i>what I may answer to reproof</i>, he means, that he would be sufficiently fortified against all the assaults of Satan, both secret and external, when he heard what God might say to him.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ii-p25"></A>We may also gather from the whole verse, that we can form no judgement of God&#8217;s providence, except by the light of celestial truth. It is hence no wonder that many fall away under trials, yea, almost the whole world; for few there are who ascend into the citadel of which the Prophet speaks, and who are willing to hear God speaking to them. Hence, presumption and arrogance blind the minds of men, so that they either speak evil of God who 				addresses them, or accuse fortune, or maintain that there is nothing certain: thus they murmur within themselves, and arrogate to themselves more than they ought, and never submit to God&#8217;s word. Let us proceed, -</p>  <a name="iii.iii.iii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="iii.iii.iii-p1"></A><a name="iii.iii.iii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#002">Hab. 2:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003">3</a><a name="iii.iii.iii-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p2"></A><b>2.</b> And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make <i>it</i> plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p3"></A><b>2.</b> Et respondit mihi Jehova et dixit, Scribe visionem, et explana super tabulas, ut currat legens in ea:</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p4"></A><b>3.</b> For the vision <i>is</i> yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</p>

<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p6"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iii.iii.iii-p7"></A><a name="iii.iii.iii-p7.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p8"></A>The Prophet now shows by his own example that there is no fear but that God will give help in time, provided we bring our minds to a state of spiritual tranquillity, and constantly look up to him: for the event which the Prophet relates, proves that there is no danger that God will frustrate their hope and patience, who lift up their minds to heaven, and continue steadily in that attitude. <i>Answer me</i>, he says, <i>did Jehovah, and said</i>. There is no doubt but that the Prophet accommodates here his own example to the common instruction of the whole Church. Hence, by testifying that an answer was given him by God, he intimates that we ought to entertain a cheerful hope, that the Lord, when he finds us stationed in our watch-tower, will in due season convey to us the consolation which he sees we 				need.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p9"></A>But he afterwards comes to the discharge of his prophetic office; for he was bid to write the vision on tables, and to write it in large letters, that it might be read, and that any one, passing by quickly, might be able by one glance to see what was written: and by this second part he shows still more clearly that he treated of a common truth, which belonged to the whole body of the Church; for it was not for his own sake that he was 				bid to write, but for the edification of all.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p10"></A><i>Write</i>, then, <i>the vision</i>, and <i>make it plain</i>; for <a name="iii.iii.iii-p10.1"></A>&#1489;&#1488;&#1512;, <i>bar</i> properly means, to declare plainly.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A>
 				 Unfold it then, he says, <i>on tables, that he may run who reads it</i>; that is, that the writing may not cause the readers to stop. Write it in large characters, that any one, in running by, may see what is written. Then he adds, <i>for the vision shall be for an appointed time</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p12"></A>This is a remarkable passage; for we are taught here that we are not to deal with God in too limited a manner, but room must be given for hope; for the Lord does not immediately execute what he declares by his mouth; but his purpose is to prove our patience, and the obedience of our faith. Hence he says, <i>the vision, is for a time</i>, and a fixed time: for <a name="iii.iii.iii-p12.1"></A>&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, <i>muod</i> means a time which has been determined by agreement. But as it is God who fore appoints the time, the constituted time, of which the Prophet speaks, depends on his will and power. <i>The vision</i>, then, <i>shall be for a time</i>. He reproves here that 				immoderate ardor which takes hold on us, when we are anxious that God should immediately accomplish what he promises. The Prophet then shows that God so speaks as to be at liberty to defer the execution of his promise until it seems good to him.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p13"></A><i>At the end</i>, he says, <i>it will speak</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A>
 				 In a word, the Prophet intimates, that honor is to be given to God&#8217;s word, that we ought to be fully persuaded that God speaks what is true, and be so satisfied with his promises as though what is promised were really possessed by us. <i>At the end</i>, then, <i>it will speak and it will not lie</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A>
 				 Here the Prophet means, that fulfillment would take place, so that experience would at length prove, that God had not spoken in vain, nor for the sake of deceiving; but yet that there was need of patience; for, as it has been said, God intends not to indulge our fervid and importunate desires by an immediate fulfillment, but his design is to hold us in suspense. And this is the true sacrifice of praise, when we restrain ourselves, and remain firm in the persuasion 				that God cannot deceive nor lie, though he may seem for a time to trifle with us. <i>It will not, then, lie</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p16"></A>He afterwards adds, <i>If it will delay, wait for it</i>. He again expresses still more clearly the true character of faith, that it does not break forth immediately into complaints, when God connives at things, when he suffers us to be oppressed by the wicked, when he does not immediately succor us; in a word, when he does not without delay fulfill what he has promised in 				his word. If, then, <i>it delays, wait for it</i>. He again repeats the same thing, <i>coming it will come</i>; that is, however it may be, God, who is not only true, but truth itself, will accomplish his own promises. The fulfillment, then, of the promise will take place in due time.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p17"></A>But we must notice the contrariety, <i>If it will delay, it will come, it will not delay</i>. The two clauses seem to be contrary the one to the other. But delay, mentioned first, has a reference to our haste. It is a common proverb, &#8220;Even quickness is delay to desire.&#8221; We indeed make such haste in all our desires, that the Lord, when he delays one moment, seems to be too 				slow. Thus it may come easily to our mind to expostulate with him on the ground of slowness. God, then, is said on this account to delay in his promises; and his promises also as to their accomplishment may be said to be delayed. But if we have regard to the counsel of God, there is never any delay; for he knows all the points of time, and in slowness itself he always hastens, however this may be not comprehended by the flesh. We now, then, apprehend what the Prophet means.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p24"></A>He is now bidden to <i>write the vision, and to explain it on tables</i>. Many confine this to the coming of Christ; but I rather think that the Prophet ascribes the name of vision to the doctrine or admonition, which he immediately subjoins. It is indeed true, that the faithful under the law could not have cherished hope in God without having their eyes and their minds 				directed to Christ: but it is one thing to take a passage in a restricted sense as applying to Christ himself, and another thing to set forth those promises which refer to the preservation of the Church. As far then as the promises of God in Christ are yea and amen, no vision could have been given to the Fathers, which could have raised their minds, and supported them in the hope of salvation, without Christ having been brought before them. But the Prophet here intimates generally, that a 				command was given to him to supply the hearts of the godly with this support, that they were, as we shall hereafter more clearly see, to wait for God. The vision, then, is nothing else than an admonition, which will be found in the next and the following verses.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p25"></A>He uses two words, to <i>write</i> and to <i>explain</i>; which some pervert rather than rightly distinguish: for as the Prophets were wont to write, and also to set forth the summaries or the heads of their discourses, they think that it was a command to Habakkuk to write, that he might leave on record to posterity what he had said; 				and then to publish what he taught as an edict, that it might be seen by the people passing by, not only for a day or for a few days. But I do not think that the Prophet speaks with so much refinement: I therefore consider that to write and to explain on tables mean the same thing. And what is added, <i>that he may run who reads it</i>, is to be understood as I have already explained it; for God intended to set forth this declaration as memorable and 				worthy of special notice. It was not usual with the Prophets to write in long and large characters; but the Prophet mentions here something peculiar, because the declaration was worthy of being especially observed. What is similar to this is said in <a name="iii.iii.iii-p25.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001">Isa 8:1</a><a name="iii.iii.iii-p25.1"></A>, &#8216;Write on at table with a man&#8217;s pen.&#8217; By a man&#8217;s pen is to be understood common writing, such as is comprehended by the 				rudest and the most ignorant. To the same purpose is what God bids here his servant Habakkuk to do. <i>Write</i>, he says how? Not as Prophecies are wont to be written, for the Prophets set before the people the heads of their discourses; but write, he says, so that he who runs may read, and that though he may be inattentive, he may yet see what is written; for the table itself will plainly show what it contains.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p26"></A>We now see that the Prophet commends, by a peculiar eulogy, what he immediately subjoins. Hence this passage ought to awaken all our powers, as God himself testifies that he announces what is worthy of being remembered: for he speaks not of a common truth; but his purpose was to reveal something great and unusually excellent; as he bids it, as I have already said, to be written in large characters, so that those who run might read 				it.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p27"></A>And by saying that <i>the vision is yet for a time</i>, he shows, as I have briefly explained, what great reverence is due to heavenly truth. For to wish God to conform to our rule is extremely preposterous and unreasonable: and there is no place for faith, if we expect God to fulfill immediately what he promises. It is hence the trial of faith to acquiesce in God&#8217;s word, 				when its accomplishment does in no way appear. As then the Prophet teaches us, that <i>the vision is yet for a time</i>, he reminds us that we have no faith, except we are satisfied with God&#8217;s word alone, and suspend our desires until the seasonable time comes, that which God himself has appointed. <i>The vision</i>, then, <i>yet</i> shall be. But we are inclined to 				reduce, as it were, to nothing the power of God, except he accomplishes what he has said: &#8220;Yet, yet,&#8221; says the Prophet, &#8220;the vision shall be;&#8221; that is, &#8220;Though God does not stretch forth his hand, still let what he has spoken be sufficient for you: let then the vision itself be enough for you; let it be deemed worthy of credit, so that the word of God may on its own account be believed; and let it not be tried according to the common rule; for men charge God with falsehood, except he 				immediately yields to their desires. Let then the vision itself be counted sufficiently solid and firm, until the suitable time shall come.&#8221; And the word <a name="iii.iii.iii-p27.1"></A>&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, <i>muod</i>, ought to be noticed; for the Prophet does not speak simply of time, but, as I have already said, he points out a certain and a preordained time. When men make an 				agreement, they on both sides fix the day: but it would be the highest presumption in us to require that God should appoint the day according to our will. It belongs, then, to him to appoint the times, and so to govern all things, that we may approve of whatever he does.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p28"></A>He afterwards says, <i>And it will speak at the end, and it will not lie</i>. The same is the import of the expression, <i>it will speak at the end</i>; that is, men are very perverse, if they wish God to close his mouth, and if they wish to deny faith to his word, except he instantly fulfill what he speaks. <i>It will</i> then <i>speak</i>; that is, let this liberty of speaking be allowed to God. And there is always an implied contrast between the voice of God and its accomplishment; for we are to acquiesce in God&#8217;s word, though he may conceal his hand: though he may afford no proof of his power, yet the Prophet commands this honor to be given to his word. <i>The vision</i>, then, 				<i>will speak at the end</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.iii-p29"></A>He now expresses more clearly what he had before said of the preordained time; and thus he meets the objections which Satan is wont to suggest to us: &#8220;How long will that time be delayed? Thou indeed namest it as the preordained time; but when will that day come?&#8221; &#8220;The Lord,&#8221; he says, &#8220;will speak at the end;&#8221; that is, &#8220;Though the Lord protracts time, and though day after day we seem to live on vain promises, yet let God speak, that is, 				let him have this honor from you, and be ye persuaded that he is true, that he cannot disappoint you; and in the meantime wait for his power; wait, so that ye may yet remain quiet, resting on his word, and let all your thoughts be confined within this stronghold &#8212; that it is enough that God has spoken. The rest we shall defer until to-morrow.</p>  <a name="iii.iii.iv"></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii.iv-p2"></A>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou sees us laboring under so much weakness, yea, with our minds so blinded that our faith falters at the smallest perplexities, and almost fails altogether, &#8212; O grant that by the power of thy Spirit we may be raised up above this world, and learn more and more to renounce our own counsels, and so to come to thee, that we may stand fixed in our watch tower, ever hoping, through thy power, for whatever thou hast 				promised to us, though thou shouldst not immediately make it manifest to us that thou hast faithfully spoken; and may we thus give full proof of our faith and patience, and proceed in the course of our warfare, until at length we ascend, above all watch towers, into that blessed rest, where we shall no more watch with an attentive mind, but see, face to face, in thine image, whatever can be wished, and whatever is needful for our perfect happiness, through Christ our Lord.

<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref26"><a name="iii.iii.v-p1"></A>Lecture One Hundred and Tenth</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.v-p2"></A>The Prophet taught us yesterday, that we ought to allow God his right of speaking to us, and of sustaining us by his own word, until the ripe time shall come, when he shall really fulfill what he has promised. Then an exhortation follows, added at the close of the verse &#8212; that we are to exercise patience; and the Apostle also, referring to this passage in <a name="iii.iii.v-p2.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038">Heb 10:38</a><a name="iii.iii.v-p2.1"></A>, makes a similar application. He indeed quotes what we shall find in the next verse, &#8216;The just by his faith shall live;&#8217; but he had in view the whole context; and at the same time he reminds us of the Prophet&#8217;s object here in exalting the authority of God&#8217;s word. The exhortation, then, is briefly this &#8212; that though God may keep us in suspense, we yet ought not to cast away hope, for he knows when it is expedient for us that he should stretch forth 				his hand. And as there are two clauses, as I said yesterday, which seem at first sight to be inconsistent the one with the other, the Prophet very fitly joins them together, and considers them to be in perfect harmony; for though God may appear to delay, yet he is not slower than what is necessary and expedient. Let us then be fully persuaded that there is in God prudence and wisdom enough to assist us as soon as it may be needful. The Prophet now reminds us that it is no wonder if God seems to 				us to delay, for we are too hasty in our desires. Let therefore this fervor be restrained, so that we may subject our feelings to the providence and purpose of God. Let us now proceed &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.iii.vi"></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p6"></A>This verse stands connected with the last, for the Prophet means to show that nothing is better than to rely on God&#8217;s word, how much soever may various temptations assault our souls. We hence see that nothing new is said here, hut that the former doctrine is confirmed &#8212; that our salvation is rendered safe and certain through God&#8217;s promise alone, and that therefore we ought not to seek any other haven, where we might securely sustain all 				the onsets of Satan and of the world. But he sets the two clauses the one opposed to the other: every man who would fortify himself would ever be subject to various changes, and never attain a quiet mind; then comes the other clause &#8212; that man cannot otherwise obtain rest than by faith.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p7"></A>But the former part is variously explained. Some interpreters think the word <a name="iii.iii.vi-p7.1"></A>&#1506;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, <i>ophle</i>, to be a noun, and render it elevation, which is not unsuitable; and indeed I hesitate not to regard this as its real meaning, for the Hebrews call a citadel <a name="iii.iii.vi-p7.2"></A>&#1506;&#1493;&#1508;&#1500;, <i>ouphel</i>, rightly deriving it from <a name="iii.iii.vi-p7.3"></A>&#1506;&#1508;&#1500;, <i>ophle</i>, to ascend. What some others maintain, that it signifies to strengthen, is not well founded. Some again give this explanation &#8212; that the 				unbelieving seek a stronghold for themselves, that they may fortify themselves; and this makes but little difference as to the thing itself. But interpreters vary, and differ as to the meaning of the sentence; for some substitute the predicate for the subject, and the subject for the predicate, and elicit this meaning from the Prophet&#8217;s words &#8212; "Every one whose mind is not at ease seeks a fortress, where he may safely rest and strengthens himself;&#8221; and others give this view &#8212; &#8220;He who is proud, 				or who thinks himself well fortified, shall ever be of an unquiet mind.&#8221; And this latter meaning is what I approve, only that I retain the import of the word <a name="iii.iii.vi-p7.4"></A>&#1506;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, <i>ophle</i>, as though it was said &#8212; &#8220;where there is an elation of mind there is no tranquillity.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p8"></A>Let us see first what their view is who give the other explanation. They say that the unbelieving, being obstinate and perverted in their minds, ever seek where they may be in safety, for they are full of suspicions, and having no regard to God they resort to the world for those remedies, by which they may escape evils and dangers. This is their view. But the Prophet, as I have already said, does here, on the contrary, denounce 				punishment on the unbelieving, as though he had said &#8212; &#8220;This reward, which they have deserved, shall be repaid to them &#8212; that they shall always torment themselves.&#8221; The contrast will thus be more obvious; and when we say that God punishes the unbelieving, when he suffers them to be driven here and there, and also harasses their minds with various tormenting thoughts, a more fruitful doctrine is elicited. When therefore the Prophet says that there is no calmness of mind possessed by those who 				deem themselves well fortified, he intimates that they are their own executioners, for they seek for themselves many troubles, many sorrows, many anxieties, and contrive and mingle together many designs and purposes; now they think of one thing, then they turn to another; for the Hebrews say that the soul is made right when we acquiesce in a thing and continue in a tranquil state of mind; but when confused thoughts distract us, then they say that our soul is not right in us. We now perceive the 				real meaning of the Prophet.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p9"></A><i>Behold</i>, he says: by this demonstrative particle he intimates that what he teaches us may be clearly seen if we attend to daily events. The meaning then is, that a proof of this fact exists evidently in the common life of men &#8212; that he who fortifies himself, and is also elated with self confidence, never finds a tranquil haven, for some new suspicion or fear ever disturbs his mind. Hence it comes 				that the soul entangles itself in various cares and anxieties. This is the reward, as I have said, which is allotted by God&#8217;s just judgement to the unbelieving; for God, as he testifies by Isaiah, offers to us rest; and they who reject this invaluable benefit, freely offered to them by God, deserve that they should not only be tormented in one way, but be also harassed by endless agitations, and that they should also vex and torment themselves. It is indeed true that he who is fortified may 				also acquiesce in God&#8217;s word; but the word <a name="iii.iii.vi-p9.1"></A>&#1506;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, <i>ophle</i>, refers to the state of the mind. Whosoever, then, swells with vain confidence, when he finds that he has many auxiliaries according to the flesh, shall ever be agitated, and will at length find that there is nowhere rest, except the mind recumbs on God&#8217;s grace alone. We now 				understand the import of this clause.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p16"></A>It follows, <i>but the just shall live by his faith</i>. The Prophet, I have no doubt, does here place faith in opposition to all those defences by which men so blind themselves as to neglect God, and to seek no aid from him. As men therefore rely on what the earth affords, depending on their fallacious supports, the Prophet here ascribes life to faith. But faith, as it is 				well known, and as we shall presently show more at large, depends on God alone. That we may then live by faith, the Prophet intimates that we must willingly give up all those defences which are wont to disappoint us. He then who finds that he is deprived of all protections, will live by his faith, provided he seeks in God alone what he wants, and leaving the world, fixes his mind on heaven.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p17"></A>As <a name="iii.iii.vi-p17.1"></A>&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1490;&#1514;, <i>amunat</i>, is in Hebrew truth, so some regard it as meaning integrity; as though the Prophet had said, that the just man has more safety in his faithfulness and pure conscience, than there is to the children of this world in all those munitions in which 				they glory. But in this case they frigidly extenuate the Prophet&#8217;s declaration; for they understand not what that righteousness of faith is from which our salvation proceeds. It is indeed certain that the Prophet understands by the word <a name="iii.iii.vi-p17.2"></A>&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1490;&#1514;, <i>amunat</i>, that faith which strips us of all arrogance, and leads us naked and needy to God, that 				we may seek salvation from him alone, which would otherwise be far removed from us.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p18"></A>Now many confine the first part to Nebuchadnezzar, but this is not suitable. The Prophet indeed speaks to the end of the chapter of Babylon and its ruin; but here he makes a distinction between the children of God, who cast all their cares on him, and the unbelieving, who cannot go forth beyond the world, where they seek to be made secure, and gather hence their defences in which they confide. And this is especially worthy of being 				observed, for it helps us much to understand the meaning of the Prophet; if this part &#8212; &#8220;Behold the proud, his soul is not right in him,&#8221; be applied to Nebuchadnezzar, the other part will lose much of its import; but if we consider that the Prophet, as it were, in these two tablets, shows what it is to glory in our own powers or in earthly aids, then what it is to repose on God alone will appear much more clear, and this truth will with more force penetrate into our minds; for we know how much 				such comparisons illustrate a subject which would be otherwise obscure or less evident. For if the Prophet had only declared that our faith is the cause of life and salvation, it might indeed be understood; but as we are disposed to entertain worldly hopes, the former truth would not have been sufficient to correct this evil, and to free our minds from all vain confidence. But when he affirms that all the unbelieving are deceived, while they fortify or elate themselves, be cause God will ever 				confound them, and that though no one disturbs them outwardly, they will yet be their own tormentors, as they have nothing that is right, nothing that is certain; when therefore all this is said to us, it is as though God drew us forcibly to himself, while seeing us deluded by the allurements of Satan, and seeing us too inclined to be taken with deceptions, which would at length lead us to destruction.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p19"></A>We now, then, perceive why Habakkuk has put these two things in opposition the one to the other &#8212; that the defences of this world are not only evanescent, but also bring always with them many tormenting fears &#8212; and then, that the just lives by his faith. And hence also is found a confirmation of what I have already touched upon, that faith is not to be taken here for man&#8217;s integrity, but for that faith which sets man before God emptied 				of all good things, so that he seeks what he needs from his gratuitous goodness: for all the unbelieving try to fortify themselves; and thus they strengthen themselves, thinking that anything in which they trust is sufficient for them. But what does the just do? He brings nothing before God except faith: then he brings nothing of his own, because faith borrows, as it were, through favor, what is not in man&#8217;s possession. He, then, who lives by faith, has no life in himself; but because he wants 				it, he flies for it to God alone. The Prophet also puts the verb in the future tense, in order to show the perpetuity of this life: for the unbelieving glory in a shadowy life; but the Lord will at last discover their folly, and they themselves shall really know that they have been deceived. But as God never disappoints the hope of his people, the Prophet promises here a perpetual life to the faithful.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p20"></A>Let us now come to Paul, who has applied the Prophet&#8217;s testimony for the purpose of teaching us that salvation is not by works, but by the mercy of God alone, and therefore by faith. Paul <i>seems</i> to have misapplied the Prophet&#8217;s words, and to have used them beyond what they import; for the Prophet speaks here of the state of the present life, and he has not previously 				spoken of the celestial life, but exhorted, as we have seen, the faithful to patience, and at the same time testified that God would be their deliverer; and now he adds, <i>the just shall live by faith</i>, though he may be destitute of all help, and though he may be exposed to all the assaults of fortune, and of the wicked, and of the devil. What has this to do, some one may say, with the eternal salvation of the soul? It seems, then, that Paul has 				with too much refinement introduced this testimony into his discussion respecting gratuitous justification by faith. But this principle ought ever to be remembered &#8212; that whatever benefits the Lord confers on the faithful in this life, are intended to confirm them in the hope of the eternal inheritance; for however liberally God may deal with us, our condition would yet be indeed miserable, were our hope confined to this earthly life. As God then would raise up our minds to the hopes of eternal 				salvation whenever he aids us in this world, and declares himself to be our Father; hence, when the Prophet says that the faithful shall live, he certainly does not confine this life to so narrow limits, that God will only defend us for a day or two, or for a few years; but he proceeds much farther, and says, that we shall be made really and truly happy; for though this whole world may perish or be exposed to various changes, yet the faithful shall continue in permanent and real safety. Hence, 				when Habakkuk promises life in future to the faithful, he no doubt overleaps the boundaries of this world, and sets before the faithful a better life than that which they have here, which is accompanied with many sorrows, and proves itself by its shortness to be unworthy of being much desired.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p21"></A>We now perceive that Paul wisely and suitably accommodates to his subject the Prophet&#8217;s words &#8212; that the just lives by faith; for there is no salvation for the soul except through God&#8217;s mercy.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p22"></A>Quoting this place in <a name="iii.iii.vi-p22.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017">Ro 1:17</a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p22.1"></A>, he says that the righteousness of God is in the gospel revealed from faith to faith, and then adds,</p>  			 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iii.vi-p23"></A>&#8220;As it is written, The just shall live by faith.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p24"></A>Paul very rightly connects these things together that righteousness is made known in the Gospel &#8212; and that it comes to us by faith only; for he there contends that men cannot obtain righteousness by the law, or by the works of the law; it follows that it is revealed in the Gospel alone: how does he prove this? By the testimony of the Prophet Habakkuk &#8212;</p>  			 
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iii.vi-p25"></A>&#8220;If by faith the just lives, then he is just by faith; if he is just by faith, then he is not so by the works of the law.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p26"></A>And Paul assumes this principle, to which I have before referred &#8212; that men are emptied of all works, when they produce their faith before God: for as long as man possesses anything of his own, he does not please God by faith alone, but also by his own worthiness.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p27"></A>If then faith alone obtains grace, the law must necessarily be relinquished, as the apostle also explains more clearly in the third chapter of the Epistle to the Galatians <a name="iii.iii.vi-p27.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011">Ga 3:11</a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p27.1"></A>:</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p28"></A>&#8216;That righteousness,&#8217; he says, &#8216;is not by the works of the law, is evident; for it is written, The just shall live by faith, and the law is not of faith.&#8217;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p29"></A>Paul assumes that these, even faith and law, are contrary, the one to the other; contrary as to the work of justifying. The law indeed agrees with the gospel; nay, it contains in itself the gospel. And Paul has solved this question in the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, <a name="iii.iii.vi-p29.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001">Ro 1:1-32</a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p29.1"></A> by saying, that the law cannot assist us to attain 				righteousness, but that it is offered to us in the gospel, and that it receives a testimony from the law and the Prophets. Though then there is a complete concord between the law and the gospel, as God, who is not inconsistent with himself, is the author of both; yet as to justification, the law accords not with the gospel, any more than light with darkness: for the law promises life to those who serve God; and the promise is conditional, dependent on the merits of works. The gospel also does 				indeed promise righteousness under condition; but it has no respect to the merits of works. What then? It is only this, that they who are condemned and lost are to embrace the favor offered to them in Christ.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p30"></A>We now then see how, by the testimony of our Prophet, Paul rightly confirms his own doctrine, that eternal salvation is to be attained by faith only; for we are destitute of all merits by works, and are constrained to stand naked and needy before God; and then the Lord justifies us freely.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p31"></A>But that this may be more evident, let us first consider why men must come altogether naked before God; for were there any worthiness in them, the Lord would by no means deprive them of such an honor. Why then does the Lord justify us freely, except that he may thereby appear just? He has indeed no need of this glory, as though he could not himself be glorified except by doing wrong to men. But we obtain righteousness by faith alone for 				this reason, because God finds nothing in us which he can approve, or what may avail to obtain righteousness. Since it is so, we then see that to be true which the Holy Spirit everywhere declares respecting the character of men. Men indeed glory in a foolish conceit as to their own righteousness: but all philosophic virtues, as they call them, which men think they possess through free-will, are mere fumes; nay, they are the delusions of the devil, by which he bewitches the minds of men, so that 				they come not to God, but, on the contrary, precipitate themselves into the lowest deep, where they seek to exalt themselves beyond measure. However this may be, let us be fully convinced, that in man there is not even a particle either of rectitude or of righteousness; and that whatever men may try to do of themselves, is an abomination before God. This is one thing.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p32"></A>Now after God has stretched forth his hand to his elect, it is still necessary that they should confess their own want and nakedness, as to justification; for though they have been regenerated by the Spirit of God, yet in many things they are deficient, and thus in innumerable ways they become exposed to eternal death in the sight of God; so that they have in themselves no righteousness. The Papists differ from us in the first place, 				imagining as they do, that there are certain preparations necessary; for that false notion about free-will cannot be eradicated from their hearts. As then they will have man to be endued with free- will, they always connect with it some power, as though they could obtain grace by their own doings. They indeed confess that man of himself can do nothing, except by the helping grace of God; but in the meantime they blend, as I have said, their own fictitious preparations. Others confess, that 				until God anticipates us by his grace, there is no power whatever in free-will; but afterwards they suppose that free-will concurs with God&#8217;s grace, as it would be by itself inefficient, except received by our consent. Thus they always reserve for men some worthiness; but a greater difference exists as to the second subject: for after we have been regenerated through God&#8217;s grace, the Papists imagine that we are justified by the merits of works. They confess, that until God anticipates us by his 				grace, we are condemned and cannot attain salvation except through the assisting grace of God; but as soon as God works in us, we are then, they say, able to attain righteousness by our own works.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p33"></A>But we object and say, that the faithful, after having been regenerated by the Spirit of God, do not fulfill the law: they allow this to be true, but say that they might if they would, for that God has commanded nothing which is above what men are capable of doing. And this also is a most pernicious error. They are at the same time forced to confess, that experience itself teaches us that no man is wholly free from sin: then some guilt 				always remains. But they say, that if we kept half the law, we could obtain righteousness by that half. Hence, if one by adultery offended God and thus becomes exposed to eternal death, and yet abstains from theft, he is just, they say, because he is no thief. He is an adulterer, it is true; but he is yet just in part, because he keeps a part of the law; and they call this partial righteousness. But God has not promised salvation to men, except they fully and really fulfill whatever he has 				commanded in his law. For it is not said, &#8220;He that fulfill a part of the law shall live;&#8221; but he who shall do these things shall live in them. Moses does not point out two or three commandments, but includes the whole law (<a name="iii.iii.vi-p33.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005">Le 18:5</a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p33.1"></A>.) There is also a declaration made by James,</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p34"></A>&#8216;He who has forbidden to commit adultery, has also forbidden to steal: whosoever then transgresses the law in one particular, is a transgressor of the whole law&#8217; (<a name="iii.iii.vi-p34.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008">Jas. 2:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#011">11</a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p34.1"></A>):</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p35"></A>he is then excluded from any hope of righteousness. We hence see that the papists are most grossly mistaken, who imagine, that men, when they keep the law only in part, are just.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p36"></A>Were there indeed any one found who strictly kept God&#8217;s law, he could not be counted just, except by virtue of a promise. And here also the Papists stumble, and are at the same time inconsistent with themselves; for they confess that merits do not obtain righteousness for men by their own intrinsic worth, but only by the covenant of the law. But as soon as they have said this, they immediately forget themselves, and say what is 				contrary, like men carried away by passion. Were then the Papists to join together these two things &#8212; that there is no righteousness except by covenant, and that there is a partial righteousness they would see that they are inconsistent: for where is this partial righteousness? If we are not righteous except according to the covenant of the law, then we are not righteous except through a full and perfect observance of the law. This is certain.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p37"></A>They go astray still more grievously as to the remission of sins; for as it is well known, they obtrude their own satisfactions, and thus seek to expiate the sins of men by their own merits, as though the sacrifice of Christ was not sufficient for that purpose. Hence it is that they will not allow that we are gratuitously justified by faith; for they cannot be brought to acknowledge a free remission of sins; and except the remission of 				sins be gratuitous, we must confess that righteousness is not by faith alone, but also by merits. But the whole Scripture proves that expiation is nowhere else to be sought, except through the sacrifice of Christ alone. This error, then, of the Papists is extremely gross and false. They further err in pleading for the merits of works; for they boast of their own inventions, the works of supererogation, or as they call them, satisfactions. And these meritorious works, under the Papacy, are gross 				errors and worthless superstitions, and yet they toil in them and lacerate themselves, nay, they almost wear out themselves. If they mutter many short prayers, if they run to altars and to various churches, if they buy masses, in a word, if they accumulate all these fictitious acts of worship, they think that they merit righteousness before God. Thus they forget their own saying, that righteousness is by covenant; for if it be by covenant, it is certain that God does not promise it to 				fictitious works, which men of themselves invent and contrive. It then follows, that what men bring to God, devised by themselves, cannot do anything towards the attainment of righteousness.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p38"></A>There is also another error which must be noticed, for in good works they perceive not those blemishes which justly displease God, so that our works might be deservedly condemned were they strictly examined and tried. The Papists rightly say, that we are not justified by the intrinsic worthiness of works, but afterwards they do not consider how imperfect our works are, for no work proceeds from mortal man which can fully answer to what 				God&#8217;s covenant requires. How so? For no work proceeds from the perfect love of God, and where the perfect love of God does not exist, there is corruption there. It hence follows, that all our works are polluted before God; for they flow not except from the impure fountain of the heart. Were any to object and say, that the hearts of men are cleansed by the regeneration of the Spirit, we allow this; but at the same time much filth always remains in our hearts, and it ought to be sufficient for us 				to know that nothing is pure and genuine before God except where the perfect love of him exists.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p39"></A>As, then, the Papists are blind to all these things, it is no wonder that they with so much hostility contend with us about righteousness, and can by no means allow that the righteousness of faith is gratuitous, for from the beginning this figment about free- will has been resorted to &#8212; &#8220;if men of themselves come to God, then they are not freely justified.&#8221; They, then, as I have said, imagine a partial righteousness, they suppose the 				deficiency to be made up by satisfactions, they have also, as they say, their devotions, that is, their own contrived modes of worship. Thus it comes, that they ever persuade themselves that the righteousness of man, at least in part, is made up by himself or by works. They indeed allow that we are justified by faith, but when it is added, by faith alone, then they begin to be furious; but they consider not that righteousness, if obtained by faith, cannot be by works, for Paul, as I have shown 				above, reasons from the contrary, when he says, that righteousness, if it be by the works of the law, is not by faith, for faith, as it has been said, strips man of everything, that he may seek of God what he needs. But the Papists, though they think that man has not enough for himself, do not yet acknowledge that he is so needy and miserable, that righteousness must be sought in God alone. But yet sufficiently clear is the doctrine of Paul, and if Paul had never spoken, reason itself is 				sufficient to convince us that men cannot be justified by faith until they cast away every confidence in their own works, for if righteousness be of faith, then it is of grace alone, and if by grace alone, then it cannot be by works. It is wholly puerile in the Papists to think, that it is partly by grace and partly by the merits of works; for as salvation cannot be divided, so righteousness cannot be divided, by which we attain salvation itself. As, then, faith acquires for us favor before 				God, and by this favor we are counted just, so all works must necessarily fall to the ground, when righteousness is ascribed to faith.</p>  <a name="iii.iii.vii"></A>

<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref26"><a name="iii.iii.viii-p1"></A>Lecture One Hundred and Eleventh</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.viii-p2"></A>We yesterday compared this passage of Habakkuk with the interpretation of Paul, who draws this inference, that we are justified by faith without the works of the law, because the Prophet teaches us that we are to live by faith, for the way of life and of righteousness is the same, inasmuch as life is not to be otherwise sought by us than through the paternal favor of God. This then is our life &#8212; to be united to God; but this union with 				God cannot be hoped for by us while he imputes sins to us; for as he is just and cannot deny himself, iniquity must be ever hated by him. Then as long as he regards us as sinners, he must necessarily hold us as hateful to him. Where the hatred of God is, there is death and ruin. It then follows, that we can have no hope of life until we be reconciled to God, and there is no other way by which God can restore us to favor, but by regarding and counting us as just. It hence follows, that Paul 				reasons correctly, when he leads us from life to righteousness; for they are two things which are connected and inseparable.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.viii-p3"></A>Hence the error of the Papists comes to light, who think that to be justified is nothing else but to be renewed in righteousness, in order that we may lead a pious and a holy life. Hence their righteousness is a quality. But Paul&#8217;s view is very different, for he connects our justification and salvation together, inasmuch as God cannot be propitious to us without being reconciled to us. And how is this done even by not imputing to us 				our sins. Hence they speak correctly and truly express what the Holy Spirit everywhere teaches us, who call it imputative righteousness, for they thus show that it is not a quality, but, on the contrary, a relative righteousness, and therefore we said yesterday that he who lives by faith derives life from another, and that every one who is just by faith, is just through what is not in himself, even through the gratuitous mercy of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.viii-p4"></A>We now then see how suitably Paul joins righteousness with life, and adduces the Prophet&#8217;s testimony to prove gratuitous justification, who affirms that we are to live by faith. But it is no wonder that the Papists go in so many ways astray in this instance, for they even differ with us in the meaning of the word faith. Hence it is that they so obstinately deny that we are justified by faith alone. They are forced, as we have said 				yesterday, to admit the righteousness of faith; but the exclusive particle they cannot endure; for they imagine that it is a moulded faith that justifies, and this moulded or formed faith is piety, or the fear of God. And by calling faith unformed they seem to think that we can embrace the promises of God without the fruit of regeneration, which is very absurd, as though faith were not the peculiar gift of the Spirit, and a pledge of our adoption. But these are principles of which the Papists 				are wholly ignorant; for they are given up to a reprobate mind, so that they stumble at the very first elements of religion.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.viii-p5"></A>But it is sufficient for us, in order to understand this passage, to know that we live by faith; for our life is a shadow or a passing cloud; and hence our only remedy is to seek life from God alone. And how does God communicate this life to us? even by gratuitous promises which we embrace by faith; hence salvation is by faith. Now, salvation cannot be ascribed to faith and to works too; for faith refers the praise for life and 				salvation to God alone, and works show that something is due to man. Faith, then, as to justification, entirely excludes all works, so that they come to no account before God; and hence I have said that salvation is by faith; for we are accepted of God by gratuitous remission of sins. The union of God with us is true and real salvation; but no one can be united to God without righteousness, and there is found in us no righteousness; hence God himself freely imputes it to us; and as we are 				justified freely, so our salvation is said to be gratuitous.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.viii-p6"></A>I will not now repeat what may be said of justification by faith; for it is better to proceed with the Prophet&#8217;s subject, only it may be necessary to add two things to what has been said. The Prophet testified to the men of his age that salvation is by faith; it then follows that they had regard to Christ; for without relying on a mediator they could not have trusted in God. For as our righteousness is said to be the remission of sins, 				so a sacrifice must necessarily intervene, by which God is pacified, so as not to impute our sins. They had indeed their sacrifices according to the law; but these were to direct their minds to Christ; for they were by no means acceptable to God, except through that Mediator on whom our faith at this day is founded. There is also another thing: the Prophet, by distinctly expressing that the just live by faith, clearly shows, that through the whole course of this life we cannot be deemed just in 				any other way than by a gratuitous imputation. He does not say that the children of Adam, born in a state exposed to eternal death, do recover life by faith; but that the just, who are now endued with the true fear of God, live by faith; and thus refuted is the romance about initial justification. Let us now then proceed -</p>  <a name="iii.iii.ix"></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii.ix-p6"></A>The Prophet has taught us that a tranquil state of mind cannot be otherwise had than by recumbing on the grace of God alone; and that they who elate themselves, and fly in the air, and feed on the wind, procure for themselves many sorrows and inquietudes. But he now comes to the king of Babylon, and also to his kingdom; for in my judgement he speaks not only of the king, but includes also that tyrannical empire with its people, and 				represents them as a great company of robbers. He then says in short, that though the Babylonians, like drunken men, hurried here and there without any control, yet God&#8217;s vengeance, by which they were to be brought to nothing, was nigh at hand. What ever therefore the Prophet subjoins to the end of the chapter tends to confirm his doctrine, which we have already explained &#8212; that the just shall live by faith. We cannot indeed be fully convinced of this except we hold firmly this principle &#8212; that 				God cares for us, and that the whole world is governed by his providence; so that it cannot be but that he will at length check the wicked, and punish their sins, and deliver the innocent who call upon him. Unless this be our conviction, there can be no benefit derived from our faith; we might indeed be a hundred times deceived; for experience teaches us that the hopes of men, as long as they are fixed on the earth, are vain and delusive, as they are only mere imaginations. Except then God 				governs the world there is no salvation to the faithful; for God in that case would delude them with vain promises, and they would flatter themselves with an empty prospect, or hope for that which is not. Hence the Prophet shows how it is that the just shall live by faith; and that is because the Lord will defend all who call upon him, and that inasmuch as he is the just Judge of all the world, he will finally execute judgement on all the wicked, though for a time they act wantonly, and think 				that they shall escape punishment, because God does not execute upon them immediate vengeance. We now perceive the design of the Prophet.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ix-p7"></A>As to the words, these two particles, <a name="iii.iii.ix-p7.1"></A>&#1488;&#1507; &#1499;&#1497;, <i>aph</i> <i>ki</i>, when joined together, amplify the meaning; and some render them &#8212; "how much more;&#8221; others take them as a simple affirmative, and render them &#8220;truly.&#8221; I approve 				of a middle course, and render them &#8220;yea, truly;&#8221; (<i>Etiam</i> <i>certe</i>;) and they are so taken as I think, in <a name="iii.iii.ix-p7.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001">Ge 3:1</a><a name="iii.iii.ix-p7.2"></A>, Satan thus asked the woman &#8212; yea, truly! <i>Est-ce pour vrai?</i> for the question is that of one doubting, and yet it refers to 				what is certain, &#8212; &#8220;How comes it that God should interdict the eating of the fruit? yea, is it so truly? can it be so? So it is in this place, <i>yea, truly</i>, says the Prophet. That it is an amplification may be gathered from the context. He had said before that they who elevate themselves, or seem to themselves to be well fortified, are fearful in their minds, and driven backwards and forwards. He now advances another step &#8212; that when men are borne 				along by unrestrained wantonness, and promise themselves all things, as though there was no God, they surpass even the drunken, being hurried on by blind cupidity. When therefore men thus abandon themselves, can they escape the judgement of God? Far less bearable is such a madness than that simple arrogance of which he had spoken in the last verse. Thus then are the two verses connected together, &#8212; &#8220;Yea, truly, he who in his pride is like a drunken man, and restrains not himself, and who is 				even like to wild beasts or to the grave, devouring whatever meets them &#8212; he surely will not at length be endured by God.&#8221; Vengeance, then, is nigh to all the proud, who are cruelly furious, passing all bounds and without any fear.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ix-p8"></A>But interpreters differ as to the import of the words which follow. Some render <a name="iii.iii.ix-p8.1"></A>&#1489;&#1493;&#1490;&#1491;, <i>bugad</i>, to deceive, and it means so in some places; and they render the clause thus &#8212; &#8220;Wine deceives a proud man, and he will not dwell.&#8221; This is indeed true, but the meaning is 				strained; I therefore prefer to follow the commonly received interpretation &#8212; that the proud man transgresses as it were through wine. At the same time I do not agree with others as to the expression &#8220;transgressing as through wine.&#8221; Some give this version &#8212; &#8220;Man addicted to wine or to drunkenness transgresses;&#8221; and then they add &#8212; &#8220;a proud man will not inhabit;&#8221; but they pervert the sentence, and mangle the words of the Prophet; for his words are &#8212; <i>By wine transgressing 				the proud man</i>: he does not say that a man addicted to wine transgresses; but he compares the proud to drunken men, who, forgetting all reason and shame, abandon themselves unto all that is disgraceful; for the drunken distinguishes nothing, and becomes like a brute animal, so that he shuns nothing that is base and unbecoming. This is the reason why the Prophet compares proud men to the drunken, who transgress through wine, that is, who observe no moderation, but indulge 				themselves in excesses. We now then understand the real meaning of the Prophet, which many have not perceived.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ix-p21"></A>As to the word <i>inhabiting</i> I take it in a metaphorical sense, as signifying to rest or to continue in the same place. The drunken are borne along by a certain excitement; so they do not restrain themselves, for they have no power over their feet or their hands: but as wine excites them, so they ramble here and there like insane persons. As then such an unruly temper lays hold on and bewilders drunken men, so the Prophet very aptly 				says that the proud man never rests.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ix-p22"></A>And the reason follows, (provided the meaning be approved,) <i>because he enlarges as the grave his soul he is like to death</i>. This is then the insatiableness which he had mentioned &#8212; that the proud cannot be satisfied, and therefore include heaven and earth and sea within the compass of their desires. Since then they thus run here and there, it is no wonder that the 				Prophet says that they do not rest. <i>He enlarges </i>then <i>as the grave his soul</i>; and then he adds &#8212; <i>he heaps together</i>, or congregates, or collects <i>to himself all nations, and accumulates to himself all people</i>; that is, the proud man keeps within no moderate limits; for though he were able to make one 				heap of all nations, he would yet think that not enough, like Alexander, who wept because he had not then enjoyed the empire of the whole world; and had he enjoyed it his tears would not have been dried; for he had heard that, according to the opinion of Democritus, there were many worlds. What did he mean? even this &#8220;Were I to obtain the empire of the world, I should still be poor; for if there are more worlds I should still wish to devour them all.&#8221; These proud men surpass every kind of 				drunkenness.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.ix-p23"></A>We now apprehend the meaning of the words; and though they contain a general truth, yet the Prophet no doubt applies them to the king of Babylon and to all the Chaldeans; for as it has been said, he includes the whole nation. He shows then here, that the Chaldeans were much worse and less excusable than those who with great fierceness elated themselves, for their rage carried them farther, as they wished to swallow up 				the whole world. But in order to express this more fully, he says that they were like drunken men; and he no doubt indirectly derides here the counsels of princes, who think themselves to be very wise, when either by deceit they oppress their neighbors, or by artful means seize for themselves on the lands of others, or by some contrivance, or even by force of arms, take possession of them. As princes take wonderful delight in their iniquities, so the Prophet says that they are like drunken men 				<i>who transgress by wine</i>, that is, who are completely overcome by excessive drinking; and at the same time he shows the cause of this drunkenness by mentioning the words <a name="iii.iii.ix-p23.1"></A>&#1490;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512;, &#8220;proud man.&#8221; As then they are proud, so all their crafts are like the freaks of drunkenness, that is, furious, as when a man is deprived of reason by wine. 				Having thus spoken of the Babylonians he immediately adds &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.iii.x"></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii.x-p6"></A>Now at length the Prophet denounces punishment on the Babylonian king and the Chaldeans; for the Lord would render them a sport to all. But some think that a punishment is also expressed in the preceding verse, such as awaits violent robbers, who devour the whole world. But I, on the contrary, think that the Prophet spoke before of proud cruelty, and simply showed what a destructive evil it is, being an insatiable 				cupidity; and now, as I have stated, he comes to its punishment; and he says first, that all the people who had been collected as it were into a heap, would take up a parable or a taunt, in order to scoff at the king of Babylon. When therefore the Chaldeans should possess the empire of almost the whole world, and subject to their power all their neighboring nations, all these would at length take up against them parables and taunts; and what would be said everywhere would be this &#8212; <i>Woe to him who increases and enriches himself by things not his own. How long?</i> that is, Is this to be perpetual? All then who thus increase themselves heap on themselves thick clay, by which they shall at last be overthrown.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.x-p7"></A>With regard to the words, <a name="iii.iii.x-p7.1"></A>&#1502;&#1513;&#1500;, <i>meshil</i> is a short saying or a pithy sentence, and worthy to be remembered, as we have noticed elsewhere. Some render it parable. As to the word <a name="iii.iii.x-p7.2"></A>&#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1492;, <i>melitse</i>, it probably signifies a scoff or a taunt, by which any one is reproved; for it comes from <a name="iii.iii.x-p7.3"></A>&#1500;&#1493;&#1507;, <i>luts</i>, which means to laugh at one or to deride him. It is indeed true, that the Hebrews call a rhetorician or an interpreter 				<a name="iii.iii.x-p7.4"></A>&#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1507;, <i>melits</i>; and hence some render <a name="iii.iii.x-p7.5"></A>&#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1492;, <i>melitse</i>, interpretation; but it is not suitable to this passage; for the Prophet speaks here of taunts that would be cast against the king 				of Babylon. For as he had as with an open mouth swallowed up all, so also all would eagerly prick him with their goads, and disdainfully deride him. The word he afterwards adds <a name="iii.iii.x-p7.6"></A>&#1495;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, <i>chidut</i>, is to be read, I have no doubt, in the genitive case.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A>
 				 I therefore do not approve of adding a copulative, as many do, and read thus &#8212; &#8220;a taunt and an enigma.&#8221; This word comes from the verb <a name="iii.iii.x-p10.3"></A>&#1495;&#1493;&#1491;, <i>chud</i>, which is to speak enigmatically; hence <a name="iii.iii.x-p10.4"></A>&#1495;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, 				<i>chidut</i>, are enigmas, or metaphors, or obscure sentences; and we know that when we wish to touch a man to the quick, there is more sharpness when we use an obscure word, which contains a metaphor or ambiguity, or something of this kind. It is not therefore without reason that the Prophet calls taunts, enigmas, <a name="iii.iii.x-p10.5"></A>&#1495;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, <i>chidut</i>, that is, obscure words, which bite or prick men sharply, as it were with goads. Hence in all scoffs a figurative language ought to be used; and except the expression be ambiguous or alliterative, or, in short, contain such metaphors as it is not necessary to recite here, there would be in it no beauty, no aptness. When therefore men wish to form biting taunts, they obscure what might be plainly said by some indirect metaphor; and this is the reason 				why the Prophet speaks here of a taunt that is enigmatical, for it is on that account more severe.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.x-p11"></A><i>And he shall say</i>. There is a change of number in this verb, but it does not obscure the sense.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A>
 				 The particle <a name="iii.iii.x-p12.3"></A>&#1492;&#1493;&#1497; may be rendered &#8220;woe&#8221;; or it may be an exclamation, as when one is attracted by some particular sight, <i>caca or sus</i>; and so it is taken often by the Hebrews, and the context seems to favor this meaning, for &#8220;woe&#8221; would be frigid. When the Prophets pronounce a curse on the wicked, it is no 				doubt a dreadful threat; but what is found here is a taunt, by which the whole world would deride those haughty tyrants who thought that they ought to have been worshipped as gods. He! they say, where is he who <i>multiplies himself by what belongs to another?</i> and then, <i>How long </i>is this to be? even <i>such accumulate on themselves thick clay</i>; that is, 				they sink themselves in deep caverns, and heap on themselves mountains, by which they become overwhelmed. We now understand the meaning of the Prophet&#8217;s words.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.x-p13"></A>What seems here to be the singing of triumph before the victory is no matter of wonder; for our faith, as it is well known, depends not on the judgement of the flesh, nor regards what is openly evident; but it is a vision of hidden things, as it is called in <a name="iii.iii.x-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001">Heb 11:1</a><a name="iii.iii.x-p13.1"></A>, and the substance of things not seen. As then the firmness of faith is the same, 				though what it apprehends is remote, and as faith ceases not to see things hidden, &#8212; for through the mirror of God&#8217;s word it ascends above heaven and earth, and penetrates into the spiritual kingdom of God, &#8212; as faith, then, possesses a view so distant, it is not to be wondered that the Prophet here boldly triumphs over the Babylonians, and now prescribes a derisive song for all nations, that the proud, who had previously with so much cruelty exalted themselves, might be scoffed at and 				derided.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.x-p14"></A>But were any to ask, whether it be right to assail even the wicked with scoffs and railleries, the question is unsuitable here; for the Prophet does not here refer to what is lawful for the faithful to do, but speaks only of what is commonly done by men: and we know that it is almost natural to men, that when those whom they had feared and dared not to blame as long as they were in power, are overthrown, they break forth against them not 				only with many complaints and accusations, but also with wanton rudeness. As, then, it usually happens, that all triumph over fallen tyrants, and throw forth their taunts, and all seek in this way to bite, the Prophet describes this regular course of things. It is not, however, to be doubted, but that he composed this song according to the nature of the case, when he says, that they were men who multiplied their own by what belonged to others; that is, that they gathered the wealth of others. 				It is indeed true, that many things are commonly spread abroad, for which there is no reason nor justice; but as some principles of equity and justice remain in the hearts of men, the consent of all nations is as it were the voice of nature, or the testimony of that equity which is engraven on the hearts of men, and which they can never obliterate. Such is the reason for this saying; for Habakkuk, by introducing the people as the speakers, propounded, as it were, the common law of nature, in 				which all agree; and that is, &#8212; that whosoever enriches himself by another&#8217;s wealth, shall at length fall, and that when one accumulates great riches, these will become like a heap to cover and overwhelm him. And if any one of us will consult his own mind, he will find that this is engraven on his very nature.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.x-p15"></A>How, then, does it happen, that many should yet labor to get for themselves the wealth of others, and strive for nothing else through their whole life, but to spoil others that they may enrich themselves? It hence appears that men&#8217;s minds are deprived of reason by sottishness, whenever they thus addict themselves to unjust gain, or when they give themselves loose reins to commit frauds, robberies, and plunders. And thus we perceive that 				the Prophet had not without reason represented all the proud and the cruel as drunken.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.x-p16"></A>Then follow the words, <a name="iii.iii.x-p16.1"></A>&#1506;&#1491;-&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;, <i>od-mati</i>, <i>how long?</i> This also is the dictate of nature; that is, that an end will some time be to unjust plunders, though God may not immediately check plunderers and wicked men, who 				proceed and effect their purposes by force and slaughters, and frauds and evil-doings. In the mean time the Prophet also intimates, that tyrants and their cruelty cannot be endured without great weariness and sorrow; for indignity on account of evil deeds kindles within the breasts of all, so that they become wearied when they see that wicked men are not soon restrained. Hence almost the whole world sound forth these words, How long, how long? When any one disturbs the whole world by his 				ambition and avarice, or everywhere commits plunders, or oppresses miserable nations, &#8212; when he distresses the innocent, all cry out, How long? And this cry, proceeding as it does from the feeling of nature and the dictate of justice, is at length heard by the Lord. For how comes it that all, being touched with weariness, cry out, How long? except that they know that this confusion of order and justice is not to be endured? And this feeling, is it not implanted in us by the Lord? It is then the 				same as though God heard himself, when he hears the cries and greenings of those who cannot bear injustice.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.x-p17"></A>But let us in the meantime see that no one of us should have to say the same thing to himself, which he brings forward against others. For when any avaricious man proceeds through right or wrong, as they say, when an ambitious man, by unfair means, advances himself, we instantly cry, How long? and when any tyrant violently oppresses helpless men, we always say, How long? Though every one says this as to others, yet no one as to himself. 				Let us therefore take heed that, when we reprove injustice in others, we come without delay to ourselves, and be impartial judges. Self love so blinds us, that we seek to absolve ourselves from that fault which we freely condemn in others. In general things men are always more correct in their judgement, that is, in matters in which they themselves are not concerned; but as soon as they come to themselves, they become blind, and all rectitude vanishes, and all judgement is gone. Let us then 				know, that this song is set forth here by the Prophet, drawn, as it were, from the common feeling of nature, in order that every one of us may put a restraint on himself when he discharges the office of a judge in condemning others, and that he may also condemn himself, and restrain his desires, when he finds them advancing beyond just bounds.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.x-p18"></A>We must also observe what he subjoins, &#8212; that the avaricious <i>accumulate on themselves thick clay</i>. This at first may appear incredible; but the subject itself plainly shows what the Prophet teaches here, provided our minds are not so blinded as not to see plain things. Hardly indeed an avaricious man can be found who is not a burden to himself, and to whom his wealth is 				not a source of trouble. Every one who has accumulated much, when he comes to old age, is afraid to use what he has got, being ever solicitous lest he should lose any thing; and then, as he thinks nothing is sufficient, the more he possesses the more grasping he becomes, and frugality is the name given to that sordid, and, so to speak, that servile restraint within which the rich confine themselves. In short, when any one forms a judgement of all the avaricious of this world, and is himself 				free from all avarice, having a free and unblessed mind, he will easily apprehend what the Prophet says here, &#8212; that all the wealth of this world is nothing else but a heap of clay, as when any one puts himself of his own accord under a great heap which he had collected together.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.x-p19"></A>Some refer this to the walls of Babylon, which were built of baked bricks, as it is well known; but this is too farfetched. Others think that the Prophet speaks of the last end of us all; for they who possess the greatest riches, being at last thrown into the grave, are covered with earth: but this also is not suitable here, any more than when they apply it to Nebuchadnezzar, that is, to that sottishness by which he had inebriated 				himself almost through his whole life; or when others apply it to Belshazzar, his grandson, because when he drank from the sacred vessels of the temple, he uttered slanders and blasphemies against God. These explanations are by no means suitable; for the Prophet does not here speak of the person of the king alone, but, as it has been solid, he, on the contrary, summons to judgement the whole nation, which had given itself up to plunders and frauds and other evil deeds.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.x-p20"></A>Then a general truth is to be drawn from this expression that all the avaricious, the more they heap together, the more they lade themselves, and, as it were, bury themselves under a great load. Whence is this? Because riches, acquired by frauds and plunders, are nothing else than a heavy and cumbrous lump of earth: for God returns on the heads of those who thus seek to enrich themselves, whatever they have plundered from others. Had 				they been contented with some moderate portion, they might have lived cheerfully and happily, as we see to be the case with all the godly; who though they possess but little, are yet cheerful, for they live in hope, and know that their supplies are in God&#8217;s hand, and expect everything from his blessing. Hence, then, their cheerfulness, because they have no anxious fears. But they who inebriate themselves with riches, find that they carry a useless burden, under which they lie down, as it were, 				sunk and buried.</p>  <a name="iii.iii.xi"></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii.xiii-p6"></A>The Prophet proceeds with the subject which we have already begun to explain; for he introduces here the common taunts against the king of Babylon and the whole tyrannical empire, by which many nations had been cruelly oppressed. He therefore says that enemies, who should <i>bite him</i>,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A>
 				 would suddenly and unexpectedly <i>rise</i> <i>up</i>. Some expound this of worms, but not rightly: for God not only inflicted punishment on the king when dead, but he intended also that there should be on earth an evident and a memorable proof of his vengeance on the Babylonians, by which it might be made known to all that their cruelty could not be suffered to go 				unpunished.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xiii-p11"></A>The words, <i>Shall not they rise suddenly</i>, are emphatical, both as to the question and as to the word, <a name="iii.iii.xiii-p11.1"></A>&#1508;&#1514;&#1506;, <i>peto</i>, suddenly. We indeed know that interrogations are more common in Hebrew than in Greek and Latin, 				and that they are stronger and more forcible. Our Prophet then speaks of what was indubitable. He adds, <i>suddenly</i>; for the Babylonians, relying on their own power, did not think that any evil was nigh them; and if any one dared to rise up against them, this could not have been so sudden, but they could have in time resisted and driven far away every danger. They indeed ruled far and wide; and we know that the wicked often sleep when they find 				themselves fortified on all sides. But the Prophet declares here that evil was nigh them, which would suddenly overwhelm them. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.iii.xiv"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="iii.iii.xiv-p1"></A><a name="iii.iii.xiv-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#008">Habakkuk 2:8</a><a name="iii.iii.xiv-p1.1"></A></p>

<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iii.iii.xiv-p5"></A><a name="iii.iii.xiv-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xiv-p6"></A>The Prophet here expresses more clearly why the Babylonians were to be so severely dealt with by God. He shows that it would be a just reward that they should be plundered in their turn, who had previously given themselves up to plunder, violence, and cruelty. Since, then, they had exercised so much inhumanity towards all people, the Prophet intimates here that God could not be deemed as treating them cruelly, by inflicting on them so 				severe a punishment: he also confirms the former truth, and recalls the attention of the faithful to the judgement of God, as a main principle to be remembered; for when things in the world are in a state of confusion, we despond, and all hope vanishes, except this comes to our mind &#8212; that as God is the judge of the world it cannot be otherwise but that at length all the wicked must appear before his tribunal, and give there an account of all their deeds; and Scripture, also, is wont to set God 				before us as a judge, whenever the purpose is to allay our troubles. The Prophet now does the same thing: for he says, that robbers should soon come upon the Babylonians, who would plunder them; for God, the judge of the world, would not at last suffer so many plunders to be unpunished.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xiv-p7"></A>But it was everywhere known that the Babylonians had, beyond all bounds and moderation, given themselves up to plunder, so that they spared no nations. Hence he says, <i>because thou hast plundered many nations</i>; and on this he enlarges; because the Babylonians had not only done wrongs to a few men, or to one people, but had marched through many countries. As, then, they 				had taken to themselves so much liberty in doing evil, the Prophet draws this conclusion &#8212; that they could not escape the hand of God, but that they were at length to find by experience that there was a God in heaven, who would repay them for their wrongs.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xiv-p8"></A>He says also, <i>Spoil thee shall the remnant of all people</i>. This admits of two expositions; it may mean, that the people, who had been plundered by the Chaldeans, would take revenge on them: and he calls them a remnant, because they were not entire; but yet he intimates that they would be sufficient to take vengeance on the Babylonians. This view may be admitted, and yet 				we may suppose, that the Prophet takes in other nations, who had never been plundered; as though he had said &#8212; &#8220;Thou hast indeed spoiled many nations; but there are other nations in the world whom thy cruelty could not have reached. All the people then who remain in the world shall strive to outdo one another in attacking thee; and canst thou be strong enough to resist so great a power?&#8221; Either of these views may be admitted; that is, that in the wasted and plundered countries there would be 				still a remnant who would take vengeance, &#8212; or that the world contained other people who would willingly undertake this cause and execute vengeance on the Babylonians; for God would by his secret influence fulfill by their means his purpose of punishing them.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xiv-p9"></A>He then adds, <i>on account of man&#8217;s blood</i>; that is, because thou hast shed innocent blood, and because thou hast committed many plunders; for thou hast not only injured a few men, but thy daringness and cruelty have also extended to many nations. He indeed mentions the <i>earth</i>, and also the <i>city</i>. Some confine these words to the land of Judea and to Jerusalem, but not rightly; for the Prophet speaks here generally; and to the land, he joins cities and their inhabitants.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xiv-p11"></A>But this verse contains a truth which applies to all times. Let us then learn, during the licentious success of tyrants, to raise up our minds to heaven&#8217;s tribunal, and to nourish our patience with this confidence, that the Lord, who is the judge of the world, will recompense these cruel and bloody robbers, and that the more licentious they are, the heavier judgement is nigh them; for the Lord will awaken and raise up as many to 				execute vengeance as there are men in the world, who by shedding blood will inflict punishment, though they may not intend to fulfill his purpose. God can indeed (as it has been often observed) execute his judgements in a wonderful and sudden manner. Let us hence also learn to restrain our evil desires; for none shall go unpunished who will allow themselves to injure their brethren; though they may seem to be unpunished for a time, yet God, who is ever the same, will at length return on their 				heads whatever they have devised against others, as we shall presently see again. He now adds &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.iii.xv"></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii.xv-p6"></A>Habakkuk proceeds in exciting the king of Babylon by taunts; which were not scurrilous jests, but contained serious threatening; for, as it has been already said, the Prophet here introduces indeed the common people, but in that multitude we are to recognize the innumerable heralds of God&#8217;s vengeance: and hence he says, <i>Woe to him who coveteth</i>, etc.; or we may say, He! 				for it is a particle of exclamation, as it has been said: He! thou, he says, who covetest an evil covetousness to thy house, and settest on high thy nest: but what shall happen? The next verse declares the punishment.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xv-p7"></A>The clause, <i>Woe to him who covets an evil covetousness to his house</i>, may be read by itself, &#8212; that this cupidity shall be injurious to his house; as though he had said, &#8220;Thou indeed wouldest provide for thy house by accumulating great riches; but thy house shall find this to be evil and ruinous. So the word <a name="iii.iii.xv-p7.1"></A>&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, <i>roe</i>, evil, might be referred to the house; but the verse is best connected by reading the whole together; that is, that the Babylonians not only provided for themselves, while they with avidity plundered and collected much wealth from all quarters; but that they wished also to make provisions for their sons and grandsons: and we also see, that avarice has this object in view; for they who are 				anxiously bent on the accumulation of riches do not only regard what is needful for themselves to pass through life, but also wish to leave their heirs rich. Since then the avaricious are desirous of enriching for ever their houses, the prophet, deriding this madness, says, <i>Woe to him who covets an evil covetousness to his house</i>; that is, who wishes not only to abound and be satiated himself, but also to supply his posterity with 				abundance.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xv-p8"></A>He adds another vice, which is almost ever connected with the former &#8212; <i>that he may set</i>, he says, <i>his nest on high</i>; for the avaricious have a regard to this &#8212; to fortify themselves; for as an evil conscience is always fearful, many dangers come across their minds &#8212; &#8220;This may happen to me,&#8221; and then, &#8220;My wealth will procure 				for me the hatred and envy of many. If then some danger be at hand, I shall be able to redeem my life many times;&#8221; and he also adds, &#8220;Were I satisfied with a moderate portion, many would become my rivals; but when my treasures surpass what is common, then I shall be as it were beyond the reach of men; and when others envy one another, I shall escape.&#8221; So the avaricious think within themselves when they are ardently bent on accumulating riches, and form for themselves a great heap like a nest; 				for they think that they are raised above the world, and are exempt from the common lot of men, when surrounded by their riches.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xv-p9"></A>We now then see what the Prophet means: <i>Woe</i>, he says, <i>to him who wickedly and intemperately covets</i>. And why does he so do? To enrich his posterity. And then he adds, to him who covets that <i>he may set his nest on high</i>; that is, that he may by wealth fortify himself, that he 				may be able to drive away every danger, and be thus exempt from every evil and trouble. And he adds, <i>that he may deliver himself from the power of evil</i>; he expresses now more clearly what I have said &#8212; that the rich are inebriated with false confidence, when they surpass all others; for they think not themselves to be mortals, but imagine that they have another life, as though they had a world of their own, free from all dangers. But while the 				avaricious thus elevate themselves by a proud confidence, the Prophet derides their madness. He then subjoins their punishment &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.iii.xvi"></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii.xvi-p6"></A>The Prophet again confirms the truth, that those who count themselves happy, imagining that they are like God, busy themselves in vain; for God will turn to shame whatever they think to be their glory, derived from their riches. The avaricious indeed wish, as it appears from the last verse, to prepare splendor for their posterity, and they think to render illustrious their race by their wealth; for this is deemed to be nobility, that 				the richer any one is the more he excels, as he thinks, in dignity, and the more is he to be esteemed by all. Since, then, this is the object of almost all the avaricious, the Prophet here reminds them, that they are greatly deceived; for the Lord will not only frustrate their hopes, but will also convert their glory into shame. Hence he says, that they consult shame to their family.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xvi-p7"></A>He includes in the word <i>consult</i>, all the industry, diligence, skill, care, and labor displayed by the avaricious. We indeed see how very sagacious they are; for if they smell any gain at a distance, they draw it to themselves, night and day they form new designs, that they may circumvent this person and plunder that person, and accumulate into their heap whatever money 				they can find, and also that they may join fields to fields, built great palaces, and secure great revenues. This is the reason why the Prophet says, that they <i>consult shame</i>. What is the object of all their designs? for they are, as we have said, very sharp and keen-sighted, they are also industrious, and torment themselves day and night with continual labor; for what purpose are all these things? even for this, that their posterity may be 				eminent, that their nobility may be in the mouth of all, and spread far and wide. But the Prophet shows that they labor in vail; for God will turn to shame whatever they in their great wisdom contrived for the honor of their families. The more provident then the avaricious are, the more foolish they are, for they consult nothing but disgrace to their posterity.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xvi-p8"></A>He adds, <i>though thou cuttest off many people</i>. This seems to have been expressed for the sake of anticipating an objection; for it might have seemed incredible that the Babylonians should form designs disgraceful to their posterity, when their fame was so eminent, and Babylon itself was like an idol, and the king was everywhere regarded with great reverence and also 				fear. Since then the Babylonians had made such advances, who could have thought it possible that what the Prophet declares here should take place? But, as I have already said, he meets these objections, and says, &#8220;Though the Babylonians shall conquer many enemies, and overthrow strong people, yet this will be of no advantage to them; nay, even that will turn out to their disgrace which they think will be to their glory.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xvi-p9"></A>To the same purpose is what he adds, <i>thou hast sinned against thy soul</i>. Some give this version, &#8220;Thou hast sinned licentiously&#8221; or immoderately; others, &#8220;Thy soul has sinned,&#8221; but these pervert the Prophet&#8217;s meaning; for what he intended was nothing else but the evils which the avaricious and the cruel bring on themselves, and which will return on their own heads. When 				therefore the Babylonians contrived ruin for the whole world, the Prophet predicts that an end, very different from what they thought, would be to them: <i>thou hast sinned</i>, he says, <i>against thine own soul</i>;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A>
 				 that is, the evil which thou didst prepare to bring on others, shall be made by God to fall on thine own head.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xvi-p11"></A>And this kind of declaration ought to be carefully noticed; that is, that the ungodly, while they trouble all, and harass all, while they torment one, plunder another, oppress another, do always sin against their own souls; that is, they do not cause so such loss and sorrow to others as to themselves: for the Lord will make the evil they intend for others to return on themselves. He does not speak here of guilt, but of punishment, when 				he says, &#8220;Thou hast sinned against thy soul;&#8221; that is, thou shalt receive the reward due to all thy sins. We now then see what the Prophet means. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.iii.xvii"></A>

<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iii.iii.xvii-p9"></A><a name="iii.iii.xvii-p9.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xvii-p10"></A>There is here introduced by the Prophet a new personification. He had before prepared a common song, which would be in the mouth of all. He now ascribes speech to stones and wood, of which buildings are formed. <i>The stone, he says, shall cry from the wall, and the wood from the chamber</i>; that is, there is no part of the building that will not cry out that it was built 				by plunder, by cruelty, and, in a word, by evil deeds. The Prophet not only ascribes speech to wood and stone, but he makes them also respond one to the other as in a chorus, as in lyrics there are voices which take up the song in turns. <i>The stone, he says, shall cry from the wall, and the wood shall respond to it from the chamber</i>;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A>
 				 as though he said, &#8220;There will be a striking harmony in every part of the building; for the wall will begin and will utter its song, &#8216;Behold I have been built by blood and by iniquity;&#8217; and the wood will utter the same, and will cry, &#8216;Woe;&#8217; but all in due order; there will be no confused noise, but as music has distinct sounds, so also the stones will respond to the wood and the wood to the stones, so that there may be, as they say, corresponding 				voices.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iii.iii.xvii-p14"></A><a name="iii.iii.xvii-p14.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xvii-p15"></A><i>The stone</i>, then, <i>from the wall shall cry, and the wood shall answer </i>&#8212; what will it answer? &#8212; <i>Woe to him who builds a city by blood</i>, and who adorns <i>his city by iniquity</i>. By blood and by iniquity 				he understands the same thing; for though the avaricious do not kill innocent men, they yet suck their blood, and what else is this but to kill them by degrees, by a slow tormenting process? For it is easier at once to undergo death than to pine away in want, as it happens to helpless men when spoiled and deprived of all their property. Wherever there is wanton plundering, there is murder committed in the sight of God; for as it has been said, he who spares not the helpless, but drinks up their 				blood, doubtless sins no less than if he were to kill them.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xvii-p16"></A>But if this personification seems to any one strange, he must consider how incredible seemed to be what the Prophet here teaches, and how difficult it was to produce a conviction on the subject. We indeed confess that God is the judge of the world; nay, there is no one who does not anticipate his judgement by condemning avarice and cruelty; the very name of avarice is infamous and hated by all: the same may be said of cruelty. But yet 				when we see the avaricious in splendor and in esteem, we are astounded, and no one is able to foresee by faith what the Prophet here declares. Since, then our dullness is so great, or rather our sottishness, it is no wonder that the Prophet should here set before us the stones and the wood, as though he said, &#8220;When all prophecies and all warnings become frigid, and God himself obtains no credit, while openly declaring what he will do, and when his servants consume their labor in vain by warning 				and crying, let now the stones come forth, and be teachers to you who will not give ear to the voice of God himself, and let the wood also cry out in its turn.&#8221; This, then, is the reason why the Prophet introduces here mute things as the speakers, even to awaken our insensibility.</p>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iii.iii.xvii-p17"></A><a name="iii.iii.xvii-p17.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xvii-p18"></A>Then he adds, <i>Shall it not be, behold, from Jehovah of hosts?</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A>
 				 Some give a wrong version, &#8220;Is not this,&#8221; as though <a name="iii.iii.xvii-p23.2"></A>&#1492;&#1504;&#1492;, <i>ene</i>, were put here instead of a pronoun demonstrative; but they extenuate and obscure the beauty of the expression; nay, they pervert the meaning of the Prophet: for when he says, <a name="iii.iii.xvii-p23.3"></A>&#1492;&#1504;&#1492;, <i>ene</i>, behold, he refers not to what he had said, nor specifies any particular thing, and yet he shows, as it were by the finger, the judgement of God, which he bids us to expect; as though he said, &#8220;Shall not God at length have his turn, when the avaricious and the cruel have obtained their triumphs in the world, and darkened the minds and thoughts of all, as though no account were to be given 				by them before the tribunal of God? Shall not God sometime show that it is his time to interpose?&#8221; When, therefore, he says, <i>Shall it not be, behold, from Jehovah?</i> it is an indefinite mode of speaking; he does not say, This or that shall be from the God of hosts; but, <i>Shall it not be, behold, from Jehovah of hosts?</i> that is, God seems now indeed to rest, and on this account men indulge themselves 				with greater boldness; but he will not always remain still, Shall not God then come forth, who seems now to be unconcerned? Something there will at length be from the God of hosts. And the demonstrative particle confirms the same thing: <i>Behold</i>, he says, as though he would show to the faithful as in a picture the tribunal of God, which cannot be seen by us now but by faith. He says, <i>Behold, will not there be 				something</i> from the God of <i>hosts?</i> that is, Will not God at length stretch forth his hand, to show that he is not unconcerned, but that he cares for the affairs of men? In a word, by this mode of speaking is pointed out to us the change, which we are to hole for, inasmuch as it cannot be soon realised.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xvii-p24"></A>Hence he concludes, <i>The people</i>, then, <i>labor in the fire, and the people weary themselves in vain</i>. To labor in the fire means the same thing as to take in hand an unprofitable work, the fruit of which is immediately consumed. Some say that people labor in the fire, because Babylon had been built by a great number of 				men, and at length perished by fire; but this explanation seems far-fetched. I take a simpler view &#8212; that <i>people labor in the fire</i>, like him who performs a work, and a fire is put under it and consumes it; or like him, who with great labor polishes his own work, and a fire is prepared, which destroys it while in the hands of the artifices. For it is certain that the Prophet repeats the same thing in another form, when he says, <a name="iii.iii.xvii-p24.1"></A>&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;-&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;, <i>bedi-rik</i>, with vanity, or for vanity. We now then apprehend his object.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xvii-p25"></A>We may here collect a useful doctrine &#8212; that not only the fruit of labor shall be lost by all who seek by wicked means to enrich themselves, but also that were the whole world favorable and subservient to them, the whole would yet be useless; as it happened to the king of Babylon, though he had many people ready to obey him. But the Prophet derides all those great preparation; for God had fire at hand to consume whatever they had so 				eagerly contrived who wished to spend all their labor to please one man. He at length adds &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.iii.xviii"></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii.xviii-p6"></A>The Prophet briefly teaches us here, that so remarkable would be God&#8217;s judgement on the Babylonians that his name would thereby be celebrated through the whole world. But there is in this verse an implied contrast; for God appeared not in his own glory when the Jews were led away into exile; the temple being demolished and the whole city destroyed; and also when the whole easterly regions was exposed to rapine and 				plunder. When therefore the Babylonians were, after the Assyrians, swallowing up all their neighbors, the glory of God did not then shine, nor was it conspicuous in the world. The Jews themselves had become mute; for their miseries had, as it were, stupefied them; their mouths were at least closed, so that they could not from the heart bless God, while he was so severely afflicting them. And then, in that manifold confusion of all things, the profane thought that all things here take place 				fortuitously, and that there is no divine providence. God then was at that time hid: hence the Prophet says, <i>Filled shall be the earth with the knowledge of </i>God; that is, God will again become known, when by stretching forth his hand he will execute vengeance on the Babylonians; then will the Jews, as well as other nations, acknowledge that the world is governed by God&#8217;s providence, as it had been once created by him.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xviii-p7"></A>We now understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning, and why he says, that the earth would be filled with the knowledge of God&#8217;s glory; for the glory of God previously disappeared from the world, with regard to the perceptions of men; but it shone forth again, when God himself had erected his tribunal by overthrowing Babylon, and thereby proved that there is no power among men which he cannot control. We have the same sentence in 				<a name="iii.iii.xviii-p7.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009">Isa 11:9</a><a name="iii.iii.xviii-p7.1"></A>.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A>
 				The Prophet there speaks indeed of the kingdom of Christ; for when Christ was openly made known to the world, the knowledge of God&#8217;s glory at the same time filled the earth; for God then appeared in his own living image. But yet our Prophet uses a proper language, when he says that the earth shall then be filled with the knowledge of God&#8217;s glory, when he should execute vengeance on the Babylonians. Hence incorrectly have some applied this to the preaching of the gospel, as though 				Habakkuk made a transition from the ruin of Babylon to the general judgement: this is a strained exposition. It is indeed a well-known mode of speaking, and often occurs in the Psalms, that the power, grace, and truth of God are made known through the world, when he delivers his people and restrains the ungodly. The same mode the Prophet now adopts; and he compares this fullness of knowledge to the waters of the sea, because the sea, as we know, is so deep, that there is no measuring of its 				waters. So Habakkuk intimates, that the glory of God would be so much known that it would not only fill the world, but in a manner overflow it: as the waters of the sea by their vast quantity cover the deep, so the glory of God would fill heaven and earth, so as to have no limits. If, at the same time, there be a wish to extend this sentence to the coming of Christ, I do not object: for we know that the grace of redemption flowed in a perpetual stream until Christ appeared in the world. But the 				Prophet, I have no doubt, sets forth here the greatness of God&#8217;s power in the destruction of Babylon.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p8"></A>This passage, in which the Prophet condemns the king of Babylon for his usual practice of rendering drunk his friends, is frigidly interpreted by most expounders. It has been already often said how bold the Jews are in contriving what is fabulous; when nothing certain occurs to them, they divine this or that without any discrimination or shame. Hence they say, that Nebuchadnezzar was given to excess, and led all whom he could into a 				participation of the same vice. They also think that his associates were captive kings, as though he bid them for the sake of sport to be brought to his table, and by drinking to their health, forced them to intoxication, that he might laugh at them when they made themselves base and ridiculous. But all this is groundless; for there is no history that relates any such thing. It is, however, easy to see that another matter is here treated of by the Prophet; for he does not speak of the king 				only, but he refers to the whole empire. I therefore doubt not but that this whole discourse, in which the Babylonian king is condemned for making drunk his associates or friends, is metaphorical or allegorical. But before I proceed further on the subject, I shall say something as to the words; for the meaning of the Prophet will thereby be made more evident.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p9"></A><i>Woe</i>, he says, <i>to him who gives his friend drink</i>; then he adds, <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p9.1"></A>&#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1495; &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1498;, <i>mesephech</i> <i>chemetak</i>, "who joinest and bottle.&#8221; <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p9.2"></A>&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, <i>cheme</i>, is taken in Hebrew for a bottle; and we know, and it is sufficiently evident from Scripture, that the Jews used bottles of skin, as there are casks and larger vessels with us. Since, then, they put their wine into bottles, these were often taken for their cups, as it is in our language, when one says, <i>Des flacons, 				des bouteilles</i>. Hence some give this explanation &#8212; that the king of Babylon brought forth his flagons, that he might force to intoxication, by excessive drinking, those who could not and dared not to resist his will. But others render <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p9.3"></A>&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, <i>cheme</i>, wrath, with a preposition understood: and in order that nothing 				may be understood, some render the participle, <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p9.4"></A>&#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1495;, &#8220;displaying,&#8221; that is, &#8220;his fury.&#8221; But as <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p9.5"></A>&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, <i>cheme</i>, means to be hot, we may, therefore, properly give this version, &#8220;Uniting thy heat;&#8221; that is, &#8220;It is not enough for thee 				to inebriate others, except thou implicates them with thyself.&#8221; We now perceive the meaning of this phrase. He adds, <i>And thou also dost inebriate</i>. We may hence learn that the Prophet had no other thing in view, but to show that the king of Babylon sought for himself many associates in his intemperance or excess: at the same time he takes, as I have said, excess in a metaphorical sense. I shall presently explain more fully what all this means; 				but now we only expound the words. <i>And thou</i>, he says, <i>dost also inebriate</i>: the particle <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p9.6"></A>&#1488;&#1507;, as it is well known, is laid down for the sake of amplifying. After having said, <i>Thou unitest thy heat</i>; that is, thou exhales thine intemperance, 				so that others also contract the same heat with thyself, he immediately adds, <i>Thou inebriatest them</i>. It follows, <i>that their nakedness may be made open</i>; that is, that they may disclose themselves with shame. The following verse I shall defer until we shall see more clearly what the Prophet had in view.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_40"><FONT SIZE="1">41</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p16"></A>As I have already said the Prophet charges the Babylonian king with having implicated neighboring kings in his own evil desires, and with having in a manner inebriated them. He indeed compares the insatiable avarice of that king to intemperance; for as it is the object of drunken men not to drink what may suffice them, but to glut themselves with wine, so also when avarice is dominant in the hearts of men, they are seized with a 				certain kind of fury, like a person who has an immoderate love for wine. This is the reason for the metaphor; for the Babylonian king, when he thirsted for the blood of men, and also for wealth and kingdoms, led into the same kind of madness many other kings; for he could not have succeeded except he had allured the favor of many others, and deceived them with vain expectations. As a person who gives himself up to drinking wishes to leave associates, so Habakkuk lays the same thing to the 				charge of the king of Babylon; for being himself addicted to insatiable avarice, he procured associates to be as it were his guests, and quaffed wine to them, that is, elicited their cupidity, that they might join him in his wars; for each hoped for a part of the spoil after victory. Since, then, he had thus blinded many kings, they are said to have been inebriated by him. We indeed know that such allurements infatuate the minds and hearts of men; for there is no intoxication that stultifies 				men more than that eager appetite by which they devour both lands and seas.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p17"></A>We now then apprehend what the Prophet meant &#8212; that the Babylonian king not only burnt with his own avarice, but kindled also, as it were, a flame in others, like drunken men who excite one another. As then he had thus inflamed all the neighboring kings to rush headlong without any consideration and without any shame, like a person suffocated and overcome by excessive drinking; so the Prophet designates this inflaming as quaffing wine 				to them.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p18"></A>And this metaphor ought to be carefully observed; for we see at this day as in a mirror what the Prophet teaches here. For all the great princes, when they devise any plans of their own, send their ambassadors here and there, and seek to involve with themselves other cities and princes; and as no one is willing to endanger himself without reason, they set forth many fallacious allurements. And when any city fears a neighboring prince, 				it will seek to fortify itself by a new protection; so a treaty, when offered, becomes like a snare to it. And then when any inferior prince wishes to enlarge his borders, or to revenge himself, he willingly puts on arms, nay, anxiously, that he may be able, by the help of a greater, to effect his purpose, which he could not otherwise accomplish. Thus we see that dukes and counts, as they are called, and free cities, are daily inebriated. They who are chief kings, abounding in wine, that is, 				full of many vain promises, give to drink, as it were with full flagons, bidding wine to be brought forth on a well furnished table &#8212; &#8220;I will make thine enemy to give way to thee, and thou shalt compel him according to thy wish, and when I shall obtain the victory a part of the spoil shall be allotted to thee; I desire nothing but the glory. With regard to you, the free cities, see, ye tremble continually; now if you lie under my shadow, it will be the best security for you.&#8221; Such quaffing is 				to be found at this day almost throughout the whole of Europe.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p19"></A>Then the Prophet does not without reason commemorate this vice in the king of Babylon &#8212; that he made those associates drunk whom he had bound to himself by perfidious treaties; for as it has been said, there is no intoxication so dangerous as this madness; that is, when any one promises this or that to himself, and imagines what does not exist. Hence he not only says, that the Babylonian king gave drink to his 				friends, but also that he <i>joined his bottles</i>; as though he had said that he was very liberal, nay, prodigal, while seeking associates in his intemperance; for if one condition did not suffice, another was added &#8212; &#8220;Behold, my king is prepared; but if he is not enough another will be joined with him.&#8221; They thus then join together their heat. If we take <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p19.1"></A>&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, <i>cheme</i>, for a bottle, then to join together their bottles would mean, that they accumulated promises until they inebriated those whom they sought to deceive. But if the other interpretation be more approved, which I am disposed to follow, then the meaning would be &#8212; <i>They join together their own heat</i>, that is, they implicate others with 				themselves; as they burn themselves with insatiable cupidity, so they spread this ardor far and wide, so that the desires of many become united.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p20"></A>He afterwards adds &#8212; <i>that thou mayest see their nakedness</i>. It was not indeed an object to the king of Babylon to disclose the reproach of all those whom he had induced to take part in his wars; but we know that great kings are wont to neglect their friends, to whom at first they promise every thing. When a king wishes to entice to himself a free city or an inferior 				prince, he will say &#8212; &#8220;See, I seek nothing but to be thy friend&#8221;. We indeed see how shamefully they perjure themselves; nor is it enough for them to utter these perjuries in their courts; but not many years pass away before our great kings make public their abominable perjuries; and it appears immediately afterwards that they thus seek, without any shame, to mock both God and all mankind. After testifying that they seek nothing except to defend by their protection what is right and just, and to 				resist the tyranny and pride of others, they immediately draw back when anything adverse afterwards happens, and the city, which had hoped everything from so liberal a king, is afterwards forced to submit and to agree with its enemies, and to manage matters anyhow; thus its <i>nakedness is disclosed</i>. In the same manner also are inferior princes deprived of their power. And to whom is this to be imputed but to the principal author? For when any one, 				for the sake of ambition or avarice, leads others to inconvenience or to damage, he may justly and correctly be said to disclose their nakedness. We now apprehend the Prophet&#8217;s real meaning, which interpreters have not understood. I come now to the next verse &#8212;</p>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p21"></A><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p21.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p22"></A>He says that he is <i>satiated with shame instead of glory</i>. Some give this rendering &#8212; &#8220;Thou art satiated with shame more than glory;&#8221; but this does not suit the passage; for the Prophet does not mean that the Babylonian king was satiated with his own reproach, but rather with that of others. Secondly, the particle <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p22.1"></A>&#1502;, <i>mem</i>, is not put here in a comparative sense, but the clause is on the contrary to be understood thus &#8212; &#8220;By thy glory, or, on account of thy glory, thou art satiated with shame&#8221;. It must also in the third place be observed, that punishment is not what the Prophet describes in these words; for it immediately follows &#8212; <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p22.2"></A>&#1513;&#1514;&#1492; &#1490;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1492;, <i>shite gam ate</i>, &#8220;drink thou also.&#8221; He comes now to punishment. By saying, then, that the king of Babylon was satiated with shame on account of glory, it is the same as though he had said, that while he was intent on increasing his own glory he brought all others to shame. It is indeed the common game of great kings, as it has been said, to enlarge their own 				power at the expense and loss of others. They would, indeed, if they could, render their friends safe; but when any one loses ground in their favor they neglect him. We see how at this day great kings, raising great armies, shed innocent blood. When a slaughter is made in war they express their grief, but it is only on account of their own glory or advantage. They will in words profess that they sympathise with the miserable men who faithfully spent their life for them, but they have for them 				no real concern. As, then, great kings draw human blood, and care nothing when many perish for their sake, the Prophet justly says, That the king of Babylon was satiated with shame on account of glory; that is, that while he was seeking his own glory he was satiated with the reproaches of many; for many perished on his account, many had been robbed of their power, or were afterwards to be robbed &#8212; for the Prophet refers not here to what had taken place, but he speaks of things future; and the 				past tense of verbs was intended to express certainty; and we know that this was a common mode of speaking with the Prophets.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p28"></A>He now adds &#8212; <i>drink thou also</i>. We hence see that the king of Babylon was secure as long as he remained untouched, though his alliance and friendship had proved ruinous to many. As long then as his kingdom flourished, the king of Babylon cared but little for the losses of others. Hence the Prophet says &#8212; &#8220;Thou shalt also drink; thou thinkest that others only shall be 				punished, as though thou were not exposed to God&#8217;s judgement; but thou shalt come in thy turn and drink;&#8221; &#8212; in what way? He speaks here allegorically of the vengeance which was nigh the king of Babylon &#8212; &#8220;Thou, also,&#8221; he says, &#8220;shalt drink and become a reproach,&#8221; or, shalt be uncovered.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p29"></A>The word <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p29.1"></A>&#1506;&#1512;&#1500;, <i>orel</i>, means in Hebrew the foreskin; and the foreskinned, or uncircumcised, was the name given to the profane and the base, or the contaminated; and hence many give this rendering &#8212; &#8220;Thou also shalt become ignominious;&#8221; but others express more 				clearly the Prophet&#8217;s meaning by this version &#8212; &#8220;Thou shalt be uncovered.&#8221; Yet their opinion is not amiss who think that there is here a change of letters, that <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p29.2"></A>&#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1500;, <i>eorel</i>,is put for <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p29.3"></A>&#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1500;, <i>erol</i>; and <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p29.4"></A>&#1512;&#1506;&#1500;, <i>rol</i>, means to be cast asleep; and it well suits a drunken man to say that he is stupefied. But as the Prophet had spoken of nakedness, I retain the word as it is; and thus the two clauses will correspond &#8212; <i>Then thou shalt drink and be uncovered</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p30"></A>Then follows the explanation &#8212; <i>Poured forth</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">43</FONT></A>
 				<i> into thee shall be the cup of Jehovah&#8217;s right hand</i>; that is, &#8220;the Lord shall in his time be thy cup-bearer; as thou hast inebriated many nations, and under the pretense of friendship hast defrauded those who, being bound to thee by treaties, have been ruined; so the Lord will now recompense thee with the reward which thou hast deserved: As thou hast been a cup-bearer to others, so the Lord will now become thy cup-bearer, and will inebriate 				thee, but after another manner.&#8221; We indeed know what the Scripture everywhere means by the cup of God&#8217;s hand &#8212; even vengeance of every kind. God strikes some with giddiness and precipitates them, when deprived of all humanity, into a state of madness; others he infatuates by insensibility; some he deprives of all understanding, so that they perceive nothing aright; against others he rouses up enemies, who treat them with cruelty. Hence the Lord is said to extend his cup to the wicked whenever 				he takes vengeance on them.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p32"></A>Therefore he adds &#8212; <i>the reproach of spewing shall be on thy glory</i>. The word <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p32.1"></A>&#1511;&#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;, <i>kikolun</i>, is a compound.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">44</FONT></A>
 				 We have already seen that <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p33.6"></A>&#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1499;, <i>kolun</i>, is shame; and now he speaks of shameful spewing. And this may be referred to the king of Babylon &#8212; that he himself would shamefully spew out what he had before intemperately swallowed down; or it might be fitly applied to his enemies &#8212; that they would spew in the 				face of the king of Babylon.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p34"></A>The end of which Habakkuk speaks, awaits all tyrants, who disturb the world by their cupidity. Ambition does indeed so infatuate them, that they neither spare human blood, nor hesitate to endanger their nearest and most friendly associates. Since then an insatiable thirst for glory thus inflames them, the Prophet justly allots to them this reward &#8212; that they shall receive filthy and shameful spewing instead of that glory, in seeking 				which they observed no limits. Let us now proceed -</p>  <a name="iii.iii.xxii"></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii.xxii-p6"></A>We may hence easily learn, that the Prophet has not been speaking of drunkenness, but that his discourse, as we have explained, was metaphorical; for here follows a reason, why he had denounced such a punishment on the king of Babylon, and that was, because he had exercised violence, not only against all nations indiscriminately, but also against the chosen people of God. He had before only set forth in general the cruelty with which 				the king of Babylon had destroyed many nations; but he now speaks distinctly of the Jews, in order to show that God would in a peculiar manner be the avenger of that cruelty which the Chaldeans had employed towards the Jews, because the Lord had taken that people under his own protection. Since then the king of Babylon had assailed the children of God, who had been adopted by him, and whose defender he was, he denounces upon him here a special punishment. We thus see that this discourse is 				properly addressed to the Jews; for he intended to bring them some consolation in their extreme evils, so that they might strengthen their patience; for they were thereby made to see that the wrongs done to them were come to a reckoning before God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxii-p7"></A>By <i>Libanus</i> then we are to understand either Judea or the temple; for Libanus, as it is well known, was not far from the temple; and it is elsewhere found in the same sense. But if any extends this to the land of Judea, the meaning will be the same; there will be but little or no difference as to the subject that is handled. <i>Because the 				violence</i> then <i>of Libanus shall overwhelm thee</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxii-p8"></A>Then come the words, <i>the pillaging of beasts</i>. Interpreters think that the Chaldeans and Assyrians are here called <a name="iii.iii.xxii-p8.1"></A>&#1489;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <i>bemutt</i>, beasts, as they had been savage and cruel, like wild beasts, in laying waste 				Judea; but I rather understand by the beasts of Libanus those which inhabited that forest. The Prophet exaggerates the cruelty of the king of Babylon by this consideration, that he had been an enemy to brute beasts; and I consider the pronoun relative <a name="iii.iii.xxii-p8.2"></A>&#1488;&#1513;&#1512;, <i>asher</i>, which, to be understood before the verb <a name="iii.iii.xxii-p8.3"></A>&#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;, <i>ichiten</i>, which may be taken to mean, to tear, or to frighten, Some give this rendering, &#8220;The plundering of beasts shall tear them;&#8221; as though he had said, &#8220;The Babylonians are indeed like savage beasts, but they shall be torn by their own plundering:&#8221; but another sense will be more suitable that the plundering of beasts, which terrified them, shall 				overwhelm thee; for the same verb, <a name="iii.iii.xxii-p8.4"></A>&#1497;&#1489;&#1505;, <i>icas</i>, shall cover or overwhelm the king of Babylon, is to be repeated here. He adds at last the clause, which was explained yesterday. We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet to be &#8212; that the king of Babylon would be justly plundered, because he had destroyed the holy land and iniquitously 				attacked God&#8217;s chosen people, and had also carried on his depredations through almost the whole of the Easter world.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii.xxiii-p6"></A>The Prophet now advances farther, and shows that whatever he had predicted of the future ruin of Babylon and of its monarchy, proceeded from the true God, from the God of Israel: for it would not have been sufficient to hold, that some deity existed in heaven, who ruled human affairs, so that it could not be, but that tyrants would have to suffer punishment for their cruelty. We indeed know that such sayings as these were everywhere 				common among heathen nations &#8212; that justice sits with Jupiter &#8212; that there is a Nemesis &#8212; that there is Divine vengeance. Since then such a conviction had ever been imprinted on the hearts of men, it would have been a frigid and almost an empty doctrine, had not the Prophet introduced the God of Israel. This is the reason why he now derides all idols, and claims for God the government of the whole world, and clearly shows that he speaks of the Jews, because they worshipped no imaginary gods, as 				the heathen nations, but plainly understood him to be the creator of heaven and earth, who revealed himself to Abraham, who gave his law by the hand of Moses. We now perceive the Prophet&#8217;s design.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxiii-p7"></A>As then the king of Babylon did himself worship his own gods, the Prophet dissipates that vain confidence, by which he might be deceived and deceive others. Hence he says, <i>What avails the graven image?</i> He speaks here contemptuously of images formed by men&#8217;s hands. And he adds a reason, <i>because the maker has graven it</i>, 				he says. Interpreters give a sense that is very jejune, as though the Prophet had said, &#8220;What avails a graven image, when it is graven or melted by its artifices?&#8221; But the Prophet shows here the reason why the worship of idols is useless, and that is, because these gods are made of dead materials. And then he says, &#8220;What deity can the artifices produce?&#8221; We hence see that a reason is given in these words, and therefore we may more clearly render them thus &#8212; &#8220;What avails the graven image, when 				the framer has graven it?&#8221; that is, since the graven image has its origin from the hand and skill of man, what can it avail? He then adds, <i>he has formed a molten image</i>; that is, though the artifices has given form to the metal, or to the wood, or to the stone, yet he could not have changed its nature. He has indeed given it a certain external appearance; but were any one to ask what it is, the answer would surely be, &#8220;It is a graven image.&#8221; 				Since then its nature is not changed by the work of man, it evidently appears, how stupid and mad must all those be who put their trust in graven images.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxiii-p12"></A>He then adds, <i>and a teacher of falsehood</i>. He added this clause, because men previously entertain false notions, and dare not to form a judgement on the matter itself. For, how comes it that a piece of wood or a stone is called a god? Had any one asked the sages at Rome or at Athens, or in other cities, who thought all other nations barbarous, What is that? on seeing 				a Jupiter made of silver; or of wood, or of stone, the answer would have been, &#8220;It is Jupiter, it is God.&#8221; But how could this be? It is a stone, a piece of wood, or of silver. They would yet have asserted that it was God. Whence came this madness? Even from this, because men were bewitched, so that seeing they saw not; they wilfully closed their eyes, and resolved to be blind, being unwilling to understand. This is the reason why the Prophet, by way of anticipation, says, <i>the artificer has formed </i>&#8212; what has he formed? <i>a graven image and a teacher of falsehood</i>. The material remains the same, but a false notion prevails, for men think idols to be gods. How come they to think so? It is no doubt the teaching of falsehood, a mere illusion. He then confirms the same thing; <i>the fashioner</i>, or the artificer, he says, <i>trusts in his own work</i>, or in what he has formed. How is this? Must they not be void of sense and reason who trust in lifeless things? &#8220;The workman,&#8221; as Isaiah says, &#8220;will take his instruments, will form an idol, and then he will bow the knee, and call it his god; yet it is the work of his own hands.&#8221; What! art not thou thyself a god? thou knowest thine own frailty, and yet thou createst new gods! Even in 				this manner does the Prophet confirm what he had previously said, that men are extremely stupid, nay, that they are seized with monstrous sottishness, when they ascribe a kind of deity to wood, or to a stone, or to metal. How so? because they are, he says, false imaginations.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxiii-p13"></A>And he adds, <i>that he may make dumb idols</i>. He again repeats what he had said, &#8212; that the nature of the material is not changed by men&#8217;s workmanship, when they form to themselves gods either from wood or from stone. How so? because they cannot speak. To the same purpose is what immediately follows; the next verse must therefore be added. We shall afterwards say 				something more on the general subject.</p>  <a name="iii.iii.xxiv"></A>

<p><a name="iii.iii.xxiv-p6"></A>He pursues, as I have said, the same subject, and sharply inveighs against the sottishness of men, that they call on wood and stone, as though there were some hidden power in them. <i>They say to the wood, Awake</i>; for they implored help from their idols. <i>Shall it teach?</i> Some render it thus as a question; but I take it in a 				simpler form, &#8220;It will teach;&#8221; that is, &#8220;It is a wonder that ye are so wilfully foolish; for were God to send to you no Prophet, were there no one to instruct you, yet the wood and the stone would be sufficient teachers to you: ask your idols, that is, ascertain rightly what is in them. Doubtless, the god that is made of wood or of stone, sufficiently declares by his silence that he is no god. For there is no motion in wood and stone. Where there is no vigor and no life, is it not right to feel 				assured, that there is no deity? There are, indeed, many creatures endued with feeling and motion; but the God who gives power, and motion, and feeling to the whole world, and to all its parts, does he not surpass in these respects all his creatures? Since, then, wood and stone are silent, they are teachers sufficient for you, provided ye be apt scholars.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxiv-p7"></A>We hence see how the Prophet in this way amplifies the insensibility of men; for they did not perceive what was quite manifest. The design of what follows is the same. <i>Behold, it is covered over with gold and silver</i>; that is, it is made splendid: for idolaters think that their gods are better when adorned with gold and silver; but yet <i>there is 				no breath in the midst of them</i>. &#8220;Look,&#8221; he says, &#8220;within; look within, and ye shall see that they are dead.&#8221;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">47</FONT></A>

<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref26"><a name="iii.iii.xxvi-p1"></A>Lecture One Hundred and Fourteenth</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxvi-p2"></A>We said yesterday, that the Prophet speaks now of idols, that he might deprive the king of Babylon of his vain confidence: for though heathens claim everything to themselves and to their own powers, yet their superstition in some measure dementates them. Hence the Prophet shows, that that tyrant in vain trusted in his idols, since they were things of nought. But the reasons by which he refutes idolatry ought to be noticed: he says, 				that the artifices, who formed gods, were not able to change the nature of the material, for the wood remained wood, and stone continued to be stone, and that the workmen and artifices in forming it did nothing more than make a molten image. The material then remained still the same. As to the image itself, the Prophet says, that it was mere falsehood and deception; yea, that gods made of wood or of silver, or of any other material, were instructors and teachers of falsehood, for they allured 				simple souls: and Satan spread his snares before men, when he set before their eyes these visible figures, and persuaded them that they contained something divine. Then this reasoning of the Prophet ought to be carefully observed; for he reminds us, that fictitious gods are made of lifeless and perishable materials, and that images are only the juggleries of Satan.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxvi-p3"></A>That saying of Gregory is common among the Papists, that images are the books of the ignorant; for such was his answer to Serenus, bishop of Marseilles, who turned out images from all the churches (Lib. 9, Epist. 9.) He said that he approved of his object, in wishing to correct the superstition which prevailed among the people, but that he had done what was not right in wholly taking away images, the books of the ignorant. But let us 				consider whether more faith is due to Gregory, a man imbued with many errors, (as that age was very corrupt), or to the Prophet Habakkuk, and also to Jeremiah, who announces nearly the same sentiment. Though, then, there is some speciousness in idols, yet the Prophet here reminds us that they are nothing but the impostures of Satan; for they teach falsehood. The reason also that is given is deserving of notice &#8212; that the workmen put their hope in what they themselves have formed. And it is 				indeed a thing most preposterous, that a mortal man should form his own god, and then imagine that something divine is enclosed in the very form, for deity is not in the material. The material is disregarded when unformed; but not so when it attains a beautiful shape. While the tree grows, while it produces flowers and fruit, it is deemed, as it really is, a dead thing; but when a piece of it is formed in the figure of a man, it is believed to be a god! But it is extremely absurd to suppose 				that the hand of the artifices gives deity to a dead material; for the wood is dead, and nothing is perceived but the shape given to it by man. Since, then, the artifices trusts in what he has formed, it is what seems beyond anything strange. It is hence quite evident, that men are wholly demented by the devil, when they worship their own workmanship.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxvi-p4"></A>But now, in order to press the matter more fully on idolaters, the Prophet upbraids them for calling on the wood and on the stone to awake. It is certain, that when idolaters bow the knee before what they have themselves formed, they still imagine that there are celestial gods; but when before a figure of wood or stone they call upon God, it is the same thing as though they expected help from the wood and stone; for the question is not 				here what idolaters imagine, but the thing itself is to be regarded; and this is what the Prophet most fully and plainly condemns. Since, then, the superstitious are wont to address their prayers to wood and stone, he says, that they make to themselves gods, to whom they sacrifice. And the Prophet rightly refers in express terms to this kind of service; for the chief sacrifice which God bids to be offered to him, and demands from us, is to call on him; for we thus testify that life and all 				things belonging to salvation are found alone in him. Since, then, the majesty of God appears especially from having this testimony borne to him, that he is the fountain of life and of all blessings, every one who prostrates himself before a stone or wood, and implores the aid of a visible god, transfers, no doubt, the glory of the eternal God to a dead piece of wood or to a stone. If, then, we wish to be free from every superstition, let us remember this truth, that then only we have the only 				true God, when we direct our prayers and supplications to him alone, or, in a word, when we call on him alone. When we have recourse to dead idols, God is deprived of his own right. We may call him God a hundred times, but we give him an empty title, and one of no value, except we pray to him alone.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxvi-p5"></A>The Prophet, in the last place, derides the madness of men, by saying that the very idols teach: for, as it was said yesterday, the clause is not to be read as a question, as some do; but in order more sharply to reprove the stupidity of men, the Prophet says, "Doubtless the very figures themselves, except ye are wholly senseless, will teach you.&#8221; He had before said, it is true, that they were the teachers of falsehood and vanity; but 				he speaks now of another kind of teaching, that if men wisely attended to the thing itself, they might soon learn from a mere view of their gods, that they were most palpably the deceits of Satan; for if any one looked on the idols with a clear eye, he would see that they were a dead material, and would see that great wrong is done to God by transforming him into a likeness of what is dead.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxvi-p6"></A>We now understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning, when he says, That idols themselves are sufficient, and more than sufficient teachers, when men are teachable, and lend an attentive ear. He means not, as it was said yesterday, that idols teach fallaciously to the destruction of men, while something divine is ascribed to them; but he says that they teach, if any one of a sane mind, and free from error, comes to view the idol, and forms a 				judgement of the thing itself. But superstition occupies the minds of men; and hence it is that all become the scholars of Satan, and no one applies his mind to understand the doctrine he mentions here. In short, idols teach naturally, and they teach through the artifice and delusion of Satan. They teach naturally; for by their silence they show that they are not gods, inasmuch as there is no strength in them. They teach, also, by the artifice of the devil; for they are made to claim a kind of 				divinity, and thus dazzle the minds of men, who are already corrupted by their own delusions. To the first teaching, of which the Prophet now speaks, none apply their minds; for almost all renounce nature wholly: this only lays hold on them &#8212; that idols are gods; for they make an image of the heavenly and eternal God, from whom we are at a great distance, and who does not otherwise descend to us, except through visible representations!</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxvi-p7"></A>The same truth the Prophet confirms when he says, that though these gods are covered over with gold and silver, <i>there is no breath in them</i>, or in the midst of them. In short, he means that they are mere masks; for no divinity can be without life. As then idols are dead things, it follows that they are the most palpable impostures of Satan, by which he fascinates the 				minds of men, when they thus devote themselves to dead things.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxvi-p8"></A>Moreover, whatever is here said against idols, most certainly applies to the superstitions of popery. They deny that they give divine honors to their idols; but let us consider what the Prophet says. They indeed sacrifice to gold and silver, and then bend their knees before their images, and do not think that God is near them, except in these figures. Let them show, then, that the Prophet reasons here foolishly, or let them be held 				guilty according to the declaration, as it were, of the Holy Spirit, when they thus present their prayers before idols. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.iii.xxvii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="iii.iii.xxvii-p1"></A><a name="iii.iii.xxvii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020">Habakkuk 2:20</a><a name="iii.iii.xxvii-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxvii-p2"></A><b>20.</b> But the Lord <i>is</i> in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxvii-p3"></A><b>20.</b> Jehova autem in templo sanctitatis suae (<i>id est</i>, in templo sancto suo:) sileat a facie ejus omnis terra.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxvii-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iii.iii.xxvii-p5"></A><a name="iii.iii.xxvii-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxvii-p6"></A>After having taught us that the Babylonians were deceived in expecting any help from their idols, and were deluded by Satan, Habakkuk now recalls the attention of the faithful to the only true God; for it would not have been enough to take away from the Babylonians the false confidence which they had in their idols, except the Israelites, on the other hand, trusting in the grace of the true God, were fully persuaded that God was on 				their side, as he had taken them under his protection.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxvii-p7"></A>And we ought carefully to observe this order; for we see that many boldly deride all the superstitions which prevail in the world, and at the same time daringly and with cyclopic fury despise the true God. How many are at this day either Epicureans or Lucianians, who prate jestingly and scoffingly against the superstitions of the papacy, but in the meantime they are not influenced by any fear of God? If, however, we are to choose one 				of two evils, superstition is more tolerable than that gross impiety which obliterates every thought of a God. It is indeed true, that the more the superstitious toil in their delusions, the more they provoke God&#8217;s wrath against them; for they transfer his glory to dead things; but yet they retain this principle &#8212; that honor and worship are due to God: but the profane, in whom there is no religion whatever, not only change God from what he is, but also strive as far as they can to reduce him to 				nothing. Hence I have said, that the order which the Prophet observes here ought to be maintained. For, after having overturned the false illusions of the devil, by which he deludes the superstitious, by setting before them a mere shadow in the place of the true God, he now sets up the true worship of the only true God. Then the Prophet has hitherto been endeavoring to subvert superstitions, but he now builds up: for except God, when idols are pulled down, ascends his own tribunal, and shines 				there as supreme according to his right, it would be better, at least it would be more tolerable, as I have said, that superstitions should be left entire.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxvii-p8"></A>He now says that God is <i>in his own temple </i>or palace: this word is often taken for heaven, but is applied to the sanctuary. Many consider that the reference is made to heaven; as though the Prophet had said, that the true God, who is the artificer and creator of heaven and earth, is not to be seen in a visible form, nor covered over with gold and silver, nor 				represented by wood or stone; but that he rules in heaven, and fills heaven with his infinite glory and this view is by no means unsuitable. But as he here specially addresses the Jews, it seems to me more probable that he speaks of the temple, where God then designed to be worshipped, and sacrifices to be offered to him for it would not have been sufficient to set God, the creator of heaven and earth, in opposition to the superstitions of all the nations; but it was also necessary to introduce 				the contrast between the God of Israel and all those gods who then had obtained a name and reputation in the world, as they had been formed by the will of men. The God of Israel was indeed the creator of heaven and earth; but he had made himself known by his law, he had revealed himself to men, so that his majesty was not hidden; for when we speak of God, we are lost except he comes to us, and in a manner exhibits himself to us; for the capacity of our understanding is not so great that it can 				penetrate above all heavens. Hence the majesty of God is in itself incomprehensible to us; but he makes himself known by his works and by his word. Now as the Israelites worshipped, and surely knew that they worshipped the only true God, the Prophet here rightly confirms them in the hope they derived from the teaching of the law &#8212; that God was their Father, inasmuch as he had adopted them. If any prefer to take the word for heaven, I do not object; and that meaning, as I have said, is not 				unsuitable. But as the Prophet seems to me to have a special vies to his own people, to whom he was appointed a teacher; it is more probable that the word, temple or palace, is here to be understood of the sanctuary.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxvii-p9"></A>If any raises the objection that there is then no difference between the God of Israel and the gods of the Gentiles, for he also dwells in an earthly habitation, the answer is obviously this &#8212; that though God is said to dwell between the cherubim, he has not been represented by an image, as though he had anything like to wood or stone, or possessed any likeness to human bodies. All these delusions were banished from the Temple; for he 				commanded his worshipers to look up to heaven. There was an intervening veil, that the people might understand that they could not otherwise come to God than through that celestial model, the and types of which they saw in the altar of incense, in the altar on which they sacrificed, in the table of the shewbread, in short, in all other services of the Temple. And there is another difference to be noticed; for though there was there the golden altar, though there was there the ark of the 				covenant, and the altar on which the victims were immolated, yet inscribed on all these typical representations was the word of God, by which alone true religion was to be distinguished from all false inventions. For whatever specious appearance of reason may therefore be in fictitious modes of worship, men have no authority to render them lawful; but so much reverence is due to the only true word of God, that it ought to overrule all other reasons. And besides, this word, as I have hinted 				already, did not retain the Jews in these delusions, but elevated their minds to heaven. We now then see that there was a wide difference between the Temple which was at Jerusalem, and the temples which the superstitious had then built for themselves throughout the world; for God ruled over the Jews, so that they could not have been deluded. And at this day, where the word of God shines among us, we can follow it with safety. And, further, God did spiritually draw to himself his own servants, 				though he employed, on account of their ignorance, certain outward elements. Hence the Prophet justly says, that God was in his palace or his Temple; for the Israelites knew of a certainty that they did not worship a fictitious God, since in his law he had revealed himself to them, and had chosen the sanctuary, where he intended to be worshipped in a typical, and yet in a spiritual manner.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxvii-p10"></A>He then adds, <i>Let all the earth be silent before him</i>. Habakkuk, no doubt, commends the power of God, that the Israelites might proceed with alacrity in their religious course, knowing it to be a sufficient security to be under the protection of the only true God, and that they might not seek after the superstitions of the nations, nor be carried here and there, as it 				often happens, by vain desires. <i>Keep silence</i>, then, he says, <i>let all the earth</i>. He shows that though the Israelites might be far inferior to the Babylonians and other nations, and be far unequal to them in strength, military art, forces, and, in short, in all things of this kind, yet they would be always safe under the guardianship of God; for the Lord was able to control whatever power there 				might be in the world.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxvii-p11"></A>We now see what the Prophet had in view: for he does not here simply exhort all people to worship God, but shows, that thought men may grow mad against him, he yet can easily by his hand subjugate them; for after all the tumults made by kings and their people, the Lord can, by one breath of his mouth, dissipate all their attempts, however furious they may be. This, then, is the silence of which the Prophet now speaks. But there is 				another kind of silence, and that is, when we willingly submit to God; for silence in this respect is nothing else but submission: and we submit to God, when we bring not our own inventions and imaginations, but suffer ourselves to be taught by his word. We also submit to him, when we murmur not against his power or his judgements, when we humble ourselves under his powerful hand, and do not fiercely resist him, as those do who indulge their own lusts. This is indeed, as I have said, a 				voluntary submission: but the Prophet here shows that there is power in God to lay prostrate the whole world, and to tread it under his feet, whenever it may please him; so that the faithful have nothing to fear, for they know that their salvation is secured; for though the whole world were leagued against them, it yet cannot resist God. Now follows a prayer: &#8212;</p>

The metaphor is taken from the practice of ascending a high tower, when any messenger was expected with news. That any locality is meant here is supported by nothing in the passage. The Prophet puts himself in an attitude of waiting for an answer from God to the complaints which he had made: and the metaphor of &#8220;tower and citadel&#8221; is most beautifully applied by <i>Calvin</i>, and in a very 					 instructive and striking manner.

<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent08"><a name="iii.iii.ii-p13"></A><i>And what I should reply to my arguing </i>with him. <i><br> 					 The latter renders the line thus: </i>&#8212; <i><br> 					 And what I shall reply in regard to my argument.</i></p>

He calls it &#8220;my,&#8221; because given him, either by his enemies, as <i>Calvin</i> thinks, or by God, as some others suppose. The view of <i>Piscator 					 </i>and <i>Junius</i> is, that it is the reproof or correction he administered to the people in chapter 1:2-12. He was waiting to know what he might have to give as a reply in defense of that reproof. &#8220;And what I may reply as to my reproof,&#8221; <i>i.e., </i>the reproof given by him. In this case, the preceding clause, &#8220;What he may or will say to me,&#8221; refers to his complaint respecting the 					 Chaldeans. This is altogether consistent with the mode in which the Prophets usually write: reversing the order, they take up first the last subject, and then refer to the first. He then waited to know two things, how to solve his difficulties respecting the conduct of the Chaldeans, and how to reply to his own people for the severe rebuke he gave them.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.iii.vi-p10"></A> Most authors agree in the main with <i>Calvin</i> in his exposition of this clause. The whole verse is quoted by Paul in <a name="iii.iii.vi-p10.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#039">Heb 10:39</a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p10.1"></A>, nearly <i>verbatim</i> from the Scriptures; only he inverts the clauses, and leaves out 					 the pronoun, &#8220;my,&#8221; connected with &#8220;faith.&#8221; But this clause, as quoted by him, is materially different from the Hebrew text, as it now exists, though the chief difference relates to the word [<a name="iii.iii.vi-p10.2"></A>&#1506;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;], rendered elation, or pride, by <i>Calvin </i>and many others. Two MSS. give another reading; one has [<a name="iii.iii.vi-p10.3"></A>&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1508;&#1492;], and the other, [<a name="iii.iii.vi-p10.4"></A>&#1506;&#1500;&#1508;&#1492;], which means to swoon, or to faint, or to fail.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p11"></A>This reading would essentially harmonize the passage, and the context evidently favors it, as well as the antithesis in the verse itself. As to the rest of the clause the <i>meaning </i>is same with the Septuagint version, as cited by Paul, though the words are different; and there are other examples in which the apostle did not alter that version, though varying in words, when 					 the sense was preserved. To say that man&#8217;s soul is not right in him amounts to the same thing as to say that God is not pleased with him. There is indeed one MS. which has [<a name="iii.iii.vi-p11.1"></A>&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1497;], &#8220;my soul,&#8221; and not &#8220;his soul;&#8221; and then [<a name="iii.iii.vi-p11.2"></A>&#1497;&#1513;&#1512;&#1492;] is often rendered &#7936;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#957;, to please, by the Septuagint. See <a name="iii.iii.vi-p11.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#027">Nu 23:27</a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p11.3"></A>; <a name="iii.iii.vi-p11.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#004">2Ch 30:4</a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p11.4"></A>. There would in this case be a complete identity of words as well as of meaning.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p12"></A>What especially countenances these readings is, that the alteration would agree better with the preceding verse. There is an exhortation to wait for the vision, <i>i.e., </i>its fulfillment. To refer to pride in this connection seems not suitable; but to mention fainting or failing through unbelief is quite appropriate; and then as a contrast to this state of mind, the latter 					 clause is added. Adopting the main alteration, [<a name="iii.iii.vi-p12.1"></A>&#1506;&#1500;&#1508;&#1492;] instead of [<a name="iii.iii.vi-p12.2"></A>&#1506;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;], (only a transposition of two letters,) I would render the verse thus &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="iii.iii.vi-p13"></A>Behold the fainting! not right is his soul within him; <br> 					 But the righteous, by his faith shall he live.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p14"></A>The word for &#8220;fainting&#8221; is in the feminine gender, either on account of the word &#8220;soul&#8221; in what follows, or [<a name="iii.iii.vi-p14.1"></A>&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;] is understood, the &#8220;man of fainting,&#8221; instances of which are adduced by <i>Henderson </i>on this verse, though he retains the word of the present text; as 					 [<a name="iii.iii.vi-p14.2"></A>&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1514;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;], &#8220;I am prayer,&#8221; instead of &#8220;I am a man of prayer.&#8221; &#8212; <a name="iii.iii.vi-p14.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#004">Ps. 109:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#031">Jer. 50:31</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#032">32</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#023">Dan. 9:23</a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p14.3"></A></p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p15"></A>Now not only the antithesis is here complete, but the <i>order</i> also in which it occurs corresponds with what is often the style of the Prophets; the first part of the first clause corresponds with the last part of the second, and the last of the former with the first of the latter; and not according to Dr. <i>Henderson</i>, who represents the clauses as regularly antithetic. See a similar instance in 					 <a name="iii.iii.vi-p15.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013">Hab 1:13</a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p15.1"></A>, and also in the first verse of this chapter. The man who faints, and he who lives by faith, form the contrast; and the addition &#8220;by faith&#8221; in the latter clause implies the fainting to be through want of faith, or through unbelief. Then the soul that is not right stands in contrast with the righteous, or the just in the second line. Thus every thing in the verse itself, and in its connection 					 with what precedes it, is in favor of what has been proposed. And <i>Grotius </i>and <i>Newcome </i>seemed disposed to adopt this reading. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.iii.ix-p9"></A> Though the general meaning of the beginning of this verse is what most critics agree in, yet the construction is difficult. The only difference as to the meaning is, whether the proud man is said to be given to wine, or is compared to such an one, or to wine itself. <i>Newcome</i> takes the first, and gives this version &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="iii.iii.ix-p10"></A>Moreover, as a mighty man transgresseth through wine, <br> 					 He is proud, and remaineth not at rest.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.ix-p11"></A><i>Henderson</i>, agreeing with <i>Grotius </i>and <i>Mede</i>, takes the latter sense, and renders the line as follows: &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="iii.iii.ix-p12"></A>Moreoever wine is treacherous; <br> 					 The haughty man stayeth not at home.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.ix-p13"></A>This is rather a paraphrase than a version; but this is the meaning of which the words are most capable. The two first participles need not be connected according to what <i>Calvin </i>proposes. Then the distich may be thus rendered &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent04"><a name="iii.iii.ix-p14"></A><i>And truly, as wine is treacherous, <br> 					 </i>So<i> is the proud man, and he will not rest.</i></p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.ix-p15"></A>Then follows a delineation of his character &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="iii.iii.ix-p16"></A>Because he enlarges as the grave his desire, <br> 					 And he is like death and cannot be satisfied; <br> 					 For he gathers to himself all the nations, <br> 					 And collects to himself all the people.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.ix-p17"></A>As to wine being treacherous, see <a name="iii.iii.ix-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001">Pr 30:1</a><a name="iii.iii.ix-p17.1"></A>. Wine is pleasant to the taste and inviting in its color, but degrading, when taken immoderately, in its effects; so a proud and arrogant man is at first glittering and plausible, and splendid in his appearance, but afterwards cruel and oppressive. This seems to be the most obvious similitude, as 					 contained in the passage.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.ix-p18"></A><i>Parkhurst </i>renders the two first lines as follows &#8212;</p>

<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p12"></A>Woe to him who makes his neighbor to drink, <br> 					 Who adds his bottle, and also strong drink, <br> 					 In order that he may look on their nakedness.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p13"></A>To render [<a name="iii.iii.xxi-p13.1"></A>&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;], wrath, or heat, or gall, or poison, as some have done, is to introduce an idea foreign to the context, and the word is often found to signify the bottle of skin in which wine was kept. <i>Newcome</i> renders it &#8220;flagon.&#8221; By mentioning bottle, abundance 					 of wine was probably intended, and to this abundance was added the strong drink, [<a name="iii.iii.xxi-p13.2"></A>&#1513;&#1499;&#1512;], intoxicating liquor. It is commonly rendered as though it were a verb in Hiphil; but it is not so. It means here no doubt, as in other places, strong drink. This line is only an application, as we find often in the Prophets, of the preceding line.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p14"></A>Though there is no MS. which has &#8220;his&#8221; instead of &#8220;thy&#8221; connected with &#8220;bottle,&#8221; yet the preceding and the following lines seem to require it; and this is the reading of <i>Symmachus </i>and of the <i>Vulgate</i>. The change of persons, it is true, is very common in the Prophets, but not in such a way as we find here, the third person being adopted both in the preceding and in the following line.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p15"></A>The idea of drinking as a judgment may have arisen from the cup of malediction given to criminals before their execution. See also <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p15.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008">Ps 75:8</a><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p15.1"></A>.

It was &#8220;golden&#8221; 					 to signify an outward appearance that was plausible, and alluring. So the mystic Babylon is said to have a golden cup, which was full of all abominations, <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p15.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004">Re 17:4</a><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p15.3"></A>. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p23"></A> The view presented here of the first clause of the verse is striking, and such as the words may admit. But most commentators attach to them another meaning. <i>Newcome&#8217;s</i> version is &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p24"></A>Thou art filled with shame instead of glory.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p25"></A><i>Henderson&#8217;s </i>rendering is &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p26"></A>Thou art filled with shame, not with glory.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p27"></A>The verb being in the past tense seems to favor <i>Calvin&#8217;s </i>view &#8212; &#8220;Thou hast been satiated with shame from glory,&#8221; that is, thou hast been filled to satiety with the shame occasioned to others, arising from the pursuit of thine own glory. And then, as <i>Calvin</i> justly observes, his punishment is denounced. &#8212; &#8220;Drink thou also.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p31"></A> The verb [<a name="iii.iii.xxi-p31.1"></A>&#1514;&#1505;&#1493;&#1489;], loosely expressed here, is very correctly rendered by <i>Henderson</i> &#8220;shall come round;&#8221; and this is the idea which <i>Calvin</i> suggests in the following explanation. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_43"></A><A HREF="cc29005.htm#fr_43">44</A> <a name="iii.iii.xxi-p32.2"></A>   				  
<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.iii.xxi-p33"></A> It is commonly derived from [<a name="iii.iii.xxi-p33.1"></A>&#1511;&#1497;], a contraction of [<a name="iii.iii.xxi-p33.2"></A>&#1511;&#1497;&#1488;], a vomit or spewing, and [<a name="iii.iii.xxi-p33.3"></A>&#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1494;], 					 shame. Compounds are no common things in Hebrew; and these are found separate in nine MSS. The <i>Septuagint</i> have &#7936;&#964;&#953;&#956;&#953;&#945;, reproach only; and the <i>Vulgate</i>, &#8220;<a name="iii.iii.xxi-p33.4"></A>vomitus ignominiae &#8212; the spewing of shame.&#8221; <i>Newcome</i> renders it &#8220;foul shame,&#8221; and <i>Henderson</i> &#8220;great ignominy,&#8221; regarding it as a reduplicate noun for [<a name="iii.iii.xxi-p33.5"></A>&#1511;&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1494;]. But as drunkenness is the metaphor used, &#8220;shameful spewing,&#8221; or the spewing of shame or of reproach is most suitable to the passage. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_44"></A><A HREF="cc29005.htm#fr_44">45</A> <a name="iii.iii.xxii-p8.5"></A>   				  
<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.iii.xxii-p9"></A> It is commonly agreed, that Libanus here means either the temple or the land of Judah; most probably the last, according to the opinion of <i>Jerome</i>, <i>Drusius</i>, and others. The &#8220;violence,&#8221; or outrage, of Libanus, means the violence <i>done </i>to it, as <i>Newcome 					 </i>and others render the clause. The next line is more difficult: if the verb be retained as it is, we must either adopt what <i>Calvin</i> has proposed, and after him <i>Drusius</i>, or take the [<a name="iii.iii.xxii-p9.1"></A>&#1493;] at the beginning as a particle of comparison, according to what is done by 					 <i>Henderson</i>, &#8220;As the destruction of beasts terrifieth them.&#8221; But to preserve the parallelism of the two lines, it would be better to adopt the correction of all the early versions, <i>Sept. Arab. Syr. </i>and also of the <i>Chald.</i> <i>par.;</i> which substitute [<a name="iii.iii.xxii-p9.2"></A>&#1491;] for [<a name="iii.iii.xxii-p9.3"></A>&#1494;] and make the verb to be [<a name="iii.iii.xxii-p9.4"></A>&#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1491;]: and there are two MSS. which have [<a name="iii.iii.xxii-p9.5"></A>&#1497;&#1495;&#1514;]. In 					 this case the rendering would be the following &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="iii.iii.xxii-p10"></A>Because the violence done to Libanus shall overwhelm thee; <br> 					 And the depredation done to the beasts shall rend thee; <br> 					 On account of the blood of men, and of violence to the land, <br> 					 To the city, and to all who dwelt in it.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxii-p11"></A>The reason men are called &#8220;beasts&#8221; is because Libanus is mentioned which was inhabited by beasts; and in the two following lines the statement is more clear, and according to the order usually observed, &#8220;the depredation done to beasts&#8221; is &#8220;the blood of men;&#8221; and &#8220;the violence to Libanus&#8221; is &#8220;violence to the land.&#8221; And then, as it is often the case in the Prophets, there is an addition made to the two last lines, &#8220;To the city,&#8221; etc. &#8212; 					 <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.iii.xxiii-p8"></A> Rightly to understand this verse, it is necessary to remember that the graven and the molten image was the same; it was first graven and then covered with some metal, either of gold or of silver. See Note on <a name="iii.iii.xxiii-p8.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#007">Micah 1:7</a><a name="iii.iii.xxiii-p8.1"></A>, vol. 3, p. 167.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxiii-p9"></A>This verse, as given in our version and in that of <i>Newcome</i>, presents hardly a meaning; and <i>Henderson</i> is not justified in the peculiar sense he gives to the particle [<a name="iii.iii.xxiii-p9.1"></A>&#1499;&#1497;], taking it as a relative pronoun. The 					 rendering of <i>Calvin </i>gives an evident and a striking sense. The verse may be thus literally rendered &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent09"><a name="iii.iii.xxiii-p10"></A>18.<b> What avails the graven image? &#8212; <br> 					 For its graver has formed it, &#8212; <br> 					 The molten image and the teacher of falsehood? <br> 					 For trust in it does the former of its form, <br> 					 After having made dumb idols.</b></p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxiii-p11"></A>The last line show that the singular number before used is to be taken in a collective sense: and the preposition [<a name="iii.iii.xxiii-p11.1"></A>&#1500;] before an infinitive has sometimes the meaning of &#8220;after.&#8221; See <a name="iii.iii.xxiii-p11.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001">Ex 19:1</a><a name="iii.iii.xxiii-p11.2"></A>, 					 &#8220;When he has made,&#8221; etc., is the rendering of <i>Grotius</i>. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.iii.xxiv-p8"></A> With the exception of the clause, &#8220;It will teach,&#8221; there is a general agreement in the mode of rendering this verse. &#8220;Shall it teach,&#8221; is <i>Newcome&#8217;s</i> version. <i>Henderson</i> considers it to be ironical, &#8220;It teach!&#8221; <i>Grotius</i> agrees with <i>Calvin</i>, &#8220;It will itself teach thee,&#8221; that is, that it is deaf, and no god. I regard the verse as capable of a simpler and more literal rendering, as follows:</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent08"><a name="iii.iii.xxiv-p9"></A>19.<i> Woe to him who saith to the wood, &#8220;Awake, Arise;&#8221; <br> 					 To the dumb stone, &#8220;It will teach:&#8221; <br> 					 Behold, it is covered with gold and silver! <br> 					 Yet there is no breath within it.</i></p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.iii.xxiv-p10"></A>The two verbs, &#8220;Awake, Arise,&#8221; stand connected with &#8220;wood,&#8221; and they are so given in the Septuagint; and there is a striking contrast between the dumb stone and teaching. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>
