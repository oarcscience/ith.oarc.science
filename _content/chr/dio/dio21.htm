<p align="center"><a name="ii.iii.ii.iii-p1"></A>What are the affirmative expressions respecting God, and what  the negative.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.iii.ii.iii-p2"></A>SECTION I.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iii.ii.iii-p3"></A>IN the <i>Theological Outlines, </i>then, we celebrated the principal affirmative  expressions respecting God--how the Divine and good Nature is spoken of as One--how  as Threefold--what is that within it which is spoken of as Paternity and Sonship--what  the Divine name of "the Spirit "is meant to signify,--how from the immaterial and  indivisible Good the Lights dwelling in the heart of Goodness sprang forth, and  remained, in their branching forth, without departing from the coeternal abiding  in Himself and in Themselves and in each other,--how the super-essential Jesus takes  substance in veritable human nature--and whatever other things, made known by the  Oracles, are celebrated throughout the <i>Theological Outlines; </i>and in the treatise  concerning <i>Divine Names, </i>how He is named Good--how Being--how Life and Wisdom  and Power--and whatever else belongs to the nomenclature of God. Further, in the <i>Symbolical Theology, </i>what are the Names transferred from objects of sense  to things Divine?--what are the Divine forms?--what the Divine appearances, and parts  and organs?--what the Divine places and ornaments?--what the angers?--what the griefs?--and  the Divine wrath?--what the carousals, and the ensuing sicknesses?--what the oaths,--and  what the  <A NAME="page_135"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 135</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iii.ii.iii-Page_135"></A> curses?--what the sleepings, and what the awakings?--and all the other  Divinely formed representations, which belong to the description of God, through  symbols. And I imagine that you have comprehended, how the lowest are expressed  in somewhat more words than the first. For, it was necessary that the <i>Theological  Outlines, </i>and the unfolding of the Divine Names should be expressed in fewer  words than the <i>Symbolic Theology; </i>since, in proportion as we ascend to the  higher, in such a degree the expressions are circumscribed by the contemplations  of the things intelligible. As even now, when entering into the gloom which is above  mind, we shall find, not a little speaking, but a complete absence of speech, and  absence of conception. In the other case, the discourse, in descending from the  above to the lowest, is widened according to the descent, to a proportionate extent;  but now, in ascending from below to that which is above, in proportion to the ascent,  it is contracted, and after a complete ascent, it will become wholly voiceless,  and will be wholly united to the unutterable. But, for what reason in short, you  say, having attributed the Divine attributes from the foremost, do we begin the  Divine abstraction from things lowest? Because it is necessary that they who place  attributes on that which is above every attribute, should place the attributive  affirmation from that which is more cognate to it; but that they who abstract, with  regard to that which is above every abstraction, should make the abstraction from  things which are further removed from it. Are not  <A NAME="page_136"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 136</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iii.ii.iii-Page_136"></A>life and goodness more (cognate) than air and stone? and He is not given  to debauch and to wrath, more (removed) than He is not expressed nor conceived.</p>
