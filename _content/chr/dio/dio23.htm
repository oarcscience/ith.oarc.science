But when making the predications and abstractions  of things after It, we neither predicate, nor abstract from It; since the all-perfect  and uniform Cause of all is both above every definition and the pre-eminence of  Him, Who is absolutely freed from all, and beyond the whole, is also above every  abstraction.</p>
