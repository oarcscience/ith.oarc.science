<p align="center"><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p2"></A>SECTION I.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p3"></A>The histories of the Hebrews say, O noble Demophilus, that, even that holy, distinguished  Moses was deemed worthy of the Divine manifestation on account of his great meekness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">85</FONT></A>
. And, if at any time they describe him as being  excluded from the vision&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">86</FONT></A>
 of God, they do not cast  him out from God for his meekness. But they say that when speaking very rashly,  and opposing the Divine Counsels, Jehovah was angry with him with wrath. But when  they make him proclaimed by his God-discerned deserts, he is proclaimed, from his  pre-eminent imitation of the Good. For he was very meek, and on this account is  called "Servant of God," and deemed more fit for vision of God than all Prophets.  Now, when certain envious&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">87</FONT></A>
 people were contending  with him and Aaron, about the High Priesthood and government of the tribes, he was  superior to all love of honour, and love of rule, and referred the presidency over  the people to the Divine judgment. And, when they even rose up against him, and  reproaching him concerning the precedency, were threatening him, and were already  almost upon him, the meek man invoked the Good for preservation, but very suitably  asserted that <A NAME="page_151"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 151</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_151"></A> he would be guiltless  of all evils to the governed. For he knew that it is necessary, that the familiar  with God the Good should be moulded, as far as is attainable, to that which is specially  most like the Good, and should be conscious within himself of the performance of  deeds of good friendship. And what made David&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">88</FONT></A>
, the  father of God, a friend of God? Even for being good and generous towards enemies&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">89</FONT></A>
. The Super-Good, and the Friend of Good says--"I have found a man after mine own heart." Further also, a generous injunction was  given, to care for even one&#8217;s enemy&#8217;s beasts of burden&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">90</FONT></A>
.  And Job&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">91</FONT></A>
 was pronounced just, as being free from  injury. And Joseph&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">92</FONT></A>
 did not take revenge upon the  brethren who had plotted against him; and Abel, at once, and without suspicion,  accompanied the fratricide. And the Word of God proclaims all the good as not devising  evil things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_92"></A><A HREF="#fn_92"><FONT SIZE="1">93</FONT></A>
, not doing them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">94</FONT></A>
,  but neither being changed from the good, by the baseness of others&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_94"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">95</FONT></A>
, but, on the contrary, after  the example of God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">96</FONT></A>
, as doing good to, and throwing their shield over  the evil; and generously calling them to their own abundant goodness, and to their  own similitude. But let us ascend higher, not proclaiming the gentleness of holy  men, nor kindness of philanthropic angels, who take compassion upon nations, and  invoke good&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">97</FONT></A>
 on their behalf, and punish the  <A NAME="page_152"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 152</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_152"></A> destructive and devastating mobs,  and, whilst being grieved over calamities, yet rejoice over the safety of those  who are being called back to things good&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">98</FONT></A>
; nor whatever  else the Word of God teaches concerning the beneficent angels&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">99</FONT></A>
; but, whilst in silence welcoming the beneficent rays of the really  good and super-good Christ, by them let us be lighted on our path, to His Divine  works of Goodness. For assuredly is it not of a Goodness inexpressible and beyond  conception, that He makes all things existing to be, and brought all things themselves  to being, and wishes all things ever to become near to Himself, and participants  of Himself, according to the aptitude of each? And why? Because He clings lovingly  to those who even depart from Him, and strives&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_99"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">100</FONT></A>
 and  beseeches not to be disowned by those beloved who are themselves coy; and He bears  with those who heedlessly reproach Him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">101</FONT></A>
, and Himself  makes excuse for them, and further promises to serve them, and runs towards and  meets&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_101"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">102</FONT></A>
 even those who hold themselves aloof, immediately  that they approach; and when His entire self has embraced their entire selves, He  kisses them, and does not reproach them for former things, but rejoices over the  present, and holds a feast, and calls together the friends, that is to say, the  good, in order that the household may be altogether rejoicing. (But, Demophilus,  of all persons in the world, is at enmity <A NAME="page_153"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 153</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_153"></A>   with, and very justly rebukes, and teaches beautiful things to, good men, and rejoices.)  "For how," He says, "ought not the good to rejoice over safety of the lost, and  over life of those who are dead." And, as a matter of course, He raises upon His  shoulders that which with difficulty has been turned from error, and summons the  good angels to rejoicing, and is generous to the unthankful, and makes His sun to  rise upon evil and good, and presents His very soul&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">103</FONT></A>
  as an offering on behalf of those who are fleeing from Him.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p4"></A>But thou, as thy letters testify, I do not know how, being in thy senses, hast  spurned one fallen down before the priest, who, as thou sayest, was unholy and a  sinner. Then this one entreated and confessed that he has come for healing of evil  deeds, but thou didst not shiver, but even insolently didst cover with abuse the  good priest, for shewing compassion to a penitent, and justifying the unholy. And  at last, thou saidst to the priest, "Go out with thy like"; and didst burst, contrary  to permission, into the sanctuary, and defiledst the Holy of holies, and writest  to us, that "I have providentially preserved the things sacred, which were about  to be profaned, and am still keeping them undefiled."</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p5"></A>Now, then, hear our view. It is not lawful that a priest should be corrected  by the Leitourgoi, who are above thee, or by the Therapeutae, who are of the same  rank with thee; even though he should seem to <A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_154"></A>   act irreverently towards things Divine, and though he should be convicted of having  done some other thing forbidden. For, if want of order, and want of regulation,  is a departure from the most Divine institutions and decrees, it is not reasonable  that the divinely transmitted order should be changed on God&#8217;s behalf. For Almighty  God is not divided against Himself, for, "how then shall His kingdom stand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">104</FONT></A>
?" And if the judgment is of God, as the Oracles  affirm&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">105</FONT></A>
, and the priests are angels and interpreters,  after the hierarchs, of the Divine judgments, learn from them through whom thou  wast deemed worthy to be a Therapeutes, through the intermediate Leitourgoi, when  opportunity serves, the things Divine suitable for thyself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">106</FONT></A>
.  And do not the Divine Symbols proclaim this, for is not the Holy of holies altogether  simply separated from all, and the order of the consecrators is in closer proximity  to it than the rank of the priests, and following these, that of the Leitourgoi.  But the gates of the sanctuary are bounded by the appointed Therapeutae, within  which they are both ordained, and around which they stand, not to guard them, but  for order, and teaching of themselves that they are nearer the people than the priesthood.  Whence the holy regulation of the priests orders them to participate in things Divine,  enjoining the impartation of these to others, that is to say, the more inward. For  even those who always stand <A NAME="page_155"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_155"></A> around  the Divine Altar, for a symbolical purpose, see and hear things Divine revealed  to themselves in all clearness; and advancing generously to things outside the Divine  Veils, they shew, to the subject Therapeutae, and to the holy people, and to the  orders under purification, according to their meetness, things holy which had been  beautifully guarded without pollution, until thou didst tyrannically burst into  them, and compelledst the Holy of holies, against its will, to be strutted over  by thee, and thou sayest, that thou holdest and guardest the sacred things, although  thou neither hast known, nor heard, nor possessest any of the things belonging to  the priests; as neither hast thou known the truth of the Oracles, whilst cavilling  about them each day to subversion of the hearers. And even if same civil Governor  undertook what was not commanded him by a King, justly would any one of the subordinates  standing by be punished who dared to criticise the Governor, when justifying, or  condemning any one; (for I do not go so far as to say to vituperate), and at the  same time thought to cast him from his government; but thou, man, art thus rash  in what concerns the affairs of the meek and good, and his hierarchical jurisdiction.  We are bound to say these things, when any one undertakes what is above his rank,  and at the same time thinks that he acts properly. For this is not within the powers  of any one. For what was Ozias&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">107</FONT></A>
 doing out of place,  when offering incense to Almighty God? and what Saul&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">108</FONT></A>
  in sacrificing? <A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_156"></A></p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p6"></A>Yea, further, what were those domineering demons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">109</FONT></A>
,  who were truly proclaiming the Lord Jesus God? But every one who meddles with other  people&#8217;s business, is outlawed by the Word of God; and each one shall be in the  rank of his own service, and alone the High Priest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">110</FONT></A>
  shall enter into the Holy of holies, and once only throughout the year&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">111</FONT></A>
, and this in the full  legal hierarchical purification&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">112</FONT></A>
. And the priests&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">113</FONT></A>
 encompass  the holy things, and the Levites must not touch the holy things, lest they die.  And Jehovah was angry with wrath at the rashness of Ozias, and Mariam&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">114</FONT></A>
 becomes leprous, because she had presumed to lay  down laws for the lawgiver. And the demons fastened on the sons of Sceva, and He  says, "I did not send them, yet they ran, and I spake not to them yet they prophesied&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">115</FONT></A>
."  "And the profane&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">116</FONT></A>
 who  sacrifices to me a calf, (is) as he who slays a dog," and to speak briefly, the  all-perfect justice of Almighty God does not tolerate the disregarders of law,  but whilst they are saying "in Thy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">117</FONT></A>
 Name,  we ourselves did many wonderful works," He retorts, "And I know you not; go from  Me all ye workers of lawlessness." So that it is not permissible, as the holy Oracles  say, even to pursue things that are just, when not according to order&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">118</FONT></A>
, but each must keep to  himself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">119</FONT></A>
, and not meditate things too high and  too deep for him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">120</FONT></A>
, but  <A NAME="page_157"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 157</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_157"></A> contemplate alone things prescribed for him according to order.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p7"></A>SECTION II.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p8"></A>" What then," thou sayest, "is it not necessary to correct the priests who are  acting irreverently, or convicted of something else out of place, but to those only,  who glory in law, shall it be permitted to dishonour Almighty God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">121</FONT></A>
, through the transgression of the Law? "And how are the priests  interpreters&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">122</FONT></A>
 of Almighty God? For, how do they announce  to the people the Divine virtues, who do not know the power of them? or how do they,  who are in darkness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">123</FONT></A>
, communicate light? Further,  how do they impart the Divine Spirit, who, by habit and truth do not believe whether  there is a Holy Spirit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="#fn_123"><FONT SIZE="1">124</FONT></A>
? Now I will give thee an  answer to these things. For truly my Demophilus is not an enemy, nor will I tolerate  that thou shouldst be overreached by Satan.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p9"></A>For each rank of those about God, is more godlike than that which stands further  away. And those which are somewhat nearer to the true light, are at once more luminous,  and more illuminating; and do not understand the nearness topically, but according  to God-receptive aptitude. If, then, the order of the priests is the illuminating,  entirely has he fallen from the priestly rank and power, who does not illuminate,  or perhaps rather (he becomes) the unilluminated. <A NAME="page_158"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 158</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_158"></A>   And he seems, to me at least, rash who, being such,  undertakes the priestly functions, and has no fear, and does not blush, when performing  things Divine, contrary to propriety, and fancying that God does not know the very  things of which he is conscious in himself, and thinks to mislead Him Who is falsely  called by him Father, and presumes to repeat his cursed blasphemies (for I would  not say prayers) over the Divine symbols, after the example of Christ. This one  is not a priest,--No!--but devilish--crafty --a deceiver of himself--and  a wolf to the people of God, clothed in sheep&#8217;s clothing.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p10"></A>SECTION III.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p11"></A>But, it is not to Demophilus that it is permitted to put these things straight.  For, if the Word of God commands to pursue just things justly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">125</FONT></A>
 (but to pursue just things is, when any one wishes to distribute  to each one things that are meet), this must be pursued by all justly, not beyond  their own meetness or rank&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">126</FONT></A>
; since even to angels  it is just that things meet be assigned and apportioned, but not from us, O Demophilus,  but through them to us, of God, and to them through the angels who are still more  pre-eminent. And to speak shortly, amongst all existing things their due is assigned  through the first to the second, by the well-ordered and most just forethought of  all. Let those, then, who have been ordered by God to superintend others,  <A NAME="page_159"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 159</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_159"></A> distribute after themselves their  due to their inferiors. But, let Demophilus apportion their due to reason and anger  and passion; and let him not maltreat the regulation of himself, but let the superior  reason bear rule over things inferior. For, if one were to see, in the market-place,  a servant abusing a master, and a younger man, an elder; or also a son, a father;  and in addition attacking and inflicting wounds, we should seem even to fail in  reverence if we did not run and succour the superior, even though perhaps they were  first guilty of injustice; how then shall we not blush, when we see reason maltreated  by anger and passion, and cast out of the sovereignty given by God; and when we  raise in our own selves an irreverent and unjust disorder, and insurrection and  confusion? Naturally, our blessed Law-giver from God does not deem right that one  should preside over the Church of God, who has not already well presided over his  own house&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">127</FONT></A>
. For, he who has governed himself will  also govern another; and who, another, will also govern a house; and who, a house,  also a city; and who, a city, also a nation. And to speak briefly as the Oracles  affirm, "he who is faithful in little, is faithful also in much," and "he who is  unfaithful in little, is unfaithful also in much."</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p12"></A>SECTION IV.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p13"></A>Thyself, then, assign their due limit to passion and anger and reason. And to  thyself, let the divine <A NAME="page_160"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 160</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_160"></A> Leitourgoi  assign the due limit, and to these, the priests, and to the priests, hierarchs,  and to the hierarchs, the Apostles and the successors of the Apostles. And if, perchance,  any, even among these, should have failed in what is becoming, he shall be put right  by the holy men of the same rank; and rank shall not be turned against rank, but  each shall be in his own rank, and in his own service. So much for thee, from us,  on behalf of knowing and doing one&#8217;s own business. But, concerning the inhuman treatment  towards that man, whom thou callest "irreverent and sinner," I know not how I shall  bewail the scandal of my beloved. For, of whom dost thou suppose thou wast ordained  Therapeutes by us? For if it were not of the Good, it is necessary that thou shouldst  be altogether alien from Him and from us, and from our whole religion, and it is  time for thee both to seek a God, and other priests, and amongst them to become  brutal rather than perfected, and to be a cruel minister of thine own fierceness.  For, have we ourselves, forsooth, been perfected to the altogether Good, and have  no need of the divine compassion for ourselves&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">128</FONT></A>
,  or do we commit the double sin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">129</FONT></A>
, as the Oracles say,  after the example of the unholy, not knowing in what we offend, but even justifying  ourselves and supposing we see, whilst really not seeing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">130</FONT></A>
?  Heaven was startled at this, and I shivered, and I distrust myself. And  <A NAME="page_161"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 161</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_161"></A> unless I had met with thy letters  (as know well I would I had not), they would not have persuaded me if indeed any  other had thought good to persuade me concerning thee, that Demophilus supposes,  that Almighty God, Who is good to all, is not also compassionate towards men, and  that he himself has no need of the Merciful or the Saviour; yea further, he deposes  those priests who are deemed worthy, through clemency, to bear the ignorances of  the people, and who well know, that they also are compassed with infirmity. But,  the supremely Divine Priest pursued a different (course), and that as the Oracles  say, from being separate of sinners, and makes the most gentle tending of the sheep  a proof of the love towards Himself; and He stigmatizes as wicked, him who did not  forgive his fellow-servant the debt, nor impart a portion of that manifold goodness,  graciously given to himself; and He condemns him to enjoy his own deserts, which  both myself and Demophilus must take care to avoid. For, even for those who were  treating Him impiously, at the very time of His suffering, He invokes remission  from the Father; and He rebukes even the disciples, because without mercy they thought  it right to convict of impiety the Samaritans who drove Him away. This, indeed,  is the thousand times repeated theme of thy impudent letter (for thou repeatest  the same from beginning to end), that thou hast avenged, <A NAME="page_162"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 162</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_162"></A>   not thyself, but Almighty God. Tell me (dost thou  avenge) the Good by means of evil?</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p14"></A>SECTION V.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p15"></A>Avaunt! We have not a High Priest, "Who cannot be touched with our infirmities,  but is both without sin and merciful." "He shall not strive nor cry, and is Himself  meek, and Himself propitiatory for our sins; so that we will not approve your unenviable  attacks, not if you should allege a thousand times your Phineas and your Elias.  For, when the Lord Jesus heard these things, He was displeased with the disciples,  who at that time lacked the meek and good spirit. For, even our most divine preceptor  teaches in meekness those who opposed themselves to the teaching of Almighty God.  For, we must teach, not avenge ourselves upon, the ignorant, as we do not punish  the blind, but rather lead them by the hand. But thou, after striking him on the  cheek, rustiest upon that man, who is beginning to rise to the truth, and when he  is approaching with much modesty, thou insolently kickest him away (certainly, this  is enough to make one shudder), whom the Lord Christ, as being good, seeks, when  wandering upon the mountains, and calls to Him, when fleeing from Him, and when,  with difficulty, found, places upon His shoulders. Do not, I pray, do not let us  thus injuriously counsel for ourselves, nor drive the sword against ourselves. For  they, who undertake to injure any one, or on <A NAME="page_163"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 163</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_163"></A>   the contrary to do them good, do not always effect what they wish, but for themselves,  when they have brought into their house vice or virtue, will be filled either with  Divine virtues, or ungovernable passions. And these indeed, as followers and companions  of good angels, both here and there, with all peace and freedom from all evil, will  inherit the most blessed inheritances for the ever-continuing age, and will be ever  with God, the greatest of all blessings; but, the other will fall both from the  divine and their own peace, and here, and after death, will be companions with cruel  demons. For which reason, we have an earnest desire to become companions of God, the Good, and to be ever with the Lord, and not to be separated, along with  the evil, from the most Just One, whilst undergoing that which is due from ourselves,  which I fear most of all, and pray to have no share in anything evil. And, with  your permission, I will mention a divine vision of a certain holy man, and do not  laugh, for I am speaking true.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p16"></A>SECTION VI.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p17"></A>When I was once in Crete, the holy Carpus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">131</FONT></A>
 entertained  me,--a man, of all others, most fitted, on account of great purity of mind, for  Divine Vision. Now, he never undertook the holy celebrations of the Mysteries, unless  a propitious vision were first manifested to him during his preparatory devout  <A NAME="page_164"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 164</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_164"></A> prayers. He said then, when some  one of the unbelievers had at one time grieved him (and his grief was, that he had  led astray to ungodliness a certain member of the Church, whilst the days of rejoicing  were still being celebrated for him); that he ought compassionately to have prayed  on behalf of both, and taking God, the Saviour, as his fellow-helper, to convert  the one, and to overcome the other by goodness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">132</FONT></A>
,  and not to have ceased warning them so long as he lived until this day; and thus  to lead them to the knowledge of God, so that the things disputed by them might  be clearly determined, and those, who were irrationally bold, might be compelled  to be wiser by a judgment according to law. Now, as he had never before experienced  this, I do not know how he then went to bed with such a surfeit of ill-will and  bitterness. In this evil condition he went to sleep, for it was evening, and at  midnight (for he was accustomed at that appointed hour to rise, of his own accord,  for the Divine melodies) he arose, not having enjoyed, undisturbed, his slumbers,  which were many and continually broken; and, when he stood collected for the, Divine  Converse, he was guiltily vexed and displeased, saying, that it was not just that  godless men, who pervert the straight ways of the Lord, should live. And, whilst  saying this, he besought Almighty God, by some stroke of lightning, suddenly, without  mercy, to cut short the lives of them both. But, whilst saying this, he declared,  <A NAME="page_165"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 165</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_165"></A> that he seemed to see suddenly the  house in which he stood, first torn asunder, and from the roof divided into two  in the midst, and a sort of gleaming fire before his eyes (for the place seemed  now under the open sky) borne down from the heavenly region close to him; and, the  heaven itself giving way, and upon the back of the heaven, Jesus, with innumerable  angels, in the form of men, standing around Him. This indeed, he saw, above, and  himself marvelled; but below, when Carpus had bent down, he affirmed that he saw  the very foundation ripped in two, to a sort of yawning and dark chasm, and those  very men, upon whom he had invoked a curse, standing before his eyes, within the  mouth of the chasm, trembling, pitiful, only just not yet carried down by the mere  slipping of their feet; and from below the chasm, serpents, creeping up and gliding  from underneath, around their feet, now contriving to drag them away, and weighing  them down, and lifting them up, and again inflaming or irritating with their teeth  or their tails, and all the time endeavouring to pull them down into the yawning  gulf; and that certain men also were in the midst, co-operating with the serpents  against these men, at once tearing and pushing and beating them down. And they seemed  to be on the point of falling, partly against their will, partly by their will;  almost overcome by the calamity, and at the same time resigned. And Carpus said,  that he himself was glad, whilst looking below, and that he was forgetful of the  things <A NAME="page_166"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 166</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_166"></A> above; further, that he was  vexed and made light of it, because they had not already fallen, and that he often  attempted to accomplish the fact, and that, when he did not succeed, he was both  irritated and cursed. And, when with difficulty he raised himself, he saw the heaven  again, as he saw it before, and Jesus, moved with pity at what was taking place,  standing up from His supercelestial throne, and descending to them, and stretching  a helping hand, and the angels, co-operating with Him, taking hold of the two men,  one from one place and another from, another, and the Lord Jesus said to Carpus,  whilst His hand was yet extended, "Strike against Me in future, for I am ready,  even again, to suffer for the salvation of men; and this is pleasing to Me, provided  that other men do not commit sin. But see, whether it is well for thee to exchange  the dwelling in the chasm, and with serpents, for that with God, and the good and  philanthropic angels." These are the things which I heard myself, and believe to  be true.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p18"></A>TITUS.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-p19"></A>ZENAS, one of the seventy-two disciples, who was versed in the science of law,  wrote a life of Titus, and says that he was descended from the family of Minos,  King of Crete. Titus gave himself to the study of Homer and Philosophy till his  twentieth year, when he heard a voice from heaven, which told him to quit this place  and save his soul. He <A NAME="page_167"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 167</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.viii-Page_167"></A> waited one  year, to test the truth of the voice, and then had a revelation which bade him read  the Hebrew Scriptures. Opening Isaiah, his eye fell on chapter xli. vv  1-5.  He was then sent to Jerusalem by the pro-consul of Crete to report upon the reality  of the miracles said to be performed by Jesus Christ. He saw our Saviour, and His  miracles, and believed; and became one of the seventy-two. He witnessed the Passion  and Ascension; the Apostles consecrated him, and sent him with Paul, whom he attended  to Antioch, to Seleucia and to Crete, where Rutilus, pro-consul, was baptized, and  Titus appointed Bishop. In A.D. 64, St. Paul addressed his Epistle to Titus, and  about the same time Dionysius also, this letter. Dexter records that Titus visited  Spain, and that Pliny, the younger, was converted to the Faith by Titus. He consecrated  the second Bishop of Alexandria, and died at the age of 94.</p>
