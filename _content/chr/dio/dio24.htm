<p><a name="ii.iv.i-p1"></A>THESE Letters attest the existence of the writings, and the wisdom spoken among  the perfect, in the Apostolic Age.--To Gaius, who is commemorated by St. John  and St. Paul, we owe the explanation of <i>Agnosia</i>, and valued teaching  on the Personality of our Lord; to Dorotheus we are indebted for a fuller explanation  of the Divine Gloom; to Sosipater, twice mentioned in the Acts and Romans, we owe  the wisest letter ever penned for the instruction of the Christian Apologist and  Missionary. The Letter to Polycarp touches on those mysterious signs in the heavens,  by which Almighty God shewed His universal power. Dionysius shews his reverence  for God&#8217;s holy word, by never seeking to explain away, or to substitute what seems  a less miracle for a greater. The trifold Mithra commemorated amongst the Babylonians  shews that Hezekiah&#8217;s sign was not merely visible and observed in Judea. The King,  as High Priest of his people, was already robed for evening prayer, when he observed  the sun gone back; and one day became almost three, i.e. thirty-two hours instead  of thirty-six. Dionysius describes the darkness at the time of the Crucifixion,  as it  <A NAME="page_p140"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. p140</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.i-Page_p140"></A> appeared in Egypt, and is recorded by Phlegon. We do not explain  and interpret the facts recorded in the Gospel, by denying them, or by treating  the same testimony outside the Gospel as superstitious.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.i-p2"></A>To Demophilus, we owe a knowledge of Church-law and order, which teaches the  Christian duty of being "sent," and which should teach clergy to obey their Bishop,  and not merely the Act of uniformity. To Titus, we owe the preservation of the  sum of the <i>Symbolic Theology. </i>From the letter to St. John in Patmos, we learn  the love between St. John arid Dionysius, and that St. John was then Called the  "Sun of the Gospel." From the letter to Apollophanes, we know that the prayers of  Dionysius for the conversion of his friend did not fall to the ground. Apollophanes  was tutor to Polemon, who again was tutor to Aristides, who presented his "Apology" to the Emperor Hadrian. The conversion of Statonice, the wife of Apollophanes,  was the cause of St. Paul&#8217;s being cast into chains at Philippi, where the messengers  from Corinth found him, through whom he sent the Epistle recently brought to light&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A>
