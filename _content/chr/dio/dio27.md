<span id="ii.iv.ii.iii-p2"></span>"Sudden" is that which, contrary to
expectation, and out of the, as yet, unmanifest, is brought into the
manifest. But with regard to Christ’s love of man, I think that the Word
of God suggests even this, that the Superessential proceeded forth out
of the hidden, into the manifestation amongst us, by having taken
substance as man. But, He is hidden, even after the manifestation, or to
speak more divinely, even in the manifestation, for in truth this of
Jesus has been kept hidden, and the mystery with respect to Him has been
reached by no word nor mind, but even when spoken, remains unsaid, and
when conceived unknown. <span id="page_143">p. 143</span> <span
