<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.x-p2"></A>I salute thee, the holy soul! O beloved one! and this for me is more appropriate  than for most. Hail! O truly beloved! And to the truly Loveable and Desired, very  beloved! Why should it be a marvel, if Christ speaks truly, and the unjust banish  His disciples from their cities&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">134</FONT></A>
, themselves bringing  upon themselves their due, and the accursed severing themselves, and departing from  the holy. Truly <A NAME="page_179"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 179</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-Page_179"></A> things seen are  manifest images of things unseen. For, neither in the ages which are approaching,  will Almighty God be Cause of the just separations from Himself, but they by having  separated themselves entirely from Almighty God; even as we observe the others,  becoming here already with Almighty God, since being lovers of truth, they depart  from the proclivities of things material, and love peace in a complete freedom from  all things evil, and a Divine love of all things good; and start their purification,  even from the present life, by living, in the midst of mankind, the life which is  to come, in a manner suitable to angels, with complete cessation of passion, and  deification and goodness, and the other good attributes. As for you then, I would  never be so crazy as to imagine that you feel any suffering; but I am persuaded  that you ate sensible of the bodily sufferings merely to appraise them. But, as  for those who are unjustly treating you, and fancying to imprison, not correctly,  the sun of the Gospel, whilst fairly blaming them, I pray that by separating themselves  from those things which they are bringing upon themselves they may be turned to  the good, and may draw you to themselves, and may participate in the light. But  for ourselves, the contrary will not deprive us of the all-luminous ray of John,  who are even now about to read the record, and the renewal of this, thy true theology:  but shortly after (for I will say  <A NAME="page_180"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 180</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.x-Page_180"></A> it, even though it be rash), about to be united to you yourself. For, I am altogether  trustworthy, from having learned, and reading the things made foreknown to you by  God, that you will both be liberated from your imprisonment in Patmos, and will  return to the Asiatic coast, and will perform there imitations of the good God,  and will transmit them to those after you.</p>
