### <span id="iv.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>CAPUT IV.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p1"></span>What is meant by the appellation "Angels?"

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p2"></span>Section I.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p3"></span>Now that the Hierarchy itself has been, in
my judgment, sufficiently defined, we must next extol the Angelic
Hierarchy, and we must contemplate, with supermundane eyes, its sacred
formations, depicted in the Oracles, in order that we may be borne aloft
to their Divinely resplendent simplicity, through the mystic
representations, and may extol the source of all Hierarchical science
with God-becoming reverence and with thanksgivings. First of all,
however, <span id="page_17">p. 17</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iv-Page_17"></span> let this truth be spoken --that it was
through goodness that the superessential Godhead, having fixed all the
essences of things being, brought them into being. For this is the
peculiar characteristic of the Cause of all things, and of goodness
surpassing all, to call things being to participation of Itself, as each
order of things being was determined from its own analogy. For all
things being share in a Providence, which bubbles forth from the
superessential Deity, Cause of all things. For they would not be, unless
they had participated in the Essence and Origin of things being. All
things then, without life, participate in It by their being. For the
being of all things is the Deity, above being; things living participate
in its life-giving power, above all life; things rational and
intellectual participate in its self-perfect and preeminently perfect
wisdom, above all reason and mind. It is evident, then, that all those
Beings are around It, which have participated in It, in many forms.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p4"></span>Section II.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p5"></span>The holy orders, then, of the Heavenly
Beings share in the supremely Divine participation, in a higher degree
than things which merely exist, or which lead an irrational life, or
which are rational like ourselves. For by moulding themselves
intelligibly to the Divine imitation, and looking supermundanely to the
supremely Divine likeness, and striving to mould their intellectual
appearance, they naturally have more ungrudging communications with It,
being near and ever moving upwards, as far as <span id="page_18">p.
18</span> <span id="iv.ii.iv-Page_18"></span>lawful, elevating
themselves with the intensity of the Divine unswerving love, and
receiving the primal illuminations without earthly stain, and ranging
themselves to these, and having their whole life intellectual. These,
then, are they who, at first hand, and under many forms, participate in
the Divine, and, at first hand, and under many forms, make known the
supremely Divine Hiddenness. Wherefore, beyond all, they are deemed
pre-eminently worthy of the appellation Angelic, on the ground that the
supremely Divine illumination comes to them at first hand, and, through
them, there pass to us manifestations above us. Thus, then, the Law, as
the Word of God affirms, was given to us through the ministration of
Angels <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205) ; and Angels led our
illustrious fathers <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206) before the
Law, and after the Law, to the Divine Being, either by leading <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207) them to what was to be done, and by
converting them from error, and an unholy life, to the straight way of
truth <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208) , or by making known to
them sacred ordinances <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209) , or
hidden visions, or supermundane mysteries <span
id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210) , or certain Divine predictions
through the Prophets <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211) .

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p6"></span>Section III.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p7"></span>But if any one should say that Divine
manifestations were made directly and immediately to some holy men <span
id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212) , let him learn, and that distinctly,
from the most Holy Oracles, that no one hath seen, nor <span
id="page_19">p. 19</span> <span id="iv.ii.iv-Page_19"></span>ever shall
see, the "hidden" <span id="iv.ii.iv-p7.3"></span>τὸ κρύφιον of Almighty
God as it is in itself <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213) . Now
Divine manifestations were made to the pious as befits revelations of
God, that is to say, through certain holy visions analogous to those who
see them. Now the all-wise Word of God (Theologia) naturally calls
Theophany that particular vision which manifests the Divine similitude
depicted in itself as in a shaping of the shapeless, from the elevation
of the beholders to the Divine Being, since through it a divine
illumination comes to the beholders, and the divine persons themselves
are religiously initiated into some mystery. But our illustrious fathers
were initiated into these Divine visions, through the mediation of the
Heavenly Powers. Does not the tradition of the Oracles describe the holy
legislation of the Law, given to Moses, as coming straight from God, in
order that it may teach us this truth, that it is an outline of a Divine
and holy legislation? But the Word of God, in its Wisdom, teaches this
also--that it came to us through Angels, as though the Divine regulation
were laying down this rule, that, through the first, the second are
brought to the Divine Being. For not only with regard to the superior
and inferior minds, but even for those of the same rank, this Law has
been established by the superessential supreme ordinance, that, within
each Hierarchy, there are first, and middle, and last ranks and powers,
and that the more divine are instructors <span id="page_20">p. 20</span>
<span id="iv.ii.iv-Page_20"></span> and conductors of the less, to the
Divine access, and illumination, and participation.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p8"></span>Section IV.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p9"></span>But I observe that Angels first were
initiated in the Divine mystery of the love of Jesus towards man, then,
through them, the gift of its knowledge passed to us. Thus, for example,
the most divine Gabriel instructed Zachariah, the Hierarch, that the son
who was to be born to him, beyond hope, by Divine grace, should be a
prophet of the God-incarnate work of the Lord Jesus, to be manifested to
the world for its salvation, as becomes the Divine goodness; and he
revealed to Mary, how, in her, should be born the supremely Divine
mystery of the unutterable God-formation. Yet another Angel instructed
Joseph, how, in very truth, should be fulfilled the things Divinely
promised to his ancestor David. Another declared glad tidings to the
shepherds, as being purified by their separation from the multitude, and
their quiet life, and, with him, a multitude of the Heavenly Host
announced to those on earth that often-sung doxology. Let us then ascend
to the highest manifestations of light contained in the Oracles, for I
perceive that even Jesus Himself, the superessential Cause of the
super-heavenly Beings, when He had come to our condition, without
change, did not overstep the good order which becomes <span
id="page_21">p. 21</span> <span id="iv.ii.iv-Page_21"></span>mankind,
which Himself arranged and took, but readily subjected Himself to the
dispositions of the Father and God, through Angels; and, through their
mediation, was announced to Joseph the departure of the Son to Egypt,
which had been arranged by the Father, and again the return to Judaea
from Egypt. And through Angels we see Him subjecting Himself to the
Father’s decrees. For I forbear to speak, as addressing one who knows
the teaching of our hierarchical tradition, both concerning the Angel
who strengthened the Lord Jesus, or that even Jesus Himself, when He had
come to manifest the good work of our beneficent salvation, was called
Angel of Great Counsel. For, as He Himself says, after the manner of an
Angel, "Whatsoever He heard from the Father, He announced to us."
