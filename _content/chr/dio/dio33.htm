<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-p1"></A><b>LETTER IX. </b> <i>To Titus, Hierarch, asking by letter  what is the house of wisdom, what the bowl, and what are its meats and drinks?</i></p>  
<p align="center"><a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-p2"></A>SECTION I.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-p3"></A>I do not know, O excellent Titus, whether the holy Timothy departed, deaf to  some of the theological symbols which were explained by me. But, in the <i>Symbolic  Theology, </i>we have thoroughly investigated for him all the expressions of the  Oracles concerning God, which appear to the multitude to be monstrous.  <A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-Page_168"></A> For they give a colour of incongruity  dreadful to the uninitiated souls, when the Fathers of the unutterable wisdom explain  the Divine and Mystical Truth, unapproachable by the profane, through certain, certainly  hidden and daring enigmas. Wherefore also, the many discredit the expressions concerning  the Divine Mysteries. For, we contemplate them only through the sensible symbols  that have grown upon them. We must then strip them, and view them by themselves  in their naked purity. For, thus contemplating them, we should reverence a fountain  of Life flowing into Itself--viewing It even standing by Itself, and as a kind  of single power, simple, self-moved, and self-worked, not abandoning Itself, but  a knowledge surpassing every kind of knowledge, and always contemplating Itself,  through Itself. We thought it necessary then, both for him and for others, that  we should, as far as possible, unfold the varied forms of the Divine" representations  of God in symbols. For, with what incredible and simulated monstrosities are its  external, forms filled? For instance, with regard to the superessential Divine generation,  representing a body of God corporally generating God; and describing a word flowing  out into air from a man&#8217;s heart, which eructates it, and a breath, breathed forth  from a mouth; and celebrating God-bearing bosoms embracing a son of God,  bodily; or representing these things after the manner of <A NAME="page_169"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 169</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-Page_169"></A>   plants, and producing certain trees, and branches,  and flowers and roots, as examples; or fountains of waters y, bubbling forth; or  seductive light productions of reflected splendours; or certain other sacred representations  which explain superessential descriptions of God; but with regard to the intelligible  providences of Almighty God, either gifts, manifestations, or powers, or properties,  or repose, or abidings, or progressions, or distinctions, or unions, clothing Almighty  God in human form, and in the varied shape of wild beasts and other living creatures, and plants, and stones; and attributing to Him ornaments of women, or weapons  of savages; and assigning working in clay, and in a furnace, as it were to a sort  of artisan; and placing under Him, horses and chariots and thrones; and spreading  before Him certain dainty meats delicately cooked; and representing Him as drinking,  and drunken, and sleeping, and suffering from excess. What would any one say concerning  the angers, the griefs, the various oaths, the repentances, the curses, the  revenges, the manifold and dubious excuses for the failure of promises, the battle  of giants in Genesis, during which He is said to scheme against those  <A NAME="page_170"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 170</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-Page_170"></A> powerful and great men, and this  when they were contriving the building, not with a view to injustice towards other  people, but on behalf of their own safety? And that counsel devised in heaven to  deceive and mislead Achab&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">133</FONT></A>
; and those mundane and  meritricious passions of the Canticles; and all the other sacred compositions which  appear in the description of God, which stick at nothing, as projections, and multiplications  of hidden things, and divisions of things one and undivided, and formative and manifold  forms of the shapeless and unformed; of which, if any one were able to see their  inner hidden beauty, he will find every one of them mystical and Godlike, and filled  with abundant theological light. For let us not think, that the appearances of the  compositions have been formed for their own sake, but that they shield the science  unutterable and invisible to the multitude, since things all-holy are not within  the reach of the profane, but are manifested to those only who are genuine lovers  of piety, who reject all childish fancy respecting the holy symbols, and are capable  to pass with simplicity of mind, and aptitude of contemplative faculty, to the simple  and supernatural and elevated truth of the symbols. Besides, we must also consider  this, that the teaching, handed down by the Theologians is two-fold--one, secret  and mystical--the other, open and better known--one, symbolical and initiative--the  other, <A NAME="page_171"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 171</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-Page_171"></A> philosophic and demonstrative;--and  the unspoken is intertwined with the spoken. The one persuades, and desiderates  the truth of the things expressed, the other acts and implants in Almighty God,  by instructions in mysteries not learnt by teaching. And certainly, neither our  holy instructors, nor those of the law, abstain from the God-befitting symbols,  throughout the celebrations of the most holy mysteries. Yea, we see even the most  holy Angels, mystically advancing things Divine through enigmas; and Jesus Himself,  speaking the word of God in parables, and transmitting the divinely wrought mysteries,  through a typical spreading of a table. For, it was seemly, not only that the Holy  of holies should be preserved undefiled by the multitude, but also that the Divine  knowledge should illuminate the human life, which is at once indivisible and divisible,  in a manner suitable to itself; and to limit the passionless part of the soul to  the simple, and most inward visions of the most godlike images; but that its impassioned  part should wait upon, and, at the same time, strive after, the most Divine coverings,  through the pre-arranged representations of the typical symbols, as such (coverings)  are, by nature, congenial to it. And all those who are hearers of a distinct theology  without symbols, weave in themselves a sort of type, which conducts them to the  conception of the aforesaid theology. <A NAME="page_172"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 172</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-Page_172"></A></p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-p4"></A>SECTION II.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-p5"></A>But also the very order of the visible universe sets forth the invisible things  of Almighty God, as says both Paul and the infallible Word. Wherefore, also, the  Theologians view some things politically and legally, but other things,  purely and without flaw; and some things humanly, and mediately, but other things  supermundanely and perfectly; at one time indeed, from the laws which are manifest,  and at another, from the institutions which are unmanifest, as befits the holy writings  and minds and souls under consideration. For the whole statement lying before them,  and all its details, does not contain a bare history, but a vivifying perfection.  We must then, in opposition to the vulgar conception concerning them, reverently  enter within the sacred symbols, and not dishonour them, being as they are, products  and moulds of the Divine characteristics, and manifest images of the unutterable  and supernatural visions. For, not only are the superessential lights, and things  intelligible, and, in one word, things Divine, represented in various forms through  the typical symbols, as the superessential God, spoken of as fire, and the intelligible  Oracles of Almighty God, as flames of fire; but further, even the godlike orders  of the angels, both contemplated and <A NAME="page_173"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 173</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-Page_173"></A>   contemplating, are described under varied forms, and manifold likenesses, and empyrean  shapes. And differently must we take the same likeness of fire, when spoken with  regard to the inconceivable God; and differently with regard to His intelligible  providences or words; and differently respecting the Angels. The, one as causal,  but the other as originated, and the third as participative, and different things  differently, as their contemplation, and scientific arrangements suggest.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-p6"></A>And never must we confuse the sacred symbols haphazard, but we must unfold them  suitably to the causes, or the origins, or the powers, or the orders, or the dignities  of which they are explanatory tokens. And, in order that I may not extend my letter  beyond the bounds of propriety, let us come at once to the very question propounded  by you; and we affirm that every nourishment is perfective of those nourished, filling  up their imperfection and their lack, and tending the weak, and guarding their lives,  making to sprout, and renewing and bequeathing to them a vivifying wellbeing; and  in one word, urging the slackening and imperfect, and contributing towards their  comfort and perfection.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-p7"></A>SECTION III.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-p8"></A>Beautifully then, the super-wise and Good Wisdom is celebrated by the Oracles,  as placing a mystical bowl, and pouring forth its sacred drink, but first  <A NAME="page_174"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 174</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-Page_174"></A> setting forth the solid meats, and  with a loud voice Itself benignly soliciting those who seek It. The Divine Wisdom,  then, sets forth the two-fold food; one indeed, solid and fixed, but the other liquid  and flowing forth; and in a bowl furnishes Its own providential generosities. Now  the bowl, being spherical and open, let it be a symbol of the Providence over the  whole, which at once expands Itself and encircles all, without beginning and without  end. But since, even while going forth to all, It remains in Itself, and stands  fixed in unmoved sameness; and never departing from Itself, the bowl also itself  stands fixedly and unmovably. But Wisdom is also said to build a house for itself,  and in it to set forth the solid meats and drinks, and the bowl, so that it may  be evident to those who understand things Divine in a manner becoming God, that  the Author of the being, and of the well being, of all things, is both an all-perfect  providence, and advances to all, and comes into being in everything, and embraces  them all; and on the other hand, He, the same, in the same, <i>par excellence, </i>is nothing in anything at all, but overtops the whole, Himself being in Himself,  identically and always; and standing, and remaining, and resting, and ever being  in the same condition and in the same way, and never becoming outside Himself, nor  falling from His own session, and unmoved abiding, and shrine,--yea even, in it,  benevolently <A NAME="page_175"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 175</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-Page_175"></A> exercising His complete  and all-perfect providences, and whilst going forth to all, remaining by Himself  alone, and standing always, and moving Himself; and neither standing, nor moving  Himself, but, as one might say, both connaturally and supernaturally, having His  providential energies, in His steadfastness, and His steadiness in His Providence.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-p9"></A>SECTION IV.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-p10"></A>But what is the solid food and what the liquid? For the Good Wisdom is celebrated  as at once bestowing and providing these. I suppose then, that the solid food is  suggestive of the intellectual and abiding perfection and sameness, within which,  things Divine are participated as a stable, and strong, and unifying, and indivisible  knowledge, by those contemplating organs of sense, by which the most Divine Paul,  after partaking of wisdom, imparts his really solid nourishment; but that the liquid  is suggestive of the stream, at once flowing through and to all; eager to advance,  and further conducting those who are properly nourished as to goodness, through  things variegated and many and divided, to the simple and invariable knowledge of  God. Wherefore the divine and spiritually perceived Oracles are likened to dew,  and water, and to milk, and wine, and honey; on account of their life-producing  power, as in water; and growth-giving, as in milk; and reviving, as in wine; and  both purifying and preserving, as in honey. For these things, the Divine Wisdom  gives to those approaching it, and furnishes <A NAME="page_176"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 176</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-Page_176"></A>   and fills to overflowing, a stream of ungrudging and unfailing good cheer. This,  then, is the veritable good cheer; and, on this account, it is celebrated, as at  once life-giving and nourishing and perfecting.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-p11"></A>SECTION V.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-p12"></A>According to this sacred explanation of good cheer, even Almighty God, Himself  the Author of all good things, is said to be inebriated, by reason of the super-full,  and beyond conception, and ineffable, immeasurableness, of the good cheer, or to  speak more properly, good condition of Almighty God. For, as regards us, in the  worst sense, drunkenness is both an immoderate repletion, and being out of mind  and wits; so, in the best sense, respecting God, we ought not to imagine drunkenness  as anything else beyond the super-full immeasurableness of all good things pre-existing  in Him as Cause. But, even in respect to being out of wits, which follows upon drunkenness,  we must consider the pre-eminence of Almighty God, which is above conception, in  which He overtops our conception, as being above conception and above being conceived,  and above being itself; and in short, Almighty God is inebriated with, and outside  of, all good things whatever, as being at once a super-full hyperbole of every immeasurableness  of them all; and again, as dwelling outside and beyond the whole. Starting then  from these, we will take in the same fashion even the feasting of the pious, in  the Kingdom of Almighty God. For He says, the King Himself <A NAME="page_177"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 177</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-Page_177"></A>  will come and make them recline, and will Himself  minister to them. Now these things manifest a common and concordant communion of  the holy, upon the good things of God, and a church of the first born, whose names are  written in heavens; and spirits of just men made perfect by all good things, and  replete with all good things; and the reclining, we imagine, a cessation from their  many labours, and a life without pain; and a godly citizenship in light and place  of living souls, replete with every holy bliss, and an ungrudging provision of every  sort of blessed goods; within which they are filled with every delight; whilst Jesus  both makes them recline, and ministers to them, and furnishes this delight; and  Himself bequeaths their everlasting rest; and at once distributes and pours forth  the fulness of good things.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-p13"></A>SECTION VI.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-p14"></A>But, I well know you will further ask that the propitious sleep of Almighty God,  and His awakening, should be explained. And, when we have said, that the superiority  of Almighty God, and His incommunicability with the objects of His Providence is  a Divine sleep, and that the attention to His Providential cares of those who need  His discipline, or His preservation, is an awakening, you will pass to other symbols  of the Word of God. Wherefore, thinking it superfluous that by running  <A NAME="page_178"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 178</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.ii.ix-Page_178"></A> through the same things to the same.  persons, we should seem to say different things, and, at the same time, conscious  that you assent to things that are good, we finish this letter at what we have said,  having set forth, as I think, more than the things solicited in your letters. Further,  we send the whole of our <i>Symbolical Theology, </i>within which you will find,  together with the house of wisdom, also the seven pillars investigated, and its  solid food divided into sacrifices and breads. And what is the mingling of the wine;  and again, What is the sickness arising from the inebriety of Almighty God? and  in fact, the things now spoken of are explained in it more explicitly. And it is,  in my judgment, a correct enquiry into all the symbols of the Word of God, and agreeable  to the sacred traditions and truths of the Oracles.</p>
