<p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p1"></A>Concerning Being--in which also concerning Exemplars.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p2"></A>SECTION I.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p3"></A>LET us now then pass to the name "Being"--given in the Oracles as veritably that  of Him, Who veritably is. But we will recall to your remembrance this much, that  the purpose of our treatise is not to make known the superessential Essence--<i>qua </i>superessential--(for this is inexpressible, and unknowable, and altogether unrevealed,  and surpassing the union itself), but to celebrate the progression of the supremely  Divine Source of Essence, which gives essence to all things being. For the Divine  Name of the Good, as making known the whole progressions of the Cause of all, is  extended, both to things being, and things not being, and is above things being,  and things not being. But the Name of Being is extended to all things being, and  is above things being;--and the Name of Life is extended to all things living, and  is above things living; and the Name of Wisdom is extended to all the intellectual  and rational and sensible, and is above all these.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p4"></A>SECTION II.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p5"></A>The treatise, then, seeks to celebrate these, the Names of God, which set forth  His Providence. For it does not profess to express the very superessential Goodness,  and Essence, and Life, and  <A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ii.ii.v-Page_74"></A> Wisdom, of the very superessential Deity, Which is seated above all  Goodness, and Deity, and Essence, and Wisdom, and Life,--in secret places, as the  Oracles affirm. But it celebrates the beneficial Providence, which has been set  forth as preeminently Goodness and Cause of all good things, and as Being, and Life,  and Wisdom,--the Cause essentiating and vivifying, and wise-making, of those who  partake of essence, and life, and mind, and reason, and sense. But it does not affirm  that the Good is one thing, and the Being another; and that Life is other than Wisdom;  nor that the Causes are many, and that some deities produce one thing and others  another, as superior and inferior; but that the whole good progressions and the  Names of God, celebrated by us, are of one God; and that the one epithet makes known  the complete Providence of the one God, but that the others are indicative of His  more general and more particular providences.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p6"></A>SECTION III.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p7"></A>Yet, some one might say, for what reason do we affirm that Life is superior to  Being, and Wisdom to Life? Things with life no doubt are above things that merely  exist--things sensible above those which merely live,--and things rational above these,--and  the Minds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">44</FONT></A>
 above the rational, and are around God, and are more  near to Him. Yet, things which partake of greater gifts from God, must needs be  <A NAME="page_75"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 75</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ii.ii.v-Page_75"></A> better and superior to the rest. But if any one assumed the intellectual  to be without being, and without life, the statement might hold good. But if the  Divine Minds are both above all the rest of beings, and live above the other living  beings, and think and know, above sensible perception and reason, and, beyond all  the other existing beings, aspire to, and participate in, the Beautiful and Good,  they are more around the Good, participating in It more abundantly, and having received  larger and greater gifts from It. As also, the rational creatures excel those of  sensible perception, by their superiority in the abundance of reason, and these,  by their sensible perception, and others, by their life. And this, as I think, is  true, that the things which participate more in the One and boundless-giving God,  are more near to Him, and more divine, than those who come behind them (in gifts).</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p8"></A>SECTION IV.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p9"></A>Now, since we are speaking of these things, come then, and let us praise the  Good, as veritably Being, and giving essence to all things that be. He, Who is,  is superessential, sustaining Cause of the whole potential Being, and Creator of  being, existence, subsistence, essence, nature; Source and Measure of ages, and  Framer of times, and Age of things that be, Time of things coming into being, Being  of things howsoever being, Birth of things howsoever born. From Him, Who is, is  age, and essence, and being, and time, and birth, and thing born; the realities  <A NAME="page_76"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 76</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ii.ii.v-Page_76"></A> in things that be, and things howsoever existing and subsisting. For  Almighty God is not relatively a Being, but absolutely and unboundedly, having comprehended  and anticipated the whole Being in Himself. Wherefore, He is also called King of  the ages, since the whole being both is, and is sustained, in Him and around Him.  And He neither was, nor will be, nor became, nor becomes, nor will become--yea rather,  neither is. But He is the Being to things that be, and not things that be only,  but the very being of things that be, absolutely from before the ages. For He is  the Age of ages--the Existing before the ages.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p10"></A>SECTION V.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p11"></A>Summing up, then, let us say, that the being to all beings and to the ages, is  from the Preexisting. And every age and time is from Him. And of every age and time,  and of everything, howsoever existing, the Pre-existing is Source and Cause. And  all things participate in Him, and from no single existing thing does He stand aloof.  And He is before all things, and all things in Him consist. And absolutely, if anything  is, in any way whatsoever, it both is, and is contemplated, and is preserved in  the Pre-existing. And, before all the other participations in Him, the being is  pre-supposed. And self-existent Being has precedence of the being self-existent  Life; and the being self-existent Wisdom; and the being self-existent Divine Likeness;  and the other beings, in whatever gifts  <A NAME="page_77"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 77</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ii.ii.v-Page_77"></A> participating, before all these participate in being; yea, rather,  all self-existent things, of which existing things participate, participate in the  self-existent Being. And there is nothing existent, of which the self-existent Being  is not essence and age. Naturally, then, more chiefly than all the rest, Almighty  God is celebrated as Being, from the prior of His other gifts; for pre-possessing  even pre-existence, and super-existence, and super-possessing being, He pre-established  all being, I mean self-existent being; and subjected everything, howsoever existing,  to Being Itself. And then, all the sources of beings, as participating in being,  both are, and are sources, and first are, and then are sources. And, if you wish  to say, that the self-existent Life is source of living things, as living; and the  self-existent Similitude, of things similar as similar; and the self-existent Union,  of things united, as united; and the self-existent Order, of things ordered, as  ordered and of the rest, as many as, by participating in this or that, or both,  or many, are this or that, or both, or many, you will find the self-existent participations  themselves, first participating in being, and by their being, first remaining;--then  being sources of this or that, and by their participating in being, both being,  and being participated. But, if these <i>are </i>by their participation of being,  much more the things participating in them.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p12"></A>SECTION VI.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p13"></A>The self-existent Super-goodness then, as projecting the first gift of self-existent  being, is  <A NAME="page_78"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 78</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ii.ii.v-Page_78"></A> celebrated by the elder and first of the participations; and being  itself is from It, and in It; as also the sources of things being, and all the things  that be, and the things howsoever sustained by being, and that irresistibly, and  comprehensively and uniformly. For even in a monad, every number preexists in the  form of a unit, and the monad holds every number in itself singly. And every number  is united in the monad, but so far as it advances from the monad, so far it is distributed  and multiplied. And in a centre, all the lines&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A>
 of the  circle coexist within one union, and the point holds all the straight lines in itself,  uniformly united, both to each other, and to the one source from which they proceeded,  and in the centre itself they are completely united; but standing slightly distant  from it, they are slightly separated; but when more apart, more so. And in one word,  the nearer they are to the centre, the more they are united to it and to each other?  and the more they stand apart from it, the more they stand apart from each other.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p14"></A>SECTION VII.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p15"></A>But all the proportions of nature individually are comprehended in the whole  nature of the whole, within one unconfused union; and in the soul, the powers of  each several part are provident of the whole body in a uniform fashion. There is  nothing out of place then, that, by ascending from obscure images to the Cause of  all, we should  <A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ii.ii.v-Page_79"></A> contemplate, with supermundane eyes, all things in the Cause of all,  even those contrary to each other, after a single fashion and unitedly. For It is  Source of things existing, from which are both being itself, and all things however  being; every source, every term, every life, every immortality, every wisdom, every  order, every harmony, every power, every protection, every stability, every endurance,  every conception, every word, every sensible perception, every habit, every standing,  every movement, every union, every mingling, every friendship, every agreement,  every difference, every limit, and whatever other things existing by being, characterize  all things being.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p16"></A>SECTION VIII.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p17"></A>And from the same Cause of all, are the higher and lower intellectual&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A>
  essences of the godlike angels; and those of the souls; and the natures of the whole  Cosmos; all things whatsoever said to be either in others, or by reflection. Yea,  even the all holy and most honoured Powers veritably being, and established, as  it were, in the vestibule of the superessential Triad, are from It, and in It;  and have the being and the godlike being; and after them, as regards Angels, the  subordinate, subordinately, and the remotest, most remotely, but as regards ourselves,  supermundanely. And the souls, and all the other beings, according to the same rule,  have their being, and their well-being; and are, and are well; by having from the  Pre-existing their being  <A NAME="page_80"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 80</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ii.ii.v-Page_80"></A> and their well-being. And in It are both being and well-being; and  from It, beginning; and in It, guarded; and to It, terminated. And the prerogatives  of being he distributes to the superior beings, which the Oracles call even eternal.  But being itself never at any time fails all existing beings. And even self-existent  being is from the Pre-existent, and of Him is being, and He is not of being;--and  in Him is being, and He is not in being; and being possesses Him, and not He possesses  being; and He is both age and beginning, and measure of being; being essentiating  Source, and Middle and End, of pre-essence, and being and age and all things. And  for this reason, by the Oracles, the veritably Pre-existing is represented under  many forms, according to every conception of beings, and the "Was" and the "Is,"  and the "Will be," and the "Became," and the "Becomes," and the "Will become," are  properly sung respecting Him. For all these, to those who think worthily of God,  signify by every conception His being superessentially, and Cause in every way of  things existing. For He is not this, but not that; nor is He in some way, but not  in some other; but He is all things, as Cause of all, and containing and pre-holding  in Himself all governments, all controls, of all existing things. And He is above  all, as superessentially super-being before all. Wherefore, also, all things are  predicated of Him and together, and He is none of them all; of every shape, of every  kind, without form, without beauty, anticipating in Himself, beginnings and middles,  <A NAME="page_81"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 81</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ii.ii.v-Page_81"></A> and ends of things existing, irresistibly and preeminently; and shedding  forth without flaw, (the light of) being to all, as beseems a One and super-united  Cause. For, if our sun, at the same time that he is one and sheds a uniform light,  renews the essences and qualities of sensible creatures, although they are many  and various, and nourishes and guards, and perfects and distinguishes, and unites,  and fosters, and makes to be productive, and increases, and transforms, and establishes,  and makes to grow, and awakens, and gives life to all; and each of the whole, in  a manner appropriate to itself, participates in the same and one sun; and the one  sun anticipated in himself, uniformly, the causes of the many participants; much  more with regard to the Cause of it and of all things, ought we to concede that  It first presides over, as beseems One superessential Oneness, all the exemplars,  of things existing; since He produces even essences, as beseems the egression from  essence. But, we affirm that the exemplars are the methods in God, giving essence  to things that be, and pre-existing uniformly, which theology calls predeterminations,  and Divine and good wills, which define and produce things existing; according to  which (predeterminations) the Superessential both predetermined and brought into  existence everything that exists.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p18"></A>SECTION IX.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p19"></A>But, if the Philosopher Clemens thinks good, that the higher amongst beings should  be called  <A NAME="page_82"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 82</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ii.ii.v-Page_82"></A> exemplars in relation to something, his statement advances, not through  correct and perfect and simple names. But, when we have conceded even this, to be  correctly said, we must call to mind the Word of God, which says, "I have not shewn  thee these things for the purpose of going after them, but that through the proportionate  knowledge of these we may be led up to the Cause of all, as we are capable."</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p20"></A>We must attribute, then, all existing things to It, as beseems One Union pre-eminent  above all, since by starting from Being, the essentiating Progression and Goodness,  both penetrating all, and filling all things with Its own being, and rejoicing over  all things being, pre-holds all things in Itself, rejecting all duplicity by an  one superfluity of simplicity. But It grasps all things in the same way, as beseems  its super-simplified Infinity, and is participated in by all uniquely, even as a  voice, whilst being one and the same, is participated in by many ears as one.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p21"></A>SECTION X.</p> 
<p><a name="ii.ii.ii.v-p22"></A>The Pre-existing then is beginning and end of existing things; beginning indeed  as Cause, and end as for whom; and term of all, and infinitude of all infinitude;  and term, especially, of things that are, as it were, opposed. For in One, as we  have often said, He both pre-holds and sustains all existing things, being present  to all, and everywhere, both as regards the one, and the same, and as the every  same, and issuing forth to all, and abiding in Himself; and standing and moving,  and neither standing nor  <A NAME="page_83"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 83</FONT></A> <a name="ii.ii.ii.v-Page_83"></A> moving; neither having beginning, or middle, or end; neither in any  of the existing things, nor being any of the existing things. And neither does any  of the things eternally existing, or those temporarily subsisting, entirely come  up to Him, but He towers above time and eternity, and all things eternal and temporal.  Wherefore also, He is Eternity itself, and things existing, and the measures of  things existing, and things measured through Him and from Him. But let us speak  of these things more opportunely on another occasion.</p>
