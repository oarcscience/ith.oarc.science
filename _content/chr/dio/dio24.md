## <span id="ii.iv.i-p0.1"></span>PREFACE TO THE LETTERS OF DIONYSIUS THE AREOPAGITE.

<span id="ii.iv.i-p1"></span>THESE Letters attest the existence of the
writings, and the wisdom spoken among the perfect, in the Apostolic
Age.--To Gaius, who is commemorated by St. John and St. Paul, we owe the
explanation of *Agnosia*, and valued teaching on the Personality of our
Lord; to Dorotheus we are indebted for a fuller explanation of the
Divine Gloom; to Sosipater, twice mentioned in the Acts and Romans, we
owe the wisest letter ever penned for the instruction of the Christian
Apologist and Missionary. The Letter to Polycarp touches on those
mysterious signs in the heavens, by which Almighty God shewed His
universal power. Dionysius shews his reverence for God’s holy word, by
never seeking to explain away, or to substitute what seems a less
miracle for a greater. The trifold Mithra commemorated amongst the
Babylonians shews that Hezekiah’s sign was not merely visible and
observed in Judea. The King, as High Priest of his people, was already
robed for evening prayer, when he observed the sun gone back; and one
day became almost three, i.e. thirty-two hours instead of thirty-six.
Dionysius describes the darkness at the time of the Crucifixion, as it
<span id="page_p140">p. p140</span> <span id="ii.iv.i-Page_p140"></span>
appeared in Egypt, and is recorded by Phlegon. We do not explain and
interpret the facts recorded in the Gospel, by denying them, or by
treating the same testimony outside the Gospel as superstitious.

<span id="ii.iv.i-p2"></span>To Demophilus, we owe a knowledge of
Church-law and order, which teaches the Christian duty of being "sent,"
and which should teach clergy to obey their Bishop, and not merely the
Act of uniformity. To Titus, we owe the preservation of the sum of the
*Symbolic Theology.* From the letter to St. John in Patmos, we learn the
love between St. John arid Dionysius, and that St. John was then Called
the "Sun of the Gospel." From the letter to Apollophanes, we know that
the prayers of Dionysius for the conversion of his friend did not fall
to the ground. Apollophanes was tutor to Polemon, who again was tutor to
Aristides, who presented his "Apology" to the Emperor Hadrian. The
conversion of Statonice, the wife of Apollophanes, was the cause of St.
Paul’s being cast into chains at Philippi, where the messengers from
Corinth found him, through whom he sent the Epistle recently brought to
light <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60) .

*Circumcision,* 1897.
