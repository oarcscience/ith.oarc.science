The Works of Dionysius the Areopagite, tr. by John Parker, \[1897\], at

<span id="ii.iv.ii.ii"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.ii.ii-p1"></span>**LETTER II.** *To the same Gaius
Therapeutes.*

<span id="ii.iv.ii.ii-p2"></span>How is He, Who is beyond all <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62) , both above source of Divinity and above
source of Good? Provided you <span id="page_142">p. 142</span> <span
id="ii.iv.ii.ii-Page_142"></span> understand Deity and Goodness, as the
very Actuality of the Good-making and God-making gift, and the
inimitable imitation of the super-divine and super-good (gift), by aid
of which we are deified and made good. For, moreover, if this becomes
source of the deification and making good of those who are being deified
and made good, He,--Who is super-source of every source, even of the
so-called Deity and Goodness, seeing He is beyond source of Divinity and
source of Goodness, in so far as He is inimitable, and not to be
retained--excels the imitations and retentions, and the things which are
imitated and those participating.
