<span id="ii.iv.ii.v-p1"></span>**LETTER V.** *To Dorotheus,
Leitourgos.*

<span id="ii.iv.ii.v-p2"></span>The Divine gloom is the unapproachable
light in which God is said to dwell <span id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65)
. And in this gloom, invisible <span id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66)
indeed, on account of the surpassing brightness, and unapproachable on
account of the excess of the superessential stream of light, enters
every one deemed worthy to know and to see God, by the very fact of
neither seeing nor knowing, really entering in Him, Who is above vision
and knowledge, knowing this very thing, that He is after all the object
of sensible and intelligent perception, and saying in the words of the
Prophet, "Thy knowledge was regarded as wonderful by me; It was
confirmed; I can by no means attain unto it <span
id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67) ;" even as the Divine Paul is said to
have known Almighty God, by having known Him as being above all
conception and knowledge. Wherefore also, he says, "His ways are past
finding out <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68) and His Judgements
inscrutable," and His gifts "indescribable <span
id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69) ," and that His peace surpasses every
mind <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70) , as having found Him Who is
above all, and having known this which is above conception, that, by
being Cause of all, He is beyond all.
