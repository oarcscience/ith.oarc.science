<span id="ii.iv.ii.x-p1"></span>**LETTER X.** *To John, Theologos,
Apostle and Evangelist, imprisoned in the Isle of Patmos.*

<span id="ii.iv.ii.x-p2"></span>I salute thee, the holy soul! O beloved
one! and this for me is more appropriate than for most. Hail! O truly
beloved! And to the truly Loveable and Desired, very beloved! Why should
it be a marvel, if Christ speaks truly, and the unjust banish His
disciples from their cities <span id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133) ,
themselves bringing upon themselves their due, and the accursed severing
themselves, and departing from the holy. Truly <span id="page_179">p.
179</span> <span id="ii.iv.ii.x-Page_179"></span> things seen are
manifest images of things unseen. For, neither in the ages which are
approaching, will Almighty God be Cause of the just separations from
Himself, but they by having separated themselves entirely from Almighty
God; even as we observe the others, becoming here already with Almighty
God, since being lovers of truth, they depart from the proclivities of
things material, and love peace in a complete freedom from all things
evil, and a Divine love of all things good; and start their
purification, even from the present life, by living, in the midst of
mankind, the life which is to come, in a manner suitable to angels, with
complete cessation of passion, and deification and goodness, and the
other good attributes. As for you then, I would never be so crazy as to
imagine that you feel any suffering; but I am persuaded that you ate
sensible of the bodily sufferings merely to appraise them. But, as for
those who are unjustly treating you, and fancying to imprison, not
correctly, the sun of the Gospel, whilst fairly blaming them, I pray
that by separating themselves from those things which they are bringing
upon themselves they may be turned to the good, and may draw you to
themselves, and may participate in the light. But for ourselves, the
contrary will not deprive us of the all-luminous ray of John, who are
even now about to read the record, and the renewal of this, thy true
theology: but shortly after (for I will say <span id="page_180">p.
180</span> <span id="ii.iv.ii.x-Page_180"></span> it, even though it be
rash), about to be united to you yourself. For, I am altogether
trustworthy, from having learned, and reading the things made foreknown
to you by God, that you will both be liberated from your imprisonment in
Patmos, and will return to the Asiatic coast, and will perform there
imitations of the good God, and will transmit them to those after you.
