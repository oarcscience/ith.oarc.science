<p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.i-p1"></A>To my Fellow Presbyter Timothy. Dionysius the Presbyter.</p> 
<p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.i-p2"></A>What is the traditional view of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy  and what is its purpose?</p>  
<p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.i-p3"></A>Section I.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.i-p4"></A>We must, then, most pious of pious sons, demonstrate from the supermundane and  most sacred Oracles and traditions, that ours is a Hierarchy of the inspired and  Divine and Deifying science, and of operation, and of consecration, for those who  have been initiated with the initiation of the sacred revelation derived from the  hierarchical mysteries. See, however, that you do not put to scorn things most holy  (Holy of Holies); but rather treat them reverently, and you will honour the things  of the hidden God by intellectual and obscure researches, carefully guarding them  from the participation and defilement of the uninitiated, and reverently sharing  holy things with the holy alone, by a holy enlightenment. For thus, as the Word  of God has taught us who feast at His Banquet, even Jesus Himself--the most supremely  Divine  <A NAME="page_68"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 68</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.i-Page_68"></A> Mind and superessential, the Source and  Essence, and most supremely Divine Power of every Hierarchy and Sanctification and  Divine operation--illuminates the blessed Beings who are superior to us, in a  manner more clear, and at the same time more intellectual, and assimilates them  to His own Light, as far as possible; and by our love of things beautiful elevated  to Him, and which elevates us, folds together our many diversities, and after perfecting  into a uniform and Divine life and habit and operation, holily bequeaths the power  of the Divine Priesthood; from which by approaching to the holy exercise of the  priestly office, we ourselves become nearer to the Beings above us, by assimilation,  according to our power, to their abiding and: unchangeable holy steadfastness; and  thus by looking upwards to the blessed and supremely Divine self of Jesus,  and reverently gazing upon whatever. we are permitted to see, and illuminated with  the knowledge of the visions, we shall be able to become, as regards the science  of Divine mysteries, purified and purifiers; images of Light, and workers, with  God, perfected and perfecting.</p>  
<p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.i-p5"></A>Section II.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.i-p6"></A>Then what is the Hierarchy of the Angels&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">225</FONT></A>
 and Archangels,  and of supermundane Principalities and Authorities, Powers and Lordships, and Divine  Thrones, or of the Beings of the same ranks as the Thrones--which the Word of  God declares to  <A NAME="page_69"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 69</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.i-Page_69"></A>be near, and always about  God, and with&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_225"><FONT SIZE="1">226</FONT></A>
 God, naming them in the Hebrew tongue  Cherubim and Seraphim--by pondering the sacred ranks and divisions of their Orders  and Hierarchies, you will find in the books we have written--not as befits their  dignity but to the best of our ability--and as the Theology of the most holy Scriptures  guided, when they extolled their Hierarchy. Nevertheless, it is necessary to say  this, that both that, and every Hierarchy extolled now by us, has one and the same  power, throughout the whole Hierarchical transaction; and that the Hierarch himself,  according to his essence, and analogy, and rank, is initiated in Divine things,  and is deified and imparts to the subordinates, according to the meetness of each  for the sacred deification which comes to him from God; also that the subordinates  follow the superior, and elevate the inferior towards things in advance; and that  some go before, and, as far as possible, give the lead to others; and that each,  as far as may be, participates in the truly Beautiful, and Wise, and Good, through  this the inspired and sacerdotal harmony.</p> 
<p><a name="iv.iii.i-p7"></A>But the Beings and ranks above us, of whom we have already made a reverent mention,  are both incorporeal, and their Hierarchy is both intelligible and supermundane;  but let us view our Hierarchy, comformably to ourselves, abounding in the variety  of the sensible symbols, by which, in proportion to our capacity, we are conducted,  hierarchically  <A NAME="page_70"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 70</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.i-Page_70"></A>according to our measure, to the uniform  deification --God and Divine virtue. They indeed, as minds, think, according to  laws laid down for themselves; but we are led by sensible figures to the Divine  contemplations, as is possible to us. And, to speak truly, there is One, to Whom  all the Godlike aspire, but they do not partake uniformly of this One and the Same,  but as the Divine balance distributes to each the meet inheritance. Now these things  have been treated more systematically in the Treatise concerning "Intelligible and  Sensible&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_226"><FONT SIZE="1">227</FONT></A>
." But now I will attempt to describe our  Hierarchy, both its source and essence, as best I can; invoking Jesus, the source  and Perfecting of all Hierarchies.</p>  
<p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.i-p8"></A>Section III.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.i-p9"></A>Every Hierarchy, then, is, according to our august tradition, the whole account  of the sacred things falling under it, a most complete summary of the sacred rites  of this or that Hierarchy, as the case may be. Our Hierarchy, then, is called, and  is, the comprehensive system of the whole sacred rites included within it, according  to which the divine Hierarch, being initiated, will have the communication of all  the most sacred things within himself, as chief of Hierarchy. For as he who speaks  of Hierarchy speaks of the order of the whole sacred rites collectively, so he,  who mentions Hierarch, denotes the inspired and godly man--the skilled in all  sacred knowledge--in whom the whole  <A NAME="page_71"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 71</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.i-Page_71"></A>Hierarchy is clearly completed and recognized within himself.</p> 
<p><a name="iv.iii.i-p10"></A>Head of this Hierarchy is the Fountain of Life, the Essence of Goodness, the  one Triad, Cause of things that be, from Which both being and well-being come to  things that be, by reason of goodness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_227"></A><A HREF="#fn_227"><FONT SIZE="1">228</FONT></A>
. Of this most  supremely Divine blessedness --exalted beyond all, the threefold Monad, the really  Being,--the Will, inscrutable to us, but known to Itself, is the rational preservation  of beings amongst us and above us; but that (preservation) cannot otherwise take  place, except those who are, being saved are being deified. Now the assimilation  to, and union with, God, as far as attainable, is deification. And this is the common  goal of every Hierarchy,--the clinging love towards God and Divine things divinely  and uniformly ministered; and previous to this, the complete and unswerving removal  of things contrary, the knowledge of things as they are in themselves; the vision  and science of sacred truth; the inspired communication of the uniform perfection  of the One Itself, as far as attainable; the banquet of contemplation, nourishing  intelligibly, and deifying every man elevated towards it.</p>  
<p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.i-p11"></A>Section IV.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.i-p12"></A>Let us affirm, then, that the supremely Divine Blessedness, the essential Deity, the Source of  <A NAME="page_72"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 72</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.i-Page_72"></A>deification, from Which comes the deification  of those deified, bequeathed, by Divine Goodness, the Hierarchy, for preservation,  and deification of all rational and intellectual Beings. And to the supermundane  and blessed inheritances there is bequeathed something more immaterial and intellectual  (for Almighty God does not move them to things divine, from without, but intelligibly,  since they are illuminated as to the most Divine will from within, with brilliancy  pure and immaterial), but to us--that which has been bequeathed to them, uniformly,  and enveloped, is bequeathed from the Divinely transmitted Oracles, in a variety  and multitude of divisible symbols, as we are able to receive it. For the Divinely  transmitted Oracles are essence of our Hierarchy. And we affirm that these Oracles--all  such as were given from our godly initiators in inspired Letters of the Word of  God --are most august; and further, whatever our leaders have revealed to us from  the same holy men, by a less material initiation, and already akin, as it were,  to the Heavenly Hierarchy, from mind to mind, through the medium of speech, corporeal,  indeed, but nevertheless more immaterial, without writing. Nor did the inspired  Hierarchs transmit these things, in conceptions clear to the commonalty of worshippers,  but in sacred symbols. For it is not every one that is hallowed; nor, as the Oracles  affirm, does knowledge belong to all.  <A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.i-Page_73"></A></p>  
<p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.i-p13"></A>Section V.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.i-p14"></A>Necessarily, then, the first leaders of our Hierarchy, after having been filled  themselves with the sacred gift, from the superessential Godhead, and sent, by the  supremely Divine Goodness, to extend the same gift successively, and, as godly,  earnestly desiring themselves the elevation and deification of those after them,  presented to us--by their written and unwritten revelations--in accordance with  their sacred injunctions, things supercelestial, by sensible images, the enfolded,  by variety and multitude, and things Divine, by things human, and things immaterial,  by things material, and the superessential, by things belonging to us. Nor did they  do this merely on account of the unhallowed, to whom it is not permitted even to  touch the symbols, but because our Hierarchy is, as I said, a kind of symbol adapted  to our condition, which needs things sensible, for our more Divine elevation from  these to things intelligible. Nevertheless the reasons of the symbols have been  revealed to the Divine initiators, which it is not permitted to explain to those  who are yet being initiated, knowing that the Lawgivers of things divinely transmitted  deliberately arranged the Hierarchy in well-established and unconfused ranks, and  in proportionate and sacred distributions of that which was convenient to each,  according to fitness. Wherefore trusting in thy sacred promises (for it is a pious  duty to recall them to thy recollection) -- that, since every Hierarchical sacred  word is of binding  <A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.i-Page_74"></A> force, thou wilt not communicate to any  other but those Godlike initiators of the same rank with thyself, and wilt persuade  them to promise, according to hierarchical regulation, to touch pure things purely,  and to communicate the mysteries of God to the godly alone, and things perfect to  those capable of perfection, and things altogether most holy to the holy, I have  entrusted this Divine gift to thee, in addition to many other Hierarchical gifts.</p>
