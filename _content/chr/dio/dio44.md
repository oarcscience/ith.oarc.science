### <span id="iv.ii-p0.1"></span>DIONYSIUS THE AREOPAGITE

## <span id="iv.ii-p0.2"></span>ON THE HEAVENLY HIERARCHY.

<span id="iv.ii.i"></span>

### <span id="iv.ii.i-p0.1"></span>CAPUT I.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p1"></span>To my Fellow Presbyter Timothy. <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150) Dionysius the Presbyter.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p2"></span>That every divine illumination, whilst
going forth lovingly to the objects of its forethought under various
forms, remains simplex. Nor is this all. It also unifies the things
illuminated.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p3"></span>Section I.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p4"></span>"Every good gift <span
id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151) and every perfect gift is from above,
and cometh down from the Father of Lights."

<span id="iv.ii.i-p5"></span>Further also, every procession of
illuminating light, proceeding from the Father, whilst visiting us as a
gift of goodness, restores us again gradually as an unifying power, and
turns us to the oneness of our conducting Father, and to a deifying
simplicity. For <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152) all things are
from Him, and to Him, as said the Sacred Word.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p6"></span>Section II.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p7"></span>Invoking then Jesus, the Paternal Light,
the Real, the True, "which lighteth <span
id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153) every man coming into <span
id="page_2">p. 2</span> <span id="iv.ii.i-Page_2"></span>the world,"
"through <span id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154) Whom we have access to
the Father," Source of Light, let us aspire, as far as is attainable, to
the illuminations handed down by our fathers in the most sacred Oracles,
and let us gaze, as we may, upon the Hierarchies of the Heavenly Minds
manifested by them symbolically for our instruction. And when we have
received, with immaterial and unflinching mental <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155) eyes, the gift of Light, primal and
super-primal, of the supremely Divine Father, which manifests to us the
most blessed Hierarchies of the Angels in types and symbols, let us
then, from it, be elevated to its simple splendour <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156) . For it *never* loses its own unique
inwardness, but multiplied and going forth, as becomes its goodness, for
an elevating and unifying blending of the objects of its care, remains
firmly and solitarily centred within itself in its unmoved sameness; and
raises, according to their capacity, those who lawfully aspire to it,
and makes them one, after the example of its own unifying Oneness. For
it is not possible that the supremely Divine Ray should otherwise
illuminate us, except so far as it is enveloped, for the purpose of
instruction, in variegated sacred veils, and arranged naturally and
appropriately, for such as we are, by paternal forethought.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p8"></span>Section III.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p9"></span>Wherefore, the Divine Institution of sacred
Rites, having deemed it worthy of the supermundane <span id="page_3">p.
3</span> <span id="iv.ii.i-Page_3"></span> imitation of the Heavenly
Hierarchies, and having depicted the aforesaid immaterial Hierarchies in
material figures and bodily compositions, in order that we might be
borne, as far as our capacity permits, from the most sacred pictures to
the instructions and similitudes without symbol and without type,
transmitted to us our most Holy Hierarchy. For it is not possible for
our mind to be raised to that immaterial representation and
contemplation of the Heavenly Hierarchies, without using the material
guidance suitable to itself, accounting the visible<span
id="iv.ii.i-p9.1"></span>[Psalm
19:1-14](../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001)<span id="iv.ii.i-p9.1"></span>
beauties as reflections of the invisible comeliness; and the sweet <span
id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157) odours of the senses as emblems of the
spiritual distribution; and the material <span
id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158) lights as a likeness of the gift of
the immaterial enlightenment; and the detailed sacred instructions <span
id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159) , of the feast of contemplation within
the mind; and the ranks <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160) of the
orders here, of the harmonious and regulated habit, with regard to
Divine things; and the reception of the most Divine Eucharist, of the
partaking <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161) of Jesus, and whatever
other things were transmitted to Heavenly Beings supermundanely, but to
us symbolically.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p10"></span>For the sake, then, of this our
proportioned deification, the philanthropic Source of sacred mysteries,
by manifesting the Heavenly Hierarchies to us, and constituting our
Hierarchy as fellow-ministers with them, through our imitation of their
Godlike <span id="page_4">p. 4</span> <span
id="iv.ii.i-Page_4"></span>priestliness <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162) , so far as in us lies, described
under sensible likeness the supercelestial Minds, in the inspired
compositions of the Oracles, in order that It might lead us through the
sensible to the intelligible <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163) ,
and from inspired symbols to the simple sublimities of the Heavenly
Hierarchies.
