### <span id="an_xxxvi-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE THIRTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xxxvi-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xxxvi-p3"></span>Who should blame and condemn other men’s
defaults.

<span id="an_xxxvi-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xxxvi-p5"></span>BUT I pray thee, of whom shall men’s deeds
be judged?

<span id="an_xxxvi-p6"></span>Surely of them that have power, and cure
of their souls: either given openly by the statute and the ordinance of
Holy Church, or else privily in spirit at the special stirring of the
Holy Ghost in perfect charity. Each man beware, that he presume not to
take upon him to blame and condemn other men’s defaults, but if he feel
verily that he be stirred of the Holy Ghost within in his work; for else
may he full lightly err in his dooms. And therefore beware: judge
thyself as thee list betwixt thee and thy God or thy ghostly father, and
let other men alone. <span id="an_xxxvi-p6.1"></span><span
