### <span id="an_lviii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE TWO AND FIFTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_lviii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_lviii-p3"></span>How these young presumptuous disciples
misunderstand this word “in,” and of the deceits that follow thereon.

<span id="an_lviii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_lviii-p5"></span>AND on this manner is this madness wrought
that I speak of. They read and hear well said that they should leave
outward working with their wits, and work inwards: and because that they
know not which is inward working, therefore they work wrong. For they
turn their bodily wits inwards to their body against the course of
nature; and strain them, as they would see inwards with their bodily
eyes and hear inwards with their ears, and so forth of all their wits,
smelling, tasting, and feeling inwards. And thus they reverse them
against the course of nature, and with this curiosity <span
id="an_lviii-p5.1"></span><span id="page_238">p. 238</span> <span
id="an_lviii-Page_238"></span> they travail their imagination so
indiscreetly, that at the last they turn their brain in their heads, and
then as fast the devil hath power for to feign some false light or
sounds, sweet smells in their noses, wonderful tastes in their mouths;
and many quaint heats and burnings in their bodily breasts or in their
bowels, in their backs and in their reins and in their members.

<span id="an_lviii-p6"></span>And yet in this fantasy them think that
they have a restful remembrance of their God without any letting of vain
thoughts; and surely so have they in manner, for they be so filled in
falsehood that vanity may not provoke them. And why? Because he, that
same fiend that should minister vain thoughts to them an they were in
good way—he, that same, is the chief worker of this work. And wit thou
right well, that him list not to let himself. The remembrance of God
will he not put from them, for fear that he should be had in suspect.
