### <span id="an_xlvii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE ONE AND FORTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xlvii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xlvii-p3"></span>That in all other works beneath this, men
should keep discretion; but in this none.

<span id="an_xlvii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xlvii-p5"></span>AND furthermore, if thou ask me what
discretion thou shalt have in this work, then I answer thee and say,
right none! For in all thine other doings thou shalt have discretion, as
in eating and in drinking, and in sleeping and in keeping of thy body
from outrageous cold or heat, and in long praying or reading, or in
communing in speech with thine even-christian. In all these shalt thou
keep discretion, that they be neither too much nor too little. But in
this work shalt thou hold no measure: for I would that thou shouldest
never cease of this work the whiles thou livest. <span

id="an_xlvii-Page_203"></span>

<span id="an_xlvii-p6"></span>I say not that thou shalt continue ever
therein alike fresh, for that may not be. For sometime sickness and
other unordained dispositions in body and in soul, with many other
needfulness to nature, will let thee full much, and ofttimes draw thee
down from the height of this working. But I say that thou shouldest
evermore have it either in earnest or in game; that is to say, either in
work or in will. And therefore for God’s love be wary with sickness as
much as thou mayest goodly, so that thou be not the cause of thy
feebleness, as far as thou mayest. For I tell thee truly, that this work
asketh a full great restfulness, and a full whole and clean disposition,
as well in body as in soul.

<span id="an_xlvii-p7"></span>And therefore for God’s love govern thee
discreetly in body and in soul, and get thee thine health as much as
thou mayest. And if sickness come against thy power, have patience and
abide meekly God’s mercy: and all is then good enough. For I tell thee
<span id="an_xlvii-p7.1"></span><span id="page_204">p. 204</span> <span
id="an_xlvii-Page_204"></span> truly, that ofttimes patience in sickness
and in other diverse tribulations pleaseth God much more than any liking
devotion that thou mayest have in thy health. <span

discretion in all other things; and surely else never](cou47)
