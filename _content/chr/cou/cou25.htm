<p><A NAME="an_xxvi-p2"></A><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><A NAME="an_xxvi-p3"></A>How Almighty God will goodly answer for all those that for the excusing of themselves list not leave their business about the love of Him.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_xxvi-p4"></A><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><A NAME="an_xxvi-p5"></A>AND therefore me thinketh, that they that set them to be contemplatives should not only have active men excused of their complaining words, but also me thinketh that they should be so occupied in spirit that they should take little heed or none what men did or said about them. Thus did Mary, our example of all, when Martha her sister complained to our Lord: and if we will truly do thus our Lord will do now for us as He did then for Mary.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_xxvi-p6"></A>And how was that? Surely thus. <A NAME="an_xxvi-p6.1"></A><a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="green">p. 141</font></A> <A NAME="an_xxvi-Page_141"></A> Our lovely Lord Jesus Christ, unto whom no privy thing is hid, although He was required of Martha as doomsman for to bid Mary rise and help her to serve Him; nevertheless yet, for He perceived that Mary was fervently occupied in spirit about the love of His Godhead, therefore courteously and as it was seemly for Him to do by the way of reason, He answered for her, that for the excusing of herself list not leave the love of Him. And how answered He? Surely not only as doomsman, as He was of Martha appealed: but as an advocate lawfully defended her that Him loved, and said, &#8220;Martha, Martha!&#8221; Twice for speed He named her name; for He would that she heard Him and took heed to His words. &#8220;Thou art full busy,&#8221; He said, &#8220;and troubled about many things.&#8221; For they that be actives behove always to be busied and travailed about many diverse things, the which them falleth, first for to have to their own use, and <A NAME="an_xxvi-p6.2"></A><a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="green">p. 142</font></A> <A NAME="an_xxvi-Page_142"></A> sithen in deeds of mercy to their even-christian, as charity asketh. And this He said unto Martha, for He would let her wit that her business was good and profitable to the health of her soul. But for this, that she should not think that it were the best work of all that man might do, therefore He added and said: &#8216;But one thing is necessary.&#8217;</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_xxvi-p7"></A>And what is that one thing? Surely that God be loved and praised by Himself, above all other business bodily or ghostly that man may do. And for this, that Martha should not think that she might both love God and praise Him above all other business bodily or ghostly, and also thereto to be busy about the necessaries of this life: therefore to deliver her of doubt that she might not both serve God in bodily business and ghostly together perfectly&#8209;&#8212;imperfectly she may, but not perfectly&#8212;He added and said, that Mary had chosen the best part; the which should never be taken from <A NAME="an_xxvi-p7.1"></A><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="green">p. 143</font></A> <A NAME="an_xxvi-Page_143"></A> her. For why, that perfect stirring of love that beginneth here is even in number with that that shall last without end in the bliss of heaven, for all it is but one. <A NAME="an_xxvi-p7.2"></A><a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="green">p. 144</font></A> <A NAME="an_xxvi-Page_144"></A> </p>
