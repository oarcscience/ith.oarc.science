### <span id="an_xii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE SIXTH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xii-p3"></span>A short conceit of the work of this book,
treated by question.

<span id="an_xii-p4"></span> 

<span id="an_xii-p5"></span>BUT now thou askest me and sayest, “How
shall I think on Himself, and what is He?” and to this I cannot answer
thee but thus: “I wot not.”

<span id="an_xii-p6"></span>For thou hast brought me with thy question
into that same darkness, and into that same cloud of unknowing, that I
would thou wert in thyself. For of all other creatures and their works,
yea, and of the works of God’s self, may a man through grace have
fullhead of knowing, and well he can think of them: but of God Himself
can no man think. And therefore I would leave all that thing that I can
think, and choose to my love that thing that I cannot think. For why;
<span id="an_xii-p6.1"></span><span id="page_89">p. 89</span> <span
id="an_xii-Page_89"></span> He may well be loved, but not thought. By
love may He be gotten and holden; but by thought never. And therefore,
although it be good sometime to think of the kindness and the worthiness
of God in special, and although it be a light and a part of
contemplation: nevertheless yet in this work it shall be cast down and
covered with a cloud of forgetting. And thou shalt step above it
stalwartly, but Mistily, with a devout and a pleasing stirring of love,
and try for to pierce that darkness above thee. And smite upon that
thick cloud of unknowing with a sharp dart of longing love; and go not
thence for thing that befalleth. <span id="an_xii-p6.2"></span><span

thoughts, and specially against all those that arise of his own
curiosity, of cunning, and of natural wit](cou12)
