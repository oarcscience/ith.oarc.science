<P>
This is Evelyn Underhill's translation of the medieval spiritual
guidebook called <CITE>The Cloud of Unknowing</CITE>, written
by an anonymous English monk.
At the core is a mystical approach to Christian prayer, in which
God is found not through rote knowledge, but through 'blind love.'
It has been described as Christianity with a Zen outlook.
--J.B. Hare
