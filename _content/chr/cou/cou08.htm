<p><A NAME="an_ix-p3"></A>How the work of this book shall be wrought, and of the worthiness of it before all other works.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_ix-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_ix-p5"></A>LIFT up thine heart unto God with a meek stirring of love; and mean Himself, and none of His goods. And thereto, look the loath to think on aught but Himself. So that nought work in thy wit, nor in thy will, but only Himself. And do that in thee is to forget all the creatures that ever God made and the works of them; so that thy thought nor thy desire be not directed nor stretched to any of them, neither in general nor in special, but let them be, and take no heed to them. This is the work of the soul that most pleaseth God. All saints and angels have joy of this work, and hasten them <A NAME="an_ix-p5.1"></A><a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="green">p. 72</font></A> <A NAME="an_ix-Page_72"></A> to help it in all their might. All fiends be furious when thou thus dost, and try for to defeat it in all that they can. All men living in earth be wonderfully holpen of this work, thou wottest not how. Yea, the souls in purgatory be eased of their pain by virtue of this work. Thyself art cleansed and made virtuous by no work so much. And yet it is the lightest work of all, when a soul is helped with grace in sensible list, and soonest done. But else it is hard, and wonderful to thee for to do.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_ix-p6"></A>Let not, therefore, but travail therein till thou feel list. For at the first time when thou dost it, thou findest but a darkness; and as it were a cloud of unknowing, thou knowest not what, saving that thou feelest in thy will a naked intent unto God. This darkness and this cloud is, howsoever thou dost, betwixt thee and thy God, and letteth thee that thou mayest neither see Him clearly by light of understanding in thy reason, nor feel Him in sweetness of love in thine affection. <A NAME="an_ix-p6.1"></A><a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="green">p. 73</font></A> <A NAME="an_ix-Page_73"></A> </p>  
<p><A NAME="an_ix-p7"></A>And therefore shape thee to bide in this darkness as long as thou mayest, evermore crying after Him that thou lovest. For if ever thou shalt feel Him or see Him, as it may be here, it behoveth always to be in this cloud in this darkness. And if thou wilt busily travail as I bid thee, I trust in His mercy that thou shalt come thereto. <A NAME="an_ix-p7.1"></A><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="green">p. 74</font></A> <A NAME="an_ix-Page_74"></A> </p>
