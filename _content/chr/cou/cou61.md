### <span id="an_lxii-p1.1"></span> HERE BEGINNETH THE SIX AND FIFTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_lxii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_lxii-p3"></span>

<span id="an_lxii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_lxii-p5"></span>SOME there be, that although they be not
deceived with this error as it is set here, yet for pride and curiosity
of natural wit and letterly cunning leave the common doctrine and the
counsel of Holy Church. And these with all their favourers lean over
much to their own knowing: and for they were never grounded in meek
blind feeling and virtuous living, therefore they merit to have a false
feeling, feigned and wrought by the ghostly enemy. Insomuch, that at the
last they burst up and blaspheme all the saints, sacraments, <span
id="an_lxii-p5.1"></span><span id="page_253">p. 253</span> <span
id="an_lxii-Page_253"></span> statutes, and ordinances of Holy Church.
Fleshly living men of the world, the which think the statutes of Holy
Church over hard to be amended by, they lean to these heretics full soon
and full lightly, and stalwartly maintain them, and all because them
think that they lead them a softer way than is ordained of Holy Church.

<span id="an_lxii-p6"></span>Now truly I trow, that who that will not go
the strait way to heaven, that they shall go the soft way to hell. Each
man prove by himself, for I trow that all such heretics, and all their
favourers, an they might clearly be seen as they shall on the last day,
should be seen full soon cumbered in great and horrible sins of the
world in their foul flesh, privily, without their open presumption in
maintaining of error: so that they be full properly called Antichrist’s
disciples. For it is said of them, that for all their false fairness
openly, yet they should be full foul lechers privily. <span
