### <span id="an_xliii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE SEVEN AND THIRTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xliii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xliii-p3"></span>Of the special prayers of them that be
continual workers in the word of this book

<span id="an_xliii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xliii-p5"></span>AND right as the meditations of them that
continually work in this grace and in this work rise suddenly without
any means, right so do their prayers. I mean of their special prayers,
not of those prayers that be ordained of Holy Church. For they that be
true workers in this work, they worship no prayer so much: and therefore
they do them, in the form and in the statute that they be ordained of
holy fathers before us. But their special prayers rise evermore suddenly
unto God, without any means or any premeditation <span
id="an_xliii-p5.1"></span><span id="page_191">p. 191</span> <span
id="an_xliii-Page_191"></span> in special coming before, or going
therewith.

<span id="an_xliii-p6"></span>And if they be in words, as they be but
seldom, then be they but in full few words: yea, and in ever the fewer
the better. Yea, and if it be but a little word of one syllable, me
think it better than of two: and more, too, according to the work of the
spirit, since it so is that a ghostly worker in this work should
evermore be in the highest and the sovereignest point of the spirit.
That this be sooth, see by ensample in the course of nature. A man or a
woman, afraid with any sudden chance of fire or of man’s death or what
else that it be, suddenly in the height of his spirit, he is driven upon
haste and upon need for to cry or for to pray after help. Yea, how?
Surely, not in many words, nor yet in one word of two syllables. And why
is that? For him thinketh it over long tarrying for to declare the need
and the work of his spirit. And therefore he bursteth up hideously <span
id="an_xliii-p6.1"></span><span id="page_192">p. 192</span> <span
id="an_xliii-Page_192"></span> with a great spirit, and cryeth a little
word, but of one syllable: as is this word “fire,” or this word “out!”

<span id="an_xliii-p7"></span>And right as this little word “fire”
stirreth rather and pierceth more hastily the ears of the hearers, so
doth a little word of one syllable when it is not only spoken or
thought, but privily meant in the deepness of spirit; the which is the
height, for in ghostliness all is one, height and deepness, length and
breadth. And rather it pierceth the ears of Almighty God than doth any
long psalter unmindfully mumbled in the teeth. And herefore it is
written, that short prayer pierceth heaven. <span
