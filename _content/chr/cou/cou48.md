### <span id="an_xlix-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE THREE AND FORTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xlix-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xlix-p3"></span>That all witting and feeling of a man’s own
being must needs be lost if the perfection of this word shall verily be
felt in any soul in this life.

<span id="an_xlix-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xlix-p5"></span>LOOK that nought work in thy wit nor in thy
will but only God. And try for to fell all witting and feeling of ought
under God, and tread all down full far under the cloud of forgetting.
And thou shalt understand, that thou shalt not only in this work forget
all other creatures than thyself, or their deeds or thine, but also thou
shalt in this work forget both thyself and also thy deeds for God, as
well as all other creatures and their deeds. For it is the condition of
a perfect lover, not only to love that thing that he loveth <span
id="an_xlix-p5.1"></span><span id="page_208">p. 208</span> <span
id="an_xlix-Page_208"></span> more than himself; but also in a manner
for to hate himself for that thing that he loveth.

<span id="an_xlix-p6"></span>Thus shalt thou do with thyself: thou shalt
loathe and be weary with all that thing that worketh in thy wit and in
thy will unless it be only God. For why, surely else, whatsoever that it
be, it is betwixt thee and thy God. And no wonder though thou loathe and
hate for to think on thyself, when thou shalt always feel sin, a foul
stinking lump thou wottest never what, betwixt thee and thy God: the
which lump is none other thing than thyself. For thou shalt think it
oned and congealed with the substance of thy being: yea, as it were
without departing.

<span id="an_xlix-p7"></span>And therefore break down all witting and
feeling of all manner of creatures; but most busily of thyself. For on
the witting and the feeling of thyself hangeth witting and feeling of
all other creatures; for in regard of it, all other creatures be lightly
forgotten. For, an thou wilt busily set thee to <span
id="an_xlix-p7.1"></span><span id="page_209">p. 209</span> <span
id="an_xlix-Page_209"></span> the proof, thou shalt find when thou hast
forgotten all other creatures and all their works—yea, and thereto all
thine own works—that there shall live yet after, betwixt thee and thy
God, a naked witting and a feeling of thine own being: the which witting
and feeling behoveth always be destroyed, ere the time be that thou feel
soothfastly the perfection of this work. <span

destroy all witting and feeling of its own being](cou49)
