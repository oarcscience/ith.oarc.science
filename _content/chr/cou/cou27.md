### <span id="an_xxviii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE TWO AND TWENTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xxviii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xxviii-p3"></span>Of the wonderful love that Christ had to
man in person of all sinners truly turned and called to the grace of
contemplation.

<span id="an_xxviii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xxviii-p5"></span>SWEET was that love betwixt our Lord and
Mary. Much love had she to Him. Much more had He to her. For whoso would
utterly behold all the behaviour that was betwixt Him and her, not as a
trifler may tell, but as the story of the gospel will witness—the which
on nowise may be false—he should find that she was so heartily set for
to love Him, that nothing beneath Him might comfort her, nor yet hold
her heart from Him. This is she, that same Mary, that when she sought
Him at the sepulchre with weeping cheer would not be comforted of
angels. For when they spake unto <span id="an_xxviii-p5.1"></span><span
id="page_149">p. 149</span> <span id="an_xxviii-Page_149"></span> her so
sweetly and so lovely and said, “Weep not, Mary; for why, our Lord whom
thou seekest is risen, and thou shalt have Him, and see Him live full
fair amongst His disciples in Galilee as He hight,” she would not cease
for them. For why? Her thought that whoso sought verily the King of
Angels, them list not cease for angels.

<span id="an_xxviii-p6"></span>And what more? Surely whoso will look
verily in the story of the gospel, he shall find many wonderful points
of perfect love written of her to our ensample, and as even according to
the work of this writing, as if they had been set and written therefore;
and surely so were they, take whoso take may. And if a man list for to
see in the gospel written the wonderful and the special love that our
Lord had to her, in person of all accustomed sinners truly turned and
called to the grace of contemplation, he shall find that our Lord might
not suffer any man or woman—yea, not <span
id="an_xxviii-p6.1"></span><span id="page_150">p. 150</span> <span
id="an_xxviii-Page_150"></span> her own sister—speak a word against her,
but if He answered for her Himself. Yea, and what more? He blamed Symon
Leprous in his own house, for that he thought against her. This was
great love: this was passing love. <span

themselves](cou28)
