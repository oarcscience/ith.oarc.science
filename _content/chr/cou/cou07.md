### <span id="an_viii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE SECOND CHAPTER

<span id="an_viii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_viii-p3"></span>A short stirring to meekness, and to the
work of this book.

<span id="an_viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="an_viii-p5"></span>LOOK up now, weak wretch, and see what thou
art. What art thou, and what hast thou merited, thus to be called of our
Lord? What weary wretched heart, and sleeping in sloth, is that, the
which is not wakened with the draught of this love and the voice of this
calling! Beware, thou wretch, in this while with thine enemy; and hold
thee never the holier nor the better, for the worthiness of this calling
and for the singular form of living that thou art in. But the more
wretched and cursed, unless thou do that in thee is goodly, by grace and
by counsel, to live after thy calling. And insomuch thou shouldest be
more <span id="an_viii-p5.1"></span><span id="page_69">p. 69</span>
<span id="an_viii-Page_69"></span> meek and loving to thy ghostly
spouse, that He that is the Almighty God, King of Kings and Lord of
Lords, would meek Him so low unto thee, and amongst all the flock of His
sheep so graciously would choose thee to be one of His specials, and
sithen set thee in the place of pasture, where thou mayest be fed with
the sweetness of His love, in earnest of thine heritage the Kingdom of
Heaven.

<span id="an_viii-p6"></span>Do on then, I pray thee, fast. Look now
forwards and let be backwards; and see what thee faileth, and not what
thou hast, for that is the readiest getting and keeping of meekness. All
thy life now behoveth altogether to stand in desire, if thou shalt
profit in degree of perfection. This desire behoveth altogether be
wrought in thy will, by the hand of Almighty God and thy consent. But
one thing I tell thee. He is a jealous lover and suffereth no
fellowship, and Him list not work in thy will but if He be only with
thee by Himself. He asketh <span id="an_viii-p6.1"></span><span
id="page_70">p. 70</span> <span id="an_viii-Page_70"></span> none help,
but only thyself. He wills, thou do but look on Him and let Him alone.
And keep thou the windows and the door, for flies and enemies assailing.
And if thou be willing to do this, thee needeth but meekly press upon
him with prayer, and soon will He help thee. Press on then, let see how
thou bearest thee. He is full ready, and doth but abideth thee. But what
shalt thou do, and how shalt thou press? <span
