### <span id="an_lxviii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE TWO AND SIXTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_lxviii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_lxviii-p3"></span>How a man may wit when his ghostly work
is beneath him or without him, and when it is even with him or within
him, and when it is above him and under his God.

<span id="an_lxviii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_lxviii-p5"></span>AND for this, that thou shalt be able
better to wit how they shall be conceived ghostly, these words that be
spoken bodily, therefore I think to declare to thee the ghostly
bemeaning of some words that fall to ghostly working. So that thou
mayest wit clearly without error when thy ghostly work is beneath thee
and without thee, and when it is within thee and even with thee, and
when it is above thee and under thy God.

<span id="an_lxviii-p6"></span>All manner of bodily thing is without thy
soul and beneath it in nature, <span id="an_lxviii-p6.1"></span><span
id="page_274">p. 274</span> <span id="an_lxviii-Page_274"></span> yea!
the sun and the moon and all the stars, although they be above thy body,
nevertheless yet they be beneath thy soul.

<span id="an_lxviii-p7"></span>All angels and all souls, although they
be confirmed and adorned with grace and with virtues, for the which they
be above thee in cleanness, nevertheless, yet they be but even with thee
in nature.

<span id="an_lxviii-p8"></span>Within in thyself in nature be the powers
of thy soul: the which be these three principal, Memory, Reason, and
Will; and secondary, Imagination and Sensuality.

<span id="an_lxviii-p9"></span>Above thyself in nature is no manner of
thing but only God.

<span id="an_lxviii-p10"></span>Evermore where thou findest written
thyself in ghostliness, then it is understood thy soul, and not thy
body. And then all after that thing is on the which the powers of thy
soul work, thereafter shall the worthiness and the condition of thy work
be deemed; whether it be beneath thee, within thee, or above thee. <span

special is a principal power comprehending in it all the other powers
and all those things in the which they work](cou68)
