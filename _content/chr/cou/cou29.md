### <span id="an_xxx-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE FOUR AND TWENTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xxx-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xxx-p3"></span>What charity is in itself, and how it is
truly and perfectly contained in the work of this book.

<span id="an_xxx-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xxx-p5"></span>AND as it is said of meekness, how that it
is truly and perfectly comprehended in this little blind love pressed,
when it is beating upon this dark cloud of unknowing, all other things
put down and forgotten: so it is to be understood of all other virtues,
and specially of charity.

<span id="an_xxx-p6"></span>For charity is nought else to bemean to
thine understanding, but love of God for Himself above all creatures,
and of man for God even as thyself. And that in this work God is loved
for Himself, and above all creatures, it seemeth right well. For as it
is said <span id="an_xxx-p6.1"></span><span id="page_156">p. 156</span>
<span id="an_xxx-Page_156"></span> before, that the substance of this
work is nought else but a naked intent directed unto God for Himself.

<span id="an_xxx-p7"></span>A naked intent I call it. For why, in this
work a perfect Prentice asketh neither releasing of pain, nor increasing
of meed, nor shortly to say, nought but Himself. Insomuch, that neither
he recketh nor looketh after whether that he be in pain or in bliss,
else that His will be fulfilled that he loveth. And thus it seemeth that
in this work God is perfectly loved for Himself, and that above all
creatures. For in this work, a perfect worker may not suffer the memory
of the holiest creature that ever God made to commune with him.

<span id="an_xxx-p8"></span>And that in this work the second and the
lower branch of charity unto thine even‑christian is verily and
perfectly fulfilled, it seemeth by the proof. For why, in this work a
perfect worker hath no special beholding unto any man by himself,
whether that he be kin or stranger, friend or foe. For all men <span
id="an_xxx-p8.1"></span><span id="page_157">p. 157</span> <span
id="an_xxx-Page_157"></span> him thinks equally kin unto him, and no man
stranger. All men him thinks be his friends, and none his foes.
Insomuch, that him thinks all those that pain him and do him disease in
this life, they be his full and his special friends: and him thinketh,
that he is stirred to will them as much good, as he would to the
homeliest friend that he hath. <span id="an_xxx-p8.2"></span><span

special beholding to any one man in this life](cou30)
