#### Chapter 149

The Jews gather in Jerusalem to attend the feast. The Christines go to
Jericho. Jesus dines with Zaccheus. He relates the parable of the ten
talents.  
  
**1.** The great passover of the Jews, the feast of spring, was calling
every loyal Jew up to Jerusalem.  
**2.** Ten days before the feast the Lord and his disciples left the
Ephraim hills and by the Jordan way, went down to Jericho.  
**3.** And as they entered Jericho a wealthy publican came out to see
the Lord; but he was small in stature and the throng was great and he
could see him not.  
**4.** A tree, a sycamore, stood by the way and he climbed up the tree
and found a seat among its boughs.  
**5.** When Jesus came, he saw the man and said, O Zacheus, make haste,
come down; I would abide with you to-day.  
**6.** And Zaccheus came down and joyfully received the Lord; but many
of the stricter sect called out and said,  
**7.** For shame! he goes to lodge with Zaccheu, the sinner and the
publican.  
**8.** But Jesus did not care for what they said; he went his way with
Zaccheus, who was a man of faith, and as they talked together Zaccheus
said,  
**9.** Lord, I have ever tried to do the right; I give unto the poor
half of my goods, and if by any means I wrong a man, I right the wrong
by paying him four fold.  
**10.** And Jesus said to him, Your life and faith are known to God, and
lo, the benedictions of the Lord of hosts abide with you and all your
house.  
**11.** Then Jesus spoke a parable to all; he said, A vassal of an
emperor was made a king, and he went to the foreign land to claim his
rights and take the kingdom to himself.  
**12.** Before he went he called ten trusted servants and to each he
gave a pound and said,  
**13.** Go forth and use these pounds as you have opportunity, that you
may gain for me more wealth, And then he went his way.  
**14.** And after many days he came again, and called the ten, demanding
a report.  
**15.** The first one came and said, Lord, I have gained nine pounds;
you gave me one and here are ten.  
**16.** The king replied, Well done, you faithful man; because you have
been faithful in a little thing I judge that you will be a faithful
servant in a greater thing;  
**17.** Behold, I make you ruler over nine important cities of my
realm.  
**18.** The second came and said, Lord, I have gained for you four
pounds; you gave me one, and here are five.  
**19.** The king replied, And you have proven up your faithfulness.
Behold, I make you ruler over four important cities of my realm.  
**20.** another came and said, Lord, I have doubled what you gave to me.
You gave one pound to me and here are two.  
**21.** The ruler said, And you have proved your faithfulness; Behold, I
make you ruler over one important city of my realm.  
**22.** Another came and said, Lord, here is what you gave to me. I knew
you were an austere man, oft reaping where you did not sow and I was
sore afraid, and so I took the pound you gave to me and hid it in a
secret place; and here it is.  
**23.** The king exclaimed, You slothful man! you knew what I required,
that I expected every man to do his best.  
**24.** If you were timid and afraid to trust your judgment in the marts
of trade, why did you not go forth and put my money out for gain, that I
could have my own with interest?  
**25.** Then turning to the steward of his wealth the ruler said, Take
you this pound and give it unto him who has by diligence earned nine.  
**26.** For lo, I say, that every one who uses what he has and gains,
shall have abundantly; but he who hides away his talent in the earth
shall forfeit what he has.
