#### Chapter 177

Jesus appears, fully materialised, in the temple in Jerusalem. Rebukes
the rulers of the Jews for their hypocrisy. Reveals himself to them and
they fall back in fear. He appears to the apotles in Simon's house.
Thomas is convinced.  
  
**1.** It was the Sabbath day and many priests and scribes and Pharisees
were in the temple in Jerusalem. Caiaphas, Annas and some other ruling
Jews were there.  
**2.** A stranger came in garb of fisherman and asked, What has become
of Jesus who is called the Christ? Is he not teaching in the temple
now?  
**3.** The Jews replied, That man from Galilee was crucified a week ago,
because he was a dangerous man, a vile, seditious man.  
**4.** The stranger asked, Where did you put the body of this man from
Galilee? Where is his tomb?  
**5.** The Jews replied, We do not know. His followers came at night and
stole the body from the tomb in which it lay and carried it away, and
the declared that he had risen from the dead.  
**6.** The stranger asked, How do you know that his disciples stole the
body from the tomb? was any one a witness of the theft?  
**7.** The Jews replied, We had a hundred soldiers at the place, and
every one of them declares that his disciples stole the body from the
tomb.  
**8.** The stranger asked, Will any one of all your hundred men stand
forth and say, I saw the body stolen from the tomb?  
**9.** The Jews replied, We do not know; these men are men of truth; we
cannot doubt their word.  
**10.** The stranger said, You priests and scribes and Pharisees hear
me: I was a witness of the facts, was in the garden of Siloam, and stood
among your hundred men.  
**11.** And this I know that not a man among your hundred men will say,
I saw the body stolen from the tomb.  
**12.** And I will testify before the God of heaven and earth, The body
was not stolen from the tomb; the man from Galilee is risen from the
dead.  
**13.** And then the priests and scribes and Pharisees rushed up to
seize the man and cast him out.  
**14.** But instantly the fisherman became a radiant form of light, and
priests and scribes and Pharisees fell back in deadly fear; they saw the
man from Galilee.  
**15.** And Jesus looked upon the frightened men and said, This is the
body that you stoned beyond the city's gates and crucified on Calvary.  
**16.** Behold my hands, my feet, my side and see the wounds the
soldiers made.  
**17.** If you believe that I am phantom made of air, come forth and
handle me; ghosts do not carry flesh and bones.  
**18.** I came to earth to demonstrate the resurrection of the dead, the
transmutation of the flesh of carnal man to flesh of man divine.  
**19.** Then Jesus raised his hands and said, Peace be to every one of
you; goodwill to all mankind. And then he disappeared.  
**20.** Now, Thomas, had not seen the Lord since he had risen from the
dead, and when the ten averred that they had seen and talked with him he
said,  
**21.** Until I see the nail prints in his hands and feet, the spear
wound in his side, and talk with him as I have talked with him before, I
cannot have a reason to believe that he is risen from the dead.  
**22.** At Simon's house in Bethany the men from Galilee had met. It was
the evening of the first day of the week, and on the morrow all would
turn their faces toward their homes.  
**23.** The eleven apostles all were there: the doors were closed and
barred, and Jesus came and said, Peace be to all!  
**24.** And then he said to Thomas, Friend, you do not know that I have
risen from the dead; the time has come for you to know.  
**25.** Come here and see the nail prints in my hands, the spear wound
in my side, and talk with me as you have often talked with me.  
**26.** And Thomas came and saw and then exclaimed, My master, and my
Lord! I do not now believe, I know that you are risen from the dead.  
**27.** And Jesus said, Because you see me you believe, and blessed are
your eyes;  
**28.** But blessed thrice are they who see me not and yet believe.  
**29.** Then Jesus vanished from their sight, but the disciples were
established in their faith.
