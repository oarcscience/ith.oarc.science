#### Chapter 168

Pilate's final effort to release Jesus fails. He washes his hands in
feigned innocence. Delivers Jesus to the Jews for execution. The Jewish
soldiers drive him to Calvary.  
  
**1.** A Superstitious people are the Jews. They have a faith that they
have borrowed from the idol worshippers of other lands, that at the end
of every year,  
**2.** They may heap all their sins upon the head of some man set apart
to bear their sins.  
**3.** The man becomes a scapegoat for the multitudes; and they believe
that when they drive him forth into the wilds, or into foreign lands,
they are released from sin.  
**4.** So every spring before the feast they chose a prisoner from the
prisons of the land, and by a form their own, they fain would make him
bear their sins away.  
**5.** Among the Jewish prisoners in Jerusalem were three who were the
leaders of a vile, seditious band, who had engages in thefts and murders
and rapine, and had been sentenced to be crucified.  
**6.** Barabbas bar Jezia was among the men who were to die; but he was
rich and he had bought of priests the boon to be scapegoat for the
people at the coming feast, and he was anxiously in waiting for his hour
to come.  
**7.** Now, Pilate thought to turn this superstition to account to save
the Lord, and so he went again before the Jews and said,  
**8.** You men of Israel, according to my custom I will release to you
to-day a prisoner who shall bear you sins away.  
**9.** This man you drive into the wilds or into foreign lands, and you
have asked me to release Barabbas, who has been proven guilty of the
murder of a score of men.  
**10.** Now, hear me men, Let Jesus be released and let Barabbas pay his
debt upon the cross; then you can send this Jesus to the wilds and hear
no more of him.  
**11.** At what the ruler said the people were enraged, and they began
to plot to tear the Roman palace down and drive in exile Pilate, and his
household and his guards.  
**12.** When Pilate was assured that civil war would follow if he heeded
not the wishes of the mob, he took a bowl of water and in the presence
of the multitude he washed hid hands and said,  
**13.** This man whom you accuse is son of the most holy Gods, and I
proclaim my innocence.  
**14.** If you would shed his blood, his blood is on your hands and not
on mine.  
**15.** And then the Jews exclaimed, And let his blood be on our hands
and on our children's hands.  
**16.** And Pilate trembled like a leaf, in fear. Barabbas he released
and as the Lord stood forth before the mob the ruler said, Behold your
king! And would you put to death your king?  
**17.** The Jews replied, He is no king; we have no king but great
Tiberius.  
**18.** Now, Pilate would not give consent that Roman soldiers should
imbue their hands in blood of innocence, and so the chief priests and
the Pharisees took counsel what to do with Jesus, who was called the
Christ.  
**19.** Caiaphas said, We cannot crucify this man; he must be stoned to
death and nothing more.  
**20.** And then the rabble said, Make haste! let him be stoned. And
then they led him forth toward the hill beyond the city's gates, where
criminals were put to death.  
**21.** The rabble could not wait until they reached the place of
skulls. As soon as they had passed the city's gate, they rushed upon
him, smote him with their hands, they spit upon him, stoned and he fell
upon the ground.  
**22.** And one, a man of God, stood forth and said, Isaiah said, He
shall be bruised for our transgressions and by his stripes we shall be
healed.  
**23.** As Jesus lay all bruised and mangled on the ground a Pharisee
called out, Stay, stay you men! behold, the guards of Herod come and
they will crucify this man.  
**24.** And there beside the city's gate they found Barabbas's cross;
and then the frenzied mob cried out, Let him be crucified.  
**25.** Caiaphas and the other ruling Jews came forth and gave
consent.  
**26.** And then they lifted Jesus from the ground, and at the point of
swords they drove him on.  
**27.** A man named Simon, a friend of Jesus, was a-near the scene and
since the bruised and wounded Jesus could not bear his cross, they laid
it on the shoulders of this man and made him bear it on to Calvary.
