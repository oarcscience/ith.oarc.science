#### SECTION XI  CAPH  Life and Works of Jesus in Egypt

#### Chapter 47

Jesus with Elihu and Salome in Egypt. Tells the story of his journeys.
Elihu and Salome praise God. Jesus goes to the temple in Heliopolis and
is received as a pupil.  
  
**1.** And Jesus came to Egypt land and all was well. He tarried not
upon the coast; he went at once to Zoan, home of Elihu and Salome, who
five and twenty years before had taught his mother in their sacred
school.  
**2.** And there was joy when met these three. When last the son of Mary
saw these sacred groves he was a babe;  
**3.** And now a man grown strong by buffeting of every kind; a teacher
who had stirred the multitudes in many lands.  
**4.** And Jesus told the aged teachers all about his life; about his
journeyings in foreign lands; about the meetings with the masters and
about his kind receptions by the multitudes.  
**5.** Elihu and Salome heard his story with delight; they lifted up
their eyes to heaven and said,  
**6.** Our Father-God, let now thy servants go in peace, for we have
seen the glory of the Lord;  
**7.** And we have talked with him, the messenger of love, and of the
covenant of peace on earth, good will to men.  
**8.** Through him shall all the nations of the earth be blest; through
him, Immanuel.  
**9.** And Jesus stayed in Zoan many days; and then went forth unto the
city of the sun, that men call Heliopolis, and sought admission to the
temple of the sacred brotherhood.  
**10.** The council of the brotherhood convened, and Jesus stood before
the hierophant; he answered all the questions that were asked with
clearness and with power.  
**11.** The hierophant exclaimed, Rabboni of the rabbinate, why come you
here? Your wisdom is the wisdom of the gods; why seek for wisdom in the
halls of men?  
**12.** And Jesus said, In every way of earth-life I would walk; in
every hall of learning I would sit; the heights that any man has gained,
these I would gain;  
**13.** What any man has suffered I would meet, that I may know the
griefs, the disappointments and the sore temptations of my brother man;
that I may know just how to succour those in need.  
**14.** I pray you, brothers, let me go into your dismal crypts; and I
would pass the hardest of your tests.  
**15.** The master said, Take then the vow of secret brotherhood. And
Jesus took the vow of secret brotherhood.  
**16.** Again the master spoke; he said, The greatest heights are gained
by those who reach the greatest depths; and you shall reach the greatest
depths.  
**17.** The guide then led the way and in the fountain Jesus bathed; and
when he had been clothed in proper garb he stood again before the
hierophant.
