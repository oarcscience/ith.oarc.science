#### Chapter 37

Jesus is presented with a camel. He goes to Lahore where he abides with
Ajainin, whom he teaches. Lesson of the wandering musicians. Jesus
resumes his journey.  
  
**1.** A Caravan of merchantmen were journeying through the Kashmar vale
as Jesus passed that way, and they are going to Lahore, a city of the
Hand, the five-stream land.  
**2.** The merchantmen had heard the prophet speak, had seen his mighty
works in Leh, and they were glad to see him once again.  
**3.** And when they knew that he was going to Lahore and then across
the Sind, through Persia and the farther West, and that he had no beast
on which to ride,  
**4.** They freely gave to him a noble bactrian beast, well saddled and
equipped, and Jesus journeyed with the caravan.  
**5.** And when he reached Lahore, Ajainin and some other Brahmic
priests, received him with delight.  
**6.** Ajainin was the priest who came to Jesus in the night time in
Benares many months before, and heard he words of truth.  
**7.** And Jesus was Ajainin's guest; he taught Ajainin many things;
revealed to him the secrets of the healing art.  
**8.** He taught him how he could control the spirits of the air, the
fire, the water and the earth; and he explained to him the secret
doctrine of forgiveness, and the blotting out of sins.  
**9.** One day Ajainin sat with Jesus in the temple porch; a band of
wandering singers and musicians paused before the court to sing and
play.  
**10.** Their music was most rich and delicate, and Jesus said, Among
the high-breed people of the land we hear no sweeter music than that
these uncouth children of the wilderness bring here to us.  
**11.** From whence this talent and this power? In one short life they
could not gain such grace of voice, such knowledge of the laws of
harmony and tone.  
**12.** Men call them prodigies. There are no prodigies. All things
result from natural law.  
**13.** These people are not young. A thousand years would not suffice
to give them such divine expressiveness, and such purity of voice and
touch.  
**14.** Ten thousand years ago these people mastered harmony. In days of
old they trod the busy thoroughfares of life, and caught the melody of
birds, and played on harps of perfect form.  
**15.** And they have come again to learn still other lessons from the
varied notes of manifests.  
**16.** These wandering people form a part of heaven's orchestra, and in
the land of perfect things the very angels will delight to hear them
play and sing.  
**17.** And Jesus taught the common people of Lahore; he healed their
sick, and showed to them the way to rise to better things by
helpfulness.  
**18.** He said, We are not rich by what we get and hold; the only
things we keep are those we give away.  
**19.** If you would live the perfect life, give forth your life in
service for your kind, and for the forms of life that men esteem the
lower forms of life.  
**20.** But Jesus could not tarry longer in Lahore; he bade the priests
and other friends farewell; and then he took his camel and he went his
way toward the Sind.
