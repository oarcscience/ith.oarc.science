#### Chapter 22

The friendship of Jesus and Lamaas. Jesus explains to Lamaas the meaning
of truth, man, power, understanding, wisdom, salvation and faith.  
  
**1.** Among the priests of Jagannath was one who loved the Jewish boy.
Lamaas Bramas was the name by which the priest was known.  
**2.** One day as Jesus and Lamaas walked alone in plaza Jagannath,
Lamaas said, My Jewish master, what is truth?  
**3.** And Jesus said, Truth is the only thing that changes not.  
**4.** In all the world there are two things; the one is truth; the
other falsehood is; and truth is that which is, and falsehood that which
seems to be.  
**5.** Now truth is aught, and has no cause, and yet it is the cause of
everything.  
**6.** Falsehood is naught, and yet it is the manifest of aught.  
**7.** Whatever has been made will be unmade; that which begins must
end.  
**8.** All things that can be seen by human eyes are manifests of aught,
are naught, and so must pass away.  
**9.** The things we see are but reflexes just appearing, while the
ethers vibrate so and so, and when conditions change they disappear.  
**10.** The Holy Breath is truth; is that which was, and is, and
evermore shall be; it cannot change nor pass away.  
**11.** Lamaas said, You answer well; now, what is man?  
**12.** And Jesus said, Man is the truth and falsehood strangely
mixed.  
**13.** Man is the Breath made flesh; so truth and falsehood are
conjoined in him; and they strive, and naught goes down and man as truth
abides.  
**14.** Again Lamaas asked, What do you say of power?  
**15.** And Jesus said, It is a manifest; is the result of force; it is
but naught; it is illusion, nothing more. Force changes not, but power
changes as the ethers change.  
**16.** Force is the will of God and is omnipotent, and power is that
will in manifest, directed by the Breath.  
**17.** There is power in the winds, a power in the waves, a power in
the lightning's stroke, a power in the human arm, a power in the eye.  
**18.** The ethers cause there powers to be, and thought of Elohim, of
angel, man, or other thinking thing, directs the force; when it has done
its work the power is no more.  
**19.** Again Lamaas asked, Of understanding what have you to say?  
**20.** And Jesus said, It is the rock on which man builds himself; it
is the gnosis of the aught and of the naught, of falsehood and of
truth.  
**21.** It is the knowledge of the lower self; the sensing of the powers
of man himself.  
**22.** Again Lamaas asked, Of wisdom what have you to say?  
**23.** And Jesus said, It is the consciousness that man is aught; that
God and man are one;  
**24.** That naught is naught; that power is but illusion; that heaven
and earth and hell are not above, around, below, but in; which in the
light of aught becomes the naught, and God is all.  
**25.** Lamaas asked, Pray, what is faith?  
**26.** And Jesus said, Faith is the surety of the omnipotence of God
and man; the certainty that man will reach the deific life.  
**27.** Salvation is a ladder reaching from the heart of man to heart of
God.  
**28.** It has three steps; Belief is first, and this is what man
thinks, perhaps, is truth.  
**29.** And faith is next, and this is what man knows is truth.  
**30.** Fruition is the last, and this is man himself, the truth.  
**31.** Belief is lost in faith; and in fruition is lost; and man is
saved when he has reached deific life; when he and God are one.
