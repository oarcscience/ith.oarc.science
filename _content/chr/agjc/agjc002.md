# WHO WAS LEVI?

In response to inquiries from many friends of "The Aquarian Gospel of
Jesus the Christ" for some information regarding the transcriber, we
herewith give a short sketch. It was his great desire that each one
should have the message regardless of the messenger.

LEVI (Levi H. Dowling), was born Friday morning, May 18, 1844, at
Belleville, Ohio. His father, Scotch-Welsh descent, was a pioneer
preacher among the Disciples of Christ. Levi was always a student of the
deeper things of life. At the age of thirteen, in his first public
debate, he took the negative side against a Presbyterian Elder on "The
Everlasting Punishment of the Wicked."

He began preaching at the age of sixteen; and at the age of eighteen was
pastor of a small church. He entered the United States Army at the age
of twenty as Chaplain, and served in this capacity to the end of the
Civil War. In 1866-7 he was a student at Northwestern Christian
University at Indianapolis, Indiana. The next year he began publishing
Sunday School Literature, issuing Sunday School Lesson Papers, Song
Books, and a Children's Sunday School Paper. Much of his time was
devoted to the cause of Prohibition. He was a graduate of two medical
colleges and practised medicine for a number of years. He finally
retired from the medical profession to resume literary work.

Early in life, when but a mere lad, he had a vision in which he was told
that he was to "build a white city." This vision was repeated three
times with years intervening. The building of the "white city" was "The
Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ." This book was transcribed between
the early morning hours of two and six--the absolutely "quiet hours."

Levi passed from earth-life August 13, 1911.
