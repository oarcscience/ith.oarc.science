<p>Ravanna sees Jesus in the temple and is captivated. Hillel tells him about the boy. Ravanna finds Jesus in Nazareth and gives a feast in his honour. Ravanna becomes patron of Jesus, and takes him to India to study the Brahmic religion.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>A royal prince of India, Ravanna of Orissa in the south, was at the Jewish feast.<br> <b>2. </b>Ravanna was a man of wealth; and he was just, and with a band of Brahmic priests sought wisdom in the West.<br> <b>3. </b>When Jesus stood among the Jewish priests and read and spoke, Ravanna heard and was amazed.<br> <b>4. </b>And when he asked who Jesus was, from whence he came and what he was, chief Hillel said,<br> <b>5. </b>We call this child the Day Star from on high, for he has come to bring to men a light, the light of life; to lighten up the way of men and to redeem his people, Israel.<br> <b>6. </b>And Hillel told Ravanna all about the child; about the prophecies concerning him; about the wonders of the night when he was born; about the visit of the magian priests;<br> <b>7. </b>About the way in which he was protected from the wrath of evil men; about his flight to Egypt-land, and how he then was serving with his father as a carpenter in Nazareth.<br> <b>8. </b>Ravanna was entranced, and asked to know the way to Nazareth, that he might go and honour such a one as son of God.<br> <b>9. </b>And with his gorgeous train he journeyed on the way and came to Nazareth of Galilee.<br> <b>10. </b>He found the object of his search engaged in building dwellings for the sons of men.<br> <b>11. </b>And when he first saw Jesus he was climbing up a twelve step ladder, and he carried in his hands a compass, square and axe.<br> <b>12. </b>Ravanna said, All hail, most favoured son of heaven!<br> <b>13. </b>And at the inn Ravanna made a feast for all the people of the town; and Jesus and his parents were honoured guests.<br> <b>14. </b>For certain days Ravanna was a guest in Joseph's home on Marmion Way; he sought to learn the secret of the wisdom of the son; but it was all to great for him.<br> <b>15. </b>And then he asked that he might be the patron of the child; might take him to the East where he could learn the wisdom of the Brahms.<br> <b>16. </b>And Jesus longed to go that he might learn; and after many days his parents gave consent.<br> <b>17. </b>Then, with proud heart, Ravanna with his train, began the journey towards the rising sun; and after many days they crossed the Sind, and reached the province of Orissa, and the palace of the prince.<br> <b>18. </b>The Brahmic priests were glad to welcome home the prince; with favour they received the Jewish boy.<br> <b>19. </b>And Jesus was accepted as a pupil in the temple Jagannath; and here learned the Vedas and the Manic laws.<br> <b>20. </b>The Brahmic masters wondered at the clear conceptions of the child, and often were amazed when he explained to them the meaning of the laws.</p>
