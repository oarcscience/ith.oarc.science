#### Chapter 130

Jesus and the three disciples return to Cæsarea-Philippi. The nine had
failed to cure an epileptic child. Jesus heal it and rebukes his
disciples for their lack of trust in God. The Christines return to
Capernaum.  
  
**1.** When Jesus, Peter, James and John were come unto the city's gates
a multitude of people thronged the way.  
**2.** The nine apostles who went not with Jesus to the mount, had tried
to heal an epileptic child who was obsessed waited for the coming of the
Lord.  
**3.** When Jesus came the father of the child knelt down before him and
implored his help.  
**4.** He said, My master, I beseech that you will look in pity on my
son, my only child; he is an epileptic child and suffers grievously.  
**5.** Sometimes he falls into the fire and is burned; again he falls
into the water and is like to drown; and many times a day he falls, he
grinds his teeth, the foam pours from his mouth.  
**6.** I took my child to your disciples, and they failed to give
relief.  
**7.** And as he spoke a servant brought the child before the Lord (the
child spoke not, for he was dumb), and instantly he fell upon the
ground, he foamed, he writhed in agony.  
**8.** And Jesus said, How long has he been troubled thus?  
**9.** The father said, From infancy; and we have sought in many lands
for help, but found it not; but I believe that you can speak the Word
and heal my son.  
**10.** And Jesus said, Faith is the power of God. All things are
possible for him who in his heart believes.  
**11.** The father cried, in tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine
unbelief.  
**12.** And Jesus spoke the Word of power; the epileptic child lay in a
swoon; he did not breathe, and all the people said, The child is dead.  
**13.** But Jesus took him by the hand and said: Arise; and he arose and
spoke.  
**14.** The people were amazed, and many said, This surely is a man of
God, for no such power was ever given to man.  
**15.** Then Jesus and the twelve went to the house, and after they had
taken food and been refreshed, the nine disciples said,  
**16.** Lord, why could we not heal this child? We spoke the Word; but
even that was powerless.  
**17.** And Jesus said, Your great success in all your former work has
made you careless, and you forgot to recognise the power of God.  
**18.** Without the spirit of the Word, the Word is like an idle tale;
and you forgot to pray.  
**19.** There is no faith without the prayer of faith. Faith is the
wings of prayer; but wings alone fly not.  
**20.** By prayer and faith you can bring down the mountain peaks, and
cast them in the sea; the little hills will skip about like lambs at
your command.  
**21.** This failure may be well for you. The great lessons that are
learned in life come through the failures that are made.  
**22.** As the disciples sat in thoughtful meditation Jesus said, Let
these words sink into your hearts:  
**23.** The time has nearly come when you must bear your load alone;
that is, without my presence in the flesh.  
**24.** For I will fall into the hands of wicked men, and they will slay
me on a mount beyond Bezetha wall.  
**25.** And men will lay my body in a tomb where, by the sacred Word, it
will be guarded and preserved three days; then I will rise again.  
**26.** The twelve were sad; they did not understand, and yet they
feared to ask him to reveal the meaning of his word.  
**27.** Next day the Christine master and the twelve began their journey
of return, and soon were in Capernaum.
