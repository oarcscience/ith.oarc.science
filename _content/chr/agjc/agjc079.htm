<p></p> <h4>Chapter 76</h4> <i>
<p>Jesus in Bethlehem. Explains the Empire of Peace to the shepherds. An unusual light appears. The shepherds recognise Jesus as the Christ.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>The Logos went to Bethlehem, and many people followed him.<br> <b>2. </b>He found the shepherd's home where he was cradled when a babe; here he abode.<br> <b>3. </b>He went up to the hills where more than thirty years before the shepherds watched their flocks and heard the messenger of peace exclaim:<br> <b>4. </b>At midnight in a cave in Bethlehem the Prince of Peace is born.<br> <b>5. </b>And shepherds still were there, and sheep still fed upon the hills.<br> <b>6. </b>And in the valley near great flocks of snow-white doves were flying to and fro.<br> <b>7. </b>And when the shepherds knew that Jesus, whom the people called the king, had come, they came from near and far to speak to him.<br> <b>8. </b>And Jesus said to them, Behold the life of innocence and peace!<br> <b>9. </b>White is the symbol of the virtuous and pure! the lamb of innocence; the dove of peace;<br> <b>10. </b>And it was meet that love should come in human form amid such scenes as these.<br> <b>11. </b>Our father Abraham walked through these vales, and on these very hills he watched his flocks and herds.<br> <b>12. </b>And here it was that one, the Prince of Peace, the king of Salim, came; the Christ in human form; a greater far than Abraham was he.<br> <b>13. </b>And here it was that Abraham gave to this king of Salim, tithes of all he had.<br> <b>14. </b>This Prince of Peace went forth in battle everywhere. He had no sword; no armour of defence; no weapons of offence;<br> <b>15. </b>And yet he conquered men, and nations trembled at his feet.<br> <b>16. </b>The hosts of Egypt quailed before this sturdy king of right; the kings of Egypt placed their crowns upon his head,<br> <b>17. </b>And gave into his hands the sceptre of all Egypt land, and not a drop of blood was shed, and not a captive placed in chains;<br> <b>18. </b>But everywhere the conqueror threw wide the prison doors and set the captives free.<br> <b>19. </b>And, once again, the Prince of Peace has come, and from these blessed hills he goes again to fight.<br> <b>20. </b>And he is clothed in white; his sword is truth, his shield is faith; his helmet is innocence; his breath is love; his watchword peace.<br> <b>21. </b>But this is not a carnal war; it is not man at war with man; but it is right against the wrong.<br> <b>22. </b>And love is captain, love is warrior, love is armour, love is all, and love shall win.<br> <b>23. </b>And then again the hills of Bethlehem were clothed with light, again the messenger exclaimed,<br> <b>24. </b>Peace, peace on earth, good will to men.<br> <b>25. </b>And Jesus taught the people; healed the sick; revealed the mysteries of the kingdom of the Holy One.<br> <b>26. </b>And many said, He is the Christ; the king who was to come has come; Praise God.</p>
