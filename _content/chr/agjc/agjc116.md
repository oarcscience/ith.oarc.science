#### Chapter 113

In answer to a question of Lamaas Jesus teaches a lesson on the reign of
peace and the way to it through antagonisms. The signs of the times.
Guidance of the Holy Breath. The Christines go to Bethsaida.  
  
**1.** Now, after they had dined, the guests and Jesus all were in a
spacious hall in Mary's home.  
**2.** And then Lamaas said, Pray, tell us Lord, is this the dawn of
peace?  
**3.** Have we come forth unto the time when men will war no more?  
**4.** Are you, indeed, the Prince of Peace that holy men said would
come?  
**5.** And Jesus said, Peace reigns to-day; it is the peace of death.  
**6.** A stagnant pool abides in peace. When waters cease to move they
soon are ladened with the seeds of death; corruption dwells in every
drop.  
**7.** The living waters always leap and skip about like lambs in
spring.  
**8.** The nations are corrupt; they sleep within the arms of death and
they must be aroused before it is too late.  
**9.** In life we find antagonists at work. God sent me here to stir
unto its depths the waters of the sea of life.  
**10.** Peace follows strife; I come to slay this peace of death. The
prince of peace must first be prince of strife.  
**11.** This leaven of truth which I have brought to men will stir the
demons up, and nations, cities, families will be at war within
themselves.  
**12.** The five that have been dwelling in a home of peace will be
divided now, and two shall war with three;  
**13.** The son will stand against his sire; the mother and the daughter
will contend; yea, strife will reign in every home.  
**14.** The self and greed and doubt will rage into a fever heat, and
then, because of me, the earth will be baptised in human blood.  
**15.** But right is king; and when the smoke is cleared away the
nations will learn war no more; the Prince of Peace will come to
reign.  
**16.** Behold, the signs of what I say are in the sky; but men can see
them not.  
**17.** When men behold a cloud rise in the west they say, A shower of
rain will come, and so it does; and when the wind blows from the south
they say, The weather will be hot; and it is so.  
**18.** Lo, men can read the signs of earth and sky, but they cannot
discern the signs of Holy Breath; but you shall know.  
**19.** The storm of wrath comes on; the carnal man will seek a cause to
hale you into court, and cast you into prison cells.  
**20.** And when these times shall come let wisdom guide; do not resent.
Resentment makes more strong the wrath of evil men.  
**21.** There is a little sense of justice and of mercy in the vilest
men of earth.  
**22.** By taking heed to what you do and say and trusting in the
guidance of the Holy Breath, you may inspire this sense to grow.  
**23.** You thus may make the wrath of men to praise the Lord.  
**24.** The Christines went their way, and came unto Bethsaida and
taught.
