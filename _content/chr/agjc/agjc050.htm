<p></p> <h4>SECTION XI<br> <br> CAPH<br> <br> Life and Works of Jesus in Egypt</h4> <h4>Chapter 47</h4> <i>
<p>Jesus with Elihu and Salome in Egypt. Tells the story of his journeys. Elihu and Salome praise God. Jesus goes to the temple in Heliopolis and is received as a pupil.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>And Jesus came to Egypt land and all was well. He tarried not upon the coast; he went at once to Zoan, home of Elihu and Salome, who five and twenty years before had taught his mother in their sacred school.<br> <b>2. </b>And there was joy when met these three. When last the son of Mary saw these sacred groves he was a babe;<br> <b>3. </b>And now a man grown strong by buffeting of every kind; a teacher who had stirred the multitudes in many lands.<br> <b>4. </b>And Jesus told the aged teachers all about his life; about his journeyings in foreign lands; about the meetings with the masters and about his kind receptions by the multitudes.<br> <b>5. </b>Elihu and Salome heard his story with delight; they lifted up their eyes to heaven and said,<br> <b>6. </b>Our Father-God, let now thy servants go in peace, for we have seen the glory of the Lord;<br> <b>7. </b>And we have talked with him, the messenger of love, and of the covenant of peace on earth, good will to men.<br> <b>8. </b>Through him shall all the nations of the earth be blest; through him, Immanuel.<br> <b>9. </b>And Jesus stayed in Zoan many days; and then went forth unto the city of the sun, that men call Heliopolis, and sought admission to the temple of the sacred brotherhood.<br> <b>10. </b>The council of the brotherhood convened, and Jesus stood before the hierophant; he answered all the questions that were asked with clearness and with power.<br> <b>11. </b>The hierophant exclaimed, Rabboni of the rabbinate, why come you here? Your wisdom is the wisdom of the gods; why seek for wisdom in the halls of men?<br> <b>12. </b>And Jesus said, In every way of earth-life I would walk; in every hall of learning I would sit; the heights that any man has gained, these I would gain;<br> <b>13. </b>What any man has suffered I would meet, that I may know the griefs, the disappointments and the sore temptations of my brother man; that I may know just how to succour those in need.<br> <b>14. </b>I pray you, brothers, let me go into your dismal crypts; and I would pass the hardest of your tests.<br> <b>15. </b>The master said, Take then the vow of secret brotherhood. And Jesus took the vow of secret brotherhood.<br> <b>16. </b>Again the master spoke; he said, The greatest heights are gained by those who reach the greatest depths; and you shall reach the greatest depths.<br> <b>17. </b>The guide then led the way and in the fountain Jesus bathed; and when he had been clothed in proper garb he stood again before the hierophant.</p>
