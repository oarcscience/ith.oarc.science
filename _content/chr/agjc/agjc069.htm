<p></p> <h4>Chapter 66</h4> <i>
<p>Six of John's disciples follow Jesus and become his disciples. He teaches them. They sit in the Silence.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>Among the followers of John were many men from Galilee. The most devout were Andrew, Simon, James, and John, with Philip and his brother of Bethsaida.<br> <b>2. </b>One day as Andrew, Philip and a son of Zebedee, were talking with the harbinger, the Logos came, and John exclaimed, Behold the Christ!<br> <b>3. </b>And then the three disciples followed Jesus, and he asked, What do you seek?<br> <b>4. </b>And the disciples asked, Where do you live? And Jesus answered, Come and see.<br> <b>5. </b>And Andrew called his brother Simon, saying, Come with me, for I have found the Christ.<br> <b>6. </b>When Jesus looked in Simon's face he said, Behold a rock! and Peter is your name.<br> <b>7. </b>And Philip found Nathaniel sitting by a tree, and said, My brother, come with me, for I have found the Christ! In Nazareth he abides.<br> <b>8. </b>Nathaniel said, Can anything of good come out of Nazareth? And Philip answered, Come and see.<br> <b>9.</b> When Jesus saw Nathaniel come he said, Behold an Israelite indeed in whom there is no guile!<br> <b>10. </b>Nathaniel said, How can you speak about me thus?<br> <b>11. </b>And Jesus said, I saw you as you sat beneath the fig tree over there, before your brother called.<br> <b>12. </b>Nathaniel lifted up his hands and said, This surely is the Christ, the king, for whom the harbinger has often testified.<br> <b>13. </b>And John went forth and found his brother James, and brought him to the Christ.<br> <b>14. </b>The six disciples went with Jesus to the place where he abode.<br> <b>15. </b>And Peter said, We long have sought for Christ. We came from Galilee to John; we thought that he was Christ, but he confessed to us that he was not;<br> <b>16. </b>That he was but the harbinger sent forth to clear the way, and make the pathway easy for the coming king; and when you came he said, Behold the Christ!<br> <b>17. </b>And we would gladly follow where you go. Lord, tell us what to do.<br> <b>18. </b>And Jesus said, The foxes of the earth have homes, the birds have nests; I have no, place to lay my head.<br> <b>19. </b>He who would follow me must give up all cravings of the self and lose his life in saving life.<br> <b>20. </b>I come to save the lost, and man is saved when he is rescued from himself. But men are slow to comprehend this doctrine of the Christ.<br> <b>21. </b>And Peter said, I cannot speak for any other man, but for myself I speak: I will leave all and follow where you lead.<br> <b>22. </b>And then the others spoke and said, You have the words of truth; you came from God, and if we follow in your footsteps we cannot miss the way.<br> <b>23. </b>Then Jesus and the six disciples sat a long, long time in silent thought.</p>
