#### Chapter 75

Nicodemus visits Jesus in the night. Jesus reveals to him the meaning of
the new birth and the kingdom of heaven.  
  
**1.** Nicodemus was a ruler of the Jews, and he was earnest, learned
and devout.  
**2.** He saw the master's signet in the face of Jesus as he talked, but
was not brave enough to publicly confess his faith in him;  
**3.** So in the night he went to talk with Jesus at the home of Jude.  
**4.** When Jesus saw him come he said, Full blessed are the pure in
heart;  
**5.** Twice blessed are the fearless, pure in heart;  
**6.** Thrice blessed are the fearless, pure in heart who dare to make
confession of their faith before the highest courts.  
**7.** And Nicodemus said, Hail, master, hail! I know you are a teacher
come from God, for man alone could never teach as you have taught; could
never do the works that you have done.  
**8.** And Jesus said, Except a man be born again he cannot see the
king; he cannot comprehend the words I speak.  
**9.** And Nicodemus said, How can a man be born again? Can he go back
into the womb and come again to life?  
**10.** And Jesus said, The birth of which I speak is not the birth of
flesh.  
**11.** Except a man be born of water and the Holy Breath, he cannot
come into the kingdom of the Holy One.  
**12.** That which is born of flesh is child of man; that which is born
of Holy Breath is child of God.  
**13.** The winds blow where they please; men hear their voices, and may
note results; but they know not from whence they come, nor where they
go; and so is every one that is born of Holy Breath.  
**14.** The ruler said, I do not understand; pray tell me plainly what
you mean.  
**15.** And Jesus said, The kingdom of the Holy One is in the soul; men
cannot see it with their carnal eyes; with all their reasoning powers
they comprehend it not.  
**16.** It is a life deep hid in God; its recognition is the work of
inner consciousness.  
**17.** The kingdoms of the world are kingdoms of the sight; the kingdom
of the Holy One is that of faith; its king is love.  
**18.** Men cannot see the love of God unmanifest, and so our Father-God
has clothed this love with flesh--flesh of a son of man.  
**19.** And that the world may see and know this love made manifest, the
son of man must needs be lifted up.  
**20.** As Moses in the wilderness raised up the serpent for the healing
of the flesh, the son of man must be raised up.  
**21.** That all men bitten by the serpent of the dust, the serpent of
the dust, the serpent of this carnal life, may live.  
**22.** He who believes in him shall have eternal life.  
**23.** For God so loved the world that he sent forth his only son to be
raised up that men may see the love of God.  
**24.** God did not send his son to judge the world; he sent him forth
to save the world; to bring men to the light.  
**25.** But men love not the light, for light reveals their wickedness;
men love the dark.  
**26.** Now, every one who loves the truth comes to the light; he does
not fear to have his works made manifest.  
**27.** The light had come, and Nicodemus went his way; he knew the
meaning of the birth of Holy Breath; he felt the presence of the Spirit
in his soul.  
**28.** And Jesus tarried in Jerusalem for many days and taught and
healed the sick.  
**29.** The common people gladly listened to his words, and many left
their all of carnal things and followed him.
