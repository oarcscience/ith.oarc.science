<p></p> <h4>Chapter 22</h4> <i>
<p>The friendship of Jesus and Lamaas. Jesus explains to Lamaas the meaning of truth, man, power, understanding, wisdom, salvation and faith.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>Among the priests of Jagannath was one who loved the Jewish boy. Lamaas Bramas was the name by which the priest was known.<br> <b>2. </b>One day as Jesus and Lamaas walked alone in plaza Jagannath, Lamaas said, My Jewish master, what is truth?<br> <b>3. </b>And Jesus said, Truth is the only thing that changes not.<br> <b>4. </b>In all the world there are two things; the one is truth; the other falsehood is; and truth is that which is, and falsehood that which seems to be.<br> <b>5. </b>Now truth is aught, and has no cause, and yet it is the cause of everything.<br> <b>6. </b>Falsehood is naught, and yet it is the manifest of aught.<br> <b>7. </b>Whatever has been made will be unmade; that which begins must end.<br> <b>8. </b>All things that can be seen by human eyes are manifests of aught, are naught, and so must pass away.<br> <b>9. </b>The things we see are but reflexes just appearing, while the ethers vibrate so and so, and when conditions change they disappear.<br> <b>10. </b>The Holy Breath is truth; is that which was, and is, and evermore shall be; it cannot change nor pass away.<br> <b>11. </b>Lamaas said, You answer well; now, what is man?<br> <b>12. </b>And Jesus said, Man is the truth and falsehood strangely mixed.<br> <b>13. </b>Man is the Breath made flesh; so truth and falsehood are conjoined in him; and they strive, and naught goes down and man as truth abides.<br> <b>14. </b>Again Lamaas asked, What do you say of power?<br> <b>15. </b>And Jesus said, It is a manifest; is the result of force; it is but naught; it is illusion, nothing more. Force changes not, but power changes as the ethers change.<br> <b>16. </b>Force is the will of God and is omnipotent, and power is that will in manifest, directed by the Breath.<br> <b>17. </b>There is power in the winds, a power in the waves, a power in the lightning's stroke, a power in the human arm, a power in the eye.<br> <b>18. </b>The ethers cause there powers to be, and thought of Elohim, of angel, man, or other thinking thing, directs the force; when it has done its work the power is no more.<br> <b>19. </b>Again Lamaas asked, Of understanding what have you to say?<br> <b>20. </b>And Jesus said, It is the rock on which man builds himself; it is the gnosis of the aught and of the naught, of falsehood and of truth.<br> <b>21. </b>It is the knowledge of the lower self; the sensing of the powers of man himself.<br> <b>22. </b>Again Lamaas asked, Of wisdom what have you to say?<br> <b>23. </b>And Jesus said, It is the consciousness that man is aught; that God and man are one;<br> <b>24. </b>That naught is naught; that power is but illusion; that heaven and earth and hell are not above, around, below, but in; which in the light of aught becomes the naught, and God is all.<br> <b>25. </b>Lamaas asked, Pray, what is faith?<br> <b>26. </b>And Jesus said, Faith is the surety of the omnipotence of God and man; the certainty that man will reach the deific life.<br> <b>27. </b>Salvation is a ladder reaching from the heart of man to heart of God.<br> <b>28. </b>It has three steps; Belief is first, and this is what man thinks, perhaps, is truth.<br> <b>29. </b>And faith is next, and this is what man knows is truth.<br> <b>30. </b>Fruition is the last, and this is man himself, the truth.<br> <b>31. </b>Belief is lost in faith; and in fruition is lost; and man is saved when he has reached deific life; when he and God are one.</p>
