<p></p> <h4>Chapter 74</h4> <i>
<p>Jesus heals on the Sabbath, and is censured by the Pharisees. Restores a drowned child. Rescued a wounded dog. Cares for a homeless child. Speaks on the law of kindness.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>It was the Sabbath day, and Jesus stood among the surging masses of the people in the temple courts and sacred halls.<br> <b>2. </b>The blind, the deaf, the dumb, and those obsessed were there, and Jesus spoke the Word, and they were healed.<br> <b>3. </b>On some he laid his hands, and they were healed; to others he just spoke the Word, and they were full restored to health; but others had to go and wash in certain pools; and others he anointed with a holy oil.<br> <b>4. </b>A doctor asked him why he healed in divers ways, and he replied,<br> <b>5. </b>Disease is discord in the human form, and discords are produced in many ways.<br> <b>6. </b>The body is a harpsichord; sometimes the strings are too relaxed, and then inharmony results.<br> <b>7. </b>Sometimes we find the strings too tense, and then another form of discord is induced.<br> <b>8. </b>Disease is many-formed, and these are many ways to cure, to tune anew the mystic harpsichord.<br> <b>9. </b>Now when the Pharisees were told that Jesus healed the people on the Sabbath day they were enraged, and they commanded him to quit the place.<br> <b>10. </b>But Jesus said, Was man designed to fit the Sabbath, or was the Sabbath day designed to fit the man?<br> <b>11. </b>If you had fallen in a pit and, lo, the Sabbath day had come, and I should pass your way, would you cry out.<br> <b>12. </b>Let me alone; it is a sin to help me on the Sabbath day; I'll swelter in this filth until another day?<br> <b>13. </b>You Pharisees, you hypocrites! you know you would be glad to have my help upon the Sabbath day, or any other day.<br> <b>14. </b>These people all have fallen into pits, and they are calling loud for me to help them out, and man and God would curse me should I pass along and heed them not.<br> <b>15. </b>And then the Pharisees returned to say their prayers, and curse the man of God because he heeded not their words.<br> <b>16. </b>Now, in the evening Jesus stood beside a pool; a playful child had fallen in, and it was drowned, and friends were bearing it away.<br> <b>17. </b>But Jesus called the carriers to stop; and then he stretched himself upon the lifeless form, and breathed into its mouth the breath of life.<br> <b>18. </b>And then he called aloud unto the soul that had gone out, and it returned; the child revived and lived.<br> <b>19. </b>And Jesus saw a wounded dog; it could not move; it lay beside the way and groaned with pain. He took it in his arms and bore it to the home where he abode.<br> <b>20. </b>He poured the healing oil into the wounds; he cared for it as though it were a child till it was strong and well.<br> <b>21. </b>And Jesus saw a little boy who had no home, and he was hungry; when he called for bread the people turned away.<br> <b>22. </b>And Jesus took the child and gave him bread; he wrapped him in his own warm coat, and found for him a home.<br> <b>23. </b>To those who followed him the master said, If man would gain again his lost estate he must respect the brotherhood of life.<br> <b>24. </b>Whoever is not kind to every form of life--to man, to beast, to bird, and creeping thing--cannot expect the blessings of the Holy One; for as we give, so God will give to us.</p>
