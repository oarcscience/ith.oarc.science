#### Chapter 77

Jesus in Hebron. Goes to Bethany. Advises Ruth regarding certain family
troubles.  
  
**1.** With three disciples Jesus went to Hebron where he tarried seven
days and taught.  
**2.** And then he went to Bethany and in the home of Lazarus he
taught.  
**3.** The evening came; the multitudes were gone, and Jesus, Lazarus,
and his sisters, Martha, Ruth and Mary, were alone.  
**4.** And Ruth was sore distressed. Her home was down in Jericho; her
husband was the keeper of an inn; his name was Asher-ben.  
**5.** Now, Asher was a Pharisee of strictest mien and thought, and he
regarded Jesus with disdain.  
**6.** And when his wife confessed her faith in Christ, he drove her
from his home.  
**7.** But Ruth resisted not; she said, If Jesus is the Christ he knows
the way, and I am sure He is the Christ.  
**8.** My husband may become enraged and slay my human form; he cannot
kill the soul, and in the many mansions of my Fatherland I have a
dwelling-place.  
**9.** And Ruth told Jesus all; and then she said, What shall I do?  
**10.** And Jesus said, Your husband is not willingly at fault; he is
devout; he prays to God, our Father-God.  
**11.** His zeal for his religion is intense; in this he is sincere; but
it has driven him insane, and he believes it right to keep his home
unsullied by the heresy of Christ.  
**12.** He feels assured that he has done the will of God in driving you
away.  
**13.** Intolerance is ignorance matured.  
**14.** The light will come to him some day, and then he will repay for
all your heartaches, griefs and tears.  
**15.** And Ruth, you must not think that you are free from blame.  
**16.** If you had walked in wisdom's ways, and been content to hold
your peace, this grief would not have come to you.  
**17.** It takes a long, long time for light to break into the shell of
prejudice, and patience is the lesson you have need to learn.  
**18.** The constant dropping of the water wears away the hardest
stone.  
**19.** The sweet and holy incense of a godly life will melt intolerance
much quicker than the hottest flame, or hardest blow.  
**20.** Just wait a little time, and then go home with sympathy and
love. Talk not of Christ, nor of the kingdom of the Holy One.  
**21.** Just life a godly life; refrain from harshness in your speech,
and you will lead your husband to the light.  
**22.** And it was so.
