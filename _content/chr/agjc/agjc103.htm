<p></p> <h4>Chapter 100</h4> <i>
<p>The Sermon on the Mount, continued. Jesus formulates and presents to the twelve a practical code of spiritual ethics.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>There is a rule that carnal man has made, and which he rigidly observes:<br> <b>2. </b>Do unto other men as they do unto you. As others judge, they judge; as others give, they give.<br> <b>3. </b>Now, while you walk with men as men, judge not, and you shall not be judged.<br> <b>4. </b>For as you judge you shall be judged, and as you give it shall be given to you. If you condemn, you are condemned.<br> <b>5. </b>When you show mercy, men are merciful to you, and if you love in such a way that carnal man can comprehend your love, you will be well beloved.<br> <b>6. </b>And so the wise man of this world does unto other men as he would have them do to him.<br> <b>7. </b>The carnal man does good to other men for selfish gain, for he expects to have his blessings multiplied and then returned; he does not stop to note the end.<br> <b>8. </b>Man is himself the field; his deeds are seeds, and what he does to others grows apace; the harvest time is sure.<br> <b>9. </b>Behold the yield! If he has sown the wind, he reaps the wind; if he has sown the noxious seeds of scandal, theft and hate; of sensuality and crime,<br> <b>10. </b>The harvest is assured and he must reap what he has sown; yea, more; the seeds produce an hundred fold.<br> <b>11. </b>The fruit of righteousness and peace and love and joy can never spring from noxious seeds; the fruit is like the seed.<br> <b>12. </b>And when you sow, sow seeds of right, because it is the right, and not in the way of trade, expecting rich rewards.<br> <b>13. </b>The carnal man abhors the spirit law, because it takes away his liberty to live in sin; beneath its light he cannot satisfy his passions and desires.<br> <b>14. </b>He is at enmity with him who walks in Holy Breath. The carnal man has killed the holy men of old, the prophets and the seers.<br> <b>15. </b>And he will buffet you; will charge you falsely, scourge you and imprison you, and think he does the will of God to slay you in the streets.<br> <b>16. </b>But you may not prejudge nor censure him who does you wrong.<br> <b>17. </b>Each one has problems to be solved, and he must solve them for himself.<br> <b>18. </b>The man who scourges you may have a load of sin to bear; but how about your own?<br> <b>19. </b>A little sin in one who walks in Holy Breath is greater in the sight of God than monster sins in him who never knew the way.<br> <b>20. </b>How can you see the splinter in your brother's eye while you have chunks within your own?<br> <b>21. </b>First take the chunks from out your eye and then you may behold the splinter in your brother's eye and help him take it out,<br> <b>22. </b>And while your eyes are full of foreign things you cannot see the way, for you are blind,<br> <b>23. </b>And when the blind lead forth the blind, both lose the way and fall into the slough.<br> <b>24. </b>If you would lead the way to God you must be clear in sight, as well as pure in heart.</p>
