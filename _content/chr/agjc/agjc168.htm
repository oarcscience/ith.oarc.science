<p>Jesus before Caiaphas. Peter denies his Lord thrice. The indictment, signed by seven ruling Jews. A hundred perjured witnesses testify to the truth of the charges.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>Caiaphas was the high priest of the Jews; the mob led Jesus to his palace hall.<br> <b>2. </b>The court had been convened, and all the galleries were packed with scribes and Pharisees already sworn as witnesses against the Lord.<br> <b>3. </b>The maid who kept the palace door knew John and this disciple asked that he and Peter be admitted to the hall.<br> <b>4. </b>The maid permitted them to enter in, and John went in; but Peter was afraid and tarried in the outer court.<br> <b>5. </b>The woman said to Peter, as he stood beside the door, Are you a follower of this man from Galilee?<br> <b>6. </b>And Peter said, No, I am not.<br> <b>7. </b>The men who had brought Jesus to the hall sat by a fire in the outer court, because the night was cool, and Peter sat with them.<br> <b>8. </b>Another maid who waited in the place saw Peter and she said to him, You surely are from Galilee; your speech is that of Galilee; you are a follower of this man.<br> <b>9. </b>And Peter said, I know not what you mean; I do not even know this man.<br> <b>10. </b>And then a servant of Caiaphas, one of those who seized the Lord and brought him to the court, saw Peter and he said to him,<br> <b>11. </b>Did I not see you in the orchard of Massalian with this seditious Nazarene? I'm sure I did, and you are one of those who followed him.<br> <b>12. </b>Then Peter rose and stamped upon the floor, and swore by every sacred thing, that he knew not the criminal.<br> <b>13. </b>Now, John was standing near and when he heard the words and knew that Peter had denied his Lord, he looked at him in sheer astonishment.<br> <b>14. </b>Just then a cock crew loud beneath the court, and Peter called to mind the words the Lord had said,<br> <b>15. </b>Before the cock shall crow to-morrow morn you will deny me thrice.<br> <b>16. </b>And Peter's conscience smote him heavily, and he went out into the night and wept.<br> <b>17. </b>Caiaphas sat in state; before him stood the man from Galilee.<br> <b>18. </b>Caiaphas said, You people of Jerusalem, who is the man that you accuse?<br> <b>19. </b>They answered: In the name of every loyal Jew we do accuse this man from Galilee, this Jesus, who assumes to be our king, as enemy of God and man.<br> <b>20. </b>Caiaphas said to Jesus, Man, you are permitted now to speak and tell about your doctrines and your claims.<br> <b>21. </b>And Jesus said, You priest of carnal man, why do you ask about my words and works?<br> <b>22. </b>Lo, I have taught the multitudes in every public place; I have restored your sick to health; have caused your deaf to hear, your lame to walk, and I have brought your dead to life again.<br> <b>23. </b>My works have not been done in secret place but in your public halls and thoroughfares.<br> <b>24. </b>Go ask the people, who have not been bought with gold or glittering promises, to tell about my words and works.<br> <b>25. </b>When Jesus had thus said a Jewish guard came up and smote him in the face and said, How dare you speak thus unto him, the high priest of the Jews?<br> <b>26. </b>And Jesus said, If I have spoken falsely bear witness unto what I say; If I have told the truth why did you smite me thus?<br> <b>27. </b>And then Caiaphas said, What'er you, do in a legal way, for we must answer to a higher court for everything we do or say.<br> <b>28. </b>Let the accusers of this man present their charges in a legal form.<br> <b>29. </b>And then Caiaphas' scribe stood forth and said, I have the accusations here in legal form; the charges made and signed by scribes and priests and Pharisees.<br> <b>30. </b>Caiaphas said, Be still, you men, and hear the charges read. The scribe took up a roll and read:<br> <b>31. </b>To the Sanhedrim of the Jews and to Caiaphas the high priest, most honoured men:<br> <b>32. </b>The highest duty man can render is to his nation and his own is to protect them from their foes.<br> <b>33. </b>The people of Jerusalem are conscious that a mighty foe is in their very midst.<br> <b>34. </b>A man named Jesus has come forth and claims to be heir to David's throne.<br> <b>35. </b>As an imposter he is foe, and in the name of every loyal Jew we here submit these charges which we are competent to prove;<br> <b>36. </b>At first, he blasphemes God; he says he is son of God; that he and God are one;<br> <b>37. </b>And he profanes our holy days by healing, and doing other work upon the Sabbath days;<br> <b>38. </b>And he proclaims himself the king, successor of our David and our Solomon;<br> <b>39. </b>And he declares that he will tear our temple down and build it up again in form more glorious in three days;<br> <b>40. </b>And he declares that he will drive the people from Jerusalem, as he drove out the merchants from the temple court; and bring to occupy our sacred hills a tribe of men that know not God;<br> <b>41. </b>And he aver that every doctor, scribe and Pharisee and Sadducee, shall go in exile, and shall never more return;<br> <b>42. </b>And to these charges we do set our hands and seals. Annas. Simon. Abinadab. Annanias. Joash. Azaniah. Hezekiah.<br> <b>43. </b>Now, when the scribe had read the charges, all the people called for blood; they said, Let such a wretch be stoned; let him be crucified.<br> <b>44. </b>Caiaphas said, You men of Israel, do you sustain the charges of these men?<br> <b>45. </b>A hundred men who had been bribed, stood forth to testify; they swore that every charge was true.<br> <b>46. </b>Caiaphas said to Jesus, Man, have you a word to say? are you the son of God?<br> <b>47. </b>And Jesus said, So you have said; and then he said no more.</p>
