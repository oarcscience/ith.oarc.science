#### Chapter 110

Miriam sings a song of victory. The song. Jesus reveals the symbolic
character of the journey of Israel from Egypt to Canaam.  
  
**1.** And Miriam stood before the surging crowd, and casting up her
eyes to heaven she sung anew the song of victory:  
**2.** Bring forth the harp, the vina and the lyre; bring forth the
highest sounding cymbal, all ye choirs of heaven. Join in the song, the
new, new song.  
**3.** The Lord of hosts has stooped to hear the cries of men, and lo,
the citadel of Beelzebul is shaking as a leaf before the wind.  
**4.** The sword of Gideon is again unsheathed.  
**5.** The Lord, with his own hand has pulled far back the curtains of
the night; the sun of truth is flooding heaven and earth;  
**6.** The demons of the dark, of ignorance and death, are fleeing fast;
are disappearing as the dew beneath the morning sun.  
**7.** God is our strength and song; is our salvation and our hope, and
we will build anew a house for him;  
**8.** Will cleanse our hearts, and purify their chambers, every one. We
are the temple of the Holy Breath.  
**9.** We need no more a tent within the wilderness; no more a temple
built with hands.  
**10.** We do not seek the Holy Land, nor yet Jerusalem.  
**11.** We are the tent of God; we are his temple built without the
sound of edged tools.  
**12.** We are the Holy Land; we are the New Jerusalem; Allelujah,
praise the Lord!  
**13.** And when the song was done the multitudes exclaimed, Praise
God.  
**14.** And Jesus said, Behold the way!  
**15.** The sons of men have groped for ages in the darkness of Egyptian
night.  
**16.** The Pharaohs of sense have bound them with their chains.  
**17.** But God has whispered through the mists of time and told them of
a land of liberty and love.  
**18.** And he has sent his Logos forth to light the way.  
**19.** The Red Sea rolls between the promised land and Egypt's sands.  
**20.** The Red Sea is the carnal mind.  
**21.** Behold, the Logos reaches out his hand; the sea divides; the
carnal mind is reft in twain; the sons of men walk through dry shod.  
**22.** The Pharaohs of sense would stay them in their flight; the
waters of the sea return; the Pharaohs of sense are lost and men are
free.  
**23.** For just a little while men tread the wilderness of Sin; the
Logos leads the way;  
**24.** And when at last men stand upon the Jordan's brink, these waters
stay, and men step forth into their own.
