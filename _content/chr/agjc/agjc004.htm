<p>Palestine. Birth of Mary, Joachim's feast. Mary is blessed by the priests. His prophecy. Mary abides in the temple. Is betrothed to Joseph.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>Augustus C&aelig;sar reigned and Herod Antipas was ruler of Jerusalem.<br> <b>2. </b>Three provinces comprised the land of Palistine: Judea, and Samaria, and Galilee.<br> <b>3. </b>Joachim was a master of the Jewish law, a man of wealth; he lived in Nazareth of Galilee; and Anna, of the tribe of Judah, was his wife.<br> <b>4. </b>To them was born a child, a goodly female child, and they were glad; and Mary was the name they gave the child.<br> <b>5. </b>Joachim made a feast in honour of the child; but he invited not the rich, the honoured and the great; he called the poor the halt and the lame, the blind, and to each one he gave a gift of raiment, food or other needful thing.<br> <b>6. </b>He said, The Lord has given me this wealth; I am his steward by his grace, and if I give not to his children when in need, then he will make this wealth a curse.<br> <b>7. </b>Now, when the child was three years old her parents took her to Jerusalem, and in the temple she received the blessings of the priests.<br> <b>8. </b>The high priest was a prophet and a seer, and when he saw the child he said,<br> <b>9. </b>Behold, this child will be the mother of an honoured prophet and a master of the law; she shall abide within this holy temple of the Lord.<br> <b>10. </b>And Mary did abide within the temple of the Lord; and Hillel, chief of the Sanhedrim, taught her all the precepts of Jews, and she delighted in the law of God.<br> <b>11. </b>When Mary reached the age of womanhood she was betrothed to Joseph, son of Jacob, and a carpenter of Nazareth.<br> <b>12. </b>And Joseph was an upright man, and a devoted Essenes.</p>
