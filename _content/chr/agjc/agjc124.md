#### Chapter 121

The Christines are in Nazareth. Miriam sings a Christine song of praise.
Jesus teaches in the synagogue. He heals a dumb man who is obsessed. The
people do not believe in him. The Pharisees call him a tool of
Beelzebul. The Christines go to Cana.  
  
**1.** It was a gala day in Nazareth. The people there had met with one
accord to celebrate some great event.  
**2.** And Jesus and the foreign masters and the twelve, and Mary,
mother of the Lord, and Miriam were there.  
**3.** And when the people were assembled in the great hall of the town,
the graceful singer, Miriam, stood and sang a song of praise.  
**4.** But few of all the multitude knew who the singer was; but
instantly she won all hearts.  
**5.** For many days she sang the songs of Israel, and then she went her
way.  
**6.** The Sabbath came and Jesus went into the synagogue. He took the
book of Psalms and read:  
**7.** Blest is the man who puts his trust in God, respecting not the
proud nor such as turn aside to lies.  
**8.** O lord, my God, the works that thou hast done for us are
wonderful; and many are thy thoughts for us; we cannot count them all,  
**9.** Thou dost not call for sacrifice, nor offerings of blood; burnt
offerings and offerings for sin thou dost not want;  
**10.** And lo, I come to do thy will, O God, thy law is in my heart,  
**11.** And I have preached the word of righteousness and peace unto the
thronging multitudes; I have declared the counsel of my God in full.  
**12.** I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have
declared thy faithfulness and grace.  
**13.** I have not kept thy loving-kindness and thy truth away from men;
I have declared them to the multitudes.  
**14.** O Lord, make wide my lips that I may tell thy praise; I do not
bring the sacrifice of blood, nor yet burnt offerings for sin.  
**15.** The sacrifices I would bring to thee, O God, are purity in life,
a contrite heart, a spirit full of faith and love, and these thou wilt
receive.  
**16.** And when he had thus read, he gave the book back to the keeper
of the books, and then he said,  
**17.** Upon these ends of earth these messages of God have come.  
**18.** Our people have exalted sacrificial rites and have neglected
mercy, justice and the rights of men.  
**19.** You Pharisees, you priests, you scribes, your God surfeited with
blood; God does not heed your prayers; you stand before your burning
victims; but you stand in vain.  
**20.** Turn you unto the testimonies of the law; reform and turn to
God, and you shall live.  
**21.** Let not your altars be accursed again with smoke of innocence.  
**22.** Bring unto God as sacrifice a broken and a contrite heart.  
**23.** Lift from your fellow men the burdens that you have imposed.  
**24.** And if you hearken not, and if you turn not from your evil ways,
lo, God will smite this nation with a curse.  
**25.** And when he had thus said he stood aside, and all the people
were astonished, and they said,  
**26.** Where did this man get all his knowledge and his power? From
whence did all this wisdom come?  
**27.** Is not this Mary's son, whose home is out on Marmion Way?  
**28.** Are not his brothers, Jude and James and Simon, known among our
honoured men? Are not his sisters with us here?  
**29.** But they were all offended by the words he spoke.  
**30.** And Jesus said, A prophet has no honour in his native land; he
is not well received among his kin; his foes are in his home.  
**31.** And Jesus wrought not many mighty works in Nazareth, because the
people had no faith in him. He did not tarry long.  
**32.** But as he passed from thence two blind men followed him and
cried, Thou son of David, hear! Have mercy, Lord, and open up our eyes
that we may see.  
**33.** And Jesus said, Do you believe that I can open up your eyes and
make you see?  
**34.** They said, Yea, Lord, we know that if you speak the Word then we
can see.  
**35.** And Jesus touched their eyes and spoke the Word; he said,
According to your faith so will it be.  
**36.** And they were blest; they opened up their eyes and saw.  
**37.** And Jesus said, Tell not this thing to any one.  
**38.** But they went forth and told the news through all the land.  
**39.** As Jesus walked along the way a man who was obsessed, and who
was dumb, was brought to him.  
**40.** And Jesus spoke the Word; the unclean spirit came out of the
man; his tongue was loosed; he spoke; he said, Praise God.  
**41.** The people were amazed; They said, This is a mighty deed; we
never saw that done before.  
**42.** The Pharisees were also much amazed; but they cried out and
said,  
**43.** You men of Israel, take heed; this Jesus is a tool of Beelzebul;
he heals the sick and casts the spirits out in Satan's name.  
**44.** But Jesus answered not; he went his way.  
**45.** And with the foreign masters and the twelve he went up to the
town where he once turned the water into wine, and tarried certain days.
