#### Chapter 46

A storm on the sea. Jesus rescues many drowning men. The Athenians pray
to idols. Jesus rebukes their idolatry and tells how God helps. His last
meeting with the Greeks. Sails on the vessel Mars.  
  
**1.** It was a holy day and Jesus walked upon the Athens beach.  
**2.** A storm was on and ships were being tossed about like toys upon
the bosom of the sea.  
**3.** The sailors and the fishermen were going down to watery graves;
the shores were strewn with bodies of the dead.  
**4.** And Jesus halted not, but with a mighty power he rescued many a
helpless one, oft bringing back to life the seeming dead.  
**5.** Now, on these shores were altars sacred to the gods supposed to
rule the seas.  
**6.** And men and women, heedless of the cries of drowning men were
crowding all about these altars calling on their gods for help.  
**7.** At length the storm was done, and all the sea was calm, and men
could think again; and Jesus said,  
**8.** You worshippers of wooden gods, how has the fury of this storm
been lessened by your frantic prayers?  
**9.** Where is the strength of these poor, weather-beaten gods with
painted swords and crowns?  
**10.** A god that could abide in such a little house could hardly hold
a frantic fly, and who could hope that he could hold at bay the Lords of
winds and waves?  
**11.** The mighty powers of worlds unseen do not give forth their help
till men have done their best; they only help when men can do no more.  
**12.** And you have agonised and prayed around these shrines, and let
men sink to death who might have been, by your assistance, saved.  
**13.** The God that saves dwells in your souls, and manifests by making
use of your own feet, and legs, and arms, and hands.  
**14.** Strength never comes through idleness; nor through a waiting for
another one to bear your loads, or do the work that you are called to
do.  
**15.** But when you do your best to bear your loads, and do your work,
you offer unto God a sacrifice well-pleasing in his sight.  
**16.** And then the Holy One breathes deep upon your glowing
sacrificial coals, and makes them blaze aloft to fill your souls with
light, and strength and helpfulness.  
**17.** The most efficient prayer that men can offer to a god of any
kind is helpfulness to those in need of help; for what you do for other
men the Holy One will do for you.  
**18.** And thus God helps.  
**19.** His work in Greece was done, and Jesus must go on his way to
Egypt in the South. Apollo, with the highest masters of the land and
many people from the varied walks of life, stood on the shore to see the
Hebrew sage depart; and Jesus said,  
**20.** The son of man has been in many lands; has stood in temples of a
multitude of foreign gods; has preached the gospel of good will and
peace on earth to many people, tribes and tongues;  
**21.** Has been received with favour in a multitude of homes; but
Greece is, of them all, the royal host.  
**22.** The breadth of Grecian thought; the depth of her philosophy; the
height of her unselfish aspirations have well fitted her to be the
champion of the cause of human liberty and right.  
**23.** The fates of war have subjugated Greece, because she trusted in
the strength of flesh, and bone and intellect, forgetful of the
spirit-life that binds a nation to its source of power.  
**24.** But Greece will not for ever sit within the darkness of the
shadow land as vassal of a foreign king.  
**25.** Lift up your heads, you men of Greece; the time will come when
Greece will breathe the ethers of the Holy Breath, and be a mainspring
of the spirit power of earth.  
**26.** But God must be your shield, your buckler, and your tower of
strength.  
**27.** And then he said, Farewell. Apollo raised his hand in silent
benediction, and the people wept.  
**28.** Upon the Cretan vessel, Mars, the Hebrew sage sailed from the
Grecian port.
