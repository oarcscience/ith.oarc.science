#### SECTION XVIII  TZADDI  The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus

#### Chapter 159

The Christines attend a feast in Simon's house. Mary anoints the master
with a costly balm, and Judas and others rebuke her for profligacy.
Jesus defends her. The rulers of the Jews employ Ananias to arrest
Jesus. Ananias bribes Judas to aid him.  
  
**1.** Bar-Simon, who was once a leper and was cleansed by Jesus by the
sacred Word, abode in Bethany.  
**2.** In honour of the Christine Lord he gave a feast, and Lazarus was
among the guests, and Ruth and Martha served.  
**3.** And as the guests reclined about the table, Mary took a cruse of
rich perfume and poured it out on Jesus' head and feet.  
**4.** And then she knelt and with her hair she wiped his feet; the
odour of the rich perfume filled all the room.  
**5.** Now, Judas, always looking at the selfish side of life,
exclaimed, For shamed, why did you waste that costly perfume thus?  
**6.** We might have sold it for three hundred pence, and had the money
to supply our wants and feed the poor.  
**7.** (Now, Judas was the treasurer, and carried all the money of the
Christine band.)  
**8.** And others said, Why, Mary, what a profligate you are! You should
not throw such wealth away.  
**9.** But Jesus said, You men, be still; let her alone; you know not
what you say.  
**10.** The poor are with you constantly; at any time you can administer
to them; but I will not be with you long.  
**11.** And Mary knows the sadness of the coming days; she has anointed
me beforehand for my burial.  
**12.** The gospel of the Christ will everywhere be preached, and he who
tells the story of the Christ will tell about this day; and what was
done by Mary at this hour will be a sweet memorial to her wherever men
abide.  
**13.** And when the feast was over Jesus went with Lazarus to his
home.  
**14.** Now, in Jerusalem the priests and Pharisees were busy with their
plans to seize the Lord and take his life.  
**15.** The high priest called a counsel all the wisest men and said,
This deed must be accomplished in a secret way.  
**16.** He must be taken when the multitudes are not a-near, else we may
cause a war; the common people may stand forth in his defence and thus
pollute this sacred place with human blood.  
**17.** And what we do, that we must do before the great day of the
feast.  
**18.** And Ananias said, I have a plan that will succeed. The twelve
with Jesus every day go forth alone to pray;  
**19.** And we will find their trysting place; then we can seize the man
and bring him here without the knowledge of the multitudes.  
**20.** I know one of the twelve, a man who worships wealth, and for a
sum I think that he will lead the way to where the man is wont to
pray.  
**21.** And then Caiaphas said, If you will lead the way and bribe the
man of whom you speak, to aid in seizing Jesus in a secret place, then
we will give to you a hundred silver pieces for your hire.  
**22.** And Ananias said, 'Tis well.  
**23.** And then he went to Bethany and found the twelve at Simon's
house and, calling Judas to the side he said,  
**24.** If you would care to make a sum of money for yourself hear me:  
**25.** The high priest and other rulers in Jerusalem would like to talk
with Jesus when alone, that they may know about his claims;  
**26.** And if he proves himself to be the Christ, lo, they will stand
in his defence.  
**27.** Now, if you will but lead the way to where your master is
tomorrow night that they may send a priest to talk with him alone, there
is a sum of silver, thirty pieces, that the priests will give to you:  
**28.** And Judas reasoned with himself; he said, It surely may be well
to give the Lord a chance to tell the priests about his claims when he
is all alone.  
**29.** And if the priests would do him harm he has the power to
disappear and go his way as he has done before; and thirty pieces is a
goodly sum.  
**30.** And so he said to Ananias, I will lead the way, and by a kiss
make known which person is the Lord.
