#### Chapter 9

Salome's lessons. The man and the woman. Philosophy of human moods. The
triune God. The Septonate. The God Tao.  
  
**1.** Salome taught the lesson of the day. She said, All times are not
alike. Today the words of man may have the greatest power; to-morrow
women teaches best.  
**2.** In all the ways of life the man and woman should walk hand in
hand; the one without the other is but half; each has a work to do.  
**3.** But all things teach; each has a time and a season for its own.
The sun, the moon have lessons of their own for men; but each one
teaches at the appointed time.  
**4.** The lessons of the sun fall down on human hearts like withered
leaves upon a stream, if given in the season of the moon and all the
stars.  
**5.** To-day one walks in gloom, downhearted and oppressed; tomorrow
that same one is filled with joy.  
**6.** To-day the heavens seem full of blessedness and hope; tomorrow
hope has fled, and every plan and purpose comes to naught.  
**7.** To-day one wants to curse the very ground on which he treads;
tomorrow he is full of love and praise.  
**8.** To-day one hates and scorns and envies and is jealous of the
child he loves; tomorrow he has risen above his carnal self, and
breathes forth gladness and good-will.  
**9.** A thousand times men wonder why these heights and depths, these
light hearts and these sad, are found in every life.  
**10.** They do not know that there are teachers everywhere, each busy
with a God- appointed task, and driving home to human hearts the
truth.  
**11.** But this is true, and every one receives the lessons that he
needs.  
**12.** And Mary said, To-day I am in exultation great; my thoughts and
all my life seem lifted up; why am I thus inspired?  
**13.** Salome replied, This is a day of exultation; day of worship and
of praise; a day when, in a measure, we may comprehend our Father-God.  
**14.** Then let us study God, the One, the Three, the Seven.  
**15.** Before the worlds were formed all things were One; just Spirit,
Universal Breath.  
**16.** And Spirit breathed, and that which was not manifest became the
Fire and Thought of Heaven, the Father-God, the Mother-God.  
**17.** And when the Fire and Thought of heaven in union breathed, their
son, their only son, was born. This son is Love whom men have called the
Christ.  
**18.** Men call the Thought of heaven the Holy Breath.  
**19.** And when the Triune God breathed forth, lo, seven Spirits stood
before the throne. These are Elohim, creative spirits of the universe.  
**20.** And these are they who said, Let us make man; and in their image
man was made.  
**21.** In early ages of the world the dwellers in the farther East
said, Tao is the name of Universal Breath; and in the ancient books we
read,  
**22.** No manifesting form has Tao Great, and yet he made and keeps the
heavens and earth.  
**23.** No passion has our Tao Great, and yet he causes sun and moon and
all the stars to rise and set.  
**24.** No name has Tao Great, and yet he makes all things to grow; he
brings in season both the seed time and the harvest time.  
**25.** And Tao Great was One; the One became the Two; the Two became
the Three, the Three evolved the Seven, which filled the universe with
manifests.  
**26.** And Tao Great gives unto all, the evil and the good, the rain,
the dew, the sunshine and the flowers; from his rich stores he feeds
them all.  
**27.** And in the same old book we read of man: He has a spirit knit to
Tao Great; a soul which lives within the seven Breaths of Tao Great; a
body of desires that springs up from the soil of flesh.  
**28.** Now spirit loves the pure, the good, the true; the body of
desires extols the selfish self; the soul becomes the battle ground
between the two.  
**29.** And blessed is the man whose spirit is triumphant and whose
lower self is purified; whose soul is cleansed, becoming fit to be the
council chamber of the manifests of Tao Great.  
**30.** Thus closed the lesson of Salome.
