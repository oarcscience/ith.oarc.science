#### Chapter 164

Judas betrays his Lord with a kiss. Jesus is seized by the mob and the
disciples flee to save their lives. Jesus is taken unto Jerusalem, Peter
and John follow the mob.  
  
**1.** The Lord with the eleven were in the orchard of Massalian, and as
they talked they saw a band of men with lanterns and with swords and
clubs approaching them.  
**2.** And Jesus said, Behold the emissaries of the evil one! and Judas
leads the way.  
**3.** And the disciples said, Lord, let us flee to save our lives.  
**4.** But Jesus said, Why should we flee to save our lives when this is
the fulfilment of the words of prophets and of seers?  
**5.** And Jesus went alone to meet the men; and as they came he said,
Why are you here, you men? whom do you seek?  
**6.** And they replied, We seek the man from Galilee. We seek for
Jesus, one who calls himself the Christ.  
**7.** And Jesus answered, Here am I.  
**8.** And then he raised his hands and with a mighty thought he brought
the ethers to the state of light; and all the orchard was aglow with
light.  
**9.** The frenzied men were driven back and many fled and tarried not
until they reached Jerusalem; and others fell upon their faces on the
ground.  
**10.** The bravest men, and they with hardest hearts, remained, and
when the light had paled, the Lord again inquired, Whom do you seek?  
**11.** And Ananias said, We seek the man from Galilee; we seek for
Jesus, he who calls himself the Christ.  
**12.** And Jesus answered him and said, I told you once before; but now
I tell you once again that I am he.  
**13.** By Ananias, Judas stood; but in a moment he had gone and coming
up behind the Lord he said, My Lord; and then he kissed him as a sign
that he was Jesus whom they sought.  
**14.** And Jesus said, Do you, Iscariot, come and thus betray your
master with a kiss?  
**15.** This thing must need be done; but woe to him who does betray his
Lord.  
**16.** Your carnal greed has seared your conscience and you know not
what you do; but in a little time your conscience will assert itself,
and in remorse, lo, you will close your span and take your life.  
**17.** Then the eleven came, laid hold of Judas and would have done him
harm; but Jesus said,  
**18.** You must not harm this man; you have no right to judge this man;
his conscience is his judge, will sentence him and he will execute
himself.  
**19.** And then the mob led on by Malchus, servant of Caiaphas, laid
hold of Jesus, and was binding him with chains.  
**20.** And Jesus said, Why do you come in dead of night with swords and
clubs to take me in this sacred place?  
**21.** Have I not spoken in the public places of Jerusalem? Have I not
healed you sick, and opened up your blinded eyes, and made your lame to
walk, your deaf to hear? You could have found me any day.  
**22.** And now you try to bind me down with chains, what are these
chains but links of reeds? And then he raised his hands; the chains were
broken and they fell to earth.  
**23.** And Malchus thought the Lord would flee to save his life, and
with a club he fain would smite him in the face.  
**24.** But Peter had a sword, and rushing up he smote the man and
wounded him.  
**25.** But Jesus said, Stay, Peter, stay; put up your sword; you are
not called to fight with swords and clubs. Whoever wields the sword
shall perish by the sword.  
**26.** I do not need protection by the sons of men, for I could call
this moment and a legion, yea, twelve legions of the messengers of God,
would come and stand in my defence; but then it is not well.  
**27.** And then he said to Malchus, Man, I would not have you harmed.
And then he laid his hand upon the wound that Peter made, and it was
healed.  
**28.** Then Jesus said, Be not concerned lest I should tear myself away
from you and flee to save my life. I have no wish to save my life; do
with me as you wish.  
**29.** And then the mob rushed up to seize the eleven to take them back
to stand for trial as the aids of Jesus in his crimes.  
**30.** But the disciples, every one of them, deserted Jesus, and they
fled to save their lives.  
**31.** Now, John was last to flee; the mob laid hold of him and tore
his garments all to shreds; but he escaped in nakedness.  
**32.** Massalian saw the man, and took him to his home and gave him
other clothes; and then he followed after them who led the Lord away.  
**33.** And Peter was ashamed because of his weak cowardice, and when he
was himself again he joined with John and followed close behind the mob,
and came into Jerusalem.
