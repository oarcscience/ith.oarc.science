#### SECTION XIX  KOPH  The Trial and Execution of Jesus

#### Chapter 165

Jesus before Caiaphas. Peter denies his Lord thrice. The indictment,
signed by seven ruling Jews. A hundred perjured witnesses testify to the
truth of the charges.  
  
**1.** Caiaphas was the high priest of the Jews; the mob led Jesus to
his palace hall.  
**2.** The court had been convened, and all the galleries were packed
with scribes and Pharisees already sworn as witnesses against the
Lord.  
**3.** The maid who kept the palace door knew John and this disciple
asked that he and Peter be admitted to the hall.  
**4.** The maid permitted them to enter in, and John went in; but Peter
was afraid and tarried in the outer court.  
**5.** The woman said to Peter, as he stood beside the door, Are you a
follower of this man from Galilee?  
**6.** And Peter said, No, I am not.  
**7.** The men who had brought Jesus to the hall sat by a fire in the
outer court, because the night was cool, and Peter sat with them.  
**8.** Another maid who waited in the place saw Peter and she said to
him, You surely are from Galilee; your speech is that of Galilee; you
are a follower of this man.  
**9.** And Peter said, I know not what you mean; I do not even know this
man.  
**10.** And then a servant of Caiaphas, one of those who seized the Lord
and brought him to the court, saw Peter and he said to him,  
**11.** Did I not see you in the orchard of Massalian with this
seditious Nazarene? I'm sure I did, and you are one of those who
followed him.  
**12.** Then Peter rose and stamped upon the floor, and swore by every
sacred thing, that he knew not the criminal.  
**13.** Now, John was standing near and when he heard the words and knew
that Peter had denied his Lord, he looked at him in sheer
astonishment.  
**14.** Just then a cock crew loud beneath the court, and Peter called
to mind the words the Lord had said,  
**15.** Before the cock shall crow to-morrow morn you will deny me
thrice.  
**16.** And Peter's conscience smote him heavily, and he went out into
the night and wept.  
**17.** Caiaphas sat in state; before him stood the man from Galilee.  
**18.** Caiaphas said, You people of Jerusalem, who is the man that you
accuse?  
**19.** They answered: In the name of every loyal Jew we do accuse this
man from Galilee, this Jesus, who assumes to be our king, as enemy of
God and man.  
**20.** Caiaphas said to Jesus, Man, you are permitted now to speak and
tell about your doctrines and your claims.  
**21.** And Jesus said, You priest of carnal man, why do you ask about
my words and works?  
**22.** Lo, I have taught the multitudes in every public place; I have
restored your sick to health; have caused your deaf to hear, your lame
to walk, and I have brought your dead to life again.  
**23.** My works have not been done in secret place but in your public
halls and thoroughfares.  
**24.** Go ask the people, who have not been bought with gold or
glittering promises, to tell about my words and works.  
**25.** When Jesus had thus said a Jewish guard came up and smote him in
the face and said, How dare you speak thus unto him, the high priest of
the Jews?  
**26.** And Jesus said, If I have spoken falsely bear witness unto what
I say; If I have told the truth why did you smite me thus?  
**27.** And then Caiaphas said, What'er you, do in a legal way, for we
must answer to a higher court for everything we do or say.  
**28.** Let the accusers of this man present their charges in a legal
form.  
**29.** And then Caiaphas' scribe stood forth and said, I have the
accusations here in legal form; the charges made and signed by scribes
and priests and Pharisees.  
**30.** Caiaphas said, Be still, you men, and hear the charges read. The
scribe took up a roll and read:  
**31.** To the Sanhedrim of the Jews and to Caiaphas the high priest,
most honoured men:  
**32.** The highest duty man can render is to his nation and his own is
to protect them from their foes.  
**33.** The people of Jerusalem are conscious that a mighty foe is in
their very midst.  
**34.** A man named Jesus has come forth and claims to be heir to
David's throne.  
**35.** As an imposter he is foe, and in the name of every loyal Jew we
here submit these charges which we are competent to prove;  
**36.** At first, he blasphemes God; he says he is son of God; that he
and God are one;  
**37.** And he profanes our holy days by healing, and doing other work
upon the Sabbath days;  
**38.** And he proclaims himself the king, successor of our David and
our Solomon;  
**39.** And he declares that he will tear our temple down and build it
up again in form more glorious in three days;  
**40.** And he declares that he will drive the people from Jerusalem, as
he drove out the merchants from the temple court; and bring to occupy
our sacred hills a tribe of men that know not God;  
**41.** And he aver that every doctor, scribe and Pharisee and Sadducee,
shall go in exile, and shall never more return;  
**42.** And to these charges we do set our hands and seals. Annas.
Simon. Abinadab. Annanias. Joash. Azaniah. Hezekiah.  
**43.** Now, when the scribe had read the charges, all the people called
for blood; they said, Let such a wretch be stoned; let him be
crucified.  
**44.** Caiaphas said, You men of Israel, do you sustain the charges of
these men?  
**45.** A hundred men who had been bribed, stood forth to testify; they
swore that every charge was true.  
**46.** Caiaphas said to Jesus, Man, have you a word to say? are you the
son of God?  
**47.** And Jesus said, So you have said; and then he said no more.
