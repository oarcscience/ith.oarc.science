<p></p> <h4>Chapter 152</h4> <i>
<p>Jesus rebukes a barren fig tree. Drives the merchants out of the temple. Teaches the people. Returns to Bethany.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>Next day, the Monday of the week, the master with the twelve, went to Jerusalem.<br> <b>2. </b>And as they passed along the way they saw a fig tree full of leaves without a sign of fruit.<br> <b>3. </b>And Jesus spoke unto the tree; he said, You useless cumberer of the ground; you fig tree fair to look upon, but a delusive thing.<br> <b>4. </b>You take from the earth and air the food that fruitful trees should have.<br> <b>5. </b>Go back to earth and be yourself the food for other trees to eat.<br> <b>6. </b>When Jesus had thus spoken to the tree he went his way.<br> <b>7. </b>And when he reached the temple, lo, the rooms were filled with petty merchants selling doves and animals, and other things, for sacrifice; the temple was a mart of trade.<br> <b>8. </b>And Jesus was indignant at the sight, and said, You men of Israel, for shame! This is supposed to be the house of prayer; but it is now a den of thieves. Remove this plunder from this holy place.<br> <b>9. </b>The merchants only laughed and said, We are protected in our trade by those who bear the rule; we will not go.<br> <b>10. </b>Then Jesus made a scourge of cords, as he did once before, and rushed among the merchantmen, threw all their money on the floor;<br> <b>11. </b>Threw wide the cages of the doves, and cut the cords that held the bleating lambs and set them free.<br> <b>12. </b>And then he drove the merchants from the place, and with a clean, new broom he swept the floors.<br> <b>13. </b>Chief priests and scribes were filled with wrath, but feared to touch or even to rebuke the Lord, for all the people stood in his defence.<br> <b>14. </b>And Jesus taught the people all day long and healed a multitude of those diseased,<br> <b>15. </b>And when the evening came he went again to Bethany.</p>
