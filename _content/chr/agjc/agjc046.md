#### Chapter 43

Jesus and Ashbina visit Babylon and remark its desolation. The two
masters remain in company seven days; then Jesus resumes his homeward
journey. Arrives in Nazareth. His mother gives a feast in his honour.
His brothers are displeased. Jesus tells his mother and aunt the story
of his journeys.  
  
**1.** The ruined Babylon was near, and Jesus and the sage went through
her gates and walked among her fallen palaces.  
**2.** They trod the streets where Israel once was held in base
captivity.  
**3.** They saw where Judah's sons and daughters hung their harps upon
the willows, and refused to sing.  
**4.** They saw where Daniel and the Hebrew children stood as living
witnesses of faith.  
**5.** And Jesus lifted up his hand and said, Behold the grandeur of the
works of man!  
**6.** The king of Babylon destroyed the temple of the Lord in old
Jerusalem; he burned the holy city, bound in chains my people and my
kin, and brought them here as slaves.  
**7.** But retribution comes; for whatsoever men shall do to other men
the righteous Judge will do to them.  
**8.** The sun of Babylon has gone down; the songs of pleasure will be
heard no more within her walls.  
**9.** And every kind of creeping thing and unclean bird will, in these
ruins, find their homes.  
**10.** And in the temple Belus, Jesus and Ashbina stood in silent
thought.  
**11.** Then Jesus spoke and said, Behold this monument of folly and of
shame.  
**12.** Man tried to shake the very throne of God, and he assayed to
build a tower to reach to heaven, when, lo, his very speech was snatched
away, because in lofty words he boasted of his power.  
**13.** And on these heights the heathen Baal stood--the god wrought out
by hands of man.  
**14.** Upon yon altar, birds, and beasts, and men, yea children have
been burned in awful sacrifice to Baal.  
**15.** But now the gory priests are dead; the very rocks have shuddered
and have fallen down; the place is desolate.  
**16.** Now, in the plains of Shinar Jesus tarried yet for seven days,
and, with Ashbina, meditated long upon the needs of men, and how the
sages could best serve the coming age.  
**17.** Then Jesus went his way, and after many days he crossed the
Jordan to his native land. At once he sought his home in Nazareth.  
**18.** His mother's heart was filled with joy; she made a feast for
him, inviting all her kindred and her friends.  
**19.** But Jesus' brothers were not pleased that such attention should
be paid to one they deemed a sheer adventurer, and they went not in to
the feast.  
**20.** They laughed their brother's claims to scorn; they called him
indolent, ambitious, vain; a worthless fortune hunter; searcher of the
world for fame, who, after many years returns to mother's home with
neither gold, nor any other wealth.  
**21.** And Jesus called aside his mother and her sister, Miriam, and
told them of his journey to the East.  
**22.** He told them of the lessons he had learned, and of the works
that he had done. To others he told not the story of his life.
