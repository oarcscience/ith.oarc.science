<p></p> <h4>Chapter 75</h4> <i>
<p>Nicodemus visits Jesus in the night. Jesus reveals to him the meaning of the new birth and the kingdom of heaven.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>Nicodemus was a ruler of the Jews, and he was earnest, learned and devout.<br> <b>2. </b>He saw the master's signet in the face of Jesus as he talked, but was not brave enough to publicly confess his faith in him;<br> <b>3. </b>So in the night he went to talk with Jesus at the home of Jude.<br> <b>4. </b>When Jesus saw him come he said, Full blessed are the pure in heart;<br> <b>5. </b>Twice blessed are the fearless, pure in heart;<br> <b>6. </b>Thrice blessed are the fearless, pure in heart who dare to make confession of their faith before the highest courts.<br> <b>7. </b>And Nicodemus said, Hail, master, hail! I know you are a teacher come from God, for man alone could never teach as you have taught; could never do the works that you have done.<br> <b>8. </b>And Jesus said, Except a man be born again he cannot see the king; he cannot comprehend the words I speak.<br> <b>9. </b>And Nicodemus said, How can a man be born again? Can he go back into the womb and come again to life?<br> <b>10. </b>And Jesus said, The birth of which I speak is not the birth of flesh.<br> <b>11. </b>Except a man be born of water and the Holy Breath, he cannot come into the kingdom of the Holy One.<br> <b>12. </b>That which is born of flesh is child of man; that which is born of Holy Breath is child of God.<br> <b>13. </b>The winds blow where they please; men hear their voices, and may note results; but they know not from whence they come, nor where they go; and so is every one that is born of Holy Breath.<br> <b>14. </b>The ruler said, I do not understand; pray tell me plainly what you mean.<br> <b>15. </b>And Jesus said, The kingdom of the Holy One is in the soul; men cannot see it with their carnal eyes; with all their reasoning powers they comprehend it not.<br> <b>16. </b>It is a life deep hid in God; its recognition is the work of inner consciousness.<br> <b>17. </b>The kingdoms of the world are kingdoms of the sight; the kingdom of the Holy One is that of faith; its king is love.<br> <b>18. </b>Men cannot see the love of God unmanifest, and so our Father-God has clothed this love with flesh--flesh of a son of man.<br> <b>19. </b>And that the world may see and know this love made manifest, the son of man must needs be lifted up.<br> <b>20. </b>As Moses in the wilderness raised up the serpent for the healing of the flesh, the son of man must be raised up.<br> <b>21. </b>That all men bitten by the serpent of the dust, the serpent of the dust, the serpent of this carnal life, may live.<br> <b>22. </b>He who believes in him shall have eternal life.<br> <b>23. </b>For God so loved the world that he sent forth his only son to be raised up that men may see the love of God.<br> <b>24. </b>God did not send his son to judge the world; he sent him forth to save the world; to bring men to the light.<br> <b>25. </b>But men love not the light, for light reveals their wickedness; men love the dark.<br> <b>26. </b>Now, every one who loves the truth comes to the light; he does not fear to have his works made manifest.<br> <b>27. </b>The light had come, and Nicodemus went his way; he knew the meaning of the birth of Holy Breath; he felt the presence of the Spirit in his soul.<br> <b>28. </b>And Jesus tarried in Jerusalem for many days and taught and healed the sick.<br> <b>29. </b>The common people gladly listened to his words, and many left their all of carnal things and followed him.</p>
