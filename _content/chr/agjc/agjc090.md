#### Chapter 87

The Christines go to Cana. Jesus heals a noblesman's child. The
Christines go to Capernaum. Jesus provides a spacious home for his
mother. He announces his intention to choose twelve apostles.  
  
**1.** In Nazareth Jesus taught no more; he went with his disciples up
to Cana, where, at a marriage feast, he once turned water into wine.  
**2.** And here he met a man of noble birth whose home was in Capernaum,
whose son was sick.  
**3.** The man had faith in Jesus' power to heal, and when he learned
that he had come to Galilee he went in haste to meet him on the way.  
**4.** The man met Jesus at the seventh hour, and he entreated him to
hasten to Capernaum to save hi son.  
**5.** But Jesus did not go; he stood aside in silence for a time, and
then he said, Your faith has proved a healing balm; your son is well.  
**6.** The man believed and went his way toward Capernaum and as he went
he met a servant from his home who said,  
**7.** My lord, You need not haste; your son is well.  
**8.** The father asked, When did my son begin to mend?  
**9.** The servant said, On yesterday about the seventh hour the fever
left.  
**10.** And then the father knew it was the healing balm that Jesus sent
that saved his son.  
**11.** In Cana Jesus tarried not he went his way with his disciples to
Capernaum, where he secured a spacious house where, with his mother, he
could live, where his disciples might repair to hear the Word.  
**12.** He called the men who had confessed their faith in him to meet
him in his home, which his disciples called, The school of Christ; and
when they came he said to them,  
**13.** This gospel of the Christ must be proclaimed in all the world.  
**14.** This Christine vine will be a mighty vine whose branches will
comprise the peoples, tribes and tongues of all the earth.  
**15.** I am the vine; twelve men shall be the branches of the stock,
and these shall send forth branches everywhere;  
**16.** And from among the people who have followed me, the Holy Breath
will call the twelve.  
**17.** Go now and do your work as you have done your work; but listen
for the call.  
**18.** Then the disciples went unto their daily tasks, to do their work
as they had done, and Jesus went alone into the Hammoth hills to pray.  
**19.** Three days and nights he spent communing with the Silent
Brotherhood; then, in the power of Holy breath he came to call the
twelve.
