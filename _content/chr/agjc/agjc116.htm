<p></p> <h4>Chapter 113</h4> <i>
<p>In answer to a question of Lamaas Jesus teaches a lesson on the reign of peace and the way to it through antagonisms. The signs of the times. Guidance of the Holy Breath. The Christines go to Bethsaida.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>Now, after they had dined, the guests and Jesus all were in a spacious hall in Mary's home.<br> <b>2. </b>And then Lamaas said, Pray, tell us Lord, is this the dawn of peace?<br> <b>3. </b>Have we come forth unto the time when men will war no more?<br> <b>4. </b>Are you, indeed, the Prince of Peace that holy men said would come?<br> <b>5. </b>And Jesus said, Peace reigns to-day; it is the peace of death.<br> <b>6. </b>A stagnant pool abides in peace. When waters cease to move they soon are ladened with the seeds of death; corruption dwells in every drop.<br> <b>7. </b>The living waters always leap and skip about like lambs in spring.<br> <b>8. </b>The nations are corrupt; they sleep within the arms of death and they must be aroused before it is too late.<br> <b>9. </b>In life we find antagonists at work. God sent me here to stir unto its depths the waters of the sea of life.<br> <b>10. </b>Peace follows strife; I come to slay this peace of death. The prince of peace must first be prince of strife.<br> <b>11. </b>This leaven of truth which I have brought to men will stir the demons up, and nations, cities, families will be at war within themselves.<br> <b>12. </b>The five that have been dwelling in a home of peace will be divided now, and two shall war with three;<br> <b>13. </b>The son will stand against his sire; the mother and the daughter will contend; yea, strife will reign in every home.<br> <b>14. </b>The self and greed and doubt will rage into a fever heat, and then, because of me, the earth will be baptised in human blood.<br> <b>15. </b>But right is king; and when the smoke is cleared away the nations will learn war no more; the Prince of Peace will come to reign.<br> <b>16. </b>Behold, the signs of what I say are in the sky; but men can see them not.<br> <b>17. </b>When men behold a cloud rise in the west they say, A shower of rain will come, and so it does; and when the wind blows from the south they say, The weather will be hot; and it is so.<br> <b>18. </b>Lo, men can read the signs of earth and sky, but they cannot discern the signs of Holy Breath; but you shall know.<br> <b>19. </b>The storm of wrath comes on; the carnal man will seek a cause to hale you into court, and cast you into prison cells.<br> <b>20. </b>And when these times shall come let wisdom guide; do not resent. Resentment makes more strong the wrath of evil men.<br> <b>21. </b>There is a little sense of justice and of mercy in the vilest men of earth.<br> <b>22. </b>By taking heed to what you do and say and trusting in the guidance of the Holy Breath, you may inspire this sense to grow.<br> <b>23. </b>You thus may make the wrath of men to praise the Lord.<br> <b>24. </b>The Christines went their way, and came unto Bethsaida and taught.</p>
