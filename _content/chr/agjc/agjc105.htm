<p></p> <h4>Chapter 102</h4> <i>
<p>The Christines at the home of Jesus. Jesus unfolds to them the secret doctrine. They go through all Galilee and teach and heal. Jesus brings to life the son of a widow at Nain. They return to Capernaum.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>The twelve apostles went with Jesus to his home, and there abode for certain days.<br> <b>2. </b>And Jesus told them many things about the inner life that may not now be written in a book.<br> <b>3. </b>Now, in Capernaum, there lived a man of wealth, a Roman captain of a hundred men, who loved the Jews and who had built for them a synagogue.<br> <b>4. </b>A servant of this man was paralysed, and he was sick nigh unto death.<br> <b>5. </b>The captain knew of Jesus and had heard that by the Sacred Word he healed the sick, and he had faith in him.<br> <b>6. </b>He sent a message by the elders of the Jews to Jesus, and he pled for help.<br> <b>7. </b>and Jesus recognised the captain's faith and went at once to heal the sick; the captain met him on the way and said to him,<br> <b>8. </b>Lo, Lord, it is not well that you should come unto my house; I am not worthy of the presence of a man of God.<br> <b>9. </b>I am a man of war, my life is spent with those who ofttimes take the lives of fellow men.<br> <b>10. </b>And surely he who comes to save would be dishonoured if he came beneath my roof.<br> <b>11. </b>If you will speak the Word I know my servant will be well.<br> <b>12. </b>And Jesus turned and said to those who followed him,<br> <b>13. </b>Behold the captain's faith; I have not seen such faith, no, not in Israel.<br> <b>14. </b>Behold, the feast is spread for you; but while you doubt and wait, the alien comes in faith and takes the bread of life.<br> <b>15. </b>Then turning to the man he said, Go on your way; according to your faith so shall it be; your servant lives.<br> <b>16. </b>It came to pass that at the time that Jesus spoke the Word the palsied man arose, and he was well.<br> <b>17. </b>And then the Christines went abroad to teach. And as they came to Nain, a city on the Hermon way, they saw a multitude about the gates.<br> <b>18. </b>It was a funeral train; a widow's son was dead, and friends were bearing out the body to the tomb.<br> <b>19. </b>It was the widow's only son, and she was wild with grief. And Jesus said to her, Weep not, I am the life; your son shall live.<br> <b>20. </b>And Jesus raised his hand; the bearers of the dead stood still.<br> <b>21. </b>And Jesus touched the bier and said, Young man, return.<br> <b>22. </b>The soul returned; the body of the dead was filled with life; the man sat up and spoke.<br> <b>23. </b>The people were astonished at the scene, and every one exclaimed, Praise God.<br> <b>24. </b>A Jewish priest stood forth and said, Behold a mighty prophet has appeared; and all the people said, Amen.<br> <b>25. </b>The Christines journeyed on; they taught, and healed the sick in many towns of Galilee, and then they came again unto Capernaum.</p>
