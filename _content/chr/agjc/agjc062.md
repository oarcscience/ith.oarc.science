#### Chapter 59

Meeting of the sages, continued. The remaining postulates. The sages
bless Jesus. Seven days' silence.  
  
**1.** Apollo wrote the fifth:  
**2.** The soul is drawn to perfect light by four white steeds, and
these are Will, and Faith, and Helpfulness and Love.  
**3.** That which one wills to do, he has the power to do.  
**4.** A knowledge of that power is faith; and when faith moves, the
soul begins its flight.  
**5.** A selfish faith leads not to light. There is no lonely pilgrim on
the way to light. Men only gain the heights by helping others gain the
heights.  
**6.** The steed that leads the way to spirit life is Love; is pure
unselfish Love.  
**7.** Matheno wrote the sixth:  
**8.** The universal Love of which Apollo speaks is child of Wisdom and
of Will divine, and God has sent if forth to earth in flesh that man may
know.  
**9.** The universal Love of which the sages speak, is Christ.  
**10.** The greatest mystery of all times lies in the way that Christ
lives in the heart.  
**11.** Christ cannot live in clammy dens of carnal things. The seven
battles must be fought, the seven victories won before the carnal
things, like fear, and self, emotions and desire, are put away.  
**12.** When this is done the Christ will take possession of the soul;
the work is done, and man and God are one.  
**13.** And Philo wrote the seventh:  
**14.** A perfect man! To bring before the Triune God a being such as
this was nature made.  
**15.** This consummation is the highest revelation of the mystery of
life.  
**16.** When all the essences of carnal things have been transmuted into
soul, and all the essences of soul have been returned to Holy Breath,
and man is made a perfect God, the drama of Creation will conclude. And
this is all.  
**17.** And all the sages said, Amen.  
**18.** Then Meng-ste said, The Holy One has sent to us a man illumined
by the efforts of unnumbered years, to lead the thoughts of men.  
**19.** This man, approved by all the master minds of heaven and earth,
this man from Galilee, this Jesus, chief of all the sages of the world,
we gladly recognise.  
**20.** In recognition of this wisdom that he brings to men, we crown
him with the Lotus wreath.  
**21.** We send him forth with all the blessing of the seven sages of
the world.  
**22.** Then all the sages laid their hands on Jesus' head, and said
with one accord, Praise God!  
**23.** For wisdom, honour, glory, power, riches, blessing, strength,
are yours, O Christ, for evermore.  
**24.** And every living creature said, Amen.  
**25.** And then the sages sat in silence seven days.
