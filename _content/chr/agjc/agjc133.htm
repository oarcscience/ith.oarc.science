<p></p> <h4>Chapter 130</h4> <i>
<p>Jesus and the three disciples return to C&aelig;sarea-Philippi. The nine had failed to cure an epileptic child. Jesus heal it and rebukes his disciples for their lack of trust in God. The Christines return to Capernaum.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>When Jesus, Peter, James and John were come unto the city's gates a multitude of people thronged the way.<br> <b>2. </b>The nine apostles who went not with Jesus to the mount, had tried to heal an epileptic child who was obsessed waited for the coming of the Lord.<br> <b>3. </b>When Jesus came the father of the child knelt down before him and implored his help.<br> <b>4. </b>He said, My master, I beseech that you will look in pity on my son, my only child; he is an epileptic child and suffers grievously.<br> <b>5. </b>Sometimes he falls into the fire and is burned; again he falls into the water and is like to drown; and many times a day he falls, he grinds his teeth, the foam pours from his mouth.<br> <b>6. </b>I took my child to your disciples, and they failed to give relief.<br> <b>7. </b>And as he spoke a servant brought the child before the Lord (the child spoke not, for he was dumb), and instantly he fell upon the ground, he foamed, he writhed in agony.<br> <b>8. </b>And Jesus said, How long has he been troubled thus?<br> <b>9. </b>The father said, From infancy; and we have sought in many lands for help, but found it not; but I believe that you can speak the Word and heal my son.<br> <b>10. </b>And Jesus said, Faith is the power of God. All things are possible for him who in his heart believes.<br> <b>11. </b>The father cried, in tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.<br> <b>12. </b>And Jesus spoke the Word of power; the epileptic child lay in a swoon; he did not breathe, and all the people said, The child is dead.<br> <b>13. </b>But Jesus took him by the hand and said: Arise; and he arose and spoke.<br> <b>14. </b>The people were amazed, and many said, This surely is a man of God, for no such power was ever given to man.<br> <b>15. </b>Then Jesus and the twelve went to the house, and after they had taken food and been refreshed, the nine disciples said,<br> <b>16. </b>Lord, why could we not heal this child? We spoke the Word; but even that was powerless.<br> <b>17. </b>And Jesus said, Your great success in all your former work has made you careless, and you forgot to recognise the power of God.<br> <b>18. </b>Without the spirit of the Word, the Word is like an idle tale; and you forgot to pray.<br> <b>19. </b>There is no faith without the prayer of faith. Faith is the wings of prayer; but wings alone fly not.<br> <b>20. </b>By prayer and faith you can bring down the mountain peaks, and cast them in the sea; the little hills will skip about like lambs at your command.<br> <b>21. </b>This failure may be well for you. The great lessons that are learned in life come through the failures that are made.<br> <b>22. </b>As the disciples sat in thoughtful meditation Jesus said, Let these words sink into your hearts:<br> <b>23. </b>The time has nearly come when you must bear your load alone; that is, without my presence in the flesh.<br> <b>24. </b>For I will fall into the hands of wicked men, and they will slay me on a mount beyond Bezetha wall.<br> <b>25. </b>And men will lay my body in a tomb where, by the sacred Word, it will be guarded and preserved three days; then I will rise again.<br> <b>26. </b>The twelve were sad; they did not understand, and yet they feared to ask him to reveal the meaning of his word.<br> <b>27. </b>Next day the Christine master and the twelve began their journey of return, and soon were in Capernaum.</p>
