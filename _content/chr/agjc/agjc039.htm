<p>Jesus in Lassa. He meets Meng-ste who aids him in reading the ancient manuscripts. He goes to Ladak. Heals a child. Relates the parable of the king's son.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>In Lassa of Tibet there was a master's temple, rich in manuscripts of ancient lore.<br> <b>2. </b>The Indian sage had read these manuscripts, and he revealed to Jesus many of the secret lessons they contained; but Jesus wished to read them for himself.<br> <b>3. </b>Now, Meng-ste, greatest sage of all the farther East, was in this temple of Tibet.<br> <b>4. </b>The path across Emodus heights was difficult; but Jesus started on his way, and Vidyapati sent with him a trusted guide.<br> <b>5. </b>And Vidyapati sent a message to Meng-ste, in which he told about the Hebrew sage, and spoke for him a welcome by the temple priests.<br> <b>6. </b>Now, after many days, and perils great, the guide and Jesus reached the Lassa temple in Tibet.<br> <b>7. </b>And Meng-ste opened wide the temple doors, and all the priests and masters gave a welcome to the Hebrew sage.<br> <b>8. </b>And Jesus had access to all the sacred manuscripts, and, with the help of Meng- ste, read them all.<br> <b>9. </b>And Meng-ste often talked with Jesus of the coming age, and of the sacred service best adapted to the people of the age.<br> <b>10. </b>In Lassa Jesus did not teach. When he finished all his studies in the temple schools he journeyed toward the West. In many villages he tarried for a time and taught.<br> <b>11. </b>At last he reached the pass, and in the Ladak city, Leh, he was received with favour by the monks, the merchants, and the men of low estate.<br> <b>12. </b>And in the monastery he abode, and taught; and then he sought the common people in the marts of trade; and there he taught.<br> <b>13. </b>Not far away a woman lived, whose infant son was sick nigh unto death. The doctors had declared, There is no hope; the child must die.<br> <b>14. </b>The woman heard that Jesus was a teacher sent from God, and she believed that he had power to heal her son.<br> <b>15. </b>And so she clasped the dying infant in her arms and ran with haste and asked to see the man of God.<br> <b>16. </b>When Jesus saw her faith he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said,<br> <b>17. </b>My Father-God, let power divine o'ershadow me, and let the Holy Breath fill full this child that it may live.<br> <b>18. </b>And in the presence of the multitude he laid his hand upon the child and said,<br> <b>19. </b>Good woman you are blest; your faith has saved your son. And then the child was well.<br> <b>20. </b>The people were astonished and they said, This surely is the Holy One made flesh, for man alone cannot a fever thus and save a child from death.<br> <b>21. </b>Then many of the people brought their sick, and Jesus spoke the Word, and they were healed.<br> <b>22. </b>Among the Ladaks Jesus tarried many days; he taught them how to heal; how sins are blotted out, and how to make on earth a heaven of joy.<br> <b>23. </b>The people loved him for his words and works, and when he must depart they grieved as children grieve when mother goes away.<br> <b>24. </b>And on the morning when he started on his way the multitudes were there to press his hand.<br> <b>25. </b>To them he spoke a parable; he said, A certain king so loved the people of his land that he sent forth his only son with precious gifts for all.<br> <b>26. </b>The son went everywhere and scattered forth the gifts with lavish hand.<br> <b>27. </b>But there were priests who ministered at shrines of foreign gods, who were not pleased because the king did not through them bestow the gifts.<br> <b>28. </b>And so they sought to cause the people all to hate the son. They said, These gifts are not of any worth; they are but counterfeits.<br> <b>29. </b>And so the people threw the precious gems, and gold and silver in the streets. They caught the son and beat him, spit upon him, drove him from their midst.<br> <b>30. </b>The son resented not their insults and their cruelties; but thus he prayed, My Father-God, forgive these creatures of thy hand; they are but slaves; they know not what they do.<br> <b>31. </b>And while they yet were beating him he gave them food, and blest them with a boundless love.<br> <b>32. </b>In certain cities was the son received with joy, and he would gladly have remained to bless the homes; but he could tarry not, for he must carry gifts to every one in all the king's domain.<br> <b>33. </b>And Jesus said, My Father-God is king of all mankind, and he has sent me forth with all the bounties of his matchless love and boundless wealth.<br> <b>34. </b>To all the people of all lands, lo, I must bear these gifts--this water and this bread of life.<br> <b>35. </b>I go my way, but we will meet again; for in my Fatherland is room for all; I will prepare a place for you.<br> <b>36. </b>And Jesus raised his hand in silent benediction; then he went his way.</p>
